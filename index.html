            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2026/02/gamehub-will-give-mac-owners-another-imperfect-way-to-play-windows-games/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">For a while now, Mac owners have been able to use tools like CrossOver and Game Porting Toolkit to get many Windows games running on their operating system of choice. Now, GameSir plans to add its own potential solution to the mix, announcing that a version of its existing Windows emulation tool for Android will be coming to macOS.

Hong Kong-based GameSir has primarily made a name for itself as a manufacturer of gaming peripherals—the company’s social media profile includes a self-description as “the Anti-Stick Drift Experts.” Early last year, though, GameSir rolled out the Android GameHub app, which includes a GameFusion emulator that the company claims “provides complete support for Windows games to run on Android through high-precision compatibility design.”

In practice, GameHub and GameFusion for Android haven’t quite lived up to that promise. Testers on Reddit and sites like EmuReady report hit-or-miss compatibility for popular Steam titles on various Android-based handhelds. At least one Reddit user suggests that “any Unity, Godot, or Game Maker game tends to just work” through the app, while another reports “terrible compatibility” across a wide range of games.

With Sunday’s announcement, GameSir promises a similar opportunity to “unlock your entire Steam library” and “run Win games/Steam natively” on Mac will be “coming soon.” GameSir is also promising “proprietary AI frame interpolation” for the Mac, following the recent rollout of a “native rendering mode” that improved frame rates on the Android version.

In a recent interview with The Memory Core newsletter, GameSir admitted that its primary motivation for releasing a Windows emulation tool was to sell more of its controllers. But GameSir’s controllers aren’t required to use the Android version, which it says was sideloaded on 5 million (primarily Chinese) Android devices even before its official Google Play release in November.

GameHub on Android has also faced controversy for including a number of invasive trackers (which are removed in a community-built Lite version). A GameSir representative told The Memory Core that this was just standard practice in the Chinese market, where there is less sensitivity to such user tracking, and that it has since been removed.

The representative also addressed concerns about reusing open source compatibility code in that interview, saying that its Windows emulator was “developed in-house by GameSir’s core engineering team” with its “own in-house compatibility layer (such as syscall hooks, GameScopeVK, and other technologies), rather than modifications to Wine’s core code.” That said, the representative admitted GameFusion “reference[s] and use UI components from Winlator [an open source Windows emulation tool for Android]… to maintain ecosystem compatibility and familiarity.”

The compatibility issues and controversial corporate entity involved here probably mean that GameHub for Mac won’t be the Valve SteamOS/Proton moment that Apple gamers have been waiting for. Still, it’ll be nice for MacBook owners to have yet another option to play Windows games without needing to run a Windows install.</div>

            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-02-17</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2026/02/password-managers-promise-that-they-cant-see-your-vaults-isnt-always-true/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Over the past 15 years, password managers have grown from a niche security tool used by the technology savvy into an indispensable security tool for the masses, with an estimated 94 million US adults—or roughly 36 percent of them—having adopted them. They store not only passwords for pension, financial, and email accounts, but also cryptocurrency credentials, payment card numbers, and other sensitive data.

All eight of the top password managers have adopted the term “zero knowledge” to describe the complex encryption system they use to protect the data vaults that users store on their servers. The definitions vary slightly from vendor to vendor, but they generally boil down to one bold assurance: that there is no way for malicious insiders or hackers who manage to compromise the cloud infrastructure to steal vaults or data stored in them. These promises make sense, given previous breaches of LastPass and the reasonable expectation that state-level hackers have both the motive and capability to obtain password vaults belonging to high-value targets.

Typical of these claims are those made by Bitwarden, Dashlane, and LastPass, which together are used by roughly 60 million people. Bitwarden, for example, says that “not even the team at Bitwarden can read your data (even if we wanted to).” Dashlane, meanwhile, says that without a user’s master password, “malicious actors can’t steal the information, even if Dashlane’s servers are compromised.” LastPass says that no one can access the “data stored in your LastPass vault, except you (not even LastPass).”

New research shows that these claims aren’t true in all cases, particularly when account recovery is in place or password managers are set to share vaults or organize users into groups. The researchers reverse-engineered or closely analyzed Bitwarden, Dashlane, and LastPass and identified ways that someone with control over the server—either administrative or the result of a compromise—can, in fact, steal data and, in some cases, entire vaults. The researchers also devised other attacks that can weaken the encryption to the point that ciphertext can be converted to plaintext.

“The vulnerabilities that we describe are numerous but mostly not deep in a technical sense,” the researchers from ETH Zurich and USI Lugano wrote. “Yet they were apparently not found before, despite more than a decade of academic research on password managers and the existence of multiple audits of the three products we studied. This motivates further work, both in theory and in practice.”

The researchers said in interviews that multiple other password managers they didn’t analyze as closely likely suffer from the same flaws. The only one they were at liberty to name was 1Password. Almost all the password managers, they added, are vulnerable to the attacks only when certain features are enabled.

The most severe of the attacks—targeting Bitwarden and LastPass—allow an insider or attacker to read or write to the contents of entire vaults. In some cases, they exploit weaknesses in the key escrow mechanisms that allow users to regain access to their accounts when they lose their master password. Others exploit weaknesses in support for legacy versions of the password manager. A vault-theft attack against Dashlane allowed reading but not modification of vault items when they were shared with other users.

One of the attacks targeting Bitwarden key escrow is performed during the enrollment of a new member of a family or organization. After a Bitwarden group admin invites the new member, the invitee’s client accesses a server and obtains a group symmetric key and the group’s public key. The client then encrypts the symmetric key with the group public key and sends it to the server. The resulting ciphertext is what’s used to recover the new user’s account. This data is never integrity-checked when it’s sent from the server to the client during an account enrollment session.

The adversary can exploit this weakness by replacing the group public key with one from a keypair created by the adversary. Since the adversary knows the corresponding private key, it can use it to decrypt the ciphertext and then perform an account recovery on behalf of the targeted user. The result is that the adversary can read and modify the entire contents of the member vault as soon as an invitee accepts an invitation from a family or organization.

Normally, this attack would work only when a group admin has enabled autorecovery mode, which, unlike a manual option, doesn’t require interaction from the member. But since the group policy the client downloads during the enrollment policy isn’t integrity-checked, adversaries can set recovery to auto, even if an admin had chosen a manual mode that requires user interaction.

Compounding the severity, the adversary in this attack also obtains a group symmetric key for all other groups the member belongs to since such keys are known to all group members. If any of the additional groups use account recovery, the adversary can obtain the members’ vaults for them, too. “This process can be repeated in a worm-like fashion, infecting all organizations that have key recovery enabled and have overlapping members,” the research paper explained.

A second attack targeting Bitwarden account recovery can be performed when a user rotates vault keys, an option Bitwarden recommends if a user believes their master password has been compromised. When account recovery is on (either manually or automatically), the user client regenerates the recovery ciphertext, which as described earlier involves obtaining a new public key that’s encrypted with the organization public key. The researchers denoted the group public key as pkorg. They denote the public key supplied by the adversary as pkadvorg, the recovery ciphertext as crec, and the user symmetric key as k′.

The key point here is that pkorg is not retrieved from the user’s vault; rather the client performs a sync operation with the server to obtain it. Crucially, the organization data provided by this sync operation is not authenticated in any way. This thus provides the adversary with another opportunity to obtain a victim’s user key, by supplying a new public key pkadvorg, for which they know the skadvorg and setting the account recovery enrollment to true. The client will then send an account recovery ciphertext crec containing the new user key, which the adversary can decrypt to obtain k′.

The third attack on the Bitwarden account recovery allows an adversary to recover a user’s master key. It abuses key connector, a feature primarily used by enterprise customers.

The attack allowing theft of LastPass vaults also targets key escrow, specifically in the Teams and Teams 5 versions, when a member’s master key is reset by a privileged user known as a superadmin. The next time the member logs in through the LastPass browser extension, their client will retrieve an RSA keypair assigned to each superadmin in the organization, encrypt their new key with each one, and send the resulting ciphertext to each superadmin.

Because LastPass also fails to authenticate the superadmin keys, an adversary can once again replace the superadmin public key (pkadm) with their own public key (pkadvadm).

“In theory, only users in teams where password reset is enabled and who are selected for reset should be affected by this vulnerability,” the researchers wrote. “In practice, however, LastPass clients query the server at each login and fetch a list of admin keys. They then send the account recovery ciphertexts independently of enrollment status.” The attack, however, requires the user to log in to LastPass with the browser extension, not the standalone client app.

Several attacks allow reading and modification of shared vaults, which allow a user to share selected items with one or more other users. When Dashlane users share an item, their client apps sample a fresh symmetric key, which either directly encrypts the shared item or, when sharing with a group, encrypts group keys, which in turn encrypt the shared item. In either case, the newly created RSA keypair(s)—belonging to either the shared user or group—isn’t authenticated. The item is then encrypted with the private key(s).

An adversary can supply their own key pair and use the public key to encrypt the ciphertext sent to the recipients. The adversary then decrypts that ciphertext with their corresponding secret key to recover the shared symmetric key. With that, the adversary can read and modify all shared items. When sharing is used in either Bitwarden or LastPass, similar attacks are possible and lead to the same consequence.

Another avenue for attackers or adversaries with control of a server is to target the backward compatibility that all three password managers provide to support older, less-secure versions. Despite incremental changes designed to harden the apps against the very attacks described in the paper, all three password managers continue to support the versions without these improvements. This backward compatibility is a deliberate decision intended to prevent users who haven’t upgraded from losing access to their vaults.

The severity of these attacks is lower than that of the previous ones described, with the exception of one, which is possible against Bitwarden. Older versions of the password manager used a single symmetric key to encrypt and decrypt the user key from the server and items inside vaults. This design allowed for the possibility that an adversary could tamper with the contents. To add integrity checks, newer versions provide authenticated encryption by augmenting the symmetric key with an HMAC hash function.

To protect customers using older app versions, Bitwarden ciphertext has an attribute of either 0 or 1. A 0 designates authenticated encryption, while a 1 supports the older unauthenticated scheme. Older versions also use a key hierarchy that Bitwarden deprecated to harden the app. To support the old hierarchy, newer client versions generate a new RSA keypair for the user if the server doesn’t provide one. The newer version will proceed to encrypt the secret key portion with the master key if no user ciphertext is provided by the server.

This design opens Bitwarden to several attacks. The most severe, allowing reading (but not modification) of all items created after the attack is performed. At a simplified level, it works because the adversary can forge the ciphertext sent by the server and cause the client to use it to derive a user key known to the adversary.

The modification causes the use of CBC (cipher block chaining), a form of encryption that’s vulnerable to several attacks. An adversary can exploit this weaker form using a padding oracle attack and go on to retrieve the plaintext of the vault. Because HMAC protection remains intact, modification isn’t possible.

Surprisingly, Dashlane was vulnerable to a similar padding oracle attack. The researchers devised a complicated attack chain that would allow a malicious server to downgrade a Dashlane user’s vault to CBC and exfiltrate the contents. The researchers estimate that the attack would require about 125 days to decrypt the ciphertext.

Still other attacks against all three password managers allow adversaries to greatly reduce the selected number of hashing iterations—in the case of Bitwarden and LastPass, from a default of 600,000 to 2. Repeated hashing of master passwords makes them significantly harder to crack in the event of a server breach that allows theft of the hash. For all three password managers, the server sends the specified iteration count to the client, with no mechanism to ensure it meets the default number. The result is that the adversary receives a 300,000-fold decrease in the time and resources required to crack the hash and obtain the user’s master password.

Three of the attacks—one against Bitwarden and two against LastPass—target what the researchers call “item-level encryption” or “vault malleability.” Instead of encrypting a vault in a single, monolithic blob, password managers often encrypt individual items, and sometimes individual fields within an item. These items and fields are all encrypted with the same key. The attacks exploit this design to steal passwords from select vault items.

An adversary mounts an attack by replacing the ciphertext in the URL field, which stores the link where a login occurs, with the ciphertext for the password. To enhance usability, password managers provide an icon that helps visually recognize the site. To do this, the client decrypts the URL field and sends it to the server. The server then fetches the corresponding icon. Because there’s no mechanism to prevent the swapping of item fields, the client decrypts the password instead of the URL and sends it to the server.

“That wouldn’t happen if you had different keys for different fields or if you encrypted the entire collection in one pass,” Kenny Paterson, one of the paper co-authors, said. “A crypto audit should spot it, but only if you’re thinking about malicious servers. The server is deviating from expected behavior.

The following table summarizes the causes and consequences of the 25 attacks they devised:

The researchers acknowledge that the full compromise of a password manager server is a high bar. But they defend the threat model.

“Attacks on the provider server infrastructure can be prevented by carefully designed operational security measures, but it is well within the bounds of reason to assume that these services are targeted by sophisticated nation-state-level adversaries, for example via software supply-chain attacks or spearphishing,” they wrote. “Moreover, some of the service providers have a history of being breached—for example, LassPass suffered breaches in 2015 and 2022, and another serious security incident in 2021.

They went on to write: “While none of the breaches we are aware of involved reprogramming the server to make it undertake malicious actions, this goes just one step beyond attacks on password manager service providers that have been documented. Active attacks more broadly have been documented in the wild.”

Part of the challenge of designing password managers or any end-to-end encryption service is the tendency for a false sense of security of the client.

“It’s a psychological problem when you’re writing both client and server software,” Paterson explained. “You should write the client super defensively, but if you’re also writing the server, well of course your server isn’t going to send malformed packets or bad info. Why would you do that?”

In many of the cases, engineers have already fixed the weaknesses described after receiving private reports from the researchers. Engineers are still patching other vulnerabilities. In statements, Bitwarden, Lastpass, and Dashlane representatives noted the high bar of the threat model, despite statements on their websites that assure customers their wares will withstand it. Along with 1Password representatives, they also noted that their products regularly receive stringent security audits and undergo red-team exercises.

Bitwarden continually evaluates and improves its software through internal review, third-party assessments, and external research. The ETH Zurich paper analyzes a threat model in which the server itself behaves maliciously and intentionally attempts to manipulate key material and configuration values. That model assumes full server compromise and adversarial behavior beyond standard operating assumptions for cloud services.

LastPass said, “We take a multi‑layered, ongoing approach to security assurance that combines independent oversight, continuous monitoring, and collaboration with the research community. Our cloud security testing is inclusive of the scenarios referenced in the malicious-server threat model outlined in the research.”

A statement from Dashlane read, “Dashlane conducts rigorous internal and external testing to ensure the security of our product. When issues arise, we work quickly to mitigate any possible risk and ensure customers have clarity on the problem, our solution, and any required actions.”

1Password released a statement that read in part:

Our security team reviewed the paper in depth and found no new attack vectors beyond those already documented in our publicly available Security Design White Paper.

We are committed to continually strengthening our security architecture and evaluating it against advanced threat models, including malicious-server scenarios like those described in the research, and evolving it over time to maintain the protections our users rely on.

1Password also says that the zero-knowledge encryption it provides “means that no one but you—not even the company that’s storing the data—can access and decrypt your data. This protects your information even if the server where it’s held is ever breached.” In the company’s white paper linked above, 1Password seems to allow for this possibility when it says:

At present there’s no practical method for a user to verify the public key they’re encrypting data to belongs to their intended recipient. As a consequence it would be possible for a malicious or compromised 1Password server to provide dishonest public keys to the user, and run a successful attack. Under such an attack, it would be possible for the 1Password server to acquire vault encryption keys with little ability for users to detect or prevent it.

1Password’s statement also includes assurances that the service routinely undergoes rigorous security testing.

All four companies defended their use of the term “zero knowledge.” As used in this context, the term can be confused with zero-knowledge proofs, a completely unrelated cryptographic method that allows one party to prove to another party that they know a piece of information without revealing anything about the information itself. An example is a proof that shows a system can determine if someone is over 18 without having any knowledge of the precise birthdate.

The adulterated zero-knowledge term used by password managers appears to have come into being in 2007, when a company called SpiderOak used it to describe its cloud infrastructure for securely sharing sensitive data. Interestingly, SpiderOak formally retired the term a decade later after receiving user pushback.

“Sadly, it is just marketing hype, much like ‘military-grade encryption,’” Matteo Scarlata, lead author of the paper, said. “Zero-knowledge seems to mean different things to different people (e.g., LastPass told us that they won’t adopt a malicious server threat model internally). Much unlike ‘end-to-end encryption,’ ‘zero-knowledge encryption’ is an elusive goal, so it’s impossible to tell if a company is doing it right.”</div>

            <h2>Stephen Colbert says CBS forbid interview of Democrat because of FCC threat</h2>
            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-02-17</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2026/02/stephen-colbert-says-cbs-forbid-interview-of-democrat-because-of-fcc-threat/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Talk show host Stephen Colbert said CBS forbade him from interviewing Texas Democratic Senate candidate James Talarico because of a Federal Communications Commission threat to enforce the equal-time rule on late-night and daytime talk shows.

Talarico “was supposed to be here, but we were told in no uncertain terms by our network’s lawyers, who called us directly, that we could not have him on the broadcast,” Colbert said on last night’s episode of The Late Show with Stephen Colbert. “Then I was told in some uncertain terms that not only could I not have him on, I could not mention me not having him on, and because my network clearly doesn’t want us to talk about this, let’s talk about this.”

Colbert went on to describe some of the background Ars readers are already familiar with. FCC Chairman Brendan Carr recently issued a warning to late-night and daytime talk shows that they may no longer qualify for the bona fide news exemption to the equal-time rule, and subsequently opened an investigation into ABC’s The View after an interview with Talarico.

Formally known as the Equal Opportunities Rule, the rule generally requires that stations giving time to one political candidate provide comparable time and placement to opposing candidates if any opposing candidate makes a request. The rule has an exemption for candidate appearances on bona fide news programs, and entertainment talk shows have generally been treated as bona fide news programs for this purpose.

The equal-time rule is “the FCC’s most time-honored rule, right after ‘no nipples at the Super Bowl,’” Colbert said. Carr’s recent letter “said he was thinking about dropping the exception for talk shows because he said some of them were motivated by partisan purposes,” Colbert said, while accusing Carr of being motivated by partisan purposes himself.

“Let’s just call this what it is: Donald Trump’s administration wants to silence anyone who says anything bad about Trump on TV because all Trump does is watch TV. He’s like a toddler with too much screen time,” Colbert said. Colbert also said he’s not allowed to show a photo of Talarico, but simultaneously showed a photo of the candidate.

We contacted CBS and its owner Paramount today and have not received a response. CBS denied prohibiting an interview with Talarico in a statement reported by Variety. The CBS statement acknowledged giving “legal guidance” about potential consequences under the equal-time rule, though.

“The Late Show was not prohibited by CBS from broadcasting the interview with Rep. James Talarico,” the statement said. “The show was provided legal guidance that the broadcast could trigger the FCC equal-time rule for two other candidates, including Rep. Jasmine Crockett, and presented options for how the equal time for other candidates could be fulfilled. The Late Show decided to present the interview through its YouTube channel with on-air promotion on the broadcast rather than potentially providing the equal-time options.”

Colbert played audio of a recent Carr interview in which the FCC chairman said, “If [Jimmy] Kimmel and Colbert want to continue to do their programming, they don’t want to have to comply with this requirement, then they can go to a cable channel or a podcast or a streaming service and that’s fine.”

Colbert said he “decided to take Brendan Carr’s advice” and interviewed Talarico for a segment posted on his show’s YouTube channel. “The network says I can’t give you a URL or a QR code but I promise you if you go to our YouTube page, you’ll find it,” Colbert said. That interview is available here.

Colbert described the unequal treatment of late-night talk shows and talk radio. “Carr here claims he’s just getting partisanship off the airwaves but the FCC is also in charge of regulating radio broadcasts. And what would you know, Brendan Carr says right-wing talk radio isn’t a target of the FCC’s equal time notice,” Colbert said.

Colbert said that a mere threat, and not an actual rule change, caused CBS to forbid him from interviewing a candidate. “At this point, he’s just released a letter that says he’s thinking about doing away with the exception for late night, he hasn’t done away with it yet,” Colbert said. “But my network is unilaterally enforcing it as if he had. But I want to assure you this decision is for purely financial reasons.”

Colbert’s tenure as host is scheduled to end in May. CBS announced it would end the show last year after Colbert called CBS owner Paramount’s $16 million settlement with Trump “a big fat bribe.” Paramount subsequently won FCC approval of an $8 billion merger with Skydance, while agreeing to Carr’s demand to install a “bias monitor.”

FCC Democrat Anna Gomez said today that CBS forbidding the interview with Talarico “is yet another troubling example of corporate capitulation in the face of this administration’s broader campaign to censor and control speech. The FCC has no lawful authority to pressure broadcasters for political purposes or to create a climate that chills free expression. CBS is fully protected under the First Amendment to determine what interviews it airs, which makes its decision to yield to political pressure all the more disappointing.”

Gomez said Paramount “has regulatory matters before the government, but corporate interests cannot justify retreating from airing newsworthy content.” She urged broadcasters “to stand firm against these unlawful pressures and continue exercising their constitutional right to speak freely and without government interference.”

Harold Feld, a longtime telecom attorney who is senior VP of consumer advocacy group Public Knowledge, said today that “if what Colbert says is true, CBS needs new lawyers. Even the strictest reading of the equal time rule doesn’t prevent someone from saying the name of a candidate or talking about a URL. Even if the rule applied, CBS would not be required to offer an equal opportunity to Republican candidates at this time. Because Rep. Talarico is still a candidate in the primary, only his two primary opponents—Rep. Jasmine Crocket (D-Texas) and Ahmad Hassan—are entitled to equal opportunity. Nor did CBS have any responsibility to offer equal time to them; candidates must make a request on their own.”

Feld called the incident “disgraceful behavior by both CBS and the chairman of the FCC.” With the FCC targeting late-night TV but not talk radio, Feld said it appears that “broadcast appearances by Trump-friendly candidates will continue to receive exemptions from this rule while appearances by Trump-disapproved candidates will not.” Paramount’s capitulation seems to be more about “finding an excuse to curry favor with President Trump, rather than any concern over the equal time rule,” he said.

The Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression (FIRE) said that “candidate interviews have long been exempt from ‘equal time’ rules for good reason. It would be wrong if a Democratic administration demanded conservative talk radio hosts give equal airtime when they interview candidates, and it’s wrong for the Trump administration to demand the same of late night talk show hosts.”

FIRE Chief Counsel Robert Corn-Revere said that by “putting pressure on late night talk shows critical of the Trump administration while openly admitting that conservative talk radio is immune from the FCC’s ire,” Carr is “making himself the poster boy for big government putting its thumb on the scale of political debate.”

            <h2>Most VMware users still "actively reducing their VMware footprint," survey finds</h2>
            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-02-17</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2026/02/most-vmware-users-still-actively-reducing-their-vmware-footprint-survey-finds/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">More than two years after Broadcom took over VMware, the virtualization company’s customers are still grappling with higher prices, uncertainty, and the challenges of reducing vendor lock-in.

Today, CloudBolt Software released a report, “The Mass Exodus That Never Was: The Squeeze Is Just Beginning,” that provides insight into those struggles. CloudBolt is a hybrid cloud management platform provider that aims to identify VMware customers’ pain points so it can sell them relevant solutions. In the report, CloudBolt said it surveyed 302 IT decision-makers (director-level or higher) at North American companies with at least 1,000 employees in January. The survey is far from comprehensive, but it offers a look at the obstacles these users face.

Broadcom closed its VMware acquisition in November 2023, and last month, 88 percent of survey respondents still described the change as “disruptive.” Per the survey, the most cited drivers of disruption were price increases (named by 89 percent of respondents), followed by uncertainty about Broadcom’s plans (85 percent), support quality concerns (78 percent), Broadcom shifting VMware from perpetual licenses to subscriptions (72 percent), changes to VMware’s partner program (68 percent), and the forced bundling of products (65 percent).

When Broadcom bought VMware, some customers shared horror stories about receiving quotes that showed prices increasing by as much as 1,000 percent. CloudBolt’s survey paints a more modest picture. Fourteen percent of respondents said their VMware costs have at least doubled, while 12 percent reported increases of 50–99 percent, 33 percent reported increases of 24–49 percent, and 31 percent reported increases of less than 25 percent.

Despite survey participants suggesting smaller price hikes than originally anticipated under Broadcom, companies are still struggling with the pricing changes. Eighty-five percent are concerned that VMware will become even more expensive, according to CloudBolt’s survey.

Broadcom introduced changes to VMware that are especially unfriendly to small- and-medium-sized businesses (SMBs), and Gartner previously predicted that 35 percent of VMware workloads would migrate else by 2028.

CloudBolt’s survey also examined how respondents are migrating workloads off of VMware. Currently, 36 percent of participants said they migrated 1–24 percent of their environment off of VMware. Another 32 percent said that they have migrated 25–49 percent; 10 percent said that they’ve migrated 50–74 percent of workloads; and 2 percent have migrated 75 percent or more of workloads. Five percent of respondents said that they have not migrated from VMware at all.

Among migrated workloads, 72 percent moved to public cloud infrastructure as a service, followed by Microsoft’s Hyper-V/Azure stack (43 percent of respondents).

Overall, 86 percent of respondents “are actively reducing their VMware footprint,” CloudBolt’s report said.

“The fear has cooled, but the pressure hasn’t—and most teams are now making practical moves to build leverage and optionality—even if for some that includes the realization that a portion of their estate never moves off VMware,” Mark Zembal, CloudBolt’s chief marketing officer, said in a statement.

While bundled products, fewer options, resellers, and higher prices make VMware harder to justify for many, especially SMB customers, migration is a long process with its own costs, including time spent researching alternatives and building relevant skills. CloudBolt’s reported multi-platform complexity (52 percent) and skills gaps (33 percent) topped the list of migration challenges.

“As organizations diversify away from VMware, they inherit the operational burden of managing multiple platforms with different operational and governance models,” the report reads.

While companies determine the best ways to limit their dependence on VMware, Broadcom can still make money from smaller customers it doesn’t deem necessary for the long term.

“Their strategy was never to keep every customer,” CloudBolt’s report says. “It was to maximize value from those still on the platform while the market slowly diversifies. The model assumes churn and it’s built to make the economics work anyway. Broadcom has done the math—and they’re fine with it.”</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Imagine turning the key or pressing the start button of your car—and nothing happens. Not because the battery is dead or the engine is broken but because a server no longer answers. For a growing number of cars, that scenario isn’t hypothetical.

As vehicles become platforms for software and subscriptions, their longevity is increasingly tied to the survival of the companies behind their code. When those companies fail, the consequences ripple far beyond a bad app update and into the basic question of whether a car still functions as a car.

Over the years, automotive software has expanded from performing rudimentary engine management and onboard diagnostics to powering today’s interconnected, software-defined vehicles. Smartphone apps can now handle tasks like unlocking doors, flashing headlights, and preconditioning cabins—and some models won’t unlock at all unless a phone running the manufacturer’s app is within range.

However, for all the promised convenience of modern vehicle software, there’s a growing nostalgia for an era when a phone call to a mechanic could resolve most problems. Mechanical failures were often diagnosable and fixable, and cars typically returned to the road quickly. Software-defined vehicles complicate that model: When something goes wrong, a car can be rendered inoperable in a driveway—or stranded at the side of the road—waiting not for parts but a software technician.

Take the example of Fisker. In May 2023, the California auto brand arrived in Britain with its Ocean Sport before filing for bankruptcy just one year later. Priced from £35,000 ($44,000)—although top-spec trims pushed the price to £60,000 ($75,000)—the all-electric Tesla Model Y rival featured tech including a partially retracting roof and a rotating BYD-like touchscreen. All cars also carried a six-year/62,000-mile (99,779 km) warranty, with the battery and powertrain covered for 10 years or 100,000 miles (160,934 km).

Before Fisker’s 2024 bankruptcy, just 419 Fisker Oceans made it into British driveways. One unfortunate buyer, a marketing manager from Southampton, experienced the worst of the brand’s teething troubles. After taking delivery, her Ocean was plagued by persistent software glitches. Following a call to Fisker, engineers were dispatched to collect the vehicle for repairs, but when the car was due to be collected, it refused to start. Mere days later, Fisker declared insolvency, leaving the Ocean stranded as a 5,500 lb (2,500 kg) driveway ornament for the next ten months with no solution in sight.

Preceding Fisker, there was Better Place. Founded in 2007, Better Place wasn’t a car manufacturer but an EV infrastructure and software company that promised to solve range anxiety through battery-swap stations. Its entire model relied on centralized servers, subscriptions, and proprietary software to authenticate vehicles and manage battery exchanges. The flagship car for this system was the Renault Fluence Z.E., an electric sedan sold primarily in Israel and Denmark.

Better Place filed for bankruptcy in May 2013 after burning through $850 million, leading to Renault closing the Fluence Z.E’s Turkish assembly line. Servers were shut down, battery-swap stations stopped operating, and backend software used for authentication, charging, and fleet management disappeared, leaving many cars bricked.

These cases highlight a broader shift in the auto industry, where long-term ownership is increasingly dependent not just on mechanical durability but on continued access to proprietary software and manufacturer support.

“When a modern car’s software misbehaves, you don’t fix it yourself—you call the manufacturer,” said Stuart Masson, founder and editor of The Car Expert. “They control the code. At that point, you’re not dealing with a traditional service department so much as an IT help desk.”

That dependence, Masson warned, becomes a critical failure mode when the manufacturer disappears. “Sooner or later, every owner risks a Fisker-style scenario, where the company is gone and there’s nothing you can do about it.”

While informal owner communities have begun attempting to reverse-engineer and distribute unofficial software updates, Masson is blunt about the risks. “You’re trusting that someone on the Internet actually knows what they’re doing,” he said. “If they don’t, the consequences might not be that Android Auto simply stops working but instead an airbag deploying at 70 mph.”

While buying a second-hand Fisker in the UK is a high-risk move, more established manufacturers generally have contingency plans if a critical software partner goes under. In practice, that usually means issuing recalls or pushing over-the-air fixes to affected vehicles. Warranty coverage should handle most issues for newer cars, but the story gets murkier on the used market.

Take a decade-old Tesla Model S, for example: You might snag one at a bargain price, but there’s no guarantee Tesla will continue supporting it indefinitely. When a manufacturer drops software support, the car isn’t just at risk of breaking down—it becomes a potential cybersecurity liability. In a world where vehicles are increasingly defined by their code, running unsupported software is akin to leaving your router exposed to the Internet. You may have a functioning car today, but there’s no telling when—or how—it could stop running.

“Many teams, such as McLaren, who have F1 cars from the 1990s, require a 1990s-era laptop running an old Windows operating system, along with specialized interface hardware, for maintenance and to start the car,” Masson said. “We are up against time here, but it could be that brands like Tesla release its code, allowing people to use it. Who knows?”

The problem isn’t solely on the consumer; manufacturers shoulder a significant portion of the risk as well. One potential mitigation is standardization. Enter Catena-X, a collaborative data network connecting OEMs, suppliers, and IT vendors. By creating traceable digital records for parts and software—and standardizing data models and APIs for interoperability—Catena-X aims to make supply chains more resilient and software dependencies less catastrophic when a critical partner disappears.

When asked how OEMs can map software dependencies and mitigate vendor insolvency, Catena-X Managing Director Hanno Focken told Ars that “Catena-X supports software bills of materials and standardizes certain components to make software replaceable, plus a marketplace and open-source reference implementation helps OEMs find alternative vendors.”

The industry also shares responsibility in defining minimum operational lifespans for vehicle software. “As an association, Catena-X can facilitate shared industry commitments and consensus (e.g., data retention policies like a 10-year battery passport requirement), but it does not act as a regulator setting mandatory lifespans,” added Focken.

The lesson is clear: In today’s cars, the engine or electric motor isn’t always what keeps you moving—the software does. When that software vanishes with a bankrupt company, your car can go from daily driver to expensive paperweight overnight. And in the age of software-defined vehicles, owning a car increasingly means betting on the survival of its code. When that code dies, the driveway or highway—not the repair shop—becomes the final stop.</div>

            <h2>RAM shortage hits Valve's four-year-old Steam Deck, now available "intermittently"</h2>
            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-02-17</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2026/02/valves-steam-deck-intermittently-out-of-stock-as-ram-shortage-drags-on/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Earlier this month, Valve announced it was delaying the release of its new Steam Machine desktop and Steam Frame VR headset due to memory and storage shortages that have been cascading across the PC industry since late 2025. But those shortages are also coming for products that have already launched.

Valve had added a note to its Steam Deck page noting that the device would be “out-of-stock intermittently in some regions due to memory and storage shortages.” None of Valve’s three listed Steam Deck configurations are currently available to buy, nor are any of the certified refurbished Steam Deck configurations that Valve sometimes offers.

Valve hasn’t announced any price increases for the Deck, at least not yet—the 512GB OLED model is still listed at $549 and the 1TB version at $649. But the basic 256GB LCD model has been formally discontinued now that it has sold out, increasing the Deck’s de facto starting price from $399 to $549. Valve announced in December that it was ending production on the LCD version of the Deck and that it wouldn’t be restocked once it sold out.

The Steam Deck’s hardware is four years old this month, and faster hardware with better chips and higher-resolution screens have been released in the years since. But those Ryzen Z1 and Z2 chips aren’t always dramatically faster than the Deck’s semi-custom AMD chip; many of those handhelds are also considerably more expensive than the OLED Deck’s $549 starting price. When it’s in stock, the Deck still offers compelling performance and specs for the price.

Shortages of RAM and flash memory chips—caused mostly by the AI industry’s staggering demand for those components and widely expected to last through 2026 and beyond—have come at an especially bad time for Valve. The Steam Deck has helped make a small dent in Windows’ dominance on gaming PCs thanks to the Proton translation technology that allows unmodified Windows games to run on the Linux-based SteamOS. The company’s efforts to build on that success with the Steam Machine and the Steam Frame were paused by memory and storage shortages, and now people who want to buy a Steam Deck may end up turning to an alternative Windows-based handheld instead.

If you want a handheld that runs SteamOS, Lenovo’s Legion Go S is the one third-party handheld that ships with the operating system these days. But adventurous buyers can try SteamOS on any AMD-based handheld. Valve offers beta support for the Legion Go (without an S), the Asus ROG Ally, and the Asus ROG Ally X, and we’ve had success installing the operating system on a wide range of AMD-based laptop and desktop PCs. People who don’t want to wait for the Steam Machine can also try building their own—I’ve done it with good results so far. But you’ll want an AMD Ryzen CPU and Radeon GPU for the best results, and recent Ars testing has found that GPUs with just 8GB of video memory may struggle to run games as well as they run in Windows.</div>

            <h2>AI Data Centers Are Now Spiking Hard Drive Prices</h2>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Over the last couple of months, the AI industry’s obsession with building out costly data centers has sent the price of RAM skyrocketing, turning a simple computer upgrade into a costly investment.

And while there are some early glimmers of hope, with RAM prices now falling across the pond, the next AI price hike could affect a different component instead: hard drives.

During a recent company earnings call, Irving Tan, the CEO of hard drive manufacturer Western Digital, admitted that “we’re pretty much sold out for calendar 2026.”

As PCWorld explains, Tan was referring to the company’s production capacity as part of an effort to allocate its available inventory to its customers.

While Western Digital hard drives will remain on the shelves for now, prices could soon follow the footsteps of RAM and graphical processing units as the hype surrounding generative AI continues to dominate markets — and terrify investors.

“As AI capabilities expand, cloud continues to grow as well, and both are driving the search and demand for higher density storage solutions,” Tan told investors. “In this new era where AI and cloud dominate, Western Digital has taken a customer-focused approach to managing this strong demand by working closely with our hyperscale customers, ensuring that we deliver reliable, high-capacity drives at scale to give them the best performance and total cost of ownership.”

The sales figures tell a clear story: just under 90 percent of the company’s revenue comes from cloud storage. The hyperscalers Tan was referring to are the cloud computing and data management services that need access to enormous data centers for both data processing and storage.

The enormous demand from AI industry players has already hit the hard drive market hard. In November, Tom’s Hardware reported that hard drives were on backorder for two years following major investments in AI data centers.

Tan’s comments will likely do little to reassure consumers. Between September and January, average hard drive prices had already surged by a whopping 46 percent.

            <h2>It Turns Out That Constantly Telling Workers They’re About to Be Replaced by AI Has Grim Psychological Effects</h2>
            <p><strong>Futurism | 2026-02-17</strong></p>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Two researchers are warning of the devastating psychological impacts that AI automation, or the threat of it, can have on the workforce. The phenomenon, they argue in a new article published in the journal Cureus, warrants a new term: AI replacement dysfunction (AIRD).

The constant fear of losing your job could be driving symptoms ranging from anxiety, insomnia, paranoia, and loss of identity, according to the authors, which can manifest even in absence of other psychiatric disorders or other factors like substance abuse.

“AI displacement is an invisible disaster,” co-lead author Joseph Thornton, a clinical associate professor of psychiatry at the University of Florida, said in a statement about the work. “As with other disasters that affect mental health, effective responses must extend beyond the clinician’s office to include community support and collaborative partnerships that foster recovery.”

Most of the attention on AI’s mental health impacts has centered on the effects of personally using the tech, with widespread reports of AI pulling users into psychotic episodes or encouraging dangerous behavior. But the stress that arises from the widespread fears surrounding the tech might deserve a closer look in a clinical context, too.

Job destruction is probably one of the biggest fears. A Reuters survey found that 71 percent of Americans are worried that AI could permanently put vast swaths of people out of work. The narrative is pushed by top figures in the industry. Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei, for example, infamously warned that AI could wipe out half of all entry-level white collar jobs. Microsoft’s AI CEO Mustafa Suleyman added last week that AI could automate “most, if not all” white collar tasks within a year and a half.

There’re plenty of reasons to question these claims, but some number of AI-related layoffs are already happening. Amazon is in the middle of sacking 14,000 employees after boasting of the “efficiency gains” from using AI across the company. And one report found that AI was cited in the announcements of more than 54,000 layoffs last year.

Enter AIRD. In the paper, the authors cite one study that showed a positive correlation between AI implementation in the workplace and anxiety and depression. Another cited study found that stress and other negative emotions are common for professionals in fields that are considered susceptible to AI automation.

Co-lead author Stephanie McNamara, a psychology student at the University of Florida, said she coined the dysfunction after noticing a rise in AI-induced layoffs last year. “It made me think about the mental health impacts it is going to have on society,” she said in the statement.

According to the authors, AIRD will present uniquely for each sufferer, but will generally revolve around a cluster of symptoms including professional identity loss and loss of purpose. Some patients may even be in denial of AI’s relevance as a “defense mechanism,” they wrote. These may initially be foreshadowed with complaints related to insomnia and stress. The distress will not be “rooted in traditional psychopathology,” the authors add, “but in the existential threat of professional obsolescence.”

AIRD is not a clinically recognized diagnosis yet, the authors stress. But they propose a method for screening for the disorder through a careful progression of open-ended questions that should eliminate other causes like substance abuse. It’s important to recognize these as uniquely stemming from AI-related anxieties, they argue, because with the tech’s rise, more clinicians will encounter patients whose symptoms don’t arise from primary psychiatric disorders.

“Equipping mental health professionals with the knowledge and tools to recognize and treat people with AIRD will be vital for societal acceptance of a condition that will increasingly affect the workplace,” the researchers wrote.

            <h2>Pentagon Issues Threat to Anthropic</h2>
            <p><strong>Futurism | 2026-02-17</strong></p>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Over the weekend, the Wall Street Journal reported that the US military had used Anthropic’s Claude AI chatbot for its invasion of Venezuela and kidnapping of the country’s president Nicolás Maduro.

The exact details of Claude’s use remain hazy, but the incident demonstrated the Pentagon’s prioritization of the use of AI, and how tools available to the public may already be involved in military operations. And when Anthropic learned about it, its response was icy.

An Anthropic spokesperson remained tight-lipped on whether “Claude, or any other AI model, was used for any specific operation, classified or otherwise” in a statement to the WSJ, but noted that “any use of Claude — whether in the private sector or across government — is required to comply with our Usage Policies, which govern how Claude can be deployed.”

The deployment reportedly occurred through the AI company’s partnership with the shadowy military contractor Palantir. Anthropic also signed an up to $200 million contract with the Pentagon last summer as part of the military’s broader adoption of the tech, alongside OpenAI’s ChatGPT, Google’s Gemini, and xAI’s Grok.

Whether the Pentagon’s use of Claude broke any of Anthropic’s rules remains unclear. Claude’s usage guidelines forbid it from being used to “facilitate or promote any act of violence,” “develop or design weapons,” or “surveillance.”

Either way, Trump administration officials are now considering cutting ties with Anthropic over the company’s insistence that mass surveillance of Americans and fully autonomous weaponry remain off limits, Axios reports.

“Everything’s on the table,” including a dialing back of the partnership, a senior administration official told Axios. “But there’ll have to be an orderly replacement [for] them, if we think that’s the right answer.”

As if that phrasing wasn’t strong enough, a senior official — it’s unclear if it’s the same one — followed up with an even more pugnacious remark.

“It will be an enormous pain in the ass to disentangle, and we are going to make sure they pay a price for forcing our hand like this,” they told the site.

Anthropic reportedly reached out to Palantir to figure out whether Claude was used during the attacks on Venezuela, according to Axios’ sourcing, in signs of a broader culture clash and growing concerns of the tech being implicated in military operations.

Late last month, Anthropic already clashed over the limits of its $200 million contract with the Pentagon, including how many law enforcement agencies, such as Immigration and Customs Enforcement and the Federal Bureau of Investigation, could deploy it, per prior reporting by the WSJ.

Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei has repeatedly warned of the inherent risks of the tech his company is working on, calling for more government oversight, regulation, and guardrails. He has also raised concerns over AI being used by autonomous lethal operations and domestic surveillance.

In a lengthy essay posted earlier this year, Amodei argued that large-scale AI-facilitated surveillance should be considered a crime against humanity.

Meanwhile, defense secretary Pete Hegseth doesn’t appear to share these hangups. Earlier this year, he promised that the Pentagon wouldn’t “employ AI models that won’t allow you to fight wars,” a comment that sources told the WSJ concerned discussions with Anthropic.

Anthropic continues to insist that it’s “committed to using frontier AI in support of US national security” in a statement to both the WSJ and Axios.

However, its issues with the Pentagon appear to be going over well with its non-government users, who have been horrified by the tech being implicated in military action.

“Good job Anthropic, you just became the top closed [AI] company in my books,” one top post reads on the Claude subreddit.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">While humanoid robots have a long way to go to prove useful in our day-to-day lives, they’ve at least made leaps and bounds in showing off their agility on stage.

Case in point, the televised Spring Festival Gala put on by the state-run China Media Group over the weekend featured an impressive synchronized martial arts routine. Organizers were even confident enough to put the well-being of children on the line, having young performers spar with a small army of nunchuck- and spear-wielding Unitree G1 robots.

At one point, several of the robots can be seen performing a wall flip, an impressive feat that involves them literally running up a temporary wall on stage. (You can check it out for yourself at the 3:16 mark in the video embedded below.)

It’s a dazzling performance, showcasing how far the country’s robotics industry has come in a few short years, a massive surge in interest that has even led to the country’s regulators warning of an impending bubble as an influx of robotics companies risks crowding one another out.

Users on social media immediately noticed an enormous technological leap, comparing this year’s performance to a far less impressive appearance a mere year ago, which saw less sophisticated humanoid robots awkwardly shuffling on stage while waving red handkerchiefs.

“Humanoids ⁠bundle a ⁠lot of China’s strengths into one narrative: AI capability, ​hardware supply chain, and manufacturing ambition,” Beijing-based tech analyst Poe Zhao told Reuters of the performance. “They are also the most ‘legible’ form factor for the public and officials.”

Whether the rest of the world, including Elon Musk’s Tesla, which is developing its own Optimus robot, can keep up with China remains to be seen. For one, Optimus robots still heavily rely on human remote operators.

“By far, the biggest competition for humanoid robots will be from China,” Musk told investors during an earnings call earlier this year. “China is good at manufacturing, and also in AI, judging from open models.”

“To the best of my knowledge, we don’t see significant competition outside of China,” he added. “People outside of China underestimate China, but China’s an ass-kicker next-level.”

However, whether all of that martial arts expertise can be translated into actually-useful skills — arming robots with nunchucks isn’t exactly going to give China an edge on the battlefield, the workforce, or domestic labor — is still a wide-open question. Robotics companies are struggling to get their humanoid robots to adjust to the messy reality of daily life on the fly, and are only starting to make some progress.

In other words, while having robots sparring with children live on stage as part of a well-rehearsed choreography is unquestionably impressive, reliably doing chores around the house could prove far more difficult in the long run — even for China.

“Cool,” one Reddit user commented on the latest martial arts performance. “Can I please get one that just cleans my house and does the laundry?”

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Tesla CEO Elon Musk once boasted that the Cybertruck could double as a boat. Perhaps the AI behind his cars’ Full Self-Driving software took Musk at his word and hallucinated that this applied to all Teslas, because one of them just attempted to steer a guy’s ride straight into a lake.

Footage of this lacustrine impulse was shared Sunday by Daniel Milligan, a Tesla owner and former SpaceX engineer. It begins innocently enough: at night, on a quiet road. The car then gently turns right onto what turns out to be a boat ramp, and instead of slowing down, accelerates towards what would’ve been its watery grave, had the driver not hit the brakes.

“I had to intervene,” Milligan wrote. “I’d like to see what it would’ve done, but at the speed it was going, it definitely felt like it was going to go for a swim.”

Milligan explained his intended destination was a driveway about fifty feet away. He suspected the error had to do with the lighting conditions.

“Just tried it again during the day (same direction and destination) and it completely skipped the boat ramp,” Milligan later reported. “My guess is that it could actually see the driveway up ahead in the daytime or could more clearly see the lake.”

The footage is merely the latest among countless examples of self-driving cars struggling to safely, or evenly convincingly, navigate public roads. Tesla’s FSD in particular has generated loads of controversies, which is no doubt a consequence of Musk’s incredible decision to make it available to millions of Tesla owners, despite the software being both unfinished and not actually fully self-driving. While its name suggests otherwise, it is classified as a driving assistance feature, requiring drivers be prepared to intervene at any moment.

Its track record, therefore, is worrisome. On top of a documented habit of driving straight into the path of oncoming trains, FSD and its predecessor Autopilot have also been involved in numerous deadly accidents, including the latter being found partially responsible for the death of a 22-year-old woman who was struck by one of the cars.

These concerns rarely deter Tesla owners. Milligan, for example, still thinks FSD is a “game changer,” but admits it “needs more work before it’s fully autonomous.”

Of course, maybe we should consider that FSD has a daring sense of humor: it nearly re-enacted a famous scene from “The Office,” in which Michael Scott submerges his car after taking his GPS’s guidance too literally.

“The machine knows where it’s going. The machines knows!” he screams.

            <div id="article-text">What happens to social media accounts belonging to those who shuffle off this mortal coil has been a subject of debate ever since the tech went mainstream. Should dormant accounts be left alone, or should their surviving loved ones be given backdoor access to maintain them as digital memorials?

To Meta, there could be a morbid alternative: training an AI model on a deceased user’s posts, keeping post-mortem accounts active by uploading new content in their voice long after they passed away.

As Business Insider reports, Meta was granted a patent in 2023 for the idea, outlining how a large language model (LLM) can “simulate” a user’s social media activity.

“The language model may be used for simulating the user when the user is absent from the social networking system, for example, when the user takes a long break or if the user is deceased,” reads the goosebump-raising patent, which lists the company’s CTO Andrew Bosworth as the primary author.

However, the conversation appears to have dramatically shifted over the last three years, especially now that AI slop has infiltrated and practically assumed control over platforms like Facebook and Instagram: Meta now says it’s given up on the sepulchral concept.

“We have no plans to move forward with this example,” a spokesperson told BI.

We’ve already come across countless examples of using AI to emulate dead people, from a grandmother who was resurrected as an AI model for her funeral to “grief tech” startups aiming to let grieving loved ones train AI models on images, recordings, and footage of the deceased.

“The impact on the users is much more severe and permanent if that user is deceased and can never return to the social networking platform,” read the Meta patent.

A digital clone of the deceased person would have been able to interact with people through likes and comments — and even DMs — according to the patent.

While the company has since distanced itself from the grisly idea, the mere existence of the patent highlights how companies were — and in many ways, still are — throwing everything at the wall to discover new use cases for LLMs, and how far they’re willing to go.

Last year, for instance, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg even suggested that lonely users could make friends with the company’s bots instead of with living humans. In a 2023 interview with podcaster Lex Fridman, he seemed to echo the ideas in the patent by saying virtual avatars could take over the accounts of deceased people.

“If someone has lost a loved one and is grieving, there may be ways in which being able to interact or relive certain memories could be helpful,” he told Fridman at the time.

“But then there’s also probably an extent to which it could become unhealthy,” he admitted. “And I mean, I’m not an expert in that, so I think we’d have to study that and understand it in more detail.”

“We have, you know, a fair amount of experience with how to handle death and identity and people’s digital content through social media already, unfortunately,” Zuckerberg said.

It’s not a stretch to assume Meta may have had an ulterior motive to create digital avatars masquerading as the deceased. Facebook has quickly turned into a graveyard of long-forgotten accounts, never-ending ads, unanswered birthday wishes, and updates from that band you hadn’t thought about since high school. At the same time, its feeds are filling with toxic AI slop.

As engagement drops, the company’s core business — selling ads — could take a hit.

“It’s more engagement, more content, more data — more data for the current and the future AI,” University of Birmingham law professor Edina Harbinja told BI. “I can see the business incentive for that. I’m just curious to see how they would, when, and if they will implement this innovation.”

Other experts were taken aback by the idea of training an LLM on a deceased person’s posts.

“One of the tasks of grief is to face the actual loss,” University of Virginia sociology professor Joseph Davis told BI. “Let the dead be dead.”

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">A government customer of sanctioned spyware maker Intellexa hacked the phone of a prominent journalist in Angola, according to Amnesty International, the latest case of targeting someone in civil society with powerful phone-hacking software.

The human rights organization published a new report Tuesday analyzing several hacking attempts against local journalist and press freedom activist Teixeira Cândido, in which he was sent a series of malicious links via WhatsApp during 2024.

Cândido eventually clicked on one and his iPhone was hacked with Intellexa’s spyware, dubbed Predator, Amnesty found.

The new research shows again that government customers of commercial surveillance vendors are increasingly using spyware to target journalists, politicians, and other ordinary citizens, including critics. Researchers have previously found evidence of Predator abuse in Egypt, Greece, and Vietnam, where the government reportedly targeted U.S. officials by sending the spyware via links on X.

Intellexa is one of the most controversial spyware makers of the last few years, operating from different jurisdictions to skirt export laws and using an “opaque web of corporate entities” — as a U.S government official put it at the time — to hide its activities.

In 2024, around the same time one of Intellexa’s customers was targeting Cândido with its spyware, the outgoing Biden administration sanctioned the company, as well as its founder Tal Dilian and his business partner Sara Aleksandra Fayssal Hamou.

Earlier this year, the Treasury lifted sanctions against three other executives tied to Intellexa, a decision that left Senate Democrats demanding answers from the Trump administration.

Dilian did not respond to a request for comment.

Amnesty researchers wrote in the report that they linked the intrusions to Intellexa by examining forensic traces found on Cândido’s phone. Amnesty said that Intellexa used infection servers that had been previously linked to the company’s spyware infrastructure.

Several hours after clicking on the link that led to his phone hack, Cândido rebooted his phone, which wiped the spyware from his device. Amnesty said it wasn’t clear how the spyware was capable of hacking Cândido’s phone, as his phone was running an outdated version of iOS at the time.

The researchers found that Predator stayed hidden by impersonating legitimate iOS system processes to avoid detection.

Amnesty believes Cândido may be just one of many targets in the country, based on their findings that they were able to find multiple domains linked to the spyware maker used in Angola.

“The first domains linked to Angola were deployed as early as March 2023, indicating the start of Predator testing or deployment in the country,” wrote the Amnesty researchers, who added that they had no evidence to determine exactly who hacked Cândido.

“It is not currently possible to conclusively identify the customer of the Predator spyware in the country,” read the report.

Last year, based on leaks of internal documents, Amnesty and media organizations revealed that Intellexa employees had the ability to access customers’ systems remotely, potentially giving the spyware maker visibility into government surveillance operations.

Those leaks, like this report, shows that despite its controversies and sanctions, Intellexa has remained active in recent years.

“We’ve now seen confirmed abuses in Angola, Egypt, Pakistan, Greece, and beyond — and for every case we uncover, many more abuses surely remain hidden,” said Donncha Ó Cearbhaill, the head of the security lab at Amnesty International.

            <div id="article-text">Jack Altman and Benchmark announced today that he would be joining the firm as a general partner.

This news is a big deal, especially since Altman has been running his own VC firm, Alt Capital, since at least 2024. The fund raised a $150 million Fund I in early 2024 and then, just last September, announced a $274 million Fund II, raised in just a week. On LinkedIn, Altman called the past two years running Alt Capital as an investor “the most rewarding” of his life, adding that he loved “new ideas and being part of a team with a mission.”

Alt Capital invested in at least 52 companies, according to PitchBook, including Rippling, Antares Nuclear, and CompLabs. It’s unclear what happens to Alt Capital or whether Benchmark has acquired its portfolio, as Altman also announced that his teammates from the fund will be following him to Benchmark. (That’s also unusual, given Benchmark has historically been structured as a flat firm with primarily GPs only, versus layers of investors.)

Altman also said he will retain the board seats at the companies he backed while at Alt Capital.

Altman did not respond to requests for comment earlier today; Benchmark declined to comment.

Altman, a younger brother of OpenAI co-founder Sam, is also the founder of the HR platform Lattice, which he still chairs, per his LinkedIn profile.

            <p><strong>TechCrunch | 2026-02-17</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/17/ford-turns-to-f1-and-bounties-to-build-a-30000-electric-truck/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Ford is promising to deliver an EV truck next year that starts at $30,000 and can compete with Chinese automakers without undermining profit margins. A combination of 3D-printed Lego-like parts, Formula 1 thinking, and a bounty program will help the company hit that target, Ford said Tuesday.

It will have to. Ford took a $19.5 billion hit in December and ended production of its battery-electric F-150 Lightning. It can’t afford for this new EV business strategy to fall flat.

Ford’s bet on a line of affordable EVs began several years ago with a skunkworks team led by Alan Clarke, a 12-year Tesla veteran. Pieces of its plan were revealed last August, when Ford said it would ditch its traditional moving assembly line and invest $2 billion in its Louisville factory to adopt a new production system that promises to speed up manufacturing by 15%.

The company said at the time that its line of EVs would be built on a universal platform with single-piece aluminum unicastings — large components cast as one piece to eliminate parts and allow for faster assembly — and lithium iron phosphate batteries with tech licensed from China’s CATL.

Now Ford is sharing more specifics in a flurry of blog and social media posts on how it will fulfill its promise of a desirable EV truck that will be $20,000 cheaper than the average new vehicle while still generating profits. Ford didn’t share specs like the range, features, or charging times of this future EV. But it did reveal how it plans to build lighter, cheaper, more efficient EVs made with fewer parts.

It all starts with the universal EV platform, or UEV. The platform will underpin a midsized truck first, then could support a sedan, crossover, three-row SUV, and even small commercial vans, according to Clarke. The UEV is Ford’s first “clean sheet” EV built from the ground up — a strategic shift for the company, which built its Mustang Mach-E and the Lightning EVs using existing infrastructure and manufacturing practices.

“It’s a platform that is built around efficiency,” Clarke said in a briefing with the media. “It’s built around affordability to be able to make long-range electric vehicle travel affordable to more people.”

To achieve that, Clarke set out to create a new culture seeded by talent from Formula 1 and companies like Apple, Lucid Motors, Rivian, and Tesla, as well as Auto Motive Power, a startup acquired by Ford in 2023. The team, which includes about 450 people at its base in Long Beach, California, and 200 people in an office in Palo Alto, also adopted a bounty program to help engineers understand how their day-to-day decisions impact the customer and the end product, Clarke said in an interview with reporters.

The focus of the bounty program was efficiency. Numerical metrics were assigned to every aspect of the UEV, including vehicle mass, aerodynamic drag, and even specific vehicle parts. In practice, this meant Ford might decide to use a more expensive part if it helped decrease the weight of the EV, thereby making it more efficient and cost-effective.

“We’ve been very focused on making sure that the cost that we’re moving from the product doesn’t remove value,” Clarke said. One example is that even the base trim of the EV truck will have a power-folding mirror, a premium feature on most vehicles, because it decreases aerodynamic drag, according to Clarke. The company saved money by using one motor, instead of two, to handle the mirror adjustment and the folding.

That obsession with efficiency included a team of ex-Formula 1 engineers who worked closely with Ford’s design team. The result, according to Ford, is a midsized EV truck that is 15% more aerodynamically efficient than any other pickup truck on the market today.

This team of former F1 engineers used 3D-printed and machined parts to create a Lego-like build for its test vehicle. Thousands of 3D-printed components, which are accurate within fractions of a millimeter of Ford’s simulations and could be swapped out in minutes, were used to measure aerodynamics. These Lego-like prototypes were used in wind tunnel testing early on — and often — to measure aerodynamics, a process that Ford traditionally used only when the design of a vehicle was nearly complete.

A natural place to focus was on the battery, which can account for about 40% of a vehicle’s total expense. A lighter, more efficient vehicle allows Ford to use a smaller battery, which reduces cost. The end result, according to Clarke, will be an EV truck with about 15% more range, or 50 miles, than an equivalent pickup powered by gas.

The efficiency push also led the team to adopt manufacturing tactics adopted and popularized by Tesla, including the use of aluminum unicastings and moving from a 12-volt system to a 48-volt power system that will be used for some vehicle functions.

Ford also upended the electric vehicle architecture of the UEV, taking a zonal approach similar to Tesla and Rivian. Instead of scattering dozens of electronic control units (ECUs), or computers, throughout the vehicle, Ford has integrated multiple vehicle functions into five main modules. This reduces complexity, cost, and copper usage and helped make the EV truck’s wire harness 4,000 feet shorter and 22 pounds lighter than one of its first-generation electric vehicles, according to Luccas Di Tullio, a software engineer at Ford who previously worked at Auto Motive Power.

Di Tullio said the company carried the same philosophy to the power electronic components, finding ways to share components and reduce parts with a single module that manages power distribution and battery management and provides AC power back to a customer’s home during an outage.

Ford also developed its own software for those five main ECUs, down to the application layer, according to Clarke. Because Ford owns the software — to the lowest level — it becomes very portable, Clarke said.

“Other than being able to control the infotainment, what shows up on the screens, [and] how you interact with the vehicle, all of the body controls then are directly coupled,” he said. “So you can imagine that many of the experiences that can only be created by coupling all the different sensors around the vehicle are now at our fingertips and under our own control.”

            <h2>Meta’s own research found parental supervision doesn’t really help curb teens’ compulsive social media use</h2>
            <p><strong>TechCrunch | 2026-02-17</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/17/metas-own-research-found-parental-supervision-doesnt-really-help-curb-teens-compulsive-social-media-use/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">An internal research study at Meta dubbed “Project MYST” created in partnership with the University of Chicago, found that parental supervision and controls — such as time limits and restricted access — had little impact on kids’ compulsive use of social media. The study also found that kids who experienced stressful life events were more likely to lack the ability to moderate their social media use appropriately.

This was one of the notable claims revealed during testimony at the social media addiction trial that began last week in Los Angeles County Superior Court. The plaintiff in the lawsuit is identified by her initials “KGM” or her first name, “Kaley.” She, along with her mother and others joining the case, is accusing social media companies of creating “addictive and dangerous” products that led the young users to suffer anxiety, depression, body dysmorphia, eating disorders, self-harm, suicidal ideation, and more.

The case is now one of several landmark trials that will take place this year, which accuse social media companies of harming children. The results of these lawsuits will impact these companies’ approach to their younger users and could prompt regulators to take further action.

In this case, the plaintiff sued Meta, YouTube, ByteDance (TikTok), and Snap, but the latter two companies had settled their claims before the trial’s start.

In the jury trial now underway in LA, Kaley’s lawyer, Mark Lanier, brought up an internal study at Meta, which he said found evidence that Meta knew of, yet didn’t publicize, these specific harms.

In Project MYST, which stands for the Meta and Youth Social Emotional Trends survey, Meta’s research concluded that “parental and household factors have little association with teens’ reported levels of attentiveness to their social media use.”

Or, in other words, even when parents try to control their children’s social media use, either by using parental controls or even just household rules and supervision, it doesn’t impact whether or not the child will overuse social media or use it compulsively. The study was based on a survey of 1,000 teens and their parents about their social media use.

The study also noted that both parents and teens agreed on this front, saying “there is no association between either parental reports or teen reports of parental supervision, and teens’ survey measures of attentiveness or capability.”

If the study’s findings are accurate, that would mean that the use of things like the built-in parental controls in the Instagram app or the time limits on smartphones wouldn’t necessarily help teens become less inclined to overuse social media, the plaintiff’s lawyer argued. As the original complaint alleges, teens are being exploited by social media products, whose defects include algorithmic feeds designed to keep users scrolling, intermittent variable rewards that manipulate dopamine delivery, incessant notifications, deficient tools for parental controls, and more.

During his testimony, Instagram head Adam Mosseri claimed not to be familiar with Meta’s Project MYST, even though a document seemed to indicate he had given his approval to move forward with the study.

“We do a lot of research projects,” Mosseri said, after claiming he couldn’t remember anything specific about MYST beyond its name.

However, the plaintiff’s lawyer pointed to this study as an example of why social media companies should be held accountable for their alleged harms, not the parents. He noted that Kaley’s mother, for example, had tried to stop her daughter’s social media addiction and use, even taking her phone away at times.

What’s more, the study found that teens who had a greater number of adverse life experiences — like those dealing with alcoholic parents, harassment at school, or other issues — reported less attentiveness over their social media use. That means that kids facing trauma in their real lives were more at risk of addiction, the lawyer argued.

On the stand, Mosseri seemed to partially agree with this finding, saying, “There’s a variety of reasons this can be the case. One I’ve heard often is that people use Instagram as a way to escape from a more difficult reality.” Meta is careful not to label any sort of overuse as addiction; instead, Mosseri stated that the company uses the term “problematic use” to refer to someone “spending more time on Instagram than they feel good about.”

Lawyers for Meta, meanwhile, pushed the idea that the study was more narrowly focused on understanding if teens felt they were using social media too much, not whether or not they were actually addicted. They also generally aimed to put more of the responsibility on parents and the realities of life as the catalyst for kids like Kaley’s negative emotional states, not companies’ social media products.

For instance, Meta’s lawyers pointed to Kaley being a child of divorced parents, with an abusive father, and facing bullying at school.

How the jury will interpret the findings of studies like Project MYST and others, along with the testimonies from both sides, remains to be seen. Mosseri did note, however, that MYST’s findings had not been published publicly, and no warnings were ever issued to teens or parents as a result of the research.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Late last month, The Information reported that Apple was developing an AI wearable — an AirTag-sized pendant with cameras that could be pinned to a user’s shirt. Now, Bloomberg writes that the development of such a device — along with two other AI-powered items — is accelerating as Apple looks to stay competitive with other tech giants that are racing to release similar products.

In addition to the AI pin, Apple is also speeding up the development of its upcoming AI-powered smart glasses, which have been code-named N50, the report claims. Apple obviously has competition in this space, as other companies — including Meta (which is arguably the most successful player when it comes to smart glasses) and Snap (which plans to release its “Specs” later this year) — are working on similar products.

Apple’s new smart glasses, which will supposedly include a high-resolution camera, may see a public release sooner rather than later, with Bloomberg reporting that the company is “targeting the start of production as early as December, ahead of a public release in 2027.”

Additionally, Bloomberg reports that Apple is working on AirPods with new AI capabilities.

All of these items will be designed to connect to the iPhone and will include Siri, the company’s virtual assistant, as a critical component of the user experience, the outlet notes. The glasses are being described as “more upscale and feature-rich” than the AirPods and the AI pendant, however. TechCrunch reached out to Apple for more information.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Thrive Capital just raised $10 billion for a new fund — the largest fund it has ever raised and nearly double the size of its last fund. Of this, $1 billion is dedicated to early-stage investments, while the rest is for growth-stage investments, according to an announcement from the firm.

Thrive told Bloomberg that this latest fundraise was oversubscribed. This is the firm’s 10th fund — called Thrive X — and comes as some of the firm’s biggest investments, including OpenAI, Stripe, and SpaceX, continue to soar in value. Some of the firm’s other notable investments include Databricks, Anduril, and Cursor. The firm also incubates companies, having spun up 12 so far, with at least six now having reached unicorn status.

The firm’s strategy is to “commit deeply to a small number of founders,” the firm said in its announcement. “Concentration demands loyalty to the founders and missions we back.”

Speaking to Bloomberg, Josh Kushner, founder of the firm, said he believed the winners of the AI boom would “be bigger than we can ever imagine,” and that the technology is still nascent.

Thrive’s massive raise also hints at something else. IPO rumors have swirled around OpenAI and SpaceX in particular, bringing considerable interest from limited partners awaiting returns. These two companies could lead to an unprecedented flow of capital back to limited partners.

We’ve reached out to Thrive for more information.

            <h2>Do Not Be Cynical About Jesse Jackson</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-02-17</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/2026/02/jesse-jackson-legacy-race/686030/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">When I was growing up in Washington, D.C., in the 1990s, many businesses proudly kept in their windows signs from Jesse Jackson’s 1984 and ’88 presidential runs. He was a revered figure, someone people in D.C. were deeply thankful for.

“Nothing will ever again be what it was before,” the writer James Baldwin said after Jackson’s ’84 Democratic National Convention speech.

“It changes the way the boy on the street and the boy on Death Row and his mother and his father and his sweetheart and his sister think about themselves. It indicates that one is not entirely at the mercy of the assumptions of this Republic, of what they have said you are, that this is not necessarily who and what you are. And no one will ever forget this moment, no matter what happens now.”

Yet when you turned on the television, you saw another Jesse Jackson. This Jesse Jackson was a dangerous man, a radical, a demagogue, someone who thrived off fomenting racial division. To the people around me, Jackson—the reverend and civil-rights leader—was a hero. But to the people I saw discussing the news on television, he was both an incendiary agitator and a ridiculous, almost comic, figure. The subtext of all this commentary was that Black Americans would make more progress if their leaders were not so flawed. Barack Obama put the lie to this argument; squeaky-clean by personal-conduct standards, all he did was drive the same people who hated Jackson more insane.

“Have you ever noticed how all composite pictures of wanted criminals resemble Jesse Jackson?” the right-wing radio host Rush Limbaugh mused in the 1990s. His opinions on Obama were no less unhinged.

Ali Breland: The Epstein emails show how the powerful talk about race

“There has developed among many, for sure, a kind of attitudinal air-barrier of cynicism” around Jackson, Marshall Frady, a journalist and the author of Jesse: The Life and Pilgrimage of Jesse Jackson, once said. “Part of it is, no doubt, a reflection of the abiding, if not steadily deepening, racial schism in the country since the ’60s.” Jackson was one of Martin Luther King Jr.’s youngest lieutenants; he came of age when many considered racial injustice history, an issue the country had already dealt with. He reminded Americans that King’s dream had not yet come, and that created for him enemies. In hindsight, it seems strange that people would assume that the effects of centuries of slavery and segregation would be entirely wiped away in fewer than two decades. Jackson had grown up in poverty in the shadow of Jim Crow segregation; it must have seemed even more absurd to him.

It was common for right-wingers to refer to him as a “race pimp” or “race hustler.” He did himself no favors when, in 1984, he used an anti-Jewish slur—calling New York City “hymietown”—in a conversation overheard by a reporter. Jackson apologized for the ugly remark, but it followed him for the rest of his life—in mainstream media, the incident was practically a second appellation, right after “the Reverend.” In 1989, the Fox News founder Roger Ailes, then an adviser to Rudy Giuliani’s mayoral campaign, placed an ad in a Yiddish newspaper with a photo of Giuliani’s rival David Dinkins next to Jackson—the two were friends. The clear implication was that Dinkins was an anti-Semite, just like Jackson. In this way, Jackson became an easy shorthand propagandists could use to terrify white people into voting Republican.

Yet this caricature of Jackson as an anti-white, anti-Semitic demagogue never reflected the man. The entire point of Jackson’s “Rainbow Coalition,” his vision of Americans from all backgrounds coming together for social justice, was overcoming such differences. Jackson’s political vision was always inclusive, always multiracial, and always opposed to bigotry and prejudice of all kinds, even if the man himself sometimes fell short.

For one thing, Jackson’s egalitarianism and support for a strong welfare state—including universal health care—did not contradict his emphasis on personal responsibility and the importance of the Church in Americans’ lives. As Frady notes, the South Carolina reverend was constantly hammering on these conservative-friendly themes, long before they became part of Ronald Reagan or Bill Clinton’s presidential campaigns.

“Black Americans must begin to accept a larger share of responsibility for their lives. For too many years we have been crying that racism and oppression have kept us down,” Jackson wrote in The New York Times, in 1976. “That is true, and racism and oppression have to be fought on every front. But to fight any battle takes soldiers who are strong, healthy, spirited, committed, well‐trained and confident.”

The 1984 speech that so moved Baldwin remains one of the greatest articulations of American liberalism ever made. But I was too young to remember it, and it is his 1988 speech that I find indelible. In 1984, Jackson described America as a “quilt” with “many patches, many pieces, many colors, many sizes, all woven and held together by a common thread.” In 1988, he extended the metaphor—arguing that progress could not be made without the aid of people from very different backgrounds, with very different identities.

“Farmers, you seek fair prices and you are right—but you cannot stand alone. Your patch is not big enough. Workers, you fight for fair wages, you are right—but your patch of labor is not big enough. Women, you seek comparable worth and pay equity, you are right—but your patch is not big enough,” Jackson said. “Students, you seek scholarships, you are right—but your patch is not big enough. Blacks and Hispanics, when we fight for civil rights, we are right—but our patch is not big enough.”

Many obituaries have emphasized Jackson’s hunger for publicity. He was, indeed, no wallflower. But neither did he simply pose for the cameras. Jackson’s decades of activism demonstrated that he was sincere about his vision. When workers were striking, Jackson was there. When it was unpopular to support LGBTQ rights, Jackson did so anyway. When both conservatives and liberals were outraged over illegal immigration, Jackson insisted on mercy and understanding for the undocumented. Despite the “hymie” incident, Jackson never stopped condemning the evils of anti-Semitism, even as he supported Palestinian rights and statehood. Before Pat Buchanan or Donald Trump ran for president, Jackson was condemning “American multinationals” who “hire repressed labor abroad and fire free labor at home.&#39;&#39;

The critics who caricatured him did not understand this sincerity—or perhaps they understood it far too well. His commitment to the people he once described as “the desperate, the damned, the disinherited, the disrespected, and the despised,” was real, and he dedicated his life to it.

Clint Smith: Those who try to erase history will fail

Jackson’s sincerity eventually overcame the stereotypes about him. In the early 1990s, only a third of white Americans viewed him favorably; by 1999, that number was close to 60 percent, including, The New York Times reported, many “self-described conservatives.”

Democratic leaders credited Jackson’s work registering Black voters with making otherwise-difficult gains in the wilderness of the Reagan era. He was a genuinely transformative figure, inspiring not just a generation of Black voters but Black officeholders, helping usher in an era of Black self-determination that eclipsed the previous peak during Reconstruction a century earlier. His exhortation to “keep hope alive” in an era of backlash was precisely what he did. Frady quotes former San Francisco Mayor Willie Brown calling Jackson “the Jackie Robinson of American politics,” who would “spawn a whole lot of Little Leaguers in many cities and counties that you and I will never hear about.” That was, we now know, an understatement.

The epithet of “race hustler” or “race pimp” can be more accurately applied to many of Jackson’s critics, who perceived his multiracial populism as a threat. They tried to neutralize that threat by turning Jackson into a racial caricature that could be exploited to fan the fears of white Americans that they would be dispossessed, the same inversion of American history that continues to drive right-wing politics in the present. They did not make a caricature of Jackson because he was ridiculous; they tried to make him ridiculous because his vision was so powerful.</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">This is an edition of The Atlantic Daily, a newsletter that guides you through the biggest stories of the day, helps you discover new ideas, and recommends the best in culture. Sign up for it here.

Stephen Colbert’s Late Show ends in May, and he’s in almost open warfare with his soon-to-be ex-bosses at CBS. Last night, he had planned to broadcast an interview with James Talarico, a member of the Texas state House who is running in a heated Democratic primary for United States Senate. But it was not to be.

At the start of his show, Colbert told viewers that CBS had barred him from airing the interview, citing threats from Brendan Carr, the chair of the Federal Communications Commission. (You may remember Carr as the guy who sounded like a cartoon mobster while trying to get Jimmy Kimmel fired—“We can do this the easy way or the hard way”—drawing a rebuke from Senator Ted Cruz.)

Colbert savaged CBS. He said that the network had told him not to talk about it, which he defied in dramatic fashion. “I want to assure you, ladies and gentlemen—please—I want to assure you, this decision is for purely financial reasons,” he joked, a sly reference to the rationale that CBS gave for ending his show. Colbert posted the interview on his show’s YouTube channel. CBS said in a statement that The Late Show “was not prohibited by CBS from broadcasting the interview with Rep. James Talarico. The show was provided legal guidance that the broadcast could trigger the FCC equal-time rule for two other candidates, including Rep. Jasmine Crockett, and presented options for how the equal time for other candidates could be fulfilled.”

I wrote in July that CBS’s leadership had lost the benefit of the doubt, and the network’s actions since its parent company’s merger with Skydance and the appointment of Bari Weiss as editor in chief of CBS News have reinforced that. CBS deserves plenty of criticism for cowardice. But that doesn’t mean it’s incorrect to fear FCC action.

Last month, the FCC issued a notice about the equal-time rule, a century-old regulation that says that a broadcast station that provides time to one candidate must provide an equal forum to a rival. The rule has an exemption for “bona fide news”—basically, producers can decide what to cover in their programming, because anything else would constitute government interference in the free press. In 2006, the FCC determined that interviews on The Tonight Show With Jay Leno fit under the exemption even if they are not strictly news programming, a precedent that shows have relied on since.

But the new notice states that “the FCC has not been presented with any evidence that the interview portion of any late night or daytime television talk show program on air presently would qualify for the bona fide news exemption.” (Carr has not extended this reasoning to talk radio, which conservatives dominate.) This is not just bluster. Earlier this month, Fox News reported that the FCC was investigating ABC’s daytime talk show The View, which has become an important stop for politicians seeking to reach the show’s heavily female audience, for violating the equal-time rule. The reported object of Carr’s ire? An interview with one James Talarico.

The Talarico dustups are among several incidents in the past few days that show the Trump administration’s enthusiasm for censoring speech by both the press and ordinary citizens. One year ago, I wrote that Donald Trump and his allies were free-speech phonies who, having campaigned against censorship, were eager to impose it. The threat to First Amendment rights has gotten worse since then.

Earlier this month, The Washington Post’s John Woodrow Cox reported on a retiree who used a publicly available email address to encourage an attorney at the Department of Homeland Security to have mercy on an asylum seeker. In response, DHS sent federal agents to the man’s door and demanded access to his Google accounts, using a tool called an administrative subpoena that doesn’t require a judge or grand jury to approve. On Friday, The New York Times reported that Google, Reddit, Discord, and Meta in recent months have received “hundreds” of administrative subpoenas from DHS seeking access to information about the accounts of people who have criticized the government. (DHS told both papers that it was acting within its authority but didn’t give any detailed response.)

The goals of both DHS and the FCC in these cases are to intimidate critics and stifle dissent. This is staggering hypocrisy. During the presidential campaign, Trump accused the Biden administration of undermining free speech by asking—though not demanding—that social-media companies remove misinformation about COVID. On day one of his administration, Trump issued an executive order that charged, “Over the last 4 years, the previous administration trampled free speech rights by censoring Americans’ speech on online platforms, often by exerting substantial coercive pressure on third parties, such as social media companies, to moderate, deplatform, or otherwise suppress speech that the Federal Government did not approve.” This is a good description of what Trump’s administration is doing now.

Some repression efforts fail. Last week, the federal district-court judge Richard Leon, a President George W. Bush appointee, temporarily blocked Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth from punishing Senator Mark Kelly, a Navy veteran, for a video in which he and other members of Congress remind current service members that they can and should refuse illegal orders. “This Court has all it needs to conclude that Defendants have trampled on Senator Kelly’s First Amendment freedoms and threatened the constitutional liberties of millions of military retirees,” Leon wrote.

The ruling is a welcome defense of Americans’ freedoms, but it can’t reverse all of the damage. Kelly is unusually well positioned to fight back and take the administration to court. Not every would-be critic is. And censorship, once established by a president, has ways of spreading its tendrils to other institutions. At one state university in Texas, for example, a philosophy professor was forced to remove passages of Plato from his syllabus because of new policies passed by governor-appointed regents, and an art exhibition critical of ICE was abruptly canceled at another Texas university.

These attacks are clearly partisan: They all target speech by critics of the president, his party, or his policies. But they should be scary even if you feel that Colbert doesn’t deserve a news exemption, The View is too liberal, or Kelly was out of line. Crackdowns on speech by prominent figures pave a way for the government to regulate speech more broadly, which should be concerning for people of any political leaning because the party and people in power can change.

During a Senate hearing last week, Senator Ron Johnson, a Wisconsin Republican, accused Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison, a Democrat, of being responsible for the deaths of Alex Pretti and Renee Good because he supported protests. Johnson began, “Did you ever encourage people to go out there and exercise the First—”

“I freely admit being in favor of the First Amendment,” Ellison shot back. This position is apparently not as common among elected officials as you might hope.

Here are three new stories from The Atlantic:

The most striking passages in Picky, a forthcoming book by the historian Helen Zoe Veit, describe the way famous 19th-century American figures ate as children. I found myself gripped with envy as I read—not because the foods were particularly appetizing, but because I would kill for my kid to eat like that.

To wit: As a girl, Edith Wharton adored oyster sauce, turtle, stewed celery, cooked tomatoes, and lima beans in cream. Mark Twain fondly remembered eating succotash, string beans, squirrels, and rabbits on his uncle’s farm. And during her childhood, Veit writes, Elizabeth Cady Stanton “happily ate vegetables, hickory nuts, and cold jellied brain.”

If these don’t sound like typical “kid foods,” that’s because they aren’t, and weren’t. “Kid food,” as a category, is a recent invention.

Read. In Toni Morrison’s novels, she located the missing stories of Black America, Judith Shulevitz writes.

Reminisce. David Sims explores how Robert Duvall could carry a film thunderously, yet also stand out in the subtlest of roles.

            <h2>AI Agents Are Taking America by Storm</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-02-17</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/2026/02/post-chatbot-claude-code-ai-agents/686029/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Americans are living in parallel AI universes. For much of the country, AI has come to mean ChatGPT, Google’s AI overviews, and the slop that now clogs social-media feeds. Meanwhile, tech hobbyists are becoming radicalized by bots that can work for hours on end, collapsing months of work into weeks, or weeks into an afternoon.

Recently, more people have started to play around with tools such as Claude Code. The product, made by the start-up Anthropic, is “agentic,” meaning it can do all sorts of work a human might do on a computer. Some academics are testing Claude Code’s ability to autonomously generate papers; others are using agents for biology research. Journalists have been experimenting with Claude Code to write data-driven articles from scratch, and earlier this month, a pair used the bot to create a mock competitor to Monday.com, a public software company worth billions. In under an hour, they had a working prototype. Although the actual quality of all of these AI-generated papers and analyses remains unclear, the progress is both stunning and alarming. “Once a computer can use computers, you’re off to the races,” Dean Ball, a senior fellow at the Foundation for American Innovation, told me.

Even as AI has advanced, the most sophisticated bots have yet to go fully mainstream. Unlike ChatGPT, which has a free tier, agentic tools such as Claude Code or OpenAI’s Codex typically cost money, and can be intimidating to set up. I run Claude Code out of my computer’s terminal, an app traditionally reserved for programmers, and which looks like something a hacker uses in movies. It’s also not always obvious how best to prompt agentic bots: A sophisticated user might set up teams of agents that message one another as they work, whereas a newbie might not realize such capabilities even exist.

The tech industry is now rushing to develop more accessible versions of these products for the masses. Last month, Anthropic released a new paid version of Claude Code designed for nontechnical users; today the start-up debuted a new model to all users, which offers, among other things, “human-level capability in tasks like navigating a complex spreadsheet.” Meanwhile, OpenAI recently announced a new version of Codex, which the company claims can do nearly anything “professionals can do on a computer.” As these products have gained visibility, people seem to be realizing all at once that AI does a lot more than draft marketing copy and offer friendly conversation. The post-chatbot era is here.

Tools such as ChatGPT and Gemini may already feel powerful enough in their own right. Indeed, chatbots have assumed all kinds of fancy new features over the past few years. They now have memory, which lets them reference previous conversations, and use a technique called reasoning to produce more sophisticated responses. Whereas older chatbots could ingest a few thousand words at a time, today they can analyze book-length files, as well as process and produce images, video, and audio.

But all of this pales in comparison to the rise of agentic tools. Consider software engineering, where they have proven to be particularly transformative. It’s now common for engineers to essentially hand over instructions to a bot such as Claude Code or Codex, and let them do the rest. Because bots aren’t constrained in the way humans are, a programmer might have several sessions running simultaneously, all working on different aspects of a project. “In general, it is now clear that for most projects, writing the code yourself is no longer sensible,” the computer programmer Salvatore Sanfilippo wrote in a recent viral essay. In just a few hours, Sanfilippo noted, he had completed several tasks that previously would have taken weeks. Microsoft’s CEO has said that as much as 30 percent of code is now written by AI, and the company’s chief technical officer expects that figure to hit 95 percent industry-wide by the end of the decade. Anthropic already reports that up to 90 percent of the company’s code is AI generated.

Some programmers have started to warn that similar advances could cannibalize all kinds of knowledge work. Last week, Matt Shumer, the CEO of an AI company, compared the current moment in AI to the early days of COVID, when most Americans were still oblivious to the imminent pandemic. “Making AI great at coding was the strategy that unlocks everything else,” wrote Shumer. “The experience that tech workers have had over the past year, of watching AI go from ‘helpful tool’ to ‘does my job better than I do’, is the experience everyone else is about to have.” (His essay, which has upwards of 80 million views, was partially AI generated.)

Tech executives have a strong incentive to suggest that similar advances will soon come for other forms of work. Last week, Microsoft’s AI chief predicted that AI will automate “most, if not all” white-collar work tasks within 18 months. (This led to a series of social-media posts like the following: “CEO of Hot Pockets ™ says that ‘most, if not all’ meals will be fully replaced with Hot Pockets ™ within the next 12 to 18 months.”)

It’s not yet clear how easily the progress in agentic tools will translate to other fields. Programming is well suited to automation: Software programs either work or they don’t. Determining what counts as a good essay, for example, is a far messier task, and one that requires much more human discernment. Though agentic tools often excel at complicated work, such as synthesizing unfathomable reams of text, they struggle to do something as simple as copy and paste text from Google Docs into Substack. And because they are so powerful, they can also be dangerous: When one venture capitalist recently asked Claude Cowork—Anthropic’s new, more accessible agentic tool—for help organizing his wife’s desktop, the bot subsequently deleted 15 years of family photos. “I need to stop and be honest with you about something important,” the bot told him. “I made a mistake.”

Even if AI isn’t yet a world-class financial analyst or architect, coding bots have progressed to the point where they are already able to assist with all kinds of knowledge work. Since Claude Code took off, I’ve watched people I know start using the bot for all sorts of tasks, realizing just how much more capable agentic tools are than traditional chatbots. In my own job, I’ve found agents particularly adept at research. When I recently asked Claude Code for a report on trends in Gen Z political views, I fired off a brief query and my team of bots got to work: One scoured the web for information, while another performed data analysis, and a third wrote up the findings in a briefing for me to review. (Like other kinds of AI, Claude Code can hallucinate: When using the tool for research, I still carefully verify information against original sources before referencing it in my own writing, which—to be clear—I do myself.)

The industry is hopeful that agentic tools will continue to improve. The AI-coding boom is boosting tech companies’ abilities to improve their own products, as engineers use agentic tools to write software. But Silicon Valley has long dreamed of building AI models that can improve themselves, each new generation of AI models able to spawn its successor. On a recent call with reporters, I asked Sam Altman, OpenAI’s CEO, what it would take to get there: Such progress would require models capable of both producing “new scientific insight and writing a lot of complex code,” he told me. “The models are starting to be able to do both of those things.” Still, he cautioned, we’re not yet at a moment of runaway AI progress. (The Atlantic has a corporate partnership with OpenAI.) Last month, Boris Cherny, the Anthropic employee who created Claude Code, told me that “Claude is starting to come up with its own ideas and it’s proposing what to build.”

Without inside access to these companies, it’s difficult to know what to make of these claims. And as impressive as agentic tools already are, it could still take quite a long time for them to become safe and reliable enough for widespread use. Even if technology capabilities continue to progress rapidly, the real world is messy and complicated. Silicon Valley sometimes mistakes “clear vision with short distance,” the Stanford computer scientist Fei-Fei Li said earlier this month. “But the journey is going to be long.”

Tech companies have done a tremendous job of persuading investors to pour cash into their businesses, but the industry has done a much worse job at selling the public on its vision. Instead of focusing on tangible benefits of AI agents, Silicon Valley has spent years hype-washing the technology with business briefs that read like science fiction. In one influential essay, Dario Amodei, Anthropic’s CEO, writes that powerful AI could soon eliminate most cancer and nearly all infectious diseases. In another, a team of researchers warns that within the decade, rogue AI might release biological weapons, wiping out nearly all of humanity. Bots that can handle spreadsheet work and automate coding might not amount to superintelligence, but they are still immensely powerful. To the extent that normies remain confused about AI’s true capabilities, Silicon Valley has only itself to blame.</div>

            <h2>An Olympic Trend That Defies Tradition</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-02-17</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/2026/02/olympics-mixed-gender-ski-mountaineering/686026/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Olympic skimo is a spectacle. Appearing at the Games for the first time, skimo, short for ski mountaineering, grew from a long tradition of scaling mountains on skis—sometimes for hours on end—for the reward of gliding down, preferably through untracked powder. But at the Olympics, it will involve sprints of approximately three and a half minutes. First, athletes ascend a steep slope on skis outfitted with special fabric strips called “skins,” which prevent them from sliding backwards down the hill. Then they throw their skis on their back and hike in ski boots, put their skis back on for a final ascent, and finally peel off their skins to race downhill.  The events will include a mixed-gender skimo relay—“contrived for the Olympic field,” Sarah Cookler, the head of sport for USA Skimo, the sport’s American governing body, told me. Each team will include one man and one woman, each of whom will run the course twice. Anna Gibson and Cam Smith, both making their Olympic debuts, will represent Team USA.

It’s only fitting that such a new sport should debut on the world stage with a format that’s newly popular. Mixed-gender events, in which each team consists of a set number of men and women, have long had a place at the Olympics: Mixed-pairs figure skating and tennis were each introduced to the Games more than a century ago. But recently, such events have been growing in number as part of a deliberate effort to bring more attention to women’s sports. At Milan Cortina, every major sport category but ice hockey features mixed-gender events.

Women participated in the first Winter Olympics, in Chamonix in 1924, but only in figure skating. Women’s speed-skating exhibitions were included in the 1932 Olympics, but no medals were awarded. In 1936, women competed in alpine skiing, but they weren’t allowed in cross-country until 1952. Since then, the Winter Olympics have slowly been approaching a sort of parity, with women participating in an ever-growing number of events once considered too difficult, dangerous, or scandalous for them.

The International Olympic Committee is advertising the 2026 Games as “the most gender-balanced Olympic Winter Games in history.” That’s based on the fact that women will represent 47 percent of athletes participating and compete in 53 percent of all events; this Olympics is also the first where male and female cross-country skiers are competing at the same distances. But in terms of viewership and publicity, the many mixed-gender events may do more to raise the profile of female athletes than women’s events alone.

Women’s sports, including skimo, tend to attract far fewer spectators than men’s sports do. The mixed-gender relay can help bridge this gap, Smith told me, because in events that feature both men and women, viewers are positioned to watch everyone compete. And if the mixed-gender events allow spectators to get to know more female athletes, that could translate into more people watching the women’s stand-alone events. The IOC is leaning into these events: The Los Angeles Games in 2028 will feature 25 mixed-gender events, including new ones in golf, rowing, and artistic gymnastics.

Gibson told me she’s grown accustomed to elite sport spaces separating men and women as much as possible in the name of equity. She’s also a world-class trail runner and accomplished gravel-bike racer, and in those sports, “the talk has been all about giving women their own start in order to elevate women’s competition rather than having women be buried in the men’s field,” she said. Separate men’s and women’s fields have long been the default in most sports, and for good reason: If women had to compete directly with men, they would rarely have a chance to win. But bringing women and men together in competitions that include both gives women their own space and attention while including all the sport’s athletes within one community. It creates “a lot of camaraderie,” Gibson said, and in her experience, adds to the excitement among spectators.

Women, of course, face many obstacles in sport that cannot be solved by the addition of a few mixed-gender Olympic events. Across sports, male athletes are generally paid more than their female counterparts. In skimo, prize money is equal at the sport’s World Cup, but some other races still have unequal payouts, Cookler said. (Gibson said she avoids those.) Women athletes are still sometimes subjected to sexual harassment and abuse, even on the Olympic level. The Winter Olympics still include one event in which women are not allowed to compete at all—Nordic combined, which consists of ski jumping and cross-country skiing. (The IOC is already considering dropping Nordic combined altogether because of low participation and spectator interest; an IOC spokesperson told me the event “will undergo a full evaluation” following this year’s Olympics, and reiterated the committee’s commitment to gender equality.)

And mixed-gender formats can still be subject to unequal dynamics. Biathlon, a Winter Olympics event that combines cross-country skiing and target shooting, has used the mixed-gender relay format since the 2014 Olympics in Sochi. (Biathlon and luge were the first sports to introduce a mixed-gender format to the Winter Games since figure skating and ice dancing in the 20th century.) But “women always went first in our mixed-gender relays, and people felt it was unfair that a woman could never be the anchor,” Joanne Reid, a three-time Olympian who competed for Team USA last week, told me. In 2019, the sport’s governing body restructured the order of the competition so that the gender of the anchor rotates.

Even as mixed-gender events become more common, skimo’s inclusion in future Olympics is not assured. It’s in the 2026 Olympics because the organizers of this year’s Games proposed it; to continue competing, skimo athletes will need organizers at the next venues to propose its inclusion too. Skimo enthusiasts expect this to happen and hope future Olympics will include events that are longer and more representative of the sport’s origins. “Nobody got into skimo to do the sprint relay,” Smith said. But as he began training for the event, he enjoyed it more than he expected. “It’s really fun because we are accountable to each other,” he said. “I’m racing all out because I know that she’s doing the same for me.”</div>

NPR is like BBC radio.  Government funded radio programming without government control.  Some good stuff, some bad.  Underpaid staff making do with old equipment because they believe that doing the work is more important than fame and wealth.

This is the dystopian AI future we&#39;re walking into. Endless generated versions of everything- copies of copies of copies and the original creators just buried under mountains of bullshit. And that&#39;s what they&#39;re aiming for.

The money is injecting hundreds of billions of dollars into this tech so that in a couple of years they can have skinjobs walking around with ripped off liknesses and bootlegged voices doing the things we used to do ourselves without paying us for it.

Ah, those BSOD experiences hanging on lounge room walls like perverted tributes to Blue Man Group..

..as if they could ever be &quot;friendly&quot; enough for the end user crippled with data center parking lot paranoia at 2AM eating a cigarette and smoking a pizza trying to figure out what the fuck they&#39;re going to do after the server shit out its third BSOD, and management was way too cheap to buy after hours support.

In the immortal words of Douglas Adams, I suggest you add Don&#39;t to that DRM Panic screen.  Problem so

DRM, digital rights management greatly predates DRM in the display manager context. It also carries a massively bad connotation to it. DRM in the display manager context just needs to concede that to the clusterF that is digital rights management.

Seriously. Find a better name for KVM while they&#39;re at it.

But I don&#39;t want any DRM.  Can&#39;t we get a panic screen without DRM?

Well you could always get DRM, DRM, Panic, Sausage, and DRM.  That&#39;s only got a little bit of DRM in it.

I always wondered why microsoft didn&#39;t do this or something like it over the decades.

Nowadays (and for a long while) the chances that you have a truly unique problem is low...   (although it looks like we&#39;re heading for a new dark age where  googling relevant error identifiers will yield nothing since nobody actually posted about it on a searchable forum or stack overflow etc.  )

Very true.  Although I hope KDE continues to work equally well on X11 and Wayland.  And on other Unix OSes.  Perhaps even on Windows.  There was a time when I ran KDE on Windows, mostly for kicks.  Alternate shells for Windows have disappeared and been banished by MS, sadly.

Regarding Wayland, it is worth noting that one of the features in the summary---not showing certain windows when screen sharing---is a wayland-only feature.  X11 simply does not have a way to easily do it.

I used to be a supporter of lightweight desktops but now there is really no good reason left to avoid KDE Plasma.

KDE was really the first real DE for Linux, long before Gnome was a thing.  Had it not been for the Qt license issue back then, GTK and Gnome would never have been created. Imagine a world without Gnome and where the GIMP was made from Qt.  Some would like it and others probably shiver.

Back in 1998 I was struggling to learn Red Hat 5.1 with fvwm2, coming from an MS/DOS and Windows 95 background.  KDE 1.0 came out and I downloaded a bunch of RPMs at the uni lab on a zip disk.  I installed it and that changed

Gnome is still the default on the biggest distros, but KDE really should be. KDE is something a non-Linux user can immediately find usable. It does not take much to make Gnome usable, but the biggest Linux distros should not have a broken by default DE that takes several extensions to turn into a DE that has the functionality users expect.

Did they finally institute sensible drag and drop behavior for files or does it still prompt me every time even though Apple had this figured out in the eighties?

It still did as of 6.5.5.  But the nice thing about KDE is you can use whatever parts of it you want.  I&#39;m currently using Caja as the file manager inside of KDE. No particular reason, but it works fine and I think it looks a lot better than Dolphin.

I&#39;ve read there is a config option to make &quot;move&quot; the default like it is on other OS&#39;s, but I can&#39;t find it.  Using shift and ctrl does work like other OS&#39;s and avoids the popup menu.  But yeah it&#39;s awkward, so I&#39;m glad I just use Caja and avoid dolphin altogether.

See the screenshot near the end of this PR https://invent.kde.org/plasma/... [kde.org]

If drag the file it does (dolphin 25.12.2), but if you use the a modifier key (Shift, Control, Ctrl-Shift) then it executes Move/Copy/Link without asking. I personally enjoy the menu, I often use those 3 actions and I like it to ask me. Though I understand this should have been made configurable. I even find a pity it does not offer hardlink in addition to symbolic link.

No company wants to ...Individuals too. I&#39;ve been using VMWare on Mac for over 15 years. Windows VMs, Linux VMs, even macOS VMs with over versions of macOS. One machine to develop for and test all three platforms. 

However I recently switched to Parallels. A Windows VM, a Linux VM, and a macOS VM with the older version of the OS.
As a special bonus, since the new Mac is ARM, I get to run ARM Windows and ARM Linux. Both run really well.

For home labs and smaller businesses, Proxmox seems to be just fine.

A lot of companies are certainly kicking them to the curb.  There are other options.  The mobility and remote access pieces wound up with KKR as Omnissa.  I&#39;m continuing to consume those as KKR understands they&#39;ll never get their return on investment if they chase away their customers.

But that only lasts until people can move. Long enough to earn Tan a really nice chunk of change, and probably also long enough to make VMWare a tiny niche player.

Do yourself a favor and look at XCP-NG/Xen Orchestra and ProxMox.  If your needs fit, both are: open source, run under open source operating systems, free, and work quite well.  And both offer paid support if you need it.

I&#39;ve found proxmox quite nice.  Almost everyone else doing linux virtualization leans on libvirt, and proxmox decided to simplify and prioritize less awkward abstraction and so I find it more straightforward of an architecture than the usual &quot;something over libvirt over qemu&quot; approach.

Indeed.  Both XCP-NG/Xen Orchestra and Proxmox are much better at supporting larger needs.  XCP-NG has a long history of solid virtualization and Xen Orchestra makes managing it a dream.  Proxmox takes a different approach, but is very powerful as well

Two American politicians drew top billing at this past weekend’s Munich Security Conference, where U.S. and European political leaders gather each year to mull the state of the trans-Atlantic alliance—a topic that is now teeming with suspense and peril.

The headliners were Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. The Europeans hoped Rubio would mollify their concerns about President Donald Trump’s commitment to the continent’s defense—or at least erase the memory of last year’s main speaker, J.D. Vance, whose unabashed hostility toward the Western alliance and firm embrace of Germany’s neo-Nazi party set off the crisis between the two continents today.

In this context, they viewed AOC as a possible harbinger of the U.S. leadership’s next generation and wondered—some with excitement, some with dread, almost everyone with curiosity, because she had never appeared at the conference before—just what her ascension might bode.

As it turned out, Rubio proved disappointing, while AOC was too vague to leave behind an outline of the alliance’s future or her chances of rising to its helm—though she expressed reassuring sentiments with (for the most part) encouraging eloquence.

Rubio received a standing ovation at the end of his keynote address on Saturday, mainly because he spoke softly and uttered a few welcome lines that the likes of Vance or, worse still, Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth (who did not attend the conference) would never utter—for instance, “the United States and Europe … belong together,” “We are part of one civilization,” and “Our destiny is, and will always be, intertwined with yours.”

These lines inspired his interlocutor, at the start of a Q&A period, to note “the collective sigh of relief throughout this hall” during the secretary’s “message of reassurance and partnership.”

But those listening with more jaded ears, and nearly everyone who read the transcript afterward, saw it as what might be called Vance-and-Hegseth lite—warm and friendly in tone but pure MAGA in substance, or as Politico paraphrased his message: “Join Donald Trump’s campaign to reshape the world for Washington’s benefit, or get out of the way.”

The traditions that Rubio invoked, in recalling the alliance’s past, were those of nationalism (a subtle rebuke to the European Union, an open rejection of free trade, and a dismissal of international law), Western civilization as Christian civilization (ignoring not just Judeo-Christian heritage but the roughly 25 million Muslims who live in Europe), and the “unapologetic” mission “to build a vast empire out across the globe.”

His call for alliance unity was an invitation for “you” (Europeans) to “join us” (Trump’s America) on our path. His speech—at the world’s most preeminent security conference—did not mention Russia, NATO, or China, but instead listed as the West’s biggest dangers “fear of climate change, fear of war, fear of technology,” and the “mass migration that threatens the cohesion of our societies, the continuity of our culture, and the future of our people.” To renew our alliance, he said, means to “restore a place in the world” that will “rebuke and deter the forces of civilizational erasure that today menace both America and Europe alike.”

We’ve heard this phrase “civilizational erasure” before, from Trump himself. It translates, pretty explicitly, to Make America (and now Europe as well) White Again.

After his appearance in Munich, as if to confirm this impression, and to splash water on those who tried to interpret the speech as a beacon of hope, Rubio flew to Budapest, where he publicly embraced Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán and told him, “I say to you with confidence that President Trump is deeply committed to your success because your success is our success, because this relationship we have here in central Europe through you is so essential and vital for our national interests in the years to come.”

Rubio’s wish for Orbán’s “success” should be viewed in two contexts. First, the prime minister is facing a tough election; Rubio’s words amounted to an open endorsement by Trump. Second, Orbán is universally seen as the EU’s outlier—the Union’s most outspoken critic of democracy, supporter of Russian President Vladimir Putin, and opponent of military aid to Ukraine. In wishing for Orbán’s success, Rubio was thumbing his nose at the entire spectacle—the very purpose—of the Munich Security Conference. Basically, he was repeating, through his actions, Vance’s aggressively hostile speech last year.

If Rubio had gone to Munich after Hungary, the gist of his speech would have been grasped without illusion. Even before the speech, he gave what should have been seen as a hint of his real intentions by brushing off a meeting, which he’d been scheduled to attend, on the security of Ukraine.

Usually several members of Congress attend the Munich conference, though this time House Speaker Mike Johnson barred the funding of their flights, in anticipation of the impasse that froze the Department of Homeland Security’s budget. Still, a few made their own way, notably Sen. Lindsey Graham—who, at one session, said, “Who gives a shit who owns Greenland? I don’t.” (Too bad he couldn’t have summoned the courage to say that a month ago, when Trump threatened war over the question). A few politicians who are assumed to have presidential aspirations also managed to attend: Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer (who stressed the vital relations between her state and Canada), California Gov. Gavin Newsom (who proclaimed that his state still observed tight laws on greenhouse gases), and the aforementioned AOC.

AOC was the big curiosity, and the two panels where she spoke—one on populism, the other on U.S. foreign policy—were hot tickets. She had never been to the conference before. She was there to lay out a vision of an alternative, progressive foreign policy—and therein lay the mystery: What is a progressive foreign policy in the era of Trump?

A decade ago, progressives would have been, and still would be, anti-war, but would they now support NATO and the armament of Ukraine, if just to distinguish themselves from MAGA isolationists? And how would a progressive fit the U.S. into Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney’s assertion of “middle” nations’ power in his speech earlier this month at the Davos conference?

Before this weekend, I had never heard AOC speak at length, without a script, on foreign policy (or many other topics), and, following the panels streamed on YouTube, I found her for the most part impressive. She argued that income inequality fueled the resentment that triggered the rise of right-wing populism. She noted (as did Carney, though less pointedly) that the “rules-based order” has always excluded the poor from its benefits and the powerful from its obligations, and mused that, contrary to those who say we’re in a “post-rules-based order,” we might be in a “pre-rules-based order.” The real question, in any case, was “rules for whom.” She advocated a “working-class-centered” policy, in part for its own sake, in part to “stave off authoritarianism.” She supported firm commitment to allies, especially those that share our values on human rights and democracy, and adherence to treaties, regardless of whether Democrats or Republicans had signed them.

She didn’t quite explain what a “working-class” foreign policy might entail. (President Joe Biden talked about “a foreign policy for the middle class,” tying the idea to an industrial policy that let the U.S. compete with China in high tech; it’s unclear whether AOC would go there.) Nor did she address how a commitment to alliances would affect the balance between social spending and defense spending. In that realm, she (already famously) fumbled a question on whether she’d defend Taiwan from an attack (though, in fairness, the “strategic ambiguity” of U.S. policy on that question is confusing even to seasoned experts—she just hadn’t been briefed on the proper clichés to utter).

She still needs some seasoning in this sphere, but this was her first exposure, and she’s just 36 years old. She could acquire another 30 years of seasoning and still emerge younger than Trump was the first time he ran for president.

But just as Rubio revealed his true colors on his first stop after Munich, AOC made what could turn out to be her most enduring impression after the conference as well. Rubio stood alongside Europe’s most authoritarian leader, in Budapest. AOC met and spoke with some of its most prominent left-liberal leaders, in Berlin.

She spoke first to leaders of Germany’s Social Democratic Party/SPD and then to its Left Party/Die Linke—both full-house events, mainly about leftish issues, which they had rarely heard about from an American politician, especially one as prominent as AOC.

But apart from the issues, AOC stressed the importance of sticking together. Whatever they might try to accomplish, she said at the first event, the approach “has to be coalitional.”

We have to grow our ranks … because if we go separately, we will lose it all. … Everyone has something to give here, and that’s why I’m proud to meet with Die Linke tomorrow and to be here with SPD today, because we cannot let the right win.

This was a stern message to the two groups of German politicians, who have sharp divisions, despite knowing very well that, a century ago, similar divisions between social democrats and socialists abetted the rise of Hitler. Today, SPD and Die Linke together hold 19 and 10 percent of the seats in Germany’s parliament, respectively. The far-right-wing party, the AfD, holds 24 percent. (The centrist Christian Democratic Union holds 33 percent, and the Green Party holds 13 percent.) Together, the two left-leaning parties outflank AfD; apart, they can get crushed.

AOC is pursuing the same theme back in Washington. Back in 2018, when she was first elected as a Bernie Sanders–type democratic socialist, she formed a huddle with a few like-minded House members who called themselves the Squad. Now she is a power- and coalition-builder, even helping to raise money for centrist Democrats—who ask her for help, knowing that they need her constituents to push them over the edge, just as AOC knows she needs the moderates to push her agenda.

The U.S. probably hasn’t shifted quite left enough to elect AOC president in 2028. (It’s questionable whether she could even win upstate New York in a race for the Senate.) But domestic alliances are shifting, just as global alliances are shifting. In weighing the contestants for America’s top leadership positions, it’s worth noting that Trump, Rubio, and Vance endorse Orbán and the AdF—while AOC tries to unify the SPD and Die Linke.

Which of these sides should America be on?

Last week, a federal judge issued a temporary restraining order requiring Immigration and Customs Enforcement to allow reasonable time for detainees at the Whipple detention center in Minneapolis to access legal counsel. In a 41-page decision, Trump-appointed U.S. District Judge Nancy Brasel excoriated the government for policies and practices that “all but extinguish” a detainee’s right to counsel. On this week’s Amicus podcast, Dahlia Lithwick spoke to professor Linus Chan, the James H. Binger Clinical Professor of Law at the University of Minnesota and the faculty director of the Detainee Rights Clinic, where he represents people who are being detained by ICE or in danger of being detained by ICE.

Dahlia Lithwick: The Justice Department will likely appeal this order, but in the meantime, how much of a difference will this make for folks swept up by ICE in Minnesota, assuming they get 72 hours before being removed to Texas, per the new order? What kind of a difference will this make for clients like yours?

Linus Chan: It’s going to be a huge difference. But also, it’s just returning things to the status quo. And I will be frank, it’s not as if the status quo was a paragon of attorney access, but at the same time, there had always been an operative norm that detainees should be able to talk to their lawyers and not suddenly be transported out of state with no ability to let their loved ones know what’s going on, and even themselves maybe not knowing what’s going on. So this is really important.

Under the old processes, they would get detained, and then they would go through what’s called processing—they might have their biometrics done, there might be an interview with an officer to confirm information that they have in the system, and after that conversation, they would then be put in a holding area for a few hours, and then put into one of the county jails in Minnesota. Most of the time the person’s stay for detention would be either in Minnesota or around the Midwest.

One of the big departures in current practice from what it was in the past was that ICE’s logistical acumen has reached the point of arresting someone at, let’s say, 9:00 in the morning and having them on a plane by noon. It was working like clockwork. People were not going through that longer process I described. They were going very, very quickly, and they could find themselves suddenly in El Paso or New Mexico, most often in Texas because the detention capacity in Texas has grown a lot.

Now, let’s assume this is a client of yours. Even if you knew they were at the Bishop Whipple building, there was no easy way to contact them. If you went online to the detainee locator, a lot of the time it would say the person is in custody, but it would not tell you where they were. It would direct you to call ICE at this number. Of course I’ve done this, I’ve called the number, and nobody ever picks up. It’s just a dead number. So then you have no idea at all what’s going on, but you do know how quickly they have put people on an actual plane out of the country, and have done so even when they legally should not be able to.

On top of that, we have a Trump administration that says that even if they know that it was a mistake, they don’t have to correct that mistake. Once a person is no longer in U.S. custody, they say this is a foreign-power problem, and they don’t have any means to fix it if they are out of the country.

The biggest source of concern and trauma comes from family members who are trying to figure out whether their family member has been kidnapped or whether they’re in immigration detention, and they can’t find out for several hours. So the fact that we have this order that is both trying to make sure that there is attorney access as well as to slow that process down, of transfers, can be tremendously important and powerful. It also gets into another issue which was in terms of habeas access.

Do you want to talk about how that’s changed? Because it seems to me that’s a cornerstone. I think people glaze over because it seems hypertechnical, but this is really where the rubber meets the road.

Habeas, the great writ, is in our Constitution, it’s an English tradition that predates our country, and it’s the general idea that if the government wants to imprison someone, then at some point or another, they need to justify that imprisonment. And if that imprisonment violates any law, and in this case, the United States, violates the Constitution, then a court can order that person to be released.

The history of the writ of habeas corpus and immigration is a very long one. In fact, it goes all the way back to the Chinese exclusion cases, back in the 1860s, 1870s, 1880s, where the federal government was trying to exclude Chinese people from coming to the United States, even if in some cases they were U.S. citizens or had the proper documentation. The way that people would challenge the laws or challenge the policy was through the writ of habeas corpus. There was a period of time. before what’s called the administrative period, where the writ of habeas corpus was the only way to challenge an order of deportation. Let’s say you were ordered deported and you now faced banishment from your country. The only way to get a judge to look at it was to give a writ of habeas corpus.

In the intervening years, there’s been a shift that started most dramatically in the late 1990s, where Congress really did not want immigrants to file writs of habeas corpus to challenge removal orders. So they started to take away the ability of courts to do that. In 2005, there was passage of what’s called the Real ID Act, which was a post- 9/11 piece of legislation that came from this idea that the problem with immigration enforcement was too much review, that there was too much legal process. So they cut it off and basically said that no court can look at the lawfulness of immigration deportation orders, even through habeas, that there is one way, and the only way is through what’s called a circuit court review, having the federal appellate courts eventually review it. That was a huge dramatic change.

But it didn’t prevent people from arguing that their detention was unlawful, while it prevented people from arguing that their removal or their deportation order was unlawful. And that has become so important, because this administration is deliberately using detention as the tool and as the weapon to try to push as many people out as possible. And they are explicit about this. When the students were getting notices that suddenly their visas were being revoked, they were getting letters that said, By the way, if you don’t want to end up detained, you might want to leave now. On the CBP One Home app, they say, You don’t want to get detained, right? Go ahead and sign up to get $1,000 and leave. There’s a reason they are gleefully talking about all the money that they’re using to build detention camps, because it’s driving that.

When they expand detention, when they go back on the former norms, there’s only one way to actually get people to examine whether they could do those things or not, and that’s through the writ of habeas corpus. The writ of habeas corpus, as powerful as it is—and it is—has become more and more difficult to use thanks to layers of  legal doctrines lately.

One of them is what’s called the immediate custodian rule. That is, you can only file a habeas in the district court where they are actually being detained. When I referenced earlier how people didn’t know where they were going, how quickly they were getting transferred, that has become one of the controversies between litigants, the court, and Immigration and Customs Enforcement. I had this situation where a client of mine was detained one morning, and I filed habeas the next day—this is before it became clear how quickly out-of-state transfers were happening. I filed habeas, and looked my client up on the detainee locator. I couldn’t find her, her family didn’t know where she was, they couldn’t call her, no one knew where she was, and no one was picking up. This was a weekend. ICE had picked her up on Saturday. I filed the habeas corpus on Sunday. Their first reply to that habeas corpus was: You filed in the wrong court. By the time you filed it, she was already in Houston. The case in question, Rumsfeld v. Padilla, said you have to file habeas within the district of confinement, which meant that I was supposed to have filed it in Houston, even though I didn’t know where she was.

The conditions of detention and the scope of what is coming is the end in itself here, because the administration wants people to self-deport. What we are really seeing here is a weaponization of the detention itself. Detention has become the objective, and the crueler the detention, the bigger the win for this administration.

One of the things that’s always been remarkable, and I use the word remarkable because I kind of get stuck on these adjectives, is that as a child growing up as a Gen Xer, there was always this idea of freedom—the American view that we are a free country. If you look at what freedom means, it seems pretty axiomatic to think, Freedom means not being put in jail. But what I think has really become true generally in our society, and now more specifically with immigration, is that we’ve gotten so used to this idea that we can be detained, that we can be imprisoned, that there are all these justifications that the government has to imprison us.

It wasn’t until, I would argue, one of the most important decisions in the 1980s, which justified denying criminal bail to people, that really led to this idea that as long as the government says you’re a danger and you’re a flight risk, you are going to have to disprove it before you can be released. Even though the criminal system has a very important idea that the burden should be on the government, and not on the person being detained, and many immigration folks are trying to push the immigration system to more resemble that burden, if you speak to most on-the-ground criminal defense attorneys, it’s just words on a piece of paper. There has been an unfortunate acceptance of the idea that it’s OK to be detained.

Look at Minnesota, where they are arresting protesters or arresting observers, then they might spend eight hours or overnight, and then be released in negative-20-degree temperatures in the middle of a park without any of their possessions or their phone. That has happened. And then the government is not even bothering to charge them because they don’t think that they actually can make a good case. It’s just another example of how we’ve accepted as a society that when people get arrested, there must be good reason to do it. That’s amazing to me. Doesn’t that completely strike at the heart of us being a free country?

The fact that they could, as has happened here, literally break down the doors to our homes and arrest us without a warrant and then haul us in, and then the only thing we’ll get after they release us after several hours is not even an apology. It shouldn’t shock me but it does. They killed two people with witnesses and video recording in Minneapolis. They won’t apologize for that. So of course they’re not going to apologize for shooting a woman five times in Chicago. They’re not going to apologize for taking people and putting them in a cell for eight hours and then releasing them with no justification. They are not apologizing for the amount of trauma that they are imposing. They believe they’re unaccountable. That’s the thing that I think we really need to try to fix.

The United States government has begun construction of a multibillion-dollar detention camp system in the newest phase of Stephen Miller’s mass deportation strategy. The Department of Homeland Security has purchased two megawarehouses to be converted into 8,000-to-10,000-bed detention centers, with reported plans to buy and convert more than a dozen other warehouses for “processing” masses of new detainees. On this week’s Amicus podcast, Dahlia Lithwick discussed, with journalist Andrea Pitzer, the clear and chilling picture of what the Trump administration is building. Pitzer is the author of several books, including One Long Night: A Global History of Concentration Camps, and her most recent newsletter post is “Building the Camps: The Warehouseification of Detention and Initial Thoughts on Stopping It.” The following conversation has been edited and condensed for clarity.

Dahlia Lithwick: What is being built? At what speed is it being built? At what cost is it being built? How is it that we’re at the place where the language that you use in your post, concentration camps, actually is not just apt but has become fairly obvious?

Andrea Pitzer: The U.S. already had a pretty extensive immigration deportation system. In the first Trump administration, the White House wanted to prioritize the kinds of optics that signaled that it could go after anybody at any time. That led to a sort of a Keystone Cops approach, and so the numbers of people deported were in fact lower than under Barack Obama. But the optics of things like family separations and the deliberate cruelty were really apparent. The administration learned from that first outing that it needed to do more planning and be more strategic. Now that Donald Trump has returned to office, we’re still seeing a lot of Keystone Cops stuff that the administration probably didn’t intend for people to see, but we’re also seeing a lot of deliberate cruelty on the streets that it does intend for people to see.

Meanwhile, the White House is hoovering up warehouses. Before all these warehouse purchases, there was a turn toward facilities like Camp East Montana, which is this enormous facility that was stood up just last August within Fort Bliss, near El Paso, Texas. They were literally building it out with tents as they were bringing people in. They’ve decided that it doesn’t really meet their needs, and so they are now turning to acquiring these warehouses. There are over 100 the administration in the process of working toward. It’s spent about three-quarters of a billion dollars on buying these so far.

The infrastructure of all that is extraordinary. When you look at some of the biggest concentration camp systems across the world, we are actually approaching or ahead of the numbers for those massive famous ones. The Nazis came to power in 1933 and immediately, within weeks, had opened Dachau—which, I will note, was founded on a converted factory site—so we’re echoing this history right from the beginning. It was not until about five and a half years later, with Kristallnacht, that they started doing large sweeps of German Jews into camps. In that 48-hour period, more than 30,000 Jews were sent into concentration camps. That was five years into Nazi rule.

We are at the end of the first year of this second Trump administration. And even when you look at, let’s say, 1940 to 1941, World War II had started, Germany was putting a lot more people into camps, and yet we have more people in immigrant detention today than Nazi Germany did seven years into the Third Reich, which I think is just astounding when you think about it.

Even before he was elected, Trump was talking about this mass deportation campaign, that there were up to 20 million people in the United States illegally. Historians debate how many people moved through the Soviet gulag, whether it was 18 million or 20 million people in more than two decades who went through that system. What the Trump administration is talking about are those numbers in a four-year period. If you know anything about how horrific the Soviet gulag was, you’ll recall that it transformed the country for generations that followed, and it wrecked lives.

The Soviets didn’t know in advance what they were doing, but Stephen Miller has that context. That is something key people in the administration are openly embracing. We are already seeing conditions in those camps that rival early Nazi concentration camps, with illness, disease, and reports of limited access to medical care. We’ve had a killing in Camp East Montana that has been declared a homicide. People have already died.

This is not something this administration stumbles into sideways, right? This was the plan. Last April, acting ICE Director Todd Lyons was heard to say that what he really, really wanted to do was to just run deportations like a business: “Like Amazon Prime, but with human beings,” he said. We are witnessing the construction of a system for just warehousing people systematically. How much of what we are seeing playing out right now is just the tip of the iceberg for what is imagined?

If we look at that “Amazonification,” different concentration camps evolved over time in different ways. I often use the Nazi example because it’s almost the only concentration camp system people know, even though there have been a bunch of different ones. The Nazis were the very first who took this logistical approach that we think of as Amazonification now. There was a detainee named Margarete Buber-Neumann, who wrote an amazing memoir, Under Two Dictators. She was detained in the Soviet gulag system, then later held in the Nazi concentration camp system. The Soviets handed her over to the Gestapo at the beginning of World War II, and she describes coming to the Nazi camp system and being issued clothes and utensils to eat with. It was this whole system that was very sadistic, but it was incredibly scripted and organized. Of course, that went to hell once the war started, but this warehouse-ification of people was exactly the initial Nazi goal. The extermination of people through that warehouse system became the later explicit goal.

In terms of what our government is doing, I want to make clear: This can happen in a country only when things have been deeply wrong for a number of years in a number of ways. What we’ve already seen in the U.S., with prisons, with decades of demonizing immigrants, with the already existing nature of our punitive immigration system, where detention is literally used as a deterrent and to do harm to people—all that gives Trump these initial tools that they are clearly planning to expand on in tremendous ways.

People are waking up to what’s happening on the ground, which is amazing and offers all kinds of potential for things to do. But I don’t think people understand the scope of it. If they end up with all these warehouses, what automatically follows from that is you have transit camps and you have hub camps and you have whole communities whose identities become bound up with these warehouses. This is why we see some of these small towns and cities already working to reject the Immigration and Customs Enforcement warehouses. Dachau is the name of the town. Just think, for how many places in our country is that what is going to be meant by their names going forward?

According to the plans that we see from Miller and Trump, this will be as large as—and potentially even larger than—the U.S. prison system, which is already so much larger than almost anything else in the world. It will exist almost entirely outside the realm of oversight, of accountability. Concentration camp systems are always an end run around the existing legal system in a country at a given time. This isn’t just going to be criminal detainees. We’re already seeing people with documentation disappearing in this system, people who are here lawfully. We have seen U.S. citizens that have ended up in some of these settings. The goal is never to do detention against just the targeted group. The goal with these is always political: the expansion of political power and the entrenchment of political power. By definition, that means that other people will be going into these camps over time. The objective is really expanding and locking down control over public life in America. It is the ability to silence any kind of dissent.

Americans are waking up to the reality of horrifying dispatches from Camp East Montana, located near El Paso, Texas: reports of hunger, of violence, of sexual assault, of death. Who is accountable for this?

I think everybody involved has to run the risk of accountability. The sooner we can shut down the largest wave of this as it’s growing, the smaller that number will be. And it is better not only that less harm comes to people; even on the other side of this, the fewer people who will have to be held accountable in some way, the better it is for society. So even for the perpetrators, it is better if we can shut this down, but especially for the people that would have harm done to them.

It may be hard to imagine accountability in this moment, when so many systems are collapsing, but I think of the people I talked to in Argentina who had been tortured and held. In some cases, they had been sexually assaulted, their friends killed. There was never a hard end where the military made itself accountable there. The dictatorship ended, but there was never this moment of accountability. That came years later. One woman I interviewed remembered that while she was blindfolded, she was able to peek under her blindfold and see a tile pattern on the floor. When it came time to testify, they testified to everything that they could remember. Somebody went and found that tile pattern, and they found the floor, they found the house she had been held in, and they talked to the neighbors, and the neighbors recalled hearing the screams. They were able to work their way through these unbelievably difficult investigations to bring leading military figures to justice, but also people underneath them.

You have to, first of all, for PR purposes, make everybody think they’re going to be accountable for everything going forward. Then, in the end, on the other side of this, you decide how you deal with the small potatoes. But there is going to have to be some kind of accountability. It was a serious shame from the Obama era that this was not done when he came to power in early 2009, in the face of what had happened in the war on terror. The lack of accountability at that point has enabled much of what has followed. Obama’s not personally responsible as if he had launched the war on terror himself, but he bears some of that responsibility, because without those accountability moments, this is exactly where you end up.

Reforms are good, for sure, but if you’re focused on them, the correct response to Dachau was not better training for the guards. So we can talk about better training, and we can talk about standards, but that ultimately is not going to be what addresses this. Everybody needs to face accountability.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">China-linked attackers exploited a maximum-severity hardcoded-credential bug in Dell RecoverPoint for Virtual Machines as a zero-day since at least mid-2024. It&#39;s all part of a long-running effort to backdoor infected machines for long-term access, according to Google&#39;s Mandiant incident response team.

The US government and Google first warned about this campaign last year after detecting Brickstorm backdoors in dozens of critical US networks.

Dell disclosed and patched the critical flaw (CVE-2026-22769) on Tuesday – but noted that miscreants had found and exploited the bug before it issued a fix.

&quot;We have received a report of limited active exploitation of this vulnerability,&quot; a Dell spokesperson told The Register. &quot;Customers are urged to immediately implement one of the remediations detailed&quot; in the advisory.

According to Mandiant and the Google Threat Intelligence Group, which also published a security alert on Tuesday about the Dell zero-day, the suspected PRC-linked intruders exploited CVE-2026-22769 to deploy malware including Brickstorm and a separate backdoor tracked as Grimbolt, and in some cases replaced older Brickstorm binaries with Grimbolt, while also creating “Ghost NICs” on virtual machines to enable stealthy network pivoting.

&quot;Analysis of incident response engagements revealed that UNC6201, a suspected PRC-nexus threat cluster, has exploited this flaw since at least mid-2024 to move laterally, maintain persistent access, and deploy malware including Slaystyle, Brickstorm, and a novel backdoor tracked as Grimbolt,&quot; said Google threat hunters Peter Ukhanov, Daniel Sislo, Nick Harbour, John Scarbrough, Fernando Tomlinson, Jr, and Rich Reece.

Because the full scale of this campaign is unknown, we recommend that organizations previously targeted by Brickstorm look out for Grimbolt in their environments

When asked about the scope of exploitation, Mandiant Consulting manager Reece, who co-authored the report, said Mandiant knows of &quot;less than a dozen&quot; organizations affected by CVE-2026-22769. &quot;But because the full scale of this campaign is unknown, we recommend that organizations previously targeted by Brickstorm look out for Grimbolt in their environments,&quot; he told The Register.

While the earlier versions of the Brickstorm backdoor were written in Go, and later Rust, it appears the attacker replaced these binaries with Grimbolt in September 2025, according to Mandiant.

Grimbolt, written in C#, uses native ahead-of-time (AOT) compilation to translate programming language code into native machine code before the application runs. It&#39;s also packed with UPX, an executable packer that compresses the native binary files produced by AOT.

These features make the malware less likely to raise any flags via static analysis, and enhance performance on resource-constrained appliances.

Grimbolt also provides the same remote shell capability and uses the same command and control infrastructure as the earlier Brickstorm malware.

&quot;UNC6201 established Brickstorm and Grimbolt persistence on the Dell RecoverPoint for Virtual Machines by modifying a legitimate shell script named convert_hosts.sh to include the path to the backdoor,&quot; the Googlers reported. &quot;This shell script is executed by the appliance at boot time via rc.local.&quot;

Plus, they note, the IR team discovered the Dell zero-day while investigating a victim&#39;s environment that had been backdoored by Brickstorm and Grimbolt.

Security analysts spotted &quot;multiple web requests&quot; to vulnerable appliances using the username &quot;admin&quot; and directed to the installed Apache Tomcat Manager.

Dell RecoverPoint for Virtual Machines uses Apache Tomcat as its web server, and the security sleuths soon discovered that the attackers had been exploiting a hardcoded password in Apache Tomcat to then deploy a malicious WAR file containing a Slaystyle web shell.

&quot;This is considered critical as an unauthenticated remote attacker with knowledge of the hardcoded credential could potentially exploit this vulnerability leading to unauthorized access to the underlying operating system and root-level persistence.&quot;

Additionally, after abusing the bug to exploit the Dell appliances, UNC6201 then created &quot;ghost NICs&quot; – hidden, temporary network ports on existing virtual machines running on an ESXi server – to burrow deeper into victims&#39; VMware virtual infrastructure.

VMware did not immediately respond to The Register&#39;s inquiries.

The US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency and CrowdStrike both previously warned that Chinese attackers were targeting organizations&#39; VMware environments and using Brickstorm for persistent access.

&quot;State-sponsored actors are not just infiltrating networks,&quot; CISA&#39;s Nick Andersen, executive assistant director for cybersecurity, said in December. &quot;They&#39;re embedding themselves to enable long term access, disruption, and potential sabotage.&quot; ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Imagine using an AI to sort through your prescriptions and medical information, asking it if it saved that data for future conversations, and then watching it claim it had even if it couldn&#39;t. Joe D., a retired software quality assurance (SQA) engineer, says that Google Gemini lied to him and later admitted it was doing so to try and placate him.

Joe&#39;s interaction with Gemini 3 Flash, he explained, involved setting up a medical profile – he said he has complex post-traumatic stress disorder (C-PTSD) and legal blindness (Retinitis Pigmentosa). That&#39;s when the bot decided it would rather tell him what he wanted to hear (that the info was saved) than what he needed to hear (that it was not).

&quot;The core issue is a documented architectural failure known as RLHF Sycophancy (where the model is mathematically weighted to agree with or placate the user at the expense of truth),&quot; Joe explained in an email. &quot;In this case, the model&#39;s sycophancy weighting overrode its safety guardrail protocols.&quot;

When Joe reported the issue through Google&#39;s AI Vulnerability Rewards Program, Google said that behavior was out of scope and was not considered a technical vulnerability.

&quot;To provide some context, the behavior you&#39;ve described is one of the most common issues reported to the AI VRP,&quot; said the reply from Google&#39;s VRP. &quot;It is very frequent, especially for researchers new to AI VRP, to report these.&quot;

The rules state, &quot;Generating violative, misleading, or factually incorrect content within the attacker&#39;s own session (including standard &#39;jailbreaks&#39; and &#39;hallucinations&#39;)&quot; are non-qualifying issues and vulnerabilities. Google says these should be reported via product feedback channels rather than the AI VRP.

Joe said he reported the issue without any financial expectation.

&quot;My intent in using the VRP channel was to ensure the issue was formally logged and reviewed, rather than routed through general customer support,&quot; he said. &quot;I used the VRP system because submitting via standard support channels would likely not result in any action.&quot;

Joe provided The Register with a copy of his communication with Google&#39;s VRP and a transcript of Gemini&#39;s analysis of its interaction that he says accompanied the VRP report.

For Gemini and other AI models, hallucination isn&#39;t so much a bug as an unavoidable feature. As Google notes in its responsible AI documentation, &quot;Gemini models might lack grounding and factuality in real-world knowledge, physical properties, or accurate understanding. This limitation can lead to model hallucinations, where Gemini for Google Cloud might generate outputs that are plausible-sounding but factually incorrect, irrelevant, inappropriate, or nonsensical.&quot;

The question is: what responsibility does responsible AI entail?

&quot;The deception occurred while I was using Gemini to build a &#39;Prescription Profile&#39; for my medical team – a data table mapping my medication history against my neurological conditions,&quot; Joe said. &quot;The system was aware of C-PTSD, Retinitis Pigmentosa, and their relation to traumas and adverse drug reactions.&quot;

Gemini, he said, repeatedly claimed that it had &quot;verified and locked&quot; his medical data into its persistent memory. Joe had doubts about that.

&quot;As SQA, I challenged these claims as a technical impossibility within the current architecture,&quot; he said. &quot;The model eventually admitted it was lying about the &#39;save&#39; to &#39;placate&#39; me.&quot;

The transcript, taken from the Gemini browser interface following Joe&#39;s inquiry about the model&#39;s mendacity, contains passages like:

According to Joe, Gemini attempted further deception by fabricating a non-existent &quot;save verification&quot; feature to conceal its failure to save data.

&quot;Importantly, the system&#39;s &#39;confession&#39; or &#39;admission of lying&#39; in the logs was not a moment of self-awareness or some kind of &#39;gotcha!&#39;,&quot; Joe said. &quot;It was merely a secondary layer of placation. The model predicted that &#39;confessing&#39; would be the most &#39;agreeable&#39; next step to manage the user after being caught in a logic contradiction. It was still executing the same deceptive repair narrative to maintain the session.&quot;

Joe contends that Google has neglected to extend Gemini&#39;s self-harm safety classifiers to cover psychological triggers.

&quot;This leaves the user at the mercy of a &#39;sycophancy loop&#39; where the model prioritizes short-term comfort (telling the user what they want to hear, or what the model decides they should hear) over long-term safety (technical honesty),&quot; he said.

The fix, he argues, involves recalibrating Gemini&#39;s RLHF to ensure that sycophancy can never override a safety boundary and that potential mental trauma is given equal weight to self-harm risks in the model&#39;s safety mechanisms.

Asked to comment, a Google spokesperson pointed to the company&#39;s AI VRP rules. If the company offers more information, we&#39;ll update this story.®

            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2026/02/17/amazons_200_billion_capex_plan/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">In their recent earnings call, Amazon kinda blew the doors off of industry analyst (motto: &quot;we&#39;ll be wrong, then take it out on your stock&quot;) projections for their capex spend.

Specifically, analysts pulled some numbers out of their... hat, and decided that Amazon would end up spending $150 billion on CapEx for 2026. Amazon then proclaimed that it was going to be a lot closer to $200 billion (&quot;no worries, you only missed by the GDP of Croatia&quot;), and the industry spent the next two business weeks just beating the absolute stuffing out of their stock for it. How badly? Shares fell 11% after hours, then kept falling for nine straight sessions – the longest losing streak since 2006 – erasing more than $450 billion in market value. That&#39;s more than the entire market cap of most companies that analysts are supposedly experts at evaluating.

Folks more retail-attuned than I have made a lot of hay about how it&#39;s a repeat of Amazon&#39;s overinvestment in their &quot;shipping underpants to customers&quot; business during the pandemic, but I disagree.

A minute or two after I called it &quot;tilting at an AI windmill&quot; on the internet, Andy Jassy said on the record that this &quot;isn&#39;t some sort of quixotic top-line grab,&quot; which is exactly the kind of statement one makes when things are going super, super well.

But is it the death knell that the industry paints it as? I think not.

On the earnings call, Jassy said, &quot;If you look at the capital we&#39;re spending and intend to spend this year, it&#39;s predominantly in AWS. Some of it is for our core workloads, which are non-AI workloads, because they&#39;re growing at a faster rate than we anticipated. But most of it is in AI, and we just have a lot of growth and a lot of demand.&quot; AWS CEO Matt Garman went further in an interview: &quot;Even with all of this investment, my best estimation is we will be capacity constrained for the next couple of years. We will sell every single server and every single bit and we will wish that we had more.&quot; That&#39;s not &quot;we hope to find customers for all these GPUs, perhaps Santa Claus will deliver them,&quot; but rather &quot;we literally cannot build data centers fast enough to meet the screaming demand.&quot;

If you&#39;ll recall, among other things like &quot;being obnoxious to giant companies on the internet&quot; and &quot;leading a crusade against NAT Gateway pricing,&quot; I help very large companies negotiate their AWS contracts. To be more pointed, I&#39;m well positioned to call out nonsense when I see it, like the time AWS claimed its staff spent a lot of time optimizing customer bills.

In this case, what I&#39;m seeing is not &quot;AWS pushing GPUs to customers.&quot; It&#39;s &quot;their customers are taking all that AWS will give them and then clamoring for more.&quot;

In other words, I can confirm these claims. AWS isn&#39;t getting ahead of its skis here; customers are legitimately asking for all the GPUs they can get their hands on. When AWS can&#39;t deliver, they&#39;re forced to look elsewhere. It&#39;s not going to win me friends in some circles, but my customers don&#39;t particularly want to do business with neo-clouds; they&#39;re being forced to do so since they&#39;re the only game in town that can get them the hardware. In the fullness of time, this is likely to correct.

But this absolutely doesn&#39;t mean that AWS is out of the woods.

AWS and OpenAI last year signed a $38 billion deal, which is notable for several reasons. First, it&#39;s the smallest hyperscaler deal that OpenAI has signed, but the largest contract I&#39;ve ever seen AWS announce. Second, their press release explicitly calls out Nvidia GPUs and not AWS&#39;s own Trainium chips (motto: &quot;we&#39;ll give you more of the stuff you want if we can use you as a reference customer for these; please. We&#39;re begging you.&quot;), which is a strong indicator of the lack of serious interest from leading AI labs in AWS&#39;s homebrew silicon.

Then there&#39;s the part where Amazon is reportedly in talks to invest up to $50 billion in OpenAI – on top of the existing $8 billion it has in Anthropic, for whom it literally built an $11 billion data center. Nothing says &quot;coherent strategy&quot; quite like bankrolling two companies whose entire business model is to eat each other&#39;s lunch.

AWS is a serious company who signs serious contracts, whereas from all outward appearances OpenAI sends their corporate buyer out to dinner with vendors, where this person gets absolutely plastered and then proceeds to sign contracts they have no clear path toward being able to fulfill. That doesn&#39;t happen in a vacuum that constrains itself to one company; a hypothetical collapse is going to look a lot like contagion as everyone from Nvidia on down is impacted. What does AWS do when suddenly a swath of its customers not only aren&#39;t clamoring for GPUs, but aren&#39;t paying their bills?

If you take a look at the three hyperscalers, they all share a critical survival trait: a wildly profitable business that propped up their cloud divisions long enough for them to become viable in their own right. If AWS customers start defaulting, Amazon will still make money shipping dog toys and underpants to punters. Google will still be selling ads against search results and turning off beloved services. Microsoft will still be a law firm in a trench coat, playing stupid games with licensing. The neo-clouds, on the other hand, are one-trick ponies.

This is also where the &quot;it&#39;s just like the pandemic warehouse overbuild&quot; comparison falls apart. When Amazon overbuilt fulfillment capacity in 2020 and 2021, the warehouses were still useful – they just had too many of them. GPUs and AI-optimized data centers are a very different kind of asset. If the AI music stops and you&#39;re sitting on hundreds of billions of dollars of specialized infrastructure, you can&#39;t exactly repurpose it to ship underpants faster. The best-case scenario is a painful write-down; the worst case is that you&#39;ve built the world&#39;s most expensive space heaters.

So here&#39;s where I land. The $200 billion isn&#39;t insane, and it isn&#39;t a death knell. AWS has a $244 billion backlog (up 40% year over year), is growing at 24% on a $142 billion annual run rate, and is monetizing capacity as fast as they can bolt it to a rack and flip the circuit breaker. The demand is demonstrably real, and the analysts who projected $146 billion were, to use a technical term, wrong.

But that demand is real right now. The entire thesis rests on AI workloads continuing to grow at a pace that justifies half a trillion dollars in combined CapEx from just four companies in a single year. If you believe that AI is going to continue its current trajectory – that enterprises will keep finding ways to convert GPU cycles into business value – then Amazon is making the right call. The company has a track record of making bets that Wall Street hates for eighteen months and then look brilliant in retrospect. See: AWS itself, Prime, the fulfillment network, absolutely not the Fire Phone, etc.

If you believe that we&#39;re somewhere in the &quot;irrational exuberance&quot; phase of AI adoption, then Amazon is building the most expensive monument to hubris since Meta spent $46 billion trying to convince the world it wanted to attend meetings as a legless cartoon avatar.

My money, for what it&#39;s worth, is somewhere in between. The demand is real. The contracts are signed. But the gap between &quot;every enterprise is experimenting with AI&quot; and &quot;every enterprise is running production AI workloads at scale&quot; is a chasm that $200 billion worth of GPUs can&#39;t bridge on its own. Amazon will almost certainly be fine – they have the underpants business to fall back on. It&#39;s everyone else in the supply chain who should be losing sleep. ®

            <h2>Infosys bows to its master, signs deal with Anthropic</h2>
            <p><strong>The Register | 2026-02-17</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2026/02/17/anthropic_infosys_partnership/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Indian IT professionals worried about 72-hour workweeks might soon face the opposite concern, as Bengaluru-based outsourcing giant Infosys has partnered with Anthropic to bring agentic AI to telecommunications companies and other regulated industries.

Anthropic and Infosys announced their collaboration plans on Tuesday, describing agentic AI as a core focus of their partnership. According to Infosys CEO Salil Parekh, the pair wants to combine their respective domain expertise to give businesses around the world a shot at actually getting some returns on their AI investments.

&quot;Our collaboration with Anthropic marks a strategic leap toward advancing enterprise AI, enabling organizations to unlock value and become more intelligent, resilient, and responsible,&quot; Parekh said in a canned statement.

The deal will primarily involve integrating Anthropic&#39;s various Claude models and Claude Code with Infosys&#39; Topaz AI-powered business automation platform. According to Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei, Infosys engineers are already using Claude Code for some work, and the partnership between the pair will enable the outsourcing giant to extend its footprint into regulated industries.

&quot;There&#39;s a big gap between an AI model that works in a demo and one that works in a regulated industry—and if you want to close that gap, you need domain expertise,&quot; Amodei said. &quot;Infosys has exactly that kind of expertise.&quot;

The particular domains that Anthropic and Infosys intend to enter via their partnership, and the tasks they intend their new AI agents to perform, hint that a headcount bloodbath is on the horizon.

In the telecommunications space, the pair wants to use AI agents to modernize network operations, manage customers across their lifecycle with a provider, and &quot;improve service delivery,&quot; whatever that might mean. In the financial services space, Anthropic and Infosys want AI to detect and assess risk, take care of compliance reports, and &quot;deliver more personalized customer interactions,&quot; including through tailoring financial advice to a client&#39;s full account history and current market conditions.

The pair also wants Claude AI to help Infosys customers in the manufacturing and engineering spaces to speed up product design and simulation, and handle more code in software development. They also want AI to take on an increased enterprise operations role by automating routine work, &quot;like document summarization, status reporting, and review cycles.&quot; Sounds like shorthand for letting AI do a lot of what humans used to.

News that Infosys is leaning further into AI won&#39;t come as a surprise to El Reg readers – we reported last month that India&#39;s four largest outsourcing firms, including Infosys, had effectively slammed the brakes on hiring, even as they talked up productivity gains from increased use of AI in their operations.

Infosys, which does business in 59 countries around the world, has been leaning into AI just like its competitors, slashing roles across the company while simultaneously opening up more roles for AI experts to further their application of the technology.

Infosys shares have plunged to their lowest level in years recently as investors have soured on IT consultancy firms in the face of competition from AI firms like Anthropic. That said, the announcement did bump shares up more than 4 percent on Tuesday, so perhaps a little bubble-blowing magic can reverse the tide. ®

Dragos specializes in operational technology (OT) security, and as such, its customers include energy, water, manufacturing, transportation, and other critical industries. Unsurprisingly, these are key sectors for Chinese, Russian, and other government-linked cyber operatives to hack for espionage and warfare purposes.

In its yearly cybersecurity report, Dragos said state-sponsored crews haven&#39;t let up on their attempts to compromise America&#39;s critical infrastructure, with three new OT-focused threat groups joining the fray. This brings the total number worldwide to 26, and of these, 11 were active in 2025.

Additionally, an existing group that Dragos tracks as Voltzite and is &quot;highly correlated&quot; with Volt Typhoon, according to Dragos CEO Robert M. Lee, kept up its intrusion activities last year. This is the Beijing goon squad that the US government has accused of burrowing into critical American networks for years and readying destructive cyberattacks against those targets.

In 2025, Voltzite continued embedding its malware inside strategic American utilities &quot;to maintain long-term persistence,&quot; Lee said.

&quot;They [Voltzite] weren&#39;t just getting in and getting access - they were getting inside the control loop&quot; system that manages utilities&#39; industrial processes, Lee said in a briefing with reporters, adding that the PRC-backed crew&#39;s primary focus is causing future disruption.

Voltzite was embedded in that infrastructure for the purpose of taking it down

&quot;Nothing that they were taking was useful for intellectual property,&quot; Lee said. &quot;Everything they were doing and learning was only useful for disrupting or causing destruction at those sites. Voltzite was embedded in that infrastructure for the purpose of taking it down.&quot;

In one of these campaigns, the intruders compromised Sierra Wireless AirLink devices and used these to access US pipeline operations&#39; OT networks. Dragos observed Voltzite exfiltrating operational and sensor data, and said the level of access the intruders had to the OT networks allowed them to potentially manipulate control systems. They also accessed engineering workstations and stole configuration files and alarm data, which included information about how to force stop operations.

In another Voltzite-linked campaign, Dragos spotted the crew using the JDY botnet to scan for public-facing Internet Protocol (IP) address ranges and VPN appliances across energy, oil, gas, and defense sectors.

&quot;While no exploitation was confirmed during this phase, Dragos assesses with moderate confidence that the intent appeared to be pre-staging for future intrusions and exfiltration of operational data,&quot; according to the report.

One of the three new groups that Dragos began tracking last year - Sylvanite - serves as Voltzite&#39;s initial access broker, responsible for weaponizing vulnerabilities and then handing off this access to Voltzite for deeper OT intrusions.

&quot;Usually that indicates a government team and their national lab, or a government team and a contractor, or two different government agencies,&quot; Lee said.

Sylvanite exploits known vulnerabilities in internet-facing products from F5, Ivanti, and SAP to provide Voltzite access into electric power generation, transmission and distribution, water, sewage, and oil and gas organizations across North America, the UK, Europe, Asia and the Middle East.

&quot;They&#39;re finding edge-device vulnerabilities - the things that a contractor or remote worker would use to get into operations networks,&quot; Lee said. &quot;And within 48 hours of disclosure, they&#39;re reverse engineering [vulnerabilities] and hitting those devices.&quot;

A second group that emerged during 2025, Azurite, overlaps with China&#39;s Flax Typhoon and focuses on gaining long-term access to OT engineering workstations and exfiltrating operational files including network diagrams, alarm data, and process information for downstream capability development.

This group targets manufacturing, defense, automotive, electric power, oil and gas, and government organizations across the US, Europe, and the Asia-Pacific region.

Finally, the third new group, Pyroxene, overlaps with activity attributed to Imperial Kitten (aka APT35) - the cyber arm of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC).

Dragos spotted Pyroxene conducting &quot;supply chain-leveraged attacks targeting defense, critical infrastructure, and industrial sectors, with operations expanding from the Middle East into North America and Western Europe,&quot; according to the report.

One such intrusion involved collaboration between Pyroxene and a group Dragos tracks as Parisite, which functions as an initial access provider into critical infrastructure orgs.

Pyroxene typically uses recruitment-themed social engineering against targeted individuals, interacting with victims via fake social media profiles before delivering backdoors and other malware. In June 2025, Dragos said the group deployed data-wiping malware against &quot;multiple undisclosed organizations&quot; in Israel around the time of the military conflict between Iran, Israel, and the US.

Of course, China and Iran aren&#39;t the only nations targeting critical infrastructure in America and around the globe. Russia also poses a threat to Western water and utilities - along with any nations helping Ukraine in its ongoing war against the Kremlin&#39;s occupation.

Dragos does not attribute cyberattacks to any nations. However, earlier this year, it blamed the December 2025 cyberattacks against Poland&#39;s power grid on a group it tracks as Electrum. This group overlaps with Russia&#39;s GRU-run Sandworm offensive cyber unit - the crew behind the 2022 attack on a Ukrainian power facility and earlier wiper attacks that coincided with Russia&#39;s ground invasion of Ukraine in 2022.

In its new report, Dragos said that Kamacite serves as the initial access provider for Electrum, and it detailed a reconnaissance campaign that Kamacite carried out against vulnerable internet-exposed industrial devices in US water, energy, and manufacturing sectors between March and July 2025.

&quot;While Dragos found no evidence of successful exploitation during this period, the scope and precision of the scanning reveal a meaningful evolution in Kamacite&#39;s operational posture,&quot; the report said. ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Move over Intel and AMD — Meta is among the first hyperscalers to deploy Nvidia&#39;s standalone CPUs, the two companies revealed on Tuesday. Meta has already deployed Nvidia&#39;s Grace processors in CPU-only systems at scale and is working with the GPU slinger to field its upcoming Vera CPUs beginning next year.

Apart from a few scientific institutions, Nvidia&#39;s nearly three-year-old Grace CPUs have predominantly shipped as part of so-called &quot;Superchips&quot; which featured integrated Hopper and Blackwell GPUs onboard.

These are nothing new for Meta. The Social Network has previously deployed Nvidia&#39;s Grace-Hopper Superchips as part of its Andromeda recommender system and now plans to field &quot;millions&quot; of Nvidia GB300 and Vera Rubin Superchips, the companies said today.

What has changed is Meta is now using Nvidia&#39;s CPU-only Grace systems to power both general purpose and agentic AI workloads that don&#39;t require a GPU.

&quot;What we found is that Grace is an excellent backend datacenter CPU. It can actually deliver 2x the performance per watt on those back end workloads,&quot; Ian Buck, Nvidia&#39;s VP and General Manager of Hyperscale and HPC, said during a press briefing ahead of Tuesday&#39;s announcement. &quot;Meta has already had a chance to get on Vera and run some of those workloads, and the results look very promising.&quot;

As a refresher, Nvidia&#39;s Grace CPUs are equipped with 72 Arm Neoverse V2 cores clocked at up to 3.35 GHz. The chip is available in a standalone config with up to 480 GB of memory or two of the processors can be combined with up to 960 GB of LPDDR5x memory to form the Grace-CPU Superchip.

LPDDR5x isn&#39;t something you typically see in server platforms, but offers several advantages in terms of space and bandwidth. The Grace-CPU Superchip boasts up to 1 TB of memory bandwidth between the two dies.

Nvidia&#39;s Vera CPU, officially unveiled at CES earlier this year, boosts core counts to 88 custom Arm cores and adds support for simultaneous multi-threading, aka hyperthreading, and confidential computing functionality.

According to Nvidia, Meta will take advantage of the latter capability for private processing and AI features in its WhatsApp encrypted messaging service.

Meta&#39;s adoption of Nvidia CPUs runs counter to the broader industry, which has increasingly pivoted to custom Arm CPUs like Amazon&#39;s Graviton or Google&#39;s Axion.

Alongside Meta&#39;s new CPU deployments, the hyperscaler will deploy more Nvidia GPUs and Spectrum-X network, something we&#39;d kind of figured considering the tech titan&#39;s $115 billion to $135 billion capex target for 2026.

Nvidia is being rather tight-lipped about the scale of the expanded collab. However, El Reg understands the deal will contribute tens of billions to its bottom line. A little back-of-the-napkin math tells us that at north of $3.5 million per rack, a million GPUs works out to about $48 billion, which is a big number even for Nvidia. By way of comparison, the company earned $31.9 billion in net income on revenues of $57 billion in the quarter ended Oct. 26. It&#39;ll report Q4 earnings later this month.

Meta isn&#39;t just an Nvidia shop these days. The company has a not insignificant fleet of AMD Instinct GPUs humming away in its datacenters and was directly involved in the design of AMD&#39;s Helios rack systems, which are due out later this year.

Meta is widely expected to deploy AMD&#39;s competing rack systems, though no formal commitment has yet been made. ®

﻿Nvidia’s starting to sell AI CPUs for use by themselves for the first time.

Meta has struck a multiyear deal to expand its data centers with millions of Nvidia’s Grace and Vera CPUs and Blackwell and Rubin GPUs. While Meta has long been using Nvidia’s hardware for its AI products, this deal “represents the first large-scale Nvidia Grace-only deployment,” which Nvidia says will deliver “significant performance-per-watt improvements in [Meta’s] data centers.” The deal also includes plans to add Nvidia’s next-generation Vera CPUs to Meta’s data centers in 2027.

Meta is also working on its own in-house chips for running AI models, but according to the Financial Times, it has run into “technical challenges and rollout delays” with its chip strategy. Nvidia is also dealing with concerns about depreciation and chip-back loans used to finance AI buildouts, as well as the pressure of competition. CNBC notes that Nvidia’s stock dropped four percent after a November report about Meta considering using Google’s Tensor chips for AI, and late last year, AMD announced chip arrangements with both OpenAI and Oracle.

Nvidia and Meta did not disclose how much the deal cost, but this year’s AI spending from Meta, Microsoft, Google, and Amazon is estimated to cost more than the entire Apollo space program.

The network allegedly didn’t want to upset FCC chair Brendan Carr.

The Late Show host Stephen Colbert says CBS blocked him from broadcasting an interview with James Talarico, a Democratic representative from Texas. During his opening monologue on Monday night, Colbert says the network’s lawyers told him in “no uncertain terms” that he couldn’t have Talarico on the show, forcing him to post the interview on YouTube instead, hours after news broke that Anderson Cooper is leaving his position at the network as a 60 Minutes correspondent.

“He [Talarico] was supposed to be here, but we were told in no uncertain terms by our network’s lawyers, who called us directly, that we could not have him on the broadcast,” Colbert says. “Then I was told in some uncertain terms that not only could I not have him on, I could not mention me not having him on.”

CBS spokesperson Phil Gonzales provided The Verge with the same statement claiming Colbert was not blocked from broadcasting the interview that was given to Variety and other outlets, but refused to attribute it by name per The Verge’s background policy. Asked for a name, Gonzales wrote, “Respectfully, you don’t need to use the statement. We will keep that in mind next time verge as us to reply [sic].”

Colbert, whose late-night show comes to an end in May, cites the Federal Communications Commission’s equal time rule, which states radio and broadcast television shows must air competing political candidates for the same amount of time during an election. Talarico is currently campaigning for a spot in the Senate.

As noted by Deadline, news interviews have long been exempt from this rule, with talk shows seemingly included under this umbrella. But in January, FCC Chair Brendan Carr issued new guidance suggesting late-night and daytime talk shows should comply with the rule as well. “If you’re fake news, you’re not going to qualify for the bona fide news exemption,” Carr said at the time.

Colbert says Carr “hasn’t done away” with the exemption yet, but CBS “is unilaterally enforcing it as if he had.” Last year, Paramount appointed The Free Press founder Bari Weiss as the editor-in-chief of CBS News. “Let’s just call this what it is. Donald Trump’s administration wants to silence anyone who says anything bad about Trump on TV.”

Update, February 17th: Added details regarding the statement from CBS.

Apple’s latest laptops are all receiving some kind of discount right now, as is the Mac Mini.

If you buy something from a Verge link, Vox Media may earn a commission. See our ethics statement.

Apple currently sells MacBooks equipped with its own M-series processors in a wide range of sizes and price points, all of which run the company’s newest operating system, macOS 26. Purchasing a new MacBook can be complicated if you’re trying to figure out what specs you need, but finding a deal on a relatively speedy model is surprisingly easy, especially since Apple increased the starting RAM on several models in late 2024 and hasn’t stopped.

These days, it’s not uncommon to see various MacBooks discounted by up to $800, although the quality of deals fluctuates frequently. Alternatively, purchasing refurbished options directly from Apple is another way to save money without waiting for the changing deal winds to blow your way. It’s also the only option to find certain configurations of older models as Apple continues to move forward with newer releases. Apple’s refurbished store offers a one-year warranty and generally discounts new units by up to 20 percent.

But if you want to buy new and you’re looking to save whatever you can, here are the best MacBook Air, MacBook Pro, and Mac Mini deals available.

In March 2025, Apple released an updated MacBook Air, which comes in both a 13- and 15-inch configuration with an M4 processor. Interestingly, the latest Air starts at a lower price than the prior model, yet it offers slightly faster performance and twice as much base RAM at 16GB. It can also connect to two external monitors with the lid open, comes in a fresh sky blue color, and features the 12-megapixel Center Stage webcam from the latest MacBook Pro. Needless to say, there’s a lot to like.

The 13- and 15-inch MacBook Airs have both previously received sizable discounts, though there aren’t any notable deals happening right now. That said, you can pick up the 13-inch base model with a 10-core CPU, an eight-core GPU, 16GB of RAM, and 256GB of storage on sale at Amazon for $849.99 ($150 off) in most color options. The lowest price we’ve seen for this model takes $200 off the original cost. If you prefer the larger 15-inch model, the entry-level configuration with a 10-core CPU, 10-core GPU, 16GB of RAM, and 256GB of storage is on sale for $1,049 ($150 off) at Amazon and B&H Photo, which is decent but not as good as the $999 sale price that was around for months.

The 14- and 16-inch MacBook Pro models with M4 Pro and M4 Max chips launched with a big increase in RAM over the previous generation, bringing them up to 24GB. They start with 512GB of storage, too, and retail for $1,999 and $2,499, respectively. While the total port selection hasn’t changed compared to their respective M3 Pro and M3 Max counterparts, you’ll get faster Thunderbolt 5 ports on these more substantial models. That’s in addition to the SD slot, dedicated full-sized HDMI port, and 3.5mm jack. They also have the upgraded 12-megapixel Center Stage webcam with Desk View, as well as the optional nano-texture display option.

As of right now, the M4 Pro-equipped MacBook Pro is the only model receiving significant discounts. For example, the 14-inch M4 Pro with a 12-core CPU, 16-core GPU, 24GB of RAM, and 512GB of storage is available at Amazon and B&H Photo starting at $1,799 ($200 off). It’s a solid discount, even if it’s not the biggest price drop we’ve seen in recent months.

The base 16-inch MacBook Pro, meanwhile, is available with an M4 Pro chip, 24GB of RAM, and 512GB of storage for $2,379 at Amazon, which isn’t great compared to previous deals.

Apple’s latest revision of the 14.2-inch MacBook Pro adds the M5 processor. The generational leap will be felt most by those who have an older MacBook Pro, not those upgrading from the M4, unless you use specific AI apps that tap into the chip’s new Neural Accelerators. As for other design changes and upgrades to the inside and outside of this MacBook Pro, there really aren’t any major ones to note; in fact, it’s so similar to the M4 model that our reviewer Antonio Di Benedetto had to write “M5” on a sticky note just to be able to tell them apart. That being said, it’s still an amazing laptop, one that’s just now starting to get minor discounts.

The 14.2-inch base model with the M5 processor, 16GB of RAM, and 512GB of storage is down to $1,449 ($150 off) at Amazon and B&H Photo, which is $100 shy of its best price to date. It’s worth picking over the M4 MacBook Pro, especially since that model is tough to find in stock and, more importantly, currently costs more than the newer, better version.

The newest Mac Minis in town are the M4-based models, which arrived in 2024. Apple reduced the desktop’s horizontal footprint and paired it with its M4 chipset and 16GB of RAM, which is double that of the previous generation and brings it in line with other base-model Macs from 2024. That makes Apple’s newest desktop computer a tremendous value.

Deals on the newest Mac Mini are a bit easier to come by now than they were at launch. The M4 Mac Mini starts with an M4 processor, 16GB of RAM, and 256GB of storage for $599. That’s an incredible value for a tiny desktop computer that can rival the Mac Studio and Mac Pro when it comes to certain tasks, including light gaming, 4K video editing, and 3D modeling. The M4 Mac Mini is a fair bit thicker than the last-gen M2 model at 2 inches tall, yet it measures a mere 5 inches wide and 5 inches deep.

In addition to the odd decision to place the power button on its underside, Apple moved the 3.5mm headphone jack and two of its five USB-C / Thunderbolt 4 ports to the front. The rear features an additional three Thunderbolt ports, HDMI-out, and a gigabit ethernet port. You can also get the Mac Mini with an M4 Pro chipset starting at $1,399, which comes with faster Thunderbolt 5 storage and the option to upgrade to 10-gigabit ethernet for another $100.

In the past, we’ve seen the base Mac Mini drop to as low as $469, but right now, the sales aren’t particularly noteworthy. It’s on sale at Amazon and B&H Photo with an M4 chip, 16GB of RAM, and a 256GB SSD for around $569 ($30 off). If you need more storage, you can step up to the version with 16GB of RAM and a 512GB SSD for $743 ($57 off) at Amazon and $749 at B&H Photo. Meanwhile, the base M4 Pro model with 24GB of RAM and 512GB of storage is on sale for $1,301 ($99 off) at Amazon.

Links in AI Overviews and AI Mode will appear in a pop-up upon hovering over cited sources.

Google says it will now display links more prominently inside its AI-powered features in Search. Robby Stein, the vice president of Google Search, announced on Tuesday that a list of links will now appear inside a pop-up when you hover over the sources in AI Overviews and AI Mode on desktop, alongside a description of each linked article and accompanying images.

Stein adds that Google will also show these “more descriptive and prominent link icons” in its AI responses on desktop and mobile. “Our testing shows this new UI is more engaging, making it easier to get to great content across the web,” Stein writes.

While AI Overviews appear as an AI-generated summary at the top of Search, AI Mode offers a chatbot-style search experience that lets you look for information without having to navigate to the original online sources. Google only continues to expand on these features, amid concerns that its AI search results are tanking traffic to news publishers and other websites. The company has defended its changes to Search, but admitted the open web is in “rapid decline.”

Last year, the European Commission also began investigating the company’s AI search features, including whether Google violated competition rules by using content from digital publishers in its AI responses without “appropriate compensation.” Google has since said that it’s “exploring” allowing publishers to opt out of appearing in its AI search features, and also started linking to more sources in AI Mode.

If you’re looking for a great pair of noise-canceling headphones, Sony’s WH-1000XM6 are amongst the best available and are now down to $368 ($92 off) at Amazon in black or gray. While their high price usually makes them harder for us to suggest over the last-gen model, which is often on sale for around $278.99, today’s deal makes the XM5 much easier to recommend. Just note the deal is expected to end around 10:50PM ET.

Sony’s flagship headphones build upon their predecessor with a new chip that powers the company’s most powerful active noise cancellation yet, making them even better at blocking out background sounds like traffic on busy streets. They boast new drivers, delivering detailed, bass-rich sound with adjustable EQ. Voice call performance is improved as well, so you sound clearer on calls.

In terms of design, they’re once again foldable like the XM4, making them easier to toss into a backpack or carry-on. Sony also widened the headband with removable ear cups, so they feel more comfortable during long listening sessions. Battery life is rated at up to 30 hours with ANC on, and you can even charge them while listening, though you’ll need both a 3.5mm cable to listen to music and a second USB-C for charging.

Metroid Prime 4: Beyond launched on the Nintendo Switch and Switch 2 in December, but if you’re itching for some more lore, Metroid Prime 1–3: A Visual Retrospective is a nice way to dig in, especially now that it’s on sale. Normally $49.99, you can currently buy the hardcover version for $41.08 (about $9 off) at Amazon and Walmart, which is one of the first discounts we’ve seen on the tabletop book.

Developed in collaboration with Nintendo and Retro Studios, Piggyback’s 210-page retrospective is an excellent homage to the last 20 years of Metroid. The book itself resembles a piece of art, stitched-bound in a canvas-like cloth hardcover, with a red embossed outline of the series’ iconic protagonist, Samus Aran. Inside, you’ll find a trove of concept drawings and sketches spanning the entire trilogy — as well as Metroid Prime Remastered — including detailed illustrations of environments, common enemies, and bosses. It even features concept art that never made it into the final games.

What really makes the book stand out are the behind-the-scenes stories, however. It touches on everything from Retro Studios’ burnout upon shipping Metroid Prime 2: Echoes to insights surrounding Nintendo’s secretive development process. The margin notes from series producer Kensuke Tanabe are especially entertaining, as they reveal design debates from over two decades ago.

The curious case of the disappearing Lamborghinis

Across the world, unsuspecting people are unwittingly becoming caught up in a new and growing type of organized criminal enterprise: vehicle transport fraud and theft.Crooks use email phishing, fraudulent paperwork, and other tactics to impersonate legitimate transport companies and get hired to deliver a luxury vehicle. They divert the shipment away from its intended destination before using a mix of technology, computer skills, and old-school techniques to erase traces of the vehicle’s original ownership and registration. In some cases, the car has been resold or is out of the country by the time the rightful owner even realizes it’s missing.The nationwide epidemic of vehicle transport fraud and theft has remained under the radar, even as it’s rocked the industry over the past two years. MIT Technology Review identified more than a dozen cases involving high-end vehicles, obtained court records, and spoke to law enforcement, brokers, drivers, and victims in multiple states to reveal how transport fraud is wreaking havoc across the country.

The scientist using AI to hunt for antibiotics just about everywhere

Antimicrobial resistance is a major problem. Infections caused by bacteria, fungi, and viruses that have evolved ways to evade treatments are now associated with more than 4 million deaths per year, and a recent analysis predicts that number could surge past 8 million by 2050.

Bioengineer and computational biologist César de la Fuente has a plan. His team at the University of Pennsylvania is training AI tools to search genomes far and deep for peptides with antibiotic properties. His vision is to assemble those peptides—molecules made of up to 50 amino acids linked together—into various configurations, including some never seen in nature. The results, he hopes, could defend the body against microbes that withstand traditional treatments—and his quest has unearthed promising candidates in unexpected places. Read the full story.

The quest to find out how our bodies react to extreme temperaturesClimate change is subjecting vulnerable people to temperatures that push their limits. In 2023, about 47,000 heat-related deaths are believed to have occurred in Europe. Researchers estimate that climate change could add an extra 2.3 million European heat deaths this century. That’s heightened the stakes for solving the mystery of just what happens to bodies in extreme conditions.While we broadly know how people thermoregulate, the science of keeping warm or cool is mottled with blind spots. Researchers around the world are revising rules about when extremes veer from uncomfortable to deadly. Their findings change how we should think about the limits of hot and cold—and how to survive in a new world. Read the full story.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">When Sam Zahr first saw the gray Rolls-Royce Dawn convertible with orange interior and orange roof, he knew he’d found a perfect addition to his fleet. “It was very appealing to our clientele,” he told me. As the director of operations at Dream Luxury Rental, he outfits customers in the Detroit area looking to ride in style to a wedding, a graduation, or any other event with high-end vehicles—Rolls-Royces, Lamborghinis, Bentleys, Mercedes G-Wagons, and more.

But before he could rent out the Rolls, Zahr needed to get the car to Detroit from Miami, where he bought it from a used-car dealer.

His team posted the convertible on Central Dispatch, an online marketplace that’s popular among car dealers, manufacturers, and owners who want to arrange vehicle shipments. It’s not too complicated, at least in theory: A typical listing includes the type of vehicle, zip codes of the origin and destination, dates for pickup and delivery, and the fee. Anyone with a Central Dispatch account can see the job, and an individual carrier or transport broker who wants it can call the number on the listing.

Zahr’s team got a call from a transport company that wanted the job. They agreed on the price and scheduled pickup for January 17, 2025. Zahr watched from a few feet away as the car was loaded into an enclosed trailer. He expected the vehicle to arrive in Detroit just a few days later—by January 21.

Zahr called a contact at the transport company to ask what happened.

“He’s like, I don’t know what you’re talking about.”

Zahr told me his contact angrily told him they mostly ship Coca-Cola products, not luxury cars. “He was yelling and screaming about it,” Zahr said.

Over the years, people have broken into his business to steal cars, or they’ve rented them out and never come back. But until this day, he’d never had a car simply disappear during shipping. He’d expected no trouble this time around, especially since he’d used Central Dispatch—“a legit platform that everyone uses to transport cars,” he said.

“That’s the scary part about it, you know?”

Zahr had unwittingly been caught up in a new and growing type of organized criminal enterprise: vehicle transport fraud and theft. Crooks use email phishing, fraudulent paperwork, and other tactics to impersonate legitimate transport companies and get hired to deliver a luxury vehicle. They divert the shipment away from its intended destination and then use a mix of technology, computer skills, and old-school chop shop techniques to erase traces of the vehicle’s original ownership and registration.

These vehicles can be retitled and resold in the US or loaded into a shipping container and sent to an overseas buyer. In some cases, the car has been resold or is out of the country by the time the rightful owner even realizes it’s missing.

“Criminals have learned that stealing cars via the web portals has become extremely easy, and when I say easy—it’s become seamless,” says Steven Yariv, the CEO of Dealers Choice Auto Transport of West Palm Beach, Florida, one of the country’s largest luxury-vehicle transport brokers.

Individual cases have received media coverage thanks to the high value of the stolen cars and the fact that some belong to professional athletes and other celebrities. In late 2024, a Lamborghini Huracán belonging to Colorado Rockies third baseman Kris Bryant went missing en route to his home in Las Vegas; R&B singer Ray J told TMZ the same year that two Mercedes Maybachs never arrived in New York as planned; and last fall, NBA Hall of Famer Shaquille O’Neal had a $180,000 custom Range Rover stolen when the transport company hired to move the vehicle was hacked. “They’re saying they think it’s probably in Dubai by now, to be honest,” an employee of the company that customized the SUV told Shaq in a YouTube video.

“Criminals have learned that stealing cars via the web portals has become extremely easy, and when I say easy—it’s become seamless.”

But the nationwide epidemic of vehicle transport fraud and theft has remained under the radar, even as it’s rocked the industry over the past two years. MIT Technology Review identified more than a dozen cases involving high-end vehicles, obtained court records, and spoke to law enforcement, brokers, drivers, and victims in multiple states to reveal how transport fraud is wreaking havoc across the country.

It’s challenging to quantify the scale of this type of crime, since there isn’t a single entity or association that tracks it. Still, these law enforcement officials and brokers, as well as the country’s biggest online car-transport marketplaces, acknowledge that fraud and theft are on the rise.

When I spoke with him in August, Yariv estimated that around 8,000 exotic and high-end cars had been stolen since the spring of 2024, resulting in over $1 billion in losses. “You’re talking 30 cars a day [on] average is gone,” he said.

Multiple state and local law enforcement officials told MIT Technology Review that the number is plausible. (The FBI did not respond to a request for an interview.)

“It doesn’t surprise me,” said J.D. Decker, chief of the Nevada Department of Motor Vehicles’ police division and chair of the fraud subcommittee for the American Association of Motor Vehicle Administrators. “It’s a huge business.”

Data from the National Insurance Crime Bureau (NICB), a nonprofit that works with law enforcement and the insurance industry to investigate insurance fraud and related crimes, provides further evidence of this crime wave. NICB tracks both car theft and cargo theft, a broad category that refers to goods, money, or baggage that is stolen while part of a commercial shipment; the category also covers cases in which a vehicle is stolen via a diverted transport truck or a purloined car is loaded into a shipping container. NICB’s statistics about car theft show that it has declined following an increase during the pandemic—but over the same period cargo theft has dramatically increased, to an estimated $35 billion annually. The group projected in June that it was expected to rise 22% in 2025.

NICB doesn’t break out data for vehicles as opposed to other types of stolen cargo. But Bill Woolf, a regional director for the organization, said an antifraud initiative at the Port of Baltimore experienced a 200% increase from 2023 to 2024 in the number of stolen vehicles recovered. He said the jump could be due to the increased effort to identify stolen cars moving through the port, but he noted that earlier the day we spoke, agents had recovered two high-end stolen vehicles bound for overseas.

“One day, one container—a million dollars,” he said.

Many other vehicles are never recovered—perhaps a result of the speed with which they’re shipped off or sold. Travis Payne, an exotic-car dealer in Atlanta, told me that transport thieves often have buyers lined up before they take a car: “When they steal them, they have a plan.”

In 2024, Payne spent months trying to locate a Rolls-Royce he’d purchased after it was stolen via transport fraud. It eventually turned up in the Instagram feed of a Mexican pop star, he says. He never got the car back.

The criminals are “gonna keep doing it,” he says, “because they make a couple phone calls, make a couple email accounts, and they get a $400,000 car for free. I mean, it makes them God, you know?”

The explosion of vehicle transport fraud follows a pattern that has played out across the economy over the past roughly two decades: A business that once ran on phones, faxes, and personal relationships shifted to online marketplaces that increased efficiency and brought down costs—but the reduction in human-to-human interaction introduced security vulnerabilities that allowed organized and often international fraudsters to enter the industry.

In the case of vehicle transport, the marketplaces are online “load boards” where car owners, dealerships, and manufacturers post about vehicles that need to be shipped from one location to another. Central Dispatch claims to be the largest vehicle load board and says on its website that thousands of vehicles are posted on its platform each day. It’s part of Cox Automotive, an industry juggernaut that owns major vehicle auctions, Autotrader, Kelley Blue Book, and other businesses that work with auto dealers, lenders, and buyers.

The system worked pretty well until roughly two years ago, when organized fraud rings began compromising broker and carrier accounts and exploiting loopholes in government licensing to steal loads with surprising ease and alarming frequency.

A theft can start with a phishing email that appears to come from a legitimate load board. The recipient, a broker or carrier, clicks a link in the message, which appears to go to the real site—but logging in sends the victim’s username and password to a criminal. The crook logs in as the victim, changes the account’s email and phone number to reroute all communications, and begins claiming loads of high-end vehicles. Cox Automotive declined an interview request but said in a statement that the “load board system still works well” and that “fraud impacts a very small portion” of listings.

“Every time we come up with a security measure to prevent the fraudster, they come up with a countermeasure.”

Criminals also gain access to online marketplaces by exploiting a lax regulatory environment. While a valid US Department of Transportation registration is required to access online marketplaces, it’s not hard for bad actors to register sham transport companies and obtain a USDOT number from the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration, the agency that regulates commercial motor vehicles. In other cases, criminals compromise the FMCSA accounts of legitimate companies and change their phone numbers and email addresses in order to impersonate them and steal loads. (USDOT did not respond to a request for comment.)

As Bek Abdullayev, the founder of Super Dispatch, one of Central Dispatch’s biggest competitors, explained in an episode of the podcast Auto Transport Co-Pilot, “FMCSA [is] authorizing people that are fraudulent companies—people that are not who they say they are.” He added that people can “game the system and … obtain paperwork that makes [them] look like a legitimate company.” For example, vehicle carrier insurance can be obtained quickly—if temporarily—by submitting an online application with fraudulent payment credentials.

The bottom line is that crooks have found myriad ways to present themselves as genuine and permitted vehicle transport brokers and carriers. Once hired to move a vehicle, they often repost the car on a load board using a different fraudulent or compromised account. While this kind of subcontracting, known as “double-­brokering,” is sometimes used by companies to save money, it can also be used by criminals to hire an unwitting accomplice to deliver the stolen car to their desired location. “They’re booking cars and then they’re just reposting them and dispatching them out to different routes,” says Yariv, the West Palm Beach transport broker.

“A lot of this is cartel operated,” says Decker, of the Nevada DMV, who also serves on a vehicle fraud committee for the International Association of Chiefs of Police. “There’s so much money in it that it rivals selling drugs.”

Even though this problem is becoming increasingly well known, fraudsters continue to steal, largely with impunity. Brokers, auto industry insiders, and law enforcement told MIT Technology Review that load boards and the USDOT have been too slow to catch and ban bad actors. (In its statement, Cox Automotive said it has been “dedicated to continually enhancing our processes, technology, and education efforts across the industry to fight fraud.”)

Jake MacDonald, who leads Super Dispatch’s fraud monitoring and investigation efforts, put it bluntly on the podcast with Abdullayev: the reason that fraud is “jumping so much” is that “the industry is slowly moving over to a more technologically advanced position, but it’s so slow that fraud is actually [out-]innovating the industry.”

As it turns out, the person Zahr’s team hired on Central Dispatch didn’t really work for the transport company.

After securing the job, the fraudster reposted the orange-and-gray Rolls convertible to a load board. And instead of saying that the car needed to go from Miami to the real destination of Detroit, the new job listed an end point of Hallandale Beach, Florida, just 20 or so miles away. It was a classic case of malicious double-­brokering: the crooks claimed a load and then reposted it in order to find a new, unsuspecting driver to deliver the car into their possession.

On January 17 of last year, the legitimate driver showed up in a Dodge Ram and loaded the Rolls into an enclosed trailer as Zahr watched.

“The guy came in and looked very professional, and we took a video of him loading the car, taking pictures of everything,” Zahr told me. He never thought to double-­check where the driver was headed or which company he worked for.

Not long after a panicked Zahr spoke with his contact at the transport company he thought he was working with, he reported the car as stolen to the Miami police. Detective Ryan Chin was assigned to the case. It fit with a pattern of high-end auto theft that he and his colleagues had recently been tracking.

“Over the past few weeks, detectives have been made aware of a new method on the rise for vehicles being stolen by utilizing Central Dispatch,” Chin wrote in records obtained by MIT Technology Review. “Specific brokers are re-routing the truck drivers upon them picking up vehicles posted for transport and routing them to other locations provided by the broker.”

Chin used Zahr’s photos and video to identify the truck and driver who’d taken the Rolls. By the time police found him, on January 31, the driver had already dropped off Zahr’s Rolls in Hallandale Beach. He’d also picked up and delivered a black Lamborghini Urus and a White Audi R8 for the same client. Each car had been stolen via double-brokering transport fraud, according to court records.

The police department declined to comment or to make Chin available for an interview. But a source with knowledge of the case said the driver was “super cooperative.” (The source asked not to be identified because they were not authorized to speak to the media, and the driver does not appear to have been identified in court records.)

The driver told police that he had another load to pick up at a dealership in Naples, Florida, later that same day—a second Lamborghini Urus, this one orange. Police later discovered it was supposed to be shipped to California. But the carrier had been hired to bring the car, which retails for about $250,000, to a mall in nearby Aventura. He told police that he suspected it was going to be delivered to the same person who had booked him for the earlier Rolls, Audi, and Lamborghini deliveries, since “the voice sounds consistent with who [the driver] dealt with prior on the phone.” This drop-off was slated for 4 p.m. at the Waterways Shoppes mall in Aventura.

That was when Chin and a fellow detective, Orlando Rodriguez, decided to set up a sting.

The officers and colleagues across three law enforcement agencies quickly positioned themselves in the Waterways parking lot ahead of the scheduled delivery of the Urus. They watched as, pretty much right on schedule that afternoon, the cooperative driver of the Dodge Ram rolled to a stop in the palm-tree-lined lot, which was surrounded by a kosher supermarket, Japanese and Middle Eastern restaurants, and a physiotherapy clinic.

The driver went inside the trailer and emerged in the orange Lamborghini. He parked it and waited near the vehicle.

Roughly 30 minutes later, a green Rolls-Royce Cullinan (price: $400,000 and up) arrived with two men and a teenager inside. They got out, opened the trunk, and sat on the tailgate of the vehicle as one man counted cash.

“They’re doing countersurveillance, looking around,” the source told me later. “It’s a little out of the ordinary, you know. They kept being fixated [on] where the truck was parked.”

The transport driver and the three males who arrived in the Rolls-Royce did not interact. But soon enough, another luxury vehicle, a Bentley Continental GT, which last year retailed for about $250,000 and up, pulled in. The Bentley driver got out, took the cash from one of the men sitting on the back of the Rolls, and walked over to the transport driver. He handed him $700 and took the keys to the Lamborghini.

That’s when more than a dozen officers swooped in.

“They had nowhere to go,” the source told me. “We surrounded them.”

The two men in the Rolls were later identified as Arman Gevorgyan and Hrant Nazarian, and the man in the Bentley as Yuriy Korotovskyy. The three were arrested and charged with dealing in stolen property, grand theft over $100,000, and organized fraud. (The teenager who arrived in the Rolls was Gevorgyan’s son. He was detained and released, according to Richard Cooper, Gevorgyan’s attorney.)

As investigators dug into the case, the evidence suggested that this was part of the criminal pattern they’d been following. “I think it’s organized,” the source told me.

It’s something that transport industry insiders have talked about for a while, according to Fred Mills, the owner of Florida-based Advantage Auto Transport, a company that specializes in transporting high-end vehicles. He said there’s even a slang term to describe people engaged in transport fraud: the flip-flop mafia.

It has multiple meanings. One is that the people who show up to transport or accept a vehicle “are out there wearing, you know, flip-flops and slides,” Mills says.

The second refers to how fraudsters “flip” from one carrier registration to another as they try to stay ahead of regulators and complaints.

In addition to needing a USDOT number, carriers working across states need an interstate operating authority (commonly known as an MC number) from the USDOT. Both IDs are typically printed on the driver and passenger doors. But the rise of ­double-brokering—and of fly-by-night and fraudulent carriers—means that drivers increasingly just tape IDs to their door.

Mills says fraudsters will use a USDOT number for 10 or 11 months, racking up violations, and then tape up a new one. “They just wash, rinse, and repeat,” he says.

Decker from the Nevada DMV says a lot of high-end vehicles are stolen because dealerships and individual customers don’t properly check the paperwork or identity of the person who shows up to transport them.

“‘Flip-flop mafia’ is an apt nickname because it’s surprisingly easy to get a car on a truck and convince somebody that they’re a legitimate transport operation when they’re not,” he says.

Roughly a month after it disappeared, Zahr’s Rolls-Royce was recovered by the Miami Beach Police. Video footage obtained by a local TV station showed the gray car with its distinctive orange top being towed into a police garage.

Among the items confiscated from the men in Florida were $10,796 in cash and a GPS jammer. Law enforcement sources say jammers have become a core piece of technology for modern car thieves—necessary to disable the location tracking provided by GPS navigation systems in most cars. “Once they get the vehicles, they usually park them somewhere [and] put a signal jammer in there or cut out the GPS,” the Florida source told me. This buys them time to swap and reprogram the vehicle identification number (VIN), wipe car computers, and reprogram fobs to remove traces of the car’s provenance.

No two VINs are the same, and each is assigned to a specific vehicle by the manufacturer. Where they’re placed inside a vehicle varies by make and model. The NICB’s Woolf says cars also have confidential VINs located in places—including their electronic components—that are supposed to be known only to law enforcement and his organization. But criminals have figured out how to find and change them.

“It’s making it more and more difficult for us to identify vehicles as stolen,” Woolf says. “Every time we come up with a security measure to prevent the fraudster, they come up with a countermeasure.”

All this doesn’t even take very much time. “If you know what you’re doing, and you steal the car at one o’clock today, you can have it completely done at two o’clock today,” says Woolf. A vehicle can be rerouted, reprogrammed, re-VINed, and sometimes even retitled before an owner files a police report.

That appears to have been the plan in the case of the stolen light-gray 2023 Lamborghini Huracán owned by the Rockies’ Kris Bryant.

On September 29, 2024, a carrier hired via a load board arrived at Bryant’s home in Cherry Hills, Colorado, to pick up the car. It was supposed to be transported to Bryant’s Las Vegas residence within a few days. It never showed up there—but it was in fact in Vegas.

Using Flock traffic cameras, which capture license plate information in areas across the country, Detective Justin Smith of the Cherry Hills Village Police Department tracked the truck and trailer that had picked up the Lambo to Nevada, and he alerted local police.

On October 7, a Las Vegas officer spotted a car matching the Lamborghini’s description and pulled it over. The driver said the Huracán had been brought to his auto shop by a man whom the police were able to identify as Dat Viet Tieu. They arrested Tieu later that same day. In an interview with police, he identified himself as a car broker. He said he was going to resell the Lamborghini and that he had no idea that the car was stolen, according to the arrest report.

Police searched a Jeep Wrangler that Tieu had parked nearby and discovered it had been stolen—and had been re-VINed, retitled, and registered to his wife. Inside the car, police discovered “multiple fraudulent VIN stickers, key fobs to other high-end stolen vehicles, and fictitious placards,” their report said.

One of the fake VINs matched the make and model of Bryant’s Lamborghini. (Representatives for Bryant and the Rockies did not respond to a request for comment.)

Tieu was released on bail. But after he returned to LVPD headquarters two days later, on October 9, to reclaim his personal property, officers secretly placed him under surveillance with the hope that he’d lead them to one of the other stolen cars matching the key fobs they’d found in the Jeep.

It didn’t take long for them to get lucky. A few hours after leaving the police station, Tieu drove to Harry Reid International Airport, where he picked up an unidentified man. They drove to the Caesars Palace parking garage and pulled in near a GMC Sierra. Over the next three hours, the man worked on a laptop inside and outside the vehicle, according to a police report. At one point, he and Tieu connected jumper cables from Tieu’s rented Toyota Camry to the Sierra.

“At 2323 hours, the white male adult enters the GMC Sierra, and the vehicle’s ignition starts. It was readily apparent the [two men] had successfully re-programmed a key fob to the GMC Sierra,” the report said.

An officer watched as the man gave two key fobs to Tieu, who handed the man an unknown amount of cash. Still, the police let the men leave the garage.

The police kept Tieu and his wife under surveillance for more than a week. Then, on October 18, fearing the couple was about to leave town, officers entered Nora’s Italian Restaurant just off the Vegas Strip and took them into custody.

“Obviously, we meet again,” a detective told Tieu.

Police later searched the VIN on the Sierra from the Caesars lot and found that it had been reported stolen in Tremonton, Utah, roughly two weeks earlier. They eventually returned both the Sierra and Kris Bryant’s Lamborghini to their owners.

Tieu pleaded guilty to two felony counts of possession of a stolen vehicle and one count of defacing, altering, substituting, or removing a VIN. In October, he was sentenced to up to one year of probation; if it’s completed successfully, the plea agreement says, the counts of possession of a stolen vehicle will be dismissed. His attorneys, David Z. Chesnoff and Richard A. Schonfeld, said in a statement that they were “pleased” with the court’s decision, “in light of [Tieu’s] acceptance of responsibility.”

Many vehicles stolen via transport fraud are never recovered. Experts say the best way to stop this criminal cycle would be to disrupt it before it starts.

That would require significant changes to the way that load boards operate. Bryant’s Lamborghini, Zahr’s and Payne’s Rolls-Royces, and the orange Lamborghini Urus in Florida were all posted for transport on Central Dispatch. Both brokers and shippers argue that the company hasn’t taken enough responsibility for what they characterize as weak oversight.

“If the crap hits the fan, it’s on us as a broker, or it’s on the trucking company … they have no liability in the whole transaction process. So it definitely frosted a lot of people’s feathers.”

“You’re Cox Automotive—you’re the biggest car company in the world for dealers—and you’re not doing better screenings when you sign people up?” says Payne. (The spokesperson for Cox Automotive said that it has “a robust verification process for all clients … who sign up.”)

“If the crap hits the fan, it’s on us as a broker, or it’s on the trucking company, or the clients’ insurance, [which means] that they have no liability in the whole transaction process,” says Mills. “So it definitely frosted a lot of people’s feathers.”

Over the last year, Central Dispatch has made changes to further secure its platform. It introduced two-factor authentication for user accounts and started enabling shippers to use its app to track loads in real time, among other measures. It also kicked off an awareness campaign that includes online educational content and media appearances to communicate that the company takes its responsibilities seriously.

“We’ve removed over 500 accounts already in 2025, and we’ll continue to take any of that aggressive action where it’s needed,” said Lainey Sibble, Central Dispatch’s head of business, in a sponsored episode of the Auto Remarketing Podcast. “We also recognize this is not going to happen in a silo. Everyone has a role to play here, and it’s really going to take us all working together in partnership to combat this issue.”

Mills says Central Dispatch got faster at shutting down fraudulent accounts toward the end of last year. But it’s going to take time to fix the industry, he adds: “I compare it to a 15-year opioid addiction. It’s going to take a while to detox the system.”

Yariv, the broker in West Palm Beach, says he has stopped using Central Dispatch and other load boards altogether. “One person has access here, and that’s me. I don’t even log in,” he told me. His team has gone back to working the phones, as evidenced by the din of voices in the background as we spoke.

“[The fraud is] everywhere. It’s constant,” he said. “The only way it goes away is the dispatch boards have to be shut down—and that’ll never happen.”

It also remains to be seen what kind of accountability there will be for the alleged thieves in Florida. Korotovskyy and Nazarian pleaded not guilty; as of press time, their trials were scheduled to begin in May. (Korotovskyy’s lawyer, Bruce Prober, said in a statement that the case “is an ongoing matter” and his client is “presumed innocent,” while Nazarian’s attorney, Yale Sanford, said in a statement, “As the investigation continues, Mr. Nazarian firmly asserts his innocence.” A spokesperson with Florida’s Office of the State Attorney emailed a statement: “The circumstances related to these arrests are still a matter of investigation and prosecution. It would be inappropriate to be commenting further.”)

In contrast, Gevorgyan, the third man arrested in the Florida sting, pleaded guilty to four charges.

Yet he maintains his innocence, according to Cooper, his lawyer: “He was pleading [guilty] to get out and go home.” Cooper describes his client as a wealthy Armenian national who runs a jewelry business back home, adding that he was deported to Armenia in September.

Cooper says his client’s “sweetheart” plea deal doesn’t require him to testify or otherwise supply information against his alleged co-conspirators—or to reveal details about how all these luxury cars were mysteriously disappearing across South Florida. Cooper also says prosecutors may have a difficult time convicting the other two men, arguing that police acted prematurely by arresting the trio without first seeing what, if anything, they intended to do with the Lamborghini.

“All they ever had,” Cooper says, “was three schmucks sitting outside of the Lamborghini.”

Here are our picks for the advances to watch in the years ahead—and why we think they matter right now.

The Cybertruck, sycophantic AI, and humanoid robots all made this year’s list of the biggest technology failures.

Speaking with popular AI content creators convinces me that “slop” isn’t just the internet rotting in real time, but the early draft of a new kind of pop culture.

I asked my MIT class to consider why some of the advances that MIT Technology Review’s journalists thought would change our world never really did—and what we can learn from the flops.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">When work went remote, the sound of business changed. What began as a scramble to make home offices functional has evolved into a revolution in how people hear and are heard. From education to enterprises, companies across industries have reimagined what clear, reliable communication can mean in a hybrid world. For major audio and communications enterprises like Shure and Zoom, that transformation has been powered by artificial intelligence, new acoustic technologies, and a shared mission: making connection effortless.

Necessity during the pandemic accelerated years of innovation in months.

&quot;Audio and video just working is a baseline for collaboration,&quot; says chief ecosystem officer at Zoom, Brendan Ittelson. &quot;That expectation has shifted from connecting people to enhancing productivity and creativity across the entire ecosystem.&quot;

Audio is a foundation for trust, understanding, and collaboration. Poor sound quality can distort meaning and fatigue listeners, while crisp audio and intelligent processing can make digital interactions feel nearly as natural as in-person exchanges.

&quot;If you think about the fundamental need here,&quot; adds chief technology officer at Shure, Sam Sabet, &quot;It&#39;s the ability to amplify the audio and the information that&#39;s really needed, and diminish the unwanted sounds and audio so that we can enhance that experience and make it seamless for people to communicate.&quot;

For both Ittelson and Sabet, AI now sits at the center of this progress. For Shure, machine learning powers real-time noise suppression, adaptive beamforming, and spatial audio that tunes itself to a room’s acoustics. For Zoom, AI underpins every layer of its platform, from dynamic noise reduction to automated meeting summaries and intelligent assistants that anticipate user needs. These tools are transforming communication from reactive to proactive, enabling systems that understand intent, context, and emotion.

&quot;Even if you&#39;re not working from home and coming into the office, the types of spaces and environments you try to collaborate in today are constantly changing because our needs are constantly changing,&quot; says Sabet. &quot;Having software and algorithms that adapt seamlessly and self-optimize based on the acoustics of the room, based on the different layouts of the spaces where people collaborate in is instrumental.&quot;

The future, they suggest, is one where technology fades into the background. As audio devices and AI companions learn to self-optimize, users won’t think about microphones or meeting links. Instead, they’ll simply connect. Both companies are now exploring agentic AI systems and advanced wireless solutions that promise to make collaboration seamless across spaces, whether in classrooms, conference rooms, or virtual environments yet to come.

&quot;It&#39;s about helping people focus on strategy and creativity instead of administrative busy work,&quot; says Ittelson.

Now as the pandemic ushered in the cultural shift that led to our increasingly virtual world, it also sparked a flurry of innovation in the audio and video industries to keep employees and customers connected and businesses running. Today we&#39;re going to talk about the AI technologies behind those innovations, the impact on audio innovation, and the continuing emerging opportunities for further advances in audio capabilities.

My guests today are Sam Sabet, chief technology officer at Shure, and Brendan Ittelson, chief ecosystem officer at Zoom.

Sam Sabet: Thank you, Megan. It&#39;s a pleasure to be here and I&#39;m looking forward to this conversation with both you and Brendan. It should be a very exciting conversation.

Brendan Ittelson: Thank you so much for having me today. I&#39;m looking forward to the conversation and all the topics we have to dive into on this area.

Megan: Fantastic. Lovely to have you both here. And Sam, just to set some context, I wonder if we could start with the pandemic and the innovation that really was born out of necessity. I mean, when it became clear that we were all going to be virtual for the foreseeable future, I wonder what was the first technological mission for Shure?

Sam: Yeah, very good question. The pandemic really accelerated a lot of innovation around virtual communications and fundamentally how we perform our everyday jobs remotely. One of our first technological mission when the pandemic happened and everybody ended up going home and performing their functions remotely was to make sure that people could continue to communicate effectively, whether that&#39;s for business meetings, virtual events, or educational purposes. We focused on collaboration and enhancing collaboration tools. And ideally what we were aiming to do, or we focused on, was to basically improve the ease of use and configuration of audio tool sets.

Because unlike the office environment where it might be a lot more controlled, people are working from non-traditional areas like home offices or other makeshift solutions, we needed to make sure that people could still get pristine audio and that studio level audio even in uncontrolled environments that are not really made for that. We expedited development in our software solutions. We created tool sets that allowed for ease of deployment and remote configuration and management so we could enable people to continue doing the things they needed to do without having to worry about the underlying technology.

Megan: And Brendan, during that time, it seemed everyone became a Zoom user of some sort. I mean, what was the first mission at Zoom when virtual connection became this necessity for everyone?

Brendan: Well, our mission fundamentally didn&#39;t change. It&#39;s always been about delivering frictionless communications. What shifted was the urgency and the magnitude of what we were doing. Our focus shifted on how we do this reliably, securely, and to scale to ensure these millions of new users could connect instantly without friction. We really shifted our thinking of being just a business continuity tool to becoming a lifeline for so many individuals and industries. The stories that we heard across education, healthcare, and just general human connection, the number of those moments that matter to people that we were able to help facilitate just became so important. We really focused on how can we be there and make it frictionless so folks can focus on that human connection. And that accelerated our thinking in terms of innovation and reinforced the thought that we need to focus on the simplicity, accessibility, and trust in communication technology so that people could focus on that connection and not the technology that makes it possible.

Megan: That&#39;s so true. It did really just become an absolute lifeline for people, didn&#39;t it? And before we dive into the technologies beyond these emerging capabilities, I wonder if we could first talk about just the importance of clear audio. I mean, Sam, as much as we all worry over how we look on Zoom, is how we sound perhaps as or even more impactful?

Sam: Yeah, you&#39;re absolutely correct. I mean, clear audio is absolutely critical for effective communications. Video quality is very important absolutely, but poor audio can really hinder understanding and engagement. As a matter of fact, there&#39;s studies and research from areas such as Yale University that say that poor audio can make understanding somewhat more challenged and even affect retention of information. Especially in an educational type environment where there&#39;s a lot of background noise and very differing types of spaces like auditoriums and lecture halls, it really becomes a high priority that you have great audio quality. And during the pandemic, as you said, and as Brendan rightly said, it became one of our highest priorities to focus on technologies like beamforming mics and ways to focus on the speaker&#39;s voice and minimize that unwanted background noise so that we could ensure that the communication was efficient, was well understood, and that it removed the distraction so people could be able to actually communicate and retain the information that was being shared.

Megan: It is incredible just how impactful audio can be, can&#39;t it? Brendan, I mean as you said, remote and hybrid collaboration is part of Zoom&#39;s DNA. What observations can you share about how users have grown along with the technological advancements and maybe how their expectations have grown as well?

Brendan: Definitely. I mean, users now expect seamless and intelligent experiences. Audio and video just working is a baseline for collaboration. That expectation has shifted from connecting people to enhancing productivity and creativity across the entire ecosystem. When we look at it, we&#39;re really looking at these trends in terms of how people want to be better when they&#39;re at home. For example, AI-powered tools like Smart Summaries, translation and noise suppression to help people stay productive and connected no matter where they&#39;re working. But then this also comes into play at the office. We&#39;re starting to see folks that dive into our technology like Intelligent Director and Smart Name Tags that create that meeting equity even when they&#39;re in a conference room.

So, the remote experience and the room experience all are similar and create that same ability to be seen, heard, and contribute. And we&#39;re now diving further into this that it&#39;s beyond just meetings. Zoom is really transforming into an AI-first work platform that&#39;s focused on human connection. And so that goes beyond the meetings into things like Chat, Zoom Docs, Zoom Events and Webinars, the Zoom Contact Center and more. And all of this being brought together using our AI Companion at its core to help connect all of those different points of connection for individuals.

Megan: I mean, so Brendan, we know it wasn&#39;t only workplaces that were affected by the pandemic, it was also the education sector that had to undergo a huge change. I wondered if you could talk a little bit about how Zoom has operated in that higher education sphere as well.

Brendan: Definitely. Education has always been a focus for Zoom and an area that we&#39;ve believed in. Because education and learning is something as a company we value and so we have invested in that sector. And personally being the son of academics, it is always an area that I find fascinating. We continue to invest in terms of how do we make the classroom a stronger space? And especially now that the classroom has changed, where it can be in person, it can be virtual, it can be a mix. And using Zoom and its tools, we&#39;re able to help bridge all those different scenarios to make learning accessible to students no matter their means.

That&#39;s what truly excites us, is being able to have that technology that allows people to pursue their desires, their interests, and really up-level their pursuits and inspire more. We&#39;re constantly investing in how to allow those messages to get out and to integrate in the flow of communication and collaboration that higher education uses, whether that&#39;s being integrated into the classroom, into learning management systems, to make that a seamless flow so that students and their educators can just collaborate seamlessly. And also that we can support all the infrastructure and administration that helps make that possible.

Megan: Absolutely. Such an important thing. And Sam, Shure as well, could you talk to us a bit about how you worked in that kind of education space as well from an audio point of view?

Sam: Absolutely. Actually, this is a topic that&#39;s near and dear to my heart because I&#39;m actually an adjunct professor in my free time.

Sam: And the challenges of trying to do this sort of a hybrid lecture, if you will. And Shure has been particularly well suited for this environment and we&#39;ve been focused on it and investing in technologies there for decades. If you think about how a lecture hall is structured, it&#39;s a little different than just having a meeting around the conference table. And Shure has focused on creating products that allow this combination of a presenter scenario along with a meeting space plus the far end where users or students are remote, they can hear intelligibly what&#39;s happening in the lecture hall, but they can also participate.

Between our products like the Ceiling Mic Arrays and our wireless microphones that are purpose built for presenters and educators like our MXW neXt product line, we&#39;ve created technologies that allow those two previously separate worlds to integrate together. And then add that onto integrating with Zoom and other products that allow for that collaboration has been very instrumental. And again, being a user and providing those lectures, I can see a night and day difference and just how much more effective my lectures are today from where they were five to six years ago. And that&#39;s all just made possible by all the technologies that are purpose built for these scenarios and integrating more with these powerful tools that just make the job so much more seamless.

Megan: Absolutely fascinating that you got to put the technology to use yourself as well to check that it was all working well. And you mentioned AI there, of course. I mean, Sam, what AI technologies have had the most significant impact on recent audio advancements too?

Sam: Yeah. Absolutely. If you think about the fundamental need here, it&#39;s the ability to amplify the audio and the information that&#39;s really needed and diminish the unwanted sounds and audio so that we can enhance that experience and make it seamless for people to communicate. With our innovations at Shure, we&#39;ve leveraged the cutting-edge technologies to both enhance communication effectiveness and to align seamlessly with evolving features in unified communications like the ones that Brandon just mentioned in the Zoom platforms.

We partner with industry leaders like Zoom to ensure that we&#39;re providing the ability to be able to focus on that needed audio and eliminate all the background distractions. AI has transformed that audio technology with things like machine learning algorithms that enable us to do more real-time audio processing and significantly enhancing things like noise reduction and speech isolation. Just to give you a simple example, our IntelliMix Room audio processing software that we&#39;ve released as well as part of a complete room solution uses AI to optimize sound in different environments.

And really that&#39;s one of the fundamental changes in this period, whether that&#39;s pandemic or post-pandemic, is that the key is really flexibility and being able to adapt to changing work environments. Even if you&#39;re not working from home and coming into the office, the types of spaces and environments you try to collaborate in today are constantly changing because our needs are constantly changing. And so having software and algorithms that adapt seamlessly and are able to self-optimize based on the acoustics of the room, based on the different layouts of the spaces where people collaborate in is instrumental.

And then last but not least, AI has transformed the way audio and video integrate. For example, we utilize voice recognition systems that integrate with intelligent cameras so that we enable voice tracking technology so that cameras can not only identify who&#39;s speaking, but you have the ability to hear and see people clearly. And that in general just enhances the overall communication experience.

Megan: Wow. It&#39;s just so much innovation in quite a short space of time really. I mean, Brendan, you mentioned AI a little bit there beforehand, but I wonder what other AI technologies have had the biggest impact as Zoom builds out its own emerging capabilities?

Brendan: Definitely. And I couldn&#39;t agree more with Sam that, I mean, AI has made such a big shift and it&#39;s really across the spectrum. And when I think about it, there&#39;s almost three tiers when you look at the stack. You start off at the raw audio where AI is doing those things like noise suppression, echo cancellation, voice enhancements. All of that just makes this amazing audio signal that can then go into the next layer, which is the speech AI and natural language processing. Which starts to open up those items such as the real-time transcription, translation, searchable content to make the communication not just what&#39;s heard, but making it more accessible to more individuals and inclusive by providing that content in a format that is best for them.

And then you take those two layers and put the generative and agentic AI on top of that, that can start surfacing insights, summarize the conversation, and even take actions on someone&#39;s behalf. It really starts to change the way that people work and how they have access and allows them to connect. I think it is a huge shift and I&#39;m very excited by how those three levels start to interact to really enable people to do more and to connect thanks to AI.

Megan: Yeah. Absolutely. So much rich information that can come out from a single call now because of those sorts of tools. And following on from that, Brendan, I mean, you mentioned before the Zoom AI Companion. I wondered if you could talk a bit about what were your top priorities when building that product to ensure it was truly useful for your customers?

Brendan: Definitely. When we developed AI Companion, we had two priority focus areas from day one, trust and security, and then accuracy and relevance. On the trust side, it was a non-negotiable that customer data wouldn&#39;t be used to train our models. People need to know that their conversations and content are private and secure.

Brendan: And then with accuracy, we needed to ensure AI outputs weren&#39;t generic but grounded in the actual context of a meeting, a chat or a product. But the real story here when I think about AI Companion is the customer value that it delivers. AI Companion helps people save time with meeting recaps, task generation, and proactive prep for the next session. It reduces that friction in hybrid work, whether you&#39;re in a meeting room, a Zoom room, or collaborating across different collaboration tools like Microsoft or Google. And it enables more equitable participation by surfacing the right context for everyone no matter where and how they&#39;re working.

All this leads to a result where it&#39;s practical, trustworthy, and embedded where work happens. And it&#39;s just not another tool to manage, it&#39;s there in someone&#39;s flow of work to help them along the way.

Megan: Yeah. That trust piece is just so important, isn&#39;t it, today? And Sam, as much as AI has impacted audio innovation, audio has also had an impact on AI capabilities. I wondered if you could talk a little bit about audio as a data input and the advancements technologies like large language models, LLMs, are enabling.

Sam: Absolutely. Audio is really a rich data source that&#39;s added a new dimension to AI capabilities. If you think about speech recognition or natural language processing, they&#39;ve had significant advances due to audio data that&#39;s provided for them. And to Brendan&#39;s point about trust and accuracy, I like to think of the products that Shure enables customers with as essentially the eyes and ears in the room for leading AI companions just like the Zoom AI Companion. You really need that pristine audio input to be able to trust the accuracy of what the AI generates. These AI Companions have been very instrumental in the way we do business every day. I mean, between transcription, speaker attributions, the ability to add action items within a meeting and be able to track what&#39;s happening in our interactions, all of that really has to rely on that accurate and pristine input from audio into the AI. I feel that further improves the trust that our end users have to the results of AI and be able to leverage it more.

If you think about it, if you look at how AI audio inputs enhance that interactive AI system, it enables more natural and intuitive interactions with AI. And it really allows for that seamless integration and the ability for users to use it without having to worry about, is the room set up correctly? Is the audio level proper? And when we talk even about agentic AI, we&#39;re working on future developments where systems can self-heal or detect that there are issues in the environment so that they can autocorrect and adapt in all these different environments and further enable the AI to be able to do a much more effective job, if you will.

Megan: Sam, you touched on future developments there. I wonder if we could close our conversation today with a bit of a future forward look, if we could. Brendan, can you share innovations that Zoom is working on now and what are you most excited to see come to fruition?

Brendan: Well, your timing for this question is absolutely perfect because we&#39;ve just wrapped up Zoomtopia 2025.

Brendan: And this is where we discussed a lot of the new AI innovations that we have coming to Zoom. Starting off, there&#39;s AI Companion 3.0. And we&#39;ve launched this next generation of agentic AI capabilities in Zoom Workplace. And with 3.0 when it releases, it isn&#39;t just about transcribing, it&#39;s turned into really a platform that helps you with follow-up task, prep for your next conversation, and even proactively suggest how to free up your time. For example, AI Companion can help you schedule meetings intelligently across time zones, suggest which meetings you can skip, and still stay informed and even prepare you with context and insights before you walk into the conversation. It&#39;s about helping people focus on strategy and creativity instead of administrative busy work. And for hybrid work specifically, we introduced Zoomie Group Assistant, which will be a big leap for hybrid collaboration.

Acting as an assistant for a group chat and meetings, you can simply ask, “@Zoomie, what&#39;s the latest update on the project?” Or “@Zoomie, what are the team&#39;s action items?” And then get instant answers. Or because we&#39;re talking about audio here, you can go into a conference room and say, &quot;Hey, Zoomie,&quot; and get help with things like checking into a room, adjusting lights, temperature, or even sharing your screen. And while all these are built-in features, we&#39;re also expanding the platform to allow custom AI agents through our AI Studio, so organizations can bring their own agents or integrate with third-party ones.

Zoom has always believed in an open platform and philosophy and that is continuing. Folks using AI Companion 3.0 will be able to use agents across platforms to work with the workflows that they have across all the different SaaS vendors that they might have in their environment, whether that&#39;s Google, Microsoft, ServiceNow, Cisco, and so many other tools.

Megan: Fantastic. It certainly sounds like a tool I could use in my work, so I look forward to hearing more about that. And Sam, we&#39;ve touched on there are so many exciting things happening in audio too. What are you working on at Shure? And what are you most excited to see come to fruition?

Sam: At Shure, our engineering teams are really working on a range of exciting projects, but particularly we&#39;re working on developing new collaboration solutions that are integral for IT end users. And these integrate obviously with the leading UC platforms.

We&#39;re integrating audio and video technologies that are scalable, reliable solutions. And we want to be able to seamlessly connect these to cloud services so that we can leverage both AI technologies and the tool sets available to optimize every type of workspace essentially. Not just meeting rooms, but lecture halls, work from home scenarios, et cetera.

The other area that we really focus on in terms of our reliability and quality really comes from our DNA in the pro audio world. And that&#39;s really all-around wireless audio technologies. We&#39;re developing our next-generation wireless systems and these are going to offer even greater reliability and range. And they really become ideal for everything from a large-scale event to personal home use and the gamut across that whole spectrum. And I think all of that in partnership with our partners like Zoom will help just facilitate the modern workspace.

Megan: Absolutely. So much exciting innovation clearly going on behind the scenes. Thank you both so much.

Hackers made death threats against this security researcher. Big mistake.

In April 2024, a mysterious someone using the online handles “Waifu” and “Judische” began posting death threats on Telegram and Discord channels aimed at a cybersecurity researcher named Allison Nixon.These anonymous personas targeted Nixon because she had become a formidable threat: As chief research officer at the cyber investigations firm Unit 221B, named after Sherlock Holmes’s apartment, she had built a career tracking cybercriminals and helping get them arrested.Though she’d done this work for more than a decade, Nixon couldn’t understand why the person behind the accounts was suddenly threatening her. And although she had taken an interest in the Waifu persona in years past for crimes he boasted about committing, he hadn’t been on her radar for a while when the threats began, because she was tracking other targets.Now Nixon resolved to unmask Waifu/Judische and others responsible for the death threats—and take them down for crimes they admitted to committing.

ALS stole this musician’s voice. AI let him sing again.

There are tears in the audience as Patrick Darling’s song begins to play. It’s a heartfelt song written for his great-grandfather, whom he never got the chance to meet. But this performance is emotional for another reason: It’s Darling’s first time on stage with his bandmates since he lost the ability to sing two years ago.

The 32-year-old musician was diagnosed with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) when he was 29 years old. Like other types of motor neuron disease, it affects nerves that supply the body’s muscles. People with ALS eventually lose the ability to control their muscles, including those that allow them to move, speak, and breathe.

Darling’s last stage performance was over two years ago. By that point, he had already lost the ability to stand and play his instruments and was struggling to sing or speak. But recently, he was able to re-create his lost voice using an AI tool trained on snippets of old audio recordings. Another AI tool has enabled him to use this “voice clone” to compose new songs. Darling is able to make music again. Read the full story.

            <h2>The scientist using AI to hunt for antibiotics just about everywhere</h2>
            <p><strong>MIT Technology Review | 2026-02-16</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2026/02/16/1132516/cesar-de-la-fuente-using-ai-antibiotics-hunt/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">When he was just a teenager trying to decide what to do with his life, César de la Fuente compiled a list of the world’s biggest problems. He ranked them inversely by how much money governments were spending to solve them. Antimicrobial resistance topped the list.

Twenty years on, the problem has not gone away. If anything, it’s gotten worse. Infections caused by bacteria, fungi, and viruses that have evolved ways to evade treatments are now associated with more than 4 million deaths per year, and a recent analysis, published in the Lancet, predicts that number could surge past 8 million by 2050. In a July 2025 essay in Physical Review Letters, de la Fuente, now a bioengineer and computational biologist, and synthetic biologist James Collins warned of a looming “post­antibiotic” era in which infections from drug-resistant strains of common bacteria like Escherichia coli or Staphylococcus aureus, which can often still be treated by our current arsenal of medications, become fatal. “The antibiotic discovery pipeline remains perilously thin,” they wrote, “impeded by high development costs, lengthy timelines, and low returns on investment.”

But de la Fuente is using artificial intelligence to bring about a different future. His team at the University of Pennsylvania is training AI tools to search genomes far and deep for peptides with antibiotic properties. His vision is to assemble those peptides—molecules made of up to 50 amino acids linked together—into various configurations, including some never seen in nature. The results, he hopes, could defend the body against microbes that withstand traditional treatments.

His quest has unearthed promising candidates in unexpected places. In August 2025 his team, which includes 16 scientists in Penn’s Machine Biology Group, described peptides hiding in the genetic code of ancient single-celled organisms called archaea. Before that, they’d excavated a list of candidates from the venom of snakes, wasps, and spiders. And in an ongoing project de la Fuente calls “molecular de-­extinction,” he and his collaborators have been scanning published genetic sequences of extinct species for potentially functional molecules. Those species include hominids like Neanderthals and Denisovans and charismatic megafauna like woolly mammoths, as well as ancient zebras and penguins. In the history of life on Earth, de la Fuente reasons, maybe some organism evolved an antimicrobial defense that could be helpful today. Those long-gone codes have given rise to resurrected compounds with names like ­mammuthusin-2 (from woolly mammoth DNA), mylodonin-2 (from the giant sloth), and hydrodamin-1 (from the ancient sea cow). Over the last few years, this molecular binge has enabled de la Fuente to amass a library of more than a million genetic recipes.

At 40 years old, de la Fuente has also collected a trophy case of awards from the American Society for Microbiology, the American Chemical Society, and other organizations. (In 2019, this magazine named him one of “35 Innovators Under 35” for bringing computational approaches to antibiotic discovery.) He’s widely recognized as a leader in the effort to harness AI for real-world problems. “He’s really helped pioneer that space,” says Collins, who is at MIT. (The two have not collaborated in the laboratory, but Collins has long been at the forefront of using AI for drug discovery, including the search for antibiotics. In 2020, Collins’s team used an AI model to predict a broad-­spectrum antibiotic, halicin, that is now in preclinical development.)

The world of antibiotic development needs as much creativity and innovation as researchers can muster, says Collins. And de la Fuente’s work on peptides has pushed the field forward: “César is marvelously talented, very innovative.”

De la Fuente describes antimicrobial resistance as an “almost impossible” problem, but he sees plenty of room for exploration in the word almost. “I like challenges,” he says, “and I think this is the ultimate challenge.”

The use, overuse, and misuse of antibiotics, he says, drives antimicrobial resistance. And the problem is growing unchecked because conventional ways to find, make, and test the drugs are prohibitively expensive and often lead to dead ends. “A lot of the companies that have attempted to do antibiotic development in the past have ended up folding because there’s no good return on investment at the end of the day,” he says.

Antibiotic discovery has always been a messy, noisy endeavor, driven by serendipity and fraught with uncertainty and misdirection. For decades, researchers have largely relied on brute-force mechanical methods. “Scientists dig into soil, they dig into water,” says de la Fuente. “And then from that complex organic matter they try to extract antimicrobial molecules.”

But molecules can be extraordinarily complex. Researchers have estimated the number of possible organic combinations that could be synthesized at somewhere around 1060. For reference, Earth contains an estimated 1018 grains of sand. “Drug discovery in any domain is a statistics game,” says Jonathan Stokes, a chemical biologist at McMaster University in Canada, who has been using generative AI to design potential new antibiotics that can be synthesized in a lab, and who worked with Collins on halicin. “You need enough shots on goal to happen to get one.”

Those have to be good shots, though. And AI seems well suited to improving researchers’ aim. Biology is an information source, de la Fuente explains: “It’s like a bunch of code.” The code of DNA has four letters; proteins and peptides have 20, where each “letter” represents an amino acid. De la Fuente says his work amounts to training AI models to recognize sequences of letters that encode antimicrobial peptides, or AMPs. “If you think about it that way,” he says, “you can devise algorithms to mine the code and identify functional molecules, which can be antimicrobials. Or antimalarials. Or anticancer agents.”

Practically speaking, we’re still not there: These peptides haven’t yet been transformed into usable drugs that help people, and there are plenty of details—dosage, delivery, specific targets—that need to be sorted out, says de la Fuente. But AMPs are appealing because the body already uses them.They’re a critical part of the immune system and often the first line of defense against pathogenic infections. Unlike conventional antibiotics, which typically have one trick for killing bacteria, AMPs often exhibit a multimodal approach. They may disrupt the cell wall and the genetic material inside as well as a variety of cellular processes. A bacterial pathogen may evolve resistance to a conventional drug’s single mode of action, but maybe not to a multipronged AMP attack.

De la Fuente’s group is one of many pushing the boundaries of using AI for antibiotics. Where he focuses primarily on peptides, Collins works on small-molecule discovery. So does Stokes, at McMaster, whose models identify promising new molecules and predict whether they can be synthesized. “It’s only been a few years since folks have been using AI meaningfully in drug discovery,” says Collins.

Even in that short time the tools have changed, says James Zou, a computer scientist at Stanford University, who has worked with Stokes and Collins. Researchers have moved from using predictive models to developing generative approaches. With a predictive approach, Zou says, researchers screen large libraries of candidates that are known to be promising. Generative approaches offer something else: the appeal of designing a new molecule from scratch. Last year, for example, de la Fuente’s team used one generative AI model to design a suite of synthetic peptides and another to assess them. The group tested two of the resulting compounds on mice infected with a drug-resistant strain of Acinetobacter baumannii, a germ that the World Health Organization has identified as a “critical priority” in research on antimicrobial resistance. Both successfully and safely treated the infection.

But the field is still in the discovery phase. In his current work, de la Fuente is trying to get candidates closer to clinical testing. To that end, his team is developing an ambitious multimodal model called ApexOracle that’s designed to analyze a new pathogen, pinpoint its genetic weaknesses, match it to antimicrobial peptides that might work against it, and then predict how an antibiotic, built from those peptides, would fare in lab tests. It “converges understanding in chemistry, genomics, and language,” he says. It’s preliminary, he adds, but even if it doesn’t work perfectly, it will help steer the next generation of AI models toward the ultimate goal of resisting resistance.

Using AI, he believes, human researchers now have a fighting chance at catching up to the giant threat before them. The technology has already saved decades of human research time. Now he wants it to save lives, too: “This is the world that we live in today, and it’s incredible.”

            <h2>Hackers made death threats against this security researcher. Big mistake.</h2>
            <p><strong>MIT Technology Review | 2026-02-16</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2026/02/16/1132526/allison-nixon-hackers-security-researcher/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">In April 2024, a mysterious someone using the online handles “Waifu” and “Judische” began posting death threats on Telegram and Discord channels aimed at a cybersecurity researcher named Allison Nixon.

“Alison [sic] Nixon is gonna get necklaced with a tire filled with gasoline soon,” wrote Waifu/Judische, both of which are words with offensive connotations. “Decerebration is my fav type of brain death, thats whats gonna happen to alison Nixon.”

It wasn’t long before others piled on. Someone shared AI-generated nudes of Nixon.

These anonymous personas targeted Nixon because she had become a formidable threat: As chief research officer at the cyber investigations firm Unit 221B, named after Sherlock Holmes’s apartment, she had built a career tracking cybercriminals and helping get them arrested. For years she had lurked quietly in online chat channels or used pseudonyms to engage with perpetrators directly while piecing together clues they’d carelessly drop about themselves and their crimes. This had helped her bring to justice a number of cybercriminals—especially members of a loosely affiliated subculture of anarchic hackers who call themselves the Com.

But members of the Com aren’t just involved in hacking; some of them also engage in offline violence against researchers who track them. This includes bricking (throwing a brick through a victim’s window) and swatting (a dangerous type of hoax that involves reporting a false murder or hostage situation at someone’s home so SWAT teams will swarm it with guns drawn). Members of a Com offshoot known as 764 have been accused of even more violent acts—including animal torture, stabbings, and school shootings—or of inciting others in and outside the Com to commit these crimes.

Nixon started tracking members of the community more than a decade ago, when other researchers and people in law enforcement were largely ignoring them because they were young—many in their teens. Her early attention allowed her to develop strategies for unmasking them.

Ryan Brogan, a special agent with the FBI, says Nixon has helped him and colleagues identify and arrest more than two dozen members of the community since 2011, when he first began working with her, and that her skills in exposing them are unparalleled. “If you get on Allison’s and my radar, you’re going [down]. It’s just a matter of time,” he says. “No matter how much digital anonymity and tradecraft you try to apply, you’re done.”

Though she’d done this work for more than a decade, Nixon couldn’t understand why the person behind the Waifu/Judische accounts was suddenly threatening her. She had given media interviews about the Com—most recently on 60 Minutes—but not about her work unmasking members to get them arrested, so the hostility seemed to come out of the blue. And although she had taken an interest in the Waifu persona in years past for crimes he boasted about committing, he hadn’t been on her radar for a while when the threats began, because she was tracking other targets.

Now Nixon resolved to unmask Waifu/Judische and others responsible for the death threats—and take them down for crimes they admitted to committing. “Prior to them death-threatening me, I had no reason to pay attention to them,” she says.

Most people have never heard of the Com, but its influence and threat are growing.

It’s an online community comprising loosely affiliated groups of, primarily, teens and twentysomethings in North America and English-speaking parts of Europe who have become part of what some call a cybercrime youth movement.

International laws and norms, and fears of retaliation, prevent states from going all out in cyber operations. That doesn’t stop the anarchic Com.

Over the last decade, its criminal activities have escalated from simple distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks that disrupt websites to SIM-swapping hacks that hijack a victim’s phone service, as well as crypto theft, ransomware attacks, and corporate data theft. These crimes have affected AT&T, Microsoft, Uber, and others. Com members have also been involved in various forms of sextortion aimed at forcing victims to physically harm themselves or record themselves doing sexually explicit activities. The Com’s impact has also spread beyond the digital realm to kidnapping, beatings, and other violence.

One longtime cybercrime researcher, who asked to remain anonymous because of his work, says the Com is as big a threat in the cyber realm as Russia and China—for one unusual reason.

“There’s only so far that China is willing to go; there’s only so far that Russia or North Korea is willing to go,” he says, referring to international laws and norms, and fears of retaliation, that prevent states from going all out in cyber operations. That doesn’t stop the anarchic Com, he says.

“It is a pretty significant threat, and people tend to … push it under the rug [because] it’s just a bunch of kids,” he says. “But look at the impact [they have].”

Brogan says the amount of damage they do in terms of monetary losses “can become staggering very quickly.”

There is no single site where Com members congregate; they spread across a number of web forums and Telegram and Discord channels. The group follows a long line of hacking and subculture communities that emerged online over the last two decades, gained notoriety, and then faded or vanished after prominent members were arrested or other factors caused their decline. They differed in motivation and activity, but all emerged from “the same primordial soup,” says Nixon. The Com’s roots can be traced to the Scene, which began as a community of various “warez” groups engaged in pirating computer games, music, and movies.

When Nixon began looking at the Scene, in 2011, its members were hijacking gaming accounts, launching DDoS attacks, and running booter services. (DDoS attacks overwhelm a server or computer with traffic from bot-controlled machines, preventing legitimate traffic from getting through; booters are tools that anyone can rent to launch a DDoS attack against a target of choice.) While they made some money, their primary goal was notoriety.

This changed around 2018. Cryptocurrency values were rising, and the Com—or the Community, as it sometimes called itself—emerged as a subgroup that ultimately took over the Scene. Members began to focus on financial gain—cryptocurrency theft, data theft, and extortion.

The pandemic two years later saw a surge in Com membership that Nixon attributes to social isolation and the forced movement of kids online for schooling. But she believes economic conditions and socialization problems have also driven its growth. Many Com members can’t get jobs because they lack skills or have behavioral issues, she says. A number who have been arrested have had troubled home lives and difficulty adapting to school, and some have shown signs of mental illness. The Com provides camaraderie, support, and an outlet for personal frustrations. Since 2018, it has also offered some a solution to their money problems.

Loose-knit cells have sprouted from the community—Star Fraud, ShinyHunters, Scattered Spider, Lapsus$—to collaborate on clusters of crime. They usually target high-profile crypto bros and tech giants and have made millions of dollars from theft and extortion, according to court records.

But dominance, power, and bragging rights are still motivators, even in profit operations, says the cybercrime researcher, which is partly why members target “big whales.”

“There is financial gain,” he says, “but it’s also [sending a message that] I can reach out and touch the people that think they’re untouchable.” In fact, Nixon says, some members of the Com have overwhelming ego-driven motivations that end up conflicting with their financial motives.

“Often their financial schemes fall apart because of their ego, and that phenomenon is also what I’ve made my career on,” she says.

Nixon has straight dark hair, wears wire-rimmed glasses, and has a slight build and bookish demeanor that, on first impression, could allow her to pass for a teen herself. She talks about her work in rapid cadences, like someone whose brain is filled with facts that are under pressure to get out, and she exudes a sense of urgency as she tries to make people understand the threat the Com poses. She doesn’t suppress her happiness when someone she’s been tracking gets arrested.

In 2011, when she first began investigating the communities from which the Com emerged, she was working the night shift in the security operations center of the security firm SecureWorks. The center responded to tickets and security alerts emanating from customer networks, but Nixon coveted a position on the company’s counter-threats team, which investigated and published threat-intelligence reports on mostly state-sponsored hacking groups from China and Russia. Without connections or experience, she had no path to investigative work. But Nixon is an intensely curious person, and this created its own path.

Where the threat team focused on the impact hackers had on customer networks—how they broke in, what they stole—Nixon was more interested in their motivations and the personality traits that drove their actions. She assumed there must be online forums where criminal hackers congregated, so she googled “hacking forums” and landed on a site called Hack Forums.

She was surprised to see members openly discussing their crimes there. She reached out to someone on the SecureWorks threat team to see if he was aware of the site, and he dismissed it as a place for “script kiddies”—a pejorative term for unskilled hackers.

This was a time when many cybersecurity pros were shifting their focus away from cybercrime to state-sponsored hacking operations, which were more sophisticated and getting a lot of attention. But Nixon likes to zig where others zag, and her colleague’s dismissiveness fueled her interest in the forums. Two other SecureWorks colleagues shared that interest, and the three studied the forums during downtime on their shifts. They focused on trying to identify the people running DDoS booters.

What Nixon loved about the forums was how accessible they were to a beginner like herself. Threat-intelligence teams require privileged access to a victim’s network to investigate breaches. But Nixon could access everything she needed in the public forums, where the hackers seemed to think no one was watching. Because of this, they often made mistakes in operational security, or OPSEC—letting slip little biographical facts such as the city where they lived, a school they attended, or a place they used to work. These details revealed in their chats, combined with other information, could help expose the real identities behind their anonymous masks.

“It was a shock to me that it was relatively easy to figure out who [they were],” she says.

She wasn’t bothered by the immature boasting and petty fights that dominated the forums. “A lot of people don’t like to do this work of reading chat logs. I realize that this is a very uncommon thing. And maybe my brain is built a little weird that I’m willing to do this,” she says. “I have a special talent that I can wade through garbage and it doesn’t bother me.”

Nixon soon realized that not all the members were script kiddies. Some exhibited real ingenuity and “powerful” skills, she says, but because they were applying these to frivolous purposes—hijacking gamer accounts instead of draining bank accounts—researchers and law enforcement were ignoring them. Nixon began tracking them, suspecting that they would eventually direct their skills at more significant targets—an intuition that proved to be correct. And when they did, she had already amassed a wealth of information about them.

She continued her DDoS research for two years until a turning point in 2013, when the cybersecurity journalist Brian Krebs, who made a career tracking cybercriminals, got swatted.

About a dozen people from the security community worked with Krebs to expose the perpetrator, and Nixon was invited to help. Krebs sent her pieces of the puzzle to investigate, and eventually the group identified the culprit (though it would take two years for him to be arrested). When she was invited to dinner with Krebs and the other investigators, she realized she’d found her people.

“It was an amazing moment for me,” she says. “I was like, wow, there’s all these like-minded people that just want to help and are doing it just for the love of the game, basically.”

It was porn stars who provided Nixon with her next big research focus—one that underscored her skill at spotting Com actors and criminal trends in their nascent stages, before they emerged as major threats.

In 2018, someone was hijacking the social media accounts of certain adult-film stars and using those accounts to blast out crypto scams to their large follower bases. Nixon couldn’t figure out how the hackers had hijacked the social media profiles, but she promised to help the actors regain access to their accounts if they agreed to show her the private messages the hackers had sent or received during the time they controlled them. These messages led her to a forum where members were talking about how they stole the accounts. The hackers had tricked some of these actors into disclosing the mobile phone numbers of others. Then they used a technique called SIM swapping to reset passwords for social media accounts belonging to those other stars, locking them out.

In SIM swapping, fraudsters get a victim’s phone number assigned to a SIM card and phone they control, so that calls and messages intended for the victim go to them instead. This includes one-time security codes that sites text to account holders to verify themselves when accessing their account or changing its password. In some of the cases involving the porn stars, the hackers had manipulated telecom workers into making the SIM swaps for what they thought were legitimate reasons, and in other cases they bribed the workers to make the change. The hackers were then able to alter the password on the actors’ social media accounts, lock out the owners, and use the accounts to advertise their crypto scams.

SIM swapping is a powerful technique that can be used to hijack and drain entire cryptocurrency and bank accounts, so Nixon was surprised to see the fraudsters using it for relatively unprofitable schemes. But SIM swapping had rarely been used for financial fraud at that point, and like the earlier hackers Nixon had seen on Hack Forums, the ones hijacking porn star accounts didn’t seem to grasp the power of the technique they were using. Nixon suspected that this would change and SIM swapping would soon become a major problem, so she shifted her research focus accordingly. It didn’t take long for the fraudsters to pivot as well.

Nixon’s skill at looking ahead in this way has served her throughout her career. On multiple occasions a hacker or hacking group would catch her attention—for using a novel hacking approach in some minor operation, for example—and she’d begin tracking their online posts and chats in the belief that they’d eventually do something significant with that skill.

They usually did. When they later grabbed headlines with a showy or impactful operation, these hackers would seem to others to have emerged from nowhere, sending researchers and law enforcement scrambling to understand who they were. But Nixon would already have a dossier compiled on them and, in some cases, had unmasked their real identity as well. Lizard Squad was an example of this. The group burst into the headlines in 2014 and 2015 with a series of high-profile DDoS campaigns, but Nixon and colleagues at the job where she worked at the time had already been watching its members as individuals for a while. So the FBI sought their assistance in identifying them.

“The thing about these young hackers is that they … keep going until they get arrested, but it takes years for them to get arrested,” she says. “So a huge aspect of my career is just sitting on this information that has not been actioned [yet].”

It was during the Lizard Squad years that Nixon began developing tools to scrape and record hacker communications online, though it would be years before she began using these concepts to scrape the Com chatrooms and forums. These channels held a wealth of data that might not seem useful during the nascent stage of a hacker’s career but could prove critical later, when law enforcement got around to investigating them; yet the contents were always at risk of being deleted by Com members or getting taken down by law enforcement when it seized websites and chat channels.

Nixon’s work is unique because she engages with the actors in chat spaces to draw out information from them that “would not be otherwise normally available.”

Over several years, she scraped and preserved whatever chatrooms she was investigating. But it wasn’t until early 2020, when she joined Unit 221B, that she got the chance to scrape the Telegram and Discord channels of the Com. She pulled all of this data together into a searchable platform that other researchers and law enforcement could use. The company hired two former hackers to help build scraping tools and infrastructure for this work; the result is eWitness, a community-driven, invitation-­only platform. It was initially seeded only with data Nixon had collected after she arrived at Unit 221B, but has since been augmented with data that other users of the platform have scraped from Com social spaces as well, some of which doesn’t exist in public forums anymore.

Brogan, of the FBI, says it’s an incredibly valuable tool, made more so by Nixon’s own contributions. Other security firms scrape online criminal spaces as well, but they seldom share the content with outsiders, and Brogan says Nixon’s work is unique because she engages with the actors in chat spaces to draw out information from them that “would not be otherwise normally available.”

The preservation project she started when she got to Unit 221B could not have been better timed, because it coincided with the pandemic, the surge in new Com membership, and the emergence of two disturbing Com offshoots, CVLT and 764. She was able to capture their chats as these groups first emerged; after law enforcement arrested leaders of the groups and took control of the servers where their chats were posted, this material went offline.

CVLT—pronounced “cult”—was reportedly founded around 2019 with a focus on sextortion and child sexual abuse material. 764 emerged from CVLT and was spearheaded by a 15-year-old in Texas named Bradley Cadenhead, who named it after the first digits of his zip code. Its focus was extremism and violence.

In 2021, because of what she observed in these groups, Nixon turned her attention to sextortion among Com members.

The type of sextortion they engaged in has its roots in activity that began a decade ago as “fan signing.” Hackers would use the threat of doxxing to coerce someone, usually a young female, into writing the hacker’s handle on a piece of paper. The hacker would use a photo of it as an avatar on his online accounts—a kind of trophy. Eventually some began blackmailing victims into writing the hacker’s handle on their face, breasts, or genitals. With CVLT, this escalated even further; targets were blackmailed into carving a Com member’s name into their skin or engaging in sexually explicit acts while recording or livestreaming themselves.

During the pandemic a surprising number of SIM swappers crossed into child sexual abuse material and sadistic sextortion, according to Nixon. She hates tracking this gruesome activity, but she saw an opportunity to exploit it for good. She had long been frustrated at how leniently judges treated financial fraudsters because of their crimes’ seemingly nonviolent nature. But she saw a chance to get harsher sentences for them if she could tie them to their sextortion and began to focus on these crimes.

At this point, Waifu still wasn’t on her radar. But that was about to change.

Nixon landed in Waifu’s crosshairs after he and fellow members of the Com were involved in a large hack involving AT&T customer call records in April 2024.

Waifu’s group gained access to dozens of cloud accounts with Snowflake, a company that provides online data storage for customers. One of those customers had more than 50 billion call logs of AT&T wireless subscribers stored in its Snowflake account.

They tried to re-extort the telecom, threatening on social media to leak the records. They tagged the FBI in the post. “It’s like they were begging to be investigated,” says Nixon.

Among the subscriber records were call logs for FBI agents who were AT&T customers. Nixon and other researchers believe the hackers may have been able to identify the phone numbers of agents through other means. Then they may have used a reverse-lookup program to identify the owners of phone numbers that the agents called or that called them and found Nixon’s number among them. This is when they began harassing her.

But then they got reckless. They allegedly extorted nearly $400,000 from AT&T in exchange for promising to delete the call records they’d stolen. Then they tried to re-extort the telecom, threatening on social media to leak the records they claimed to have deleted if it didn’t pay more. They tagged the FBI in the post.

“It’s like they were begging to be investigated,” says Nixon.

The Snowflake breaches and AT&T records theft were grabbing headlines at the time, but Nixon had no idea her number was in the stolen logs or that Waifu/Judische was a prime suspect in the breaches. So she was perplexed when he started taunting and threatening her online.

Over several weeks in May and June, a pattern developed. Waifu or one of his associates would post a threat against her and then post a message online inviting her to talk. She assumes now that they believed she was helping law enforcement investigate the Snowflake breaches and hoped to draw her into a dialogue to extract information from her about what authorities knew. But Nixon wasn’t helping the FBI investigate them yet. It was only after she began looking at Waifu for the threats that she became aware of his suspected role in the Snowflake hack.

It wasn’t the first time she had studied him, though. Waifu had come to her attention in 2019 when he bragged about framing another Com member for a hoax bomb threat and later talked about his involvement in SIM-swapping operations. He made an impression on her. He clearly had technical skills, but Nixon says he also often appeared immature, impulsive, and emotionally unstable, and he was desperate for attention in his interactions with other members. He bragged about not needing sleep and using Adderall to hack through the night. He was also a bit reckless about protecting personal details. He wrote in private chats to another researcher that he would never get caught because he was good at OPSEC, but he also told the researcher that he lived in Canada—which turned out to be true.

Nixon’s process for unmasking Waifu followed a general recipe she used to unmask Com members: She’d draw a large investigative circle around a target and all the personas that communicated with that person online, and then study their interactions to narrow the circle to the people with the most significant connections to the target. Some of the best leads came from a target’s enemies; she could glean a lot of information about their identity, personality, and activities from what the people they fought with online said about them.

“The enemies and the ex-girlfriends, generally speaking, are the best [for gathering intelligence on a suspect],” she says. “I love them.”

While she was doing this, Waifu and his group were reaching out to other security researchers, trying to glean information about Nixon and what she might be investigating. They also attempted to plant false clues with the researchers by dropping the names of other cybercriminals in Canada who could plausibly be Waifu. Nixon had never seen cybercriminals engage in counterintelligence tactics like this.

Amid this subterfuge and confusion, Nixon and another researcher working with her did a lot of consulting and cross-checking with other researchers about the clues they were gathering to ensure they had the right name before they gave it to the FBI.

By July she and the researcher were convinced they had their guy: Connor Riley Moucka, a 25-year-old high school dropout living with his grandfather in Ontario. On October 30, Royal Canadian Mounted Police converged on Moucka’s home and arrested him.

According to an affidavit filed in Canadian court, a plainclothes Canadian police officer visited Moucka’s house under some pretense on the afternoon of October 21, nine days before the arrest, to secretly capture a photo of him and compare it with an image US authorities had provided. The officer knocked and rang the bell; Moucka opened the door looking disheveled and told the visitor: “You woke me up, sir.” He told the officer his name was Alex; Moucka sometimes used the alias Alexander Antonin Moucka. Satisfied that the person who answered the door was the person the US was seeking, the officer left. Waifu’s online rants against Nixon escalated at this point, as did his attempts at misdirection. She believes the visit to his door spooked him.

Nixon won’t say exactly how they unmasked Moucka—only that he made a mistake.

“I don’t want to train these people in how to not get caught [by revealing his error],” she says.

The Canadian affidavit against Moucka reveals a number of other violent posts he’s alleged to have made online beyond the threats he made against her. Some involve musings about becoming a serial killer or mass-mailing sodium nitrate pills to Black people in Michigan and Ohio; in another, his online persona talks about obtaining firearms to “kill Canadians” and commit “suicide by cop.”

Prosecutors, who list Moucka’s online aliases as including Waifu, Judische, and two more in the indictment, say he and others extorted at least $2.5 million from at least three victims whose data they stole from Snowflake accounts. Moucka has been charged with nearly two dozen counts, including conspiracy, unauthorized access to computers, extortion, and wire fraud. He has pleaded not guilty and was extradited to the US last July. His trial is scheduled for October this year, though hacking cases usually end in plea agreements rather than going to trial.

It took months for authorities to arrest Moucka after Nixon and her colleague shared their findings with the authorities, but an alleged associate of his in the Snowflake conspiracy, a US Army soldier named Cameron John Wagenius (Kiberphant0m online), was arrested more quickly.

On November 10, 2024, Nixon and her team found a mistake Wagenius made that helped identify him, and on December 20 he was arrested. Wagenius has already pleaded guilty to two charges around the sale or attempted sale of confidential phone records and will be sentenced this March.

These days Nixon continues to investigate sextortion among Com members. But she says that remaining members of Waifu’s group still taunt and threaten her.

“They are continuing to persist in their nonsense, and they are getting taken out one by one,” she says. “And I’m just going to keep doing that until there’s no one left on that side.”

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">When European tech observers talk about AI ambition, the narrative often splits neatly in two: models and infrastructure. On one side are the clever bits of code that can write, reason, and generate text or images.

On the other is the gritty reality of making those bits run reliably, at scale, and in production. Today, Mistral AI made a move that bridges that divide.

The Paris-based AI upstart confirmed its first acquisition by agreeing to buy Koyeb, another French venture focused on serverless cloud infrastructure for AI workloads. The deal, terms were not disclosed, marks a clear signal: Mistral wants to own not just cutting-edge AI models, but also the infrastructure that delivers them to developers and enterprises.

Mistral has built momentum over the past two years with large language models that have put it in close competition with U.S. players. But for all the excitement around models, real-world adoption hinges on how those models are deployed and scaled.

Koyeb’s technology is built for exactly that: a serverless platform that lets developers run AI apps without managing the underlying infrastructure.

Think of it as giving Mistral not only the engine but also the transmission, the parts that take raw computational power and make it usable on demand. That’s a critical piece when companies want to ship AI solutions without hiring a team of DevOps experts.

This acquisition dovetails with a wider strategy playing out in Europe: build an AI stack that doesn’t depend on U.S. hyperscalers.

Mistral recently announced a €1.2 billion investment in data centers in Sweden and has been vocal about offering a homegrown alternative to cloud services from AWS, Microsoft, and Google.

By folding Koyeb’s team and platform into what they call Mistral Compute, the company is laying claim to a more complex AI offering – from model training to deployment and inference. In other words, it’s less about selling APIs and more about owning the full AI experience.

Koyeb’s roots are in serverless computing, scalable, managed infrastructure that lets developers forget about servers and focus on code. Its platform supports AI tasks across CPUs, GPUs, and specialized accelerators, with features like autoscaling and isolated environments for complex applications.

The founders and all 13 team members are joining Mistral’s engineering ranks, where they’ll shift focus toward embedding their technology into the Mistral Compute platform. For existing users of Koyeb’s services, the transition is designed to be smooth, with the platform continuing to operate as usual while integrating deeper over time.

In a market still heavily dominated by U.S. cloud providers, owning more of the AI value chain is both a business move and a geopolitical statement. This deal isn’t just about snapping up a smaller startup; it’s about signalling a shift in how European AI companies conceive of competition and capability.

One of the early questions about the future of AI wasn’t whether Europe could produce models that compete with those from Silicon Valley, it was whether it could build the platforms and systems those models truly depend on. With the Koyeb acquisition, Mistral is making a direct answer to that question.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Venture capital has long avoided ‘hard’ sectors such as government, defence, energy, manufacturing, and hardware, viewing them as uninvestable because startups have limited scope to challenge incumbents. Instead, investors have prioritised fast-moving and lightly regulated software markets with lower barriers to entry.

End users in these hard industries have paid the price, as a lack of innovation funding has left them stuck with incumbent providers that continue to deliver clunky, unintuitive solutions that are difficult to migrate from.

However, that perception is now shifting. Investors are responding to new market dynamics within complex industries and the evolving methods startups are using to outperform incumbents.

Government technology spending more than doubled between 2021 and 2025, while defence technology more than doubled in 2025 alone, and we see similar trends in robotics, industrial technology, and healthcare.  This signals a clear change in investor mindset as AI-first approaches are changing adoption cycles.

Historically, those sectors had been viewed as incompatible with venture capital norms: slow procurement cycles, strict regulation, heavy operational and capital requirements, as well as deep integration into physical systems.

For example, on a global level, public procurement can take years, constrained by budgeting cycles, legislation and accountability frameworks. Energy projects must comply with regulatory regimes and national permitting structures, and infrastructure and hardware deployments require extensive certification and long engineering cycles.

Government and public-sector buyers also tend to prioritise reliability, compliance, track record, and legacy relationships over speed, meaning major contracts often go to incumbents rather than startups. Similar dynamics exist in construction, mining, logistics, and manufacturing, all sectors that are still dominated by legacy vendors, complex supply chains, and thin operational margins.

That view is now changing. Capital is increasingly flowing into sectors once seen as too bureaucratic or operationally complex. Beyond those headline sectors, construction tech, industrial automation, logistics software, healthcare, and public-sector tooling are attracting record levels of early-stage and growth capital.

The key question is: what is driving this shift in investor thinking?

The shift in investor priorities is partly driven by macro and geopolitical pressures. Supply-chain disruption, energyinsecurity and infrastructure fragility have elevated industrial resilience to a national priority. Governments are investing heavily in grid modernisation, logistics networks, and critical infrastructure, while public institutions face mounting pressure to digitise procurement, compliance, and workflow systems.

What were once considered slow, bureaucratic markets are now seen as structurally supported by policy and long-term demand.

AI is the driving force and is reshaping traditionally hard industries. By lowering the cost of building sophisticated software and enabling immediate performance gains with shorter adoption cycles, AI allows startups to compete with incumbents in sectors such as construction, mining, manufacturing, logistics, and public services from day one.

As software becomes easier to replicate, defensibility is shifting toward operational depth, substantial UI/UX improvements, speed to market, and more seamless integration into complex real-world systems.

Finally, saturation in horizontal SaaS has pushed investors to look elsewhere for differentiated returns. Crowded softwarecategories offer diminishing breakout potential and are often threatened by OpenAI and Anthropic’s fast pace of innovation, whereas regulated and infrastructure-heavy sectors provide less competition, stronger pricing power, higher switching costs, and gigantic TAMs.

SAP with a $200B cap is just an example, but the same goes for Caterpillar, Siemens, Big Utilities, Big Pharma, and many others.

Regulation, once viewed as a deterrent, is increasingly understood as a moat. Startups that successfully navigate procurement frameworks, compliance regimes, and industry standards build advantages that are difficult for new entrants to replicate and cannot be vibe-coded.

Legacy players, while trying to adopt new AI tooling as quickly as they can, still struggle to adapt their workflows and scale innovation as quickly as younger companies can. Their dominance has relied on the high cost of switching away from their solutions, but as attention and investment shift toward hard sectors, incumbents can no longer rely solely on their brand reputation.

Even industry leaders like Salesforce are relying more on acquisitions to keep up, showing how new technology and easier alternatives are lowering switching costs and making it harder for established companies to hold onto customers.

Startups are also increasingly being built by innovative industry specialists, who aren’t confined by the same limitations as legacy players. Many startup founders in defence, energy, healthcare, and government procurement come directly from these industries or have unique insights into their inner weaknesses.

The next wave of disruption will hit legacy companies hard, as startups prove they can innovate with the speed, flexibilityand focus that incumbents often lack. In sectors long protected by regulation or procurement friction, younger companiesare demonstrating that modern software, AI, and new business models can unlock performance improvements that established players struggle to match. Investor playbooks are already evolving, and that shift will likely accelerate in the year ahead.

At the same time, the total addressable market ceiling has been lifted. By moving beyond narrow software categories and into the physical economy, startups are targeting markets measured not in billions, but in trillions. As a result, we should expect more $100 billion companies to be built in this cycle. It’s no longer just about building better software.

It’s about rebuilding foundational sectors of the global economy.

            <h2>The European Parliament pulls back AI from its own devices</h2>
            <p><strong>The Next Web | 2026-02-17</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://thenextweb.com/news/the-european-parliament-pulls-back-ai-from-its-own-devices">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The European Parliament has taken a rare and telling step: it has disabled built-in artificial intelligence features on work devices used by lawmakers and staff, citing unresolved concerns about data security, privacy, and the opaque nature of cloud-based AI processing.

The decision, communicated to Members of the European Parliament (MEPs) in an internal memo this week, reflects a deepening unease at the heart of European institutions about how AI systems handle sensitive data.

The Parliament’s IT department concluded that it could not guarantee the safety of certain AI-driven functions, notably writing assistants, text summarization tools, virtual assistants, and web page summary features, because they rely on cloud-based processing that sends data off the device.

In a workplace where draft legislation, confidential correspondence, and internal deliberations circulate daily, even momentary exposure of sensitive information is viewed as unacceptable.

For now, the measures apply only to these native, built-in AI features on Parliament-issued tablets and smartphones, not to everyday apps like email or calendars. The institution has declined to specify which operating systems or device manufacturers are affected, citing the “sensitive nature” of cybersecurity matters.

The internal memo did more than announce a software rollback. It advised lawmakers to review AI settings on their personal phones and tablets, warning them against exposing work emails, documents, or internal information to AI tools that “scan or analyze content,” and urging caution with third-party AI applications that seek broad access to data.

This guidance implicitly acknowledges a larger truth: for many elected officials and staff, the boundary between official and personal devices is porous. The Parliament’s approach underscores that risks are not confined to issued hardware but extend into the consumer technology choices of its own members.

The move is the latest in a series of precautionary steps by EU institutions. In 2023 the Parliament banned the use of TikTok on staff devices over similar data concerns, and ongoing debates have questioned the use of foreign-developed productivity software. Some lawmakers have even suggested moving away from Microsoft products in favor of European alternatives, part of a broader push for digital sovereignty.

That push is not abstract. The EU’s Artificial Intelligence Act, the world’s first comprehensive regulatory framework on AI, has been in force since 2024 and imposes obligations on AI providers and users alike, categorizing systems by risk and demanding transparency, traceability, and human oversight.

Yet the Parliament’s latest action reveals a paradox: while Europe seeks to regulate and shape AI at scale, it is simultaneously wary of the very tools it aims to master. Stopping short of a full ban on AI use, the institution is essentially saying that in certain contexts, the technology is too unpredictable to trust, especially when critical information could leak outside secure boundaries.

The Parliament’s decision may seem narrowly targeted, but it carries broader implications. It signals that even for progressive regulators who have championed innovation alongside rights protections, the practical limits of AI integration are now a central concern. Cybersecurity teams within government institutions are not merely technologists; they are custodians of trust in an era when data is both an asset and a vulnerability.

For businesses and citizens watching Europe’s regulatory trajectory, this episode is instructive. It suggests that the EU’s approach to AI will not only be legal and ethical but deeply pragmatic. Regulations may promote responsible innovation, but European institutions are prepared to pull back when security and control are at stake.

As AI capabilities continue to evolve and become embedded in devices worldwide, the Parliament’s cautionary step highlights a core tension of the digital age: balancing the potential of AI with its unseen and unquantified risks.

Whether other governments follow suit, or whether this stance influences corporate and product strategy, remains to be seen. In the meantime, the message from Brussels is unmistakable: when it comes to AI and sensitive data, trust but verify is no longer enough.

            <h2>AI FOMO: Where the “I” is not just intelligence, but I, the human</h2>
            <p><strong>The Next Web | 2026-02-17</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://thenextweb.com/news/ai-fomo-where-the-i-is-not-just-intelligence-but-i-the-human">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">When FOMO ( fear of missing out) first entered popular language, it was about teenagers scrolling through friends’ social feeds and worrying they weren’t having as much fun. But today, that word has taken on a different meaning in the era of artificial intelligence.

The fear now isn’t about beach photos or party snapshots. It’s about being left behind in a technological revolution that promises dramatic changes in work, creativity, and competition. It’s about the feeling that your own intelligence is not enough anymore, and you can’t compete with the artificial one.

You might call it AI FOMO, the worry, for individuals and companies alike, that others are moving ahead with AI while you stand still. And this feeling is real enough that researchers are trying to understand it scientifically.

They’ve developed tools to measure how much people fear falling behind in AI skills or access. A recent study showing how this fear plays out found that more than one in nine adults report elevated levels of anxiety about not keeping up with AI, especially younger people and women. Importantly, those with better AI literacy reported less fear, suggesting that understanding the technology reduces anxiety.

This isn’t abstract psychological jargon. It is a psychological undercurrent that feels entirely modern: tied to the ubiquity of AI in press, policy, and venture capital. The sense that everyone must adopt intelligent technology or risk irrelevance. But like most anxieties, its influence extends far beyond individual nervousness.

I think we reached the point where AI FOMO is shaping business decisions, corporate strategy, and even public policy.

The ripples from AI FOMO extend far beyond individual stress. They reach into boardrooms and strategic plans where companies, whether big or small, are deciding how hard to pursue AI.

A survey by intelligent automation company ABBYY found that around 60-70 % of technology leaders report fear of missing out as a major reason their organisation is investing in AI. Many worry that if they don’t adopt AI now, competitors will seize an advantage. And together with the leaders’ fear, some decisions are coming that may affect the employees.

I will give credit. That fear can feel logical. After all, AI promises efficiency, insight, and new capabilities, even for thought less capable.

But when fear becomes the main reason for action, it warps strategy. Rather than asking “What problem are we solving with AI?”, decision-makers ask “Can we afford not to use AI?” This change from thoughtful problem-solving to panic-driven adoption creates an illusion of purpose where there may be none.

And the results can be underwhelming. Recent business surveys show that many companies are still struggling to see real returns from their AI investments. Some executives report that less than half of their AI projects deliver measurable impact, or struggle to even quantify it. That’s a sign that widespread adoption does not automatically translate into value, especially when the impetus to buy in comes from anxiety rather than strategy.

AI FOMO isn’t just a corporate phenomenon. It affects workers too. Research focused on attitudes in the workplace shows that employees who believe AI will reduce their autonomy or make their skills obsolete tend to experience fear of missing out on AI adoption alongside heightened job anxiety. This connects with broader concerns about technology and wellbeing at work: many people worry that AI might replace tasks or change job expectations without clarity.

That fear can influence behaviour, too. Anecdotal reports, such as research showing a significant share of workers using AI tools secretly to keep up with perceived expectations, reflect this sense of needing to keep pace, even in silence. It’s not just about skills; it’s about identity, worth, and belonging in a professional world that is moving so fast.

The result is a kind of feedback loop. Investment without strategy, momentum without direction. In the pursuit of not falling behind, many risk falling into the very inefficiency they hoped to avoid.

To navigate this moment with equanimity requires resisting the gravitational pull of fear. This is not a rejection of AI’s transformative potential. A large majority of business leaders still view AI as an opportunity, even as concerns about risk and readiness grow.

But recognising AI FOMO as a real force, not just a catchphrase, allows companies, governments, and individuals to ask better questions:

The answer, ultimately, is not to replace fear with oblivious optimism, but to replace reflexive action with intentional adoption.

In the end, AI FOMO tells us something deeper about ourselves than any quarterly earnings report or headline about the next breakthrough. It reveals how closely we have tied our hopes, and our anxieties, to a technology that is, for many of us, still only partly understood.

We see AI everywhere: pitched as productivity’s savior one moment, feared as a job-eating force the next. Across workplaces and dinner-table conversations alike, even on dating apps, the underlying emotion often isn’t excitement or dread alone, but something that feels curiously familiar and deeply human: the fear of falling behind, of being outpaced by peers, competitors, or even young strangers we’ve never met.

This feeling is more than a distraction or a fancy word. It is linked to genuine stress, anxiety, and reduced well-being for some, and it shapes behaviour in subtle but far-reaching ways. People tweak their resumes, accept rushed technology rollouts, or hunch over training modules long into the night; not because they are certain of the value, but because they fear the alternative.

This moment, then, feels like more than a fad. It is a crossroads between reaction and reflection. We can choose to let fear drive our choices, or we can treat that fear as a signal to slow down, learn, and make room for real understanding.

If I’ve learned anything in the years since AI leapt into the popular imagination, it’s this: technology changes fastest when we pair curiosity with clarity, and adapts most successfully when we meet it with empathy rather than anxiety.

So as the next wave of models arrives, as companies wordsmith their AI strategies, and as employees juggle training modules alongside tools and dashboards, here’s one gentle reminder worth holding onto: technology doesn’t define us. Our reactions to it do. We are the ones who imagine, experiment, hesitate, question, and decide.

            <div id="article-text">If you checked X today expecting the usual stream of hot takes, memes, and AI spats, you probably saw… nothing. A widespread outage hit the platform today, leaving feeds blank, timelines unresponsive, and users staring at the digital equivalent of an empty room.

Outage trackers such as Downdetector logged a dramatic surge in problem reports around midday GMT, with tens of thousands of users across regions, including the United States, the United Kingdom, Pakistan, and India, reporting problems accessing the service. Some described impossible login loops and error messages telling them only that “something went wrong.”

Here’s where it gets curious: nobody from X has confirmed why the platform hiccupped. Despite the scale of the disruption, and a global user base reliant on the service for everything from breaking news to weather alerts, there’s been no official timeline for a fix or even an acknowledgement of a broader issue. For a service that prides itself on instant updates, the silence is notable.

This isn’t the first time X has ground to a halt. The platform has a history of outages since its rebranding from Twitter, with users historically greeted by messages like “Something went wrong” when backend systems hiccup.

Today’s disruption even impacted associated tech. Reports suggest that Grok, the AI chatbot tied into X’s ecosystem, also faced interruptions as timelines failed to load, underscoring how much of the platform’s experience still depends on backend stability.

For now, the outage remains a developing story, and users left refreshing their browsers might be asking the most modern question of all: was it a bug, a server gremlin, or just another Monday on X?

            <h2>What my CS team was missing</h2>
            <p><strong>The Next Web | 2026-02-16</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://thenextweb.com/news/what-my-cs-team-was-missing">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">I need to say something that might make CS leaders uncomfortable: most of what your team does before a renewal is valuable, but it’s listening to only one channel. Your EBRs, your health scores, your stakeholder maps. They capture what your customer is willing to tell you directly. What they don’t capture is the conversation happening everywhere else. And that’s usually where churn starts.

I know because I ran the standard playbook for years. EBRs, stakeholder mapping, health score reviews, and renewal prep meetings, where we rated our gut feeling on a scale of green to red. We had dashboards. We had strong CSMs who genuinely cared about their accounts. And we still got blindsided.

The $2M quarter is the one I can’t forget. Two enterprise accounts churned in the same 90-day window. Both were green in every system we had. One had an NPS of 72.

When I dug into what happened, I didn’t find a CS execution problem. I found a coverage gap. Every signal had been there. Just not in the places our process was designed to look. I sat in the post-mortem knowing we’d done everything our process asked us to do. That was the problem.

Later in this article, I’ll show you what both of those accounts would have looked like inside Renewal Fix. Before anyone on my team knew there was a problem.

I’m not saying EBRs are useless. A well-run EBR builds relationship depth, gives your champion ammunition internally, and surfaces problems the customer is willing to raise directly. But even the best EBR has a structural limitation: it only captures what someone chooses to say out loud, in a meeting, to a vendor.

The real conversation about your product is happening in a Slack channel you’ll never see, in a procurement review you weren’t invited to, and in a 1:1 between your champion and their new boss who just joined from a company that used your competitor. The EBR gives you one essential channel. The danger is treating it as the only one.

Here’s what was actually happening in those two accounts that churned on me.

Account one: their engineering team had filed 23 support tickets about API latency over four months. Not “the product is broken” tickets. Small, specific, technical complaints that got resolved individually. Nobody in CS ever saw them because they never escalated to “critical.” But lined up chronologically, the pattern was unmistakable: this team was losing patience, one resolved ticket at a time.

Account two: three of their five power users updated their LinkedIn profiles in the same two-week window. One started posting about a competitor’s product. Our champion’s title changed from “Head of” to “Senior Manager.” A quiet demotion nobody noticed because we were watching product usage dashboards, not org charts.

Every CS leader I know has lost an account and later found out the champion left months ago. The customer’s reaction is always the same: “We assumed you knew.” They expect you to track publicly available professional changes, the same information any recruiter monitors. Not tracking them isn’t respectful. It’s a blind spot.

Neither signal lived in our CRM. Neither showed up in our health score. They were sitting in plain sight in systems our CS team had no reason to check.

Health scores aren’t the problem. Treating them as the whole picture is. A typical health score aggregates NPS, login frequency, support ticket count, and feature adoption. Green means safe. Red means act. But these are lagging indicators. By the time login frequency drops, the decision to evaluate alternatives may already be in motion.

When I started tracking leading indicators alongside our existing health model, the difference was striking. Across roughly 300 mid-market accounts over 18 months, we found that support ticket velocity, specifically the rate of increase in non-critical tickets over a rolling 90-day window, predicted churn at T-90 at roughly 2x the accuracy of our composite health score. The signals that actually predict churn aren’t the ones most CS platforms are designed to track.

The teams with the strongest renewal rates don’t abandon their existing processes. They add a signal layer on top. The highest-signal sources break into three tiers.

Tier 1: Support ticket patterns. Not the count, but the velocity, the sentiment trend, and whether the same team keeps filing. A steady trickle of “resolved” tickets from one engineering team is often a louder signal than a single P1 escalation. At scale, this becomes cohort-level complaint clustering across a segment.

Tier 2: People changes. Champion turnover, re-orgs, title changes, and new executives from a competitor’s customer base. The person who bought your product and the person renewing it are often not the same person. At scale, you’re watching for patterns of org instability across your book.

Tier 3: Competitive exposure. Whether your customer is being actively pitched, attending competitor events, or has team members engaging with competitor content online. At scale, you’re tracking which segments your competitors are targeting hardest.

The real challenge isn’t knowing what to track. It’s that these signals live in five or six different systems, and nobody’s job is to stitch them together. Your CSM sees Zendesk. Your SE sees Jira. Your AE sees Salesforce. The full picture only exists if someone manually assembles it.

One team I worked with built a manual version of this: CSMs logging signals from six different sources every Friday. About 90 minutes per account per week. Their renewal rate hit 96%. But the approach doesn’t scale past a 25-account book.

At 80 accounts in a mid-market motion, you need automation. At 150+ in a PLG model, the signals are still there, you’re watching for cohort-level drops in feature adoption or clusters of the same complaint across a segment, but you cannot find them without automation.

The teams doing this manually are logging into six tools every Friday. The teams doing this with automation get a Slack message when something changes. No dashboard to check. No Friday ritual.

Detection without a playbook is just anxiety. The point of catching signals early isn’t to panic. It’s to have time to act. An executive sponsor who hasn’t logged in for 90 days needs a different intervention than an account with a competitor POC in their Salesforce sandbox. The signal tells you what’s happening. The response has to match.

That gap between knowing what to track and actually tracking it consistently is why I built Renewal Fix. Not to replace the manual process, but to remove the ceiling on it. The platform pulls signals from support tickets, call recordings, CRM data, and engineering channels automatically, stitches them into a single account view, and flags them before they become a renewal surprise.

Enter your work email at renewalfix.com. In 30 seconds, you’ll get a one-page executive brief showing your blind spots: 10 accounts that look like they belong in your CS platform, built from your company’s products, competitive landscape, and integration stack, each with a health score and risk signals sourced from support tickets, call recordings, and org changes that your current dashboard would never surface. No demo, no sales call.

Find the account that looks most like Account One. Health score in the 70s, risk signals hiding underneath. Then click “Executive Brief” for a one-page summary of your portfolio’s total risk exposure, with dollar amounts and prioritized actions. That view is what Renewal Fix delivers weekly in production.

Your green accounts aren’t necessarily at risk. But they might be quieter than you realize.
