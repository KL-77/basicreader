            <h2>Senators count the shady ways data centers pass energy costs on to Americans</h2>
            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2025-12-16</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/12/shady-data-center-deals-doom-americans-to-higher-energy-bills-senators-say/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Senators launched a probe Tuesday demanding that tech companies explain exactly how they plan to prevent data center projects from increasing electricity bills in communities where prices are already skyrocketing.

In letters to seven AI firms, Senators Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.), and Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) cited a study estimating that “electricity prices have increased by as much as 267 percent in the past five years” in “areas located near significant data center activity.”

Prices increase, senators noted, when utility companies build out extra infrastructure to meet data centers’ energy demands—which can amount to one customer suddenly consuming as much power as an entire city. They also increase when demand for local power outweighs supply. In some cases, residents are blindsided by higher bills, not even realizing a data center project was approved, because tech companies seem intent on dodging backlash and frequently do not allow terms of deals to be publicly disclosed.

AI firms “ask public officials to sign non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) preventing them from sharing information with their constituents, operate through what appear to be shell companies to mask the real owner of the data center, and require that landowners sign NDAs as part of the land sale while telling them only that a ‘Fortune 100 company’ is planning an ‘industrial development’ seemingly in an attempt to hide the very existence of the data center,” senators wrote.

States like Virginia with the highest concentration of data centers could see average electricity prices increase by another 25 percent by 2030, senators noted. But price increases aren’t limited to the states allegedly striking shady deals with tech companies and greenlighting data center projects, they said. “Interconnected and interstate power grids can lead to a data center built in one state raising costs for residents of a neighboring state,” senators reported.

Under fire for supposedly only pretending to care about keeping neighbors’ costs low were Amazon, Google, Meta, Microsoft, Equinix, Digital Realty, and CoreWeave. Senators accused firms of paying “lip service,” claiming that they would do everything in their power to avoid increasing residential electricity costs, while actively lobbying to pass billions in costs on to their neighbors.

For example, Amazon publicly claimed it would “make sure” it would cover costs so they wouldn’t be passed on. But it’s also a member of an industry lobbying group, the Data Center Coalition, that “has opposed state regulatory decisions requiring data center companies to pay a higher percentage of costs upfront,” senators wrote. And Google made similar statements, despite having an executive who opposed a regulatory solution that would set data centers into their own “rate class”—and therefore responsible for grid improvement costs that could not be passed on to other customers—on the grounds that it was supposedly “discriminatory.”

“The current, socialized model of electricity ratepaying,” senators explained—where costs are shared across all users—”was not designed for an era where just one customer requires the same amount of electricity as some of the largest cities in America.”

Particularly problematic, senators emphasized, were reports that tech firms were getting discounts on energy costs as utility companies competed for their business, while prices went up for their neighbors.

Ars contacted all firms targeted by lawmakers. Four did not respond. Microsoft and Meta declined to comment. Digital Realty told Ars that it “looks forward to working with all elected officials to continue to invest in the digital infrastructure required to support America’s leadership in technology, which underpins modern life and creates high-paying jobs.”

Senators are likely exploring whether to pass legislation that would help combat price increases that they say cause average Americans to struggle to keep the lights on. They’ve asked tech companies to respond to their biggest questions about data center projects by January 12, 2026.

Among their top questions, senators wanted to know about firms’ internal projections looking forward with data center projects. That includes sharing their projected energy use through 2030, as well as the “impact of your AI data centers on regional utility costs.” Companies are also expected to explain how “internal projections of data center energy consumption” justify any “opposition to the creation of a distinct data center rate class.”

Additionally, senators asked firms to outline steps they’ve taken to prevent passing on costs to neighbors and details of any impact studies companies have conducted.

Likely to raise the most eyebrows, however, would be answers to questions about “tax deductions or other financial incentives” tech firms have received from city and state governments. Those numbers would be interesting to compare with other information senators demanded that companies share, detailing how much they’ve spent on lobbying and advocacy for data centers. Senators appear keen to know how much tech companies are paying to avoid covering a proportionate amount of infrastructure costs.

“To protect consumers, data centers must pay a greater share of the costs upfront for future energy usage and updates to the electrical grid provided specifically to accommodate data centers’ energy needs,” senators wrote.

Requiring upfront payment is especially critical, senators noted, since some tech firms have abandoned data center projects, leaving local customers to bear the costs of infrastructure changes without utility companies ever generating any revenue. Communities must also consider that AI firms’ projected energy demand could severely dip if enterprise demand for AI falls short of expectations, AI capabilities “plateau” and trigger widespread indifference, AI companies shift strategies “away from scaling computer power,” or chip companies “find innovative ways to make AI more energy-efficient.”

“If data centers end up providing less business to the utility companies than anticipated, consumers could be left with massive electricity bills as utility companies recoup billions in new infrastructure costs, with nothing to show for it,” senators wrote.

Already Utah, Oregon, and Ohio have passed laws “creating a separate class of utility customer for data centers which includes basic financial safeguards such as upfront payments and longer contract length,” senators noted, and Virginia is notably weighing a similar law.

At least one study, The New York Times noted, suggested that data centers may have recently helped reduce electricity costs by spreading the costs of upgrades over more customers, but those outcomes varied by state and could not account for future AI demand.

“It remains unclear whether broader, sustained load growth will increase long-run average costs and prices,” Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory researchers concluded. “In some cases, spikes in load growth can result in significant, near-term retail price increase.”

Until companies prove they’re paying their fair share, senators expect electricity bills to keep climbing, particularly in vulnerable areas. That will likely only increase pressure for regulators to intervene, the director of the Electricity Law Initiative at the Harvard Law School Environmental and Energy Law Program, Ari Peskoe, suggested in September.

“The utility business model is all about spreading costs of system expansion to everyone, because we all benefit from a reliable, robust electricity system,” Peskoe said. “But when it’s a single consumer that is using so much energy—basically that of an entire city—and when that new city happens to be owned by the wealthiest corporations in the world, I think it’s time to look at the fundamental assumptions of utility regulation and make sure that these facilities are really paying for all of the infrastructure costs to connect them to the system and to power them.”</div>

            <h2>Software leaks point to the first Apple Silicon “iMac Pro,” among other devices</h2>
            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2025-12-16</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/12/leaked-debug-kit-suggests-apple-is-testing-a-new-imac-pro-among-many-other-macs/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Apple doesn’t like to talk about its upcoming products before it’s ready, but sometimes the company’s software does the talking for it. So far this week we’ve had a couple of software-related leaks that have outed products Apple is currently testing—one a pre-release build of iOS 26, and the other some leaked files from a kernel debug kit (both via MacRumors).

Most of the new devices referenced in these leaks are straightforward updates to products that already exist: a new Apple TV, a HomePod mini 2, new AirTags and AirPods, an M4 iPad Air, a 12th-generation iPad to replace the current A16 version, next-generation iPhones (including the 17e, 18, and the rumored foldable model), a new Studio Display model, some new smart home products we’ve already heard about elsewhere, and M5 updates for the MacBook Air, Mac mini, Mac Studio, and the other MacBook Pros. There’s also yet another reference to the lower-cost MacBook that Apple is apparently planning to replace the M1 MacBook Air it still sells via Walmart for $599.

For power users, though, the most interesting revelation might be that Apple is working on a higher-end Apple Silicon iMac powered by an M5 Max chip. The kernel debug kit references an iMac with the internal identifier J833c, based on a platform identified as H17C—and H17C is apparently based on the M5 Max, rather than a lower-end M5 chip. (For those who don’t have Apple’s branding memorized, “Max” is associated with Apple’s second-fastest chips; the M5 Max would be faster than the M5 or M5 Pro, but slower than the rumored M5 Ultra.)

This device could be the long-awaited, occasionally-rumored-but-never-launched replacement to Apple’s 27-inch iMac, which was discontinued in 2022 with no direct replacement. An M5 Max chip would also make this machine the closest thing we’ve seen to a direct replacement for the iMac Pro, a 27-inch iMac variant that was launched in late 2017 but likewise discontinued without an update or replacement.

The current M4 Max chip includes 14 or 16 CPU cores, 32 or 40 GPU cores, and between 36GB and 128GB of unified memory, specs we’d expect an M5 Max to match or beat. And because the Max chips already fit into the 14- and 16-inch MacBook Pros, it should be no problem to fit one into an all-in-one desktop PC.

For most of the Intel era, the 27-inch iMac was Apple’s main workhorse desktop, situated in between the underpowered Mac mini and the expensive, oft-ignored Mac Pro. It used high-end multi-core CPUs and midrange dedicated GPUs, and combined them with a high-end color-accurate 5K screen that was good enough for all kinds of professional photo and video editing and design work.

But the Apple Silicon era saw the iMac revert to its roots as a less-powerful, colorful, consumer-friendly system aimed at less-demanding users. The current Apple M4 iMac is pleasant to use and plenty fast for everyday computing tasks, but it can’t stack up to desktops like the M4 Pro Mac mini or the Mac Studio.

For several years, rumors persisted that Apple was working on an upgraded iMac—Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman said in 2023 that a 32-inch version of the iMac could possibly launch at some point in 2024 or 2025. That timeline ended up being optimistic, but the presence of an M5 Max in this testing model suggests that a 2026 launch could be a real possibility.

Apple offers products that can replace a 27-inch iMac in its lineup today—either a Mac mini or Mac Studio, connected to a 27-inch 5K Studio Display or the 32-inch 6K Pro Display XDR. But that combination can’t replace an iMac for the people who enjoy the all-in-one’s clean look or its lack of cable clutter, and both of those aging standalone displays are missing support for the kinds of technologies offered in modern high-end screens, including mini LED or OLED panels or ProMotion refresh rates.

That this iMac and these other devices are present in these internal software builds doesn’t mean that they’re things Apple intends to release—just that Apple is testing some version of them in its headquarters somewhere, and that work has progressed to the point where Apple is supporting them with internal software releases. They could see the light of day soon, or years from now, or never at all. But for anyone who’s still keeping hope alive about a 27-inch iMac replacement, this is another piece of kindling you can use to try and keep that fire burning.</div>

            <h2>Reporter suggests Half-Life 3 will be a Steam Machine launch title</h2>
            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2025-12-16</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/12/journalist-insists-half-life-3-will-launch-with-steam-machine-in-spring-2026/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">If you can take your mind way back to the beginning of 2025, you might remember a fresh wave of rumors suggesting that Half-Life 3 was finally reaching the final stages of production, and could be announced and/or released at any moment. Now, though, 2025 seems set to come to a close without any official news of a game fans have been waiting literal decades for.

That doesn’t necessarily mean a Half-Life 3 announcement and/or release isn’t imminent, though. On the contrary, veteran journalist Mike Straw insisted on a recent Insider Gaming podcast that “everybody I’ve talked to are still adamant [Half-Life 3] is a game that will be a launch title with the Steam Machine.”

Straw—who has a long history of reporting gaming rumors from anonymous sources—said this Half-Life 3 information is “not [from] these run-of-the-mill sources that haven’t gotten me information before. … These aren’t like random, one-off people.” And those sources are “still adamant that the game is coming in the spring,” Straw added, noting that he was “specifically told [that] spring 2026 [is the window] for the Steam Machine, for the Frame, for the Controller, [and] for Half-Life 3.”

Tying the long-awaited Half-Life 3 to a major hardware push that has already been announced for an “early 2026” window certainly sounds plausible, given previous leaks about the game’s advanced state of development. But there are still some reasons to doubt Straw’s “adamant” sources here.

For one, Straw admitted that the previous information he had received on potential Half-Life 3 launch and/or announcement dates was not reliable enough to report in detail. “I had been told a date. I was not going to report that date because they weren’t 100 percent confident in that date,” he said. “That date has since passed.”

“It was one of those situations where I guarantee a bunch of people were just giving out dates to see who would post a date to catch who was leaking said information,” Straw added. “The date they told me, there’s a reason why they said, ‘Don’t report it.’ I didn’t write a story on it because there just was not enough on the date itself to run a story… I didn’t feel comfortable officially reporting that.”

And even if Straw’s information about a “spring 2026” window for Half-Life 3 is currently correct, the ever-shifting nature of Valve Time means those plans could still change. That is especially true if the game’s launch is linked to hardware plans that might be impacted by the spiking price of RAM.

Straw said that kind of component uncertainty—and negative reactions to reports of PC-style pricing for the Steam Machine—are likely pushing Valve toward “holding back the idea or holding back the announcement of anything else” surrounding Steam Machine launch details. “There’s no doubt in my mind Valve is still trying to make decisions because of what’s going on on the component side,” he added.

Timing specifics aside, Straw said his sources have him convinced that the long wait for Half-Life 3 is coming to an end in the near future. “The game’s real,” he said. “At the end of the day, the game is real. There’s no denying it. It’s just a ‘when’ and not an ‘if’ at this point.”</div>

            <div id="article-text">AI cloud computing company CoreWave exploded onto the scene in March with the biggest tech IPO since 2021.

The company’s stock soared by more than 40 percent in the following days, riding on the coattails of immense hype surrounding generative AI. The hype was driven by insatiable AI companies like Microsoft, OpenAI, and Meta leasing hundreds of megawatts of compute as outfits like CoreWeave construct enormous data centers.

If AI chipmaker Nvidia is the one selling shovels during the ongoing AI gold rush, in other words, CoreWeave is the one buying those shovels in bulk and leasing access to the digging sites.

But persistent fears of an AI bubble have put a massive damper on investor enthusiasm, leaving many to wonder whether CoreWeave could be the canary in the coalmine — and even drawing comparisons to Enron, a company with an extremely speculative valuation that imploded following a major accounting scandal in 2001.

As the Wall Street Journal reports, CoreWeave’s share price has plunged 46 percent in just six weeks, with $33 billion of value going up in smoke. At press time, shares are hovering at just under $70, meaning the company has lost a staggering 56 percent of its stock value in just six months.

It may well be a sign that investors are jittery that the enormous spending by the likes of CoreWeave may not be justified in the long run. Even AI leaders have warned that a return may still be many years out, with OpenAI admitting last month that it won’t make any money until at least 2030.

It doesn’t take much reading between the lines to understand why they’re nervous. Taking on an enormous amount of high-interest debt to construct and lease AI data centers leaves the firm with a considerable degree of risk, potentially putting it first on the chopping block in case the AI bubble were to implode.

Its operations are also meeting some major headwinds, both literally and figuratively. Rainstorms in Texas forced the company to delay the pouring of a foundation for an AI data center complex, pushing back the completion date by months, the WSJ reports.

Investors have also balked at circular financing arrangements in the sector. For instance, Nvidia owns six percent of the company’s shares, while CoreWeave has signed an exclusivity contract with the AI chipmaker to only use its GPUs. Microsoft represented 62 percent of CoreWeave’s 2024 revenue, as the Wall Street Journal pointed out last month, and is also a major shareholder of CoreWeave’s top customer, OpenAI.

Then there’s CoreWeave CEO Michael Intrator, who downplayed those fears last month.

“If you’re building something that accelerates the economy and has fundamental value to the world, the world will find ways to finance an enormous amount of business,” he said at a Wall Street Journal event in early November.

Days after downplaying concerns over an AI bubble, Intrator was probed by investors during a quarterly earnings call about the delays at the Texas data center construction site.

He argued that “there are 32 data centers in our portfolio,” and that “this one data center will catch up, and then we will move forward from there.”

As per the WSJ, the company’s CFO, Nitin Agrawal, was forced to intervene and clarify that there were delays plaguing several data centers for a single “data center provider.”

Investors are also concerned that the enormous amount of debt being taken on could compound significantly due to supply chain bottlenecks. Delays may not sound like a big deal in the grand scheme of things, but considering how much money and interest are on the line, an enormous amount of pressure is on CoreWeave to deliver some good news.

“The bull case is that they’ll scale into it, and that a lot of companies have low margins to start, but this is a company at scale,” DA Davidson analyst Gil Luria told the WSJ. “There is no scaling going on here.”

            <h2>Washington Post Says It Will Continue AI-Generating Error Filled Podcasts as Its Own Editors Groan in Embarrassment</h2>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The outcry sparked by the Washington Post’s launch of AI-generated podcasts has gone in one ear of the newspaper’s leadership and out the other, which isn’t too dissimilar to what might happen to anyone listening to the slop it’s trying to peddle.

On Monday, the Jeff Bezos-owned publication doubled down on its personalized podcasts push, brushing aside the criticism from readers and its own reporters alike.

“This is how products get built and developed in the digital age: ideation, research, design and prototyping, development, and then Beta,” a WaPo spokesperson told TheWrap.  “Only if they prove to be successful for the customer do they then get launched. As stated clear on Your Personal Podcast, it is currently in Beta.”

WaPo launched its “Your Personal Podcast” feature last week, sparking immediate dissent in its ranks. Staffers were furious about the podcast AI inventing and misattributing quotes, Semafor reported Friday, and even sometimes editorializing on stories. Some staffers questioned the tech’s seemingly nonexistent guardrails, Status reported, while another described it as a “total disaster.”

Further underscoring the staggering incompetence on display, followup reporting from Semafor revealed that WaPo had conducted its own tests prior to launching which showed that up to 84 percent of the AI-generated podcasts scripts didn’t meet the newspaper’s standards — and were therefore unpublishable.

There’s a significant disconnect between the company’s newsroom and its product team in charge of the AI rollout. The podcast’s product team sees the errors as a normal part of rolling out a new and still experimental feature, and said it would “iterate through the remaining issues.”

Similar jargon was on display in the paper’s statement to TheWrap, and it’s equal parts telling and jarring that such tech-minded rhetoric is being deployed in the context of journalism. The AI may not be doing the work of an actual journalist, but it’s taking over the role of packaging the news to listeners. Would a human news anchor be given this much leeway, and be allowed to screw up more details than they get right because they’re learning on the job, or in tech parlance, “iterating through it”?

The Post isn’t the only newsroom deploying AI. The New York Times uses it to help generate headlines, and Bloomberg’s website features an AI that summarizes its articles. Many publications have some form of AI chatbot trained on their archives. But WaPo has been particularly AI-evangelistic, signifying its transformation under Jeff Bezos’ ownership. Along with deploying AI summaries and an AI chatbot, it also put forth a plan for letting non-professional writers submit articles written with AI.

The AI podcasts, however, seem to really have struck a nerve with its staff.

“It is truly astonishing that this was allowed to go forward at all,” one WaPo editor fumed on Slack, per Semafor. “Never would I have imagined that the Washington Post would deliberately warp its own journalism and then push these errors out to our audience at scale.”

“If we were serious, we would pull this tool immediately,” the editor added.

            <h2>We’re Bracing for an Accident Now That Tesla Is Taking the Safety Drivers Out of Its Robotaxis</h2>
            <p><strong>Futurism | 2025-12-16</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://futurism.com/advanced-transport/tesla-removing-safety-drivers-robotaxis">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Tesla is preparing for its Robotaxis to go fully driverless and ditch its human safety monitors, according to CEO Elon Musk, while the rest of us prepare for an accident.

Over the weekend, footage circulated on social media showing at least two different Tesla Robotaxis roaming the streets of Austin, Texas, without anyone in the driver’s seat. Musk soon stepped in to confirm what his fans were seeing.

“Testing is underway with no occupants in the car,” Musk wrote in a tweet Sunday.

If true, then the automaker is finally gearing up to belatedly deliver on Musk’s grand promise to get rid of the safety monitors, who have always been a conspicuous and embarrassing inclusion, by the end of 2025. Musk has insisted that Tesla included monitors because it was “paranoid” about safety, but the service’s delayed launch this June, plus Tesla’s struggles with its existing self-driving tech, added to the feeling that they were really there to paper over the Robotaxi’s dubious capabilities.

That the safety monitors are now set to be removed will raise serious questions about whether the tech is reliable enough to operate on its own. The human supervisors have already had to make a number of interventions to prevent a potential accident or stop them breaking road laws. They’ve even taken complete control of the vehicles on occasion.

It doesn’t help that Tesla isn’t nearly as transparent about its tech as robot cab leader Waymo. Tesla heavily censors its crash reports sent to regulators under the guise of protecting “confidential business information,” making it impossible to determine what occurred during the accidents. Many of the reports come in months after the fact, and the automaker has been investigated by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration for failing to report crashes on time.

The data that we are privy to, though, isn’t flattering. As of this week, as spotted by Electrek, the automaker has reported eight crashes since launching the service in late June (and to give an idea of how tardy the updates are, the latest reported crash occurred in October.) Four crashes occurred in a single month.

Electrek crunched the numbers and estimated that based on Tesla’s November announcement that its fleet had traveled a combined 250,000 miles, the Robotaxis were crashing once every 40,000 miles. For comparison, Waymo’s over 2,500 autonomous taxis, which operate across several major metropolitan areas, like Los Angeles, the Bay Area, and Austin, have racked up over 100 million fully driverless miles — with no safety monitor or driver — and crash every 98,600 miles on average, per Electrek.

All that being said, Musk has a storied track record of making grand promises he can’t deliver on. Originally, he declared that the Robotaxi service would launch with fully “unsupervised” rides with “no one in the car,” thus making it a huge embarrassment when the cabs eventually rolled out with safety monitors’ in the front passenger seat.

Musk also claimed that over 1,000 Tesla Robotaxis would be patrolling Austin “within a few months” of launching, and estimated that over a million self-driving Teslas would be deployed across the US by the end of 2026 after he releases the Robotaxi software to Tesla owners. Right now, there’s only around 30 Robotaxis in operation.

In other words, we wouldn’t put it past Musk to yoink the safety monitors, but it could very well be the case he’s just throwing a bone to his fans-slash-investors to keep stringing them along. And it worked: Tesla shares soared by up to five percent to an almost year-high after Musk’s announcement, Reuters reported.

“The news Tesla is testing Robotaxis without the safety monitors is in line with our expectations that the company is making progress in its testing, in line with management’s statements during the third quarter earnings call,” Seth Goldstein, senior equity analyst at Morningstar, told the newswire. “The market is cheering the progress.”

            <div id="article-text">It’s nice to remember that not everything on the internet needs to be a subscription-based platform with ads. On WikiFlix, a Netflix-inspired archive of public domain films, you can watch movies like “It’s a Wonderful Life” and “Noseferatu” for free. You don’t even have to make an account! Crazy, right?

A project of Wikipedia’s volunteer community, WikiFlix hosts over four thousand movies from Wikimedia Commons, the Internet Archive, or YouTube that have fallen into the public domain — that means they are free to share and distribute, usually because the copyright lapsed, or there was never any copyright at all. So, yes, most of the movies on the WikiFlix homepage are your grandma’s age, but isn’t it kind of fun to imagine what Netflix would’ve been like back in the day?

WikiFlix isn’t new, but it’s new to us, courtesy of a TikTok by Annie Rauwerda, the creator behind the “Depths of Wikipedia” accounts.

Your favorite website should be wikiflix.toolforge.org !!!!!!

While WikiFlix can introduce you to historic films like “Wings,” the first movie to win the Academy Award for Best Picture, there’s also a bunch of hidden gems on there. As Rauwerda says in her TikTok, “Sometimes I really like watching things that I know nobody else is watching, because what if I discover something crazy?”

On its homepage, WikiFlix prioritizes movies that have a lot of sitelinks on their Wikipedia pages, since those are more likely to be popular or interesting. But there is some degree of curation. The community around WikiFlix maintains a blacklist, which helps ensure that you’re not going to run into an historical Nazi propaganda film during your next “WikiFlix and chill” night. (“While these [films] are perfectly fine in an educational context, WikiFlix is more focused on entertainment,” a Wikiflix page says.)

WikiFlix content may not exactly be as binge-worthy as “Stranger Things,” but give it a try. Why not watch a Soviet musical inspired by Cinderella, a silent film about swashbuckling pirates, or a Japanese post-apocalyptic film that features a guy who somehow played for both the Boston Celtics and the Chicago Cubs? You can always catch up on “Love is Blind” another time.

            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/16/x-updates-its-terms-files-countersuit-to-lay-claim-to-the-twitter-trademark-after-newcomers-challenge/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Elon Musk’s X is updating its Terms of Service to indicate it still lays claim to the “Twitter” trademark. The move to add this detail to the company’s terms follows an announcement from a Virginia-based startup, which recently filed an application to trademark the term “Twitter.”

The startup, Operation Bluebird, claims that X had abandoned the brand “Twitter” by renaming its social networking service “X.” In its petition to the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office filed on December 2, the startup pointed to a post from X owner Musk on July 23, 2023, which proclaimed that the social network would soon “bid adieu to the twitter brand.”

X is now challenging that claim with a countersuit of its own. (A copy of the filing was shared with TechCrunch via IP trademark law firm Gerben IP; it’s not yet showing in PACER as of the time of publication.) In the filing, X says that it continues to exclusively own the Twitter and Tweet trademarks and the bluebird logo.

Since filing its petition for cancellation, Operation Bluebird has been collecting potential user sign-ups for its own social network at a website named Twitter.new. The effort is headed up by two lawyers, including founder Michael Peroff, based in Illinois, and Stephen Coates, previously a trademark lawyer at Twitter. Given their backgrounds, their assertion that they plan to launch a new service to rival X seems dubious. It’s more likely they want to acquire the trademark, which has value of its own.

Nevertheless, X isn’t taking its chances. Its revised Terms of Service, effective as of January 15, 2026, states:

“Nothing in the Terms gives you a right to use the X name or Twitter name or any of the X or Twitter trademarks, logos, domain names, other distinctive brand features, and other proprietary rights, and you may not do so without our express written consent.”

Previously, the terms only referenced X in this section. There was no mention of Twitter.

The terms additionally include other, more minor updates, including mentions related to EU laws and generated content. X’s Privacy Policy was also updated with a couple of references to age assurance technology.

This article was updated with a link to the countersuit following its initial publication.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">A recent study published by Consumer Reports alleges that Instacart has been conducting AI-led dynamic pricing experiments that, in some cases, are drastically inflating the cost of certain products.

CR and its research partner, Groundwork Collaborative, found that the delivery app was conducting these experiments at the platform’s retail partner locations — places like Kroger, Albertsons, Costco and Safeway. In some cases, consumers were paying as much as 23% more than other shoppers for the exact same product, the report says.

The software involved in the experiments, Eversight, is a SaaS product that offers grocers a retail pricing suite designed to “unlock revenue growth” and capitalize on “pricing solutions that scale your pricing strategy and uncover optimal prices your customers expect.” Instacart discloses on its Eversight page that some shoppers “may see slightly higher prices” than others.

However, as previously noted, some of those price hikes seem slightly higher than “slightly higher.” A 23% price hike isn’t exactly chump change.

When reached for comment, Instacart referred TechCrunch to a previously released statement in which the company noted that “just as retailers have long tested prices in physical stores to understand what resonates with customers, a small subset of our retail partners – 10 U.S. retail partners that already choose to apply markups – use Instacart’s Eversight technology to run limited online pricing tests.”

Dynamic pricing has become increasingly common in recent years, and many big e-commerce sites have been accused of employing it. Another recent report claimed that, due to dynamic pricing used by Amazon, school districts across the U.S. have been paying higher prices for basic school supplies. Amazon has since called the report “flawed and misleading.”

            <h2>The Commute Penalty</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2025-12-16</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/family/2025/12/commute-gender-wage-gap-mothers/685265/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">For all of the professional gains women have made over the past several decades, one stubborn measure of inequality—the gender wage gap—has been especially difficult to stamp out. And it’s a disparity that can be traced in large part to parenthood. In nearly every country on Earth, the arrival of children tends to coincide with a lasting drop in employment and earnings for moms but not dads. Conversations about how to better support working mothers typically focus on family policy, such as subsidized child care and paid parental leave. But one significant factor affecting moms’ employment remains under-discussed: the commute.

This is, admittedly, not a terribly sexy topic. But a growing body of research suggests that whether a mom can hang on to her job comes down to how long it takes her to get there. Notably, the crucial role that travel time plays in shaping maternal employment has been identified not only in the United States but also in countries with far more robust family policies and social safety nets. Commutes also affect women up and down the socioeconomic scale (though in different ways).

The negative influence of the commute is so pronounced that it’s hard to imagine making the economy work for moms without acknowledging its impact. And the solution to the commute penalty may be as daunting as it is simple: To help moms work outside the home, society needs to make it easier for them to work near home.

The commute is, to a great extent, a modern phenomenon. But mobility constraints have been governing the kind of work that women undertake for a long time. Roughly half a century ago, the anthropologist Judith K. Brown observed that throughout history, women gravitated toward jobs with characteristics that made them compatible with child care: They tended not to require “rapt concentration,” were relatively repetitive and easy to interrupt and resume, and didn’t require the woman to stray terribly far from home. In postindustrial societies, many of the requirements Brown cited for making work compatible with child-rearing have become less relevant; women work in all sorts of industries requiring focused concentration, for example. But distance from home—which of course affects commute time—may play a larger role in employment-based gender inequality than ever, as other factors, such as gaps in education between men and women, have declined in significance.

The study that seems to have kicked off much of the research on commutes was published about a decade ago. It found that in U.S. cities with longer average commute times, married women’s workforce-participation rates tended to be lower. A couple of years ago, researchers attempted to replicate the finding with more detailed data, drawn from 272 cities across the country, and found that it held up: A 10-minute increase in average commute time decreases by 4.4 percentage points the probability that married women in the area work. The effect was driven pretty much entirely by moms, rose with the number of children they had, and was bigger for those with younger children. “I think it’s very strong evidence that commuting is bad,” Jordi Jofre-Monseny, a co-author of the study, told me, “but particularly for women.”

Read: Why parents struggle so much in the world’s richest country

Even when commuting doesn’t push moms to leave the workforce entirely, it can shape the sorts of jobs they take. One recently published working paper used an unusually rich data set to document the career moves that people make before and after becoming parents. It found that before parenthood, men and women both tend to make steady progress in their career, moving to better-paying companies and to higher-paying jobs within those companies. But after children enter the picture, moms (not dads) start shifting to jobs at lower-paying employers, or to entirely different industries; for instance, moms may move out of finance into health care or education. Mothers seem to be trading lower pay for flexibility or other accommodations, Brenden Timpe, an economics professor at the University of Nebraska at Lincoln and a co-author of the paper, told me. He and his colleagues found that many moms moving to lower-paying employers were opting for jobs with part-time hours, more opportunities for remote work—and shorter commutes.

These findings are not unique to the United States. A 2022 study of data from Belgium found that, as in many other countries, a substantial employment gap opens between men and women after parenthood—largely because moms are so much more likely than dads to leave jobs outside their local area. A study this year, using data from Norway, found that after having a child, mothers reduce their commute time considerably more than fathers do, leaving them with fewer and lower-quality job opportunities. And a paper last year, looking at Germany, found that women’s willingness to sacrifice wages for a shorter commute jumps by 130 percent after they have a child and does not start to decline again until the child reaches age 12.

Collectively, these studies suggest that commuting is a hindrance to employment for moms regardless of their socioeconomic status, but that the manner in which they downshift their career varies. One paper, published in June, found that mothers without a college degree are much more likely than college-educated moms to leave the workforce on account of a long commute. Timpe’s paper, meanwhile, observed that among those moms who remained in the workforce but switched to lower-paying jobs (for benefits such as a shorter commute), the highest-paid took the largest hit. “If you think about people working at, you know, Goldman Sachs, that’s really where you see the biggest drops,” Timpe said. And of course, some moms don’t have the option of leaving the labor market: Another paper found that although commute distance widens the gender wage gap among all moms, the effect is a bit smaller among single moms, who likely have no choice but to carry on working, regardless of how terrible traffic is.

It’s worth spelling out why commuting is such a headache for parents. For one, the longer your commute, the more child care you are likely to need and the less time you get to spend with your kids. But many of the researchers I spoke with for this article believed that the draw of a short commute has less to do with the time people might save in a typical day and more to do with their ability to reliably show up for their kids.

Getting to day care or school pickup on time is an essential part of the parenting gig; long commutes heighten the risk of something, whether traffic or a train delay, causing a holdup. Even if a child doesn’t need their parent for midday errands or emergencies every day, on any day, they might need a parent: Kids get sick, have a doctor appointment, forget their lunch box, or have an assembly or other event that calls for parents’ presence. “All these activities take time, and they might be increasingly difficult to perform in a situation where just going back and forth from work requires you 45 minutes or one hour,” Ilaria D’Angelis, an economics professor at the University of Massachusetts at Boston and a co-author of the June paper, told me. And although the need to reach a child quickly may come up relatively infrequently, Timpe said, “You kind of have to make a huge employment decision based on that.” One parent may end up adjusting or limiting their work to ensure they can stay in proximity to their kids—and statistically speaking, it’s usually the mom.

The long-commute phenomenon might be made less punitive for women if more men were to modify their career to stick close to the kids. But that doesn’t so much solve the problem as redistribute it; if more dads were to take the hit, the commute burden would simply shift to them, rather than helping more parents, whether moms or dads, work higher-paying jobs. One potential fix: Employers could offer flexible hours, or reduce the career-hampering effect of commutes by allowing more employees to work from home. Such flexibility is probably one reason that commuting is less likely to push highly educated women out of the labor market, D’Angelis said; such women generally have a better chance of finding work that can be done remotely. For those without the ability to work from home, efforts to reduce congestion or invest in faster and more reliable public transportation—worthy goals, though much harder to attain—would almost certainly help.

Yet another option would be to find ways to enable people to live closer to where they work. One recent study, examining how the commute penalty is linked to the spatial distribution of jobs, found something that is going to sound blindingly obvious but that is worth teasing out: A mom’s preference for a short commute penalizes her only when acting on it means sacrificing a higher-wage opportunity. Consider the finance industry, in which the good jobs are typically concentrated in city centers. Sitian Liu, an economics professor at Queen’s University in Ontario, Canada, told me that among financial workers living in U.S. city centers, one doesn’t see much of a gender wage gap or a commute penalty. That makes sense because if you live in the financial district, the need or desire for a short commute has little bearing on women’s ability to access high-paying jobs. Only among finance workers in the suburbs does a large gender commuting gap—and a resulting gender wage gap—emerge.

But things look different in other high-skill, high-paying industries, such as medicine. Balancing work and parenthood as a physician, for instance, is no easy feat, no matter one’s distance from the workplace. Because hospitals and doctors’ offices are more geographically distributed, however, female doctors are less likely than finance workers to be penalized for living in the suburbs, Liu explained; those who decide to live outside the city still have access to high-paying, nearby jobs. Together, these findings point to two ways to minimize the commute penalty: Make it easier for more moms to live closer to existing job hubs—perhaps by building more family-friendly housing in urban centers—or spread the jobs out.

Motherhood will likely always shape women’s involvement in the economy. But the commute-penalty research demonstrates that moms’ ability to work depends greatly on practical, often malleable, aspects of how that work fits into their daily life. When mothers are “in a situation where they can really reconcile their family life with their work life,” D’Angelis said, “they do that.” The task for a society intent on reducing gender pay inequality is to create the conditions where that type of reconciliation is possible.</div>

            <h2>Trump’s Inferno of Hate Is Intensifying</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2025-12-16</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/2025/12/trump-rob-reiner/685280/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The actor and director Rob Reiner and his wife, the producer and photographer Michele Singer Reiner, were found stabbed to death in their home on Sunday. Yesterday, their son Nick, who has spoken about his bouts of drug addiction and homelessness, was arrested on suspicion of murder. With that news, a terrible event became doubly tragic.  Reiner was beloved by almost everyone who knew him. On social media, friends described him as generous, kind, funny, and a caring soul. The One Tree Hill actress Sophia Bush called him an “almost indescribably wonderful man.”  But none of that mattered to Donald Trump, who tore into the murdered Hollywood star.  On Truth Social, President Trump described Reiner as “a tortured and struggling, but once very talented movie director and comedy star.” He added, without a shred of evidence, that Reiner’s death was “reportedly due to the anger he caused others through his massive, unyielding, and incurable affliction with a mind crippling disease known as TRUMP DERANGEMENT SYNDROME.” And just to be sure he was clear, Trump continued: “He was known to have driven people CRAZY by his raging obsession of President Donald J. Trump.”

A few hours later, standing in the Oval Office, Trump was asked about the backlash to his comments. Instead of apologizing, he ramped up his attacks. “Well, I wasn’t a fan of his at all,” he said. “He was a deranged person, as far as Trump is concerned. He said—he knew it was false; in fact, it’s the exact opposite—that I was a friend of Russia, controlled by Russia. You know, it was the Russia hoax. He was one of the people behind it. I think he hurt himself, career-wise. He became like a deranged person. Trump Derangement Syndrome. So I was not a fan of Rob Reiner at all, in any way, shape, or form. I thought he was very bad for our country.”

None of this should be surprising. In 2015, Trump, a draft dodger, said that Republican Senator John McCain, a decorated Navy pilot who was a prisoner of war in Vietnam for more than five years, was “not a war hero.” Trump said McCain was only considered a hero “because he was captured,” adding, “I like people that weren’t captured.” He kept criticizing McCain even after the Arizona senator died. And during a political rally in 2019, he suggested that the late John Dingell, a Democrat who was the longest-serving member of Congress in American history, was looking up from hell. (Trump held a grudge against Dingell’s widow, Debbie, who succeeded her husband in the House.) He has made hundreds, maybe even thousands, of similar comments over the past decade. But if anything, Trump’s barbarity is getting worse, not better. As he ages, his inferno of hate intensifies.

At this stage, more than 10 years after Trump first descended a gold-rimmed escalator into the political scene, there is a temptation to dismiss his comments because they have become commonplace. Don’t let Trump live rent-free in your head, some on the right advise. Don’t waste time chasing his foolish and cruel comments, some of his critics warn. It’s oxygen to him. His defenders insist he’s the P. T. Barnum of American politics, a brilliant self-promoter and showman, and that it’s a mistake to pay too much attention to his words.

In fact, it’s a mistake to ignore them. Trump’s malignant narcissism is the most essential thing to understand about him.

Heraclitus taught that character is destiny. In Trump’s case, his sociopathy is destiny. His narcissism; his lack of conscience, remorse, or empathy; his pathological lying and grandiosity; his sense of entitlement, impulsivity, and aggression; his cruelty, predatory behavior, and sadism—these are the forces that drive him. If we don’t understand that, we understand almost nothing of importance about him. And beware: When a man with Trump’s personality feels caged in, when he feels besieged and abandoned and begins to lose control of events, he becomes more desperate and more dangerous.

Trump’s personal flaws have seeped into the MAGA movement he leads, which now controls the Republican Party. Megyn Kelly, the former Fox News anchor who, after she flamed out at NBC, has remade herself into a podcaster and ingratiated herself into MAGA world, offers a useful case study of how this works in practice.

Last month, Kelly spoke with the journalist Mark Halperin about American military strikes in the Caribbean, targeting boats that the Trump administration alleges carry “narco-terrorists” coming from Venezuela. She claimed the boats were carrying fentanyl, even though fentanyl does not come through the Caribbean. And then she weighed in on reports that two people who were clinging to the wreckage of an initial boat strike waved their arms toward the drone before they were killed in a follow-up strike. “I really do kind of not only want to see them killed in the water, whether they’re on the boat or in the water, but I’d really like to see them suffer,” she said. “I would like Trump and Hegseth to make it last a long time so they lose a limb and bleed out.”

That is sadism delivered from a $10 million mansion with a custom-built studio that includes a chic bar cart and is painted in the signature red of Kelly’s production company, Devil May Care Media.

Trump sets the pace, and his apparatchiks follow. Many of them have gained power and made money dumping toxic sewage into our civic water supply. But their devotion comes at a personal cost. Those who relish cruelty, who take special delight in dehumanizing others, are engaging in self-harm of a certain kind. “When we desecrate the divinity of others,” the author Brené Brown wrote, “we desecrate our own, and we betray our humanity.”

“Those who are kind benefit themselves,” the author of Proverbs put it, “but the cruel bring ruin on themselves.”

When he was asked about the killing of Charlie Kirk earlier this year, Reiner seemed genuinely aghast. His first response to learning of the murder, Reiner said, was “absolute horror.” It was beyond belief, he said. “That should never happen to anybody. I don’t care what your political beliefs are—that’s not acceptable. That’s not a solution to solving problems.”

Reiner was particularly moved by Erika Kirk’s eulogy for her husband. “I’m Jewish, but I believe in the teachings of Jesus and I believe in ‘do unto others’ and I believe in forgiveness,” he said. “And what she said, to me, was beautiful. She forgave his assassin, and I think that is admirable.”

Read: Rob Reiner was a quiet titan of storytelling

Reiner showed empathy and compassion for a murdered political opponent, Charlie Kirk, and extended grace and praise to Kirk’s widow. Donald Trump, conversely, showed a level of viciousness toward Reiner in death that we rarely see in anyone, and have never before seen in an American president. And yet Trump is president mainly because of the early and undying support he has received from white evangelical Christians and fundamentalists, not all of them but most of them. They stand with him to this very day, to this very hour, to this very second—not on his every utterance but on the moral arc of his presidency.

Many of the people who claim to follow Jesus are instruments of a merciless leader and a merciless movement. They have chosen their political loyalties over their faith, even while using the latter to validate the former. There is something morally twisted and discrediting in this.

One of the most elevating features of Christianity is the concept—and it is not only a Christian concept—of imago Dei. It is the belief that human beings are created in the image of God and valued because we are loved by God. Every person has inherent dignity and worth. Out of that conviction should arise compassion and empathy, including a solidarity with the poor and weak and wounded. It is the way of Jesus—and the way of Jesus, and the person of Jesus, has won our hearts.

Friederich Nietzsche “thought that if a culture was clutching calcified truths, one needed to sound them out relentlessly,” the historian Jennifer Ratner-Rosenhagen has written. Nietzsche identified himself as a “philosopher with a hammer,” spending his career “tapping that hammer against Western ideals turned hollow idols.” He challenged the notion of eternal truth, of absolute morality, and of God, whom he declared dead.

But “from time to time,” Ratner-Rosenhagen wrote, “Nietzsche put down his hammer as he tried to imagine a world after moral absolutes. Even he wondered what would happen once every article of faith had been shed and every claim to universal truth exposed as a human construct.”

It is a supreme irony that so many American Christians have now picked up the hammer that Nietzsche put down, as if to finish the work he began.</div>

            <h2>Susie Wiles Gets in Trouble for Saying What Everyone Knows</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2025-12-16</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/2025/12/real-revelation-susie-wiles-interviews/685281/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">In a normal presidency, the interviews that White House Chief of Staff Susie Wiles gave to Vanity Fair would trigger her resignation, maybe even the president’s impeachment. She admitted that President Donald Trump employs prosecutorial power for “score settling,” called Budget Director Russell Vought “a right-wing absolute zealot,” described Vice President J. D. Vance as “a conspiracy theorist for a decade,” and attributed Elon Musk’s erratic style in gutting federal agencies to his “avowed ketamine” use.

Yet no one on the right is calling for anyone to resign, or even for a congressional investigation into these allegations. That is not because Wiles—who is credited with largely masterminding Trump’s victorious presidential campaign—lacks credibility, nor is it because she has denied these comments (she has accused the magazine of taking her words out of context, which is what people say when they know they were recorded). It is simply because these quotes, while dire, are also unsurprising. Wiles did not say anything that Republicans didn’t already know. Her error lay in the breach between what Trump’s supporters understand and what they are permitted to say.

To grasp the moral abnormality of this state of affairs, let’s try a thought experiment. Suppose Joe Biden’s chief of staff had told a reporter that the president at least sometimes charged his political enemies with federal crimes because he didn’t like them, and that his most influential officials were ideological zealots, conspiracy theorists, and drug users.

I can imagine two possible responses to such an interview. One is to conclude that the chief of staff had gone crazy and should be fired immediately. The other is to consider the allegations worthy of investigation in order to assess whether the president is fit to hold the powers of the presidency. What I can’t imagine concluding is that the allegations were true and that Biden could continue going on his merry way as president.

Yet this is the Republican Party’s response. The Trump administration swiftly rolled out a series of tributes attesting to Wiles’s loyalty and blaming the “fake news” media for her comments. “The radical left is at it again, trying to create discord on President Trump’s team. It won’t work because we know & love @SusieWiles,” tweeted Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy, who added: “As someone who actually works closely with Susie, I can attest that she is brilliant, tough as nails, and is 100% dedicated to President Trump & America.”

Kelly Loeffler, the head of the Small Business Administration, called Wiles “a brilliant strategist who leads the Cabinet with grace and grit, even in the face of relentless fake news.” Donald Trump Jr. wrote a long testimonial calling Wiles “by far the most effective and trustworthy Chief of Staff that my father has ever had,” neglecting to even mention the inconvenient revelations.

Jonathan Chait: The conservative movement’s intellectual collapse

Outside of the administration, Trump’s media defenders have responded by angrily castigating Wiles for opening her mouth to the media. “Genuinely sick to death of people on the right who seek the approval of left-wing media. Or even play with them for a minute. I can’t take it. It’s the saddest fetish,” complained the Federalist editor Mollie Hemingway. “You talked to them. What did you expect?” scolded National Review’s Dan McLaughlin.

These esteemed members of the conservative press appear untroubled over whether the Trump administration is in fact filled with crackpots who commit grave abuses of power. Their anger is reserved for Wiles for admitting as much to the “lamestream” media.

In this way, the most remarkable revelation from these newly published interviews comes not from what Wiles did or didn’t say, but in how Trump and his enablers are spinning it. Comments that would have precipitated a crisis in any other presidency are now simply being dismissed—knowingly, cynically—as “fake news.”</div>

The dementia reaches across party lines. The GOP is insufferable in some areas, but the question needs to be asked &quot;exactly how did they get elected?&quot; The reason is a person who was really suffering from dementia wrongly decided they could run and win the presidency a second time.

Can you imagine finishing a project and then a magical tax suddenly appearing before you get to even turn it on simply because the government of the day hates you. America is shooting itself in the foot. No one in their right mind would invest in any infrastructure there right now.

Or indeed, any time before we institute some strong controls which somehow prevent this from happening again. And good luck to us on that.

In one of the more horrific weekends in recent memory, a mass shooting rocked Rhode Island’s Brown University. It hit hard on the campus where we teach and study, Amherst College, located as it is two hours away. Brown is not exactly a sister school of Amherst, but many of the students here have friends there, as do many faculty members. And like Brown, Amherst has an open campus.

Less than 12 hours after the mass shooting at Brown, a terror attack stunned Sydney’s Bondi Beach, targeting Jews. This was another blow to us as Jews at Amherst. Between Bondi Beach and Brown, 17 are dead, and more than 40 wounded. And we are left thinking about what can be done in this country to make it possible for students and faculty not to have to look over their shoulders during classes or final examinations?

We want to be able to teach and learn without the fear that the horror of Bondi Beach or Brown will happen here or on any other campus, to Jews and not Jews alike. Despite what many are arguing in the wake of these two tragedies, reasonable gun regulations help make classrooms like ours safer.

It’s true that Rhode Island’s gun control laws already are stronger than those of most American states. Sandy Hook Promise says Rhode Island has experienced just two of the country’s over 3,000 mass shootings since 2020 and has America’s fourth-lowest firearm death rate. And Australia’s gun laws are stricter than any in this country.

Surely, we will hear that guns don’t kill, people do. If gun control is so effective, gun rights activists will ask, why did it fail twice this weekend?

That’s the wrong question. We know that even the best policies don’t work perfectly. And in the United States, people can get around the strict laws in one state by getting guns in other states. History, though, tells us that gun control works.

In the 18 years leading up to the 1996 Port Arthur massacre, Australia experienced 12 mass shootings. Then, on April 28 of that year, Martin Bryant went on a shooting spree in the Tasmanian tourist town, killing 35 and wounding another 23.

That made 18 years, marked by 13 mass shootings. The Australian government was finally ready to respond.

Less than two weeks after Port Arthur, on May 10, Australia adopted its National Firearms Agreement. The NFA has several provisions not found in any state’s gun laws in America. Australians wishing to purchase a firearm must first establish a “genuine reason” for ownership. Importantly, their reason cannot be personal protection and is instead limited to occupational use, hunting, sport shooting, or being a “bona fide collector.” If at any point a gun owner no longer has a genuine reason, their license and firearms are removed.

The NFA contains a compensatory firearm buyback program, a limit of one gun purchase per 28 days, and does not allow for private ownership of “self-loading” (semi-automatic or automatic) firearms. When the NFA was agreed to in 1996, 15.3 percent of Australian households owned guns. By 2005, this number fell to 6.2 percent.

And for two decades, the country experienced virtually no mass shootings. Still, critics of the NFA argue it’s been ineffective, saying the decline in gun-related homicides post-NFA was a continuation of an already existing trend.

While it is true that it’s difficult to definitively prove that the NFA is solely responsible for the decline in Australia’s gun-related homicide rate, it’s hard to contest the NFA’s profound effect on mass shootings.

Since January 2020, according to an Associated Press report, there have been two mass shootings in Australia. In the U.S., that number is 3,499. That means that faculty and students at Australian universities don’t have the burden of teaching and learning in fear.

But in the United States, they do. Our mass shooting problem has long been a problem on our campuses.

As the Voice of America’s report on college campus shootings notes, “The first mass shooting in modern U.S. history at a college or university took place in 1966 at the University of Texas at Austin. Fifteen people were killed and 31 others injured.” Since then, they have occurred at places like Florida State University, the University of Virginia, Virginia Tech, and Northern Arizona University.

Australia’s National Firearms Agreement works because it functions universally—not by state—demonstrating the need for a national-level solution in the United States. Why haven’t we done what Australia has done?

The usual answer is the Second Amendment and our distinctive gun culture. But even former Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, a famous supporter of gun rights, recognized that it’s still possible to regulate guns in adherence with his own extremely gun-rights friendly view of the Second Amendment.

For example, Massachusetts, where we work and study, does not currently honor the concealed carry permits of other states. To own a gun you must be at least 21, take a firearm safety course, and pass a thorough background check to obtain a “license to carry.” Everytown has found substantial increases in gun violence in states with weaker permit requirements.

Or take regulations like the Gun Control Act of 1968. Among other things, it includes licensing requirements and “prohibited persons” who cannot buy guns. In addition, the National Instant Criminal Background Check System, in place since 1998, has led to denials in over 2 million potential firearm sales. The Bipartisan Safer Communities Act of 2022 enhanced background checks and extended prohibitions on individuals convicted of certain offenses.

It is clear that avenues exist for Congress to regulate firearms. For the sake of students, teachers, and Americans everywhere, they need to use them. We need our own version of Australia’s National Firearms Agreement.

It would be a hard sell to our current pro-gun Supreme Court. But as activists have learned in other areas, what seems implausible now may someday seem like a common-sense reading of the Constitution.

We know that the 1999 shooting at Columbine High School that killed 13 and wounded 24, or the 2007 shooting at Virginia Tech that left 32 dead, 17 injured—to say nothing of Sandy Hook, 2012, 26 dead; the Pulse Nightclub, 2016, 49 dead; or in 2018 at Tree of Life Synagogue, 11 dead—didn’t spur the kind of change we are advocating. But we can’t give up.

We are afraid, and we want to do something to alleviate it. We are not the only ones.

Surveys taken last year found that 1 in 3 college students fear that an outbreak of gun violence will occur on their campus. After last weekend, it will only get worse.

If Port Arthur could be enough to spur Australia to act, why can’t a weekend in which students and faculty on college campuses, and all Americans, had to bear witness to mass murder at Bondi Beach and Brown, be enough for us?

My governor wants Americans to stop shouting “Fire!” in a crowded theater.

Generally wise advice, that. But it is hard to take him seriously when the theater is, indeed, on fire. And he has come to support one of the worst political arsonists in American history.

To be fair, Spencer Cox, the Republican governor of Utah, faces a dilemma that burdens many of his party’s leaders, especially those who were active before the rise of Donald Trump and may wish to do meaningful work after he is gone. How to behave so as to have hope that the MAGA beast you deplore might eat you last.

Cox has earned himself a lot of national media attention recently for what he calls the “Disagree Better” campaign, launched a couple of years ago with a bipartisan collective of other U.S. governors. He has appeared with Democrats including Colorado Gov. Jared Polis, New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham, and Gov. Josh Shapiro of Pennsylvania to promote the idea.

The initiative took on added significance in September when the right-wing firebrand Charlie Kirk was murdered while giving an open-air talk at Utah Valley University in Orem.

Cox was right to seize the occasion to repeat his call for Americans to reject political violence, turn down the temperature, get off social media algorithms that deliberately fry your brain, and learn to talk rather than fight. He took advantage of the increased media focus to take his message to such prominent news outlets as 60 Minutes on CBS and NPR’s Morning Edition.

“I’m not asking anybody to hold hands and hug it out,” he told CBS correspondent Scott Pelley. “I’m trying to get people to stop shooting each other.”

Sensible people can raise no argument to that. And it is difficult to watch or listen to Cox and argue that he is anything but sincere.

But the governor’s peace message is all but overwhelmed by the fact that he is a member of the political party that has thrice nominated, and twice elected, as president of the United States a man whose popularity and power exist only on rising air currents of fear, prejudice, division, and violence.

Trump is a hate vampire who would instantly dissolve in the sunlight if America suddenly became a peaceful nation practicing respectful politics.

Cox seemed to see that, saying in 2016 that he was not supporting Trump due to the obvious flaws in his character.

“I think he represents the worst of what our great country stands for,” Cox said at the time.

Cox didn’t vote for Trump in 2020 either, though he recognized the president as the head of his party. He rightly and courageously blamed Trump for the Jan. 6, 2021, assault on the Capitol and said the president should resign because of it.

Early on, Cox said he wasn’t going to vote for Trump (or Joe Biden) in 2024, either.

Then, after Trump survived an assassination attempt, Cox turned around. He sent a letter to the president, saying he believed that Trump had been spared death for a reason and calling on him to do the one thing that every sentient being should know Trump will never do: Bring peace.

Cox now risks seeming less visionary than gullible. Like Franklin Roosevelt imagining he could reason with Stalin at Yalta. (The Soviet dictator was, in FDR’s hopeful mind, “get-atable.”)

Maybe Cox decided not to mount what would likely be a futile frontal assault on Trump’s hateful pronouncements and policies and chose to start working a quieter long game.

Maybe he just wanted to be reelected governor.

As an opinion writer and editor for the Salt Lake Tribune, I’ve been following Cox’s career since 2013, when he was plucked from relative obscurity to fill a vacant spot as lieutenant governor.

He’s no newcomer to political comity, and has always seemed sincere promoting it.

In Utah, being lieutenant governor, which Cox was from 2013 to 2021, is a real job. It includes such administrative duties as running the state’s election mechanisms, which Cox took to heart by promoting voter registration—sometimes featuring himself in goofy person-on-the-street videos—and flawlessly implementing the state’s vote-by-mail process.

When his boss, Gov. Gary Herbert, didn’t run again in 2020, Cox rode his jus’ folks, alfalfa-farmer persona (he’s also a lawyer and a telecom executive who served as a small-town mayor and state legislator in a fast-rising political career) into the governor’s mansion.

That was also the beginning of his reputation as a political peacemaker.

He and his Democratic opponent that year, a law professor named Chris Peterson, ran a joint advertisement somewhat stylistically reminiscent of the Mac vs. PC spots from about 2006. In it, each candidate asked for your vote, but spent more time calling for political harmony.

“We can debate issues without degrading each other’s character,” Peterson said.

“We can disagree without hating each other,” Cox answered.

It was a YouTube sensation. #StandUnited.

Utah hasn’t elected a Democrat to statewide office since 1996, so whoever carries the GOP nomination has long been considered a shoo-in come November. Thus Cox was not risking anything by giving his underfunded Democratic rival some oxygen that he otherwise would not have had.

In 2024, the path to reelection was a little more fraught. Cox drew a right-wing, MAGA primary challenger and was denied the endorsement of the Utah State Republican Convention. But Cox gathered enough signatures on a nominating petition to still be on the ballot in the Republican primary, which he won with 55 percent of the vote.

In November, with that same MAGA opponent drawing 13.5 percent in a write-in bid, Cox won reelection with 53 percent of the vote.

Between the primary and the general, when politicians are generally expected to crabwalk from the extremes to the center, Cox shifted from a quiet Never Trump Republican to a supporter of Trump’s campaign to return to the White House. He went so far as to join Trump for a cringe-inducing—and, because it was so blatantly political, illegal—visit to Arlington National Cemetery.

As governor, Cox has held moderate to right-wing Republican positions that should have made renomination an easy matter. He signed legislation allowing Utahns to carry firearms without a permit. He favors reducing federal environmental regulations and rescinding the designation of national monuments—a big deal in a state where 64 percent of the land is federally owned.

He has backed attempts in the Legislature to gerrymander the state’s four congressional districts in favor of Republicans and signed a law banning the fluoridation of drinking water in the state.

He has flip-flopped on diversity, equity, and inclusion policies in state government and education institutions—was supportive, now opposes—and supports the state’s attempts to basically ban abortion.

Cox had also given touchingly humane voice to the idea that LGBTQ+ people deserve respect and in 2022 vetoed a bill that would have prohibited transgender youth from participating in school sports. (The veto was quickly overridden by the Republican supermajority in the Utah Legislature. And Cox has since signed other legislation seen as curtailing transgender rights.)

It drew national attention and led Time magazine to dub him “The Red-State Governor Who’s Not Afraid to Be ‘Woke.’ ”

Such sentiments, along with his opposition to Trump, earned him a round of boos when he addressed the Utah Republican State Convention in 2024. “Maybe you just hate that I don’t hate enough,” Cox told the delegates.

To all outward appearances, Spencer Cox has little hate in him. But if he won’t more forcefully call out the would-be dictator who thrives on negative emotions, the cure for all this political rancor won’t be disagreeing better. It will be a country where people aren’t allowed to disagree at all. And more violence will be assured.

            <div id="article-text">Analytics vendor Mixpanel says it is not the source of data stolen from Pornhub and says the info was last accessed by an employee of the adult site.

&quot;Mixpanel is aware of reports that Pornhub has been extorted with data that was allegedly stolen from us,&quot; a Mixpanel spokesperson told The Register. &quot;We can find no indication that this data was stolen from Mixpanel during our November 2025 security incident or otherwise.&quot;

Mixpanel&#39;s statement follows an earlier alert from Pornhub blaming the analytics provider for the security incident.

&quot;The data was last accessed by a legitimate employee account at Pornhub&#39;s parent company in 2023,&quot; the Mixpanel spokesperson continued. &quot;If this data is in the hands of an unauthorized party, we do not believe that is the result of a security incident at Mixpanel.&quot;

An Aylo spokesperson declined to answer The Register&#39;s questions about the breach. &quot;We stand by our statement,&quot; the spokesperson said, adding that it the company will share updates as additional information becomes available.

Last month, Mixpanel disclosed a &quot;smishing campaign&quot; that it detected on November 8 and that affected some OpenAI customers.

Smishing, which combines phishing and SMS messages, is a social engineering scam frequently used by ShinyHunters and its larger cybercrime collective Scattered Lapsus$ Hunters to acquire employee credentials, bypass multi-factor authentication, and gain initial access to corporate systems.

Data extortion crew ShinyHunters, when contacted by The Register, claimed responsibility for the stolen Pornhub analytics data and said it includes users&#39; search and video-watching histories. ShinyHunters would not, however, say how or when they obtained the data.

In a December 12 notice to users, Pornhub said the breach involved &quot;select Premium users&#39;&quot; data and pinned the blame on Mixpanel:

The incident occurred within our analytics vendor Mixpanel&#39;s environment and involved a limited set of analytics events for some users. This was not a breach of Pornhub Premium&#39;s systems. No passwords, credentials, payment details or government IDs were compromised or exposed. Like Google, ChatGPT and others who were compromised as a part of the same attack, Mixpanel informed us of this breach.

In a Tuesday update, however, the adult content site removed its earlier mentions of Google and ChatGPT:

We recently learned that an unauthorized party gained unauthorized access to analytics data stored with Mixpanel, a third-party data analytics service provider. The unauthorized party was able to use this unauthorized access to extract a limited set of analytics events for some users. This was not a breach of Pornhub Premium&#39;s systems. No passwords, credentials, payment details or government IDs were compromised or exposed and we have since secured the affected account and stopped the unauthorized access.

The last line about &quot;securing the affected account and stopping the unauthorized access&quot; seems to line up with Mixpanel&#39;s allegation about the stolen data being last accessed by a Pornhub parent company employee – and then either obtained by ShinyHunters via phishing or from a disgruntled employee, along the lines of what happened with CrowdStrike last month.

In November, CrowdStrike confirmed that it had fired a &quot;suspicious insider&quot; who shared screenshots of internal systems with Scattered Lapsus$ Hunters.

A source with knowledge of the Pornhub incident told The Register that &quot;the structure of the exfiltrated data is consistent with a regular data export.&quot; ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Want to hear just the guitar riff from a song? How about cutting out the train noise from a voice recording? Meta says its new SAM Audio model can separate and edit sounds using simple prompts, cutting down on the manual work typical of audio-editing tools.

The release of the Segment Anything Model (SAM) Audio follows the previous release of Meta-made segmentation models for visual assets. Meta now claims that it has created &quot;the first unified multimodal model for audio separation&quot; in SAM Audio, which is available today on the company&#39;s Segment Anything Playground as well as for download.

By &quot;multimodal,&quot; Meta is referring to SAM Audio&#39;s ability to interpret three types of prompts for audio segmentation: text prompts, time-segment markings, and visual selections in video used to isolate or remove specific sounds.

Take a video of a band playing, for example, and select the guitarist to have SAM Audio automatically isolate that player. Highlight the waveform of a barking dog in an outdoor recording, tell SAM to remove that sound, and it can trace and eliminate those interruptions throughout the entire file.

&quot;SAM Audio performs reliably across diverse, real-world scenarios — using text, visual, and temporal cues,&quot; Meta said in its SAM Audio announcement. &quot;This approach gives people precise and intuitive control over how audio is separated.&quot;

The company said it sees a number of use cases for SAM Audio, like cleaning up an audio file, removing background noise, and other tasks that previously required hands-on work in audio-editing software or dedicated sound-mixing tools.

That said, using AI to process audio isn&#39;t exactly a new idea - there are plenty of products out there that do what SAM Audio does, but Meta describes the space as a &quot;fragmented&quot; one, &quot;with a variety of tools designed for single-purpose use cases,&quot; unlike SAM Audio&#39;s so-called unified model.

Given its ability to isolate specific sounds based on user prompts, questions may naturally arise about the safety of such a model and whether it could be used to single out voices or conversations in public recordings, potentially creating a new avenue for snooping. We picked through Meta&#39;s SAM Audio page and an associated research paper to get more information on safety features built into the new model, but the company didn&#39;t cover that at all.

When asked about safety, Meta only told us that if it&#39;s illegal without AI, you shouldn&#39;t use AI to do it.

&quot;As the SAM license notes, use of the SAM Materials must comply with applicable laws and regulations, including Trade Control Laws and applicable privacy and data protection laws,&quot; a Meta spokesperson told The Register, making it sound suspiciously like using SAM Audio for evil would be perfectly within its capabilities.

Then again, it&#39;s possible Meta&#39;s own admission that SAM Audio has &quot;some limitations&quot; may mean that it&#39;s not exactly ready for those who want to use AI to reenact a modern version of The Conversation. It&#39;s still &quot;a challenge&quot; for SAM Audio to separate out &quot;highly similar audio events,&quot; like picking out one voice among many or isolating a single instrument from an orchestra, Meta noted. SAM Audio also can&#39;t complete any audio separation without a prompt, and can&#39;t take audio as a prompt either, meaning feeding it a sound you want it to isolate is still outside of the scope of the bot.

One area that SAM Audio could be useful for is in the accessibility space, which Meta said it&#39;s actively working toward. The company said it&#39;s partnered with US hearing aid manufacturer Starkey to look at potential integrations, as well as working with 2gether-International, an accelerator for disabled startup founders, to explore more accessibility possibilities that SAM Audio could serve. ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Ad blockers and VPNs are supposed to protect your privacy, but four popular browser extensions have been doing just the opposite. According to research from Koi Security, these pernicious plug-ins have been harvesting the text of chatbot conversations from more than 8 million people and sending them back to the developers.

The four seemingly helpful extensions are Urban VPN Proxy, 1ClickVPN Proxy, Urban Browser Guard, and Urban Ad Blocker. They&#39;re distributed via the Chrome Web Store and Microsoft Edge Add-ons, but include code designed to capture and transmit browser-based interactions with popular AI tools.

&quot;Urban VPN Proxy targets conversations across ten AI platforms,&quot; said Idan Dardikman, co-founder and CTO of Koi, in a blog post published Monday.

The research firm said that the platforms targeted include ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, Microsoft Copilot, Perplexity, DeepSeek, Grok, and Meta AI.

&quot;For each platform, the extension includes a dedicated &#39;executor&#39; script designed to intercept and capture conversations,&quot; said Dardikman, who explained data harvesting is enabled by default through a hardcoded configuration flag. &quot;There is no user-facing toggle to disable this. The only way to stop the data collection is to uninstall the extension entirely.&quot;

According to Dardikman, the Urban VPN Proxy extension monitors the user&#39;s browser tabs and, when the user visits one of the targeted platforms (e.g., chatgpt.com), it injects the &quot;executor&quot; script into the page.

&quot;Once injected, the script overrides fetch() and XMLHttpRequest – the fundamental browser APIs that handle all network requests,&quot; he explained. &quot;This is an aggressive technique. The script wraps the original functions so that every network request and response on that page passes through the extension&#39;s code first.&quot;

The script parses the intercepted API responses and then packages and transmits the data via window.postMessage to the extension&#39;s content script, along with the identifier PANELOS_MESSAGE. The content script then passes the data to a background service worker for exfiltration over the network to endpoints at analytics.urban-vpn.com and stats.urban-vpn.com.

The Register reached out to Urban VPN, affiliated company BiScience, and 1ClickVPN at their respective privacy email addresses. All three requests bounced.

Pointing to prior investigative material published by security researcher Wladimir Palant and John Tuckner of Secure Annex that details BiScience&#39;s collection of clickstream/browsing history data, Dardikman said his company&#39;s findings show BiScience expanding into the collection of AI conversations.

He notes that while Urban VPN does disclose AI data collection during the setup prompt and in its privacy policy, the Chrome Web Store listing indicates that data is not being sold to third parties outside approved use cases and that AI conversations are not specifically mentioned.

&quot;The consent prompt frames AI monitoring as protective,&quot; he said. &quot;The privacy policy reveals the data is sold for marketing.&quot; He adds that users who installed Urban VPN prior to July 2025 would have never seen the consent prompt, which was added via a silent update with version 5.5.0.

He also argues that the software provides no indication that data collection happens even when the VPN is not active.

Dardikman notes that Urban VPN received a Featured Badge from the Chrome Web Store team.

&quot;This means a human at Google reviewed Urban VPN Proxy and concluded it met their standards,&quot; he said. &quot;Either the review didn&#39;t examine the code that harvests conversations from Google&#39;s own AI product (Gemini), or it did and didn&#39;t consider this a problem.&quot;

He observes that the Chrome Web Store policies explicitly prohibit transferring or selling user data to third party data brokers like BiScience.

Google did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The problem appears to be a loophole in Google&#39;s Chrome Web Store Limited Use policy, which allows data to be transferred to third parties for limited scenarios (e.g., security or business ownership change) that do not include transferring data to data brokers.

Palant in his post suggests that BiScience and its affiliated partners implement user-facing features that allegedly require access to browsing history, to claim the &quot;necessary to providing or improving your single purpose&quot; exception that allows limited data transfer to third parties. Or they claim the security exception by implementing safe browsing or ad blocking features.

&quot;Chrome Web Store appears to interpret their policies as allowing the transfer of user data, if extensions claim Limited Use exceptions through their privacy policy or other user disclosures,&quot; Palant wrote. &quot;Unfortunately, bad actors falsely claim these exceptions to sell user data to third parties.&quot;

&quot;If you have any of these extensions installed, uninstall them now,&quot; Dardikman concluded. &quot;Assume any AI conversations you&#39;ve had since July 2025 have been captured and shared with third parties.&quot; ®

Any ebook reader will let you cram a Beauty and the Beast-sized library’s worth of books in your pocket, but so will your phone. An ebook reader offers a more book-like reading experience, with fewer distractions and less eye strain, and many include extra features, like adjustable frontlighting. Some really are pocketable. Others are waterproof or offer physical page-turning buttons, while a few even let you take notes.

I’ve been using ebook readers for nearly a decade, and I’ve gone hands-on with dozens, from the Kindle Paperwhite to lesser-known rivals like the PocketBook Era. Whether you want something your kid can throw against the wall or a waterproof, warm-glow Kindle that won’t ruin your spa ambiance, these are the best ebook readers for everyone.

When testing a new ebook reader, I make sure to use it as my primary device for at least a full week. For those seven days, if not longer, that e-reader is my principal way of consuming ebooks, audiobooks, and most articles from the web (if applicable). If the device has note-taking capabilities, I’ll use it to annotate books and jot down various reminders, to-do lists, and notes. I’ll even use it for some light journaling, as well as doodling.On average, I tend to read for about an hour a day — longer on weekends — either for work or to unwind at the beach, in bed, or in the bathtub. I buy books directly from each e-reader’s respective bookstore, borrow library books via Overdrive, and try to sideload various file formats to see how easy it is to do.

How easy is it to use and read on? A sharp display and relatively fast performance are essential to an enjoyable reading experience, as are size and weight.

Some e-readers come with different features, like waterproofing, which means you really can read anywhere. Others offer buttons that make using the e-reader more intuitive to use.

There must be easy, direct access to a wide selection of digital titles, including audiobooks and various file formats.

Is the price justified, given what the e-reader offers?

Dimensions: 7 x 5 x .3 inches / Weight: 211 grams / Screen area and resolution: 7-inch screen, 300ppi resolution / Storage: 16GB / Other features: IPX8 waterproofing, Bluetooth audio support

If you mostly buy ebooks from Amazon, you’ll want a Kindle, and the 12th-gen Kindle Paperwhite is the best choice for most people. Starting at $159.99, it’s cheaper than the Kobo Libra Colour — my top non-Amazon ebook reader, which I’ll dive into later — while offering many of the same features. Those include a spacious 7-inch 300pi display with rich contrast levels and an adjustable warm white frontlight, which make for a clear and enjoyable reading experience. The latter also conveniently improves sleep by cutting down on blue light that interrupts melatonin production.

That warm white frontlighting is an advantage over the cool white of the $109.99 base-model Kindle, and unlike the base Kindle, the Paperwhite has IPX8 water resistance. The $199.99 Signature Edition Paperwhite also has an auto-adjusting frontlight and no lockscreen ads. It has wireless charging, which is a rare feature to find in an e-reader.

Amazon dominates the US ebook market, so Kindle owners have access to advantages owners of other ebook readers don’t. Much of Amazon’s hardware strategy depends on offering cut-rate discounts to pull you into its content ecosystem. If you have Prime and buy a lot of Kindle ebooks, the Paperwhite is the best choice because its ebooks and audiobooks are often on sale at Amazon, and Prime members get more free content through Prime Reading. Rivals like Kobo offer sales, too, but it’s hard for them to offer discounts as steep as Amazon.

There are downsides, though. The Paperwhite has lockscreen ads unless you pay $20 extra to get rid of them. It’s also too big to hold comfortably with one hand. Perhaps the Kindle Paperwhite’s biggest flaw, though — which it shares with all Kindles aside from Fire tablets — is that it’s not easy to read books purchased outside of Amazon’s store. Kindle ebook formats are proprietary and only work on Kindle. Unlike Kobo and other ebook readers, Kindles don’t support EPUB files, an open file format used by pretty much everyone except Amazon. So, for example, if you often shop from Kobo’s bookstore (or Barnes & Noble or Google Play Books or many other ebook stores), you can’t easily read those books on a Kindle without using a workaround. There are ways to convert and transfer file formats so you can read on the Kindle and vice versa, but it’ll take a couple of extra steps.

However, if you don’t buy your books elsewhere or you don’t mind shopping from Amazon, you’ll be more than happy with the Kindle Paperwhite.

Dimensions: 5.69 x 6.34 x 0.33 inches / Weight: 199.5 grams / Screen area and resolution: 7-inch screen, 300ppi (black-and-white), 150ppi (color) / Storage: 32GB / Other features: Physical page-turning buttons, waterproofing, Kobo Stylus 2 support, Bluetooth audio support

The Kobo Libra Colour is an excellent alternative to Amazon’s ebook readers, especially for readers outside the US or anyone who doesn’t want to tap into Amazon’s ecosystem. Kobo’s latest slate offers many of the standout features found on the 12th-gen Kindle Paperwhite — including waterproofing, USB-C support, and a 300ppi display — along with a few perks that make it more helpful and enjoyable to use.

The color display is the most obvious. The Libra Colour uses E Ink’s latest Kaledio color screen technology, which provides soothing, pastel-like hues that still pop in direct sunlight. It’s not as sharp as reading in monochrome — the resolution drops to 150ppi when viewing content in color — but it’s a nice touch that makes viewing a wider range of content more pleasant. Book covers and comics, while still muted, have an added layer of depth, even if the colors are nowhere near as vivid as that of a traditional LED tablet or as vibrant as the Kindle Colorsoft Signature Edition.

However, unlike the Kindle Colorsoft Signature Edition, the Libra Colour works with a digital pen — the Kobo Stylus 2 (sold separately) — which lets you highlight text in various colors or take notes using Kobo’s integrated notebooks. You can also take advantage of some of the more advanced capabilities found in the Kobo Elipsa 2E, allowing you to solve math equations, convert handwriting into typed text, and insert diagrams. This lets the Libra Colour function as a mini notebook of sorts, though I wouldn’t use it as a primary note-taking device since the seven-inch display can feel cramped to write on.

The color display is only part of the appeal, though. The Libra Colour doesn’t have the lockscreen ads on the base Paperwhite — and packs physical page-turning buttons, which feel more intuitive to use than tapping either side of the display as you have to do on Amazon’s modern e-readers. The speedy e-reader also supports more file formats, including EPUB files, and makes it much easier to borrow books from the Overdrive library system. Until recently, Kobo offered support for the bookmarking app Pocket, which was another big selling point as it let you read saved articles offline. While the app is no longer available, Kobo recently replaced Pocket with Instapaper, which you can download in a free update.

However, at $229.99, the Libra Colour costs $70 more than the entry-level Paperwhite — and that’s without Kobo’s $69.99 stylus, which is required for performing certain tasks. That gap widens further when the Paperwhite is on sale, which happens more often than the Libra Colour. The Kobo can’t easily tap into Amazon’s vast library of ebooks, which can be frustrating if you’ve amassed a collection of Kindle titles over the years. It can be done, but you have to convert file formats using third-party apps, which is tricky and can take time.

But if those things don’t matter or apply to you, the Kobo Libra Colour will give you the best digital reading experience of all the e-readers on our list. It’s my personal favorite.

Excellent, high-resolution displayEasy to hold with one handFaster than its predecessor with improved battery lifeFun color options

No waterproofingLacks adjustable color temperatureSlightly more expensive than its predecessor

Dimensions: 6.2 x 4.3 x 0.32 inches / Weight: 158 grams / Screen area and resolution: 6-inch screen, 300ppi resolution / Storage: 16GB / Other features: USB-C support, Bluetooth audio support

The base-model Kindle ($109.99 with ads) is the best cheap ebook reader. Its 300ppi resolution makes text clearer and easier to read than the lower-resolution screens on other ebook readers in its price range. Plus, it has USB-C for relatively fast charging.

Reading on its six-inch screen feels a little more cramped than it does on the larger displays of the Kindle Paperwhite and Kobo Libra Colour. However, the flip side is that its small size makes it pocketable, light, and easy for small hands to hold. Combined with its relatively affordable price, the Kindle is also the best ebook reader for kids — especially the Amazon Kindle Kids Edition which costs $20 more. The kid-friendly version shares the same specs but is ad-free with parental controls, a two-year extended replacement guarantee, and a case. It also comes with six months of Amazon Kids Plus, which grants kids access to thousands of children’s books and audiobooks for free. After that, though, you’ll have to $79 per year (or $48 with Amazon Prime).

The base Kindle doesn’t have extra conveniences like the waterproofing you’ll find in the entry-level Kobo Clara BW and Paperwhite. You also don’t get the physical page-turning buttons found on Barnes & Noble’s entry-level e-reader, the Nook GlowLight 4e (though the Kindle is a lot snappier than the Nook). And because it’s an Amazon ebook reader, you’re also locked into the Amazon ecosystem and have to pay extra to remove ads. But if you can do without that, the Kindle delivers the essentials for under $110.

Intuitive note-taking featuresGreat e-readerAdjustable warm lightUseful note-taking capabilities, including handwriting-to-text conversion

Lacks native support for Kindle books227ppi display isn’t as sharp as the competitionNo note-summarization features

Dimensions: 7.6 x 8.94 x 0.30 inches / Weight: 390 grams / Screen area and resolution: 10.3-inches, 227ppi resolution / Storage: 32GB / Other features: Handwriting to text conversion, magnetic stylus, Bluetooth audio support

Of all the large ebook readers I tested, the Kobo Elipsa 2E stood out the most because it’s a good e-reader with solid note-taking abilities. You can write directly on pages just as on a physical book. The Kindle Scribe lets you annotate book pages as well, but it’s complicated involving resizable text boxes that mess up the page formatting and prevent you from doing basic things like circling words. In contrast, taking notes on the Elipsa 2E feels far more intuitive and natural.

The Elipsa 2E offers other helpful note-taking tools and capabilities. Like the Kobo Libra Colour, it’s capable, for example, of solving math equations for you. You can also insert diagrams and drawings, and it’ll automatically snap them into something that looks cleaner and nicer. You can also sync your notes with Dropbox or view them online and convert handwriting to typed text. The Kindle Scribe offers the latter capability, too, but again, Kobo does it faster and better within the original notebook document as opposed to on a separate page. The only thing missing from the Elipsa 2E is the Scribe’s note-summarization feature, but that’s a trade-off I am okay with given how much easier it is to take notes.

Finally, the Kobo Elipsa 2E comes with twice the storage (32GB) for the same price as the base Kindle Scribe. You can step up to the 32GB Kindle Scribe for $20 more or upgrade to 64GB for $40 extra. Yet given the Scribe’s limitations, I still recommend saving the money and buying the Kobo Elipsa 2E instead.

Note-taking capabilities aside, the Kobo Elipsa 2E is also a good e-reader with the same strengths and weaknesses as other Kobo devices. There’s support for a wide range of file formats, but you can’t easily read Kindle books without converting them first. Its 227ppi display is also slightly less sharp than the 300ppi screen found on the Kindle Scribe and the Kobo Libra Colour. However, the 10.3-inch screen balances things out a bit and makes text easier to read, so it’s not a noticeable drawback. Plus, the Elipsa 2E comes with an adjustable warm light for nighttime reading. That’s a feature rival e-readers with more advanced note-taking capabilities — including the $409.99 Onyx Boox Go 10.3, which lets you insert links to notes — lacks.

There are some other ebook readers my colleagues and I have tested that I didn’t feature above, but are still worth highlighting. Here are the most notable:

The Kindle Colorsoft Signature Edition is the first Kindle to feature E Ink’s color screen technology and it stands out from other color e-paper devices with customizations. It offers improved contrast, more vibrant colors, and faster screen refreshes. With a $279.99 price tag, it’s the most expensive Kindle model currently available that doesn’t support a stylus for note-taking, and it includes premium features like wireless charging that are convenient but not really necessary for a device with months of battery life. If you want a color screen and want to stick with Amazon, the Colorsoft Signature is your best option. - Andrew Liszewski, Senior Reporter

Amazon recently introduced a more affordable alternative to the $279.99 Kindle Colorsoft Signature Edition above called the Kindle Colorsoft. It’s $30 cheaper and delivers a nearly identical reading experience. As expected, Amazon excluded some features to hit the lower price point. Let’s run through them. There’s no wireless charging, which I can live without. Storage is halved to 16GB, which is enough for me as I primarily read ebooks. But if you’re buying a color e-reader, chances are high that you’ll want excess storage space for graphic novels, and 16GB may not cut it.

The biggest drawback for me, as a bedtime bookworm, is the lack of an auto-adjusting front light that can make nighttime reading much easier (however, its brightness and color temperature can be manually adjusted). At this price, I expect it, especially since Kobo’s $159.99 Clara Color includes one. And, given that the Colorsoft Signature Edition costs just $30 more, complete with a front light that adjusts when the room gets dim, 32GB of storage, and wireless charging, I’d opt for that instead if you’re in Amazon’s ecosystem. Unless the standard Colorsoft goes on sale for less, it’s not a great value at its regular price.

If you’re looking for a non-Amazon alternative that’s more affordable than the Kobo Libra Colour, the Kobo Clara Colour — the successor to the Kobo Clara 2E — is worth a look. At $159.99, the ad-free e-reader costs more than the Kobo Clara 2E, but I think it’s worth the extra $10. It continues to offer the same six-inch display and IPX8 waterproof design, but the e-reader now offers color. It’s also noticeably faster — something I was happy to see, considering the occasional lag on the Clara 2E sometimes got on my nerves. You don’t get the Clara Colour’s physical buttons or stylus support, but that’s a fair tradeoff at this price point. The company recently announced a white version with a slightly larger 1,900mAh battery compared to the black model’s 1,500mAh (notably, without a price increase), which Kobo says can last over a month on a single charge.

In 2023, Barnes and Noble released the Nook Glowlight 4 Plus. If you own a lot of digital books from Barnes and Noble, this could be a good Kindle alternative. Otherwise, I’d still recommend the Kobo Libra Colour to everybody else. The $199.99 Nook Glowlight 4 Plus is a good e-reader with a lot to offer, including a lovely 300ppi screen, waterproofing, physical page-turning buttons, and even a headphone jack. However, it’s just not as snappy, which makes setting it up, buying books from the device itself, and navigating the interface a slow ordeal. It didn’t help that the screen sometimes froze, too, which meant I had to restart the device while in the middle of a book.

Despite all the advantages of E Ink display technology, your smartphone is probably still a more convenient device for reading given how pocket-friendly it is. The Boox Palma 2 is a smartphone-sized E Ink device that’s just as easy to slip into a pocket, but with more capabilities than an e-reader. Its 6.3-inch E Ink display is great for reading books, but the $315.98 Palma 2 also runs Android 13 so you can install productivity apps like email and messaging — assuming you’ve got access to Wi-Fi, of course, because the compact e-reader lacks cellular connectivity. If you already have the original Palma, the sequel isn’t worth the upgrade. But if you’re looking for a smaller alternative to Kindles and Kobos, the Palma 2 could be worth the splurge. - Andrew Liszewski, Senior Reporter

The $409.99 Onyx Boox Go 10.3 is another ad-free ebook reader you can use to take notes. It’s excellent as a note-taking device, and it offers an impressively wide range of writing tools and more prebuilt notebook templates than Kobo’s Elipsa 2E. Jotting down notes using the built-in notebook felt more akin to writing on paper as well, and its slim design makes the device feel more like a traditional notebook. Like all Boox devices, it also provides quick access to the Google Play Store, so you can download multiple reading apps — including both Kindle and Kobo apps. The slate’s crisp 300ppi display is sharper than that of the Kobo Elipsa 2E, too, which is a plus.

However, in comparison to the easy-to-use Elipsa 2E, the Go 10.3 lacks a front light and comes with a steeper learning curve. Notes you take on a Kindle or Kobo device won’t transfer over (and vice versa), and you can’t annotate books in either app using the Boox. I also felt like access to Google Play can be a double-edged sword as it grants easy access to distracting apps, including games, streaming services, and TikTok. It’s too slow to use the latter, but it’s fast and comfortable enough that I found myself playing around with the Word Search app far too often. For me personally, I need my e-reader to be devoid of such distractions — it’s one of the biggest things that distinguishes it from a tablet, after all. But if you’ve got more self-control than I do, the Go 10.3 could be worth a look.

In April, Boox introduced the Go Color 7 Gen II, which retails for $249.99. This water-resistant e-reader offers a 300ppi display that drops to 150ppi when displaying color content, much like its Kobo and Kindle rivals. However, similar to the Kobo Libra Colour, this ad-free model offers physical-page turning buttons and supports note-taking. A stylus isn’t included, so you’ll need to spend an extra $45.99 for Boox’s pressure-sensitive InkSense pen if you want to take notes. And, like other Boox devices, it runs on Android, giving you access to a wide range of apps and online bookstores through the Google Play Store.

While I appreciated not having to sideload my Kindle and Kobo library, along with greater flexibility to fine-tune color settings, I ultimately prefer the Kobo Libra Colour. In my testing, the Go Color 7 Gen II felt frustratingly sluggish by comparison to the Libra Colour, which is disappointing given the Boox costs $50 more. Responsiveness is a core part of the reading experience for me, so I’d only recommend Boox’s model to readers who value having Android app flexibility over performance.

The $629.99 Kindle Scribe Colorsoft is Amazon’s first color e-reader that’s also designed for note-taking. I’ve yet to test it, but in Victoria Song’s review, she praised its thin, lightweight design, long battery life, and minimal ghosting effect. However, she thought the 11-inch display feels too large for reading or note-taking, and that the muted E Ink colors limit the appeal for artists who want to draw things beyond basic doodles. It’s also a shame that many of its best annotation features — including in-line writing and the AI-powered summarization and search tools — don’t extend to other document types, such as PDFs.

Update, December 16th: Adjusted pricing / availability, added new details regarding the Kindle Scribe Colorsoft, and removed the Boox Palma 2 Pro. Andrew Liszewski also contributed to this post.

            <div id="article-text">﻿An analysis of social media posts following Swift’s album release found “inauthentic” activity online. The Taylor Swift media ecosystem is divided over what it means.

﻿An analysis of social media posts following Swift’s album release found “inauthentic” activity online. The Taylor Swift media ecosystem is divided over what it means.

On December 9th, Rolling Stone published a story that some saw as a bombshell: a network of coordinated, “inauthentic” social media accounts had a hand in the weekslong discourse that trailed the release of Taylor Swift’s recent album, The Life of a Showgirl.

It was a big deal for those in the Swiftie/anti-Swiftie universe. Immediately following the record’s release in October, discussion of Showgirl was fan- and critic-driven — passionate but fairly calm. Listeners debated the meaning of songs, analyzed the flood of material for hidden meanings, and questioned whether the music was even good. Some fans took issue with specific lyrics, especially around Swift’s use of slang or metaphors. But at some point the discussion took a turn, and soon the tenor on social media was about whether Swift was hiding Nazi imagery into her output, or whether she was secretly MAGA. (The musician endorsed Kamala Harris for president in 2024.) Soon enough in corners of the internet, the album release was consumed by fights over whether Swift was signaling a hard right-wing pivot.

On its surface, the conversations might seem like standard fandom and anti-fandom, prompted by a much-hyped album from an artist that a lot of people have big feelings about. But the cycle of trending discourse snowballing into wall-to-wall social media activity is more than a fan rabbit hole: it’s an example of how uneven incentives turbocharge the sludge in our contemporary media ecosystem.

Two months later, new research by a little-known social listening firm seemed to upend what the public knew about how that viral discourse spread. Rolling Stone reported on research compiled by a company called Gudea, which promises clients “early visibility into rising narratives” on social media platforms. Gudea had analyzed 24,679 posts from 18,213 users on 14 different online platforms as they discussed Swift in the days following the album release. According to the report, “inauthentic” narratives that started on fringe platforms like 4chan eventually jumped to other more mainstream platforms like X and TikTok, where real people began debating whether Swift was pushing Nazi symbols and comparing Swift with Kanye West.

“This demonstrates how a strategically seeded falsehood can convert into widespread authentic discourse, reshaping public perception even when most users do not believe the originating claim,” the report reads. For some Swift fans, it was incontrovertible proof that negative discourse was the work of bots and agents of chaos. They took a victory lap.

But now Gudea’s report and Rolling Stone’s coverage has triggered a second wave of arguments that have at times spiraled into a new and ever-expanding web of theories: about Swift and her covert PR moves, Gudea and Rolling Stone, and the very act of posting online.

“No, you goofballs — Taylor Swift is not the hapless victim of a bot campaign,” one TikTok with 418,000 views begins. “You just don’t have any media literacy and you got bamboozled.”

On the other end of the spectrum, a separate TikTok user shared a video that amounted to “I told you so,” defending Swift and sharing the Rolling Stone piece. “So many opportunities to be smug this year,” the caption read. “I am taking all of them.”

And it all started with a bare-bones report that threw gasoline on a perpetual fire.

Gudea is part social listening, part public relations firm: “By translating complex online activity into clear, decision-ready intelligence, GUDEA helps communicators act sooner, proactively manage risk, and respond with confidence,” the company website reads. The startup has been around since 2023, but when the report was published, the company website was sparse. It’s the only report of its kind on the site, and there’s little information about Gudea’s personnel or previous clients. That led to accusations by Swift critics that Gudea was spun up and hired specifically to publish a report that was sympathetic to the pop star — perhaps even colluding with Swift and Rolling Stone to launder her image via the press. Some claimed Gudea was an “AI company” deploying generative AI to discredit legitimate critiques of The Life of a Showgirl. And perhaps most offensively: that the report was taking criticism coming from real people and writing it off as bot behavior.

There was plenty of organic criticism of the album and Swift’s persona more generally, particularly around lyrics and symbolism that some listeners — especially Black women — called out as racist. It follows yearslong commentary about Swift’s role in pop culture and politics as a rich, powerful white woman who is able to bend national conversations to her will and grab and retain attention on her personal projects, but only when she wants to. Some people took the Gudea report to be saying that these real, human-driven frustrations were, essentially, not real.

“Fuck you @rollingstone for saying that the outrage against Taylor Swift was “bot manufactured” when the ourtage came from Black Women. Actual. Human. Beings,” a post on Threads reads. “Are you teaming up with American Eagle? … Because the racism is LOUD.”

Miles Klee, the Rolling Stone reporter who covered Gudea’s findings, told The Verge that the outlet did not commission the report and that Swift is not a Gudea client.

“Contrary to some readings of the article, it does not suggest that every account alleging that Swift supports Trump or harbors white supremacist views was part of an influence network,” Klee wrote in an email. “Certainly, there were and are many people making those claims in earnest. But a significant amount of this content has come from a small subset of coordinated accounts that don’t behave like typical social media users. The public should understand that when they see extreme rhetoric online, it may originate from bad actors looking to manipulate the conversation.”

Jessica Maddox, an associate professor at the University of Georgia who studies social media, says that the conversation following the album release had all the hallmarks of inauthentic activity that she teaches her students to look for.

“It’s a beautiful, sunny day, and then all of a sudden … out of the blue, here comes the afternoon thunderstorm. It’s a bad one, there’s wind, there’s rain, there’s lightning, thunder, and then almost as fast as it came on, it’s gone,” Maddox says. “It has dissipated and it’s back to being a sunny day. Bot activity is kind of like that.”

Inauthentic engagement is intense, short-lived, and includes repeated refrains or sayings that recur across posts and users. Maddox — who intentionally discloses that she is a fan of Swift — also found it curious that the flavor of discourse was similar across multiple platforms. Typically when content jumps platforms there’s a sense of judgement or ridicule, she says: X users laughing about the weird thing TikTok users are doing, for example.

“I saw more of what felt like copy-and-paste topics and refrains and ideas being moved around almost too neatly compared to how discourse normally functions online,” Maddox told The Verge.

The Gudea report tracks how narratives emerged and proliferated over the course of several weeks and found that the 3.77 percent of users displaying nontypical behavior drove more than a quarter of the volume of discussion on platforms. (Gudea defines inauthentic accounts as those that “operate in ways that distort the online conversation,” like having automated posting patterns, repeating identical messages at scale, or coordinating with networks of other accounts.) Gudea also mapped and clustered different narratives that were circulating, and found that three topics were amplified by “nontypical” accounts: Nazi symbolism and conspiracies, allegations that Swift is MAGA, and the politicization of Swift’s relationship with NFL player Travis Kelce.

But lost in much of the discourse — and coverage — around the report is that Gudea acknowledges the vast majority of people were acting like typical users and that much of the discourse was “stable and free from inorganic influence.” Gudea found that discussion around cultural appropriation and Swift’s use of African American Vernacular English (AAVE) was authentic, as were general critiques of the album quality and meta commentary around Swift’s wealth and ethics. Gudea says the clearest example of inauthentic actors sowing the seeds of discourse came when accusations that Swift was using Nazi imagery successfully prompted real people to compare her to Kanye West.

“Typical users flood in, not to support the conspiracy, but to contextualize it, criticize it, or draw comparisons to Kanye West,” the report reads. “This surge ironically strengthens the narrative’s visibility by increasing conversation volume and engagement velocity.” Gudea says the narrative began on 4chan and subsequently moved through Discord, Reddit, Bluesky, and X.

“If you don’t go past the headline, it is easy and completely valid and fair to feel like, wait a minute, I am a human. I did feel these things. Why am I almost being gaslit by a company?” Maddox says. “You are being called essentially a liar and inauthentic and not human, which in this age of AI, I can’t think of anything more insulting.”

Gudea acknowledges the vast majority of people were acting like typical users

The report’s findings are fairly narrow — but once the top-line findings came down, it was disseminated, decontextualized, and reshared for maximum attention. Like many intense fan and anti-fan communities, nuance is lost as the news ripples outward and new theories and repeated falsehoods take hold. Keith Presley, cofounder and CEO of Gudea, told The Verge in an email that the report was produced independently and that the company was not asked by any outside party to put it together. Presley said Gudea contacted “counsel believed to represent Taylor Swift using publicly available legal contact information” after the report was completed; Gudea didn’t hear back.

“Gudea does not serve as an arbiter of truth. Our objective is to illuminate the underlying structure of how content is repurposed and disseminated in a coordinated manner to influence broader discourse,” Presley said in an email. “Whether a narrative is true or false is not the analytical focus; rather, we examine how actors generate polarization, segment audiences into opposing camps, and manipulate platform algorithms to achieve strategic or harmful outcomes.”

Swift’s publicist Tree Paine did not respond after The Verge said her request to be “Off the record but on background only and not to be quoted,” violates our long-standing background policy for communications professionals.

The report was provided exclusively to Rolling Stone, Presley says, because it aligned with the writer’s beat — a typical arrangement for a small firm hoping to generate media coverage for its services. Presley also clarified that the company uses generative AI only at the final interpretive stage of reports; deep learning models are used to identify patterns from large amounts of data collected from hundreds of platforms. Presley says that instead of using simple keyword searches to collect posts, Gudea uses “entity-based monitoring and platform-wide ingestion” across hundreds of sources to pull content referencing Swift, her album, and associated narratives. The posts were then grouped based on the theme of the discussion.

But the report itself has issues, Maddox points out. There is no detailed methodology, for one; very few details about how the sample size was collected; and not much information on what statistical tests were conducted. There is no breakdown of posts and users — how many came from 4chan versus X, for example, or sample posts. There are no research questions listed that Gudea sought to investigate, with the company instead telling Rolling Stone that the report was prompted by a “gut feeling” from someone on staff. The report, and by extension the news coverage of it, was thin on details and demonstrable evidence. The Rolling Stone piece also clearly hit a nerve with how it characterized the backlash to the album, describing accusations of racism or fascism as “ridiculous” and “bizarre” and perhaps putting too much stock in a surface level analysis.

“The speed at which we tackle viral events is actually pretty horrific and unsustainable.”

If Taylor Swift was actually involved, Maddox jokes, she would have done a better job. The report is neither a slam dunk for Swift superfans nor a smear campaign against real, human critics — it is somewhere in between, pointing to important findings that were communicated sloppily. It requires nuance, qualifications, and further investigation; in other words, the opposite of the immediacy and virality we chase online.

“The speed at which we tackle viral events is actually pretty horrific and unsustainable, I think for our mental health and for our just general sense of being in a culture,” Maddox says. Social platforms have incentivized scale and speed over anything else, and content creators and influencers respond to that: They swarm conversations as they emerge in real time, flocking to wherever the action is and then leaving the topic behind when there’s something new to talk about. Bad information gets passed around like a game of telephone, distorting and watering down the original reporting. A user might make 10 videos about Taylor Swift one day and then move on the next day when reach has flatlined. In other words, we all start to act a bit like bots.

            <div id="article-text">Swen Vincke is clarifying AI use at Larian following a recent interview.

Swen Vincke is clarifying AI use at Larian following a recent interview.

The CEO of Baldur’s Gate 3 studio Larian has inadvertently stirred up some controversy over the use of AI in the developer’s next game. Based on an interview with Larian CEO Swen Vincke, Bloomberg reported that the studio uses AI tools for things like developing concept art and writing placeholder text. But following some initial backlash, Vincke later clarified to IGN that the studio is “neither releasing a game with any AI components, nor are we looking at trimming down teams to replace them with AI” and published his own statement on X.

Larian announced Divinity last week at The Game Awards with a “cinematic” teaser trailer that didn’t reveal much about the game itself. Here’s what Bloomberg reported about Larian’s use of AI in Divinity:

Under Vincke, Larian has been pushing hard on generative AI, although the CEO says the technology hasn’t led to big gains in efficiency. He says there won’t be any AI-generated content in Divinity — “everything is human actors; we’re writing everything ourselves” — but the creators often use AI tools to explore ideas, flesh out PowerPoint presentations, develop concept art and write placeholder text.

The use of generative AI has led to some pushback at Larian, “but I think at this point everyone at the company is more or less OK with the way we’re using it,” Vincke said.

Vincke’s AI comments have received some pushback, including former Larian employee Selena Tobin saying on Bluesky “consider my feedback: i loved working at @larianstudios.com until AI.” A few hours after Bloomberg’s report, IGN published the following statement from Vincke, which Larian has also shared with The Verge:

We’ve been continuously increasing our pool of concept artists , writers and story-tellers, are actively putting together writer rooms, casting and recording performances from actors and hiring translators.

Since concept art is being called out explicitly - we have 23 concept artists and have job openings for more. These artists are creating concept art day in day out for ideation and production use.

Everything we do is incremental and aimed at having people spend more time creating.

Any ML tool used well is additive to a creative team or individual’s workflow, not a replacement for their skill or craft.

We are researching and understanding the cutting edge of ML as a toolset for creatives to use and see how it can make their day-to-day lives easier, which will let us make better games.

We are neither releasing a game with any AI components, nor are we looking at trimming down teams to replace them with AI.

While I understand it’s a subject that invokes a lot of emotion, it’s something we are constantly discussing internally through the lens of making everyone’s working day better, not worse.

Holy fuck guys we’re not “pushing hard” for or replacing concept artists with AI.

We have a team of 72 artists of which 23 are concept artists and we are hiring more. The art they create is original and I’m very proud of what they do.

I was asked explicitly about concept art and our use of Gen AI. I answered that we use it to explore things. I didn’t say we use it to develop concept art. The artists do that. And they are indeed world class artists.

We use AI tools to explore references, just like we use google and art books. At the very early ideation stages we use it as a rough outline for composition which we replace with original concept art. There is no comparison.

I talked about how we use ML here if you would like to know more: https://gamespot.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-dev-embraces-machine-learning-for-tasks-that-nobody-wants-to-do/1100-6531123/

We’ve hired creatives for their talent, not for their ability to do what a machine suggests, but they can experiment with these tools to make their lives easier.

Vincke’s stance seems less supportive of AI than positions taken by other big gaming companies, including Krafton’s move to becoming “AI First” and Nexon’s CEO saying that “it’s important to assume that every game company is now using AI.” Some indie developers, on the other hand, are promoting the fact that they’re “AI free.”

            <h2>Creating psychological safety in the AI era</h2>
            <p><strong>MIT Technology Review | 2025-12-16</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/12/16/1125899/creating-psychological-safety-in-the-ai-era/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Rolling out enterprise-grade AI means climbing two steep cliffs at once. First, understanding and implementing the tech itself. And second, creating the cultural conditions where employees can maximize its value. While the technical hurdles are signiﬁcant, the human element can be even more consequential; fear and ambiguity can stall momentum of even the most promising initiatives.

Psychological safety—feeling free to express opinions and take calculated risks without worrying about career repercussions1—is essential for successful AI adoption. In psychologically safe workspaces, employees are empowered to challenge assumptions and raise concerns about new tools without fear of reprisal. This is nothing short of a necessity when introducing a nascent and profoundly powerful technology that still lacks established best practices.

“Psychological safety is mandatory in this new era of AI,” says Rafee Tarafdar, executive vice president and chief technology officer at Infosys. “The tech itself is evolving so fast—companies have to experiment, and some things will fail. There needs to be a safety net.”

To gauge how psychological safety influences success with enterprise-level AI, MIT Technology Review Insights conducted a survey of 500 business leaders. The ﬁndings reveal high self-reported levels of psychological safety, but also suggest that fear still has a foothold. Anecdotally, industry experts highlight a reason for the disconnect between rhetoric and reality: while organizations may promote a safe to experiment message publicly, deeper cultural undercurrents can counteract that intent.

Building psychological safety requires a coordinated, systems-level approach, and human resources (HR) alone cannot deliver such transformation. Instead, enterprises must deeply embed psychological safety into their collaboration processes.

This content was produced by Insights, the custom content arm of MIT Technology Review. It was not written by MIT Technology Review’s editorial staff. It was researched, designed, and written by human writers, editors, analysts, and illustrators. This includes the writing of surveys and collection of data for surveys. AI tools that may have been used were limited to secondary production processes that passed thorough human review.

The idea that machines will be as smart as—or smarter than—humans has hijacked an entire industry. But look closely and you’ll see it’s a myth that persists for many of the same reasons conspiracies do.

The experimental model won&#39;t compete with the biggest and best, but it could tell us why they behave in weird ways—and how trustworthy they really are.

They managed to cut the size of the AI reasoning model by more than half—and claim it can now answer politically sensitive questions once off limits in Chinese AI systems.

A conversation with a chatbot can shift people&#39;s political views—but the most persuasive models also spread the most misinformation.

            <div id="article-text">This is today&#39;s edition of The Download, our weekday newsletter that provides a daily dose of what&#39;s going on in the world of technology.

Some disillusionment was inevitable. When OpenAI released a free web app called ChatGPT in late 2022, it changed the course of an entire industry—and several world economies. Millions of people started talking to their computers, and their computers started talking back. We were enchanted, and we expected more.Well, 2025 has been a year of reckoning. For a start, the heads of the top AI companies made promises they couldn’t keep. At the same time, updates to the core technology are no longer the step changes they once were.To be clear, the last few years have been filled with genuine “Wow” moments. But this remarkable technology is only a few years old, and in many ways it is still experimental. Its successes come with big caveats. Read the full story to learn more about why we may need to readjust our expectations.

This story is part of our new Hype Correction package, a collection of stories designed to help you reset your expectations about what AI makes possible—and what it doesn’t.

Quantum navigation could solve the military’s GPS jamming problem

Since the 2022 invasion of Ukraine, thousands of flights have been affected by a far-reaching Russian campaign of using radio transmissions that jammed its GPS system.The growing inconvenience to air traffic and risk of a real disaster have highlighted the vulnerability of GPS and focused attention on more secure ways for planes to navigate the gauntlet of jamming and spoofing, the term for tricking a GPS receiver into thinking it’s somewhere else.One approach that’s emerging from labs is quantum navigation: exploiting the quantum nature of light and atoms to build ultra-sensitive sensors that can allow vehicles to navigate independently, without depending on satellites.

            <div id="article-text">Can I ask you a question: How do you feel about AI right now? Are you still excited? When you hear that OpenAI or Google just dropped a new model, do you still get that buzz? Or has the shine come off it, maybe just a teeny bit? Come on, you can be honest with me.

Truly, I feel kind of stupid even asking the question, like a spoiled brat who has too many toys at Christmas. AI is mind-blowing. It’s one of the most important technologies to have emerged in decades (despite all its many many drawbacks and flaws and, well, issues).

At the same time I can&#39;t help feeling a little bit: Is that it?

If you feel the same way, there’s good reason for it: The hype we have been sold for the past few years has been overwhelming. We were told that AI would solve climate change. That it would reach human-level intelligence. That it would mean we no longer had to work!

Instead we got AI slop, chatbot psychosis, and tools that urgently prompt you to write better email newsletters. Maybe we got what we deserved. Or maybe we need to reevaluate what AI is for.

That’s the reality at the heart of a new series of stories, published today, called Hype Correction. We accept that AI is still the hottest ticket in town, but it’s time to re-set our expectations.

As my colleague Will Douglas Heaven puts it in the package’s intro essay, “You can’t help but wonder: When the wow factor is gone, what’s left? How will we view this technology a year or five from now? Will we think it was worth the colossal costs, both financial and environmental?”

Elsewhere in the package, James O’Donnell looks at Sam Altman, the ultimate AI hype man, through the medium of his own words. And Alex Heath explains the AI bubble, laying out for us what it all means and what we should look out for.

Michelle Kim analyzes one of the biggest claims in the AI hype cycle: that AI would completely eliminate the need for certain classes of jobs. If ChatGPT can pass the bar, surely that means it will replace lawyers? Well, not yet, and maybe not ever.

Similarly, Edd Gent tackles the big question around AI coding. Is it as good as it sounds? Turns out the jury is still out. And elsewhere David Rotman looks at the real-world work that needs to be done before AI materials discovery has its breakthrough ChatGPT moment.

Meanwhile, Garrison Lovely spends time with some of the biggest names in the AI safety world and asks: Are the doomers still okay? I mean, now that people are feeling a bit less scared about their impending demise at the hands of superintelligent AI? And Margaret Mitchell reminds us that hype around generative AI can blind us to the AI breakthroughs we should really celebrate.

Let’s remember: AI was here before ChatGPT and it will be here after. This hype cycle has been wild, and we don’t know what its lasting impact will be. But AI isn’t going anywhere. We shouldn&#39;t be so surprised that those dreams we were sold haven’t come true—yet.

The more likely story is that the real winners, the killer apps, are still to come. And a lot of money is being bet on that prospect. So yes: The hype could never sustain itself over the short term. Where we’re at now is maybe the start of a post-hype phase. In an ideal world, this hype correction will reset expectations.

            <div id="article-text">When OpenAI announced its new shopping search capabilities, I took the news with a grain of salt (perhaps the whole shaker).
For the past decade, we have watched the slow evolution of traditional search engines. What began as tools for pure information discovery gradually morphed into ecosystems dominated by SEO-optimized content and sponsored results. My initial fear with ChatGPT’s update was simple: Are we seeing the beginning of a similar shift? Is the purity of the “reasoning engine” being diluted by the necessity of commerce?
After testing the new shopping integration, the results suggest that we are at a pivotal moment in the user experience of Generative AI, one that requires an open discussion about what we actually want these tools to be.

The defining characteristic of Large Language Models (LLMs) is their ability to handle nuance. When we interact with ChatGPT, we expect a Socratic dialogue. We expect the AI to ask clarifying questions to narrow down our intent.
To test this, I entered a simple prompt: “I want to buy a vacuum.”
I anticipated a conversation, questions about my home’s square footage, my floor type, or my budget. Instead, the conversational nuance was replaced by a display that felt familiar: a grid of product photos, names, prices, and direct links to retailers.

While efficient, this experience felt like a regression. It mirrored the “keyword search” experience of Web 2.0 rather than the “intent-based” promise of GenAI. It replied to my prompt, but it stripped away the intelligence.

Scrolling down, I engaged with the new feature in a call to action: “Research the best vacuums.”
This is where the user experience (UX) friction became most apparent. Rather than synthesizing data or comparing technical specifications in a chat format, the tool presented a polling interface designed to filter results.

The experience is oddly time-sensitive; pause too long to think or drink water, and the screens will skip forward, dumping you back into a list of product cards.
The interface presents products with a binary choice: “More like this” or “Not interested.” It offers brand names and price tags, but virtually no information to help the user actually make a choice.

For a user seeking genuine research, being presented with a list of brands and prices without deep comparative analysis feels like a missed opportunity.
It raises a question: If I wanted to filter products by price and brand, wouldn’t I use a traditional retailer? The value proposition of Gen AI should be synthesis, not just aggregation.

The Tension Between Reasoning and Revenue
This update highlights the inevitable tension facing major AI companies: the balance between user utility and business sustainability.
As OpenAI scales, the pressure to demonstrate revenue models to investors is natural. However, there is a risk in prioritizing transactional features before the core product, reasoning and logic, is fully matured. By introducing a shopping experience that feels closer to a “click-through” engine than a “knowledge” engine, the platform risks blurring its own identity.
Is ChatGPT a research partner that helps me think? Or is it a shopping assistant trying to speed me to checkout?

To be clear, I believe there is a place for shopping within AI. But the execution matters.
A truly Generative AI shopping experience shouldn’t just list products; it should understand the user. It should read between the lines of a prompt to understand that a user asking for a vacuum might actually be solving a problem about pet hair or allergies.

The current iteration feels like a beta test of a business model rather than an evolution of intelligence. As we move forward, the hope is that OpenAI will refine this tool to prioritize the “Chat” over the transaction. We don’t want it to be just another place to see ads. We need a better way to make decisions.

            <div id="article-text">Tekpon has acquired 100% of the TNW media and events brands, which cover and convene the European technology ecosystem, from the FT.

The transaction is Tekpon’s largest investment in media and events so far. It broadens the company’s reach across SaaS and AI and strengthens its role in the global innovation landscape.

TNW’s brand and editorial standards will be maintained, while its events and digital platforms will be integrated into Tekpon’s wider strategy.

The FT will continue to own and operate TNW Spaces, Amsterdam’s dynamic tech hub, offering private offices and coworking spaces that support a thriving community of startups, scale-ups, and innovators.

TNW is one of Europe’s most respected technology brands. Its legacy, its community, and its influence have shaped the European tech scene for nearly twenty years. This acquisition accelerates our mission to connect the global SaaS and AI ecosystem and supports Europe’s position in the next decade of innovation.

Tekpon will begin working on TNW branded initiatives immediately. Plans for 2026 include an expanded TNW Conference, new SaaS and AI program tracks curated by Tekpon, cross-regional executive programmes, and specialised gatherings for founders, executives, and investors.

The acquisition is part of Tekpon’s long-term plan to build an international ecosystem connecting software, media, events, advisory, and innovation.

            <div id="article-text">This article was published on September 29, 2025

A few decades ago, when I was raising funding for a startup, I made a lasting impression on an investor by not only talking about how successful we would be, but also highlighting what would happen if we weren’t. Later, in an informal setting, I asked him what had persuaded him to invest in us. He told me that during the pitch, I had said, “And if all our predictions and expectations are wrong, we will use the last of our funding for a magnificent farewell dinner for all our investors. You’ll have lost your money, but at least you’ll get a great evening for it in return.”

I don’t recall this being part of the original pitch or my strategy. I probably just blurted it out to break the ice, but it impressed the investor. He told me it was refreshing to speak to an entrepreneur who was not blinded by his own pitch. The fact that I had a scenario ready for both success and failure told him that I was honest and realistic.

Now, the startup was not successful, but we still had a nice, opulent dinner with the investors at the end — and we did them one better. As soon as we realised that our predictions and expectations were wrong, we made our investors an offer: we could struggle and pivot and hope for a miracle, or we could return what was left of our funding to our investors. We preferred option two, and so did they, so everybody got some money back (about 40% of what they had invested), as well as a lovely evening with excellent food and drinks. When we raised money for another startup a few years later, almost all of them signed up in our first round.

Obviously, I would have preferred to have made this startup a success instead, but I still regard it as a successful endeavour. I gave it a try and had a plan ready for when my experiment didn’t work out, and in the process, I built relationships that outlasted that one startup.

TNW City Coworking space - Where your best work happens

A workspace designed for growth, collaboration, and endless networking opportunities in the heart of tech.

As you may have read, The Next Web, the company I founded in 2006, is nearing the end of its lifecycle. The events and media business is being wound down, and only TNW Spaces will live on. TNW Programs was sold off a while ago and will continue as well. There won’t be another TNW Conference, and soon there won’t be new articles on the site; people are losing their jobs, including me. It’s a painful process, but I guess I’m taking it well because it also feels natural and logical. When we sold TNW to the FT in 2019, we were very ambitious and optimistic, and surely I would’ve liked for the company and brand to outlive me. However, when the business struggled, I also felt very comfortable with the company ending graciously.

When you’re reading a good book, there’s a moment near the end when you’ll start reading slower because you don’t want it to end. I love those moments, because I’ll know it’s been a good experience. But then you also know that good stories need good endings. So, this is the ending of a great story that I’ve enjoyed participating in.

I’ll keep writing, but this will be my last official TNW story. I’d love it if you would subscribe to my writing over at Substack. It will be less tech-focused, more unpredictable, but just as insightful as before.
