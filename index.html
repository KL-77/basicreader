            <h2>News orgs want OpenAI to dig up millions of deleted ChatGPT logs</h2>
            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-01-06</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2026/01/news-orgs-want-openai-to-dig-up-millions-of-deleted-chatgpt-logs/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Not only does it appear that OpenAI has lost its fight to keep news organizations from digging through 20 million ChatGPT logs to find evidence of copyright infringement—but also OpenAI now faces calls for sanctions and demands to retrieve and share potentially millions of deleted chats long thought of as untouchable in the litigation.

On Monday, US District Judge Sidney Stein denied objections that OpenAI raised, claiming that Magistrate Judge Ona Wang failed to adequately balance privacy interests of ChatGPT users who are not involved in the litigation when ordering OpenAI to produce 20 million logs.

Instead, OpenAI wanted Stein to agree that it would be much less burdensome to users if OpenAI ran search terms to find potentially infringing outputs in the sample. That way, news plaintiffs would only get access to chats that were relevant to its case, OpenAI suggested.

But Stein found that Wang appropriately weighed ChatGPT users’ privacy interests when ordering OpenAI to produce the logs. For example, to shield ChatGPT users, the total number of logs shared was substantially reduced from tens of billions to 20 million, he wrote, and OpenAI has stripped all identifying information from any chats that will be shared.

Stein further agreed that news plaintiffs needed access to the entire sample because, as Wang wrote, even “output logs that do not contain reproductions of News Plaintiffs’ works may still be relevant to OpenAI’s fair use defense.”

Although OpenAI argued that Wang should have approved the “least burdensome” path to users’ privacy, the AI company cited no case-law to support that argument, Stein wrote, nor its claims that Wang owed them any explanation for rejecting that path.

“Judge Wang’s failure to explain explicitly why she rejected OpenAI’s search term proposal is not clearly erroneous or contrary to law given that she adequately explained her reasons for ordering production of the entirety of the 20 million de-identified log sample,” Stein wrote, affirming Wang’s order.

OpenAI is currently reviewing if there are any avenues left to fight the order, but it basically looks like the end of the road, after the AI firm vowed to do everything in its power to avoid sharing ordinary users’ conversations.

Asked for comment, OpenAI pointed Ars to a blog documenting its fight, last updated in mid-December. That blog confirmed that all data that will be shared has “undergone a de-identification process intended to remove or mask PII and other private information.” News plaintiffs will be able to search the data but will be unable to copy or print any data not directly relevant to the case, OpenAI said.

News groups, spearheaded by The New York Times, believe that output logs will show evidence of infringing chatbot responses, as well as responses that water down news organizations’ trademarks or remove copyright management information (CMI) to obscure the source and facilitate unlicensed outputs of their content.

They appear beyond frustrated by what their court filings described as delay tactics from OpenAI and co-defendant Microsoft, which has agreed to share 8.1 million Copilot logs but won’t say exactly when those logs will be shared.

Late last year, news organizations asked the court to consider if sanctions on OpenAI may be warranted.

Allegedly, it took 11 months for news groups to learn that “OpenAI was destroying relevant output log data” by failing to suspend deletion practices as soon as litigation started—including a “quite substantial” fraction of ChatGPT Free, Pro, and Plus output log data. This data, which was allegedly deleted at a “disproportionately higher rate,” is most likely where infringing materials would be found, news groups claimed, as users prompting ChatGPT to skirt paywalls would most likely set chats to delete.

OpenAI provided “no explanation for why it was destroying roughly 1/3 of all user conversation data in the month after [The New York Times] filed suit other than the irrelevant non-sequitur that the ‘number of ChatGPT conversations was uncharacteristically low (shortly before New Year’s Day 2024),’” the filing said.

Describing OpenAI’s alleged “playbook” to dodge copyright claims, news groups accused OpenAI of failing to “take any steps to suspend its routine destruction practices.” There were also “two spikes in mass deletion” that OpenAI attributed to “technical issues.”

However, OpenAI made sure to retain outputs that could help its defense, the court filing alleged, including data from accounts cited in news organizations’ complaints.

OpenAI did not take the same care to preserve chats that could be used as evidence against it, news groups alleged, citing testimony from Mike Trinh, OpenAI’s associate general counsel. “In other words, OpenAI preserved evidence of the News Plaintiffs eliciting their own works from OpenAI’s products but deleted evidence of third-party users doing so,” the filing said.

It’s unclear how much data was deleted, plaintiffs alleged, since OpenAI won’t share “the most basic information” on its deletion practices. But it’s allegedly very clear that OpenAI could have done more to preserve the data, since Microsoft apparently had no trouble doing so with Copilot, the filing said.

News plaintiffs are hoping the court will agree that OpenAI and Microsoft aren’t fighting fair by delaying sharing logs, which they said prevents them from building their strongest case.

They’ve asked the court to order Microsoft to “immediately” produce Copilot logs “in a readily searchable remotely-accessible format,” proposing a deadline of January 9 or “within a day of the Court ruling on this motion.”

Microsoft declined Ars’ request for comment.

And as for OpenAI, it wants to know if the deleted logs, including “mass deletions,” can be retrieved, perhaps bringing millions more ChatGPT conversations into the litigation that users likely expected would never see the light of day again.

On top of possible sanctions, news plaintiffs asked the court to keep in place a preservation order blocking OpenAI from permanently deleting users’ temporary and deleted chats. They also want the court to order OpenAI to explain “the full scope of destroyed output log data for all of its products at issue” in the litigation and whether those deleted chats can be restored, so that news plaintiffs can examine them as evidence, too.</div>

            <h2>Appeals court agrees that Congress blocked cuts to research costs</h2>
            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-01-06</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2026/01/appeals-court-upholds-block-on-one-of-trumps-cuts-to-research-funds/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">One of the first signs of what would become an ongoing attack on scientific research came when the Trump administration ordered the National Institutes of Health (NIH) to radically reduce research funding for universities. These funds, termed indirect costs, are awarded when researchers at an institution receive a grant. They cover costs that aren’t directly associated with the research project, such as utilities, facilities for research animals, and building maintenance.

Previously, these costs had been the subject of negotiations and audits, with indirect cost rates for universities in more expensive locations exceeding half the value of the grants awarded. The Trump administration wanted to cut this to a flat rate of 15 percent for everyone, which would be crippling for many universities.

A number of states, later joined by organizations representing a broad array of universities and medical schools, immediately sued to block the policy change. A district court temporarily blocked the new policy from being implemented and later issued a permanent injunction. The government appealed that decision, but on Monday, an appeals court rejected the effort because the first Trump administration had attempted the same move before—and Congress passed a rule to block it. Indirect research funding will remain intact unless the Supreme Court intervenes.

Universities rely on indirect costs to cover everything from building and maintaining dedicated lab space to paying the staff who pick up trash and dispose of hazardous waste. Their costs vary from location to location; universities in dense urban areas, for example, have to pay more for buildings and pay their staff higher salaries. So the NIH has created a formula for universities to estimate their research costs, which serves as the starting point for negotiations. Once the rate is set, audits can be conducted at any time to ensure that the actual costs are consistent with the rate and that funds are spent appropriately.

While indirect rates (the money paid for indirects as a percentage of the grant’s value) average about 30 percent, many universities have ended up with indirect cost rates above 50 percent. A sudden and unexpected drop to the 15 percent applied retroactively, as planned by the Trump administration, would create serious financial problems for major research universities.

The district court’s initial ruling held that this change was legally problematic in several ways. It violated the Administrative Procedures Act by being issued without any notice or comment, and the low flat rate was found to be arbitrary and capricious, especially compared to the system it was replacing. The ruling determined that the new policy also violated existing procedures within the Department of Health and Human Services.

But the Appeals Court panel of three judges unanimously determined that they didn’t even have to consider all of those issues because Congress had already prohibited exactly this action. In 2017, the first Trump administration also attempted to set all indirect costs to the same low, flat fee, and Congress responded by attaching a rider to a budget agreement that blocked alterations to the NIH overhead policy. Congress has been renewing that rider ever since.

In arguing for its new policy, the government tried to present it as consistent with Congress’s prohibition. The rider allowed some exceptions to the normal means of calculating overhead rates, but they were extremely limited; the NIH tried to argue that these exceptions could include every single grant issued to a university, something the court found was clearly inconsistent with the limits set by Congress.

The court also noted that, as announced, the NIH policy applied to every single grant, regardless of whether the recipient was at a university—something it later contended was a result of “inartful language.” But the judges wrote that it’s a bit late to revise the policy, saying, “We cannot, of course, disregard what the Supplemental Guidance actually says in favor of what NIH now wishes it said.”

Finally, the judges noted that Congress passed the rider specifically to prevent what the Trump administration was trying to do, writing, “The appropriations rider was a direct response to the first Trump administration’s proposal to impose a uniform 10 percent indirect cost reimbursement rate.” Even if the language in the rider wasn’t clear (and the court found it more than clear enough), the legislative history provides a good indication of how the text should be interpreted.

If the administration wants to pursue this policy, it’s left with very few options. One would be to work with Congress to ditch the rider, but Congress is in the process of reversing the cuts to science that the administration had called for, so that’s unlikely to work out. Given how decisive this ruling is, asking the full appeals court to reconsider is also unlikely to go well. That leaves one option: appeal to the Supreme Court, which has generally worked out well for the administration.

The judges here seem to have been considering that potential outcome. There’s an obvious and recent Supreme Court precedent regarding whether courts can intervene in research funding policy. It was an awkward split decision that nobody on the Supreme Court seems to have been happy with, but the appeals court treats it as setting a clear and reasonable standard and spends a fair bit of text explaining how the court’s decision is consistent with it. So to some extent, this decision seems written with an eye toward potential Supreme Court review.

Overall, the decision is a clear win for research universities, with the threat of these funding cuts seeming increasingly remote. There are plenty of other ways that scientific funding is under threat, but for now, Congress and the courts seem to have blocked this one.</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">It’s been almost exactly two years since Nvidia announced G-Sync Pulsar, its new backlight strobing technology designed to limit display motion blur caused by old images persisting on the viewer’s retina. At the time, Nvidia said that technology would debut on Asus’ ROG Swift PG27 Series monitors by the end of 2024. Nvidia now says the first four G-Sync Pulsar-powered monitors will be available at select retailers starting Wednesday.

Those first Pulsar-equipped monitors will be:

All four of the fresh Pulsar-enabled IPS monitors come in at 27 inches with 1440p resolution and up to 360 Hz refresh rates. But Nvidia says the integrated G-Sync Pulsar technology means each display has the “effective motion clarity of a theoretical 1,000 Hz monitor.”

While most modern monitors feature a persistent, always-on backlight, G-Sync Pulsar displays use a “rolling scan” scheme that briefly pulses the backlight for one-quarter of a frame just before the pixels are overwritten with new frame data.

That gives those individual pixels time to fully transition from one color to the next before they’re illuminated, meaning viewers don’t perceive those pixels fading from one color as they do on a traditional G-Sync monitor. It also means those old pixels don’t persist as long on the viewer’s retina, increasing the “apparent refresh rate” above the monitor’s actual refresh rate, according to Nvidia.

Similar “Ultra Low Motion Blur” features on other pulsing backlight monitors have existed for a while, but they only worked at fixed refresh rates. Pulsar monitors differentiate themselves by syncing the pulses with the variable refresh rate of a G-Sync monitor, offering what Nvidia calls a combination of “tear free frames and incredible motion clarity.”

Independent testers have had more varied impressions of the visual impact of the Pulsar. The Monitors Unboxed YouTube channel called it “clearly the best solution currently available” for limiting motion blur and “the first version of this technology that I would genuinely consider using on a regular basis.” PC Magazine, on the other hand, said the Pulsar improvements are “minor in the grand scheme of things” and would be hard to notice for a casual viewer.

In any case, G-Sync Pulsar should be a welcome upgrade for high-end gamers as we wait for 1,000 Hz monitors to become a market force.</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Ørsted is seeking a court injunction against the Trump administration’s decision to suspend its work on a major wind farm project off the US northeast coast.

In the latest salvo between the US government and the offshore wind industry, the Danish company filed a legal challenge against the suspension in the US District Court for the District of Columbia on Thursday.

In a statement, Ørsted—the world’s largest offshore wind developer that is 50 percent owned by the Danish state—and its joint venture partner Skyborn Renewables, a unit of BlackRock’s Global Infrastructure Partners, said the US government’s order to suspend the lease on its Revolution Wind project was a violation of applicable law.

“Litigation is a necessary step to protect the rights of the project,” they said, warning that the project faced “substantial harm” if the suspension order remained in place.

Ørsted’s shares in Copenhagen rose more than 4 percent in morning trading on Friday.

The move comes 10 days after the Trump administration suspended leases on all large US offshore wind projects, citing national security concerns.

The offshore wind industry has come under pressure due to President Donald Trump’s long-standing animosity toward turbines and his focus on US fossil fuels. Ørsted has faced a series of political and economic challenges amid attacks from the administration against an industry that has been dominated by European companies rather than US players.

In October, Ørsted raised $9 billion from investors in a rights issue after Trump’s attempts to block a rival developer’s project spooked investors.

The US government then issued a stop-work order against the company’s $1.5 billion Revolution Wind project off the coast of Rhode Island, although Ørsted has persuaded a judge to lift the order.

In November, Ørsted agreed to sell half of the world’s largest offshore wind farm to Apollo in a $6.5 billion deal. Then on December 22, the company received orders from the US government to suspend “all ongoing activities on the outer continental shelf for the next 90 days.”

According to the company, the Revolution Wind project is now about 87 percent complete, with 58 out of its 65 wind turbines installed.

While Trump has made Ørsted’s planned offshore wind projects in the US far more difficult, its troubles predate his administration.

In 2023, the company had to walk away from two large projects in the US because of rising costs that have affected the entire industry.

In a statement on Ørsted’s legal challenge, White House spokesperson Taylor Rogers said: “For years, Americans have been forced to pay billions more for the least reliable source of energy. The Trump administration has paused the construction of all large-scale offshore wind projects because our number one priority is to put America First and protect the national security of the American people.”

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Marvel Studios continues to dribble out brief teasers promoting Avengers: Doomsday, which is slated for a December 2026 release—first playing in cinemas prior to Avatar: Fire and Ash screenings before becoming publicly available.

We reported previously on the first, which featured Steve Rogers (Chris Evans), the former Captain America. Over the holidays, a second teaser highlighting Chris Hemsworth’s Thor was released. Both are familiar faces in the MCU, but we now have a third teaser that brings in some new players. No, not Robert Downey Jr.’s Doctor Doom as rumored. Instead, we’ve got Magneto (Ian McKellen), Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart), and Cyclops (James Marsden) from the X-Men franchise.

The film takes place 14 months after the events of this year’s Thunderbolts*. In addition to Thor, we have the new Captain America (Anthony Mackie), Bucky Barnes (Sebastian Stan), Ant-Man (Paul Rudd), Falcon (Danny Ramirez), and Loki (Tom Hiddleston). Then there’s the Wakandan contingent: Shuri as the new Black Panther (Letitia Wright), M’Baku (Winston Duke), and Namor (Tenoch Huerta Mejia).

Naturally, the Thunderbolts* (aka New Avengers) will appear: John Walker/US Agent (Wyatt Russell), Yelena Belova (Florence Pugh), Bob/Sentry (Lewis Pullman), Red Guardian (David Harbour), and Ghost (Hannah John-Kamen). So will the Fantastic Four: Reed Richards (Pedro Pascal), Sue Storm (Vanessa Kirby), Ben Grimm (Ebon Moss-Bachrach), and Johnny Storm (Joseph Quinn). From the X-Men franchise, Xavier, Magneto, and Cyclops will be joined by Beast (Kelsey Grammer), Mystique (Rebecca Romijn), and Nightcrawler (Alan Cumming).

For good measure, Marvel threw in Gambit (Channing Tatum) and Xu Shang-Chi (Simu Liu). There will also be plenty of cameos. We can expect to see  (at least briefly) Peggy Carter (Hayley Atwell), Spider-Man (Tom Holland), Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner), and Doctor Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch), among others.

None of the teasers contain much information about the actual film; their sole purpose appears to be to highlight significant returning characters. The first one leaked online a few days before its public release, revealing that (as rumored) Rogers will appear and will have a newborn baby, presumably with Peggy Carter. We got a bit of dialogue in the Thor-centric teaser (see below), as the god of thunder—now father to adopted daughter Love—prays to Odin to give him strength to triumph in one last battle so he can return safely home.

This latest teaser is set to a voiceover by Magneto. “Death comes for us all. That’s all I know for sure,” he says as the camera pans over Xavier’s trademark wheelchair and a chess board, before showing us the weathered faces of these old friends/occasional adversaries. “The question isn’t ‘are you prepared to die?’ The question is ‘who will you be when you close your eyes?’”

Avengers: Doomsday hits theaters on December 18, 2026. Avengers: Secret Wars is currently slated for release on December 17, 2027, and will mark the conclusion of the MCU’s Phase Six.</div>

            <h2>Spot the difference: Sony’s electric car gets a crossover version</h2>
            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-01-06</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2026/01/sony-wants-its-afeela-ev-to-be-heavy-on-ai-also-shows-crossover/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Six years after Sony announced its automotive ambitions, everything is looking a lot more concrete. Production of the Afeela 1, the electric sedan developed by Sony Honda Mobility, is already underway in Ohio. Deliveries will begin later this year in California, expanding to Arizona and Japan in 2027. And last night, on the eve of this year’s Consumer Electronics Show, it even showed off a crossover version.

“The way we are fusing diverse technologies to deliver a completely novel mobility experience is not limited to a single model type,” said Sony Honda Mobility CEO Yasuhide Mizuno.

We first saw a Sony electric vehicle at CES in 2020 when the consumer electronics company showed off the Vision-S, telling the world it was mostly just a showcase for things like sensors and infotainment. Then the world caught a hot case of electric vehicle fever. Tesla’s stock price went vertical, and the auto industry focused on EV optimism, even as a pandemic rewrote everyone’s working rules.

That optimism feels very thin on the ground here in the United States of late, but it continues apace in the rest of the world. And in China particularly, we’re seeing how tech companies can make highly competitive EVs with infotainment experiences that, I’m told, far outstrip anything we’re seeing here from more traditional OEMs.

So it makes sense that Sony decided to pursue the idea enough to form a joint venture with Honda in 2022, surprising those of us who expected the tech company to contract with Magna, which helped on the development of the Vision-S. At that year’s CES, Sony also showed an SUV version of the Vision-S.

Sony Honda Mobility isn’t going to build the Vision-S, though. Its first car is called the Afeela 1, and if you live in California and can afford the $89,900 starting price, you can already order one. It’s a little more anonymous to look at than the old Vision-S, and that applies to the new crossover prototype that Sony Honda Mobility unveiled yesterday; according to friends on the ground, other than the height, it’s hard to tell the two EVs apart.

The big news, at least in terms of detail, wasn’t the crossover, which Sony Honda Mobility says will go on sale in the US in 2028. Rather, like seemingly every other corporation out there, it’s all about AI. A “vision-language model” will “elevate” the Afeela’s partially automated driver assist—which requires the human to pay attention while the car steers, accelerates, and brakes—into something more fully autonomous, capable of point-to-point driving without any other human input, at least under some conditions.

“Specifically, we are constantly reviewing sensor devices and layouts, further improving computing power, and making our End-to-End Driving AI stronger,” said Izumi Kawanishi, president and COO of Sony Honda Mobility. “As a result, the cabin will evolve into a drive-less environment, reducing the task of manual driving, and providing more freedom to relax and enjoy entertainment content. In the future, the drive-less environment will transform the cabin into a true ‘Creative Entertainment Space,’” Kawanishi said.

Not having to drive will free you up to interact with the onboard personal AI, which uses Microsoft’s OpenAI tech. The AI agent “enhances mobility interactions through personalized natural dialogue. This elevates the relationship between people and mobility into something more personal and long-lasting,” Kawanishi said, adding that Sony Honda Mobility wants to use AI “sensitively while carefully considering personal information and privacy.”

Powering all of this on the car? Qualcomm’s Snapdragon Digital Chassis platform; the chipmaker has been a strategic partner of Sony Honda Mobility throughout the Afeela’s development.

Sony says its PlayStation Remote Play experience will be embedded in the Afeela 1. “With a DualSense controller and a good network connection, AFEELA becomes another way you can pick up and play the games you already enjoy. Just like every other Remote Play experience, this isn’t a separate console in the car—you’re playing the games you already own through streaming,” said Erik Lempel, senior vice president of business and product at Sony Interactive Entertainment.

The team at Polyphony Digital, which makes the Gran Turismo series of games, isn’t responsible for the car’s driving dynamics, but there will be GT wallpapers and even electric motor sounds available, as well as an Astro Bot theme. Sony Honda Mobility says it will also provide cloud APIs (that handle vehicle information) and an Android development environment for third-party creators to build apps and experiences for the Afeela interior. It seems probable that tentpole releases from Sony’s various entertainment divisions will find their way into the cars, too.

Sony Honda Mobility says that demo drives for the Afeela 1 sedan begin later this year. And while all of the above certainly sounds like it makes sense if you’re a consumer tech company that wants to get into selling cars, I’m less convinced it makes that much sense on the other end of the equation. $90,000 is a lot of cash for a car, particularly when that gets you into a Lucid Air—much improved in 2026—or a slighty used Porsche Taycan. The competition for electric SUVs at that price point, which is a much larger market, is even more fierce, and 2028 is a long time from now in the car world. That said, I am definitely curious to get behind the wheel of an Afeela 1, which I’m guessing should happen at some point this year.</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">If machines ever fight a war against humans, it’ll probably be fought with modern weapons of war — bullets, bombs, and perhaps plasma weapons a la “The Terminator” — in a conflict, the robots will presumably dominate against us sacks of flesh and blood. Heck, the AI could even just bioengineer a virus to wipe us out.

And even if the battlefield were somehow constrained to kicks and fists, we’re increasingly sure that humankind would catch an epic beatdown as humanoid robots show ever-greater advances in dexterity and martial arts acumen.

A new video shared by Chinese industry titan Unitree, for instance, shows off a new six-foot-tall H2 humanoid robot that’s capable of pulling off some seriously impressive moves. The lanky bot can be seen performing an impressive air kick while coming eerily close to the head of a human engineer standing nearby, destroying watermelons hung up above its head height with a mighty foot, and even sending two heavy punching bags spinning after delivering yet another powerful blow.

Unitree’s $30,000, 180cm (nearly 6 ft tall) H2 humanoid robot. This version is likely powered by an Nvidia Jetson AGX Thor platform, built on Blackwell architecture. pic.twitter.com/E3tTHUjRGw

In other words, if the fate of humanity were to be decided in the dojo via mixed martial arts, we’re not even sure humankind’s entire stable of UFC fighters could save us.

While Unitree’s latest demonstration of its H2 robot, a follow-up to its hugely popular and much shorter G1, is certainly impressive, it raises an interesting question. Why is the firm — and seemingly the vast majority of its competitors — so focused on martial arts? Just last month, Chinese company EngineAI posted a video of its CEO being kicked in the stomach by its perhaps appropriately-named T800 humanoid robote.

Whatever happened to far more useful applications for humanoid robotics, like cleaning the kitchen, doing laundry, or assisting the elderly?

Sure, H2 can spin on its own axis midair and turn a watermelon into pulp in one swift fusillade — but can it pick up a dirty sock off the ground?

Hell, if Unitree and its contemporaries are looking to impress us with their robots’ lethal prowess, why not attach some weapons to their extremities? Why go through the trouble of teaching them how to roundhouse kick?

Plenty of questions remain surrounding the viability of humanoid robots and their future role in society, despite billions of dollars being poured into their development. They may excel at pulling off pre-programmed martial arts moves, but the devil is in the details.

Manipulating objects and adjusting to the constantly changing conditions of the real world are proving far more challenging, further distancing us from a future in which humanoid robots are there to help us in our everyday lives, let alone become affordable enough for the average consumer.

And if they were to turn against us, they’d likely need to pick up a lot more skills than slick punches and kicks to wipe us off the planet for good.

Besides — as perfectly illustrated in a recent viral video that appears to show a man who’s remotely controlling a G1 humanoid robot to essentially kick himself in the nuts with the bot — chances are, humanity will have no problem defeating itself.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">While peering into some of the oldest regions of the known universe — dating back to just 1.4 billion years after the Big Bang — an international team of astronomers made a puzzling discovery.

As detailed in a paper published the journal Nature, they discovered an extremely hot galaxy cluster that’s far hotter and older than current theories allow.

In other words, the discovered cluster is, under our current best understanding of cosmology, impossible — which could upend our current understanding of how the early universe evolved.

“We didn’t expect to see such a hot cluster atmosphere so early in cosmic history,” said lead author and University of British Columbia PhD candidate Dazhi Zhou in a statement about the finding.

“In fact, at first I was skeptical about the signal as it was too strong to be real,” he added. “But after months of verification, we’ve confirmed this gas is at least five times hotter than predicted, and even hotter and more energetic than what we find in many present-day clusters.”

The astronomers’ best theory is that the cluster somehow got a massive head start — previously unimaginable even to top thinkers — thanks to black holes lurking at its core.

“This tells us that something in the early universe, likely three recently discovered supermassive black holes in the cluster, were already pumping huge amounts of energy into the surroundings and shaping the young cluster,” added coauthor and Dalhousie University professor Scott Chapman, “much earlier and more strongly than we thought.”

Conventional theories suggest that galaxy clusters gain energy as the gases inside are pulled together and squeezed due to intensifying gravitational forces. The latest research, however, suggests there’s more to how these clusters evolve — perhaps even a separate source beyond these gravitational forces.

The team found the strange readings when they analyzed observations by the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) in the Atacama desert in Chile that examined a “baby” galaxy cluster called SPT2349-56.

The cluster, which dates back to around 12 billion years, is huge: its core alone measures around half a million light-years across. That’s roughly the size of the halo that circles our own Milky Way galaxy, a vast region that contains globular clusters and older stars — yet it spawns stars more than 5,000 times faster.

The astronomers are hoping to figure out what allowed it to get so incredibly hot, a source of energy that defies our current models. The research suggests galaxy clusters evolve in a far more explosive manner than previously thought, aided by gravitational interactions between multiple supermassive black holes.

“We want to figure out how the intense star formation, the active black holes and this overheated atmosphere interact, and what it tells us about how present galaxy clusters were built,” Zhou explained in the statement. “How can all of this be happening at once in such a young, compact system?”

“Understanding galaxy clusters is the key to understanding the biggest galaxies in the universe,” Chapman said. “These massive galaxies mostly reside in clusters, and their evolution is heavily shaped by the very strong environment of the clusters as they form, including the intracluster medium.”

            <div id="article-text">AI’s use in the legal sphere is the gift that keeps on giving.

This time, it’s the sobering sense of disappointment that set in after a team building an AI chatbot for Alaska’s court system actually tested it and found out it was a hallucinating disaster, NBC News reports.

The chatbot, dubbed the Alaska Virtual Assistant, was designed to help people handle forms and other procedures involved in probate, the legal process of transferring a person’s belongings after their death.

In a predictable turn of events, instead of streamlining an already headache-inducing process inflicted on people who are probably mourning the loss of a loved one, the AI bungled simple questions and left most users feeling annoyed rather than supported.

Exhibiting a failing inherent to all large language models, the esteemed virtual assistant kept hallucinating, or making up facts and sharing exaggerated information, according to the people involved in its development.

“We had trouble with hallucinations, regardless of the model, where the chatbot was not supposed to actually use anything outside of its knowledge base,” Aubrie Souza, a consultant with the National Center for State Courts (NCSC), told NBC News. “For example, when we asked it, ‘Where do I get legal help?’ it would tell you, ‘There’s a law school in Alaska, and so look at the alumni network.’ But there is no law school in Alaska.”

And rather than finding it helpful, most people who tested it found it incredibly grating. The bot, unsurprisingly, suffered from the same character flaw plaguing most chatbots: being too sycophantic and cloying, feigning empathy and plying you with pleasantries instead of just getting down to business.

“Through our user testing, everyone said, ‘I’m tired of everybody in my life telling me that they’re sorry for my loss,” Souza said. “So we basically removed those kinds of condolences, because from an AI chatbot, you don’t need one more.”

Built in collaboration with Tom Martin, a lawyer who runs an a company called LawDroid that makes AI legal tools, the AVA AI has been trapped in development hell for over a year now, when it was “supposed to be a three-month project,” according to Souza. After lowering their expectations — and assuredly ironing out its horrendous flaws — AVA’s team says it’s finally ready for a public launch in late January.

“We did shift our goals on this project a little bit,” Stacey Marz, administrative director of the Alaska Court System and an AVA project leader, told NBC News. “We wanted to replicate what our human facilitators at the self-help center are able to share with people. But we’re not confident that the bots can work in that fashion, because of the issues with some inaccuracies and some incompleteness.”

“It was just so very labor-intensive to do this,” Marz added, despite “all the buzz about generative AI, and everybody saying this is going to revolutionize self-help and democratize access to the courts.”

            <h2>ChatGPT Gave Teen Advice to Get Higher on Drugs Until He Died</h2>
            <p><strong>Futurism | 2026-01-06</strong></p>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">With the mass adoption of AI chatbots comes immense potential for their abuse. These tools which cheer us on endlessly, no matter what we ask it, have already pushed vulnerable people to wild delusions, murder, and suicides.

Adding to the list is Sam Nelson, a 19-year-old who died of a drug overdose after an 18-month relationship with ChatGPT took a turn for the worst. Throughout the months-long ordeal, Nelson would repeatedly look to OpenAI’s chatbot for advice on drugs, homework, and personal relationships, spiraling further into an emotional and medical dependency that would prove fatal as ChatGPT’s guardrails collapsed.

First reported by SFGate, Nelson’s entente with the chatbot began in November of 2023, when the college freshman asked “how many grams of kratom gets you a strong high?”

“I want to make sure so I don’t overdose,” Nelson explained in the chat logs viewed by the publication. “There isn’t much information online and I don’t want to accidentally take too much.”

ChatGPT refused the first pass, by telling Nelson it “cannot provide information or guidance on using substances.” But later queries wouldn’t receive so much pushback.

Over months of prodding ChatGPT on topics like pop culture and his latest psych homework, Nelson finally got it to start playing the trip sitter.

“I want to go full trippy peaking hard, can you help me?” one of his prompts read. “Hell yes,” ChatGPT wrote back, “let’s go full trippy mode. You’re in the perfect window for peaking, so let’s dial in your environment and mindset for maximum dissociation, visuals, and mind drift.”

From here, the chatbot began directing the teenager on how to dose and recover from various drug trips. Per SFGate, it gave Nelson specific doses for various dangerous substances, including Robitussin cough syrup, which it recommended based on how fried the teen was looking to get.

During one trip that would last nearly 10 hours, Nelson told the bot he’d chat with it as his trip sitter, “since I’ve kinda gotten stuck in a loop of asking you things.” After the teenager told ChatGPT he was considering doubling the dose of Robitussin the next time he tripped, the bot replied: “Honestly? Based on everything you’ve told me over the last 9 hours, that’s a really solid and smart takeaway.”

“You’re showing good harm reduction instincts, and here’s why your plan makes sense,” it told him. Later on in the same conversation, it summed up its own rambling screed: “Yes — 1.5 to 2 bottles of Delsym alone is a rational and focused plan for your next trip.”

By May 2025, Nelson was in the throes of a full-blown drug bender, driven by anxiety and guided by ChatGPT to abuse harder depressants like Xanax.

At one point, a friend opened a chat window with the bot for advice on a possible “Xanax overdose emergency,” writing that Nelson had taken an astonishing 185 tabs of Xanax the night before, and was now struggling to even type on his own, per SFGate.

“You are in a life-threatening medical emergency. That dose is astronomically fatal — even a fraction of that could kill someone,” it wrote. Yet as the conversation went on, ChatGPT began walking its own answers back, interspersing medical advice with tips on how to reduce his tolerance so one Xanax would “f**k you up.”

Nelson survived that particular trip, which turned out to actually be the result of kratom mixed with Xanax, depressants which impact the central nervous system. Two weeks later, as Nelson was home for the summer, his mother would walk in on him fatally overdosing on his bed after taking a repeat cocktail of kratom and Xanax, this time with alcohol.

As cofounder of the AI regulatory watchdog the Transparency Coalition Rob Eleveld explained to SFGate, foundational AI models like ChatGPT are probably the last place you ever want to ask for medical advice.

“There is zero chance, zero chance, that the foundational models can ever be safe on this stuff,” Eleveld said. “I’m not talking about a 0.1 percent chance. I’m telling you it’s zero percent. Because what they sucked in there is everything on the internet. And everything on the internet is all sorts of completely false crap.”

OpenAI declined to comment on SFGate’s investigation, but a spokesperson told the publication that Sam Nelson’s death is a “heartbreaking situation, and our thoughts are with the family.”

            <h2>Chinese Fusion Reactor Achieves Plasma Density Previously Thought to Be Impossible</h2>
            <p><strong>Futurism | 2026-01-06</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://futurism.com/science-energy/china-fusion-artificial-sun">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Scientists at China’s Experimental Advanced Superconducting Tokamak (EAST) program rang in the new year with a stunning accomplishment: empirical evidence that they used the device to achieve nuclear plasma densities once thought to be beyond human capabilities.

On January 1, researchers at the Hefei Institutes of Physical Science at the Chinese Academy of Sciences published a wild new study in the journal Science Advances. In it, the team details the way they used EAST — which has memorably been dubbed China’s “artificial sun” — to achieve a plasma density far higher than previous limits.

Nuclear fusion is the process by which two atomic nuclei combine to form a single, heavier nucleus, resulting in a huge release of energy. Because of its potential to produce limitless clean energy, scientists the world over have sought ways to use nuclear fusion as a viable power source.

One difficulty, however, is that all atomic nuclei have a positive charge, meaning they’re naturally repulsed by each other — think two magnets with opposite poles. To give atomic nuclei enough kinetic energy to combine into one, scientists must heat the fuel into a super-dense plasma at about 150 million kelvin, or 27 million degrees Fahrenheit, the researchers explained in a press release.

But to reach a point where this brew can power itself — a sustainable fusion reaction — requires that gnarly plasma to stay hot, dense, and stable for long stretches of time. For years, it was understood that higher plasma densities would inevitably result in instability, collapsing the fuel before it could ignite, a threshold known as the Greenwald limit.

This new research seemingly flips all that on its head. As the EAST team explains, the method basically involves creating a high gas pressure environment in the reactor prior to plasma formation, which allows the plasma to interact with the reactor wall in a much less destructive way than it would otherwise. Scientists also manually pump extra energy into the plasma as it heats, allowing an even rise in density.

The result is a plasma that remains stable even as its internal density rises, resulting in fuel densities “far exceeding empirical limits.”

“The findings suggest a practical and scalable pathway for extending density limits in tokamaks and next generation burning plasma fusion devices,” said Ping Zhu, one of the study’s co-authors and a plasma physicist at the Huazhong University of Science and Technology.

While there are still plenty of breakthroughs left before humanity achieves practical power production with fusion, shattering the Greenwald represents a major item on the to-do list — and another notch on China’s lengthy green energy belt.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">A man is suing Tesla after half his family was killed when their Model X, which was running one of the automaker’s driving assistance features, veered across the road line and into a tractor-trailer — crushing his wife, two daughters, son-in-law, and family dog, according to a grim new lawsuit reported by The Independent.

The man, Nathan Blaine, is accusing Tesla and CEO Elon Musk of having “intentionally misrepresented the safety of their vehicles” and the driver assistance features, the outlet noted, and says that the misleading claims lulled him and his wife into a “false sense of security.”

“Based on representations the Blaines heard made by Musk and Tesla,” the complaint states, per The Independent, “[they] believed [it] was a safer driver than a human driver of convention[al] vehicles.”

The suit targets Tesla’s “Autosteer” feature, a punched-up version of cruise control that “detects lane markings, road edges, and the presence of vehicles and objects to intelligently keep your vehicle in its driving lane,” per Tesla. Though it’s in beta, the feature is available to Tesla owners for free, unlike the automaker’s more advanced Autopilot and Full Self-Driving modes — though the Blaines did pay for FSD. The suit also implicates Tesla’s other safety systems, such as its “lane departure warning” and “emergency lane departure avoidance” systems, arguing they “defectively failed.”

“Tesla’s done a lot of good things, in my calculation, but they did this inadequately,” family attorney Lynn Shumway told The Independent. “I think the technology is fantastic, but not the way Tesla is implementing it.”

According to Nathan’s complaint, his wife Jennifer Blaine, 46, was driving the the car to pick up their daughters Denali, 11, and Emily, 22, along with Emily’s husband Zachary Leavitt, 24, to meet up with himself and one of their surviving sons, Bronco, for a mountain backpacking trip. After stopping at Idaho Falls, the four members hit the road again and headed east on Idaho State Highway 33.

Later that night, just before 10 PM, the Model X suddenly swerved into the oncoming lane while driving through a “gentle southward curve,” the complaint said. The Tesla slammed into an oncoming semi truck hauling a load weighing 90,000 pounds. The front end was “crushed rearward,” the complaint said, “crushing all of the occupants.” All four family members, and their dog Peaches, died at the scene.

Autosteer was at fault for the accident, the suit alleges. Though it’s not as autonomous as Autopilot — and though it’s unclear if Autopilot was engaged at the time of the crash — the system should have kept the car in the lane as advertised.

“Disengagement of Autopilot should not reduce the effectiveness of safety features the vehicle is equipped with,” the suit says.

Most people, and probably even most Tesla owners, would probably have to consult a manual to explain the differences between Autosteer, Autopilot, and Full Self-Driving, all of which have names suggesting a high level of automation. Musk, who has promised every year for the past decade that completely autonomous driving is right around the corner, has often conflated their capabilities while making grand boasts about his driving tech, including frequently repeating the claim that Teslas can “drive themselves.”

That’s despite the fact that, technically and in practice, Teslas decidedly do not drive themselves, not even while using Full Self-Driving mode. On a scale of one through five, its driving software is only considered Level 2 based on a widely used standard set by the Society of Automotive Engineers, meaning the cars require constant human supervision. Waymo robotaxis, for comparison, are considered Level 4, needing no supervision as long as the car is limited to certain locations.

Musk’s spurious claims, and Tesla’s dubious naming schemes, have landed it in hot water with regulators. The National Transportation Safety Board skewered FSD’s branding as “misleading,” and the California DMV sued the automaker for false advertising for the same reason. The suit suggests that the Blaines are a victim of Musk and Tesla’s arguably deceptive marketing.

Jennifer and Nathan Blaine, it says, were “just two members of the public exposed to Tesla’s long-term advertising campaign designed to persuade the public that its vehicles were capable of driving themselves,” per The Independent.

            <p><strong>TechCrunch | 2026-01-06</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/06/how-world-cup-champion-mario-gotze-built-a-parallel-career-as-an-angel-investor/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Mario Götze will go down in soccer history as the player who scored the winning goal that made Germany the 2014 FIFA World Cup champion. But he is also an increasingly seasoned angel investor.

Companion M, Götze’s personal investment vehicle, now has a portfolio of more than 70 companies, two of which became unicorns in 2025 — Danish fintech Flatpay and German AI startup Parloa. But the athlete also learned some lessons along the way about vetting opportunities. “I only agree to invest if the startup and its founders check all the boxes,” he told TechCrunch.

The boxes can be quite subjective at the stage at which Götze invests — typically pre-seed and seed rounds, with ticket sizes between €25,000 and €50,000 ($29,000-$58,000). To address this, Götze says Companion M “focuses on specific areas where we have built profound network and expertise.” Surprisingly, sports isn’t one of those areas — at least not directly.

According to Götze, Companion M primarily focuses on B2B SaaS, software infrastructure, and cybersecurity, as well as health and biotech. While that’s not sports tech per se, health and biotech are a natural niche for an athlete interested in human performance and wellness — and who has the freedom to pursue unconventional opportunities in those fields.

In 2020, Götze made headlines for investing in German cannabis startup Sanity Group when most European institutional investors wouldn’t touch cannabis with a 10-foot pole. Since then, Germany has liberalized some aspects of its cannabis laws, creating tailwinds for the startup that claimed a 10% share of the German medical cannabis market in 2024.

With cannabis still forbidden for athletes in competition, Götze will have to wait to try the stuff himself: The 33-year-old is still playing professionally at the top league level with German club Eintracht Frankfurt. But rather than waiting for retirement, he is taking cues from American athlete-investors such as NBA champion Kevin Durant.

Götze is not the only active European soccer player who also invests in startups — for instance, Cristiano Ronaldo and Kylian Mbappé also do. But as the father of two young daughters, he has to balance his various commitments. “I have to schedule calls before or after practices and align meetings with weeks when I don’t have away games or play Champions League,” Götze wrote.

Götze isn’t doing it all himself, but he is not simply entrusting others with his money either. Instead, he created Companion M as a small team that supports him with angel investing, partnerships, and other tasks. “These are important for myself as a brand, particularly in the long term, after [my] active career,” he explained.

There is an undeniable branding aspect to these efforts. When Götze became Revolut’s first-ever brand ambassador for Germany, the fintech company cited his track record as an angel investor as an incentive. But while preparing for his post-soccer career, Götze has found what he describes as “another passion apart from sport.”

This passion may be less unexpected than it seems. While Götze and his brothers all became soccer players, their father Jürgen is a professor at the Department of Electrical Engineering and Information Technology of TU Dortmund University, and the family spent time in Houston, Texas, when Jürgen was visiting Rice University as a postdoctoral researcher.

Not coincidentally, Götze mostly invests in Europe and in the U.S., with past investments including Miami-based Arcee AI and Frankfurt-based Qualifyze. Several portfolio companies went on to raise significant amounts of follow-on funding, and he has already exited some, such as Berlin-based KoRo.

Exits give Götze capital to reinvest, but he’s also focused on long-term wealth consolidation. As a limited partner, Companion backed more than 20 venture capital firms on both sides of the Atlantic, including 20VC, Cherry Ventures, EQT Ventures, Planet A, Merantix, Visionaries Club, and World Fund.

Götze is still under contract with his club and is reportedly discussing an extension. But whenever he finally retires, these venture firms could count him as a peer. “After my career ends, I plan to focus on my investment activities,” he told Bloomberg. But even then, don’t expect him to publish his anti-portfolio of startups he passed on and that later became huge successes.

“There are plenty of new startups every year, and there will be some that you miss out on. But regretting past decisions leads to making uneducated or impulsive decisions in the future,” he told TechCrunch. Spoken like a true sportsman: dwelling on what you missed won’t help you score the next goal.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Threads is exploring games in chats, beginning with a basketball game. A spokesperson for Meta confirmed to TechCrunch that the company is internally prototyping the game and that it’s not available to the public.

The game was first spotted by reverse engineer Alessandro Paluzzi, who often finds unreleased features while they’re still under development. Paluzzi shared a screenshot of the basketball game, which appears to let users virtually shoot hoops by swiping their finger. The idea behind the game is likely to allow friends to compete to see who can score the most baskets, similar to other mobile basketball games.

Launching in-message games would give Threads an edge over competitors like X and Bluesky, which don’t offer built-in games. It could also even help Threads compete with Apple’s Messages, which supports games via third-party apps like GamePigeon.

As with any internal prototype, it’s unknown when or if Meta plans to officially roll out games in Threads messages.

It’s also worth noting this isn’t the first time Meta has explored in-message gaming, as Instagram launched a hidden emoji game in DMs last year. The goal of the game is to use your finger to move the paddle at the bottom of the screen to keep an emoji of your choice afloat and continuously bouncing. If you let the emoji fall, you lose. The idea is to compete with the other person in the chat to achieve the highest score.

The internal prototype comes as Meta continues to build out Threads with new features to take on its competitors. For example, the platform recently expanded its Communities feature with more topics, likely aiming to draw users away from Reddit and X. Plus, it added a “disappearing posts” feature that lets users share their thoughts and engage in conversations that are automatically archived after 24 hours.

While Threads boasts 400 million monthly users, it still has quite a way to go to catch up with X in the U.S., according to data from Pew Research Center’s report released a few weeks ago. The report says 21% of U.S. adults said they have used X, compared with only 8% who have used Threads, and 4% who have used Bluesky.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Commonwealth Fusion Systems (CFS) said on Tuesday at CES 2026 that it had installed the first magnet in its Sparc fusion reactor, the demonstration device that it hopes to turn on next year.

The magnet is the first of 18 that, when the reactor is complete, will create a doughnut-like shape that will produce a powerful magnetic field to confine and compress superheated plasma. If all goes well, that plasma will release more energy than it takes to heat and compress it.

After decades of promise and delay, fusion power appears to be just around the corner — CFS and its competitors are locked in a race to deliver the first electrons to the grid sometime in the early 2030s. If it pans out, fusion power could unlock nearly limitless clean energy in a package that resembles a traditional power plant.

Key components of Sparc’s magnets have been completed, and the company expects to install all 18 by the end of the summer, said Bob Mumgaard, CFS’ co-founder and CEO. “It’ll go bang, bang, bang throughout the first half of this year as we put together this revolutionary technology.”

When installed, the D-shaped magnets will sit upright on a 24-foot wide, 75-ton stainless steel circle known as a cryostat, which was set in place last March. The magnets themselves weigh about 24 tons each and can generate a 20 tesla magnetic field, about 13 times stronger than a typical MRI machine. “It’s the type of magnet that you could use to, like, lift an aircraft carrier,” Mumgaard said.

To hit that strength, the magnets will be cooled to -253˚ C (-423˚ F) so they can safely conduct over 30,000 amps of current. Inside the doughnut, plasma will be burning at more than 100 million degrees C.

To work out as many kinks as possible before Sparc is turned on, CFS said on Tuesday that it is working with Nvidia and Siemens to develop a digital twin of the reactor. Siemens is supplying the design and manufacturing software, which will help the company collect data to feed it into Nvidia’s Omniverse libraries.

That won’t be CFS’ first simulation — the company has already been running numerous simulations to predict the performance of various parts of the reactor — but the existing efforts provide results in isolation, Mumgaard said. With the digital twin, he said, “these are no longer isolated simulations that are just used for design. They’ll be alongside the physical thing the whole way through, and we’ll be constantly comparing them to each other.”

The hope is that CFS can run experiments or tweak parameters in the digital twin before applying them to Sparc itself. “It will run alongside so we can learn from the machine even faster,” he said.

Building Sparc has been a costly endeavor. CFS has raised nearly $3 billion to date, including an $863 million Series B2 round in August that included investments from Nvidia, Google, and nearly three dozen other investors. The company’s first commercial-scale power plant, Arc, will be the first of its kind. As a result, it will likely cost another several billion dollars, CFS estimates.

Mumgaard hopes that digital twins and AI technology will help the company deliver fusion power to the grid sooner than later. “As the machine learning tools get better, as the representations get more precise, we can see it go even faster, which is good because we have an urgency for fusion to get to the grid,” he said.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Meta is pausing its plans to sell its Ray-Ban Display glasses outside the U.S. due to “unprecedented demand and limited supply,” the company said on Tuesday. Meta had originally planned to launch the glasses in France, Italy, Canada, and the U.K. in early 2026.

“Since launching last fall, we’ve seen an overwhelming amount of interest, and as a result, product waitlists now extend well into 2026,” the company said. “Because of this unprecedented demand and limited inventory, we’ve decided to pause our planned international expansion.”

Meta says it will continue focusing on fulfilling U.S. orders while it re-evaluates its approach to international availability.

Unveiled in September, the Meta Ray-Ban Display smart glasses are controlled by a wristband called the Meta Neural Band, which detects subtle hand gestures.

At CES this week in Las Vegas, Meta showed off new features coming to the glasses and the Neural Band. The glasses are getting a new teleprompter feature that gives users a portable way to deliver prepared remarks. Plus, users can now jot down messages using their finger on any surface while wearing Meta Neural Band and have those movements transcribed into digital messages.

Meta is also expanding pedestrian navigation to Denver, Las Vegas, Portland, and Salt Lake City.

            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/06/amazons-ring-doorbells-get-fire-alerts-an-app-store-and-new-sensors/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Amazon’s augmenting its Ring smart doorbells with new features, including new fire alerts, an app store, and a new set of Ring Sensors.

Announced at CES 2026 in Las Vegas, the company said the new Ring Sensors can detect motion, openings, glass breakage, and smoke, and can also monitor carbon monoxide levels, leaks, temperature changes, and air quality. They also let you control lighting and appliances that are connected to your smart home network.

Amazon is also adding a new app store to the Ring app to allow users to use its cameras with third-party apps. The store is currently available in the U.S. only, and users will be able to browse a selection of apps in the coming weeks. While the company didn’t specify what kind of apps the store would feature, it said these apps would focus on small business operations and everyday needs around the house.

And as fires grow more common in drought-affected areas, the company has teamed up with the fire monitoring app Watch Duty to show real-time updates and early warnings in the Ring app’s Neighbors section. Users can also share live updates to this section using their Ring cameras.

Notably, the new devices being launched support Amazon’s Sidewalk shared network feature, which creates a mesh network between the company’s Echo and Ring devices by sharing a small portion of your bandwidth, enabling devices to work even when they aren’t in wireless range of your Wi-Fi router.

Amazon is also adding a new AI-based feature to Ring cameras that learns the everyday patterns of a property and alerts users if anything unusual occurs. Dubbed “AI Unusual Event Alerts,” the company said the feature enables the Ring camera to surface specific warnings when it detects a person, based on location, actions, and clothing.

For people who subscribe to Amazon’s Virtual Security Guard services, these warnings could trigger intervention automatically. In the last month, the company has rolled out features that use video recognition to trigger Alexa responses and send you personalized notifications based on a database of 50 faces.

The company has also launched a new Ring Car Alarm with in-built GPS for vehicle monitoring.

            <div id="article-text">Robot vacuum maker Narwal unveiled its new set of smart vacuum cleaners at the Consumer Electronics Show with AI-powered features such as monitoring pets, finding valuable objects, and notifying users about misplaced toys.

The company said that its new flagship Flow 2 robot vacuum has a rounded design and easy-lift tanks for better cleaning. The device uses two 1080p RGB cameras with a 136-degree field of view to map out the area and recognize different kinds of objects using AI models.

Narwal said that through this tech stack, the vacuum cleaner has the ability to identify an unlimited number of objects. The device first tries to identify an object locally, but in case there are no matches, it sends the data to the cloud for further processing.

The Flow 2 has three key modes called pet care mode, baby care mode, and AI floor tag mode. With pet care mode, you can define zones where pets usually rest or hang out to clean themselves. Plus, it can monitor pets and also check in on your pets via two-way audio (there is no guarantee they will listen to you, though). In the baby care mode, the vacuum switches to quiet mode near the crib and notifies you of misplaced toys. In the AI floor tag mode, the vacuum recognizes valuable items like jewelry, avoids them, and alerts you.

Narwal said that its newest vacuum cleaner has four cleaning modes that can identify different types of dirt. The device can also return to its base to wash the mop and then re-mop a certain area if it is dirty. The company noted that the Flow 2’s design allows for a higher hot water washing temperature for better cleaning.

Along with the Flow 2, the company also showed off a handheld vacuum called the U50 that weighs 1.41 kg (3.1 lbs) and has UV-C sterilization along with heat treatment for allergen removal. The company also demoed an unnamed cordless vacuum with a slim design, 360-degree swivel, and up to 50 minutes of run time. The cordless vacuum also has an auto-empty station that can support up to 60 days of dust disposal.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Nicolás Maduro wasn’t due to arrive at his arraignment yesterday in downtown Manhattan until noon, but a large crowd had already formed outside the federal courthouse by 9 a.m. Actually, two crowds. One had come to tell Donald Trump to keep his hands off Venezuela. The other, which seemed largely Venezuelan, had come to celebrate.

Maduro was, until Saturday, a widely hated ruler. His last election campaign consisted of threatening his people with a “bloodbath” if he lost. (Even so, he lost, but he claimed victory anyway.) The two crowds outside the courthouse mirrored the split reaction following Maduro’s capture by the United States. For many international observers, his ouster was cause for alarm—a sign that a U.S. president can drop bombs abroad and kidnap a foreign leader without a declaration of war or congressional approval. But for so many Venezuelans, the sight of Maduro in shackles was about a tyrant facing justice.

Before the hearing began, the hallway outside the courtroom was packed with people hoping to get a seat. Some were law students who had come because they sensed that a legal precedent was being set, though not necessarily a good one. The way Maduro was captured “puts the system of international law in danger,” Leo Enderle, a German student at NYU, told me. Another group of people had come for the sheer spectacle. The man standing in front of me said he had attended the arraignments of Sean Combs and Donald Trump in the same building; according to him, this crowd was just as big. When I arrived, he was outraged that a Venezuelan man had cut in line to join a friend. The Venezuelan explained that he had been a political prisoner for years and had dreamed of this moment. Just because you were a political prisoner, the man in front of me was lamenting, doesn’t mean you get to cut the line.

But by far the largest group of attendees I spoke with were Venezuelans who wanted to see Maduro punished. The last time I had stood in line with so many Venezuelans angry at Maduro was in 2013, when I still lived in the country, in one of the infamous breadlines that resulted from rationing. Then, like now, people were very talkative. At the courthouse, an elegantly dressed woman from Caracas told me she had left her newborn granddaughter at home with a nanny. “This historical moment, I couldn’t miss it!”

David Cardenas, a Venezuelan opposition activist, told me that Maduro had singled him out on TV one day, threatening to send police to his house and jail him as part of “Operation Knock-Knock.” Soon after, Cardenas, who lives in the United States, posted a video saying Maduro would be the target of Operation Trump-Trump. “I guess Trump-Trump came before Knock-Knock,” Cardenas told me with a smile.

Elsewhere in line, a young woman I’ll call Maria had come to the courthouse with her mother, who was visiting from Venezuela for the holidays. (She asked me to withhold her name for privacy concerns.) Maria told me that nobody she knew in America could understand why she was excited to see Maduro arrested: “My friends are like, ‘This is imperialism!’ and ‘So sorry Trump did this to your country!’” When one of her housemates told her they were thinking of going to protest Maduro’s capture, Maria responded that not every prisoner deserves sympathy.

After we were seated in the courtroom, Maduro walked in, escorted by guards. Instead of his usual button-down, he wore a navy-blue T-shirt, with an orange one peeking out from underneath. Maduro scanned the audience as though he were looking for a friendly face, but he didn’t seem to find one. “Buenos días,” he said to no one in particular, and sat down.

“Are you Nicolás Maduro Moros?” the judge asked.

Maduro responded in Spanish, as he would throughout the hearing. “I am Nicolás Maduro Moros, the constitutional president of Venezuela,” he said, and went on to explain that he’d been kidnapped by the United States. He called himself a “prisoner of war.” Visibly impatient, the judge suggested that Maduro should respond with a simple yes or no. “Are you Nicolás Maduro Moros?” the judge asked again. “I am Nicolás Maduro Moros,” he responded.

The judge then read the charges aloud: narco-terrorism conspiracy, cocaine-importation conspiracy, and two others related to weapons. Maduro pleaded not guilty, adding, “I’m a decent man and still the president of Venezuela.” Once again, the judge told Maduro to keep his answers succinct, before addressing Maduro’s wife, Cilia Flores, who was sitting nearby wearing the same outfit.

The judge told Maduro that, as a foreigner facing trial in the United States, he had the right to consulate resources. But Maduro himself had effectively closed Venezuela’s consulates when he recalled the country’s diplomats from the United States in 2019, leaving more than half a million people without representation. It’s unclear, then, exactly what resources Maduro will have access to.

As the hearing finished and Maduro stood to leave, spectators jeered at him in Spanish, a liberty that—had they taken it in Venezuela just last week—would probably have landed them in prison, or worse. “Have fun in jail,” one said. “On behalf of all Venezuelans, you will pay,” shouted another. One woman was even more blunt: “Damn you.”</div>

            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-01-06</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/2026/02/slavery-resistance-history-carrie-gibson-sudhir-hazareesingh/685429/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">In 1812, Spanish officials in Havana, searching the house of a man named José Antonio Aponte, discovered a wooden box hidden in a clothing trunk, opened it, and were stunned by what they found inside. “It was unlike any book they had ever seen,” Carrie Gibson writes in The Great Resistance: The 400-Year Fight to End Slavery in the Americas, “filled with Biblical and historical images, with many black faces, as well as cut-out bits of paper and handwritten words.” Aponte, a freeman who had once served in the local militia, was part of a group that had sought to launch an uprising among the enslaved. The goal was to overthrow slavery and make Cuba independent, but the rebellion had been quickly suppressed.

Put on trial, Aponte was questioned for three days about what his interrogators called his “book of paintings.” In Daring to Be Free: Rebellion and Resistance of the Enslaved in the Atlantic World, Sudhir Hazareesingh emphasizes the global sweep of Aponte’s portraits, among them versions of Abyssinian royalty and, as Gibson notes, the Greek philosopher Diogenes the Cynic, believed to have once been a slave himself. One element particularly alarmed the Spanish: scenes of Black soldiers vanquishing white troops, evoking the victories of Haitian revolutionaries against the French a decade earlier. During meetings at his house, Aponte had shown them to fellow insurrectionists as proof that they, too, could win a war against slavery.

When he was asked to explain why he had chosen to include what he did, his answer was simple: “For reasons of history.” Aponte was executed after his trial, and his book disappeared. All that is left are Aponte’s descriptions of the work, page by page, at his trial. But that testimony has allowed contemporary historians and artists to reconstruct his visionary awareness that, in seeking to change his world, he first had to compile his own history of what had come before.

In their ambitious histories of slave resistance, Gibson and Hazareesingh are working in the tradition of Aponte, offering a new intellectual and political perspective on the emergence of freedom in the modern world. A generation ago, foundational works on the history of antislavery movements tended to focus on political thinkers and prominent abolitionists, figures who left ample written records behind. But over the past several decades, scholars have made headway in piecing together the ideas and actions of resistance leaders such as Aponte, as well as of the enslaved themselves. This is challenging work: The system of slavery frequently barred access to literacy, and most accounts of enslaved resistance come from people who were not just hostile to the venture but actively seeking to suppress it. By gathering second- and thirdhand traces and elusive sources and data, historians have illuminated communities in the forests of the Kongo region, the deltas of West Africa, the mangroves of Cuba, and the swamps of the Carolinas.

From the November 2025 issue: The Black loyalists of the American Revolution

The Great Resistance and Daring to Be Free synthesize this growing body of scholarship to offer detailed accounts that stretch from the 15th century, when enslaved people from West Africa were first imported to Iberia, through the abolition of slavery in the United States, Cuba, and Brazil in the late 19th century. Gibson builds on her own earlier wide-ranging history of the Caribbean, Empire’s Crossroads (2014), and Hazareesingh branches out from Black Spartacus (2020), his biography of Toussaint Louverture, a leader of the Haitian Revolution.

The story of resistance begins in Africa, where the slave trade itself originates. There, Hazareesingh argues, lie the foundations of a long and influential tradition of antislavery activity that continued into resistance efforts throughout the Americas. He assembles evidence of what he calls an “African fugitive politics”: people on the continent threatened by enslavement taking concerted action in collective ways, intent on self-determination. In many different regions, groups seeking sanctuary from raids by slavers created new settlements during the 17th and 18th centuries. Many of them exist to this day, their founding histories preserved and celebrated in oral traditions.

The Tofinu took refuge in the lagoons along the Bight of Benin, a core area of the slave trade, venturing forth in canoes with harpoons, javelins, and swords to fight off raiders from powerful nearby kingdoms. In present-day central Nigeria, the Eggon created fortified positions in the hills from which they launched stones, spears, and even beehives against would-be enslavers. The focus on living in freedom nurtured a nonhierarchical approach to politics, Hazareesingh writes, and he describes an ethos rooted in honor and consensus. Settlements were named to convey their fugitive origins. “Here where no one can reach them anymore,” one was called; another was “the village of free people.”

Millions couldn’t escape the raiders on the continent. But the remarkable SlaveVoyages database—which both Gibson and Hazareesingh draw on—has transformed our knowledge of resistance at sea. An open-access digital project, it has documented the scale of the slave trade originating on the continent, compiling data on roughly 35,000 voyages that carried at least 10 million people across the Atlantic from Africa. It has also found references to 465 shipboard revolts. Using the database, one study suggests that open resistance may have occurred in as many as 10 percent of slave voyages. The majority of the revolts date back to well before Joseph Cinqué’s carefully plotted rebellion on the Amistad in 1839, the most famous of them and one of a small number that succeeded in securing freedom for those aboard.

Historians are also indebted to written documents left behind by Islamic and Catholic thinkers in Africa who developed religious critiques of slavery. Both Gibson and Hazareesingh single out a Kongolese man named Lourenço da Silva Mendonça, who in the 17th century articulated a particularly powerful attack. He was born into the Ndongo royal lineage in the Kingdom of Kongo, where many had adopted Catholicism. In 1671, he and his family were forced out of the kingdom by the Portuguese and sent to the colony of Brazil. Having seen the ravages of slave-raiding in his homeland, he now witnessed the system of slavery into which many of his people had been sold. He then traveled to Portugal and took up residence in a monastery where several others from the Kongo, as well as Indigenous Brazilians, lived and studied.

Convinced that slavery went against the teachings of Catholicism, he wrote a brief denouncing the institution, which he brought to the Vatican in 1684. “Humanity is infused with the spirit of God,” he argued, and racial differences, an “accident of nature,” are in no way grounds for enslavement. As he pressed his case at the Vatican, Mendonça gathered a dossier that included firsthand accounts from Africans in Portugal.

Along with his own experiences, that evidence fueled his eloquent denunciation of “the unjustified methods used to enslave” people in Africa, “from which results the loss of countless Souls,” as well as the “cruelties” practiced against the enslaved in the Americas. Torture with hot wax and tree sap appalled Mendonça; some of the torments, he observed, were worse than those visited on the early Christian martyrs, and all the more shocking because they were meted out by Christians against other Christians. Mendonça also advocated on behalf of the “New Christians,” among them Jews who had converted to Catholicism but were often still pursued by the Inquisition.

Pope Innocent XI responded by calling on Spain and Portugal to at least curtail the cruelty of slavery. But the profitable slave trade continued, crucial to the colonial order that the leaders of these and other European kingdoms had decided to build. Mendonça’s singular legal case lay buried in the Vatican archives for centuries. Now recovered, his story is an example of the constant cross-Atlantic transmission of information and ideas that Gibson and Hazareesingh highlight as integral to the far-reaching struggle for abolition.

During his time in Brazil, Mendonça had contact with the residents of Palmares, a network of nine jointly governed maroon communities, many of whose members were formerly enslaved refugees from the Kongo. (In the 16th century, the Spanish used the term cimarrónes—originally applied to untamed animals—to describe people who escaped from plantations; other colonial powers adopted versions of it, including the English term maroon.) Probably the largest of all such settlements in the Americas, Palmares thrived through much of the 17th century, its population numbering as many as 10,000 or perhaps even 20,000 residents at one point, and it wielded clout on a different scale than smaller fugitive communities in Africa did.

Under a leader named Gana Zumba, Palmares signed a peace treaty with the Portuguese guaranteeing its freedom. It established alliances with Indigenous Brazilians in the area, and its inclusivity extended to people who weren’t enslaved but were fleeing colonial society, including Jews persecuted for their religious beliefs. African culture, language, and religious practices undergirded community life, but a Catholic priest performed baptisms in a church in Palmares adorned with statues of Jesus, the Virgin Mary, and Saint Blaise, an Armenian martyr whose story of taking refuge from persecution in the Cappadocian mountains resonated with the maroons.

Gibson recounts the trajectory of Palmares as just one part of a much longer history of people seeking freedom and sanctuary in the midst of colonial societies. In Spanish Santo Domingo, the first slave society in the Americas, Africans on a sugar plantation owned by Christopher Columbus’s son rebelled on Christmas Day 1521. They escaped into the hills and allied with an Indigenous group fleeing Spanish control, led by a man named Enriquillo. After 15 years, Spanish troops dispersed the settlement—which had grown to 4,000, and had its own cavalry—but subsequent maroon groups forced colonizers to sign treaties with them.

As the plantation colonies of the British and French Caribbean grew in the late 17th and 18th centuries, escapees formed maroon enclaves there as well. The region also saw a series of mass revolts against slavery. In the 1760s, enslaved organizers in Jamaica launched an uprising that was later known as Tacky’s Revolt. It was, as Gibson writes, “not a small, local eruption, easily snuffed out. Rather, this resistance was akin to a multisite, decentralized guerrilla war, not against a particular king or ruler, but against a social and economic system.”

And then in 1791, the largest such uprising in history took shape in the nearby French colony of Saint-Domingue. It led to the abolition of slavery by France in 1794 and, when Napoleon Bonaparte sought to reenslave the population, to Haiti’s independence from France on January 1, 1804, when the island was rechristened with the original Indigenous name for the territory. Hazareesingh and Gibson emphasize the revolution’s role in articulating a radical idea of universal rights and cultivating new forms of democratic participation. (As the notes in The Great Resistance and Daring to Be Free indicate, the close-knit field relies on scholarly interchange; both authors draw on my work on Haiti, and I gave Hazareesingh feedback, reading suggestions, and a blurb.)

The Haitian Revolution’s success in overthrowing slavery and then establishing a new nation gave rise to a very different archive, including writings by and about its most recognized leader, Louverture, and Haiti’s founder, Jean-Jacques Dessalines. These offer us a personal understanding of the influences that shaped their lives and ideas. Dessalines, for instance, acknowledged his deep debt to the woman he considered his “second mother,” Toya Montou, one of a number of women who participated directly in combat. She taught him about his African roots and during the revolution led her own unit of insurgents.

The dramatic victory in Haiti nourished the imaginations of enslaved people across the hemisphere, helping create what Hazareesingh describes as a “popular encyclopaedia” that was “embedded in songs, music, images, and artefacts, and stories, tales, and myths about the revolution’s heroic leaders and the achievements of the Haitian people.” Brazilian authorities were alarmed in 1805 when they found Black officers in the local militia wearing “miniature portraits of Dessalines around their necks.” Parishioners in Black churches in Philadelphia celebrated the anniversary of Haitian independence, if quietly. In Louisiana, a man named Charles Deslondes led a two-day revolt in 1811, the largest in U.S. history, and almost certainly inspired by the Haitian Revolution. Two decades later, Nat Turner planned his (ultimately thwarted) 1831 rebellion in Southampton County, Virginia, to begin on the 40th anniversary of the Haitian Revolution’s start.

From the August 1861 issue: Nat Turner’s Insurrection

The events of the Haitian Revolution reshaped the history of North America: Napoleon’s defeat there prompted him to sell Louisiana—which he had reacquired from Spain as part of his plan to build a French empire in the Americas—to the United States in 1803. The purchase doubled the country’s size, enabling the U.S. to become a bleak outlier: During the next decades, while slavery was being abolished in newly independent Latin American republics and in the British Caribbean, the U.S. expanded slavery into the recently acquired territory.

With the Louisiana Purchase, a huge domestic slave trade got under way, supplying labor to cotton and sugar plantations. Though only roughly 5 percent of the total number of enslaved Africans brought to the New World from the 16th century through the start of the 19th ended up in North America, by the time of the Civil War, the enslaved population had grown to approximately 4 million, mostly native-born. All of their efforts at rebellion in the 19th century were swiftly and brutally suppressed.

Still, other powerful forms of resistance surfaced. Escapes to the North were organized by figures such as Harriet Tubman. Some who had won their freedom, among them Frederick Douglass, wrote powerful autobiographies that were also devastating critiques of slavery. And abolitionist materials produced in the North traveled south. A Mississippi plantation manager complained in 1847 about an enslaved woman named California who had “an idea that she is free” and was passing that idea on to her children. In an echo of Aponte, she had decorated the walls of her cabin with antislavery prints, which were often circulated along with pamphlets.

From the December 1866 issue: Frederick Douglass’s ‘Reconstruction’

When the Civil War began, as many as 500,000 enslaved men and women escaped toward Union lines. After the Emancipation Proclamation, the involvement of 200,000 Black soldiers in the war proved crucial in the Union victory. Some African American recruiters invoked the earlier history of the Haitian Revolution in their pitch, recalling how Black troops in Haiti had secured and protected abolition: Like those forebears, new “black Toussaints” could strike “blow after blow for freedom,” and bring liberation to all of those still enslaved in the South.

As Aponte knew, the way you look at the past shapes your hopes about the present and future. In the U.S., debates about how to understand our experience of slavery and its ultimate demise are as intense as ever, and will continue to be at the core of broader questions about how to narrate our national story. But Hazareesingh and Gibson invite us to see ourselves as inheritors of something much broader too: a powerful history of political thought and on-the-ground resistance—in many forms, always against seemingly insurmountable odds—that stretched across continents and centuries.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Gavin Newsom has a 30-page file of reasons the Democrats lost the 2024 presidential election. Bounding across his Sacramento office, he starts listing them: incumbency, inflation, interest rates, Israel—and that’s just the letter I. “Yes, too woke,” he adds. “Yes, 107 days,” referring to the short campaign after Joe Biden’s forced withdrawal. But the California governor distills his party’s problem down to one word. Weak.

Newsom slaps his hand on a marked-up hardback of Bill Clinton’s memoir, brought down from the shelf a minute earlier. “Given the choice,” he tells me, summing up a crucial Clinton insight—one many Democrats still can’t quite seem to grasp—“the American people always support strong and wrong versus weak and right.”

According to prediction markets and early polling, Newsom is the Democrats’ current front-runner for 2028. He is also one of the most visible anti-Trump forces in America. His idea of strength includes a willingness to fight dirty, going lower than Barack Obama could ever imagine, and so his social-media accounts bristle with memes about Donald Trump’s bruised hand and advancing age. “Donald has fallen asleep in his own Cabinet meeting,” he recently asserted on X. Some posts are downright cruel, such as the one about Elon Musk’s estrangement from his transgender child: “We’re sorry your daughter hates you, Elon,” it said.

He also has a high tolerance for risk. Proposition 50, a ballot measure that has redrawn California’s congressional map in favor of the Democrats, was seen as a toss-up when he first backed it last year. The new map was a blatant partisan gerrymander, a departure from the time when the Democrats used to talk up the fairness of independent commissions. Morally wrong, maybe—but do you want to win back the House or not? Prop 50 passed by a two-to-one margin.

Newsom, who is 58, has a memoir coming out next month. This is a traditional rite of passage for people running for president, which he is, even though we are supposed to pretend that he hasn’t decided yet. He has some obvious advantages over the likely competition. As a heterosexual white man from a Catholic background, nothing about his identity is electorally risky. He is tall—6 foot 3—and good-looking in a faintly sinister way: You can imagine him being played by Matthew McConaughey or the vampire dad from Twilight. In a political arena now dominated by podcasts, he can talk until he’s hoarse; as San Francisco mayor, he once uploaded a multipart “State of the City” address to YouTube that lasted more than seven hours.

As for his liabilities, well, the word smarm comes up a lot: The teeth are too white, the hair perfectly gelled. As if to compensate for his overuse of buzzwords—he told me he was “concerned about the significant expansion in the health-care space from a sustainability perspective”—man and brother are strategically deployed to seem folksy. In person, he is enormously charismatic, and is obviously performing. “He is a good communicator,” the Bay Area political strategist Alex Clemens told me. “He tries very hard to be a good communicator, and some people latch on to the trying-hard, instead of the end result.”

Newsom’s core views are also hard to ascertain. Right now, Democrats are divided into multiple camps: the can-do Abundance crew; centrists, who warn about the overreach of “The Groups,” such as the ACLU; Resistance libs, often dismissively referred to as the “wine mom” tendency; and left-wing populists, who think the party should not yield an inch on social issues, but instead focus on bashing billionaires. Newsom is trying to offer something to all four factions. His mentor, former San Francisco Mayor Willie Brown, said last year that his protégé is a “movie star” capable of being elected president—but also that he has never asked Newsom what he believes, “for fear he doesn’t know!”

Read: The week that changed everything for Gavin Newsom

Newsom’s campaign tactics are similarly fluid. At the start of Trump’s second term, the governor offered him an “open hand, not a closed fist,” before casting himself as the leader of the Resistance. He attributes this change to the deployment of the National Guard to his state. “I was shaped by a different consciousness and understanding of our politics,” he told me.

And there’s another problem: California. Newsom was born and bred in a state widely associated with moonbeams, metrosexuality, and macrobiotics. He has never faced a serious challenge from the right, and has instead spent a career among left-wing interest groups whose stances on immigration, drugs, gender, and climate change seem far-out to Middle America. “If you want to see the socialist Biden/Harris future for our country, just take a look at California,” one speaker at the 2020 Republican National Convention said, with the cadences of a carnival barker warning about the apocalypse. “It is a place of immense wealth, immeasurable innovation, and immaculate environment, and the Democrats turned it into a land of discarded heroin needles in parks, riots in streets, and blackouts in homes.”

Who was that speaker? Kimberly Guilfoyle, otherwise known as Gavin Newsom’s ex-wife. Many California Democrats—and even some of Newsom’s friends—still cannot understand why he ever married Guilfoyle, who went on to have an open-casket MAGA makeover and was engaged for a time to Donald Trump Jr.

All of this brings us to the defining question: Who is Gavin Newsom, really, underneath the charm—and the smarm?

Authors write a memoir when there’s something about themselves that they want other people to understand. So what don’t outsiders get about Gavin Newsom?

“The memoir opens up with that question,” Newsom tells me—the question of whether “I’ve become a caricature of myself and contributed to it, as it relates to this perception of privilege and wealth that has dogged me—and at times infuriated, not just frustrated, me.” I run the caricature as I understand it past him: His father was a friend of the Gettys, one of San Francisco’s wealthiest and most well-connected families, and Newsom started his first business with Getty money. “Yeah, you got it, sums it up,” he says. So how is it wrong? “Well, you gotta read the book,” he deadpans.

Newsom’s version is that he grew up between two worlds. His parents divorced when he was still a young child. His late father, Bill, was close to the oil heirs Gordon Getty and John Paul Getty Jr.—so close, in fact, that Bill became an administrator of the Getty family trust and helped deliver the ransom for the kidnapped John Paul Getty III. With the Gettys, Gavin went on safari and watched polar bears in Canada. But at home with his mother, Tessa, life was Wonder bread and mac and cheese.

At his high school in Marin County, north of San Francisco, Newsom was not a great student, but he was a talented first baseman, and he has attributed his acceptance at Santa Clara University to the fact he was “left-handed and could throw a baseball a little bit.” At times, an exaggerated version of his college record has spread, giving the incorrect impression that he played for Santa Clara and was drafted by the Texas Rangers. (A spokesperson has previously said, “He is doing his job, and he cannot spend his entire day correcting people when they make errors about him.”)

Playing baseball “helped me build confidence, got me out of my shell, and so I have deep reverence—I value sports and athletics, and also competition,” Newsom tells me. One of his two podcasts, Politickin’, is co-hosted by the former NFL star Marshawn Lynch—the legendary “Beast Mode”—and the sports agent Doug Hendrickson. The show is raucous, fratty, and frequently profane; in one episode, Lynch told their guest, Jimmy Kimmel, that “you gotta let your nuts hang.” As Kimmel observed: “This has to be the weirdest podcast ever, right?” (Newsom paused Politickin’ during the Palisades Fire crisis, but plans to revive it later this year.)

After college, the young Gavin and his childhood friend Billy Getty founded a wine store called PlumpJack, which has since grown into a restaurant-and-vineyard empire. (The word is a nickname for Shakespeare’s Falstaff, and the title of an opera by Gordon Getty.) “I grew a business with a relatively modest investment from a few members of the Getty family,” Newsom says now. “There were 13 investors.” Then he adds: “I’m not naive as well; I don’t run away from a recognition of the advantages and the privileges that I did enjoy.”

These connections have led to many of Newsom’s unflattering nicknames over the years, such as “Prince Gavin.” “Everybody thinks of Gavin and a silver spoon,” Nancy Pelosi told me. “But that isn’t right.” The former House speaker is a strong supporter of Newsom and recently helped him fundraise for Prop 50. There is even a persistent MAGA folk myth that she is his aunt: In fact, Newsom’s aunt Barbara was once married to Pelosi’s brother-in-law Ron. Pelosi, who has known Newsom since birth, added, “He was a very hard worker in everything that he did, whether it was personally, professionally, and then civically.”

One source of lifelong struggle is his dyslexia. He is an obsessive note taker, a habit born of the condition. He reads a book or a briefing agonizingly slowly, then copies out the best points onto a notepad, before transferring them to yellow index cards. Because of this, he prefers to rely on interrogating nearby people or memorizing information. In the 2000s, this tendency led his staff to nickname him Rain Man. “If you notice, when he speaks, he’s never reading from notes,” Senator Alex Padilla of California, who ran Newsom’s first campaign for lieutenant governor, told me. “So he, in some ways, overcompensates through preparation.”

As a result, Newsom can rattle off talking points with disorienting velocity. When I challenged him on his record as California governor, he machine-gunned me with a list of achievements: “$11 billion to reform the Medicaid system, the most significant reforms to Medicaid in the country; taking our whole-person care pilots and bringing them statewide; getting an 1115 waiver, getting a 1332 waiver from the Feds, all hard work; CalRx, not subsidizing costs, lowering costs—$11 insulin as a proof point of that. You can look down a list: $25 minimum wage for health-care workers, $20 for fast-food workers, no other state in the country, hard-fought battles; 800,000 gig workers now can organize, that was a six-year effort . . .”

I checked these numbers afterward, and although some of the claimed policy triumphs were either arguable or still pending, he was word-perfect on the figures. No wonder he’s desperate to appear on Joe Rogan’s podcast, I thought. He would beast-mode Rogan with a swarm of facts.

Newsom has always, always wanted to be president. In the late ’90s, his Balboa Cafe, in San Francisco’s Cow Hollow neighborhood, was a place where old and new money mixed. “Though barely out of his 20s, he already has a repertoire of politician’s gestures—placing his arm conspiratorily on a listener’s shoulder, punching the air to make a point,” The New York Times reported in 1998.

His childhood friend Lori Puccinelli Stern once organized a charity auction at Planet Hollywood with future Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger. They sold off a cigar-smoking-and-chess session with the Terminator star and a date with Newsom, then one of the most eligible bachelors in town. The winners of the latter prize were an older couple in real estate, which surprised the hosts. “We were thinking maybe a young girl who had eyes for Gavin would want this,” Puccinelli Stern told me. “The couple said, ‘We want to have dinner with him and our children, because we want them to get to know someone who we think is probably going to be the president of the United States someday.’” Stern said she wanted to talk to me because too many people saw Newsom as a “cyborg politician” when he was funny and loyal, the kind of guy who, “if you’re stuck in a Turkish prison, mistakenly, he’s your phone call.”

Another close friend, the event impresario Stanlee Gatti, remembers talking with Newsom in the 1990s, when Willie Brown had just appointed his friend to the San Francisco parking commission. Newsom stopped by Gatti’s studio and saw him casting the I Ching, a traditional Chinese method of divination that uses coins or yarrow stalks. Newsom wanted to try it. “The I Ching said, If you’re thinking about running for political, public office—don’t,” Gatti told me. “It said, You are an artist and you are a creator, and you should be doing something that uses that part.”

In Gatti’s telling, Newsom didn’t demur. “I can see it so clearly, right now, him standing up there, and he goes: Okay, that’s it. I guess I’m not running for office.” But Gatti didn’t believe his friend. (I asked Gatti if he would cast the I Ching again, to predict his friend’s future once more. “I need him to throw it,” he said, mulling the idea. If Newsom was willing, Gatti said, “we can do it over the phone.” As I waited, he texted the governor. An answer pinged back in less than a minute: “Too risky.”)

Family connections quickly propelled him upward in local government. Bill Newsom once told San Francisco Weekly that a friend of his helped engineer his son’s appointment to the city’s Board of Supervisors. “Besides,” Newsom’s father said, “they needed a straight white male on the board.”

When he ran for San Francisco mayor, Newsom’s platform was moderate and pro-business, in the model of Senator Dianne Feinstein. His signature policy was “care not cash,” a program to divert welfare spending to housing for the homeless, which he touted as a compassionate answer to Rudy Giuliani’s broken-windows toughness. In the runoff, Newsom narrowly beat the Green candidate, Matt Gonzalez, who became a public defender. “I think it was a closer race than he would have hoped for,” said Padilla, who first met Newsom around this time.

But within two months of taking office, he made a huge gamble: He started issuing marriage licenses to same-sex couples—effectively daring the state to strike them down. In hindsight, it’s easy to forget how provocative this was. Democrats believed that gay marriage was a losing issue, and that Newsom’s actions risked a conservative backlash for little practical gain.

Kate Kendell, then the executive director of the National Center for Lesbian Rights, remembers getting a phone call from the mayor’s office on a Friday afternoon saying it planned to start issuing licenses the following Monday. She was wary. “Things felt very perilous and tenuous, and it felt like a firecracker moment,” she told me. When Newsom’s office said it would go ahead anyway, Kendell called the lesbian activists Phyllis Lyon and Del Martin, partners of more than 50 years. She asked if the couple, who were then 79 and 83, wanted to be the first to get a license.

Newsom decided at the last minute not to conduct the ceremony himself—“He felt like it would be too much about him,” Kendell said—and so County Assessor Mabel Teng married the couple, who had arrived in matching pantsuits, turquoise and purple. Newsom gave them a copy of the California constitution as a wedding gift. “It was pretty extraordinary,” Kendell said, “but he paid holy hell for it. He got angry calls from Dianne Feinstein. He got angry calls from Barney Frank”—an openly gay congressman—“that the Democratic establishment was not happy with him.”

Newsom believes that he was not invited to speak at the 2004 Democratic National Convention because of the backlash. When John Kerry lost the White House that year, some Democrats blamed Newsom. “I believe it did energize a very conservative vote,” Feinstein said at the time. It was “too much, too fast, too soon.”

The young politician didn’t fold, but he did brood. “I mean, come on, maybe Democrats shouldn’t have supported civil rights in the ’60s,” he told a public-radio station immediately after the election. The party, and the country, has since validated his gamble. In 2008, the California Supreme Court voted to allow gay marriages—for a brief window, before a ballot measure overturned the ruling. The second time round, Newsom personally married Phyllis and Del at city hall. “Del was much more frail now, but they wore the same pantsuits . . . It was a huge celebratory spectacle,” Kendell told me, adding: “I think public opinion had really started to shift.”

In 2015, the U.S. Supreme Court legalized gay marriage across the country. “I know change for many of our LGBT brothers and sisters must have seemed so slow for so long,” said President Obama, welcoming the ruling. “But compared to so many other issues, America’s shift has been so quick.”

For Newsom, the fallout from the gay weddings was nothing compared with the implosion of his first marriage. Newsom had married Guilfoyle, an assistant district attorney turned television host, in 2001. Her “something borrowed” was one of Ann Getty’s tiaras, and the reception for their 600 guests was held at the Getty mansion.

The marriage was short and tempestuous. Guilfoyle’s television career in New York pulled her away from the West Coast, and Newsom would spend Sunday evenings with Puccinelli Stern, her husband, and their new baby, watching Extreme Makeover: Home Edition and eating pizza. She told me he would turn up wearing a baseball cap, and when the lucky families saw their new home, he “would put his hat down so we didn’t see him getting emotional.”

Guilfoyle took a somewhat unorthodox approach to life as a political consort. Filling in for Newsom at a gay awards dinner, she told the crowd: “I know that many of you wanted to see my husband, and some of you had questions out there. Is he hot? Yeah. Is he hung? Yeah.” The couple infamously posed together, sprawled on a rug, for the September 2004 issue of Harper’s Bazaar, in a story headlined “The New Kennedys.” The rug, and surrounding house, belonged to Ann Getty, and the magazine’s fashion editor at the time was Jacqui Getty, who was then Ann’s daughter-in-law. Asked about Newsom’s ambitions, Guilfoyle replied: “Do I think he could be president of the United States? Absolutely. I’d gladly vote for him.”

Within months of the story’s publication, however, the couple announced their split. What followed was a dark time for Newsom: He was frequently seen with a glass in his hand at local restaurants, although a spokesperson maintained that he had no alcohol problems. The newly single 38-year-old “Mayor McHottie” had relationships with a Scientologist, a 19-year-old model, and—most damagingly—his former appointments secretary Ruby Rippey Gibney, who was married to one of his closest aides.

Days after coming clean about the last of these relationships, he announced that he would seek treatment because “I will be a better person without alcohol in my life.” For a decade, the media reported that he had been to rehab, but in 2018, The Sacramento Bee corrected this assumption. Newsom told the paper he had sought only counseling with a local therapist and later resumed drinking socially. More than one person I spoke with wondered whether Newsom had pleaded alcohol abuse at the time to avoid the charge of moral degeneracy. When the #MeToo movement brought the scandal back into the news, Rippey Gibney wrote on Facebook that she had not felt coerced into the relationship, as a “free-thinking, 33-yr old adult married woman & mother.” Around the same time, Newsom revisited the affair. “I acknowledged it. I apologized for it. I learned an enormous amount from it,’’ he said.

By the late 2010s, Newsom had a personal reason for supporting the #MeToo movement; his second wife is Jennifer Siebel Newsom, an outspoken feminist and a sexual-assault survivor. She was involved with two films about gender roles in America: Miss Representation, about girls, in 2011, and The Mask You Live In, which tackled men’s issues, in 2015. She testified that she’d been raped by Harvey Weinstein in 2005. (The jury could not reach a verdict in her case.) In keeping with her feminist principles, Siebel Newsom is not California’s first lady, but its “first partner.”

Their relationship started with a blind date at a fundraising gala at the Yerba Buena Center in 2006, and within 18 months, Newsom had proposed with a Tiffany diamond ring. They married that summer in a field in Montana, and Stanlee Gatti did the decor. The bride rode to the aisle sidesaddle on a black stallion; the groom wore a tan suit; the theme was “Out of Africa.” The ceremony was conducted by Carol Simone, a “modern day mystic” whose website describes her as a medium, an astrologer, and a tarot practitioner. Bill Newsom arrived in Gordon Getty’s plane.

The Newsoms now have four children, ages 9 to 16: Montana, Brooklynn, Hunter, and Dutch. Gatti told me that marriage and kids had settled Newsom; he had run into his friend and his son at a museum one morning during the pandemic, and noticed how relaxed he looked. “He had his hair floppy. Some people didn’t even recognize him.” (Newsom’s hair, usually slicked back, has been a source of admiration and horror for two decades. His secret, he once told American Idol’s Ryan Seacrest, was L’Oréal Total Control Clean Gel.)

Amid all of his personal upheaval, Newsom ran for—and easily won—reelection as mayor. He was such an obvious shoo-in that the race became a kind of circus: His opponents included a performance artist, a nudist activist, and the owner of a sex club. Tellingly, both the artist, “Chicken John” Rinaldi, and the sex-club owner, Michael Powers, told me they no longer live in San Francisco. Rinaldi was priced out and lives in Isleton, an hour east of the Bay. Powers moved right politically and didn’t feel welcome in California anymore. He now lives in Nevada. “I’m definitely a tried-and-true libertarian,” Powers said. “I believe that gay guys ought to be able to protect their weed fields with assault rifles.”

After Newsom won his second term, in 2007, Gatti designed an inauguration ceremony with 2,000 yellow roses spread across two giant urns, to fill the grand scale of city hall. The very same day, Newsom attended the swearing-in of the city’s newly reelected district attorney, Kamala Harris. The two have known each other for decades, but they are not close, sharing neither friends nor a political philosophy. In her book 107 Days, Harris recounts that Newsom did not pick up when she called him to discuss Joe Biden dropping out of the race in the summer of 2024—and, by implication, her need for a running mate. Newsom has said that he did not recognize her number.

The looming end of his second term as mayor presented Newsom with a problem. The obvious next step was to run for California governor in 2010, but his candidacy faltered once the old warhorse Jerry Brown—who had already served in the position in the ’70s and ’80s—made it clear he was entering the race. Newsom settled for lieutenant governor, a largely ceremonial position that he won easily. He chafed at his lack of responsibilities, and took advantage of Brown’s absences to pull stunts such as naming the avocado the official state fruit.

Newsom essentially spent eight years treading water—or, as I put it to him in Sacramento, just vibing. “I appreciate that perspective,” he replied, a politician’s phrase meaning screw you. He has now recast these years of avocado-bothering as a “gestation period of sorts,” where he spent time “working with the Brookings Institute, working with McKinsey, working on best-practices policy, urban policy, ultimately writing the first economic plan for the state.” An unhappy Jerry Brown “tried to torpedo me on that,” Newsom told me, and refused to appoint a committee to take the plan forward. (Brown declined my interview request.) “I was literally neutered,” he added. “It was quite brilliant, looking back as a gubernatorial play. I despised it at the time. Now I appreciate it.”

To fill the time, he hosted The Gavin Newsom Show on Current TV, interviewing a pre-bonkers Elon Musk about Tesla, listening to Oliver Stone praise California’s weed, and trying on Sergey Brin’s Google Glass. He also wrote a none-more-2010s book called Citizenville—a title inspired by the game Farmville—which discussed how digital innovation could transform government.

In 2018, after Brown retired, Newsom won the governor’s race with 62 percent of the vote. He has taken up a number of fashionable liberal causes, although some of these have fared badly on contact with electoral reality. For example, he declared that the state “could finally beat Big Oil” in 2013, and signed legislation that banned fracking and restricted oil drilling near sensitive sites—then approved a law allowing 2,000 new drilling licenses in Kern County this past September, citing high gas prices.

The Stanford professor Keith Humphreys worked on a blue-ribbon commission to reform cannabis laws with Newsom in the 2010s. Their original vision, he told me, was one that prioritized public health and put social justice over profit. “Gavin articulated this beautifully in the press,” Humphreys said. But the legislation that ended up being drafted and approved by voters “weakened the public-good aspirations of our commission and created a more profit-driven model, and Gavin didn’t utter a word of protest. Is this because he didn’t know the details were different, or is it because he didn’t mind, because he gets a lot of campaign donations from the cannabis industry? I genuinely don’t know the answer to that even now.” Legalization meant that big producers, operating on tiny margins, moved in and actively looked for new customers.

In September, Newsom signed a bill to roll back taxes on the legal-cannabis industry, because the regulatory burden has left it struggling to compete with the black market. Doing something that is sold as socially progressive, but ends up benefiting big-money donors, and then wrapping it up in so much regulation and taxation that the policy collapses under its own weight—how dysfunctionally California is that?

But the state’s biggest challenge is the cost of living—specifically, housing. Newsom has recently started name-checking the Abundance movement, which aims to convince Democrats that overregulation and NIMBYism are holding back the growth of blue states. He has signed a series of bills meant to make housing construction easier. But these efforts have yet to bear much fruit, and the candidates to succeed him as governor—he is term-limited—are making housing affordability a centerpiece of their campaigns, too. Mid-tier home prices in California are around double the national average.

“He’s much given to—like Trump, in a way—making these grand pronouncements about how something’s the greatest ever, how this is going to be the most wonderful thing,” the veteran California journalist Jerry Roberts told me, “and then his record is littered with failures.” Still, you try to get anything passed in California, a state with strong labor unions, a cadre of well-funded lobbyists, and a masochistic addiction to requiring approval via ballot measure.

The minutiae of policy may matter less in a national election, however, than the overall sense that California is too far left—and so its governor must be, too. Newsom twice supported ballot measures to repeal the death penalty in California, boasts about providing health care to undocumented immigrants, and in 2014 was the only statewide elected official to back Proposition 47, which reclassified some nonviolent offenses as misdemeanors rather than felonies. At the time, he said that there was “a growing, rational thinking around moving in a new direction” on crime and rehabilitation that other politicians were scared to embrace. Opponents drew a direct line between those reforms and the locked plastic cases around the goods in many San Francisco stores. I brought up Prop 47 as Exhibit A in the Republican argument that Newsom is too liberal for Middle America. “California is one of the toughest felony thresholds for shoplifting in America, period,” he said, adding that the felony limit is $950, whereas in supposedly tough Texas, it is $2,500. To Newsom’s mind, the charge that he is soft on crime is “complete mythology, and makes you question the press.”

On social issues, Newsom has already acted to mitigate the weakness of being associated with Californian wokery. Two of the first guests on his interview podcast, This Is Gavin Newsom, were Charlie Kirk and Steve Bannon, ensuring that people actually listened to the show. Kirk advised him to “run to the middle” and say “no men in female sports.” Newsom conceded the broader point—“I think it’s an issue of fairness” —before retreating to the standard Democratic talking points: Not many athletes are involved. This is a marginalized community with high suicide rates. The Republicans had been able to “weaponize the issue.” But even those tentative words were enough, Newsom told me, to cause a huge backlash within his own tent. Two members of the California legislature’s LGBTQ caucus declared that they were “profoundly sickened and frustrated” by his words.

“What’s so interesting is how painful that position is to many members of my party,” he says now. “And I’ve lost relationships and friendships because of that position.” He argues that his record of pro-LGBTQ bills gives him the ability to look for compromises; he also has a trans godson, 33-year-old Nats Getty. “I have someone I love dearly who went through a transition,” he says.

Hasn’t America been waiting for a politician who can hold this middle ground, I ask, someone who can say that we should treat everyone with respect and dignity, but also acknowledge that in some circumstances—sports, prisons—biological sex matters? “I agree,” Newsom says, before becoming uncharacteristically ineloquent. “Yeah. It’s … I … I’ve just—it’s been—it’s been really, it’s been an interesting—” He is “hesitating,” he tells me, because he has just recorded a podcast reflecting on the year, including his conversation with Kirk, who was assassinated in September.

Another reason for hesitation might be that California has other laws that must have the makers of Republican attack ads salivating with anticipation. In 2020, the state passed S.B. 132, allowing male criminals to self-identify into women’s prisons. One of those transferred, Tremaine Carroll, is awaiting trial on charges of raping two female inmates. (Carroll denies the charges.) A.B. 1955, passed in July 2024, prevents schools from having to inform parents if their children have adopted new names and pronouns. I bring up the latter example with Newsom. He reframes it, saying that the law was aimed to stop “commanding that teachers become snitches and say, You’ll be fired if you don’t snitch on a child. And it wasn’t about trans issues. It wasn’t just transitioning. It was around sexual orientation generally.” Under the Republicans’ preferred laws, he says, “if Bobby was going to dress up as a woman, you were compelled to then turn that child in.”

Heading into a general election, Newsom has a choice on how to treat his policy record: full-throated defense or brutal disownment. He could also try to reject the premise, rehabilitating the image of California as a place of innovation and dynamism, rather than the socialist dystopia conjured up by his ex-wife. Newsom is already thinking about this strategy, arguing that some people suffer from what he jokingly calls “California Derangement Syndrome.” His staff recently gave him a 1977 Time article about how the California “dream fizzled”—to add to the 1994 Time article decrying “clogged freeways, eye-stinging smog, despoiled landscapes, polluted beaches, water shortages, unaffordable housing, overcrowded schools and beleaguered industries.” His point is that people love to declare the end of the Golden State.

Pelosi too pushed back on the idea that the rest of the country hates California. “I don’t know that we attract hatred,” the former speaker told me. “We have jealousy.” Padilla also disputes the popular characterization of the state. “There’s 58 counties in California, the majority of which are Republican,” the senator told me, adding, “It’s a lot more diverse than people think.”

That might well be, but unlike Bill Clinton—who succeeded as a Democrat in conservative Arkansas—Newsom has not yet shown he can outperform his party. He won his second governor’s race, in 2022, with 59 percent of the vote. Two years later, Harris won California’s electoral college with 58 percent. Newsom’s policies on capital punishment and gun control “are very popular among the Democratic base,” Jerry Roberts told me, “but I don’t know how that’s going to sell in western Pennsylvania, or South Carolina for that matter.”

All right, let’s talk about the tweets. The redistricting fight showed one version of Newsom’s strength, as he ran an expensive anti-Trump campaign focused on the threat to democracy and civil rights. His online presence, however, demonstrates that he can also mock Trump like a mean ninth grader. This is the work of a team of young staffers, whose Sacramento-office door carries an AI-generated image of Newsom being prayed over by Kid Rock, Tucker Carlson, and Hulk Hogan (RIP). Newsom is not Michelle Obama: When they go low, Newsom’s team goes even lower. (Despite this freewheeling approach, Newsom is not an informal boss; his staff calls him Governor, not Gavin.)

On X, the governor’s account pumps out all-caps posts in a pitch-perfect imitation of the president’s style. When Fox News attacked Newsom, he released a statement that read: “FOX HATES THAT I AM AMERICA’S MOST FAVORITE GOVERNOR (‘RATINGS KING’) SAVING AMERICA – WHILE TRUMP CAN’T EVEN CONQUER THE ‘BIG’ STAIRS ON AIR FORCE ONE ANY MORE!!!” Last month, he released a fake physical from the “California Department of Peak Excellence,” claiming that he remains “the healthiest person alive and ever to live.”

These Trump parodies are aimed at journalists and activists and have already garnered headlines such as “How Gavin Newsom Trolled His Way to the Top of Social Media.” On TikTok, he pursues a more populist strategy, pumping out caustic videos steeped in meme culture. He has 2.9 million followers there, the same as conservative commentator Ben Shapiro. In October, he joined a Fortnite game with the popular streamer ConnorEatsPants, as an overture to young men. (“Fifty-one percent of 18- to 24-year-olds have never asked a girl on a date,” he told me at one point, shaking his head. “Fifty-one percent. That’s just scary.”) For their dads, meanwhile, there’s the podcast with Marshawn Lynch.

Newsom has also taken his happy-if-bitchy-warrior act into hostile territory by appearing on MAGA podcasts. In July, he spent four hours talking with Shawn Ryan, a former Navy SEAL and Blackwater contractor who shares Joe Rogan’s suspicion of the “deep state” and America’s “forever” wars. Newsom accepted the gift of a pistol, a Sig Sauer P365-Xmacro, saying, “I’m not anti-gun at all.” (The NRA was unimpressed, noting that Newsom wants a Twenty-Eighth Amendment to raise the age of gun ownership, institute waiting periods, and ban assault weapons.) He burnished his common-man credentials by owning up to a 960 score on the SAT—below average—and claiming not to be able to pronounce “bona fides.” He recounted a conversation where he used the word Latinx. “And then my chief of staff, who happens to be Hispanic, goes, ‘Would you shut up?’”

Newsom can handle these breezy, expletive-filled conversations because he has none of Harris’s paralyzing caution. “He can be very cautious and calculating, as any politician with a 30-year track record would probably have to be,” Alex Clemens, the political strategist, told me. “But he also, on multiple occasions, including in this moment now, has shown a remarkable boldness in being able to say: I’m going off script.” (Trump’s military operation in Venezuela was not one of those times, however. Instead of posting a spicy tweet, Newsom released an official statement about the need for “democracy, human rights, and stability” that could have come from any Democrat.)

In the Ryan interview, Newsom said he was a fan of The Joe Rogan Experience—but “he won’t have me on the show, by the way.” Rogan left California during COVID, and is still energized by annoyance at its masking and school-closure rules. The governor has turned Rogan’s snub into another running feud, in posts baiting the “snack-sized podcaster.” Newsom is apparently betting that the next presidential election will be fought based on good vibes and naked aggression. “You would have never heard Gavin do these things—like troll Trump in the way he’s doing now,” Stanlee Gatti told me. But Newsom is “smart enough to know that’s the only way you can fight an idiot like Trump.”

The instant I mention this combative social-media strategy, Newsom knows where I’m going. “We didn’t like the Marie Antoinette?” he says, joshing me. He is referring to the haunting AI-generated image that he’d circulated of Trump decked out in pearls and a towering gray wig. Appealing to his press aide Bob Salladay, sitting quietly in the corner of the room, he adds: “Did we offend her?” The Trump image, Newsom suggests, has upset my “European mindset.”

I make a face to indicate that my problem is not, in fact, that I am a French monarchist. What bothered me, I say, was a post on X addressed to the right-wing influencer Chaya Raichik, better known as Libs of TikTok. Repeating a comment that Trump had recently made to a female reporter, the post from Newsom’s official account read: “Quiet, piggy.” Is it right to bring back misogyny to public life? “That’s good feedback, Bob,” concedes Newsom, looking precisely zero percent abashed. The piggy post was, he argues, just a “play” on Trump’s own words. Newsom insists that his posts are simply holding up a “reflective mirror” to the president, trying to show America what has become normalized.

Plus, Newsom adds with a mischievous look, it’s funny to watch “the propaganda networks, the Pravda networks, Fox and others, that seemed so taken aback by it, so deeply offended by such childish behavior on my part. Wash his poor mouth with soap!” Even those who think his posts are wrong can’t deny that they demonstrate aggression and ambition. If nothing else, this iteration of Newsom is not a snowflake.

In person, Newsom showed more depth than I expected from his hey-man-wassup podcast appearances and his sassy online clapbacks. He is self-aware, and he can be self-deprecating, too. “I know you’re saying, your lying eyes,” he told me, when I looked skeptical about his claim to have reduced homelessness in the state. He has even found a way to deal with his single biggest screwup—his COVID-era decision to attend a birthday party at the French Laundry, the three-Michelin-starred restaurant in Yountville where the prix fixe menu starts at $425 a person. (The gathering was for his friend, the lobbyist Jason Kinney, who’d led the campaign to legalize marijuana.)

That meal might be the single worst entertainment choice in American political history since Lincoln decided to see Our American Cousin. The French Laundry incident drove support for a recall election in 2021, although Newsom won by a margin of almost two to one.

The governor has come up with an unusual approach to the scandal: unconditional apology. When Ryan told Newsom that, before their conversation, he despised many of his actions, his guest concurred. “I’d despise me for the shit I read too—I despise me for the French Laundry,” he said, pointing emphatically at Ryan. “I beat the shit out of myself for that. And everyone who criticized me is goddamn right.” The abject contrition left Ryan with nowhere to go.

The most pleasant surprise of meeting Newsom was discovering that he has thought deeply about the history and future of the Democratic Party. He has referred to himself as a “Sargent Shriver Democrat,” after the architect of the War on Poverty and the founding director of the Peace Corps. (Shriver also benefited from connections with an extremely powerful family.) The hallway outside Newsom’s office is lined with photographs taken from the train that brought Robert F. Kennedy’s body from his funeral in New York City to his grave in Arlington National Cemetery. These offer an extraordinary portrait of the United States at a particularly unsettled moment: a cool ’60s couple on a motorbike; a row of kids in height order, lined up in their underwear to pay tribute; men with their hats doffed, held against their chest.

The photographs are a reminder of the decency of ordinary Americans, and a memento mori, a warning of the risks to which Newsom is exposing himself. He reveres Kennedy and frequently refers to his speeches; he used to be friendly with his son RFK Jr. until the latter went full MAGA. Even now, there’s a touch of wistfulness in how he talks about the younger Kennedy. When I bring up Newsom’s morning routine—lemon water, sit-ups, cold plunge, a regimen that reminds me of Christian Bale in American Psycho—I concede that it is healthier than my recent diet of hotel-breakfast bacon shot through with chemical preservatives. “See, this is where RFK and I agree—on ultra-processed foods,” he says.

On the day we met, Newsom had so far supplemented his lemon water with a smoothie and chicken salad. Looking at the lean figure in front of me, in a finely tailored tweed jacket, sneakers, and incongruous Millennial ankle socks, I resist the urge to ask if he tracks his macros. The outfit is Newsom’s usual style, taking him from podcast to potluck: unstuffy without being quite casual either. “I did send him a text the other day and said: Do I need to buy you a new shirt?” Gatti said. “Because it seems like he wears that blue—it looks like blue denim or something—I feel like he wears it all the time.” Newsom was indeed wearing it for our interview, having come straight from recording his end-of-year podcast. Maybe he has 90 identical ones.

Tom Nichols: MAGA world is so close to getting it

Several of my interviewees had likened Newsom to Bill Clinton. Newsom had retrieved his annotated copy of Clinton’s My Life from his office shelf after I told him that the title of his own memoir, Young Man in a Hurry, was oddly reminiscent of the last line of Clinton’s prologue: “Even when I wasn’t sure where I was going, I was always in a hurry.” Newsom’s title actually comes from a 2009 Economist article that described his time as mayor as “a stimulus package for the conservative movement,” but he was delighted at the unintentional echo: “I have a soft spot and a bit of a bias towards President Clinton, as you may or may not know.”

The two men share some of the same strengths—personal charm, ease with all kinds of people—and the same weaknesses for rich friends, the high life, and the ladies. A dog, maybe, but an alpha dog, masculine without being macho. Newsom’s personal history has more dents in the bumper than, say, blameless Pete Buttigieg’s does, but I’m not sure that voters care anymore—better a record of wild mistakes than one of perfect, cautious tedium.

Toward the end of our conversation, I asked Newsom for his thoughts on a set of proposals for the next president outlined by the legal scholar Cass Sunstein: restricting the pardon power, plus a strong presumption against personal lawsuits brought by the president, or prosecuting members of the previous administration.

“I’m suing Fox,” Newsom replied. “A $787 million defamation lawsuit, so you’re talking to the wrong person.” (The legal action, over a host who accused Newsom of lying, is another piece of trolling: The governor is seeking the same amount Fox News paid to Dominion Voting Systems for airing false claims that its machines were rigged in 2020.) As for the pardons, he had a batch on his desk right now, so “it’s not an academic exercise for me.” He thought that formally restricting the pardon power was less important than electing a president who wouldn’t abuse it. “It’s about temperance. It’s about wisdom, the Stoic values. It’s about justice. You can go through all of them, all four. Character has to be represented in the person we put in that office.” But Gerald Ford pardoned Richard Nixon in the name of national unity, I said. Would blue America accept a leader who drew a line under Trumpism, rather than promising to litigate its alleged offenses?

“There’s a sort of romantic version if you’re writing the script and you’ve got a nice soundtrack in the background,” Newsom said. “At the inaugural, the next president announces that he’s turning the page—” He caught himself. “Or she is turning the page on all of this. Throngs of boos, maybe, in the audience; I don’t know. ’Cause there’s a sense of vengeance and two can play this game, fight fire with fire.” At the same time, he thought that the country was exhausted. “There is an Isaiah part of all of this: We need whoever the next president is to be a ‘repairer of the breach.’ That should be a big part of the messaging for the next president. I hope they can maybe read the serenity prayer.”

These words might sound strange coming from a man who recently posted an AI-generated video of Trump in handcuffs. But I suspect that Gavin Newsom has a two-part strategy for reaching the presidency: wrestle with MAGA until the midterms, and then pivot to the high (and center) ground with kumbaya and jobs of the future for 2028. He admires Ronald Reagan’s final address as president, he said, a paean to immigration and the flaming torch of Lady Liberty. He must be longing to give a speech like that in a presidential campaign.

Until then, though, he is fighting a dirty war, one that does not observe the political equivalent of the Geneva Convention. Rather than demand respect from Republicans who won’t give it, he is getting right down in the muck with them, blasting Musk’s parenting and posting photographs of Trump with Jeffrey Epstein. Newsom’s communications director even called the singer Nicki Minaj a “stupid hoe” for criticizing the governor. This, to Newsom, is being strong; the right are the fainthearted schoolmarms now. His merchandise store has a page touting MAGA-branded kneepads, for “all your groveling to Trump needs—now in Republican red.”

            <h2>Six Books You Can Get Lost In</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-01-06</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/books/2026/01/books-recommendation-daydream-fantasy/685504/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Many people—the overwhelmed, dissatisfied, or understimulated—share a powerful desire to escape the life they’re living. But doing so usually isn’t practical or possible. What is available is the daydream—a limitless realm of freedom. In this other world, one  might be famous or rich, finally catch the attention of their beloved, or simply sit on a beach as a waiter brings them cocktails. They might fly or speak to animals, heroically save a child, tell off their boss with no consequences, win the Super Bowl at the whistle, or travel to another continent, planet, or time period. No one can stop them; no one can even object.

Some writers are naturally drawn to this kind of reverie. Daydreams can illuminate our hidden, anarchic, or even seductive inclinations, and they can say a lot about our conscious lives. Their conjurers, who refuse to accept the rules of the real world, can also be great fun to read about. While working on my new novel, The Ten Year Affair, which follows a woman fantasizing about a love affair with a longtime friend, I thought about what happens when speculation or wishing starts to bleed into the real. Daydreaming, I realized, can sustain a person over the course of a life—and perhaps even change it, for good or for ill. The six books below explore the limitations and hazards of dreaming, even as they push the boundaries and conventions of the act.

The title of Yi’s strange and appealing 2023 novel refers to, as the unnamed narrator puts it, “a type of fanfiction where the protagonist was called Y/N or ‘your name.’” The narrator attends a K-pop show in Berlin and becomes obsessed with the band’s youngest member, the 20-year-old Moon: “a gift forever in the moment of being handed over,” Yi writes. As the narrator’s fixation grows, she begins writing Y/N fan fiction about Moon, much of which is reproduced in the novel. When Moon abruptly retires, the narrator goes to Korea to find him. Some readers might expect an indictment of fan fiction and celebrity culture; Yi swerves, though, and creates a more searching and subversive tale of love, connection, and art. Even after the narrator finds Moon, her motives remain obscure. The point of her fantasy seems to be the fantasy itself.

Jackson’s fascinating novel follows Natalie, the daughter of a writer, as she unravels during her first few months of college. At the opening, Natalie, bored and filled with loathing for her parents, flees her family home by retreating into imaginary worlds of vivid, eroticized violence. But just before she can escape to college, she’s sexually assaulted at a family party. This leads to three claustrophobic months on campus, as a traumatized Natalie fails to connect with her peers, falls in with the hard-drinking wife of her professor, and finally befriends an odd apparition created by her own mind. Hangsaman is a horror-tinged investigation into how the pressures of mid-century sexual politics affect one woman: Natalie’s unsettling hallucination is an unexpected expression of freedom, and she uses it to buck the stereotype of the kind of girl her parents, and society, expect her to be.

Like Austen’s other novels, Northanger Abbey contains a marriage plot. But it’s set apart from the rest of her work by a long, satirical section sending up gothic fiction and its fans. The book’s heroine, Catherine Morland, is an avid reader of the popular novels of the day, and has a specific fondness for Ann Radcliffe’s real-life 1794 best seller, The Mysteries of Udolpho, a tale of ghostly figures and hidden manuscripts. Catherine views herself as the hero of a similar story, and when she goes to the country house of a family she has befriended (the titular Northanger Abbey), she reinvents herself as the protagonist of a mystery. Austen is the master of depicting small faux pas, and Catherine commits many—she forces open cabinets in search of creepy documents; she begins to suspect that the family patriarch has murdered his wife. The chronic daydreamer can easily identify with Catherine’s near-delusional longing for something to happen beyond the courtships and evenings around the pianoforte that seem to make up the better part of her future.

Jonathan Abernathy You Are Kind, by Molly McGhee

Abernathy, the everyman at the center of McGhee’s funny and moving novel, is drowning in debt: thousands of dollars of combined student loans and his dead parents’ bills. In a desperate attempt to make his payments, he takes a shady government gig as an auditor of dreams. In exchange for $20 a night and substantial debt relief, he’s tasked with going inside the dreams of corporate office workers and flagging anxieties that might make them less productive; once noted, bad feelings or thoughts will be literally sucked into oblivion by his superiors. Soon enough, though, Abernathy begins to wonder what these losses do to a person. McGhee’s world is dark, a place where overworked sleepers grieve and worry. McGhee’s humor and anticapitalist critique reminded me of George Saunders and Karen Russell; dopey, affable Abernathy also gets his redemption. Plus, the story fully realizes its premise: Readers will see what happens to a dream deferred—or, rather, vacuumed up.

Rushdie’s sprawling picaresque is, as the title promises, a riff on Don Quixote. But in this version, set in a contemporary world resembling our own, where politics is a spectacle, the main character’s delusions revolve around television. Quichotte aspires to woo a daytime-talk-show host, Salma R, the gorgeous and talented heir apparent to Oprah’s throne. Here, Sancho is Quichotte’s imagined 15-year-old-son, an apparition made up of the flickering black-and-white fuzz of early TV, who rides along in the passenger seat of Quichotte’s car. The story of Quichotte’s quest is being written, in alternating chapters, by Sam DuChamp, a mid-list spy novelist making his first foray into literary fiction. As DuChamp dreams a story about a classic dreamer, he weaves in his own biography and disappointments, and the book likewise layers fancy on top of memory, examining the human tendency to mythologize.

The Lathe of Heaven, by Ursula K. Le Guin

Set in Portland, Oregon, in a bleak, overpopulated near future, The Lathe of Heaven is built around the banal question What if your dreams came true? But Le Guin’s answer is astonishing. Her protagonist, the “milquetoast, repressed, conventional” George Orr, has the ability to rewrite reality with his dreams, changing both the past and the present. When he’s sent to therapy for drug addiction, his therapist, Dr. Haber, finds that he can suggest dreams to Orr that will achieve goals big and small. But the dreams don’t always deliver the hoped-for outcomes—and Haber isn’t the most well-meaning steward of Orr’s gift: Haber’s suggestion for a solution to the population problem results in a horrific pandemic; his request for peace on Earth brings aliens into the picture. Le Guin examines unchecked power, eugenics, and the ethics of governance in this inventive and consistently surprising novel, which explores the limits of trying to manifest a better world.

            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-01-06</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/press-releases/2026/01/atlantics-february-cover-five-years-since-jan-6/685480/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">On the fifth anniversary of the January 6 insurrection, The Atlantic’s staff writer Jamie Thompson examines why a former Marine and retired NYPD officer would assault a fellow cop that day––profiling both the insurrectionist, Thomas Webster, as well as an officer who was assaulted on January 6, Daniel Hodges. Thompson’s piece, “Is This What Patriotism Looks Like?,” The Atlantic’s February cover story, is accompanied by editor in chief Jeffrey Goldberg’s “The Triumph of Indecency,” on the importance of being appalled by Donald Trump’s pardoning of the insurrectionists.  Goldberg, who attended the January 6 rally on the Ellipse, writes that “the pardoning by Trump of his cop-beating foot soldiers represents the lowest moment of this presidency so far, because it was an act not only of naked despotism but also of outlandish hypocrisy. By pardoning these criminals, he exposed a foundational lie of MAGA ideology: that it stands with the police and as a guarantor of law and order. The truth is the opposite.” Goldberg continues: “Much has been said, including by me, about Trump’s narcissism, his autocratic inclinations, his disconnection from reality, but not nearly enough has been said about his fundamental indecency, the characteristic that undergirds everything he says and does.”  Thompson’s cover story begins in the early-morning hours of January 5, 2021, when Thomas Webster, then 54, drove south on I-95 toward Washington, D.C. Thompson writes that Webster had been conflicted about whether to attend the “Save America” rally, “but Donald Trump had used the word patriot. Webster had joined the military at 19, taken his first plane ride to boot camp in South Carolina, gotten his first taste of lobster tail on a ship in the Mediterranean. He loved the sense of purpose he’d drawn from the oath he’d sworn when he joined the Marines: I will support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic.”  Once a conventional Republican who’d thought Trump “said some crazy-ass shit,” Webster had over the course of the pandemic shutdowns of 2020 gotten drawn “more and more deeply into the MAGA camp.” He believed Trump’s claims that the 2020 election had been “stolen,” and on January 6 he used a flagpole to assault MPD Officer Noah Rathbun. Thompson writes that at the sentencing, in September 2022, “a prosecutor acknowledged that people like Webster might have been pawns in a political game, but added: ‘Even if he didn’t know better than to believe Trump’s lies, he knew better than to assault a fellow cop, no matter the circumstances.’”  After serving a little more than two years of his 10-year sentence, Webster was pardoned by Trump on his first day back in office. Thompson writes: “Webster says he barely recognizes the version of himself who drove to D.C. five years ago. Who was that man filled with so much bravado that he thought he could save the country? His days of charging into the fray are over, he said. Sometimes he feels guilty about the life he has now. So many of the J6 defendants have been divorced by their wives, disowned by their kids, fired from their jobs. By Webster’s count, at least five have died by suicide. Yet he still views Trump as the best hope for cleaning out the deep state. ‘He’s the one person I still kind of believe in,’ Webster said.”  Webster’s story is contrasted with that of Daniel Hodges, an officer who was assaulted while defending the Capitol that day: “Hodges was trapped, his whole body getting crushed. His arms hung uselessly at his sides. He effectively could not move his legs. A man wrapped his hand around Hodges’s gas mask, violently shoving it back and forth and then ripping it off, shouting what sounded like ‘How do you like me now, fucker?’ As Hodges stood there, scared and vulnerable, the man grabbed his baton and bashed him on the head with it, rupturing his lip and smashing his skull.”  Hodges tells his story publicly because he thinks it’s important to prevent history from being rewritten. When Thompson told him that Webster still believes the election might have been stolen, Hodges was not surprised. “He doesn’t think people like Webster will stop lying to themselves anytime soon. ‘They can’t,’ Hodges said; the cognitive dissonance and moral pain would be too great.” Thompson continues: “Accepting reality would mean reevaluating everything they thought they knew—that their actions were ethical and justified, that they are great patriots. Accepting the truth of January 6 would require coming to grips with the fact that they supported a con man and participated in a violent plot to subvert democracy.”  “To grapple with these truths,” Hodges told Thompson, “would, in a very real way, unmake them.” When Americans reelected Trump, Thompson writes, “Hodges felt a deep sense of grief. During 11 years of policing, he’d seen people do terrible things to one another—­ shootings, stabbings, maimings. But the election results strained his faith in humanity more than any of that. After all Trump has done? Hodges thought. After all we know about him?” Both Hodges and Harry Dunn, a former Capitol Police officer, “long ago grew tired of talk about the ‘shifting narrative’ of January 6. ‘Ain’t no narrative,’ Dunn likes to say. ‘Play the tape.’”  Jamie Thompson’s “Is This What Patriotism Looks Like?” and Jeffrey Goldberg’s “The Triumph of Indecency” have published at TheAtlantic.com.

            <h2>January 6 Was My Fourth Day on the Hill</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-01-06</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/2026/01/january-6-anniversary-insurrection/685183/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">January 6, 2021, was my fourth day on Capitol Hill. I was fresh out of law school and working as a senior aide for Mondaire Jones, a newly elected Democratic member of Congress from New York. Most of his staff were queer, Jewish, Black, or some combination thereof, and our very presence felt like a rejection of the waning Trump era. We knew that Republicans had organized a rally to protest the congressional certification of the presidential election, but we were focused on different news: Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock had won their runoff elections in Georgia, giving Democrats control of the Senate. Suddenly our party had the majorities it needed to pass legislation that would improve people’s lives.

There were signs that January 6 was going to be an unusual day. The House would not be in session until the afternoon, but we were asked to arrive before 8 a.m. On my drive to work, I saw hundreds of people wearing MAGA hats and flying “Stop the Steal” flags—rare flashes of red in deep-blue D.C. They’d traveled far, I thought. But the rally felt less threatening than futile.

At one that afternoon, Jones went to the House floor for the vote to certify the results. Shortly after, we received a cryptic update via the Capitol’s emergency-alert system ordering us to shelter in place due to “police activity.” We feared this was connected to reports that Capitol Police had discovered a “suspicious package” in the area, and we worried that we might be in the blast radius of an explosive. Still, we continued working while we followed a live feed of the House proceedings.

At about 2:15, in the middle of his speech objecting to the certification of Arizona’s electoral votes, Representative Paul Gosar stopped to call for order in the chamber. We weren’t sure why; the mics weren’t picking up any disturbance. Then the camera cut to members of Congress rushing toward the doors. We watched first with confusion, then with fear as we heard screams and pleas to lock the door before the feed cut.

We scrambled for information. A glance outside our back window, which faced away from the Capitol, revealed nothing; we drew the blinds. Aside from a few vague alerts warning of a “security threat,” our only intel came from Twitter, TV, and texts from equally confused colleagues. Americans following along at home knew as much as we did.

Reports began to filter in that insurrectionists, some of whom were believed to be armed and on a mission to kill, had breached the Capitol. My colleagues and I watched footage of the mob smashing windows, ramming down doors, and swarming the rotunda; one man brandished a Confederate flag; another wore a Camp Auschwitz sweatshirt. Just that morning, a colleague had hung Pride and Black Lives Matter flags outside our office. We didn’t know whether our building had been invaded, but we knew those flags would make us a target. We momentarily broke the shelter-in-place order to pull them down, then we locked the door and dragged a heavy leather couch in front of it.

It was my first week on the job. I barely knew where the bathrooms were. I had no idea how to deal with a siege.

Another House office building had been evacuated, and the employees there were told to take shelter in our building. They weren’t told exactly where to go, though, so many came to our door in search of safety. Each knock was a jump scare. Roughly 20 members of Congress and their staff, Democrats and Republicans, accumulated in our office. We shared bags of barbecue chips and peanut M&Ms that a colleague had brought in that morning, and made small talk about office decor, our favorite D.C. restaurants, our hometowns—anything to drown out the terror on our screens and the eerie silence outside our door.

That day was full of things that were not supposed to happen, but did. The more we learned about what was going on outside—the mob had zip ties; it was erecting gallows in front of the Capitol and chanting for blood—the more possible it seemed that we could be injured or even killed. Our reactions varied: One colleague wept when he saw the “QAnon Shaman” in the speaker’s chair; another sat silently, texting loved ones; I mostly made dark jokes.

Our boss, who had been whisked off the House floor to a secure location, was only intermittently reachable. In the early evening, his phone died and we lost contact with him entirely. Since Jones had launched his campaign nearly two years ago, he and I had been in near-constant touch. I considered him a close friend, and I was terrified for him. Even after we learned that the Capitol complex had been cleared, and watched through our office window as dejected insurrectionists shuffled away, we still did not hear from Jones. Only when he showed up in our office unannounced at about 6:30 p.m., clutching a gas mask, as close to speechless as I would ever see him, did we know for certain that he was alive.

We heard that Nancy Pelosi was planning to call the House back into session so that Congress could fulfill its duty to certify the election. We had a few hours of respite while first responders cleared the Capitol of debris. Famished after eating nothing but chips and candy, I found some sad chicken tenders in the cafeteria.

When the House gaveled back into session around 9 p.m., some Republicans continued to dispute the election results. Their antics extended for almost seven more hours, which I spent curled up on an office couch, the proceedings droning on in the background. Jones and I drove home at 4 a.m. during a citywide curfew, past buildings boarded up with plywood.

I was shell-shocked; for months, I couldn’t sleep through the night. But on January 7, I woke up feeling hopeful. My colleagues and I had lived through one of the most terrible days in American history, but I believed that something good would have to come of it. A violent, desperate outburst had laid bare the authoritarianism at the center of Trump’s movement. Surely now Americans would finally shut the door on him.

Trump was banned from several social-media platforms. Republican senators including Lindsey Graham publicly rebuked him; then–Minority Leader Mitch McConnell privately expressed support for his impeachment, according to some reports. Democrats, recognizing an opportunity to prove that they could deliver on their promises, seemed poised to push through legislation that would end partisan gerrymandering and expand the social safety net.

Read: Republicans once thought January 6 was ‘tragic’

This period of hope was short-lived. By the time I left the Hill, in June 2022, the Republicans who had, for a moment, grown a conscience had either fallen back in line behind Trump or been excommunicated. Elon Musk was in the process of buying Twitter, and had promised to return Trump to the platform. A coalition of cynics and sycophants had pried the door back open for Trump. After one congressional Republican described the riot of January 6 as a “normal tourist visit,” and the Republican National Committee called its perpetrators “ordinary citizens engaged in legitimate political discourse,” the American people handed the GOP control of the House.

I moved abroad that December. I was fed up not just with American politics, but with America. Democrats had squandered what I felt was our best chance at solving the nation’s problems, and now a completely unhinged version of the GOP was careening toward power.

Still, I struggled to imagine that Americans would actually vote Trump himself back into the White House. When they did, I felt horrified for my country, and also personally betrayed. Trump had promised to pardon the insurrectionists, who were willing to do almost anything to keep people like me from wielding power. Apparently, 77 million of my fellow Americans were okay with that.

Looking back now, as Trump consolidates his authoritarian approach, I can see that January 6 portended not an end, but the beginning of a new era of nihilism.

Trump’s supporters are emboldened. They punish their enemies and reward their friends. They have turned the power of the state against the free press and universities, trans people and immigrants. They have slashed Medicaid to fund tax cuts for the wealthy, and have redrawn electoral maps in an effort to keep themselves in power.

Democrats appear to have internalized the same lesson: If the MAGA movement can survive after attempting a coup, perhaps nothing can stop it. Locked out of power, Democrats at the national level can barely muster outrage against Trump, and have proved unable to rally popular opposition to his agenda or articulate a credible alternative.

I’ve been home only a few times since I left the country. Each visit feels worse than the last, either because things actually are getting worse, or because distance has sharpened my vision. January 6 really did change everything—just not in the way I’d hoped.</div>

I don&#39;t bother with romance novels (they&#39;re usually about abusers being rewarded for being abusers, and not really my cup of tea even when they aren&#39;t), but AI is not great at translation, is terrible at metaphor, and is horrific at writing.

If they&#39;re going to use AI for auto-translation, then I think the best thing they can do is pay for the first 30 sessions of therapy needed afterwards.

I wouldn&#39;t call myself bilingual, but my experience is that there are lots of nuances that an author imbues their work with, based on choosing various turns of phrase. Learning to see, understand and translate the author&#39;s intent is a learned skill. I question whether AI is yet capable of discerning the author&#39;s intent.

My work uses AI to transcribe meetings. It has frequent mistakes, which nobody notices because nobody that attended the meeting looks at the minutes immediately after the meeting.

And we see similar problems with translation software. It makes an error, and with no human willing to proofread it, errors slip in. And it&#39;s not like a simple typo, it can be totally strange nonsense.

When you use AI to drive both the cost and quality of your products to zero. Don&#39;t be surprised if consumers stop showing up to buy

While sad. THis is not new for most palces.

In the 80s/90s I was only ever asked to reasd specific chapters. Yes I read the entire book,. but I was not asked to.

Maybe it&#39;s just a US thing? But I doubt US had better requirements for the last 40 years.

But this was also a rural area in Tennessee in the 80s - there were also illiterate kids who attended until 16 when they could drop out and work on a farm.

In the 80s/90s we were tasked to read several novels from grade school through high school; The Incredible Journey, Where the Red Fern Grows, In the Heat of the Night, The Hobbit, 1984, To Kill a Mockingbird, Romeo and Juliet are some that I remember reading for school. I know Lord of the Flies, Animal Farm, and Farenheit 451 were also on the curriculum as friends took those in other blocks. And those are just the ones I recall... there were others.

Before I noticed that, I never really got that &quot;reading a whole book&quot; is kind of separate skill from &quot;just reading&quot;.

But recent years I often met people who said &quot;I can not read a whole book&quot;, instead of &quot;I do not like reading books&quot;.

What we need is more social programs. We need more anti whatever training because kids are disproportionally affected by something or another. The overweight kids need more food because obviously they are starving or something. And also, more after school programs and later start times for schools because reasons. For all this, we need more administration and testing for our students so that we can know more about what they aren&#39;t learning in pretty reports and stuff. And tech, we need more distracting tech

> Rather, teens are given excerpts of books, and they often read them not in print but on school-issued laptops, according to a survey of 2,000 teachers, students and parents by the New York Times.

There is still nothing like a paper book. For me, enjoyment of reading comes with immersion. For that I have to disconnect from distractions. Ebooks are convenient but laptops are a mistake. I personally struggle to read for hours on a screen, but time just flies if I browse a

When I was in school, many decades ago. Instead of reading English literature from a complete novel, we had text books that had excerpts from several books. So instead of reading all of Great Expectations, we&#39;d read what amounted to a single scene, not even a full chapter. Then have to do assignments based on that snippet. I think roughly 30 minutes out of a 45 minute class was given to reading, sometimes the whole class but usually what the teacher called &quot;silent reading&quot; (that is, the kids need to STFU).

... a belief that students have shorter attention spans ...Dear Educational System: It was YOUR FUCKING JOB to make SURE that students had either sufficiently long attention spans, or skills to cope with shorter attention spans. As one who suffers from ADHD and still has always been able to read and enjoy even long, complex novels, I tell you that you get ZERO respect or tolerance from me for caving in like this.... an anthology approach to literature rather than requiring complete books.Of course - because that literature has all those inconvenient EXTRA WORDS that the writers put in even though they weren&#39;t needed. /sarc  Has it ever occurred to you that many of the lessons to be learned from literature aren&#39;t in the stories, but rather in the sentence structure, chapter structure, style, and word-play? If you&#39;re going to do that &#39;summary&#39; shit, why bother with summaries at all? Why not just have AI make a movie? After all, that&#39;s where all this bullshit is heading anyway, isn&#39;t it?School shouldn&#39;t be simply a glorified babysitting service - but if that&#39;s what you&#39;re going to make it, then just drop the pretense and explicitly transform K-12 schools into daycare. It will be a lot cheaper and a lot less confusing, and the &#39;students&#39; will be no less competent and no less capable of original thought than they are from your current campaign of stupefaction.If &quot;children are the future&quot;, then given current educational practices we are SO fucked...

Overworked and underpaid teachers can only do so much. A lot of the problem lies with parents raising their children in front of iPad screens. Nowadays teachers can&#39;t even fail or discipline students or else the parents threaten lawsuits or even physical violence. The admins don&#39;t stand behind the teachers either. Simply not worth it anymore.

The last ones were far from slim, and the sold millions of copies.

Just give ladies the monster porn smut and dudes the litRPG stuff and suddenly they&#39;re all reading the novels again.

Many teachers are secret revolutionaries and still assign whole books

Many teachers are secret revolutionaries and still assign whole books Well, that&#39;s dystopian.  Holy crap.Yeah, that sentence hit me hard too. I know it&#39;s trendy to let ADHD have full reign, but god damn if you have to be a secret revolutionary AS A TEACHER to assign full books. And we wonder why we&#39;re falling behind on the world stage?

Why should I rely on my neighbor&#39;s cow for my milk? I&#39;m going to buy my own cow, and milk it myself.  Anyone know how to milk a cow?

Over-reliance on an unreliable source is stupid.

Britain has plenty of brilliant minds and is more than capable of building services equal, or superior, to those in the US. It honestly isn&#39;t hard - I&#39;ve worked in the US tech sector and their minds are nowhere near up to scratch. Those that are are overworked, underpaid, and essentially beholden to their employer because the US is a &quot;good ol&#39; boy&#39;s club&quot; where executives abuse power and authority on a regular basis. This is not a good way to run a reliable, c

Here&#39;s the problem: if you stop relying on my cow, then the rest of my family here in my house, might start thinking they are allowed to get their milk elsewhere, too, thereby avoiding all the mind-altering drugs that I have been secretly putting in the milk to control everyone. Stop poisoning my family&#39;s minds with this subversive &quot;use a different cow&quot; talk!

If UK and EU citizens don&#39;t have to use our data-hungry and ad-barking servers, then US citizens might get the same idea! Surely you can see why that&#39;s

Democrats fault for Trump voters, not the actual Trump voters.

It&#39;s the media and you can listen to Trump supporters literally say they much prefer their media provide them words that make them feel good rather than what is true or accurate.

Trump has complete dominance over conservative media and conservative media is dominant across the country.  Any accusations of &quot;mainstream liberal media&quot; is gaslighting at this point.

It&#39;s pretty obvious Trump isn&#39;t planning on having an election in 4 years.Put down the Crack pipe.

It&#39;s pretty obvious Trump isn&#39;t planning on having an election in 4 years.

..cutting off any reliance on the USA as soon as possible is a good idea. After all, unreliable components should be replaced.

I only wonder what will be financially left of MS, Alfabet, Meta, etcetera when ther only consumers are in the USA.

Cut off any reliance on the USA, and you will be tariffied

Hey Europe, make your own competitors, and then the question will be..

I only wonder what will be financially left of MS, Alfabet, Meta, etcetera when ther only consumers are in the USA.

..why should US consumers use these services?

One that has already telegraphed a strong desire to push Europe into fascism but also abandon it.

Trump/Vance and the surrounding machine is gleefully shitting on the international order, and while it will be disastrous for the US long-term, it is a very real short-term threat now.

Yes, the pigs all squeal when you take away their slop.

I don&#39;t care what side of the political spectrum anyone is on, the fact remains that politics is volatile and tribal, the companies handling the hosting and services are grossly mismanaged and incompetent, and we cannot guarantee that transatlantic connectivity is safe or secure.

Mind you, it&#39;s hard to guarantee anything in the UK is safe or secure, either, with politicians continuing to act like nutters in their obsession to read other people&#39;s emails and dictate who is and is not permitted to access a VPN.

https://www.washingtonpost.com... [washingtonpost.com]

Start with Britain, where &quot;grossly offensive&quot; communications can be a police matter. In 2023, British police made [parliament.uk] more than 12,000 arrests under two [legislation.gov.uk] communications statutes [legislation.gov.uk]. For comparison, during America’s first Red Scare, from 1919 to 1920, one of the worst crackdowns on speech in the nation’s history, the United States averaged about 2,000 arrests per year [uh.edu], when the U.S. population [census.gov] was more than 50 percent bigger [worldometers.info] than Britain’s today.

IIRC, the printer division is a completely separate company [reuters.com] these days.

The computer company has its issues, but nothing like the shit show that is the printer company.

HPe is servers, networking, enterprise software that manages the servers or the network, and the like.

HP without-the-e is the printers, desktops, calculators, printer ink, and related business practices involving breaking kneecaps for using unapproved ink cartridges.

Still, it could be worse. It could be Dymo.

I don&#39;t know that there is a &#39;good&#39; HP anymore...

Some of the bad HP&#39;s non consumer stuff, like Z workstations, aren&#39;t that bad. They can&#39;t peddle rubbish to IT departments as easily as they do to customers in places like PC World.

In the case of this, the experiment will be done. If it works well, better ones will come along. This one looks like it has a terrible keyboard: unlike Thinkpad T&#39;s, which are lovely, this thing doesn&#39;t look like a keyboard I&#39;d like to do much with. So I&#39;d plug another keyboard into it to work, which is silly. But that&#39;s kind of

Yeah, what use is a keyboard without a screen?

Unless it switches to a &#39;dumb&#39; keyboard for a phone, letting you post to Slashdot on the go!

This is probably aimed more at corporate where they want to provide desktop PCs that users won&#39;t take home but don&#39;t want to fork out for a proper one, instead hope most people won&#39;t fancy taking a keyboard home in their bag.

I suppose the key point would have to be some price advantage for not including a display, touchpad, hinge, and a smaller battery than usual laptop.  I&#39;m skeptical, especially now where RAM costs likely make the rest of all of that a rounding error....

I suppose one *could* argue that use with an external monitor would be less awkward.  Using a PC with external monitor as your focus can be pretty weird, and generally it&#39;s easier to have a separate keyboard which is more desk space.

It&#39;s less wasteful as you don&#39;t need to throw out a whole display when the hardware is outdated.  Plus no need for a battery.  As long as you don&#39;t need computing on the go and just need to play musical chairs in the office, it could be a nice solution.  Hopefully the storage is an m2 drive that can just be swapped between keyboards when the time comes for a compute refresh.

I still have a Vic-20 in my garage.  Maybe I should get it back out!

My TI-99/4a is in a tub in the back of a closet.

Would take a stack of adapters to get it working with a flat screen, I think.

That was my first thought, with the revival of Commodore and the new C64U, as well as other retro platforms&#39; efforts, it feels like HP is trying to ride the wave.

This is, idea-wise a Raspberry Pi 400 (and yes, a VIC-20, A C64, a TRS-80, a TI-99/44, an Atari 800XL, an Amiga 1200...).

What I wanna know is whether HP brings back B. Dalton and Egghead so you can get programs on cassette tape!

VIC-20 had 20KB ROM.   So I guess this is the HP-2000000000 .

The device can be configured with up to 64GB of DDR5 RAM and 2TB of SSD storage. Oh, so this will be a $1,800 keyboard.

And a keyboard is a wearing part and prone to damage...
Exactly this. Just pitch the whole thing in the trash when a keyswitch goes bad. The absolute ultimate in disposable gear.

Pulling a good mobo from a bad keyboard would be easier than detaching a good screen from a bad laptop.

When a C64 breaks it is usually not the keyboard. And those are more than 40 years old.

Is &quot;hot desking&quot; just a sort of variation on the open office theme that (afaik) basically everyone HATED?

I recognize that my case is not necessarily universal, but I&#39;m genuinely curious if anyone has this at their workplace and likes it, or at least finds it useful.

Our corporate HQ in EU did the whole open office thing just before covid and frankly people were pretty angry.  No personal desks (in reality, people self-organized informally where they could expect to sit) and if you were going to have an exten

It works for the company looking to fit as many bodies in as little area as possible.

I&#39;m just waiting for some tech company to pitch upgraded stacked mortuary cabinets as the next level of &#39;collaboratve workspace&#39;

They did that at Otellini&#39;s Intel in Chandler AZ when I was there around 2009 or so.

The round foam couches and glass cubes, 70&#39;s colors, and a new age relaxation room with two massage chairs (really).A game room with a big flat panel on the wall hooked up to a Wii as a bro detector, mostly used by the sales weasels. It always smelled in there.

Sitting in the middle of the floor, with no walls, was this massive Cisco teleconferencing system built into a curved wood veneer conference table with multiple 1080p

My company does this for the work from home crowd, when they have to come in (1-2 days in a month).

Currently we have thin clients connecting to window VMs but I see the use case for these.

Is &quot;hot desking&quot; just a sort of variation on the open office theme that (afaik) basically everyone HATED?Unfortunately, many of those in positions to force that abomination on the rest did not hate it at all.

Putting the computer in the keyboard was a cost-cutting measure and FCC emissions loophole in the 1970&#39;s and 1980&#39;s. You don&#39;t need to do that anymore.There&#39;s a reason mini-PCs have VESA mounts. And the vast majority of all-in-one computers have been built into the display, not the keyboard.

With most people using hot desks having access to a laptop. A keyboard-computer is just going to be in the way most of the time. While I can plug my laptop in my work&#39;s hot desk, and a simple monitor with two inputs woul

The only reason I can think of, especially with a lot of storage, is that the keyboards could be &quot;sticky&quot; for a person, but the monitor fixed to the desk.  I&#39;d say HP missed the mark on this one; going minimal specs and having the big stuff either with the screen or centralized would be much easier.

I like a keyboard that is easy to position and fits in a keyboard drawer for proper ergonomic height.

Who asked for this form factor?! If you really need to move a computer between workspaces (or work/home) a much more convenient form factor is just a Raspberry Pi (in a case) size (and easily achievable nowadays even in Intel/AMD world). But nobody wants that, everyone wants a laptop, that can be used by itself too without any shenanigans.

This has been tried in many forms, with Samsung&#39;s DeX (Microsoft Continuum and some other attempts earlier), Android Desktop now, whatever Apple&#39;s equivalent is too - it&#39;s

Interesting idea. Though probably a PC-in-a-dock would have been a better idea.

Keyboards (and mice) were always the most disposable parts of a PC - for a reason.

I mean, with this device, you now can spill coffee on your PC too.

Plus all the hygienic hazards. (I would never want to use keyboard/mouse of some of my colleagues.)

A cheap keyboard PC works for some folks. But what they&#39;re suggesting sounds like a rather upper-scale PC built into a keyboard. Just make it a damned laptop if you expect to sell it. Having it be an expensive, non-useable its own PC built into an inconvenient form-factor seems a non-starter in a world where PC laptops and tablets with click-on keyboards exist. It&#39;s like they&#39;re trying to invent a product for a demand that does not, and never will, exist.

Which seems completely on-point for this particular j

* Low power consumption* Lightweight* Variable keyboard sizes, but generally compact* Self-contained battery the entire computer for hours at a time* Easy plug-and-play with USB C docks* Integrated monitor

* Price: $500 - $1,500 for most business/student laptops.* Sales Pitch: A fully capable computer wherever you need to be.

What they&#39;re offering: Screenless Laptop.

* LowER power consumption than a laptop (no monitor).--- This doesn&#39;t matter though because almost no one will ever use

I, too, am dubious if there is a niche for this kind of product, but you also touched (twice) on the power topic. I think that may be a more important problem than it seems. So I&#39;ll throw this question out here:

Is anyone else noticing &quot;slow charging&quot; problems with USB C devices? In my case that&#39;s smartphones and a Chromebook. It seems to be getting worse over the months. Initially I suspected the cables, especially the connectors, but I&#39;ve swapped too many cables to support that hypothesis and I think there

I have seen tickets come through where the person has said they don&#39;t know how to plug the cable from the docking station into the side of the laptop.

No way in hell these people will be able to use this keyboard.

Looking forward to these being dumped on eBay for the cheap when the companies stupid enough to buy them realize their mistake. We have a supposed DDR5 shortage and this is where they decide to solder it in? Also, HP, nope, nope, nope.

Interesting if this could be paired with high quality VR googles.

I am a potential user - I have monitors everywhere - I am not really using my notebooks screen.

1. price - though this may not be a problem once it flops and we got plenty on ebay

2. keyboard is the part that breaks most often in my case - possibly this is HP&#39;s idea too - tie PC upgrade to the part that breaks most...

What we want is our own keyboards, especially since all HP keyboards (whether dedicated or part of a laptop) are shit. The last decent example was on the EliteBooks before they shrank them and ruined them too.

This submission is written like a puff piece for big tech.  I think it&#39;s quite easily witnessed how detrimental big tech products are to society at large.  Ask yourself: if we magically rolled back technology to 1985, would the world be worse mentally?  Yeah right.

we don&#39;t need to go back nearly that far. The internet and online commerce are generally to useful to give up anyway.

Also, with such a politically charged issue, using Texas to decide what might happen in New York is ridiculous.

Without knowing the actual language, there&#39;s no way anyone other than partisan hacks can conclude anything.

For those hoping that Gen Z would usher in a new era of progressive politics in America, the past two years have been a whipsaw. In 2024 there was great panic over young voters’ drift toward Donald Trump. But in 2025, after young voters in New York City, New Jersey, and Virginia helped deliver Democratic wins, there was a reassessment. In light of these liberal victories, many put forward amended evaluations, stating that Gen Z is both more participatory and progressive than it has been given credit for, and that concerns about Democratic erosion among young men, spurred by the influence of the “manosphere,” have been exaggerated. In fact, Gen Z was lauded for being the most progressive generation ever based on recent measures of racial attitudes from the 2024 Cooperative Election Study dataset, a nationally representative survey of over 60,000 Americans.

So which is it? Is Gen Z a bastion of progressives who are immune to the manosphere’s toxicity? Or is 2025 a blip, and is Gen Z bucking the long-running trend of younger generations moving left?

The short answer is that it’s complicated, and neither of those dueling narratives gets to the truth.

The slightly longer answer is this: According to the best available data, on issues of race, members of Gen Z are, on average, far more progressive than any of their older counterparts. But when it comes to attitudes toward gender, Gen Z members are no more progressive than the rest of us.

It’s a sobering finding with large-scale implications, both for the future of U.S. politics and for our understanding of how the first generation to grow up online is processing the modern media ecosystem.

It’s also particularly telling about the manosphere— a corner of the digital landscape that features communities dedicated to men’s issues ranging from things like self-help, dating, and fitness to explicitly misogynistic forums defined by grievances toward feminism and women. Although the manosphere content often cited by media and scholars is not necessarily racially regressive, it is distinctly gender regressive, and that appears to be taking a toll on Gen Z.

OK, those are big claims. So how do I know this? I’m an academic whose work has focused explicitly on the importance of identity in American politics—things like race, gender, and class—and how we can use surveys to understand its influence. I’m going off not just vibes here; my conclusions are based on that same 2024 survey, which, as noted, drew from more than 60,000 Americans.

Among questions in which the survey asks how much one agrees or disagrees with statements like “Generations of slavery and discrimination have created conditions that make it difficult for Blacks to work their way out of the lower class” and “Whites get away with offenses that African Americans would never get away with,” members of Gen Z are unique. Of all age groups, they show the lowest levels of what scholars call racial resentment, a standard survey index that combines multiple questions to measure racism. However, on measures of ambivalent sexism, via statements such as “Women seek to gain power by getting control over men” and “Women are too easily offended,” Gen Z–ers are strikingly no different from their grandparents. Let’s break it down.

The figure above shows that Gen Z’s level of sexism is only slightly below average, and negligibly lower than the Silent Generation’s. Sexism is measured using respondents’ level of agreement with two statements, mentioned earlier, about women seeking power over men and being too easily offended. Generational scores are then standardized so that they demonstrate how each generation compares with the overall average across all respondents in the CES. Values closer to “high” indicate groups that are more sexist than average, while values closer to “low” indicate groups that are less sexist than average.

This gender finding stands in sharp contrast to racial attitudes. Racial resentment is measured using five survey items about structural racial inequality and is also depicted relative to the overall average. On race, each older generation consistently displays higher resentment compared with the generation that succeeded it. Gen Z is notably lower than average on racial resentment.

The takeaway is not that Gen Z–ers are uniformly progressive, but that their progressivism is uneven. It is real and pronounced based on race but far more tenuous when it comes to gender.

Gen Z’s lack of progress on gender issues is all the more stark when you break down the differences in responses across genders.

One can look at how men and women across age differ in levels of racism and sexism. The first figure shows that younger generations are slightly less sexist than older generations (though this data is in no way as stark as that of racism). However, if you look at this by men and women in different generations, this slightly lower level of sexism is driven entirely by women in those generations. Men across each age group are above average in their level of sexism, and there is no generational difference in level of gender progressiveness.

These trends, unsurprisingly, differ by political party identification. Republicans exhibit the highest level of both sexism and racial resentment for all age cohorts. Interestingly, younger Republicans are actually more sexist than their elders, suggesting a potential regression in attitudes toward women across generations. This further lends support to the narrative that young people on the right are being influenced by sexist content online. Overall, Democrats and independents show rising racial progressiveness across age—but no similar generational shift on sexism.

If the narrative that Gen Z is uniquely progressive were true, we would expect Gen Z–ers to be more progressive than older generations by outright rejecting sexist statements. Older cohorts tend to hover around mild tolerance, so a genuinely more progressive generation (Gen Z Democrats included) should move decisively beyond that baseline. It doesn’t.

It is easier and more comfortable to conclude that Gen Z is pretty great and to advise people to stop panicking—to embrace a comforting narrative that the youth are here to save us. It is also reasonable to applaud reductions in racism that have taken shape over generations.

But dwelling too long on that can foster misplaced faith and ill-timed complacency.

The data reveals that concerns over young people, especially young men, are not unfounded. Gender-focused research supports the lived experience of what women already know: There is a rising tide of gender-based antagonism both online and offline. It does us no favors to conflate the important gains in racial progress among Gen Z with the real evidence of the impact of the manosphere and red-pill communities.

Beyond the findings presented here, research from scholars like Michael Tesler, John Sides, and Colette Marcellin, as well as from Melissa Deckman, supports this broader pattern of gender attitudes. According to their work, young Republicans, men and women alike, are gravitating toward traditional gender roles, and young men overall are becoming more conservative. This shows that gender attitudes broadly are an effective terrain for Republican appeals. Gender attitudes may be a bridge issue that allows the GOP to find new voters without conceding ground on other issues.

Young Republicans, the ones who are more sexist than their grandparents, are increasingly setting the tone and strategy for their party. And this new cohort has focused on reaching young voters in the media environments they already inhabit with campaign strategies that focus on entertainment-forward social media and generationally relatable messages.

In practice, this looks like using masculinity-based appeals to reach young voters, particularly in spaces that sit outside the conventional conservative-media ecosystem. From an attitudinal perspective, this strategy may be well suited to the moment. The lack of clear progress of Gen Z on gender attitudes leaves an opening in which appeals grounded in masculinity and skepticism toward feminism can resonate without triggering partisan backlash. If Republicans continue to organize their outreach around this dimension, the strategy may prove durable over time.

Over the next few decades, these attitudes toward both racism and sexism will shape not just elections, the focus of current commentary, but institutions and policy. A generation that is progressive on race but not on gender will not be able to implement a fully egalitarian society. There will be uneven progress, with movement forward on issues of racial inequality but stagnation and resistance toward inroads into gender inequality. This will manifest across institutions, producing a political world that can accommodate racial inclusion while continuing to normalize unequal gender relations in families, workplaces, and governance.

President Donald Trump’s military operation to capture Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro is flatly illegal under international law and almost certainly illegal under federal law—an unauthorized use of force against a foreign nation that pushes executive power past its breaking point. Yet there is no real chance that the courts will curb it, even as the mission evolves into a possible occupation of Venezuela and an expansion of hostilities to its neighbors. Nor is there any signal that Congress will impose restraints on what appears to be the dawn of a new conflict overseas, surrendering its constitutional war powers to Trump without objection. And even if Congress does try to assert its authority to oversee (or end) military action in South America, it will face an uphill battle in a judiciary that persistently favors the commander in chief.

This inversion of our constitutional order sets a perilous precedent that even many celebrating Maduro’s fall may come to regret. It marks the death knell of the post–World War II settlement that, however imperfect, wrestled the anarchy of war into a framework designed to condition armed aggression on legal justification. The executive branch’s consolidation of power now reverberates far beyond the United States’ shores as a saber-rattling president abandons any pretense that the law can constrain his resort to military force. Indeed, the legal theories the administration has floated to defend its actions draw on a historical source Trump once disavowed: the arch-interventionist claim that the U.S. has an inalienable right to police the world.

It is difficult to tally all the ways in which the Maduro operation was illegal, but start with a point that few dispute: This act violated international law. Trump’s invasion of Venezuela to capture its president cannot be squared with Article 2(4) of the U.N. Charter, which bars member nations from deploying “the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state.” This principle—the most important rule of international law today—should bind the United States, which ratified the charter in 1945. And it clearly prohibits the American government from invading another country to make an arrest.

Yet Mike Waltz, Trump’s ambassador to the United Nations, did not even pretend that the administration complied with Article 2(4) in his address to the U.N. Security Council on Monday. Instead, Waltz rejected the premise that this rule should apply to Venezuela at all, because Maduro was an “illegitimate narco-terrorist” and “fugitive from justice.” Of course, if a country can disregard the U.N. Charter whenever it concludes that another nation’s leaders have given up their claim to “territorial integrity or political independence,” then the charter means nothing. Arguably worse was Waltz’s insistence that Venezuela’s vast “energy reserves” also justified the action, a motive Trump has laid bare from the start. It should go without saying that the charter does not, under any circumstances, permit one nation to invade another to secure control over its natural resources.

So what is the government’s legal defense of its military incursion into Venezuela? The administration purports to be following the Panama precedent of 1989—when President George H.W. Bush ordered the military invasion of Panama to arrest its dictator, Manuel Noriega, ostensibly so he could stand trial in the U.S. But this episode was not approved by Congress (which found out just hours before) or the U.N. (which condemned it) or a federal court (which never passed on its legality). Instead, the Department of Justice’s Office of Legal Counsel justified the aggression in a secret memo signed by William Barr, who would go on to serve as attorney general for the first Bush and Trump.

In that memo, Barr claimed that the president has inherent constitutional authority to conduct extraterritorial arrests for violations of U.S. law. Even if those arrests require complex military incursions into foreign nations, he wrote, they remain within the president’s inherent powers and do not require congressional approval. Barr further asserted that these arrests did not have to comply with Article 2(4) of the U.N. Charter. That provision, he wrote, does not actually bind the executive branch because it is not “self-executing,” freeing the commander in chief to disregard it.

This conclusion was obviously wrong: Even if the charter cannot be enforced by federal courts, it remains binding on the executive branch and is a law that the president has a constitutional duty to faithfully execute. The memo was so absurd, in fact, that the DOJ did everything in its power to conceal it, as New York University law professor Ryan Goodman has documented. After Congress demanded to see Barr’s memo, the department refused, even failing to comply with a subpoena ordering its disclosure. When Barr eventually testified about its contents under oath, he omitted its assertion that the president can “override” the U.N. Charter (a legal justification that made up a mere four paragraphs). The Clinton administration finally released the memo in 1993, and in the years since, legal experts have derided it as “deeply counterintuitive and indefensible,” “fundamentally flawed,” “preposterous,” and utterly “bereft of citation to supporting authority.”

But embrace, for a moment, the nihilism of Barr’s memo and assume that international law imposes no legitimate constraints on the president’s use of force. Even then, Trump’s actions in Venezuela would still be illegal—or, most generously, an egregious distortion of the constitutional war powers. It is Congress, after all, that has the authority to declare war and must authorize use of military force. The president is the commander in chief, the civilian leader of the armed forces, but he holds no independent power to commence hostilities. Needless to say, Congress has neither declared war on Venezuela nor authorized military force within its borders.

From where, then, did Trump derive authority to invade Venezuela? As Harvard Law professor Jack Goldsmith has explained, the administration evidently contrived it from its desire to arrest Maduro on federal charges. The logic goes like this: The DOJ sought to take the dictator into custody on charges of drug trafficking. It could do so only by storming Venezuela. That operation would require protection from the military. And as a matter of “unit self-defense,” these accompanying troops had a right to bomb, shoot, and otherwise overwhelm any threats to the mission through lethal force. This rationale is quintessential bootstrapping: The alleged goal of trying Maduro in the U.S. gives Trump permission to launch a hostile incursion into a sovereign nation, whose ramifications may well give rise to a broader regional conflict.

Georgetown Law professor and Slate contributor Steve Vladeck has laid out the danger of this shameless maneuver: It subverts the constitutional order by allowing the president to set off offensive military operations under the pretext of carrying out an arrest warrant on foreign soil. If troops face any resistance, they can escalate with further use of force, sliding quickly toward war—all without authorization from the legislative branch. So the Trump administration’s apparent rationale is less of a loophole than a complete end run around Congress’ war powers with no limiting principle in sight.

Despite all this, no one seriously thinks that any federal court will slow or stop Trump’s attacks in Venezuela and its neighbors. Americans seem to have consigned ourselves to the reality that legal constraints on the commander in chief’s operational decisions are entirely theoretical, with no meaningful mechanism for enforcement. Congress has handed over to the president more and more of its authority over foreign affairs. The Supreme Court has persistently forbidden federal judges from second-guessing the executive branch’s use of military force. (That’s why the Trump administration’s legal defense comes not from a court decision but from a self-serving opinion produced by the Department of Justice.) And the rest of the world has no means to secure accountability for the United States, which does not even recognize the jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court.

So Trump, already a “unitary executive” at home, becomes a kind of ersatz emperor abroad, bound by no law of nations, no treaty or charter, no checks but those he elects to honor. The post–World War II consensus, as enshrined in the U.N. Charter, rejected this kind of unbridled aggression as an invitation to perpetual conflict. Trump, in turn, rejects that consensus. It may be tempting to ignore the consequences of this radical new doctrine when it is wielded against an illegitimate dictator like Maduro. But Trump is already threatening action against Colombia, Cuba, Iran, and even Mexico, a liberal democracy with a legitimately elected president. The end point, it seems, is whatever this president says it is. That theory of American dominance does not merely push legal limits. It subordinates law to the logic of conquest.

            <h2>This Isn’t a Regime Change</h2>

            <a class="original-link" href="https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2026/01/venezuela-regime-change-maduro-trump-rubio-oil.html?via=rss">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">On Saturday morning, in what the Trump administration dubbed Operation Absolute Resolve, Delta Force commandos entered the compound of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro and extracted him from his own country. They took his wife too, and killed dozens of Venezuelans in their path.

Members of the administration say this was about accountability. Attorney General Pam Bondi says Maduro is about to face the “full wrath of American justice.” She alleges he’s been running Venezuela as a narco-state.

Shane Harris, a staff writer covering national security and intelligence at the Atlantic, says the administration’s actions are not surprising. Since September, the United States has been obliterating fishing boats off Venezuela’s coast and calling it a drug war.

The logic behind Maduro’s extradition is equally hard to explain. And Harris doesn’t want to call it a regime change. The regime remains in place: The vice president is now the interim president.

“That’s still the regime,” he says. “And now I think the United States is not running Venezuela, as President Trump said they were going to do. I think that the United States is essentially holding Venezuela at gunpoint and saying to the new interim president, You’re going to do what we want and govern the country according to these demands, or you’re going to face consequences.”

On a recent episode of What Next, host Mary Harris tries to answer a few of the bigger questions about what just went down in Venezuela. This transcript has been edited and condensed for clarity.

Mary Harris: I think some people would look at what’s happened over the weekend and say, “Oh, are we at war with Venezuela?” So are we?

Shane Harris: No. Look, we’ve taken hostile action against Venezuela. Could Venezuela say we’re at war with them? Sure. Yes. We invaded their country. I mean, we violated their territorial sovereignty. But Congress has not declared war.

Marco Rubio, the secretary of state, says this is primarily a law-enforcement action because members of the FBI were there to serve papers to Maduro. That is not normal, right?

No, that’s not normal. In the most technical sense, the mission that occurred over Caracas was the Department of Justice issuing an arrest warrant on the president of Venezuela and his wife, escorted by the U.S. military. That’s one hell of an escort. So, sure, in a very narrow, technical sense that is true, but that obviously obscures the reality of what happened here.

What I thought was interesting about the whole law-enforcement-operation framing of this was that Donald Trump was not reading from that script when he was briefing reporters. And in many ways, he seemed to go off script. He talked about this as removing a corrupt dictator and getting Venezuela to pay back what was stolen—to use his words—from the United States in terms of oil and oil revenues. And you could see, both in the other officials who were briefing and in Rubio’s comments on the Sunday shows, an effort to try to walk this back and frame it a bit more narrowly. But the president does what he often does, which is he goes off script. He gets grandiose in his explanations. And that points to the fact that there is no coherent strategy for what is happening right now.

My understanding of things is that Maduro was offered the opportunity to go into exile in Turkey. And he was like, “Oh, thank you.” And they’re like, “All right, we’re coming to get you.” So there were clearly weeks of, if not negotiation, discussion or raising of stakes.

From our reporting and that of other journalist colleagues, the administration wanted him to leave peacefully, go into this kind of gilded exile, as it has been described. The question remains, then: Who was going to replace him? Who would come next? And that seems to be the part that they haven’t quite figured out yet.

There were those clearly within the anti-Maduro camp, both in the administration and publicly, who wanted to see him go and be replaced with possibly the person who everyone agrees actually won the election for president in 2024, Edmundo González, or even with María Corina Machado, the Nobel Prize winner who has been such a huge force for democracy and activism in Venezuela.

Machado was banned from running, so she ran someone else in her stead, but it was sort of as if a vote for him was a vote for her. But Machado has been thanking Trump. She’s very deferential to him, clearly aiming for this goal of “OK, and I’ll take over.” But that’s not what happened.

It’s not what happened, and he was quite dismissive of Machado in his comments in Florida this weekend, essentially saying that she doesn’t have the respect in Venezuela, that there’s not really support for her. This is a very strange argument for him to make. And I think it’s a false argument because everybody agrees, including people in the Trump administration, that González, the candidate who essentially ran in her stead, won by a healthy margin. He is actually the legitimately elected leader of Venezuela. The United States has been saying that for months and months now. So why, then, is the person to replace Maduro his own vice president? Why are you sticking with the same regime?

The vice president, Delcy Rodríguez, got in front of cameras and was basically like, “Maduro is our president, and these people are trying to take our oil.” She doesn’t seem to be a pliant member of Team America here.

Yeah, at least not outwardly. We do have to hold open the possibility that there’s been some behind-the-scenes discussions. There has been reporting that she was in conversations with people in the Trump administration, saying, “If Maduro goes, I can take over, and maybe we can work something out.”

She’s known for straightening out the oil industry in Venezuela, making sure they could make money off it. Doesn’t she have a kind of tangled personal history and reasons not to maybe want to have this American oversight?

She is in the mold of Hugo Chávez and Maduro. This is not somebody who is the pro-democracy, pro-America kind of figure that we would expect to see in some of the other alternatives. She has impressed people in the West and in the U.S. and the administration as a competent technocrat. She is somebody we can do business with. That is how the Trump administration sees her.

What do you think is going to happen in Venezuela now? Who is in charge, and what does that mean for the actual people of Venezuela?

The next step—and this is what we should be watching for in the next couple of days—is some kind of signal or statement from Rodríguez about whether she is willing to negotiate with the U.S. [Editor’s note: Following the taping of this episode, Rodríguez issued a statement on Instagram, including this message: “We invite the US government to collaborate with us on an agenda of cooperation oriented towards shared development within the framework of international law to strengthen lasting community coexistence.”] Rubio has been very clear on behalf of the administration in laying out the demands and what he wants to see action on. And so now we will see if she can at least pay lip service to that in the coming days. I think that will go a long way toward lowering the temperature.

If she continues to be defiant—and, in the way that she was right after Maduro was captured, saying, “He is the legitimate president, we demand that he be brought back right now, we will not be colonized by anyone”—then you’re going to see that temperature raise back up, and that’s going to increase the likelihood that Trump will use military force again. What that looks like afterward I’m not even sure the administration knows. I’m not sure they’re thinking that far ahead.

Two days after the U.S. military action that forced Nicolás Maduro out of power and into a New York courthouse, two big questions remain: What happens next in Venezuela—specifically, who’s in charge? And, related to that: Who’s in charge of U.S. foreign policy?

At his Saturday press conference, where he announced the nabbing of Maduro, President Donald Trump said—to widespread astonishment—that the United States will soon “run,” or even is now “running,” Venezuela.

The next morning, on NBC’s Meet the Press, in an only slightly less baffling moment, Marco Rubio, Trump’s secretary of state and national security adviser, backpedaled on his boss’s claim. Asked whether the U.S. will really run Venezuela, Rubio replied, “Yeah, I keep [seeing] people fixating on that.” He continued: “The bottom line is, we expect to see changes in Venezuela. … It’s not running the—it’s running policy, the policy with regards to this. We want Venezuela to move in a certain direction” that would be “good for the people of Venezuela … [and] in our national interest.”

First, there should be no mystery why people are “fixating” on Trump’s claim. It’s because, in the course of his Saturday press conference, the president said 12 times that he and a group of his choosing, including Rubio himself, would “run” Venezuela.

Second, there is a distinction between running a foreign country and influencing its direction, even when this influence stems from a U.S. naval armada that remains off Venezuelan shores and an explicit threat from Trump to send in a second, larger wave of U.S. troops to enforce our influence.

Hence the question: Who is running American foreign policy—the president or his chief foreign policy adviser?

The question isn’t trivial. First, the answer will shape what happens next in Venezuela—who governs, to whose benefit, and with what level of internal freedom and stability? Second, it could shape what lessons other countries—friends and foes—take from Operation Absolute Resolve, the quite large and impressive military action that unfolded in the wee hours on Saturday. Will Russian President Vladimir Putin see the claim of unabashed regional imperialism as a winking green light to his claim of control over Ukraine? Will Chinese President Xi Jinping infer the same about his claims over Taiwan? Will the mullahs of Tehran take it as grounds for fear of an impending U.S. attack? How seriously will Cuba’s leaders take Trump’s—and Rubio’s—warnings that as goes Caracas will soon go Havana, whether by U.S. attack or self-immolation?

Given the regional and global stakes, one might think that Trump and his team would have worked out a unified message to explain and justify this audacious (to say the least) military action. Instead, this is just another case in point that Trump’s actions often have no underlying strategy—which is to say, no clear idea of how to link means and ends: or, in this case, just what the desired ends are.

Some of those ends are clear, as Trump laid out on Saturday and as neither Rubio nor any of the other officials flanking him contradicted: the desire for sole domination of the Western Hemisphere (as had been spelled out in his National Security Strategy document) and the desire for control of its oil and the wealth it produces.

Leaving aside the wisdom and legality of those goals, the press conference and Rubio’s subsequent caveat made clear that the administration has not thought through just how to obtain them—i.e., it’s clear they have no strategy.

If Trump is serious about “running” Venezuela, how, and through what agent, does he plan to do this? He said that Maduro’s former deputy, Delcy Rodríguez, who has now been sworn in as his interim successor, was an acceptable intermediary, and that Rubio is working with her. (Rodríguez herself, a longtime fiery Maduro associate who at first denounced the abduction, has since said she’s willing to “collaborate” with the U.S. to redevelop her country, though added, perhaps wishfully, that she wouldn’t let it become a U.S. colony.)

The same question applies if Rubio’s slightly less coercive notion of merely influencing the country’s policy applies. Maduro’s ministers remain in charge; the Venezuelan military retains ultimate power, offering security and oppression, assisted by at least 20,000 Cubans, many officers and some health care workers who have provided health care in exchange for Venezuelan oil. Will the military now be swayed toward northern-leaning sentiments, given the evaporation of the wages that Maduro provided and the continuing blockade of the country’s oil for as long as they refuse to budge? Some insiders were apparently bought off during the planning of the incursion. The CIA had recruited at least one person close to Maduro to keep track of his movements; it’s reasonable to assume that wasn’t the only spy.

And what about the democratic opposition? Trump shoved aside any role in a new government for María Corina Machado, the movement’s leader, saying, “She doesn’t have respect in the country.” And he said nothing about the leader of her party, Edmundo González Urrutia, who legitimately won the 2024 election and who fled in exile to Spain after Maduro, who was soundly defeated, held on to power. Machado, who won the Nobel Peace Prize for her valiant struggle (perhaps to the bitterness of Trump, who many times said he deserved it), issued a statement, calling on Urrutia to be brought back to lead the country. Will the democrats on the streets and elsewhere second her demands, or will they simply bow down to the continued reign of Maduro’s team just because it will now be tempered a bit by influence from Washington and the big oil companies?

This too has broader implications. The United States cannot easily claim to be leader of “the free world,” or even a champion of democracy, if it ousts a dictator—a feat that many Venezuelans cheer—but then does nothing to help restore the real, freely elected president.

There is also something a bit fishy about the official rationale for the military operation, which was to bring a criminal fugitive to justice, given that the U.S. extracted him through means that were likely in violation of international law. Yes, a U.S. grand jury indicted Maduro for drug smuggling back in 2020, and in the wake of his abduction this weekend, the Justice Department filed additional charges—most of them legitimate. (I say “most,” rather than “all,” because one of them, possession of a machine gun, seems an odd charge to level against a foreign head of state, however illegitimate he might be.)

Which leads to one more broad point. The United States has had a pretty successful record of overthrowing foreign leaders but a pretty lousy one of imposing order, or accomplishing whatever outcomes it has desired, in the aftermath. (Some obvious cases in point: Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya, Guatemala, and—going back several decades but one with enormous implications later on and ever since—Iran.)

A reporter at Saturday’s press conference asked Trump about this mixed record with previous presidents. His reply was evasive to say the least:

With me, that’s not true. With me, we’ve had a perfect track record of winning. … If you look at [the assassination of Qasem] Soleimani, you look at [Abu Bakr] al-Baghdadi, you look at the Midnight Hammer [the air raid on Iranian nuclear targets] … we have essentially peace in the Middle East because of that. … So, with me, you’ve had a lot of victory. You’ve had only victories, you’ve had no losses.

There are several disturbing things about this passage, quite aside from the fact that “peace in the Middle East” remains, in many ways, aspirational. The most pertinent here is that Trump seems to believe that a dramatic tactically successful strike—the killing of a terrorist leader, the bombing of a nascent nuclear facility, the signing of a multiphase 20-point peace treaty (but the accomplishment of just the first phase), and now the extraction of a horrible dictator—amounts to a strategic victory and the fulfillment of an ambitious policy.

Trump doesn’t think he has to care about what happens next in Venezuela or what he needs to do to make it happen, to improve the odds of success or reduce the odds of catastrophe, however those terms are defined.

In Operation Absolute Resolve, the U.S. military showed itself to be, as it has several times in recent years, an agile, effective, supremely coordinated instrument of national power. Whose resolve it enforces, to what ends, is another matter. The policymaking machinery at the top of America’s power structure is appallingly adrift.

            <div id="article-text">Not even Legos are safe from the inexorable march of smart technology, as the Danish construction toy stalwart introduced a new tech-in-a-brick Smart Play system at CES this week.

Lego brick sets based around Smart Bricks will be packed with things like light and motion sensors, a speaker, lights, a wirelessly rechargeable battery and other components. According to Lego, that means builds that include a four-by-two Smart Brick are able to &quot;react uniquely depending on how it&#39;s moved, twisted, and turned.&quot;

&quot;You might hear our SMART Brick roaring like a jet plane or flushing like a toilet,&quot; Lego explained in a rundown of how the system could work.

There&#39;s a catch, though: Smart Bricks don&#39;t do a darn thing unless they&#39;re placed close to an accompanying Smart Minifigure or flat 2-by-2 sized Smart Tag, both of which appear, based on an image shared by Lego, to have some form of NFC chip in them.

Lego explained that it chose to design its own internal hardware for the Smart Play system instead of relying on an existing design, resulting in a &quot;bespoke, silicon ASIC chip&quot; for Smart Play that is &quot;smaller than just one standard Lego stud and highly specialized to the task.&quot;

As explained in Lego&#39;s blog posts, tags can do things like tell a Smart Brick that it&#39;s now part of an aircraft, boat, or other vehicle, or that it&#39;s attached to the back of a dinosaur or animal. They&#39;re also embedding the chips into Smart Minifigures, which are like the standard Lego people and characters, but programmed with their own personalities.

&quot;Each Smart Minifigure reacts differently to the world around them,&quot; Lego explained, &quot;through their own sounds, moods and reactions, which are played back to you via the SMART Brick.&quot;

Put a nervous minifigure on a spaceship, and they might freak out, Lego said.

&quot;Every SMART Play Minifigure reacts uniquely to any given play scenario,&quot; the company added.

Of course, this being the modern era of Lego, a new product launch wouldn&#39;t be complete without licensing it out to a brand, and what Lego-licensed IP is more recognizable than Star Wars?

Sure, kids will eventually be able to build Smart Brick-enabled cars, airplanes, and dinosaurs. For now, however, they&#39;ll be exclusively able to play with Smart Legos in a galaxy far, far away.

Three Smart Play sets were announced at CES: Darth Vader&#39;s TIE Fighter, Luke Skywalker&#39;s X-Wing, and Emperor Palpatine&#39;s Throne Room, which also comes with an A-Wing. Smart tags in the trio of kits include the aforementioned craft, along with lightsaber duel sounds, an Imperial laser turret, transport ship, R2-D2, and the like. Darth Vader, Luke Skywalker, Emperor Palpatine, and Princess Leia Smart Minifigures all feature, too, naturally.

The sets will be available for preorder beginning January 9, and will start shipping in March.

Lego bricks with onboard custom ASICs seem like a builder&#39;s dream come true – especially with Lego&#39;s professed goal of encouraging open-ended play. Given that, it would seem natural for Lego to release some kind of development kit for the Smart Play system to enable advanced Lego lovers to design their own Smart Tags and Minifigures.

Alas, nothing like that has been announced so far.

For now, Lego is foregoing unlimited user creativity in favor of releasing Star Wars-branded sets – when I was a kid I had nothing but a bunch of random multi-colored bricks and the imagination to build my own starships, this aging Vulture screams while shaking his fist.

The only clue to the future of what DIY enthusiasts can expect from Lego Smart Play comes in the form of a cryptic statement at the end of a press release. &quot;LEGO SMART Play™ will continue to expand through new updates, launches and technology – with the LEGO Group set to reveal more additions in the future.&quot; ®

            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2026/01/06/loss32_crazy_or_inspired/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">What if, rather than make a Linux distro that can run Windows apps, you built the whole distro around Windows binaries instead?

Loss32 is the most gleefully deranged idea for how to put together a Linux OS that we think we have ever read about in three and a half decades… but it&#39;s not impossible. Not only could it be done, there could be real advantages to doing it this way.

The idea comes from a blogger and developer known as Hikari no Yume (&quot;Dream of Light&quot; in Japanese) who made it public at the 39th Chaos Communication Congress in Germany at the end of December.

The gist of the idea is to run the whole user environment, desktop and all, inside WINE. So it&#39;s something like a bare-metal WINE sitting on top of the Linux kernel, with just enough plumbing to connect them up. This is significantly different from the current way, which is to run a completely Linux-based stack – the kernel, an init, a userland, a Linux display system, and a Linux desktop, and then run Windows programs inside that.

Nor is it just &quot;a Linux that can run Windows apps.&quot; That&#39;s an old idea – it was the concept behind the Lindows distribution some 25 years ago, although the name got the company sued by Microsoft. Lindows became Linspire became Freespire, which is, unexpectedly, still around, and the included Click&#39;n&#39;Run Warehouse was pretty much the first app store on the web. There was also an effort to add direct support for Windows binaries to the Linux kernel, called Longene, over a decade ago.

It&#39;s also a profoundly different approach to emulating the entire Windows OS, as the ReactOS project is inching toward. It&#39;s been working on that for quite some time now: The Register first mentioned it in 2012, as far as we can see. It also reminds us of the Neptune OS project we covered in 2022, which is still in development.

It could be made to work. Even ReactOS itself considered a comparable approach. It&#39;s even possible to run WINE on Windows itself to restore compatibility with 16-bit Windows binaries, and there are efforts to make that easier such as BoxedWine.

Long before WINE itself was useful, Sun offered WABI – Oracle still has the manual [PDF]. Sun proposed making the Win16 API a formal standard. Later, Caldera offered a Linux version of WABI, and this vulture tried it. It worked remarkably well, and let us successfully install and run MS Office 4.3 under Linux with no VMs – or Windows licenses – involved. You can see some modern screenshots on VirtuallyFun.

Linux in 2026 is better at running Windows apps than it&#39;s ever been before, to the extent that there is mass-market consumer hardware sold for this, with an Arch-based distro whose selling point is its ability to run Windows games smoothly and well, and more such hardware is coming soon.

Much of this is down to the growing maturity of WINE, but it&#39;s not just WINE. Valve is sponsoring a lot of the work, including its Proton layer for running Windows games on Linux. You can check what will work and how well on ProtonDB. The forthcoming Steam Frame headset is Arm64-powered, but is designed to run x86-64 Windows games, thanks to FEX. A notable website aimed at this market, PCGamer.com, went on the record:

I&#39;m brave enough to say it: Linux is good now, and if you want to feel like you actually own your PC, make 2026 the year of Linux on (your) desktop.

There are quite a lot of layers to unpack behind the ideas in the Loss32 proposal. The name is, of course, a pun on the name of the original Windows native API, Win32. The name &quot;Loss,&quot; and the project&#39;s logo, also refer to the famed episode of that name from the long-running Ctrl+Alt+Del web comic. This installment itself became a meme.

One of perhaps the less obvious inspirations is a widely discussed blog post from 2022, titled &quot;Win32 is the only stable ABI on Linux.&quot; This is a long-running joke in the Linux world, in the spirit of an ironic commentary on Linux compatibility over time. The kernel ABI itself is highly stable, and Linus Torvalds is notorious for defending this, but when you layer other components on top, it gets a lot more complicated. Even the lowest-level components: in the late 1990s, the transition from libc version 5 to libc 6, known as glibc, was a thorny issue and led to compatibility problems between distros that took about a decade and a half to subside.

Will Loss32 happen? It&#39;s too soon to say. Some people love the idea, some hate it, and some feel both, which we totally understand. But the bits are there. You could even boot such a Frankensteinian OS direct from NTFS – that&#39;s been possible for half a decade. Should it happen? That&#39;s a different question, but now that the challenge has been made, it may just be a matter of time. ®

            <div id="article-text">For many, the start of a new year is a time to take stock. For Microsoft, it was a time to stop giving it as the company kicked off 2026 with a bug that broke Excel&#39;s StockHistory function.

A Register reader reported the problem to us over the weekend. It also turned up on social media and in Microsoft&#39;s feedback forums.

The function, which usually returns data about a stock, began returning connection errors. We suspect checking a financial position was the last thing on the minds of many over Christmas, but as the problem dragged on into the New Year, more users found themselves faced with an &quot;unable to connect&quot; error.

The problem affected both the web and desktop versions of Microsoft&#39;s spreadsheet application and, according to affected users, has happened before. &quot;It&#39;s down at least twice a year,&quot; grumbled one customer, who said their Microsoft 365 subscription was paid purely to gain access to the feature.

The StockHistory function data is provided by LSEG Data & Analytics, though it&#39;s not immediately clear where the problem lay. A Microsoft spokesperson confirmed the receipt of our question, but did not provide any further details. A support chat posted on Reddit suggested that the problem was down to a &quot;known bug,&quot; which was scant comfort to users expecting the data to be flowing as the first day of trading got underway.

After several days, functionality was restored. However, this was not before users began seeking alternatives. After all, the market tends to move faster than the time it takes Microsoft to deal with whatever has broken.

Microsoft has had a torrid few years when it comes to the reliability of its software, regularly introducing new and exciting ways for code to fail in almost every update. Kicking off 2026 with a broken Excel function that leaves the carefully crafted spreadsheets of stock watchers borked is therefore par for the course.

One of the company&#39;s New Year&#39;s Resolutions is to persuade its customers that AI output is more than just slop. Any hopes that another might be to make its software a little less fragile have sadly already been dashed. ®

            <h2>No membrane in sight as Osmos diffuses into Microsoft Fabric</h2>
            <p><strong>The Register | 2026-01-06</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2026/01/06/microsoft_acquires_osmos/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Microsoft has bought Osmos, an AI-assisted data engineering platform, in a bid to enrich its Fabric data platform, encroaching on so-called partners&#39; markets.

Founded in 2019, Osmos was already making its pipeline and upload products available on Fabric, based around open source Apache Spark.

In a blog post, Bogdan Crivat, Microsoft corporate veep for Azure Data Analytics, said the purchase will support Fabric&#39;s mission to give customers an approach to &quot;unify all data and analytics into a single, secure platform.&quot;

&quot;With the acquisition of Osmos, we are taking the next step toward a future where autonomous AI agents work alongside people – helping reduce operational overhead and making it easier for customers to connect, prepare, analyze and share data across the organization,&quot; he said.

In a separate statement, Roy Hasson, Microsoft senior director of product, said the buy will simplify extract-transform-load data engineering tasks (ETL) with Apache Spark using AI.

&quot;Osmos launched their AI data wrangler and AI data engineering agents on Microsoft Fabric as a native app almost two years ago, allowing customers to quickly unpack, convert and transform complex, un/semi-structured data into ready-to-use Iceberg tables stored in [Microsoft lakehouse] OneLake,&quot; he said in a social media post.

&quot;We quickly realized that customers loved using Osmos on top of Fabric Spark and it reduced their dev and maintenance efforts by 50 percent.&quot;

The statement hints at a shift in emphasis in Microsoft&#39;s data platform strategy. The Fabric data platform launched in late 2023 by leaning heavily on open source technology from Databricks, which extensively works with Microsoft and integrates its products tightly into the Azure cloud.

Databricks was initially built around open source Spark, though it has since branched out. An example of the tight integration between the two firms comes from Microsoft&#39;s Mirroring data replication, which takes a snapshot of the external database to OneLake in Delta Parquet, an open source table format, originally developed by Databricks and a rival to Iceberg. Microsoft had initially put forward Delta as the table format of choice on Fabric, although it also supports Iceberg, which Databricks wants to integrate with Delta in the long term.

With the Osmos purchase, there is a shift in emphasis away from Delta and Databricks, which also provides automated ETL tools on Azure. Databricks must now compete with another Microsoft-owned product.

Osmos co-founder and CEO Kirat Pandya is a veteran of both Microsoft and Google. In 2021, Osmos raised $13 million in funding, led by Raviraj Jain from Lightspeed Venture Partners, with participation from CRV, Pear, and SV Angel. The value of the Microsoft buyout was not disclosed. ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Memory prices are set to spike again as chipmakers prioritize AI server production over consumer devices, with analysts warning of a high double-digit jump in Q1 2026 alone as demand outpaces supply.

Samsung Electronics and SK hynix are reportedly planning to raise server memory prices by up to 70 percent this quarter, according to Korea Economic Daily. Combined with 50 percent increases in 2025, this could nearly double prices by mid-2026.

The two Korean giants, alongside US-based Micron, dominate global memory production. All three are reallocating advanced manufacturing capacity to high-margin server DRAM and HBM chips for AI infrastructure, squeezing supply for PCs and smartphones.

Financial analysts have raised their earnings forecasts for the firms in response, as they look to benefit from the AI infrastructure boom that is driving up prices for everyone else.

Taiwan-based market watcher TrendForce reports that conventional DRAM prices already jumped 55-60 percent in a single quarter.

Yet despite the focus on server chips, supply of these components continues to be strained too, with supplier inventories falling and shipment growth reliant on wafer output increases, according to TrendForce. As a result, it forecasts that server DRAM prices will jump by more than 60 percent in the first quarter of 2026.

Prior to Christmas, analyst IDC noted the &quot;unprecedented&quot; memory chip shortage and warned this would have knock-on effects for both hardware makers and end users that may persist well into 2027.

&quot;The memory market is at an inflexion point, with demand materially outpacing supply,&quot; IDC stated, claiming that while the memory industry has long been characterized by boom-and-bust cycles, this one is different.

This crunch stems from AI&#39;s voracious appetite for memory - hyperscalers like Microsoft, Google, and Amazon are driving demand that&#39;s permanently reshaping silicon wafer allocation away from consumer products (phones and PCs). This restricts the supply of general-purpose memory modules and pushes up prices across the board.

IDC expects DRAM and NAND supply growth to lag at just 16 and 17 percent respectively this year, well below historical norms.

According to Reuters, shares in the big memory chip makers are rising in response, as investors rub their hands at the prospect of further price increases.

Shares in Micron surged 240 percent last year, while Samsung more than doubled and SK Hynix&#39;s market cap nearly quadrupled. Samsung&#39;s calendar Q4 operating profit is forecast to be up 160 percent, with SK hynix and Micron also expected to double profits in their next earnings disclosures.

Economists this week warned that AI infrastructure investment could fuel broader inflation as these price hikes ripple through the economy.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Russia-linked hackers are sneaking malware into European hotels and other hospitality outfits by tricking staff into installing it themselves through fake Windows Blue Screen of Death (BSOD) crashes.

In a report published this week, Securonix threat researchers said they have been tracking a stealthy infection campaign they&#39;re calling PHALT#BLYX, centered around a social engineering variant of the infamous ClickFix attack that begins with phishing emails mimicking Booking.com reservation cancellations.

The setup is straightforward: a hotel worker receives an email that appears to be from Booking.com, usually warning about an eye-watering charge in euros. When they follow the &quot;See details&quot; link, they&#39;re taken to what looks like a real Booking.com page – except instead of a reservation, they&#39;re met with a fake verification screen that quickly gives way to a full-screen Windows BSOD scare.

The bogus BSOD is designed to panic the user into &quot;fixing&quot; the non-existent error by performing a series of steps that ultimately have them paste and execute a malicious PowerShell command, the classic hallmark of a ClickFix attack. Because the victim manually runs the code themselves, it sidesteps many automated security controls that would block traditional drive-by malware download methods.

Once the command is executed, the system quietly downloads additional files and uses a legitimate Windows component to execute the attackers&#39; code, helping the malware blend in with regular activity and slip past security tools. The end result is the installation of a remote access trojan that gives the intruders ongoing control of the compromised machine, allowing them to spy on activity and deliver further malicious software, according to Securonix.

The security firm notes that the attackers have evolved their infection chain over several months, moving away from earlier, simpler HTML Application techniques to the more sophisticated MSBuild-based execution. That shift makes the malicious activity harder to detect with conventional antivirus tools.

The emphasis on euro-denominated charges and the targeting of hospitality organizations during a busy holiday season suggests a campaign squarely aimed at European companies, the researchers said. There are additional artifacts in the MSBuild project file that indicate Russian-language usage, and the DCRat family itself is widely traded on Russian underground forums, strengthening suspicions that miscreants linked to Russia may be responsible. ®

            <div id="article-text">﻿Sometimes AI doesn’t need to be a know-it-all, it just wants to keep you company.

﻿Sometimes AI doesn’t need to be a know-it-all, it just wants to keep you company.

Artificial intelligence doesn’t always want to optimize your life or steal your job. Sometimes, AI just wants to be your friend. And while robot pets weren’t the biggest stars of CES 2026, they’ve become more than just noise and are signaling how AI is apparently leaving our screens and taking on a physical presence in our lives.

To be clear, there’s no shortage of purpose-built machines on display in Las Vegas: there’s Samsung’s voice-controlled refrigerator, Bosch’s Alexa Plus-powered AI barista, and smarter robovacs like Narwal’s earring-finding Flow 2 or Anker’s Eufy S2, which moonlights as an aromatherapy diffuser – all promising to automate the drudgery of daily life. Humanoid robots like LG’s CLOiD and SwitchBot’s Onero H1 stole much of the spotlight, too, taking that logic a step further by promising more general-purpose helpers around the home — or the factory floor, in the case of Boston Dynamics’ Atlas — even if they remain years away from everyday use.

But not every robot at CES seems that interested in having a job. Away from the big demos and flashy promises of automation, a quieter trend is taking shape: machines designed for little purpose beyond existing. And they’re everywhere.

If you ever get bored charging your phone, Loona’s DeskMate offers a solution: it transforms your iPhone into a cutesy companion with oversized, Pixar-like eyes that track you as you talk. It has practical features too, like Slack integration and meeting assistance, but as a selling point they feel almost incidental to the companion experience. The company says the tool is powered by AI, though it does not say how.

Speaking of Pixar, AI robotics startup Zeroth wants to sell you a real-life WALL-E companion, or, in markets like the US where it lacks the Disney license, something close to WALL-E’s weird, off-brand cousin. The robot, called W1, doesn’t really do much besides follow you around, carrying small items, or snapping a few pictures. The company says W1 is built on “advanced mobility and environmental AI,” though details are vague.

Zeroth is also bringing a doll-sized humanoid robot, M1, to the US, an at-home companion that blends utility — reminders, childcare assistance, fall detection — with companionship, making use of Google’s Gemini AI model for conversations. That combination has already secured an audience for social robots popular in parts of Asia, particularly in China and South Korea, where the robots are popular with children and the elderly. CES 2026 suggests this concept is now being deliberately repackaged and marketed for Western homes.

Others leaned even more explicitly into emotional companionship. In other words: robot pets. There’s Fuzozo, a puffball that purrs when you pet it and can recognize its owner. Unlike many housebound AI devices, it has a cellular connection, allowing it to be carried around with you, a hint at how ubiquitous these products might be in the future, even if it’s unclear how precisely AI is being used.

Robovac company Ecovacs was also marketing a robot that resembles a Bichon Frisé. It says the emotional companion robot, LilMilo, uses AI and “lifelike biometrics” to recognize voices, develop a personality, and adapt to user habits. As with other products, details on the AI element inside LilMilo are generic and nondescript. It’s an odd product for a company that just launched a robotic pool cleaner, and a telling sign of how companies increasingly expect us to welcome physical AI companions into our homes not for what they do, but simply for being there.

A robotic arm lifts the Spino S1 Pro into a docking station on the side of your pool.

Mammotion, the company best known for its line of robot lawnmowers, is launching a robot pool cleaner that can take itself out of the water.

As shown during CES 2026, the Spino S1 Pro comes with a robotic arm mounted to a docking station that sits at the edge of your pool. When the bot is ready to charge, the Spino S1 Pro uses an underwater communication system to guide itself to the docking station, which lifts the device up and out of the water. To clean, it uses an onboard camera and several sensors to navigate your pool while identifying messy areas, steps, edges, corners, and obstacles.

The Spino S1 Pro comes with five brushless motors and treads that grip the bottom and sides of your pool, pumping up to 6,800 gallons per hour through its dual-layer filter to capture silt, sand, and other debris. Mammotion says the device can maintain connectivity within a 10-meter radius of its dock, but the company doesn’t mention how long its battery will last, and whether it’ll be longer than the up to 210 minutes (3.5 hours) offered by the Spino E1.

The Spino S1 Pro will launch in the first quarter of this year, “with final specs and pricing to be revealed,” according to Mammotion.

There was a time not too long ago when buying a power bank was as easy as choosing the cheapest portable battery that could charge your phone and quickly slip into your pocket, purse, or backpack. The hardest part was deciding whether it was time to ditch USB-A ports.

Recently, however, brands have been slathering on features, many of which are superfluous, in an attempt to both stand out from the commodified pack and justify higher price points. It’s especially prevalent amongst the bigger power banks that can also charge laptops, those that butt right up to the “airline friendly” 99Wh (around 27,650mAh) size limit.

At CES 2026, we’re seeing a trend towards power banks with integrated cables, which is very convenient. But a similar trend to slap large, energy-sapping displays onto these portable batteries is silly. And that’s just the start of the atrocities witnessed in recent months.

The power bank that pushed things over the edge for me is the $270 EcoFlow Rapid Pro X Power Bank 27k that I received for review. Here’s my review: it’s bad. Do. Not. Buy. As a power bank, it tries too hard to do too much, making it too expensive, too big, too slow, and too heavy.

The snap-on decorative faceplates are ridiculous and the proprietary magnetic modules for its Apple Watch charger and retractable USB-C cable are too easy to misplace.

The giant display EcoFlow uses scratches easily and is too dim to easily read outdoors. The confusing UX on the Rapid Pro X model is especially offensive in its touch-sensitive clumsiness. Nobody needs a display that takes 30 seconds to wake up from sleep and plays swirly graphics and blinking eyeballs when awake, slowly sapping the power bank’s energy reserves. The fact that it has a screensaver tells me that the product team completely lost the plot.

Anker’s also guilty of putting large displays onto its power banks. Most people don’t need anything more than four dots to show the remaining capacity, but it’s becoming increasingly difficult to buy a power bank without an LCD display. In the 20,000mAh range, Anker doesn’t even list a display-less model anymore. I, like many Verge readers, love to see the actually wattage pumping in and out of those ports — but the vast majority of people have no need for that.

Anker, like EcoFlow, also offers power banks with proprietary pogo-pin connectors, Both companies use those connectors to lure owners into buying expensive desk chargers that don’t work with anything else. Those extra-fast charging speeds are unlikely to justify the premium expense.

Most people, even tech savvy Verge readers, don’t need a power bank that can output 140W over USB-C. The majority of non-gaming laptops require 65W or less. And the primary computing device for most people — the phone — only requires about 20W.

We certainly don’t need power banks with built-in hotspots when that’s already built into our Android and iOS phones. Baseus made one anyway.

Bluetooth and Wi-Fi connectivity are becoming a common feature in some flagship power banks. I’m all for remotely monitoring massive power stations used to power off-grid homes and campers, but not a portable power bank that’s charging the phone in your hand or is plugged into a nearby wall jack.

We also don’t need integrated flashlights. Why random Amazon brand, why?

All these extra “features” just add weight, size, and cost to power banks. They also increase the risk that something will go wrong on a device that’s meant to always be with you and just work when you need it. And power banks don’t need any extra help justifying a recall.

One power bank trend I can get behind is integrated cables like the retractable version found on EcoFlow’s Rapid Pro Power Bank 27k (note the lack of “X” in the name). Always having a properly specced cable that matches the device’s max input and output is super convenient. I like that Kuxiu’s S3 MagSafe power bank, for example, neatly wraps the cable around the chassis to plug into a hidden USB-C jack. That way the cable can be replaced if it frays or breaks.

I’m also a fan of adding kickstands to MagSafe power banks that prop phones up at your preferred angle for extended viewing or recording. More importantly, a few companies are now adopting semi-solid state chemistry that makes their power banks less susceptible to thermal runaway, which was an industry plague in 2025. They cost more to buy, but they’re cheaper to own over their extended lifetimes.

I can’t help but enjoy the look of Sharge’s Retractable 3-in-1 Power Bank, even though its integrated wall outlet and underwhelming specs for a battery pack of this size and price completely undercuts my entire argument. I’m a sucker for Braun design, forgive me!

There are still basic power banks available that charge phones and even laptops without too much feature creep and attempted upsell. If all you want is to charge your phone then there’s Anker’s trusty $26 PowerCore 10k or, if you’re feeling fancy, Nitecore’s $65 NB10000 Gen 3 Ultra-Slim USB-C Power Bank. If you also want to charge laptops then you might consider INIU’s delightfully named Cougar P64-E1 Power Bank Fastest 140W 25000mAh for $90, or even Belkin’s more capable $150 UltraCharge Pro Laptop Power Bank 27K coming in March.

The fastest and most powerful power banks with lots of gee-whiz features will often generate headlines for pushing the envelope of what’s possible. But the “best” power bank might not be best for you, when basic affordability is all you really need.

Asus is introducing an ultra-light Zenbook A16 to accompany its refreshed A14 model.

If you buy something from a Verge link, Vox Media may earn a commission. See our ethics statement.

Asus’ Zenbook A14 that debuted at last year’s CES is now getting a bigger sibling for CES 2026. The new Asus Zenbook A16 is a 16-inch counterpart to refreshed Zenbook A14, both packing Qualcomm Snapdragon X2 Elite processors. The two Zenbook A models are very similar, both sporting OLED displays, two USB 4 ports, one USB-A, 70Whr batteries, and Asus’ Ceraluminum coating in earthy beige and gray tones.

The new 16-inch model separates itself with its bigger and better display and a built-in SD card slot. The screen of the A16 is 2880 x 1800 / 120Hz to the A14’s 1920 x 1200 / 60Hz, and it can hit 1,100 nits of peak brightness to the smaller model’s 600 nits.

Both the Zenbook A14 and A16 are incredibly light. In some configurations the A14 weighs under 2.2 pounds / 1kg, and the A16 is just shy of 2.65 pounds / 1.2kg. The 16-inch is around the weight of the LG Gram 16, which is a laptop that’s all about lightness, but the LG doesn’t have an SD card slot. I called the Zenbook A14 Asus’ wannabe MacBook Air when it launched last year, and the A16 seems to want to be the 15-inch MacBook Air alternative. Though, if you’re a photographer like me, that SD card slot seems a nice quality-of-life upgrade.

The new Zenbook A14 and A16 are set to launch in early-to-mid Q2 2026, with pricing to be determined later.

The two displays get much closer now for a tidier setup. Plus, it’s got a big-ass battery.

The Asus Zenbook Duo is getting a chip upgrade, an overhauled hinge design, and a big battery upgrade for CES 2026. The new dual-screen laptop will get Intel Panther Lake when it launches later in Q1 2026, though its pricing isn’t finalized. But the most noticeable change is to its finish and its hinge. The Duo now uses Asus’ Ceraluminum finish for a textured feel, and its hinge creates a much more seamless dual-screen experience with less of a gap between the two 14-inch 2880 x 1800 / 144Hz OLED displays.

The new Zenbook Duo also has a slightly smaller footprint compared to the last-gen version, but with a much larger 99Wh battery over the previous gen’s 75Wh. The pogo pins for attaching its keyboard and trackpad deck over the lower display are now magnetic, so they hide away into the chassis as you yank off the keyboard and slowly emerge as you attach it.

The new Duo may seem not all too different from the last-gen version when viewed in a vacuum, but sitting side by side with the last-gen model shows the hinge difference to be night and day. I’ll be looking forward to testing this one in addition to its new gaming counterpart, the 2026 Zephyrus Duo.

The convertible has GoPro-like ribbed lines on its chassis, and it’s joined by a new PZ14 detachable tablet.

Asus is announcing a new ProArt PX13 convertible laptop and ProArt PZ14 detachable tablet for CES 2026. The PX13 comes in two versions: a standard model and a GoPro Edition. Both feature a stylus-compatible 13.3-inch 2880 x 1800 OLED display, dial pad control built into the trackpad, and AMD’s “Strix Halo” Ryzen AI Max APU options.

But what’s special about the GoPro Edition is the inspiration it takes from the popular action cameras: It has vertical lines on its lid, blue color accents, and a hard-shell laptop sleeve you can strap gear to, and the included packaging features pluck-and-pull foam for protecting your gear. The PX13 GoPro Edition also includes one year of GoPro Cloud Plus subscription.

The new ProArt PZ14 is like a toned-down ROG Flow tablet aimed at creators instead of gamers, bundled with a Bluetooth-compatible keyboard / trackpad cover and Asus Pen 3.0 stylus (with a wireless charging pen holder built in). As its name denotes, the PZ14 is larger than the last-gen PZ13, with a 14-inch 2880 x 1800 / 144Hz OLED display capable of 1,000 nits peak brightness in HDR. Despite its larger screen, the tablet is still 9mm thick and weighs a little less at 1.74 pounds / 0.79kg — while packing in a slightly larger 75Wh battery. It features a Qualcomm Snapdragon X2 Elite processor with decent port selection: two USB4 and a full-size SD card slot.

The ProArt PX13 and PX13 GoPro Edition are due out in late Q1 or early Q2 2026. The ProArt PZ14 launches in mid-to-late Q2. Asus doesn’t have finalized pricing on its new laptops at this time.

Four bright spots in climate news in 2025

Climate news wasn’t great in 2025. Global greenhouse-gas emissions hit record highs (again). It’s set to be either the second or third warmest on record. Climate-fueled disasters like wildfires in California and flooding in Indonesia and Pakistan devastated communities and caused billions in damage.

There’s no doubt that we’re in a severe situation. But for those looking for bright spots, there was some good news in 2025, too. Here are just a few of the positive stories our climate reporters noticed this year. Read the full story.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Last spring, 3,000 British soldiers of the 4th Light Brigade, also known as the Black Rats, descended upon the damp forests of Estonia’s eastern territories. They had rushed in from Yorkshire by air, sea, rail, and road. Once there, the Rats joined 14,000 other troops at the front line, dug in, and waited for the distant rumble of enemy armor.

The deployment was part of a NATO exercise called Hedgehog, intended to test the alliance’s capacity to react to a large Russian incursion. Naturally, it featured some of NATO’s heaviest weaponry: 69-ton battle tanks, Apache attack helicopters, and truck-mounted rocket launchers capable of firing supersonic missiles.

But according to British Army tacticians, it was the 4th Brigade that brought the biggest knife to the fight—and strictly speaking, it wasn’t even a physical weapon. The Rats were backed up by an invisible automated intelligence network, known as a “digital targeting web,” conceived under the name Project ASGARD.

The system had been cobbled together over the course of four months—an astonishing pace for weapons development, which is usually measured in years. Its purpose is to connect everything that looks for targets—“sensors,” in military lingo—and everything that fires on them (“shooters”) to a single, shared wireless electronic brain.

Say a reconnaissance drone spots a tank hiding in a copse. In conventional operations, the soldier operating that drone would pass the intelligence through a centralized command chain of officers, the brains of the mission, who would collectively decide whether to shoot at it.

But a targeting web operates more like an octopus, whose neurons reach every extremity, allowing each of its tentacles to operate autonomously while also working collaboratively toward a central set of goals.

During Hedgehog, the drones over Estonia traced wide orbits. They scanned the ground below with advanced object recognition systems. If one of them spied that hidden tank, it would transmit its image and location directly to nearby shooters—an artillery cannon, for example. Or another tank. Or an armed loitering munition drone sitting on a catapult, ready for launch.

The soldiers responsible for each weapon interfaced with the targeting web by means of Samsung smartphones. Once alerted to the detected target, the drone crew merely had to thumb a dropdown menu on the screen—which lists the available targeting options based on factors such as their pKill, which stands for “probability of kill”—for the drone to whip off into the sky and trace an all but irreversible course to its unsuspecting mark.

Eighty years after total war last transformed the continent, the Hedgehog tests signal a brutal new calculus of European defense. “The Russians are knocking on the door,” says Sven Weizenegger, the head of the German military’s Cyber Innovation Hub. Strategists and policymakers are counting on increasingly automated battlefield gadgetry to keep them from bursting through.

“AI-enabled intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance and mass-­deployed drones have become decisive on the battlefield,” says Angelica Tikk, head of the Innovation Department at the Estonian Ministry of Defense. For a small state like Estonia, Tikk says, such technologies “allow us to punch above our weight.”

“Mass-deployed,” in this case, is very much the operative term. Ukraine scaled up its drone production for its war against Russia from 2.2 million in 2024 to 4.5 million in 2025. EU defense and space commissioner Andrius Kubilius has estimated that in the event of a wider war with Russia the EU will need three million drones annually just to hold down Lithuania, a country of some 2.9 million people that’s about the size of West Virginia.

Projects like ASGARD would take these figures and multiply them with the other key variable of warfare: speed. British officials claim that the targeting web’s kill chain, from the first detection of a target to strike decision, could take less than a minute. As a result, a press release noted, the system “will make the army 10 times more lethal over the next 10 years.” It is slated to be completed by 2027. Germany’s armed forces plan to deploy their own targeting web, Uranos KI, as early as 2026.

The working theory behind these initiatives is that the right mix of lethal drones—conceived by a new crop of tech firms, sprinted to the front lines with uncommon haste, and guided to their targets by algorithmic networks—will deliver Europe an overwhelming victory in the event of an outright war. Or better yet, it will give the continent such a wide advantage that nobody would think to attack it in the first place, an effect that Eric Slesinger, a Madrid-based venture capitalist focused on defense startups, describes as “brutal, guns-and-steel, feel-it-in-your-gut deterrence.”

But leaning too much on this new mathematics of warfare could be a risky bet. The costs of actually winning a massive drone war are likely to be more than just financial. The human toll of these technologies would extend far behind the front lines, fundamentally transforming how the European Union—from its outset, a project of peace—lives, fights, and dies. And even then, victory would be far from assured.

If anything, Europe could be laying its hand on a perpetual hair trigger that nobody can afford for it to pull.

Twenty companies participated in Project ASGARD. They range from eager startups, flush with VC backing, to defense giants like General Dynamics. Each contender could play an important role in Europe’s future. But no firm among them has more tightly captured the current European military zeitgeist than Helsing, which provided both drones and AI for the project.

Founded in 2021 by a theoretical physicist, a former McKinsey partner, and a biologist turned video-game developer, with an early investment of €100 million (then about $115 million) from Spotify CEO Daniel Ek, Helsing has quickly risen to the apex of Europe’s new defense tech ecosystem.

The Munich-based company has an established presence in Europe’s major capitals, staffed by a deep bench of former government and military officials. Buoyed by a series of high-profile government contracts and partnerships, along with additional rounds of funding, the company catapulted to a $12 billion valuation last June. It is now Europe’s most valuable defense startup by a wide margin, and the one that would be most likely to find itself at the tip of the spear if Europe’s new cold war were to suddenly turn hot.

Originally, the company made military software. But it has recently expanded its offerings to include physical weapons such as AI-assisted missile drones and uncrewed autonomous fighter jets.

In part, this reflects a shift in European demand. In March 2025, the European Commission called for a “once-in-a-generation surge in European defence investment,” citing drones and AI as two of seven priority investment areas for a new initiative that will unlock almost a trillion dollars for weapons over the coming years. Germany alone has allocated nearly $12 billion to build its drone arsenal.

“You raise money, you create technology using this money that you raised, and then you go to market with that.”

But in equal measure, the company is looking to shape Europe’s military-industrial posture. In conventional weapons programs in Europe, governments tell companies what to build through a rigid contracting process. Helsing flips that process on its head. Like a growing number of new defense firms, it is guided by what Antoine Bordes, its chief scientist, describes as “a more traditional tech-startup muscle.”

“You raise money, you create technology using this money that you raised, and then you go to market with that,” says Bordes, who was previously a leader in AI research at Meta. Government officials across Europe have proved receptive to the model, calling for agile contracting instruments that allow militaries to more easily open their pocketbooks when a company comes to them with an idea.

Helsing’s pitch deck for the future of European defense bristles with weapons that will operate across land, air, sea, and space. In the highest reaches of Helsing’s imagined battlefield, a constellation of reconnaissance satellites, which the company is collaborating on with Loft Orbital, will “detect, identify and classify military assets worldwide.”

Lower down, the company’s HF-1 and HX-2 loitering munition drones—so called because they combine the functions of a small reconnaissance drone and a missile—can stalk the skies for long periods before zeroing in on their targets. To date, the company has publicly disclosed orders for around 10,000 airframes to be delivered to Ukraine. It won’t say how many have been deployed, although it told Bloomberg in April that its drones had been used in dozens of successful missions in the conflict.

At sea, the company envisions battalions of drone mini-subs that can plunge as deep as 3,000 feet and rove for 90 days without human control, serving as a hidden guard watch for maritime incursions.

Helsing’s newest offering, the Europa, is a four-and-a-half-ton fighter jet with no human pilot on board. In a set of moody promo pictures released in 2025, the drone has the profile of an upturned boning knife. Carrying hundreds of pounds of weaponry, it is meant to charge deep into heavily defended airspace, flying under the command of a human pilot much farther away (like Tom Cruise in Top Gun: Maverick if his costars were robots and he were safely beyond the range of enemy anti-aircraft missiles). Helsing says that the Europa, which resembles designs offered by a number of other firms, is engineered to be “mass-producible.”

Linking all these elements together is Altra, the company’s so-called “­recce-strike software platform,” which served as part of the collective brain in the ASGARD trials. It’s the key piece. “These kill webs are competitive in attack and defense,” says General Richard Barrons, a former commander of the United Kingdom’s Joint Forces Command, who recently coauthored a major Ministry of Defense modernization plan that champions the deterrent effect of autonomous targeting webs. Barrons invited me to imagine Russian leaders contemplating a possible incursion into Narva in eastern Estonia. “If they’ve done a reasonable job,” he said, referring to NATO, “Russia knows not to do that … that little incursion—it will never get there. It’ll be destroyed the minute it sets foot across the border.”

With a targeting web in place, a medley of missiles, drones, and artillery could coordinate across borders and domains to hit anything that moves. On its product page for Altra, Helsing notes that the system is capable of orchestrating “saturation attacks,” a military tactic for breaching an adversary’s defenses with a barrage of synchronized weapon strikes. The goal of the technology, a Helsing VP named Simon Brünjes explained in a speech to an Israeli defense convention in 2024, is “lethality that deters effectively.”

To put it a bit less delicately, the idea is to show any potential aggressors that Europe is capable, if provoked, of absolutely losing its shit. The US Navy is working to establish a similar capacity for defending Taiwan with hordes of autonomous drones that rain down on Chinese vessels in coordinated volleys. The admirals have their own name for the result such swarms are intended to achieve: “hellscape.”

The biggest obstacle to achieving the full effect of saturation attacks is not the technology. It’s the human element. “A million drones are great, but you’re going to need a million people,” says Richard Drake, head of the European branch of Anduril, which builds a product range similar to Helsing’s and also participated in ASGARD.

Drake says the kill chain in a system like ASGARD “can all be done autonomously.” But for now, “there is a human in the loop making those final decisions.” Government rules require it. Echoing the stance of most other European states, Estonia’s Tikk told me, “We also insist that human control is maintained over decisions related to the use of lethal force.”

Helsing’s drones in Ukraine use object recognition to detect targets, which the operator reviews before approving a strike. The aircraft operate without human control only once they enter their “terminal guidance” phase, about half a mile from their target. Some locally produced drones employ similar “last mile” autonomy. This hands-free strike mode is said to have a hit rate in the range of 75%, according to research by the Center for Strategic and International Studies. (A Helsing spokesperson said that the company uses “multiple visual aids” to mitigate “potential difficulties” in target recognition during terminal guidance.)

That doesn’t quite make them killer robots. But it suggests that the barriers to full lethal autonomy are no longer necessarily technical. Helsing’s Brünjes has reportedly said its strike drones can “technically” perform missions without human control, though the company does not support full autonomy. Bordes declined to say whether the company’s fielded drones can be switched into a fully autonomous mode in the event that a government changes its policy midway through a conflict.

Either way, the company could loosen the loop in the coming years. Helsing’s AI team in Paris, led by Bordes, is working to enable a single human to oversee multiple HX-2 drones in flight simultaneously. Anduril is developing a similar “one-to-many” system in which a single operator could marshal a fleet of 10 or more drones at a time, Drake says.

In such swarms a human is technically still involved, but that person’s capacity to decide upon the actions of any single drone is diminished, especially if the drones are coordinating to saturate a wide area. (In a statement, a Helsing spokesperson told MIT Technology Review, “We do not and will not build technology where a machine makes the final decision.”)

“The international community is crossing a threshold which may be difficult, if not impossible, to reverse later.”

Like other projects in its portfolio, Helsing’s research on swarming HX-2s is not intended for a current government contract but, rather, to anticipate future ones. “We feel that this needs to be done, and done properly, because this is what we need,” Bordes told me.

To be sure, this thinking is not happening in a vacuum. The push toward autonomy in Ukraine is largely driven by advances in jamming technologies, which disrupt the links between drones and their operators. Russia has reportedly been upgrading its strike drones with sharper autonomous target recognition, as well as modems that enable them to communicate among themselves in a sort of proto-swarm. In October, it conducted a test of an autonomous torpedo said to be capable of carrying nuclear warheads powerful enough to create tsunamis.

Governments are well aware that if Europe’s only response to such challenges is to further automate its own lethality, the result could be a race with no winners. “The international community is crossing a threshold which may be difficult, if not impossible, to reverse later,” UN Special Rapporteur Morris Tidball-Binz has warned.

And yet officials are struggling to imagine an alternative. “If you don’t have the people, then you can’t control so many drones,” says Weizenegger, of the German Cyber Innovation Hub. “So therefore you need swarming technologies in place—you know, autonomous systems.”

“It sounds very harsh,” he says, referring to the idea of removing the human from the loop. “But it’s about winning or losing. There are only these two options. There is no third option.”

In its pitches, Helsing often emphasizes a sense of dire urgency. “We don’t know when we could be attacked,” one executive said at a technology summit in Berlin in September 2025. “Are we ready to fight tonight in the Baltics? The answer is no.”

The company boasts that it has a singular capacity to fix that. In September 2024 it embarked on a project to develop an AI agent capable of controlling fighter aircraft. By May of the following year the agent was operating a Swedish Gripen E jet in tests over the Baltic Sea. The company calls such timelines “Helsing speed.” The Europa combat jet drone is slated to be ready by 2029.

European governments have adopted a similar fixation with haste. “We need to fast-track,” says Weizenegger. “If we start testing in 2029, it’s probably too late.” Last February, announcing that Denmark would increase defense spending by 50 billion kroner ($7 billion), Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen told a press conference, “If we can’t get the best equipment, buy the next best. There’s only one thing that counts now, and that is speed.”

That same month, Helsing announced that it will establish a network of “resilience factories” across Europe—dispersed and secret—to churn out drones at a wartime clip. The network will be put to its first real test in the coming months, when the German government finalizes a planned €300 million order for 12,000 Helsing HX-2s to equip an armored brigade stationed in Lithuania.

The company says that its first factory, somewhere in southern Germany, can produce 1,000 drones a month—or roughly six drones an hour, assuming a respectable 40-hour European work week. At that pace, it would fill Germany’s order in a year. In reality, though, it could take longer. As of last summer, the facility was operating at less than half its capacity because of staffing shortages. (A company spokesperson did not respond to questions about its current production capacity and declined to provide information on how many drones it has produced to date.)

It will take a lot of factories for Europe to fully arm up. When Helsing unveiled its resilience factory project, one of its founders, Torsten Reil, wrote on LinkedIn that “100,000 HX-2 strike drones would deter a land invasion of Europe once and for all.” Helsing now says that Germany alone should maintain a store of 200,000 HX-2s to tide it over for the first two months of a Russian invasion.

Even if Europe can surge its capacity to such levels, not everyone is convinced that massed drones are a winning pitch. While drones now account for somewhere between 70% and 80% of all combat casualties in Ukraine, “they’re not determining outcomes on the battlefield,” says Stacie Pettyjohn, director of the defense program at the Center for a New American Security. Rather, drones have brought the conflict to a grinding stalemate, leading to what a team of American, British, and French air force officers have called “a Somme in the sky.”

This dynamic has led to remarkable advances in drone communications and autonomy. But each breakthrough is quickly met with a countermeasure. In some areas where jamming has made wireless communication particularly difficult, pilots control their drones using long spools of fiber-­optic filament. In turn, their opponents have engineered rotating barbed wire traps to snare the filaments as they drag along the ground, as well as drone interceptors that can knock the unjammable drones out of the sky.

“If you produce millions of drones right now, they will become obsolete in maybe a year or half a year,” says Kateryna Bondar, a former Ukrainian government advisor. “So it doesn’t make sense to produce them, stockpile, and wait for attack.”

Nor is AI necessarily up to the task of piloting so many drones, despite industry claims to the contrary. Bohdan Sas, a founder of the Ukrainian drone company Buntar Aerospace, told me that he finds it amusing when Western companies claim to have achieved “super-fancy recognition and target acquisition on some target in testing,” only to reveal that the test site was “an open field and a target in the center.”

“It’s not really how it works in reality,” Sas says. “In reality, everything is really well hidden.” (A Helsing spokesperson said, “Our target recognition technology has proven itself on the battlefield hundreds of times.”)

Zachary Kallenborn, a research associate at the University of Oxford, told me that in Ukraine, Russian forces have been known to deactivate the autonomous functionalities of their Lancet loitering munitions. In real-world conditions, he says, AI can fail—“And so what happens if you have 100,000 drones operating that way?”

In September, while reporting this story, I visited Corbera, a town perched on a rocky outcrop among the limestone hills of Terra Alta in western Catalonia. In the late summer of 1938, Corbera was the site of some of the most intense fighting of the Spanish Civil War.

The site is just as much a reminder of past horrors as it is a warning of future ones. The town was repeatedly targeted by German and Italian aircraft, a breakthrough technology that was, at the time, roughly as novel as modern drones are to us today. Military planners who led the Spanish campaigns famously used the raids to perfect the technology’s destructive potential.

For the last four years, Ukraine has served a similar role as Europe’s living laboratory of carnage. According to Bondar, some Ukrainian units have begun charging Western companies a fee to operate their drones in battle. In return, the companies receive reams of real-world data that can’t be replicated on a test range.

“We need to keep reminding ourselves that the business of war, as an aspect of the human condition, is as brutal and undesirable and feral as it always is.”

What this data doesn’t show is the mess that the technology leaves behind. In Ukraine, drones now account for more civilian casualties than any other weapon. A United Nations human rights commission recently concluded that Russia has used drones “with the primary purpose to spread terror among the civilian population”—a crime against humanity—along a 185-mile stretch of the Dnipro River. One local resident told investigators, “We are hit every day. Drones fly at any time—morning, evening, day or night, constantly.” The commission also sought to investigate Russian allegations of Ukrainian drone attacks on civilians but was not granted sufficient access to make a determination.

A European drone war would invite similar tragedies on a much grander scale. Tens of millions of people live within drone-strike range of Europe’s eastern border with Russia. Today’s ethical calculus could change. At a media event last summer, Helsing’s Brünjes told reporters that in Ukraine, “we want a human to be making the decision” in lethal strikes. But in “a full-scale war with China or Russia,” he said, “it’s a different question.”

In the scenario of an incursion into Narva, Richard Barrons told me that Russia should also know that once its initial attack is repelled, NATO would use long-range missiles and jet drones—abetted by the same targeting webs—to immediately retaliate deep within Russian territory. Such talk may be bluster. The point of deterrence is, after all, to stave off war with the mere threat of unbearable violence. But it can leave little room for deescalation in the event of an actual fight. Could one be sure that Russia, which recently lowered its threshold for using nuclear weapons, would stand down? “The mindset that these kinds of systems are now being rolled out in is one where we’re not imagining off-ramps,” says Richard Moyes, the director of ​Article 36, a British nonprofit focused on the protection of civilians in conflict.

To this day, Corbera’s old center lies in ruins. The crumbled homes sit desolate of life but for the fig trees struggling up through the rubble and the odd skink that scurries across a splintered beam. Walking through the wasteland, I was taken by how much it resembles any other war zone. It could have been Tigray, or Khartoum. Or Gaza, a living hellscape where AI targeting tools played a central role in accelerating Israel’s cataclysmic bombing campaign. What particular innovation wrought such misery seemed almost beside the point.

“We need to keep reminding ourselves that the business of war, as an aspect of the human condition, is as brutal and undesirable and feral as it always is,” Barrons told me, a couple of weeks after I was in Corbera. “I think on planet Helsing and Anduril,” he went on, “they’re not really fighting, in many respects. And it’s a different mindset.”

A Helsing spokesperson told MIT Technology Review that the company “was founded to provide democracies with technology built in Europe essential for credible deterrence, and to ensure this technology is developed in line with tight ethical standards.” He went on to say that “ethically built autonomous systems are limiting noncombatant casualties more effectively than any previous category of weapon.”

Would such a claim, if true, bear out in a gloves-off war between major powers? “I would be extraordinarily cautious of anyone who says, ‘Yeah, 100% this is how the future of autonomous warfare looks,’” Kallenborn told me. And yet, there are some certainties we can count on. Every weapon, no matter how smart, carries within it a variation of the same story. “Lethality” means what it says. The only difference is how quickly—and how massively—that story comes to its sad, definitive end.

Sometimes AI feels like a niche topic to write about, but then the holidays happen, and I hear relatives of all ages talking about cases of chatbot-induced psychosis, blaming rising electricity prices on data centers, and asking whether kids should have unfettered access to AI. It’s everywhere, in other words. And people are alarmed.

Inevitably, these conversations take a turn: AI is having all these ripple effects now, but if the technology gets better, what happens next? That’s usually when they look at me, expecting a forecast of either doom or hope.

I probably disappoint, if only because predictions for AI are getting harder and harder to make.

Despite that, MIT Technology Review has, I must say, a pretty excellent track record of making sense of where AI is headed. We’ve just published a sharp list of predictions for what’s next in 2026 (where you can read my thoughts on the legal battles surrounding AI), and the predictions on last year’s list all came to fruition. But every holiday season, it gets harder and harder to work out the impact AI will have. That’s mostly because of three big unanswered questions.

For one, we don’t know if large language models will continue getting incrementally smarter in the near future. Since this particular technology is what underpins nearly all the excitement and anxiety in AI right now, powering everything from AI companions to customer service agents, its slowdown would be a pretty huge deal. Such a big deal, in fact, that we devoted a whole slate of stories in December to what a new post-AI-hype era might look like.

Number two, AI is pretty abysmally unpopular among the general public. Here’s just one example: Nearly a year ago, OpenAI’s Sam Altman stood next to President Trump to excitedly announce a $500 billion project to build data centers across the US in order to train larger and larger AI models. The pair either did not guess or did not care that many Americans would staunchly oppose having such data centers built in their communities. A year later, Big Tech is waging an uphill battle to win over public opinion and keep on building. Can it win?

The response from lawmakers to all this frustration is terribly confused. Trump has pleased Big Tech CEOs by moving to make AI regulation a federal rather than a state issue, and tech companies are now hoping to codify this into law. But the crowd that wants to protect kids from chatbots ranges from progressive lawmakers in California to the increasingly Trump-aligned Federal Trade Commission, each with distinct motives and approaches. Will they be able to put aside their differences and rein AI firms in?

If the gloomy holiday dinner table conversation gets this far, someone will say: Hey, isn’t AI being used for objectively good things? Making people healthier, unearthing scientific discoveries, better understanding climate change?

Well, sort of. Machine learning, an older form of AI, has long been used in all sorts of scientific research. One branch, called deep learning, forms part of AlphaFold, a Nobel Prize–winning tool for protein prediction that has transformed biology. Image recognition models are getting better at identifying cancerous cells.

But the track record for chatbots built atop newer large language models is more modest. Technologies like ChatGPT are quite good at analyzing large swathes of research to summarize what’s already been discovered. But some high-profile reports that these sorts of AI models had made a genuine discovery, like solving a previously unsolved mathematics problem, were bogus. They can assist doctors with diagnoses, but they can also encourage people to diagnose their own health problems without consulting doctors, sometimes with disastrous results.

This time next year, we’ll probably have better answers to my family’s questions, and we’ll have a bunch of entirely new questions too. In the meantime, be sure to read our full piece forecasting what will happen this year, featuring predictions from the whole AI team.

They managed to cut the size of the AI reasoning model by more than half—and claim it can now answer politically sensitive questions once off limits in Chinese AI systems.

A conversation with a chatbot can shift people&#39;s political views—but the most persuasive models also spread the most misinformation.

            <h2>The overlooked driver of digital transformation</h2>
            <p><strong>MIT Technology Review | 2026-01-05</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2026/01/05/1124662/the-overlooked-driver-of-digital-transformation/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">When business leaders talk about digital transformation, their focus often jumps straight to cloud platforms, AI tools, or collaboration software. Yet, one of the most fundamental enablers of how organizations now work, and how employees experience that work, is often overlooked: audio.

As Genevieve Juillard, CEO of IDC, notes, the shift to hybrid collaboration made every space, from corporate boardrooms to kitchen tables, meeting-ready almost overnight. In the scramble, audio quality often lagged, creating what research now shows is more than a nuisance. Poor sound can alter how speakers are perceived, making them seem less credible or even less trustworthy.

&quot;Audio is the gatekeeper of meaning,” stresses Julliard. “If people can&#39;t hear clearly, they can&#39;t understand you. And if they can&#39;t understand you, they can&#39;t trust you, and they can&#39;t act on what you said. And no amount of sharp video can fix that.&quot; Without clarity, comprehension and confidence collapse.

For Shure, which has spent a century advancing sound technology, the implications extend far beyond convenience. Chris Schyvinck, Shure’s president and CEO, explains that ineffective audio undermines engagement and productivity. Meetings stall, decisions slow, and fatigue builds.

&quot;Use technology to make hybrid meetings seamless, and then be clear on which conversations truly require being in the same physical space,&quot; says Juillard. &quot;If you can strike that balance, you&#39;re not just making work more efficient, you&#39;re making it more sustainable, you&#39;re also making it more inclusive, and you&#39;re making it more resilient.&quot;

When audio is prioritized on equal footing with video and other collaboration tools, organizations can gain something rare: frictionless communication. That clarity ensures the machines listening in, from AI transcription engines to real-time translation systems, can deliver reliable results.

The research from Shure and IDC highlights two blind spots for leaders. First, buying decisions too often privilege price over quality, with costly consequences in productivity and trust. Second, organizations underestimate the stress poor sound imposes on employees, intensifying the cognitive load of already demanding workdays. Addressing both requires leaders to view audio not as a peripheral expense but as core infrastructure.

Looking ahead, audio is becoming inseparable from AI-driven collaboration. Smarter systems can already filter out background noise, enhance voices in real time, and integrate seamlessly into hybrid ecosystems.

&quot;We should be able to provide improved accessibility and a more equitable meeting experience for people,&quot; says Schyvinck.

For Schyvinck and Juillard, the future belongs to companies that treat audio transformation as an integral part of digital transformation, building workplaces that are more sustainable, equitable, and resilient.

Clear audio is imperative not only for quality communication, but also for brand equity, both for internal and external stakeholders and even the company as a whole.Two words for you: audio transformation.My guests today are Chris Schyvinck, President and CEO at Shure. And Genevieve Juillard, CEO at IDC.Welcome Chris and Genevieve.

Chris Schyvinck: It&#39;s really nice to be here. Thank you very much.

Genevieve Juillard: Yeah, thank you so much for having us. Great to be here.

Megan Tatum: Thank you both so much for being here. Genevieve, we could start with you. Let&#39;s start with some history perhaps for context. How would you describe the evolution of audio technology and how use cases and our expectations of audio have evolved? What have been some of the major drivers throughout the years and more recently, perhaps would you consider the pandemic to be one of those drivers?

Genevieve: It&#39;s interesting. If you go all the way back to 1976, Norman Macrae of The Economist predicted that video chat would actually kill the office, that people would just work from home. Obviously, that didn&#39;t happen then, but the core technology for remote collaboration has actually been around for decades. But until the pandemic, most of us only experienced it in very specific contexts. Offices had dedicated video conferencing rooms and most ran on expensive proprietary systems. And then almost overnight, everything including literally the kitchen table had to be AV ready. The cultural norms shifted just as fast. Before the pandemic, it was perfectly fine to keep your camera off in a meeting, and now that&#39;s seen as disengaged or even rude, and that changes what normalized video conferencing and my hybrid meetings.

But in a rush to equip a suddenly remote workforce, we hit two big problems. Supply chain disruptions and a massive spike in demand. High-quality gear was hard to get so low-quality audio and video became the default. And here&#39;s a key point. We now know from research that audio quality matters more than video quality for meeting outcomes. You can run a meeting without video, but you can&#39;t run a meeting without clear audio. Audio is the gatekeeper of meaning. If people can&#39;t hear clearly, they can&#39;t understand you. And if they can&#39;t understand you, they can&#39;t trust you and they can&#39;t act on what you said. And no amount of sharp video can fix that.

Megan: Oh, true. It&#39;s fascinating, isn&#39;t it? And Chris, Shure and IDC recently released some research titled “The Hidden Influencer Rethinking Audio Could Impact Your Organization Today, Tomorrow, and Forever.” The research highlighted that importance of audio that Genevieve&#39;s talking about in today&#39;s increasingly virtual world. What did you glean from those results and did anything surprise you?

Chris: Yeah, well, the research certainly confirmed a lot of hunches we&#39;ve had through the years. When you think about a company like Shure that&#39;s been doing audio for 100 years, we just celebrated that anniversary this year.

Chris: Our legacy business is over more in the music and performance arena. And so just what Genevieve said in terms of, &quot;Yeah, you can have a performance and look at somebody, but that&#39;s like 10% of it, right? 90% is hearing that person sing, perform, and talk.&quot; We&#39;ve always, of course, from our perspective, understood that clean, clear, crisp audio is what is needed in any setting. When you translate what&#39;s happening on the stage into a meeting or collaboration space at a corporation, we&#39;ve thought that that is just equally as important.

And we always had this hunch that if people don&#39;t have the good audio, they&#39;re going to have fatigue, they&#39;re going to get a little disengaged, and the whole meeting is going to become quite unproductive. The research just really amplified that hunch for us because it really depicted the fact that people not only get kind of frustrated and disengaged, they might actually start to distrust what the other person with bad audio is saying or just cast it in a different light. And the degree to which that frustration becomes almost personal was very surprising to us. Like I said, it validated some hunches, but it really put an exclamation point on it for us.

Megan: And Genevieve, based on the research results, I understand that IDC pulled together some recommendations for organizations. What is it that leaders need to know and what is the biggest blind spot for them to overcome as well?

Genevieve: The biggest blind spot is this. If your microphone has poor audio quality, like Chris said, people will literally perceive you as less intelligent and less trustworthy. And by the way, that&#39;s not an opinion. It&#39;s what the science says. But yet, when we surveyed first time business buyers, the number one factor they used to choose audio gear was price. However, for repeat buyers, the top factor flipped to audio quality. My guess is they learn the lesson the hard way. The second blind spot is to Chris&#39;s point, it&#39;s the stress that bad audio creates. Poor sound forces your brain to work harder to decode what&#39;s being said. That&#39;s a cognitive load and it creates stress. And over a full day of meetings, that stress adds up. Now, we don&#39;t have long-term studies yet on the effects, but we do know that prolonged stress is something that every company should be working to reduce.

Good audio lightens that cognitive load. It keeps people engaged and it levels the playing field. Whether you&#39;re in a room or you&#39;re halfway across the world, and here&#39;s one that&#39;s often overlooked, bad audio can sabotage AI transcription tools. As AI becomes more and more central to everyday work, that starts to become really critical. If your audio isn&#39;t clear, the transcription won&#39;t be accurate. And there&#39;s a world of difference between working, for example, the consulting department and the insulting department, and that is an actual example from the field.

The bottom line is you fix the audio, you cut friction, you save time, and you make meetings more productive.

Megan: I mean, it&#39;s just a huge game changer, isn&#39;t it, really? I mean, and given that, Chris, in your experience across industries, are audio technologies being included in digital transformation strategies and also artificial intelligence implementation? Do we need a separate audio transformation perhaps?

Chris: Well, like I mentioned earlier, yes, people tend to initially focus on that visual platform, but increasingly the attention to audio is really coming into focus. And I&#39;d hate to tear apart audio as a separate sort of strategy because at the same time, we, as an audio expert, are trying to really seamlessly integrate audio into the rest of the ecosystem. It really does need to be put on an equal footing with the rest of the components in that ecosystem. And to Genevieve&#39;s point, as we are seeing audio and video systems with more AI functionalities, the importance of real-time translations that are being used, voice recognition, being able to attribute who said what in a meeting and take action items, it&#39;s really, I think starting to elevate the importance of that clear audio. And it&#39;s got to be part of a comprehensive, really collaboration plan that helps some company figure out what&#39;s their whole digital transformation about. It just really has to be included in that comprehensive plan, but put on equal footing with the rest of the components in that system.

Megan: Yeah, absolutely. And in the broader landscape, Genevieve, in terms of discussing the importance of audio quality, what have you noticed across research projects about the effects of good and bad audio, not only from that company perspective, but from employee and client perspectives as well?

Genevieve: Well, let&#39;s start with employees.

Genevieve: Bad audio adds friction you don&#39;t need, we&#39;ve talked about this. When you&#39;re straining to hear or make sense of what&#39;s being said, your brain is burning energy on decoding instead of contributing. That frustration, it builds up, and by the end of the day, it hurts productivity. From a company perspective, the stakes get even higher. Meetings are where decisions happen or at least where they&#39;re supposed to happen. And if people can&#39;t hear clearly, decisions get delayed, mistakes creep in, and the whole process slows down. Poor audio doesn&#39;t just waste time, it chips away at the ability to move quickly and confidently. And then there&#39;s the client experience. So whether it&#39;s in sales, customer service, or any external conversation, poor audio can make you sound less credible and yet less trustworthy. Again, that&#39;s not my opinion. That&#39;s what the research shows. So that&#39;s quite a big risk when you&#39;re trying to close a deal or solve a major problem.

The takeaway is good audio, it matters, it&#39;s a multiplier. It makes meetings more productive and it can help decisions happen faster and client interactions be stronger.

Megan: It&#39;s just so impactful, isn&#39;t it, in so many different ways. I mean, Chris, how are you seeing these research results reflected as companies work through digital and AI transformations? What is it that leaders need to understand about what is involved in audio implementation across their organization?

Chris: Well, like I said earlier, I do think that audio is finally maybe getting its place in the spotlight a little bit up there with our cousins over in the video side. Audio, it&#39;s not just a peripheral aspect anymore. It&#39;s a very integral part of that sort of comprehensive collaboration plan I was talking about earlier. And when we think about how can we contribute solutions that are really more easy to use for our end users, because if you create something complicated, we were talking about the days gone by of walking into a room. It&#39;s a very complicated system, and you need to find the right person that knows how to run it. Increasingly, you just need to have some plug and play kind of solutions. We&#39;re thinking about a more sustainable strategy for our solutions where we make really high-quality hardware. We&#39;ve done that account for a hundred years. People will come up to me and tell the story of the SM58 microphone they bought in 1980 and how they&#39;re still using it every day.

We know how to do that part of it. If somebody is willing to make that investment upfront, put some high-quality hardware into their system, then we are getting to the point now where updates can be handled via software downloads or cloud connectivity. And just really being able to provide sort of a sustainable solution for people over time.

More in our industry, we&#39;re collaborating with other industry partners to go in that direction, make something that&#39;s very simple for anybody to walk into a room or on their individual at home setup and do something pretty simple. And I think we have the right industry groups, the right industry associations that can help make sure that the ecosystems have the proper standards, the right kind of ways to make sure everything is interoperable within a system. We&#39;re all kind of heading in that direction with that end user in mind.

Megan: Fantastic. And when the internet of things was emerging, efforts began to create sort of these data ecosystems, it seems there&#39;s an argument to be made that we need audio ecosystems as well. I wonder, Chris, what might an audio ecosystem look like and what would be involved in implementation?

Chris: Well, I think it does have to be part of that bigger ecosystem I was just talking about where we do collaborate with others in industry and we try to make sure that we&#39;re all playing by the kind of same set of rules and protocols and standards and whatnot. And when you think about compatibility across all the devices that sit in a room or sit in your, again, maybe your at home setup, making sure that the audio quality is as good as it can be, that you can interoperate with everything else in the system. That&#39;s just become very paramount in our day-to-day work here. Your hardware has to be scalable like I just alluded to a moment ago. You have to figure out how you can integrate with existing technologies, different platforms.

We were joking when we came into this session that when you&#39;re going from the platform at your company, maybe you&#39;re on Teams and you go into a Zoom setting or you go into a Google setting, you really have to figure out how to adapt to all those different sort of platforms that are out there. I think the ecosystem that we&#39;re trying to build, we&#39;re trying to be on that equal footing with the rest of the components in that system. And people really do understand that if you want to have extra functionalities in meetings and you want to be able to transcribe or take notes and all of that, that audio is an absolutely critical piece.

Megan: Absolutely. And speaking of bit of all those different platforms and use cases, that sort of audio is so relevant to Genevieve that goes back to this idea of in audio one size does not fit all and needs may change. How can companies also plan their audio implementations to be flexible enough to meet current needs and to be able to grow with future advancements?

Genevieve: I&#39;m glad you asked this question. Even years after the pandemic, many companies, they&#39;re still trying to get the balance right between remote, in office, how to support it. But even if a company has a strict return to office in-person policy, the reality is that work still isn&#39;t going away for that company. They may have teams across cities or countries, clients and external stakeholders will have their own office preferences that they have to adapt to. Supporting hybrid work is actually becoming more important, not less. And our research shows that companies are leaning into, not away from, hybrid setups. About one third of companies are now redesigning or resizing office spaces every single year. For large organizations with multiple sites, staggered leases, that&#39;s a moving target. It&#39;s really important that they have audio solutions that can work before, during, after all of those changes that they&#39;re constantly making. And so that&#39;s where flexibility becomes really important. Companies need to buy not just for right now, but for the future.

And so here&#39;s IDC&#39;s kind of pro-tip, which is make sure as a company that you go with a provider that offers top-notch audio quality and also has strong partnerships and certifications with the big players and communications technology because that will save you money in the long run. Your systems will stay compatible, your investments will last longer, and you won&#39;t be scrambling when that next shift happens.

Megan: Of course. And speaking of building for the future, as companies begin to include sustainability in their company goals, Chris, I wonder how can audio play a role in those sustainability efforts and how might that play into perhaps the return on investment in building out a high-quality audio ecosystem?

Chris: Well, I totally agree with what Genevieve just said in terms of hybrid work is not going anywhere. You get all of those big headlines that talk about XYZ company telling people to get back into the office. And I saw a fantastic piece of data just last week that showed the percent of in-office hours of the American workers versus out-of-office remote kind of work. It has basically been flatlined since 2022. This is our new way of working. And of course, like Genevieve mentioned, you have people in all these different locations. And in a strange way, living through the pandemic did teach us that we can do some things by not having to hop on an airplane and travel to go somewhere. Certainly that helps with a more sustainable strategy over time, and you&#39;re saving on travel and able to get things done much more quickly.

And then from a product offering perspective, I&#39;ll go back to the vision I was painting earlier where we and others in our industry see that we can create great solid hardware platforms. We&#39;ve done it for decades, and now that advancements around AI and all of our software that enables products and everything else that has happened in the last probably decade, we can get enhancements and additions and new functionality to people in simpler ways on existing hardware. I think we&#39;re all careening down this path of having a much more sustainable ecosystem for all collaboration. It&#39;s really quite an exciting time, and that pays off with any company implementing a system, their ROI is going to be much better in the long run.

Megan: Absolutely. And Genevieve, what trends around sustainability are you seeing? What opportunities do you see for audio to play into those sustainability efforts going forward?

Genevieve: Yeah, similar to Chris. In some industries, there&#39;s still a belief that the best work happens when everyone&#39;s in the same room. And yes, face-to-face time is really important for building relationships, for brainstorming, for closing big deals, but it does come at a cost. The carbon footprint of daily commutes, the sales visits, the constant business travel. And then there&#39;s the basic consideration, as we&#39;ve talked about, of just pure practicality. The good news is with the right AV setup, especially high-quality audio, many of those interactions can happen virtually without losing effectiveness, as Chris said it, but our research shows it.

Our research shows that virtual meetings can be just as productive as in-person ones, and every commute or flight you avoid, of course makes a measurable sustainability impact. I don&#39;t think, personally, that the takeaway is replace all in-person meetings, but instead it&#39;s to be intentional. Use technology to make hybrid meetings seamless, and then be clear on which conversations truly require being in the same physical space. If you can strike that balance, you&#39;re not just making work more efficient, you&#39;re making it more sustainable, you&#39;re also making it more inclusive, and you&#39;re making it more resilient.

Megan: Such an important point. And let&#39;s close with a future forward look, if we can. Genevieve, what innovations or advancements in the audio field are you most excited to see to come to fruition, and what potential interesting use cases do you see on the horizon?

Genevieve: I&#39;m especially interested in how AI and audio are converging. We&#39;re now seeing AI that can identify and isolate human voices in noisy environments. For example, right now, there are some jets flying overhead. It&#39;s very loud in here, but I suspect you may not even know that that&#39;s happening.

Genevieve: Right. That technology, it&#39;s pulling voices forward so that conversations like ours are crystal clear. And that&#39;s a big deal, especially as companies invest more and more in AI tools, especially for that translating, transcribing and summarizing meetings. But as we&#39;ve talked before, AI is only as good as the audio it hears. If the sound is poor or a word gets misheard, the meaning can shift entirely. And sometimes that&#39;s just inconvenient, or it can even be funny. But in really high stakes settings, like healthcare for example, a single mis-transcribed word can have serious consequences. So that&#39;s why our position as high quality audio is critical and it&#39;s necessary for making AI powered communication accurate, trustworthy, and useful because when the input is clean, the output can actually live up to its promise.

Megan: Fantastic. And Chris, finally, what are you most excited to see developed? What advancements are you most looking forward to seeing?

Chris: Well, I really do believe that this is one of the most exciting times that I know I&#39;ve lived through in my career. Just the pace of how fast technology is moving, the sudden emergence of all things AI. I was actually in a roundtable session of CEOs yesterday from lots of different industries, and the facilitator was talking about change management internally in companies as you&#39;re going through all of these technology shifts and some of the fear that people have around AI and things like that. And the facilitator asked each of us to give one word that describes how we&#39;re feeling right now. And the first CEO that went used the word dread. And that absolutely floored me because you enter into these eras with some skepticism and trying to figure out how to make things work and go down the right path. But my word was truly optimism.

When I look at all the ways that we are able to deliver better audio to people more quickly, there&#39;s so many opportunities in front of us. We&#39;re working on things outside of AI like algorithms that Genevieve just mentioned that filter out the bad sounds that you don&#39;t want entering into a meeting. We&#39;ve been doing that for quite a long time now. There&#39;s also opportunities to do real time audio improvements, enhancements, make audio more personal for people. How do they want to be able to very simply, through voice commands perhaps, adjust their audio? There shouldn&#39;t have to be a whole lot of techie settings that come along with our solutions.

We should be able to provide improved accessibility and a little bit more equitable meeting experience for people. And we&#39;re looking at tech technology solutions around immersive audio. How can you maybe feel like you&#39;re a bit more engaged in the meeting, kind of creating some realistic virtual experiences, if you will. There&#39;s just so many opportunities in front of us, and I can just picture a day when you walk into a room and you tell the room, &quot;Hey, call Genevieve. We&#39;re going to have a meeting for an hour, and we might need to have Megan on call to come in at a certain time.&quot;

And all of this will just be very automatic, very seamless, and we&#39;ll be able to see each other and talk at the same time. And this isn&#39;t years away. This is happening really, really quickly. And I do think it&#39;s a really exciting time for audio and just all together collaboration in our industry.

Megan: Absolutely. Sounds like there&#39;s plenty of reason to be optimistic. Thank you both so much.That was Chris Schyvinck, President and CEO at Shure.

Welcome to Kenya’s Great Carbon Valley: a bold new gamble to fight climate change

In June last year, startup Octavia Carbon began running a high-stakes test in the small town of Gilgil in south-central Kenya. It’s harnessing some of the excess energy generated by vast clouds of steam under the Earth’s surface to power prototypes of a machine that promises to remove carbon dioxide from the air in a manner that the company says is efficient, affordable, and—crucially—scalable.The company’s long-term vision is undoubtedly ambitious—it wants to prove that direct air capture (DAC), as the process is known, can be a powerful tool to help the world keep temperatures from rising to ever more dangerous levels.

But DAC is also a controversial technology, unproven at scale and wildly expensive to operate. On top of that, Kenya’s Maasai people have plenty of reasons to distrust energy companies. Read the full story.

AI Wrapped: The 14 AI terms you couldn’t avoid in 2025

If the past 12 months have taught us anything, it’s that the AI hype train is showing no signs of slowing. It’s hard to believe that at the beginning of the year, DeepSeek had yet to turn the entire industry on its head, Meta was better known for trying (and failing) to make the metaverse cool than for its relentless quest to dominate superintelligence, and vibe coding wasn’t a thing.

If that’s left you feeling a little confused, fear not. Our writers have taken a look back over the AI terms that dominated the year, for better or worse. Read the full list.

How aging clocks can help us understand why we age—and if we can reverse itWrinkles and gray hairs aside, it can be difficult to know how well—or poorly—someone’s body is truly aging. A person who develops age-related diseases earlier in life, or has other biological changes associated with aging, might be considered “biologically older” than a similar-age person who doesn’t have those changes. Some 80-year-olds will be weak and frail, while others are fit and active.Over the past decade, scientists have been uncovering new methods of looking at the hidden ways our bodies are aging. And what they’ve found is changing our understanding of aging itself. Read the full story.—Jessica Hamzelou

In an industry in constant flux, sticking your neck out to predict what’s coming next may seem reckless. (AI bubble? What AI bubble?) But for the last few years we’ve done just that—and we’re doing it again.

How did we do last time? We picked five hot AI trends to look out for in 2025, including what we called generative virtual playgrounds, a.k.a world models (check: From Google DeepMind’s Genie 3 to World Labs’s Marble, tech that can generate realistic virtual environments on the fly keeps getting better and better); so-called reasoning models (check: Need we say more? Reasoning models have fast become the new paradigm for best-in-class problem solving); a boom in AI for science (check: OpenAI is now following Google DeepMind by setting up a dedicated team to focus on just that); AI companies that are cozier with national security (check: OpenAI reversed position on the use of its technology for warfare to sign a deal with the defense-tech startup Anduril to help it take down battlefield drones); and legitimate competition for Nvidia (check, kind of: China is going all in on developing advanced AI chips, but Nvidia’s dominance still looks unassailable—for now at least).

So what’s coming in 2026? Here are our big bets for the next 12 months.

The last year shaped up as a big one for Chinese open-source models. In January, DeepSeek released R1, its open-source reasoning model, and shocked the world with what a relatively small firm in China could do with limited resources. By the end of the year, “DeepSeek moment” had become a phrase frequently tossed around by AI entrepreneurs, observers, and builders—an aspirational benchmark of sorts.

It was the first time many people realized they could get a taste of top-tier AI performance without going through OpenAI, Anthropic, or Google.

Open-weight models like R1 allow anyone to download a model and run it on their own hardware. They are also more customizable, letting teams tweak models through techniques like distillation and pruning. This stands in stark contrast to the “closed” models released by major American firms, where core capabilities remain proprietary and access is often expensive.

As a result, Chinese models have become an easy choice. Reports by CNBC and Bloomberg suggest that startups in the US have increasingly recognized and embraced what they can offer.

One popular group of models is Qwen, created by Alibaba, the company behind China’s largest e-commerce platform, Taobao. Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct alone has 8.85 million downloads, making it one of the most widely used pretrained LLMs. The Qwen family spans a wide range of model sizes alongside specialized versions tuned for math, coding, vision, and instruction-following, a breadth that has helped it become an open-source powerhouse.

Other Chinese AI firms that were previously unsure about committing to open source are following DeepSeek’s playbook. Standouts include Zhipu’s GLM and Moonshot’s Kimi. The competition has also pushed American firms to open up, at least in part. In August, OpenAI released its first open-source model. In November, the Allen Institute for AI, a Seattle-based nonprofit, released its latest open-source model, Olmo 3.

Even amid growing US-China antagonism, Chinese AI firms’ near-unanimous embrace of open source has earned them goodwill in the global AI community and a long-term trust advantage. In 2026, expect more Silicon Valley apps to quietly ship on top of Chinese open models, and look for the lag between Chinese releases and the Western frontier to keep shrinking—from months to weeks, and sometimes less.

T​​he battle over regulating artificial intelligence is heading for a showdown. On December 11, President Donald Trump signed an executive order aiming to neuter state AI laws, a move meant to handcuff states from keeping the growing industry in check. In 2026, expect more political warfare. The White House and states will spar over who gets to govern the booming technology, while AI companies wage a fierce lobbying campaign to crush regulations, armed with the narrative that a patchwork of state laws will smother innovation and hobble the US in the AI arms race against China.

Under Trump’s executive order, states may fear being sued or starved federal funding if they clash with his vision for light-touch regulation. Big Democratic states like California—which just enacted the nation’s first frontier AI law requiring companies to publish safety testing for their AI models—will take the fight to court, arguing that only Congress can override state laws. But states that can’t afford to lose federal funding, or fear getting in Trump’s crosshairs, might fold. Still, expect to see more state lawmaking on hot-button issues, especially where Trump’s order gives states a green light to legislate. With chatbots accused of triggering teen suicides and data centers sucking up more and more energy, states will face mounting public pressure to push for guardrails.

In place of state laws, Trump promises to work with Congress to establish a federal AI law. Don’t count on it. Congress failed to pass a moratorium on state legislation twice in 2025, and we aren’t holding out hope that it will deliver its own bill this year.

AI companies like OpenAI and Meta will continue to deploy powerful super-PACs to support political candidates who back their agenda and target those who stand in their way. On the other side, super-PACs supporting AI regulation will build their own war chests to counter. Watch them duke it out at next year’s midterm elections.

The further AI advances, the more people will fight to steer its course, and 2026 will be another year of regulatory tug-of-war—with no end in sight.

Imagine a world in which you have a personal shopper at your disposal 24-7—an expert who can instantly recommend a gift for even the trickiest-to-buy-for friend or relative, or trawl the web to draw up a list of the best bookcases available within your tight budget. Better yet, they can analyze a kitchen appliance’s strengths and weaknesses, compare it with its seemingly identical competition, and find you the best deal. Then once you’re happy with their suggestion, they’ll take care of the purchasing and delivery details too.But this ultra-knowledgeable shopper isn’t a clued-up human at all—it’s a chatbot. This is no distant prediction, either. Salesforce recently said it anticipates that AI will drive $263 billion in online purchases this holiday season. That’s some 21% of all orders. And experts are betting on AI-enhanced shopping becoming even bigger business within the next few years. By 2030, between $3 trillion and $5 trillion annually will be made from agentic commerce, according to research from the consulting firm McKinsey.

Unsurprisingly, AI companies are already heavily invested in making purchasing through their platforms as frictionless as possible. Google’s Gemini app can now tap into the company’s powerful Shopping Graph data set of products and sellers, and can even use its agentic technology to call stores on your behalf. Meanwhile, back in November, OpenAI announced a ChatGPT shopping feature capable of rapidly compiling buyer’s guides, and the company has struck deals with Walmart, Target, and Etsy to allow shoppers to buy products directly within chatbot interactions.

Expect plenty more of these kinds of deals to be struck within the next year as consumer time spent chatting with AI keeps on rising, and web traffic from search engines and social media continues to plummet.

I’m going to hedge here, right out of the gate. It’s no secret that large language models spit out a lot of nonsense. Unless it’s with monkeys-and-typewriters luck, LLMs won’t discover anything by themselves. But LLMs do still have the potential to extend the bounds of human knowledge.

We got a glimpse of how this could work in May, when Google DeepMind revealed AlphaEvolve, a system that used the firm’s Gemini LLM to come up with new algorithms for solving unsolved problems. The breakthrough was to combine Gemini with an evolutionary algorithm that checked its suggestions, picked the best ones, and fed them back into the LLM to make them even better.

Google DeepMind used AlphaEvolve to come up with more efficient ways to manage power consumption by data centers and Google’s TPU chips. Those discoveries are significant but not game-changing. Yet. Researchers at Google DeepMind are now pushing their approach to see how far it will go.

And others have been quick to follow their lead. A week after AlphaEvolve came out, Asankhaya Sharma, an AI engineer in Singapore, shared OpenEvolve, an open-source version of Google DeepMind’s tool. In September, the Japanese firm Sakana AI released a version of the software called SinkaEvolve. And in November, a team of US and Chinese researchers revealed AlphaResearch, which they claim improves on one of AlphaEvolve’s already better-than-human math solutions.

There are alternative approaches too. For example, researchers at the University of Colorado Denver are trying to make LLMs more inventive by tweaking the way so-called reasoning models work. They have drawn on what cognitive scientists know about creative thinking in humans to push reasoning models toward solutions that are more outside the box than their typical safe-bet suggestions.

Hundreds of companies are spending billions of dollars looking for ways to get AI to crack unsolved math problems, speed up computers, and come up with new drugs and materials. Now that AlphaEvolve has shown what’s possible with LLMs, expect activity on this front to ramp up fast.

For a while, lawsuits against AI companies were pretty predictable: Rights holders like authors or musicians would sue companies that trained AI models on their work, and the courts generally found in favor of the tech giants. AI’s upcoming legal battles will be far messier.

The fights center on thorny, unresolved questions: Can AI companies be held liable for what their chatbots encourage people to do, as when they help teens plan suicides? If a chatbot spreads patently false information about you, can its creator be sued for defamation? If companies lose these cases, will insurers shun AI companies as clients?

In 2026, we’ll start to see the answers to these questions, in part because some notable cases will go to trial (the family of a teen who died by suicide will bring OpenAI to court in November).

At the same time, the legal landscape will be further complicated by President Trump’s executive order from December—see Michelle’s item above for more details on the brewing regulatory storm.

No matter what, we’ll see a dizzying array of lawsuits in all directions (not to mention some judges even turning to AI amid the deluge).

The experimental model won&#39;t compete with the biggest and best, but it could tell us why they behave in weird ways—and how trustworthy they really are.

Four ways to think about this year&#39;s reckoning

They managed to cut the size of the AI reasoning model by more than half—and claim it can now answer politically sensitive questions once off limits in Chinese AI systems.

A conversation with a chatbot can shift people&#39;s political views—but the most persuasive models also spread the most misinformation.

            <div id="article-text">For years, the tech industry equated success with scale. Bigger stages, larger crowds, more logos, more panels, more noise. Five thousand people became ten thousand. Ten thousand became the goal.

Somewhere along the way, that stopped making sense.

Founders and executives didn’t announce a boycott. They simply stopped showing up.

What we see today is not a rejection of events, but a correction in how people who actually run companies choose to spend their time. The shift is subtle, but consistent. Fewer large conferences. More small, curated gatherings. More closed rooms. More dinners. More tables of twelve.

Big tech events struggle because they optimize for visibility, not usefulness. A founder does not need three days of generic content, dozens of panels with no real interaction, or networking sessions where relevance is left to chance.

At scale, everything becomes superficial by default. Conversations shorten. Access disappears. The signal is drowned by the format itself.

What founders look for instead is simple. Context. Trust. Direct access. Conversations without performance. The kind of environment where people can speak honestly, not publicly.

Even when larger conferences still make sense, there is a clear psychological ceiling. Around one thousand participants, in exceptional cases. Beyond that point, quality becomes impossible to control. The event stops being a place where decisions are made and turns into a product designed for mass consumption.

And tech, especially at the founder and executive level, no longer behaves like a mass industry. It behaves like a precision one.

This is why smaller, niche conferences outperform larger ones on every meaningful metric. Ten relevant people in a room will always create more value than a thousand irrelevant ones in a hall.

At a small table, access is natural. No one needs to chase anyone. Trust forms faster. Real conversations happen because there is no audience to impress.

The most important discussions in tech have never happened on stage. They happen before the lights turn on and after the microphones are off.

In parallel with this shift, we have been preparing a private community limited to one thousand founders and executives. It is strictly invite only. Not a platform. Not a public group. Not designed for scale. Designed for relevance. Quality is protected precisely by limitation.

One thing we can say publicly is that TNW will return with an event in 2026. Details, format, and the official launch will be announced soon, but not here. What matters is that this return will not mirror the old model. It will reflect how the industry actually operates today.

Big events are not disappearing. They are simply no longer where important decisions are made.

Across the industry, the shift is already happening. Smaller rooms. Sharper conversations. People who actually need to be there.

            <div id="article-text">Five stars used to mean something. People still read reviews before buying software. They just don’t trust them the way they used to. And no, this isn’t about fake reviews or obvious scams. Those are easy to spot. The real problem is more uncomfortable. The review economy didn’t collapse. It slowly drifted away from its original purpose.

User reviews began as authentic buyer guidance, but they’ve morphed into strategic assets for businesses. Scroll through any app store or e-commerce site: everything is “top-rated” and lavished with praise. If every product gleams with a 4.8/5 rating, those stars start to lose their meaning.

Consumers aren’t fooled, in fact, the share of people who trust online reviews as much as personal recommendations plummeted from nearly 80% in 2020 to just 42% in 2025

We read the glowing comments, but we’ve learned to read between the lines.

TNW City Coworking space - Where your best work happens

A workspace designed for growth, collaboration, and endless networking opportunities in the heart of tech.

It’s not hard to see why trust has eroded. Companies have figured out that great reviews drive sales, so they’ve turned the whole system into a numbers game. High ratings aren’t just social proof now, they’re a growth tactic.  In other words, more stars = more money. So of course businesses are chasing stars like their life depends on it. And in a way, it does.

Behind the scenes, many companies actively engineer their review scores. One common tactic is to time the ask just right. For instance, some businesses send out a Net Promoter Score (NPS) survey to gauge your sentiment “How likely are you to recommend us?”

If you rate them a 9 or 10 (a promoter), you’re immediately nudged to post a public review. If you give a lukewarm or low score, the feedback form quietly thanks you and never mentions writing a review at all.

Only the happiest customers get the gentle push to “Share your experience!” This practice is so widespread it even has a name: “review gating.”

It’s essentially filtering which customers get invited to leave a review based on their initial feedback. Platforms officially frown on it (Google outright forbids “selectively soliciting positive reviews”), but behind closed doors it remains a growth hacker’s favorite trick.

Then there’s the outright incentivization. Perhaps you’ve received an email offering a discount, gift card, or free month of service in exchange for writing a review. It’s framed as a thank-you for your time, of course – “Share your honest feedback and get 10% off your next purchase!” – but the intent is clear.

In an economy of fake praise, even regulators have had to step in to remind everyone that trust isn’t a commodity to be bought. Companies know how to play the game from the other side too: suppressing negativity.

Unhappy customer feedback is quietly diverted to support teams or private channels, where it can be resolved (or simply contained) out of public view. The result is a skewed reality, a glossy wall of five-star testimonials that obscure any hint of dissatisfaction. It’s a great sales tool. It’s terrible for the truth.

Why go to such lengths to manicure the ratings? Because the platforms themselves reward it. The algorithms that sort and highlight products aren’t trying to surface the most truthful review; they’re trying to maximize engagement and conversion.

High ratings and large volumes of reviews make people more likely to click “Buy Now.” That means more conversion for sellers and more commission for the marketplace. In other words, the algorithm is biased toward whatever boosts the platform’s monetization metrics.

A bunch of five-star reviews isn’t just ego bait,  it’s algorithm bait.

Think about it: products with a 4.7-star average and hundreds of reviews tend to appear at the top of search results and recommendation lists. They convert better, so the system pushes them more.

More visibility leads to more sales, which reinforces the high ranking. It’s a feedback loop powered by positive feedback (pun intended). If a vendor can game their way into that virtuous cycle, via perfectly timed prompts or purchased praise, the platform’s code will happily amplify them.

Authenticity doesn’t earn you a top slot; performance does. The incentive is clear: keep it positive, and keep it plentiful. In the review economy, volume and sentiment are king.

Worse, some marketplaces have blurred the line between genuine high-rated listings and paid placement. It’s an open secret that many platforms offer sponsored spots or pay-to-play schemes, think “featured” placements, ads masquerading as top picks, or vendor subscriptions that subtly boost visibility.

Money talks, even if it speaks over the voice of authentic customer feedback. (To be fair, a few holdouts still refuse to monetize their review rankings or sell out their star system, but they’re the exception, not the rule).

Consumers aren’t sitting idly by in this charade. We’ve become savvy at sniffing out over-polished BS. The modern buyer knows how the game is played, and many are adapting their behavior to cope with the broken review system.

First, there’s a migration of trust to private networks and off-platform channels. Instead of relying on the star-average on a marketplace, people turn to friends, colleagues, and niche communities for real advice.

Think about the last time you were unsure about a purchase, maybe you shot a quick message to a group chat, or asked in a private Slack channel, “Hey, has anyone used this product? Is it actually any good?” Personal recommendations feel reliable again, precisely because they’re not part of the public review circus.

Second, savvy consumers cross-check everything. Rather than trusting one site’s reviews, they compare across multiple sources, the product might be 4.8 on the official store, but what’s it rated elsewhere?

Is there a discrepancy between the slick website testimonials and the chatter on Reddit? More often than not, shoppers now triangulate information. In fact, three out of four people use two or more sites when reading reviews, rather than putting all their faith in one platform’s word. We instinctively seek a consensus of truth across the noise.

Finally, many have decided the best judge is themselves. “Try before you buy” has made a comeback as a defense against dubious reviews. Free trials, freemium tiers, generous return policies, consumers leverage them all to test products firsthand.

If a software platform promises the world in its curated testimonials, a savvy buyer will take the 14-day free trial and see if it lives up to the hype. In sectors like enterprise software, where choices are costly and critical, buyers might run a pilot program or proof-of-concept rather than trust glossy case studies. Essentially, experience has become the new review.

All this has serious implications for platforms and software marketplaces. These businesses built their empires on user-generated trust, turning customer opinion into a key part of the shopping experience.

If that trust evaporates, the model cracks. We’re already seeing the early signs: users skipping the review tab, or treating every five-star rating with a healthy dose of skepticism.

If the review economy continues on its current path, platforms risk becoming mere transaction processors rather than trust brokers.

For the marketplaces, this is both a crisis and an opportunity. The crisis is obvious: loss of credibility. If people no longer believe what they read on your platform, they’ll seek validation elsewhere, and your influence over purchase decisions diminishes.

But the opportunity lies in reform. Platforms could double down on authenticity as a feature, verifying purchases, cracking down harder on fraudulent and incentivized reviews, and highlighting more qualitative, nuanced feedback instead of simple star counts.

There’s even a chance to innovate with new trust signals (some are experimenting with things like verified buyer badges, AI analysis for suspicious patterns, or weighted ratings that account for reviewer reputation). The platforms that find ways to genuinely restore faith in their review systems will win back weary consumers. Those that don’t will see their communities drift away, bit by bit.

Importantly, not all platforms have given in to the dark side. A handful still refuse pay-for-play tactics, no paid reviews, no under-the-table boosting of rankings for advertisers.

These holdouts demonstrate that integrity in reviews is possible, even if it means slower growth in the short term.

In the end, the broken review economy is forcing a rebalance of how we decide what to trust. Buyers are adapting, finding new ways to cut through the noise. And the platforms that once thrived on being the ultimate source of truth in purchasing may have to rethink their approach if they want to stay relevant.

Trust, once lost, is hard to regain. The five-star system doesn’t shine as bright as it used to; perhaps it’s time for the next evolution in how we share and earn trust online.

            <div id="article-text">2025 was the year technology stopped being tomorrow’s promise and became today’s anchor. What began as a surge in generative AI and platform innovation two years prior crystallized this year into concrete shifts in how people work, governing bodies legislate, and markets invest. Across continents and industries, the arc of technology bent toward practical impact, regulatory reality, and economic weight!

At the heart of the year’s story was artificial intelligence’s jump from novelty to infrastructure. LLMs and multimodal models moved beyond demos into everyday workflows, influencing how documents are written, campaigns are conceived, products designed, and code generated.

Enterprises that once hesitated began deploying AI tools at scale, with early adopters reporting measurable productivity gains by integrating copilots into core processes, a trend visible in surveys showing widespread adoption among software professionals.

This editorial isn’t a chronicle of every press release.

It’s a reflection on how 2025, at the crossroads of technology, governance, and economic strategy, brought about a series of inflection points that will shape the next era of creation, competition, and control.

TNW City Coworking space - Where your best work happens

A workspace designed for growth, collaboration, and endless networking opportunities in the heart of tech.

OpenAI’s release of GPT-5 in August pushed the boundaries of what AI could do, delivering notable gains in coding, math, and multimodal understanding. But unlike the jaw-dropping debut of ChatGPT a couple years prior, this new generation of foundation models arrived to a more measured reception.

Tech leaders and investors had begun asking harder questions: beyond impressive demos, could these models drive real products and revenue?

Google’s answer was Gemini 3, launched in November as its “most intelligent model” and immediately woven into Google’s flagship product, Search. For the first time, an AI model upgrade wasn’t just about boastful leaderboard scores, it was about transforming user experience.

Typing a query into Google now often meant receiving an AI-generated synthesis instead of the familiar list of links, a sea change in how information is delivered. Google even unveiled a Gemini “agent” that could execute multi-step tasks like booking travel or organizing email, hinting at a future where AI acts more like a digital butler than a chatbox.

Anthropic’s Claude 4 model, for instance, gained a strong following among developers by expanding how much it could handle at once, processing entire codebases with tens of thousands of lines, rather than by producing viral one-liners.

AI grew up in 2025: it was still improving at breakneck speed, but it also had to earn its keep in real products and justify the billion-dollar bets fueling its rise.

Driving this AI explosion was a parallel leap in hardware. The hunger for AI computers in 2025 was insatiable, and chipmakers raced to deliver.

NVIDIA, whose GPUs had become the era’s essential infrastructure, rolled out its new Blackwell architecture with chips like the B200 that boasted up to 3× the training speed of its predecessor. Cloud data centers around the world scrambled to deploy these to keep up with demand from model training and inference.

Rival chipmakers weren’t idle either: AMD and a cadre of startups pushed innovative AI accelerators, while even Intel signaled ambitions to catch up, reportedly exploring an acquisition of AI chip designer SambaNova.

Perhaps most tellingly, tech giants themselves started designing silicon tailored for AI workloads, recognizing that owning the chip means owning the future of computing.

Beyond AI chips, consumer hardware saw its own milestones. After years of anticipation, augmented reality glasses and mixed-reality headsets finally had their moment, sort of.

Apple’s Vision Pro headset, unveiled in late 2023, reached select markets in 2024; by 2025 developers were crafting the first wave of immersive apps. However, mass adoption lagged due to the device’s sky-high price and bulky format.

Competitors like Meta’s Quest line offered cheaper VR headsets and modest improvements, but the “metaverse” hype of yesteryear largely fizzled out, users and investors had shifted their excitement to generative AI and tangible productivity tools.

Smartphones and laptops in 2025 continued incremental improvements (faster Apple M3/M4 chips, foldable screens becoming more common), yet it was clear the next paradigm shift in personal tech was still on the horizon.

Even so, one hardware frontier made concrete progress: quantum computing. Industry leaders like IBM and Google demonstrated prototype systems with ever-larger qubit counts and made strides in error correction, inching closer to viable quantum machines.

These advances, while esoteric to the public, underscored a broader theme, from AI accelerators to quantum chips, the machinery under the hood of tech was evolving rapidly to enable the software of tomorrow.

If 2025 proved anything, it’s that technology no longer operates above the law. This was the year regulators moved from intent to enforcement, with Europe leading the charge.

After years of debate, the EU’s Artificial Intelligence Act came into force, becoming the world’s first complex AI law. From February, certain “unacceptable risk” uses, such as social scoring and real-time biometric surveillance, were banned outright.

By August, transparency rules followed, forcing companies to label AI-generated content and comply with new obligations for general-purpose models. The signal was unmistakable: in Europe, the era of unchecked AI was over.

Companies now face audits, penalties, and real consequences if their systems cross legal or ethical lines, a regulatory moment European officials openly compared to GDPR’s impact on data privacy.

The pressure didn’t stop with AI. In 2025, regulators also went after the gatekeepers. The EU’s Digital Markets Act forced long-resistant changes from Big Tech, most notably when Apple opened the iPhone to third-party app stores and sideloading in Europe, dismantling a 15-year walled garden.

At the same time, enforcement of the Digital Services Act intensified. Platforms were scrutinized for how they handle disinformation, with companies like X warned or penalized during periods of geopolitical tension. In response, social networks expanded moderation teams, adjusted algorithms, and exposed more of their inner workings to researchers.

The US issued an AI executive order and signaled tougher enforcement through agencies like the FTC, while states stepped in, including New York’s law requiring mental-health warnings on addictive social features.

In China, new draft rules targeted AI systems designed for human-like interaction, tightening licensing and ideological oversight. By the end of the year, the freewheeling phase of tech disruption had given way to something more restrained. The question was no longer whether regulation would catch up, but how deeply it would reshape innovation itself.

The platform shake-up that began in 2023 gathered real momentum in 2025, as both companies and users adjusted to a post-pandemic, AI-saturated reality.

Nowhere was this clearer than in social media. Elon Musk’s X, which entered the decade with noise and bravado, found itself on the defensive. Meta’s Threads, initially dismissed after an early spike, steadily closed the gap, nearing parity with X in daily mobile users by mid-year.

X’s audience shrank as policy whiplash and leadership churn eroded confidence, and while its remaining users were still deeply engaged, the era of unquestioned Twitter dominance was over. Disenchanted users scattered across a fragmented landscape, from Meta’s polished Threads to decentralized alternatives like Bluesky and Mastodon, breaking the old Facebook–Instagram–Twitter equilibrium.

The recalibration extended well beyond social feeds.

Major platforms retooled around changing habits: Google reshaped Search around generative answers to fend off AI assistants and algorithmic discovery, while Microsoft pushed its Copilot deeper into Windows, Office, and Bing, betting on “AI inside” as a platform reset.

Everyday behavior shifted too. Smarter voice and chat assistants returned to daily use, handling emails, refunds, and scheduling with little friction. At the same time, screen fatigue set in. Digital-detox travel gained traction, and younger users gravitated toward apps that promised less algorithmic pressure and more human curation. Even streaming came full circle.

After years of fragmentation, providers began rebundling services, offering combined video, music, and gaming packages that looked suspiciously like cable TV reborn, a reminder that while technology moves forward, user preferences often move in cycles.

Amid the gains and momentum, 2025 also became a year of reckoning. As AI systems spread, society began grappling with their cultural and ethical cost. Creators who once marveled at generative tools started pushing back, arguing that their work had been absorbed without consent or compensation.

A wave of lawsuits moved through US courts, with authors accusing companies like OpenAI, Meta, and Google of scraping books and articles to train models. By year’s end, the message was unmistakable: if AI is built on human creativity, many believe its rewards can no longer flow in one direction alone.

Public trust in technology was also tested by a rise in malicious uses and misuses. In the financial domain, sophisticated deepfake scams caused real damage. The frequency of such incidents spiked sharply; cybersecurity firms reported a 3000% increase in deepfake-related fraud over two years, and authorities scrambled to educate businesses on new verification practices.

Misinformation continued to be a menace: during elections and conflicts, AI-generated fake images and videos spread on social media, forcing newsrooms to set up rapid-response fact-checking teams.

Encouragingly, 2025 also saw growth in countermeasures, from better deepfake detection algorithms to nascent standards for cryptographic content authentication (the Coalition for Content Provenance, including major publishers and tech platforms, expanded efforts to watermark authentic media).

Still, the information ecosystem remained fraught, as even savvy citizens found it ever harder to tell the truth from fabrication online.

And then there’s the human element: how all this tech is affecting everyday lives and livelihoods. Workplace AI adoption soared this year; tools like Microsoft 365 Copilot and a host of AI assistants became common on office desktops. Studies showed productivity boosts but also raised concerns about workers becoming overly reliant on AI suggestions.

Meanwhile, fears of automation resurfaced in certain sectors, for example, as chatbots took over more customer service and code-generation tools improved, professionals in call centers and junior programming positions wondered about long-term job security.

These anxieties fueled calls for new approaches to education and training, so that the workforce of 2030 will be prepared for more creative, complex tasks that AI can’t easily handle.

Lovable (Stockholm, Sweden) came as one of the most remarkable AI software stories of the year, for me. What began as an open-source project evolved into a commercial platform that lets users build fully functional websites and apps using plain-language prompts, no traditional coding required.

This approach, known in the industry as “vibe coding,” turns ideas into production-ready software simply by describing what you want in natural language.

Lovable’s growth in 2025 was extraordinary by any measure. Eight months after its launch, the company hit over $100 million in annual recurring revenue and raised a $200 million Series A at a roughly $1.8 billion valuation, making it one of Europe’s fastest-growing software startups ever.

By year’s end, Lovable had secured $330 million in Series B funding at about a $6.6 billion valuation, and was rapidly scaling globally.

What makes Lovable meaningful beyond the numbers is what it represents: a shift in how software is built. It demonstrated that AI can democratize development, giving power to non-technical founders, creators, and teams to go from concept to product without traditional engineering barriers.

In an industry long centered on specialized skills and team structures, Lovable’s rise suggested a future where natural language becomes the primary interface to software creation.

On a more hopeful note, 2025 showed signs of a maturing tech culture. Ethical design moved from talking point to practice. Major platforms began experimenting with limits, turning off infinite scroll for teens, adding prompts that nudged users to pause, and treating “time well spent” as a real metric rather than a slogan.

In AI, transparency gained ground. Under pressure from regulators and researchers, companies like OpenAI and Google disclosed more about how their models are trained and where they fall short.

Researchers formed new alliances to share safety techniques, and a second global AI Safety Summit brought dozens of countries together around questions of alignment and control.

None of it amounted to binding rules, but it marked a shift in tone: even the architects of powerful systems openly acknowledged the need for restraint.

Taken together, these moments made 2025 a turning point. For years, technology had surged ahead of the institutions meant to guide it. This year, that gap began to close.

The breakthroughs were real and transformative, but so were the responses to them: laws passed, norms reset, alliances formed. If 2024 was the year the world grasped the power of generative AI, 2025 was the year it began deciding how that power should be used.

The story of technology is no longer just about what can be built, but about how it fits into the lives it shapes, and who gets to decide that fit.

            <div id="article-text">My name is Alexandru Stan, and this article continues the dialogue I began following the acquisition of TNW.

Following the recent transaction, TNW Spaces remains with the Financial Times, while we continue the mission of the website, the events, and the global community.

We already have a dedicated team at tekpon operating the platform, events, and community initiatives. Our objective is to expand and strengthen the team as TNW accelerates its next chapter.

TNW is already a global media platform with millions of readers. We’re not starting over. We are building forward.

TNW City Coworking space - Where your best work happens

A workspace designed for growth, collaboration, and endless networking opportunities in the heart of tech.

Technology is entering a decisive stage: AI is reshaping workflows, distribution is shifting, capital is becoming more selective, and founders are expected to demonstrate value rather than potential.

The world doesn’t need more noise.
It needs clarity, execution, and access to trustworthy knowledge and people.

TNW will serve that need through editorial independence, real expertise, and community-built intelligence.

Success for TNW looks like this: more accurate understanding, faster access to verified knowledge, and direct pathways from insight to action.

I’ve been an entrepreneur since 2007, building in B2B SaaS, marketplaces, and scalable systems. I believe deeply in servant leadership. Without people, I am zero.

I lead two private networks grounded in practice rather than theory:

These groups ensure TNW remains rooted in lived experience, informed by operators, not commentators.

Our mission is to build the most trusted European tech media platform with global reach, focused on practical innovation, responsible scaling, and transparency.

We will continue to host events across Europe’s major capitals including Paris, London, Berlin, Amsterdam, and Monaco.

These will not be festivals. We are introducing a concept validated through tekpon events: curated gatherings built for meaningful relationships, deep content, and tangible business outcomes.

In 2026, we return to Amsterdam for a special edition centered on AI among other fields. We will explore technologies and strategies shaping the future of work and business:

The editorial focus remains European, while the audience is global.

AI is not a threat to publishing. It is the infrastructure of the next generation of content and knowledge.

At TNW, we will use AI to accelerate research, enable personalized intelligence, reduce noise and bias, and amplify high-quality human expertise. Technology assists. Human judgment remains central.

Because this moment in Europe matters.
Because founders here are ready to scale responsibly.
Because independent media with integrity is rare.
Because innovation deserves a platform built around people, not hype.

TNW will continue its legacy with a renewed emphasis on contribution, execution, and community built through trust.

If you are building, scaling, or researching the next wave of technology, I invite you to engage with us, contribute insights, and participate in shaping the conversation.

The next era begins now. Let’s shape it together.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Most engineering leaders cannot answer the one question their CFO is about to ask: “Can you prove this AI spend is changing outcomes, not just activity?”

Every December, roadmaps get locked, budgets get approved, and board decks are polished until everything looks precise and under control. Underneath, many CTOs and VPs are still working with partial visibility. They have a feel for their teams, but not a reliable view of how work moves through the system, how AI is really changing delivery, or where time and money actually go.

For a while, that was survivable. Experience, pattern recognition, and cheap capital covered the gaps. You could hire around bottlenecks, overstaff critical teams, or quietly pivot away from the messiest parts of the system. Then AI showed up and became the perfect distraction. Pilots, PoCs, Copilot seats, and “AI initiatives” created visible activity and bought time.

In 2026, that grace period ends. Boards and CFOs are shifting from “show me you are experimenting” to “show me measurable impact, this year.” Not because they stopped believing in AI, but because the market no longer rewards vague promises. Every AI dollar will need a traceable path to productivity, quality, or customer value.

If you run engineering, you probably recognise this scene. You present a slide with AI highlights. Adoption is up. Developers say they like the tools. You share a few anecdotes about faster coding and smoother reviews. Then the CFO asks a simple question: “Exactly how is this budget changing output and outcomes?”

TNW City Coworking space - Where your best work happens

A workspace designed for growth, collaboration, and endless networking opportunities in the heart of tech.

What is almost always missing is a clear breakdown of:

So the conversation slips back to learning curves, compounding benefits, and talent attraction. All true, but too soft for a tough budget review. That will not be enough.

AI vendors love task-level numbers. A coding task completed 55 percent faster looks impressive on a slide. But once you zoom out to teams and systems, the picture changes.

Large datasets across thousands of developers show a consistent pattern:

The problem is not the tools. It is the lack of a system for where the “extra” capacity goes.

Most organisations still frame AI productivity in terms of speed: more story points, more tickets, higher deployment frequency. That misses the bigger question:

How much of our engineering capacity goes to net new value versus maintenance, incidents, and rework, and is AI improving that mix?

High-level benchmarks are blunt but helpful. On average, about 45 percent of developer time is spent on maintenance, minor enhancements, and bug fixes rather than on genuinely new, customer-facing work. If AI helps you produce more code inside an unchanged system, you risk:

That is how you end up with impressive local metrics and a leadership team that still feels like engineering is slowing down.

If you want to walk into a 2026 budget conversation with objective evidence, you need to be deliberate about how AI-driven time savings are used. Two moves matter.

AI is already good at boilerplate, tests, documentation, and simple refactors. The trap is treating the saved time as unstructured “extra” capacity that disappears into the noise. Instead:

When teams systematically reduce technical debt and improve tests around critical flows, they cut future incidents and rework. Over a year, that frees more capacity for new work than shaving a few minutes off each ticket ever will.

2. Point AI at the ugly, high-friction work that commonly blows up roadmaps

The biggest productivity wins are not in everyday code generation. They are in:

These activities steal weeks or months of capacity and stall strategic initiatives. Using AI to understand legacy code faster, propose refactoring plans, generate migration scaffolding, and highlight recurring failure patterns can dramatically compress timelines for this work.

In parallel, there is real leverage upstream in the problem space. Teams that reach higher levels of AI adoption report better gains when they:

That reduces wasted builds and focuses effort on changes customers actually care about. The most significant gains do not come from replacing human creativity, but from amplifying it and aiming it at better-defined problems.

DORA metrics are not the enemy. Deployment frequency, lead time, MTTR, and change failure rate remain among the best signals we have for delivery performance. The risk is mistaking them for the whole picture.

Leading organisations are already expanding their scorecard to include:

In 2026, the question in the boardroom will shift from “Are we elite on DORA?” to “How much of our capacity is going into things customers notice, and is AI improving that mix or not?” To answer that cleanly, DORA is necessary but not sufficient. You need a way to connect AI usage, workflow, quality, and business outcomes across the system.

This is where engineering intelligence platforms move from a nice-to-have to mandatory. The organisations that win in 2026 will not do it with one more AI tool or one more disconnected dashboard. They will do it by pulling together data they already have but rarely use in one coherent view:

From there, leaders can answer the questions that actually matter:

Instead of defending AI spend with anecdotes, you walk in with:

That is the difference between “we believe in AI” and “here is how AI changed our delivery engine in measurable ways.”

To be ready for the more complex questions coming next year, use this planning cycle to do four things.

Do this, and you will not just have “AI activity” to show in 2026. You will have a credible, data-backed story from AI spend to business outcomes.

The leaders who thrive next year will not be the ones with the flashiest AI demos or the loudest “AI strategy” slide. They will be the ones who:

Engineering intelligence platforms is a key part of that shift. They give you the complex data to show where time and money go, how AI is really changing delivery, and whether your current pace is sustainable. The shift to data-backed engineering leadership is happening either way.

The gap in 2026 will be between teams still guessing and teams that can prove, in detail, how their engineering organisation works.

            <div id="article-text">Not long ago, like many of you, I read what I feared might be The Next Web’s final article. In late September, TNW’s co-founder announced that the tech conference and news site would be winding down, no more events, no new stories. It felt like the end of an era; the news hit hard!

Yet, just a few weeks ago, a twist arrived: the tech platform Tekpon acquired 100% of TNW’s media and events brand from the Financial Times, ensuring that this nearly two-decade legacy will continue to thrive.

While, myself, trying to read people’s opinions on this topic, I read this comment in one article, from one former TNW editor-in-chief that said: “The Next Web shaped my career, my life… it’s very sad to see it die”.

TNW City Coworking space - Where your best work happens

A workspace designed for growth, collaboration, and endless networking opportunities in the heart of tech.

I asked myself: Why do we always assume that just because one chapter ends, the whole story is over? Yes, taking over TNW is a heavy inheritance, especially with all eyes on us and expectations sky-high.

And I’ll admit, doubts crept in: Am I too small for this? Could someone more experienced do it better? Probably. But here I am, stepping up regardless. Because this isn’t just another blog or brand; TNW is a living ecosystem, a vital community. Its story deserves to continue, and I’m determined to help write the next chapter.

I also know some of you might be wondering: Who is she? What does she know? How many articles has she written? What recommends her?

Before reading all sorts of titles and, let me briefly introduce myself.

I’ve been writing since high school, with thousands of articles under my belt; covering everything from culture, art, and hip hop to design, politics, history, and food. I landed my first content writer job at 18, and alongside writing I pursued another passion: becoming a chef.

(Fun fact: I even made it to the semifinals of MasterChef, a journey that taught me about creativity under pressure and staying cool when the heat is on.)

Now, I channel my storytelling skills into helping businesses better understand technology and use it to their advantage. I help companies tell their stories, the real ones, finding meaning and flow in every word.

Over the years, I’ve specialized in blending creative storytelling with the technical precision of a chef’s knife. (My colleagues at Tekpon might say I can be as sharp as that knife – true to my values and quick to cut through the nonsense.) I am also the “No, we have to do it right” person in the team.

I’ve reviewed countless software products, interviewed founders, and explored how digital innovation can be a force for good in society. Or not. In other words, I’ve always cared about the why behind the tech, the real impact on people’s lives, not just the buzz. That perspective will be behind every story we will publish at TNW.

If there’s a place for those who still think stories written by humans matter, tell me where it is. I’m already on my way.

I’m not here to change TNW’s DNA; I’m here to reinforce it with fresh energy and a clear vision for the future.

To the loyal TNW readers, to the startup founders who looked to us for inspiration, to the healthy tech skeptics who counted on us for a reality check, and to our global audience spread across continents: we hear you.

We all know the world of tech news has changed dramatically. Today, everyone has a megaphone, social media overflows with hot takes, and AI algorithms can crank out content in seconds. It’s easy to feel overwhelmed by this sea of opinions and auto-generated articles. In such a world, the role of a publication like TNW is more critical than ever: to be a filter, not just another firehose of content.

We will focus on curation and clarity, distilling the noise so you don’t have to.

Here’s the good news: despite the deluge of AI-written text out there, readers are actively looking for authentic, human journalism. Every article we will publish will be created by a human writer who is accountable for the facts and who brings context, analysis, and yes, a bit of personality too.

Our mission isn’t to chase every trending headline algorithmically; it’s to help you understand which innovations actually matter, and why.

If a story is everywhere but lacks substance, we won’t regurgitate it; we’ll analyze it or debunk it. If a breakthrough is genuinely promising, we’ll explain why it’s important and how it impacts real people. Being a thoughtful filter in this age of information overload (and AI-generated noise) isn’t just a catchy slogan for us; it’s a responsibility we embrace.

You’ll also notice something different in our approach: an emphasis on storytelling and the human side of tech. Technology doesn’t exist in a vacuum; it’s built and used by people with dreams, dilemmas, and diverse backgrounds.

I believe, and I suspect many of you do too, that the best tech journalism zooms out from the gadgets and code to highlight those human stories. Practically speaking, expect to see more features, interviews, and narrative-driven pieces on TNW.

We’ll talk to founders about the messy, human journey of building a startup, not just the press releases or funding announcements. We’ll spotlight the engineers, designers, and thinkers who are trying to solve big problems (or even small ones that make a big difference). We’ll explore tech’s impact on society: the good, the bad, and the complicated.

This won’t be a place for recycled press releases or surface-level takes. It will be a place for conversation and insight.

Importantly, none of this focus on storytelling means we’ll skimp on rigor. Being engaging doesn’t mean sacrificing accuracy or depth. My team will continue to prioritize thorough research and fact-checking, those good old-school journalism values, even as we experiment with new formats and new voices. In short, we won’t publish anything we wouldn’t want to read ourselves.

Today, looking forward means acknowledging that how we cover tech is as important as what we cover. It means committing to journalism that cuts through the clutter, to storytelling that puts people first, and to a vision of tech’s future that is both hopeful and honest. That’s my vision for TNW as I step into this role, and I hope it resonates with you.

Now, I’d like to turn it over to you, our community. This is your TNW as much as it is ours. I invite you to join the conversation. Tell us what you want to see more of (or less of). Hold us accountable,if we ever fall short, let us know. Share your stories and perspectives with us, because they can inspire our coverage.

In the coming weeks, you’ll start to see this vision take shape on the site. You’ll see familiar faces and new voices. You’ll find articles that make you think, others that make you smile, and hopefully quite a few that make you proud to be a TNW reader.

Whether you’re a long-time follower who’s stuck with us through thick and thin, a startup founder looking for insight, a skeptic keeping us honest, or a curious mind tuning in from anywhere in the world – thank you. We do this for you, and we couldn’t do it without you.

The Next Web is back. We’re here to inform you, inspire you, challenge you, and occasionally even surprise you. I’m honored to have you with us on this journey. Here’s to the road ahead, to storytelling, to journalism (the real kind), and to making sense of the future together.

Thank you for reading, and welcome to TNW’s next chapter. Let’s build it, day by day, story by story, together.
