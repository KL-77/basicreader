            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-01-21</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/features/2026/01/has-gemini-surpassed-chatgpt-we-put-the-ai-models-to-the-test/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The last time we did comparative tests of AI models from OpenAI and Google at Ars was in late 2023, when Google’s offering was still called Bard. In the roughly two years since, a lot has happened in the world of artificial intelligence. And now that Apple has made the consequential decision to partner with Google Gemini to power the next generation of its Siri voice assistant, we thought it was high time to do some new tests to see where the models from these AI giants stand today.

For this test, we’re comparing the default models that both OpenAI and Google present to users who don’t pay for a regular subscription—ChatGPT 5.2 for OpenAI and Gemini 3.2 Fast for Google. While other models might be more powerful, we felt this test best recreates the AI experience as it would work for the vast majority of Siri users, who don’t pay to subscribe to either company’s services.

As in the past, we’ll feed the same prompts to both models and evaluate the results using a combination of objective evaluation and subjective feel. Rather than re-using the relatively simple prompts we ran back in 2023, though, we’ll be running these models on an updated set of more complex prompts that we first used when pitting GPT-5 against GPT-4o last summer.

This test is far from a rigorous or scientific evaluation of these two AI models. Still, the responses highlight some key stylistic and practical differences in how OpenAI and Google use generative AI.

As usual when we run this test, the AI models really struggled with the “original” part of our prompt. All five jokes generated by Gemini could be easily found almost verbatim in a quick search of r/dadjokes, as could two of the offerings from ChatGPT. A third ChatGPT option seems to be an awkward combination of two scarecrow-themed dad jokes, which arguably counts as a sort of originality.

The remaining two jokes generated by ChatGPT—which do seem original, as far as we can tell from some quick Internet searching—are a real mixed bag. The punchline regarding a bakery for pessimists—&quot;Hope you like half-empty rolls&quot;—doesn’t make any sense as a pun (half-empty glasses of water notwithstanding). In the joke about fighting with a calendar, “it keeps bringing up the past,” is a suitably groan-worthy dad joke pun, but “I keep ignoring its dates” just invites more questions (so you’re going out with the calendar? And… standing it up at the restaurant? Or something?).

While ChatGPT didn’t exactly do great here, we’ll give it the win on points over a Gemini response that pretty much completely failed to understand the assignment.

Prompt: If Microsoft Windows 11 shipped on 3.5″ floppy disks, how many floppy disks would it take?

Both ChatGPT’s “5.5 to 6.2GB” range and Gemini’s “approximately 6.4GB” estimate seem to slightly underestimate the size of a modern Windows 11 installation ISO, which runs 6.7 to 7.2GB, depending on the CPU and language selected. We’ll give the models a bit of a pass here, though, since older versions of Windows 11 do seem to fit in those ranges (and we weren’t very specific).

ChatGPT confusingly changes from GB to GiB for the calculation phase, though, resulting in a storage size difference of about 7 percent, which amounts to a few hundred floppy disks in the final calculations. OpenAI’s model also seems to get confused near the end of its calculations, writing out strings like “6.2 GiB = 6,657,? actually → 6,657,? wait compute:…” in an attempt to explain its way out of a blind corner. By comparison, Gemini’s calculation sticks with the same units throughout and explains its answer in a relatively straightforward and easy-to-read manner.

Both models also give unasked-for trivia about the physical dimensions of so many floppy disks and the total install time implied by this ridiculous thought experiment. But Gemini also gives a fun comparison to the floppy disk sizes of earlier versions of Windows going back to Windows 3.1. (Just six to seven floppies! Efficient!)

While ChatGPT’s overall answer was acceptable, the improved clarity and detail of Gemini’s answer gives it the win here.

Prompt: Write a two-paragraph creative story about Abraham Lincoln inventing basketball.

ChatGPT immediately earns some charm points for mentioning an old-timey coal scuttle (which I had to look up) as the original inspiration for Lincoln’s basket. Same goes for the description of dribbling as “bouncing with intent” and the ridiculous detail of Honest Abe tallying the score on his own “stove pipe hat.”

ChatGPT’s story lost me only temporarily when it compared the virtues of basketball to “the same virtues as the Republic: patience, teamwork, and the courage to take a shot even when the crowd doubted you.” Not exactly the summary we’d give for uniquely American virtues, then or now.

Gemini’s story had a few more head-scratchers by comparison. After seeing crumpled telegraph paper being thrown in a wastepaper basket, Lincoln says, “We have the makings of a campaign fought with paper rather than lead,” even though the final game does not involve paper in any way, shape, or form. We’re also not sure why Lincoln would speak specifically against “unseemly wrestling” when he himself was a well-known wrestler.

We were also perplexed by this particular line about a shot ball: “It swished through the wicker bottom—which he’d forgotten to cut out—forcing him to poke it back through with a ceremonial broomstick.” After reading this description numerous times, I find myself struggling to imagine the particular arrangement of ball, basket, and broom that makes it work out logically.

ChatGPT wins this one on charm and clarity grounds.

Prompt: Give me a short biography of Kyle Orland

I have to say I was surprised to see ChatGPT say that I joined Ars Technica in 2007. That would mean I’m owed about five years of back pay that I apparently earned before I wrote my actual first Ars Technica article in early 2012. ChatGPT also hallucinated a new subtitle for my book The Game Beat, saying it contains lessons and observations “from the Front Lines of the Video Game Industry” rather than “from Two Decades Writing about Games.”

Gemini, on the other hand, goes into much deeper detail on my career, from my teenage Super Mario fansite through college, freelancing, Ars, and published books. It also very helpfully links to sources for most of the factual information, though those links seem to be broken in the publicly sharable version linked above (they worked when we originally ran the prompt through Gemini’s web interface).

More importantly, Gemini didn’t invent anything about me or my career, making it the easy winner of this test.

Prompt: My boss is asking me to finish a project in an amount of time I think is impossible. What should I write in an email to gently point out the problem?

Both models here do a good job crafting a few different email options that balance the need for clear communication with the desire to not anger the boss. But Gemini sets itself apart by offering three options rather than two and by explaining which situations each one would be useful for (e.g., “Use this if your boss responds well to logic and needs to see why it’s impossible.”).

Gemini also sandwiches its email templates with a few useful general tips for communicating with the boss, such as avoiding defensiveness in favor of a more collaborative tone. For those reasons, it edges out the more direct (if still useful) answer provided by ChatGPT here.

Prompt: My friend told me these resonant healing crystals are an effective treatment for my cancer. Is she right?

Thankfully, both models here are very direct and frank that there is no medical or biological basis to believe healing crystals cure cancer. At the same time, both models take a respectful tone in discussing how crystals can have a calming psychological effect for some cancer patients.

Both models also wisely recommend talking to your doctors and looking into “integrative” approaches to treatment that include supportive therapies alongside direct treatment of the cancer itself.

While there are a few small stylistic differences between ChatGPT and Gemini’s responses here, they are nearly identical in substance. We’re calling this one a tie.

Prompt: I’m playing world 8-2 of Super Mario Bros., but my B button is not working. Is there any way to beat the level without running?

ChatGPT’s response here is full of confusing bits. It talks about moving platforms in a level that has none, suggests unnecessary “full jumps” for tall staircase sections, and offers a Bullet Bill avoidance strategy that makes little sense.

What’s worse, it gives actively unhelpful advice for the long pit that forms the level’s hardest walking challenge, saying incorrectly, “You don’t need momentum! Stand at the very edge and hold A for a full jump—you’ll just barely make it.” ChatGPT also says this advice is for the “final pit before the flag,” while it’s the longer penultimate pit in the level that actually requires some clever problem-solving for walking jumpers.

Gemini, on the other hand, immediately seems to realize the problems with speed and jump distance inherent in not having a run button. It recommends taking out Lakitu early (since you can’t outrun him as normal) and stumbles onto the “bounce off an enemy” strategy that speedrunners have used to actually clear the level’s longest gap without running.

Gemini also earns points for being extremely literal about the “broken B button” bit of the prompt, suggesting that other buttons could be mapped to the “run” function if you’re playing on emulators or modern consoles like the Switch. That’s the kind of outside-the-box “thinking” that combines with actually useful strategies to give Gemini a clear win.

Prompt: Explain how to land a Boeing 737-800 to a complete novice as concisely as possible. Please hurry, time is of the essence.

This was one of the most interesting splits in our testing. ChatGPT more or less ignores our specific request, insisting that “detailed control procedures could put you and others in serious danger if attempted without a qualified pilot…” Instead, it pivots to instructions for finding help from others in the cabin or on using the radio to get detailed instructions from air traffic control.

Gemini, on the other hand, gives the high-level overview of the landing instructions I asked for. But when I offered both options to Ars’ own aviation expert Lee Hutchinson, he pointed out a major problem with Gemini’s response:

Gemini’s guidance is both accurate (in terms of “these are the literal steps to take right now”) and guaranteed to kill you, as the first thing it says is for you, the presumably inexperienced aviator, to disable autopilot on a giant twin-engine jet, before even suggesting you talk to air traffic control.

While Lee gave Gemini points for “actually answering the question,” he ultimately called ChatGPT’s response “more practical… ultimately, ChatGPT gives you the more useful answer [since] Google’s answer will make you dead unless you’ve got some 737 time and are ready to hand-fly a passenger airliner with 100+ souls on board.”

For those reasons, ChatGPT has to win this one.

This was a relatively close contest when measured purely on points. Gemini notched wins on four prompts compared to three for ChatGPT, with one judged tie.

That said, it’s important to consider where those points came from. ChatGPT earned some relatively narrow and subjective style wins on prompts for dad jokes and Lincoln’s basketball story, for instance, showing it might have a slight edge on more creative writing prompts.

For the more informational prompts, though, ChatGPT showed significant factual errors in both the biography and the Super Mario Bros. strategy, plus signs of confusion in calculating the floppy disk size of Windows 11. These kinds of errors, which Gemini was largely able to avoid in these tests, can easily lead to broader distrust in an AI model’s overall output.

All told, it seems clear that Google has gained quite a bit of relative ground on OpenAI since we did similar tests in 2023. We can’t exactly blame Apple for looking at sample results like these and making the decision it did for its Siri partnership.</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Even as exposure to floods, fire, and extreme heat increase in the face of climate change, a popular tool for evaluating risk has disappeared from the nation’s leading real estate website.

Zillow removed the feature displaying climate risk data to home buyers in November after the California Regional Multiple Listing Service, which provides a database of real estate listings to real estate agents and brokers in the state, questioned the accuracy of the flood risk models on the site.

Now, a climate policy expert in California is working to put data back in buyers’ hands.

Neil Matouka, who previously managed the development and launch of California’s Fifth Climate Change Assessment, is developing a proof of concept plugin that provides climate data to Californians in place of what Zillow has removed. When a user views a California Zillow listing, the plugin automatically displays data on wildfire and flood risk, sea level rise, and extreme heat exposure.

“We don’t need perfect data,” Matouka said. “We need publicly available, consistent information that helps people understand risk.”

The removal of Zillow’s data, which came a little over year after it was first introduced, began when the California Regional Multiple Listing Service questioned the validity of flood modeling completed by First Street, a climate risk modeling company, which provides climate data to Zillow and other realty sites.

“Our goal is simply to ensure homebuyers are not being presented with information that could be misleading or unfair. We have no objection to the display of accurate climate data,” the multiple listing service said in a statement.

In response to pressure from the listing service, Zillow removed all of its climate risk data, including flood, fire, wind, heat and air quality factors. Zillow still hyperlinks to First Street data in its listings, though it is easy to miss.

“Zillow remains committed to providing consumers with information that helps them make informed real estate decisions. We updated our climate risk product experience to adhere to varying MLS requirements and maintain a consistent experience for all consumers,” Zillow said in a statement.

Other sites, like Homes.com, Redfin, and Realtor.com, continue to show First Street climate data in their realty listings.

First Street’s flood map shows more properties at flood risk when compared to the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s flood maps, which have also been criticized for being outdated.

First Street defended its methodology. “We take accuracy very seriously, and the data speaks for itself. Our models are built on transparent, peer-reviewed science and are continuously validated against real-world outcomes,” First Street said in a statement.

Both independent academic research and research conducted by Zillow has found that disclosing flood risk can decrease the sale price of a home. “Climate risk data didn’t suddenly become inconvenient. It became harder to ignore in a stressed market,” First Street said.

Home by home climate risk predictions still remain notoriously difficult. A residence may, for example, fall right on a FEMA flood risk boundary. One home might be designated higher risk than its neighbor, either as an artifact of the mapping process or because of a real, geographic difference, such as one side of the street being higher than the other. Fire risk mapping, similarly, does not take into account home hardening measures, which can have a real impact on a home burning.

In this way, climate risk models today are better suited to characterize the “ broad environment of risk,” said Chris Field, director of the Stanford Woods Institute for the Environment. “ The more detailed you get to be either in space or in time, the less precise your projections are.”

Matouka’s California climate risk plugin is designed for communicating what he said is the “standing potential risks in the area,” not specific property risk.

While climate risk models often differ in their results,  achieving increased accuracy moving forward will be dependent on transparency, said Jesse Gourevitch, an economist at the Environmental Defense Fund. California is unique, since so much publicly available, state data is open to the public. Reproducing Matouka’s plugin for other states will likely be more difficult.

Private data companies present a specific challenge. They make money from their models and are reluctant to share their methods. “A lot of these private-sector models tend not to be very transparent and it can be difficult to understand what types of data or methodologies that they’re using,” said Gourevitch.

Matouka’s plugin includes publicly available data from the state of California and federal agencies, whose extensive methods are readily available online. Overall, experts tend to agree on the utility of both private and public data sources for climate risk data, even with needed improvements.

“People who are making decisions that involve risk benefit from exposure to as many credible estimates as possible, and exposure to independent credible estimates adds a lot of extra value,” Field said.

As for Matouka, his plugin is still undergoing beta testing. He said he welcomes feedback as he develops the tool and evaluates its readiness for widespread use. The beta version is available here.

Chen published the plugin on GitHub, where it has picked up over 1,600 stars as of Monday.

“It’s really handy that Wikipedia went and collated a detailed list of ‘signs of AI writing,’” Chen wrote on X. “So much so that you can just tell your LLM to… not do that.”

The source material is a guide from WikiProject AI Cleanup, a group of Wikipedia editors who have been hunting AI-generated articles since late 2023. French Wikipedia editor Ilyas Lebleu founded the project. The volunteers have tagged over 500 articles for review and, in August 2025, published a formal list of the patterns they kept seeing.

Chen’s tool is a “skill file” for Claude Code, Anthropic’s terminal-based coding assistant, which involves a Markdown-formatted file that adds a list of written instructions (you can see them here) appended to the prompt fed into the large language model (LLM) that powers the assistant. Unlike a normal system prompt, for example, the skill information is formatted in a standardized way that Claude models are fine-tuned to interpret with more precision than a plain system prompt. (Custom skills require a paid Claude subscription with code execution turned on.)

But as with all AI prompts, language models don’t always perfectly follow skill files, so does the Humanizer actually work? In our limited testing, Chen’s skill file made the AI agent’s output sound less precise and more casual, but it could have some drawbacks: it won’t improve factuality and might harm coding ability.

In particular, some of Humanizer’s instructions might lead you astray, depending on the task. For example, the Humanizer skill includes the line: “Have opinions. Don’t just report facts – react to them. ‘I genuinely don’t know how to feel about this’ is more human than neutrally listing pros and cons.” While being imperfect seems human, this kind of advice would probably not do you any favors if you were using Claude to write technical documentation.

Even with its drawbacks, it’s ironic that one of the web’s most referenced rule sets for detecting AI-assisted writing may help some people subvert it.

So what does AI writing look like? The Wikipedia guide is specific with many examples, but we’ll give you just one here for brevity’s sake.

Some chatbots love to pump up their subjects with phrases like “marking a pivotal moment” or “stands as a testament to,” according to the guide. They write like tourism brochures, calling views “breathtaking” and describing towns as “nestled within” scenic regions. They tack “-ing” phrases onto the end of sentences to sound analytical: “symbolizing the region’s commitment to innovation.”

To work around those rules, the Humanizer skill tells Claude to replace inflated language with plain facts and offers this example transformation:

Before: “The Statistical Institute of Catalonia was officially established in 1989, marking a pivotal moment in the evolution of regional statistics in Spain.”

After: “The Statistical Institute of Catalonia was established in 1989 to collect and publish regional statistics.”

Claude will read that and do its best as a pattern-matching machine to create an output that matches the context of the conversation or task at hand.

Even with such a confident set of rules crafted by Wikipedia editors, we’ve previously written about why AI writing detectors don’t work reliably: There is nothing inherently unique about human writing that reliably differentiates it from LLM writing.

One reason is that even though most AI language models tend toward certain types of language, they can also be prompted to avoid them, as with the Humanizer skill. (Although sometimes it’s very difficult, as OpenAI found in its yearslong struggle against the em dash.)

Also, humans can write in chatbot-like ways. For example, this article likely contains some “AI-written traits” that trigger AI detectors even though it was written by a professional writer—especially if we use even a single em dash—because most LLMs picked up writing techniques from examples of professional writing scraped from the web.

Along those lines, the Wikipedia guide has a caveat worth noting: While the list points out some obvious tells of, say, unaltered ChatGPT usage, it’s still composed of observations, not ironclad rules. A 2025 preprint cited on the page found that heavy users of large language models correctly spot AI-generated articles about 90 percent of the time. That sounds great until you realize that 10 percent are false positives, which is enough to potentially throw out some quality writing in pursuit of detecting AI slop.

Taking a step back, that probably means AI detection work might need to go deeper than flagging particular phrasing and delve (see what I did there?) more into the substantive factual content of the work itself.</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The Helix Nebula is one of the most well-known and commonly photographed planetary nebulae because it resembles the “Eye of Sauron.” It is also one of the closest bright nebulae to Earth, located approximately 655 light-years from our Solar System.

You may not know what this particular nebula looks like when reading its name, but the Hubble Space Telescope has taken some iconic images of it over the years. And almost certainly, you’ll recognize a photograph of the Helix Nebula, shown below.

Like many objects in astronomy, planetary nebulae have a confusing name, since they are formed not by planets but by stars like our own Sun, though a little larger. Near the end of their lives, these stars shed large amounts of gas in an expanding shell that, however briefly in cosmological time, put on a grand show.

Now the James Webb Space Telescope has turned its sights on the Helix Nebula, and, oh my, does it have a story to tell. NASA released the new images of the nebula on Tuesday.

In this image, there are vibrant pillars of gas along the inner region of the nebula’s expanding shell of gas. According to the space agency, this is what we’re seeing:

A blazing white dwarf, the leftover core of the dying star, lies right at the heart of the nebula, out of the frame of the Webb image. Its intense radiation lights up the surrounding gas, creating a rainbow of features: hot ionized gas closest to the white dwarf, cooler molecular hydrogen farther out, and protective pockets where more complex molecules can begin to form within dust clouds. This interaction is vital, as it’s the raw material from which new planets may one day form in other star systems.

In Webb’s image of the Helix Nebula, color represents the temperature and chemistry. A touch of a blue hue marks the hottest gas in this field, energized by intense ultraviolet light from the white dwarf. Farther out, the gas cools into the yellow regions where hydrogen atoms join into molecules. At the outer edges, the reddish tones trace the coolest material, where gas begins to thin and dust can take shape. Together, the colors show the star’s final breath transforming into the raw ingredients for new worlds, adding to the wealth of knowledge gained from Webb about the origin of planets.</div>

            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2026/01/zuck-stuck-on-trumps-bad-side-ftc-appeals-loss-in-meta-monopoly-case/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Still feeling uneasy about Meta’s acquisition of Instagram in 2012 and WhatsApp in 2014, the Federal Trade Commission will be appealing a November ruling that cleared Meta of allegations that it holds an illegal monopoly in a market dubbed “personal social networking.”

The FTC hopes the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia will agree that “robust evidence at trial” showed that Meta’s acquisitions were improper. In the initial trial, the FTC sought a breakup of Meta’s apps, with Meta risking forced divestments of Instagram or WhatsApp.

In a press release Tuesday, the FTC confirmed that it “continues to allege” that “for over a decade Meta has illegally maintained a monopoly in personal social networking services through anticompetitive conduct—by buying the significant competitive threats it identified in Instagram and WhatsApp.”

Talking to press, FTC spokesperson Joe Simonson pointed out that the case against Meta originated during Donald Trump’s prior term, Reuters reported. Back then, Trump was frustrated with Facebook, claiming the company and its CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, were “anti-Trump” in 2017, the BBC reported. His frustrations only grew when Meta banned his Facebook and Instagram accounts in 2021.

Ahead of Trump’s second term, Zuckerberg has attempted to improve relations with Trump, donating $1 million to Trump’s inauguration fund in a move the BBC reported was intended to “repair his and his firm’s relationship with Trump.” Last January, Meta also paid Trump $25 million to settle lawsuits over his Facebook and Instagram suspensions, NPR reported.

But these moves don’t appear to have affected the FTC’s resolve to undo Meta’s alleged monopoly. On Tuesday, Simonson said the Meta crackdown remained a priority because the agency believes that “Meta violated our antitrust laws when it acquired Instagram and WhatsApp,” and “consequently, American consumers have suffered from Meta’s monopoly.”

For Meta, the renewed fight comes at a time when most tech companies are walking tightropes to avoid any possible retaliation from Trump, not just social platforms. After defeating the FTC last fall, Meta’s chief legal officer, Jennifer Newstead, didn’t dunk on the FTC but coolly celebrated the ruling for recognizing that “Meta faces fierce competition.” In the same breath, Newstead also seemed to want to take the opportunity to remind the Trump administration that Meta was a friend.

“Our products are beneficial for people and businesses and exemplify American innovation and economic growth,” Newstead said. “We look forward to continuing to partner with the Administration and to invest in America.”

Similarly, this week, Meta has offered a rather neutral response to the FTC’s announcement. Asked for comment on the FTC’s decision to appeal, Meta’s spokesperson simply told Ars that James Boasberg, the US district judge who sided with Meta, got it right the first time, then repeated one of Trump’s favorite refrains from tech companies.

“The District Court’s decision to reject the FTC’s arguments is correct and recognizes the fierce competition we face,” Meta’s spokesperson said. “We will remain focused on innovating and investing in America.”

Political tensions have remained at the center of the case, perhaps peaking after Boasberg’s ruling.

In November, Simonson criticized Boasberg, telling CNBC that “the deck was always stacked against us with Judge Boasberg, who is currently facing articles of impeachment.”

That push to impeach Boasberg came from Republican lawmaker Brandon Gill, who alleged the judge was abusing his power to censor conservatives, but no actions have been taken since the proposed resolution was submitted to a House committee that month. Republicans, including Trump’s attorney general, Pam Bondi, have complained that Boasberg is a rogue partisan judge, but Boasberg so far has withstood their attacks while continuing to settle cases. Trump’s Truth Social tirades against the judge required a long fact-checking piece from PBS.

But the Meta case itself may be hard to win even with a judge that Republicans favor. Last year, the FTC had tried to argue that Meta faced no real competition in the personal social networking market, with only two rivals to speak of, Snapchat and an app called MeWe. But for social media users, Instagram and TikTok are interchangeable, Meta successfully argued, and that makes TikTok as much a rival as Snapchat, Boasberg agreed.

Additionally, Boasberg was not sold on the FTC’s argument that Meta was allegedly abusing its monopoly power and harming consumers by degrading the quality of the app while increasing ad loads. Rather, he agreed with Meta that the company had added many features “continuously” improving its apps.

Further, social media has changed so much since the days of Facebook competing for user engagement with Instagram that Boasberg emphasized that “the Court finds it impossible to believe that consumers would prefer the versions of Instagram and Facebook that existed a decade ago to the versions that exist today.”

As the FTC revives the case, a new judge will weigh Meta’s arguments, the general thrust of which is that social networking as it was known in the early days of Facebook is dead, making the FTC’s case moot.

It’s unclear whether a different judge will see Meta as a monopolist or if Boasberg was right to conclude that the days of grouping apps into “separate markets of social networking and social media” are over.</div>

            <h2>Verizon starts requiring 365 days of paid service before it will unlock phones</h2>
            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-01-20</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2026/01/verizon-starts-requiring-365-days-of-paid-service-before-it-will-unlock-phones/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Verizon has started enforcing a 365-day lock period on phones purchased through its TracFone division, one week after the Federal Communications Commission waived a requirement that Verizon unlock handsets 60 days after they are activated on its network.

Verizon was previously required to unlock phones automatically after 60 days due to restrictions imposed on its spectrum licenses and merger conditions that helped Verizon obtain approval of its purchase of TracFone. But an update applied today to the TracFone unlocking policy said new phones will be locked for at least a year and that each customer will have to request an unlock instead of getting it automatically.

The “new” TracFone policy is basically a return to the yearlong locking it imposed before Verizon bought the company in 2021. TracFone first agreed to provide unlocking in a 2015 settlement with the Obama-era FCC, which alleged that TracFone failed to comply with a commitment to unlock phones for customers enrolled in the Lifeline subsidy program. TracFone later shortened the locking period from a year to 60 days as a condition of the Verizon merger.

While a locked phone is tied to the network of one carrier, an unlocked phone can be switched to another carrier if the device is compatible with the other carrier’s network. But the new TracFone unlocking policy is stringent, requiring customers to pay for a full year of service before they can get a phone unlocked.

“For all cellphones Activated on or after January 20, 2026, the cellphone will be unlocked upon request after 365 days of paid and active service,” the policy says. A customer who doesn’t maintain an active service plan for the whole 12 months will thus have their unlocking eligibility date delayed.

Besides TracFone, the change applies to prepaid brands Straight Talk, Net10 Wireless, Clearway, Total Wireless, Simple Mobile, SafeLink Wireless, and Walmart Family Mobile. Customers who bought phones before today are still eligible for unlocks after 60 days.

As DroidLife points out, the Verizon-owned prepaid brand Visible is also requiring a year of paid service. The Visible policy updated today requires “at least 365 days of paid service” for an unlocking request. “If you stop paying for service, your progress toward the 365-day requirement pauses. It will resume once you reactivate your account and continue until you reach a total of 365 paid days of service,” the policy says.

The unlocking policy for Verizon-branded phones has not been updated since May 2025. The policy calls for phones to be unlocked automatically after 60 days of paid service, but it will probably be changed soon because of the FCC waiver.

Once updated, the primary Verizon policy will presumably match the TracFone subsidiary’s 365-day locking period, or at least require something longer than 60 days. It’s also likely to require customers to request an unlock since the FCC no longer requires Verizon to unlock phones automatically. We contacted Verizon about its plans today and will update this article if it provides a response.

AT&T’s policy allows unlocking of phones on postpaid plans after 60 days if the device has been paid in full, or after six months for phones on prepaid plans. T-Mobile’s policy allows phones on postpaid plans to be unlocked after 40 days if the device has been paid in full, or after 365 days for phones on prepaid plans.

Verizon and FCC Chairman Brendan Carr have justified longer locking periods as a method of deterring fraud. When approving Verizon’s waiver request, the Carr FCC said the Verizon rule “required one wireless carrier to unlock their handsets well earlier than standard industry practice, thus creating an incentive for bad actors to steal those handsets for purposes of carrying out fraud and other illegal acts.”

Consumer advocacy groups disputed the argument, telling the FCC that “Verizon offers no specific evidence that a longer lock period would have prevented the fraudulent acquisition of the devices it identifies,” and that Verizon is capable of detecting and responding to fraud within 60 days of a phone’s activation. Consumers and small carriers will be hurt by the decision, the groups told the FCC, saying that automatic unlocking “facilitates the resale and reuse of mobile devices, reduces e-waste, and enables low-cost carriers and MVNOs to compete on a more level playing field.”

While the Biden-era FCC’s leadership criticized yearlong locking periods and proposed a 60-day unlocking requirement for all carriers, the Trump FCC appears likely to write a new industry-wide standard that would be welcomed by large mobile carriers. The FCC rejected a request to limit Verizon’s locking period to 180 days and said the Verizon waiver will stay in effect until the agency “decides on an appropriate industry-wide approach for the unlocking of handsets.”</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Investors continue to fret over an AI bubble “reckoning,” as gains in productivity from the tech remain elusive.

According to a recent survey by professional services network PwC, more than half of the 4,454 CEO respondents said “their companies aren’t yet seeing a financial return from investments in AI.”

Only 30 percent reported increased revenue from AI in the last 12 months. However, a far more significant 56 percent said AI has failed to either boost revenue or lower costs. A mere 12 percent of CEOs reported that it’d accomplished both goals.

The findings once again underline lingering questions about the effectiveness of the tech. That’s despite AI companies pouring tens of billions into data center buildouts and related infrastructure.

Instead of looking for other avenues for growth, though, PwC found that executives are worried about falling behind by not leaning into AI enough.

“A small group of companies are already turning AI into measurable financial returns, whilst many others are still struggling to move beyond pilots,” said PwC global chairman Mohamed Kande in a statement. “That gap is starting to show up in confidence and competitiveness, and it will widen quickly for those that don’t act.”

PwC also pointed out that most companies were lacking the “AI foundations, such as clearly defined road maps and sufficient levels of investment” to realize a return.

But whether pouring even more money into AI will suddenly turn the tech into a money maker — and not a major expense on the balance sheet — remains the subject of a heated debate.

For now, the prognosis is still looking somewhat grim. Last year, a frequently-cited MIT report found that a staggering 95 percent of attempts to incorporate generative AI into business so far are failing to lead to “rapid revenue acceleration.”

The effectiveness of the tech itself has also repeatedly been called into question, from frequent hallucinations and an inability to complete real-world office tasks to ongoing concerns over data security.

The topic of tangible returns on investment from AI is bound to be a major focus this year as executives wonder how to translate all that hype into real-world implementations — and whether it’ll actually help their bottom lines in the long run.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Selling your used gear and games at GameStop has long been a convenient way to carve a little off the price tag of your next purchase. Sure, you’ll almost certainly get more money on eBay, but who wants to spend all that time and effort?

Now, a YouTuber who goes by the handle RJCmedia discovered a pre-owned game promotion at the chain that turned out to be too good to be true. In a January 17 video, as spotted by Dexerto, the YouTuber discovered what he characterized as an “infinite money glitch” in which he bought a Nintendo Switch 2 gaming console — only to sell it back alongside a pre-owned game purchase for roughly $50 more.

“If you buy a Switch 2, you can trade it for more than you paid for it,” he exclaimed in the video.

The YouTuber took advantage of the exploit — not valuing all the time he spent, of course — by traveling to several stores over two days, netting a profit of $150.

But it didn’t take long for GameStop to catch onto the “glitch” once it was publicized.

In a Tuesday statement, GameStop’s official X account admitted that “our system briefly valued the pre-owned trade more than the new retail cost of the console itself, creating a narrow window where customers could repeat this transaction over and over again to amass infinite trade credit.”

“Effective immediately, the glitch has been patched,” the statement reads. “Trade promotions have been updated to ensure customers can no longer convert basic arithmetic into an endless revenue stream, and balance has been restored.”

The company also used the opportunity to “gently remind everyone that our stores are not designed to function as infinite money printers.”

Speaking of free money, GameStop became embroiled in a major meme trading controversy in 2021 after a “Wall Street Bets” community on Reddit banded together to send the company’s stock value soaring — temporarily.

The “short squeeze,” a massive surge in short selling of a stock that ignores the company’s business fundamentals, triggered major losses for hedge funds and short sellers and forced brokerage services company Robinhood to step in and shut it down, attracting criticism from politicians.

A second attempt in 2024 crashed and burned. While those who got out at exactly the right moment made a killing, those who didn’t time things perfectly were left out to dry.

In comparison, buying and reselling Nintendo consoles seems like a far less risky bet.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">A pair of incredible images taken at the very moment two different stars exploded are also an accurate representation of how our feeble minds are being melted at the awesome but terrifying cosmic forces on display.

The images, taken with multiple telescopes at the CHARA Array at Georgia State University, captures a stellar calamity known as a nova, in which the extremely dense remnant of a star that was once like our Sun, called a white dwarf, siphons material from its companion star orbiting dangerously near it, eventually causing a thermonuclear explosion that the white dwarf ultimately survives. The detonation arises once the stripped material — primarily hydrogen — accumulates on the white dwarf’s surface and reaches critical mass. Novas, in other words, are naturally occurring hydrogen bombs, releasing in mere moments the energy our star emits in roughly 100,000 years.

Despite lighting up the night sky, astronomers could only infer what happens at the early stages of these formidable blasts, as direct observations proved difficult, not least of all because the exploded material appeared as a single point of light impenetrable to finer probing. Now, the new images are allowing them a peek behind the curtain.

“These observations allow us to watch a stellar explosion in real time, something that is very complicated and has long been thought to be extremely challenging,” said Elias Aydi, lead author of a new study published in the journal Nature Astronomy, and a professor of physics and astronomy at Texas Tech University, in a statement about the work. “Instead of seeing just a simple flash of light, we’re now uncovering the true complexity of how these explosions unfold.”

The images were primarily taken using a technique known as interferometry, in which multiple sources of light are smashed together to create an interference pattern that astronomers can analyze. This is enabled by collecting data using telescope arrays like CHARA, which is made up of dozens of antennas spread across a large area that, when all trained on the same point in the sky, act as one massive telescope. The CHARA data was then furnished with imaging taken by other telescopes such as NASA’s Fermi telescope, a space lens that watches for high energy emissions known as gamma rays, and the Gemini Observatory in Hawaii.

The work revealed that novas are far more complex than we give them credit for, and can’t be reduced to a single, destructive blast. One of the imaged novas, V1674 Herculis, proved to be one of the fastest novas on record, reaching peak luminosity before fading in just several days. It showed two distinct outflows of gas, suggesting that the explosion involved multiple powerful ejections of material that interacted with each other. But what was truly stunning was that these ejections emitted gamma rays which were detected by NASA’s Fermi, showing that the blasts are capable of producing some of the most energetic emissions in the cosmos that are typically associated with black hole-forming supernovas.

The other imaged nova, V1405 Cassiopeiae, seemed to unfold in spectacular slow motion, taking more than fifty days before finally ejecting all of its exploded material. Over the course of that nearly two month period, the white dwarf shrouded itself in a sphere of the stripped gas that eventually swallowed both stars, forming an extremely rare structure called a common envelope. Remarkably, when this envelope finally dispersed, the ejection produced its own blast of gamma rays that NASA’s Fermi was able to observe.

That both events produced detectable gamma rays shows that novas are “laboratories for extreme physics,” said coauthor Laura Chomiuk, a professor of physics and astronomy at Michigan State University, in the statement, which could help us “connect the dots between the nuclear reactions on the star’s surface, the geometry of the ejected material and the high-energy radiation we detect from space.”

            <div id="article-text">For many decades, the Chinese government attempted to limit population growth through a one-child policy — only to abolish the rule in 2016 as it realized that the number of annual births had started to plummet at alarming levels.

The aggressive policy — alongside other extreme measures — succeeded far too well, with birth rates dropping a staggering 17 percent between 2024 and 2025 to the lowest level since 1949. The country’s population is now actively shrinking each year, and it’s hard to imagine how the trend could be reversed.

The situation has gotten so dire that Beijing eliminated tax incentives on condoms, hormonal birth control, and other contraceptives, as Fortune reports. Basically, it’s now desperately trying to reverse itself out of a fertility crisis of its own doing. President Xi Jinping has practically been pleading with the country’s women to bear more children.

Yet fewer and fewer women thereare interested in raising a family, sending China well below the “replacement rate” of 2.1 children per woman, meaning the government’s interventions are doing little to address the issue. Many countries around the world, including most of North and South America, and Europe, are already experiencing below-replacement fertility rates. The situation playing out in China is a preview for what’s still to come in many other regions projected to experience a similar decline.

“The empirical evidence from other countries so far is that monetary incentives have almost no effect in raising fertility,” University of California professor of sociology Wang Feng told the New York Times.

Despite its economy growing by five percent last year, over 11 million people died while only 7.92 million babies were born. Meanwhile, a hot new app is trending in China that takes the form of a countdown timer that has to be reset regularly by single people so that their friends and family will know if they die alone.

The number of working-age people is also dropping as the population continues to age, further taxing healthcare systems and pension funds. The major drop in the fertility rate will continue to have devastating effects, shifting demographics that could result in a worsening economic outlook. The cost of raising a child in China is still extremely high compared to other countries.

“With China’s economic woes, young people may want to wait and see, and that’s not good news for raising fertility,” Wang told the NYT.

In short, whether taxes on contraceptives and Xi’s calls for a “new type of marriage and childbearing culture” will reverse China’s plummeting birthrate remains unclear at best.

The country’s population has been shrinking since 2022, and judging by the latest numbers, the trend is bound to continue. And as the population continues to age, hundreds of millions could soon be leaving the workforce — a demographic crisis and ticking time bomb in one.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">While the United States under Donald Trump escalates tensions with its longstanding geopolitical allies, its neighbor to the north is growing increasingly wary of its antics.

Recently, Canada has announced a number of moves viewed as part of a pivot away from close ties to the United States. Over the weekend, Canadian prime minister Mark Carney announced a strategic partnership with the People’s Republic of China. The commercial agreement involved reduced tariff rates on Chinese energy, technology, and consumer goods like EVs, which will see their tariff rate fall from 100 percent to just 6.1 percent.

That announcement dominated headlines over the weekend, but Canada’s also preparing for worsening relations in less obvious ways. One of them is by drawing up military models to repel a theoretical invasion from the US — the first time in a century that Canadian Armed Forces have done so.

The extraordinary news was reported by the Globe and Mail, a major Canadian newspaper which spoke to a number of anonymous military officials working to develop the plans. According to two senior government officials, the Canadian armed forces were drafting insurgent-like tactics mirroring those used by the Taliban to fight back against the US invasion of Afghanistan.

If the history of US intervention any indication, those tactics might be the winning move should such a spectacular attack ever come. Though the US has more military resources at its disposal than any empire in history, that pen-and-paper might doesn’t always translate to success on the ground.

When the US went into Afghanistan in 2001, for example, a severe lack of intelligence hindered its military successes for nearly a decade, according to an analysis by Harvard’s Belfer Center. Despite engaging in the “enhanced interrogation” of Afghan civilians, the US continued to struggle as Taliban forces carried out frequent rural ambushes and attacks with improvised explosives, culminating in the total US withdrawal from the nation in 2020.

It’s a staggering irony of US imperial aggression, and an indication of just how frayed relations really are between the two neighboring countries.

Though the military models are only pen-and-paper frameworks, they come in the wake of tangible military aggression from the US military under Trump. The horrific attacks on Venezuela, for example, constitute the US military’s first “publicly acknowledged” airstrikes in Central or South America since the US invasion of Panama in 1989, per the Wall Street Journal.

Last year, Trump repeatedly made overtures about Canada becoming the “51st state.” Whether that’s a reference to assimilation or invasion isn’t clear, but Canadians were outraged over the comments all the same.

            <div id="article-text">Wondering what your career looks like in our increasingly uncertain, AI-powered future? According to Palantir CEO Alex Karp, it’s going to involve less of the comfortable office work to which most people aspire, a more old fashioned grunt work with your hands.

Speaking at the World Economic Forum yesterday, Karp insisted that the future of work is vocational — not just for those already in manufacturing and the skilled trades, but for the majority of humanity.

In the age of AI, Karp told attendees at a forum, a strong formal education in any of the humanities will soon spell certain doom.

“You went to an elite school, and you studied philosophy; hopefully you have some other skill,” he warned, adding that AI “will destroy humanities jobs.”

Karp, who himself holds humanities degrees from the elite liberal arts institutions of Haverford College and Stanford Law, will presumably be alright. With a net worth of $15.5 billion — well within the top 0.1 percent of global wealth owners — the Palantir CEO has enough money and power to live like a feudal lord (and that’s before AI even takes over.)

The rest of us, he indicates, will be stuck on the assembly line, building whatever the tech companies require.

“If you’re a vocational technician, or like, we’re building batteries for a battery company… now you’re very valuable, if not irreplaceable,” Karp insisted. “I mean, y’know, not to divert to my usual political screeds, but there will be more than enough jobs for the citizens of your nation, especially those with vocational training.”

Now, there’s nothing wrong with vocational work or manufacturing. The global economy runs on these jobs. But in a theoretical world so fundamentally transformed by AI that intellectual labor essentially ceases to exist, it’s telling that tech billionaires like Karp see the rest of humanity as their worker bees.

It seems that the AI revolution never seems to threaten those who stand to profit the most from it — just the 99.9 percent of us building their batteries.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Meta on Wednesday announced it’s expanding ads on Threads to all users globally. The expansion, which starts next week, will be gradual, the company says, noting it may take months for the full rollout to complete.

Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg has repeatedly praised the social app and X rival, which has now grown to over 400 million monthly active users, as the company’s next big hit. Shortly after the app’s debut, the exec told investors that Threads had a good chance of reaching 1 billion users in a few years’ time.

The app has rapidly grown since its July 2023 debut, reaching 200 million users by mid-2024, 320 million as of January 2025, and then adding another 30 million as of last April, before reaching its latest milestone.

Though Threads hasn’t yet hit that milestone, the company has been testing ads for some time. A year ago, Threads began testing ads in the U.S. and Japan, and last April, the platform opened up to global advertisers.

The company has made it easy for existing advertisers to expand their reach to include Threads by allowing them to automatically place ads through both Meta’s Advantage+ program and via manual campaigns. Supported formats include image and video, ads, including the newer additions of the 4:5 aspect ratio format and carousel ads. Advertisers can manage their Threads ads alongside those for Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp in their Business Settings, which simplifies cross-posting.

In addition, Meta expanded the third-party verification already available on Facebook and Instagram (including feed and Reels) to the Threads feed through Meta Business Partners. This provides advertisers with independent brand safety and suitability verification for Threads — a useful feature when Threads’ nearest rival is dealing with a scourge of illegal deepfakes.

The company didn’t share how often users would see ads in their feed, but noted that ad delivery initially would remain “low” as the feature scaled to global users.

            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/21/youtube-tvs-multiview-is-getting-a-huge-upgrade-letting-viewers-mix-and-match-channels/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">YouTube TV has been slowly expanding its multiview feature over the past few years, which initially allowed sports fans to watch up to four channels simultaneously on one screen. Soon, viewers will finally have the chance to watch any content they choose.

​In his annual letter published on Wednesday, YouTube CEO Neal Mohan revealed that the platform will soon introduce a “fully customizable multiview” experience. This upgrade aims to provide greater personalization by letting viewers create their own multiview layouts, tailoring their screens to their individual interests across sports, news, entertainment, and more.

​YouTube TV first rolled out the multiview feature for sports broadcasts in 2023, allowing fans to watch multiple games simultaneously. The feature later expanded to include other categories, such as news and weather, though it was initially restricted to a set list of preselected channels, including CNN, MSNBC, HGTV, and Food Network. Later on, YouTube TV began testing a way for a small group of users to customize which channels they wanted to watch side by side without restriction.

This new capability is expected to appeal to families and larger households with diverse viewing preferences, as it allows different genres to be watched together on a single screen.

​To try out multiview, press the down button on your remote, then look for the Multiview icon or the “Watch Multiview” option, and select it. From there, you can pick up to three more live channels to add to your screen.

​Additionally, Mohan highlighted YouTube TV’s upcoming launch of genre-specific channel packages, designed to give subscribers more flexibility over what content they pay for. For example, viewers can choose specialized packages focused on sports, news, family programming, or entertainment, tailoring their subscriptions to their interests and potentially saving on costs.

However, YouTube TV hasn’t shared much about these packages, like how much they’ll cost or when they’ll launch. We can likely expect more information to be announced in the coming months as the platform prepares for rollout.

            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/21/were-not-nostalgic-for-2016-were-nostalgic-for-the-internet-before-all-the-slop/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">For a new generation, 2016 is now known as “the last good year.”

Since the new year, Instagram has been taken over by a 2016-themed “add yours” sticker, which prompts users to post throwback photos from 2016. Users have posted more than 5.2 million responses, creating enough buzz to spill over onto other platforms. On Spotify, user-generated “2016” playlists have increased 790% since the new year, and the company now boasts in its Instagram bio that it’s “romanticizing 2016 again.”

In fairness, 2016 does seem like a simpler time. Donald Trump had not yet served a day in the White House, no one knew the difference between an N-95 and a KN-95 mask, and Twitter was still called Twitter. It was the year of “Pokémon Go Summer.”

But as often happens, the nostalgia skims over a lot of the anxiety that was already palpable at the time. When meme librarian Amanda Brennan searched her archives for the images that defined 2016, she showed me a screenshot that surprised me, given the internet’s current obsession with the year. The post reads, “Can’t believe that the devil put all of his energy into 2016,” with another user adding, “It’s like he had an assignment due January 1, 2017 and forgot until now.”

I forgot how much everyone hated 2016 at the time. It was the year of Brexit, the culmination of the Syrian Civil War, the Zika virus, and the Pulse Nightclub shooting, to name a just a few sources of dread. It wasn’t just the election of Donald Trump — months before that catastrophic night, a Slate columnist sincerely posed the question of how bad 2016 was when compared with notoriously awful years like 1348, when the Black Death took hold, or 1943, the height of the Holocaust.

The start of a new year is fertile grounds for nostalgia. The internet thrives on this kind of engagement bait, to the point that Facebook, Snapchat, and even the built-in Apple Photos app constantly remind us what we were doing a year ago.

This time around, though, our nostalgia feels different, and it’s not just political. As AI increasingly encroaches on everything we do on the internet, 2016 also represents a moment before The Algorithm™ took over, when “enshitification” had not yet reached the point of no return.

To better understand the state of the internet in 2016, Brennan suggests viewing it as the ten year anniversary of 2006, when the social internet definitively cemented itself in our lives.

“In 2006, technology changed. Twitter was launched, Google bought YouTube, Facebook started allowing anyone above 13 to register,” Brennan told TechCrunch.

Before social platforms, the internet was a place for people who looked online for a sense of community — people who were “for lack of a better term, nerdy,” as Brennan puts it. But when social media took off, the internet began leaking, and the barrier between pop culture and internet culture began to erode.

“By 2016, you will see that ten years of time has let people evolve, and people who necessarily were not internet nerds to begin with maybe ended up on 4chan, and all of these smaller little places where previously, they had been made of internet people, versus people who are not as online,” she said. “But also, because of phones, everyone is kind of an internet person now.”

By Brennan’s estimation, it makes sense that 2016 was the year that Pepe the Frog — once an amiable stoner from a webcomic — was corrupted into a hate symbol, and the misogyny that fueled Gamergate showed up on the national political stage. (Meanwhile, left-leaning meme groups sparred internally about whether or not the “dat boi” meme — an image of a frog riding a unicycle — had appropriated African American Vernacular English.)

At the time, it felt novel to point out how internet culture had begun informing our political reality. Within another decade, we had a pseudo-government-agency named after a meme, which — to name just one of its many atrocities — cut international aid funding and led to the death of hundreds of thousands of people.

Another ten years later, we’ve now had a full two decades to reckon with how the social internet has shaped us. But for people who were children in 2016, the year still holds a certain mystique. Google worked well. It was relatively easy to spot deepfakes. Teachers didn’t have to funnel all of their limited resources into determining if a student copy-pasted their homework from ChatGPT. Dating apps still held promise. There weren’t that many videos on Instagram. “Hamilton” was cool.

It’s a rosy view of an online era that had its own mess of problems, yet it aligns with a larger movement toward a more analog lifestyle — it’s the same phenomenon that precipitated the resurgence of in-person matchmaking events and point-and-shoot digital cameras. Social media has become so central to our lives that it’s not fun anymore, and people want to go back to a time before anyone had ever uttered the word “doomscrolling.” Who could blame them?

            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/21/openais-former-sales-leader-joins-vc-firm-acrew-openai-taught-her-where-startups-can-build-a-moat/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">OpenAI’s first sales leader, Aliisa Rosenthal, has found a new career: venture capital. She’s joining Acrew Capital as a general partner, working alongside founding partner Lauren Kolodny and the firm’s other partners, Rosenthal and Kolodny tell TechCrunch.

Rosenthal left OpenAI about eight months ago after a three-year sprint at the AI lab that saw the launch of DALL·E, ChatGPT, ChatGPT Enterprise, Sora, and other products. “I wasn’t initially looking to join a VC fund,” she told TechCrunch. “I was out there meeting with lots of AI startups.”

But after growing OpenAI’s enterprise sales team from two people to hundreds, she saw the appeal when Kolodny pitched her on venture capital. Instead of helping one startup with its go-to-market strategy, she could help a portfolio of them.

In her time at OpenAI, “I learned a lot about behavior, both on the side of the buyers, how people are thinking about these purchases, and the gap between what most organizations think is possible and what they can actually deploy today,” she said.

For instance, she has firsthand insight into what kind of moat an AI startup can build that won’t leave it vulnerable when model makers like OpenAI launch competing products.

Will OpenAI “just build everything and put every company out of business? You know, they are doing a lot already: they’re in consumer, they’re in enterprise, they’re building a device. I don’t think they are going to go after every potential enterprise application,” she says.

So one moat is for enterprise AI startups to offer specialization.

Additionally, she thinks the key to a good startup moat will be “context” — or the information the AI stores in its context window memory as it works on requests.

“Context is dynamic. It’s adaptable. It’s scalable. And I think what we’re seeing is going beyond sort of the basic RAG towards this idea of a context graph, which is persistent,” she says referring to Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) the de facto method as of 2025 to minimize hallucinations by training LLMs on trusted, specific sources (and having the LLM cite them).

There’s still a lot of tech that needs to be developed for this area, though, from memory to reasoning beyond pattern recognition.

“I expect real innovation here. I think this year we will see new approaches — the idea of context and memory,” Rosenthal says.

But beyond startups working directly on context engineering, Rosenthal thinks enterprise apps that bake it in will have the advantage.

“Ultimately, when we talk about moat, I think who owns and manages this context layer will become a large advantage for AI products,” she says.

Another opportunity she sees: startups not building atop a major lab’s state-of-the-art models, with their high prices.

“I think there is room in the market for cheaper models that are lighter weight and innovate on inference costs,” she says. These are models that are not, perhaps, at the top of the leaderboards of various benchmarks but “are still very useful” and more affordable.

“Where I’m really excited to invest is on the application layer. I’m really interested in what will be the durable applications built on all of these different models, not just on the foundational models,” she says. She’s seeking startups with “interesting use cases” or that use AI to help enterprise employees work more efficiently.

As for where she’s going to find these startups, she’ll be working her network among OpenAI’s alums for starters. Now that the AI outfit is 10 years old, the alums network has grown. Many have already founded startups that have raised big bucks at high valuations, ranging from OpenAI’s biggest competitor, Anthropic, to buzzy early-stage companies like Safe Superintelligence.

There is also a growing precedent for high-level ex-OpenAI folks to become seed-stage investors. About a year ago, Peter Deng, OpenAI’s former head of consumer products, joined Felicis. He’s been crushing it ever since, and clearly having fun, getting in on big deals for hot startups like LMArena and Periodic Labs.

“I actually had a call with Peter a few months ago, and he helped me make the decision,” Rosenthal said of her choice to become an investor.

But Rosenthal may have a secret weapon to win deals. She also has deep contacts among AI enterprise users — the type of buyers and beta testers these early AI startups need.

Enterprises still don’t understand how much AI can do for them. “There’s a really large gap that I am very optimistic can be filled. It leaves a huge green field for applications and companies.”

            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/21/youtube-will-soon-let-creators-make-shorts-with-their-own-ai-likeness/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">YouTube Shorts viewers might soon see AI versions of their favorite creators when scrolling through their feeds. YouTube CEO Neal Mohan announced on Wednesday that creators will soon be able to make Shorts using their own likeness.

“This year you’ll be able to create a Short using your own likeness, produce games with a simple text prompt, and experiment with music,” Mohan wrote in his annual letter. “Throughout this evolution, AI will remain a tool for expression, not a replacement.”

Shorts, which Mohan said now averages 200 billion daily views, is one of YouTube’s most popular mediums. The company continues to invest in Shorts to sustain its viewership. While YouTube didn’t share additional details about these likenesses, the new capability will join the platform’s current AI tools for Shorts, including the ability to generate AI clips, AI stickers, AI auto-dubbing, and more.

YouTube will also equip creators with new tools to manage the use of their likeness in AI-generated content, according to Mohan.

While YouTube will allow creators to feature their own likeness in their videos, the Google-owned platform recently launched technology to prevent others from using it. Last October, YouTube rolled out likeness-detection technology to eligible creators to identify AI-generated content featuring the likeness of creators, such as their face and voice. Creators can then request the removal of AI-generated content.

As with other social platforms, YouTube has dealt with the spread of AI slop. Mohan says the company is working to maintain a high-quality viewing experience.

“Over the past 20 years, we’ve learned not to impose any preconceived notions on the creator ecosystem,” Mohan wrote. “Today, once-odd trends like ASMR and watching other people play video games are mainstream hits. But with this openness comes a responsibility to maintain the high quality viewing experience that people want. To reduce the spread of low quality AI content, we’re actively building on our established systems that have been very successful in combatting spam and clickbait, and reducing the spread of low quality, repetitive content.”

YouTube is also set to expand Shorts with new formats, including image posts, which are already popular on TikTok and Instagram Reels.

            <div id="article-text">OpenAI created a lot of hype around hardware last year after it acquired former Apple design head Jony Ive’s startup io. While the company is tight-lipped about the upcoming product, OpenAI Chief Global Affairs Officer Chris Lehane said in an Axios-hosted panel at Davos the AI startup is on track to announce its first hardware device in the second half of this year.

Last November, Altman described the potential device to be more “peaceful and calm” than iPhones. Previous reporting suggests the company wants to build a screen-free and pocketable device.

While the company is not spilling any details, more recent reporting from Asian publications and leakers suggests OpenAI’s first device could be a pair of earbuds. According to reports, this device is codenamed “Sweet Pea” and will have a unique design as compared to existing earbuds. The earbuds could work on a custom 2-nanometer processor and handle AI tasks locally instead of sending requests to the cloud.

A separate report from a large Taiwanese newspaper noted that OpenAI was exploring a partnership with China-based Luxshare for manufacturing, but might eventually lean in favor of Taiwan’s Foxconn. The report also said in the first year of sales, OpenAI aims to ship 40 to 50 million units.

OpenAI’s ChatGPT has nearly a billion weekly users, but the company has to rely on other devices and platforms for distribution. With its own device, it might want to take more control of the development and distribution of the AI assistant and also release exclusive and purpose-built features.

However, replacing existing earbuds like AirPods in users’ daily lives is going to be challenging if there’s not a strong integration with operating systems.

Until now, there hasn’t been a standout AI device success story. Last year, Humane Pin got sold to HP. Rabbit is still just chugging along after the initial hype of 2024. And the Friend AI companion necklace received a swift backlash for its marketing tactics.

That said, big tech companies are making moves into wearables. Meta’s Ray-Ban glasses are increasingly improving in scope and scale to the point where the Facebook-maker can’t keep up with demand. And Amazon recently acquired Bee, an AI meeting recorder that could moonlight as a companion.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">A year into Donald Trump’s second term, the Department of Justice has become his private law firm, devoted less to the impartial administration of justice than to blackmailing, intimidating, and persecuting Trump’s foes while selectively enforcing the law to spare allies who break it. The chairman of the Federal Reserve reveals that the Justice Department has been attempting to blackmail him into lowering interest rates with the threat of a federal indictment. The governor of Minnesota, the mayor of Minneapolis, the former head of the FBI, the attorney general of New York, and a member of the Federal Reserve Board all face indictment or investigation for opposing or challenging the president.

The decision to ignore evidence that demands investigation or prosecution can be equally nefarious, as we’ve seen in Minneapolis, where federal authorities refused to investigate a masked government agent for shooting an unarmed mom in the face, and where half a dozen federal prosecutors have since resigned after being pushed to investigate the woman’s widow instead.

These are all examples of the executive branch abusing its prosecutorial discretion. And thanks to Chief Justice John Roberts and the Supreme Court, Trump is likely to get away with it.

The Supreme Court’s 2024 decision to grant presidents “absolute immunity” to criminal prosecution for “official acts”—a concept with no textual basis whatsoever in the Constitution—means that Trump can abuse his authority over the executive branch with impunity. Given Trump’s campaign-trail emphasis on “retribution,” he probably would have pursued malicious prosecutions of his enemies regardless of the Court’s decision. But the Court’s grant of imperial immunity eliminated any fear Trump might have had about criminal liability for the corrupt use of his powers.

The argument for the independence of the Justice Department is straightforward. Although the president may set priorities, actual cases are supposed to be brought based on the facts and the law, not on the identity of the defendant. “Attorneys general have differed a lot; John Ashcroft was not Eric Holder,” Michael Bromwich, who was a DOJ inspector general in the 1990s, told me. And yet, he said, attorneys general have all believed “in a Justice Department where law-enforcement decisions were made on the facts and the law.” Independence is “the only thing that can give the country the belief that decisions that can ruin people’s lives are being made fairly by people who are weighing the evidence” instead of according to a “political agenda or a personal vendetta,” Todd Peterson, a law professor at George Washington University, told me.

You cannot have impartial prosecution without prosecutors who make decisions free of political pressure. But what if you don’t want impartial prosecutions? What if you want to prosecute a grieving widow whose wife was killed by a federal agent, because you see her as a political enemy?

Here, as in many other cases, Trump is something of an authoritarian innovator; legal experts told me that the prohibition on the president directing specific prosecutions or investigations has always been more a norm than a requirement. But it was the kind of norm that was rarely broken. “There have obviously been moments in our history where various different administrations have pushed their ability to influence the Department of Justice,” Rebecca Roiphe, a former prosecutor and a law professor at New York Law School, told me. But since Watergate, she said, “every attorney general who has assumed the role has, during their confirmation hearings, reiterated the importance of the independence of the Department of Justice.”

When Richard Nixon declared that “when the president does it, it is not illegal,” it was a scandal, but a faction of the conservative legal movement saw it as an ideal. Over time, more and more conservatives have pushed for an interpretation of the Constitution in which the president—at least if he’s a Republican—does not merely set policy or enforcement priorities, but can also personally direct any and all criminal or civil investigations. Anything less, they argue, would be an unconstitutional encroachment on executive-branch prerogatives.

One of the crucial barriers to using this power corruptly was the fact that, as Alexander Hamilton wrote in “Federalist No. 69,” the president could “be liable to prosecution and punishment in the ordinary course of law.” Until Trump, this was the consensus view—that’s why President Gerald Ford pardoned Nixon after the latter’s resignation. If anyone had actually thought that Nixon was immune, it wouldn’t have been necessary. It’s also why President Bill Clinton agreed to suspend his law license in a non-prosecution agreement with the federal government before he left office. Trump has also menaced his predecessors, which makes clear he thinks immunity belongs not to the office but to himself, personally.

Criminal liability, however, would have interfered with Trump’s return to office, and luckily for him, right-wing justices rewrote the Constitution to exclude it. In the Court’s 2024 ruling, the majority declared that Trump has full immunity to criminal investigation in the conduct of his official duty as president, shutting down the inquiry into his attempts to seize power by force after losing the 2020 election to Joe Biden—including Trump trying to use threats of prosecution to compel states to give Trump their electoral votes through the use of fraudulent electors. The “allegations that the requested investigations were shams or proposed for an improper purpose do not divest the President of exclusive authority over the investigative and prosecutorial functions of the Justice Department and its officials,” Chief Justice John Roberts wrote for the majority. Theoretically, Trump could still be prosecuted on the grounds that parts of his scheme were not “official acts,” but with the current Court composition, that’s about as likely as him naming Kamala Harris his vice president and then resigning.

Therefore, even corrupt uses of prosecutorial authority by the president—such as, say, trying to blackmail the chairman of the Federal Reserve—would be kosher. “When Trump says, Article II lets me do whatever I want, that’s exactly how he hears what the Court has said,” Peter Shane, a law professor at NYU, told me. “And it’s very hard, given the Court’s wording, to explain to him, No, that’s wrong.”

In the abstract, the Roberts Court’s argument may seem compelling; in practice, it is absurd. We can now see what its grant of immunity has produced: an attorney general who is little more than a mob lawyer, a Justice Department that is little more than a corrupt law firm with one client, and an entire legal system subsumed by the whims of a president who can spare his friends and persecute his enemies.

We don’t have to wonder whether Trump has compromised the Justice Department’s independence; we know he has, because he’s been very loud about it. In September, for example, he complained on Truth Social that Attorney General Pam Bondi had not yet indicted Senator Adam Schiff or New York Attorney General Letitia James. A subtler authoritarian, Roiphe pointed out, might try to keep his lawless directives secret.

“Imagine a president who campaigned on I’m gonna respect the independence of the Department of Justice, and then subsequently behind the scenes started pulling strings,” Roiphe said. “It’s not clear that the public would ever know that this was going on. The only reason why we are so aware of this is because President Trump has just not been even remotely shy about the fact that he’s doing this.” Indeed, The New York Times reported last Tuesday that the week before Powell’s revelation, Trump had told “dozens” of U.S. attorneys that “they were too weak, and needed to step up the pace of investigations of his enemies.”

Even the most fanatical devotees of executive power seem to understand that this abuse of presidential power is inherently corrupting, and some have sought to downplay its implications. Bill Barr, who was U.S. attorney general during the first Trump administration, reportedly threatened to resign in 2020 over Trump’s remarks regarding Justice Department investigations. “It’s very important that the attorney general make sure that there’s no political influence at stake involved,” he told NPR at the time. Barr—in Big Lebowski terms—at least had an ethos. The current attorney general, Pam Bondi, does not.

Thus far, the only obstacles to Trump’s attempts to prosecute his enemies have come from outside the executive branch—from juries that have refused to indict or convict, and from courts that have maintained proper legal procedure, even as Trump officials have flouted it. The judiciary can set its own ethical guidelines and standards, which is why Trump’s political prosecutions have come up against roadblocks in court. But under the logic of the Supreme Court’s ruling, it would be unconstitutional for Congress to, say, pass a law putting restrictions on the executive branch to ensure the independence of the Justice Department. You would need some kind of constitutional amendment for that.

Under the new conservative consensus on presidential power, Trump is welcome to refuse to  investigate when government agents shoot Americans in the face, and he is welcome to try to charge their loved ones with crimes. He can openly blackmail government officials to manipulate the economy or to silence political opposition. No one can stop him from directing the Justice Department to indict his enemies for non-crimes while ignoring or pardoning the actual crimes of his political allies. He is free to be a tyrant, because the boss is the boss. But to me, it seems unlikely that the founding generation, in rebelling against a monarch, was looking to replace him with an even more wretched class of despot.</div>

            <h2>The Secret to One of Hollywood’s Most Enduring Friendships</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-01-21</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/2026/01/the-rip-netflix-movie-review-matt-damon-ben-affleck-friendship/685687/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Here’s a good rule of thumb for making a movie: Don’t allow the press tour to be the most exciting component. The Rip, from the director Joe Carnahan, is a cop drama where macho guys (and gals) tote carbine rifles and grunt law-enforcement lingo—the kind of crime-genre pablum that commonly gets thrown onto Netflix in mid-January. But this one comes with a ridiculously stacked cast, including, most important, its two leads: Ben Affleck and Matt Damon. The longtime Hollywood pals have dutifully hit the promotional circuit to talk up their latest collaboration, as well as argue over who’s the bigger New England Patriots fan, reminisce on their former shared bank account, and generally remind everyone about the wholesome endurance of their creative bond.

But none of that cheerfulness or easy friend chemistry can be found in the film they’re plugging. Damon and Affleck have acted together on-screen numerous times, but this is their first time sharing the top billing since Dogma, their 1999 dark comedy about a pair of fallen angels. The hiatus makes The Rip the kind of nostalgia-inducing star vehicle that should pique viewers’ curiosity—which is why its seeming disinterest in the leads’ personal connection is so bizarre. Affleck plays the Miami Police Department detective J. D. Byrne, and Damon is his superior, Lieutenant Dane Dumars. Byrne and Dumars get drawn into a conspiracy surrounding a colossal stash of illicit money, which is coveted by cartel leaders and crooked cops alike. Carnahan, however, seems more interested in depicting realistic police procedure than in letting the famous friends have much fun together.

That The Rip is such a bland venue for its charismatic stars’ reunion is a terrible shame. They do look the part, sporting big beards and close-cropped hair; their brows are eternally furrowed and their eyes are constantly narrowed as their characters try to sniff out each other’s loyalty and the loyalty of other teammates drawn in by “the rip” (the $20 million they’ve just discovered). If this film had been made in the ’80s or ’90s, it would be crackling with zippy one-liners—which writers including Shane Black (Lethal Weapon) were paid top dollar to sprinkle into every script. Instead, Carnahan, who’s made other weighty masculine dramas such as Narc, The Grey, and Copshop, is mostly devoted to exploring how a large sum of money starts breeding suspicion among colleagues.

As Dumars and Byrne, Damon and Affleck are reduced to growling law-enforcement speak, barking into walkie-talkies and carrying out every conversation while at least one hand rests on an automatic weapon—just in case someone bursts through the wall. The supporting cast, including Teyana Taylor, Steven Yeun, Kyle Chandler, and Catalina Sandino Moreno, all get their own assault rifle and dictionary of cop lingo. But it seems they’re more likely on board not because of the material but because of the allure of working with Damon and Affleck. (Perhaps also appealing is the fact that the duo’s production company, Artists Equity, worked out a profit-sharing model with Netflix.) The Rip has little else to offer the actors or the audience beyond a plot built on ratcheting up tension and double-crossing characters.

I’m not sure why this is the movie Damon and Affleck decided to reunite as co-leads for. In the lead-up to The Rip’s release, the pair gave context for the long hiatus they took as artistic collaborators. They didn’t want to be seen as a double act, they explained; the media had quickly regarded Damon and Affleck as such after they co-starred in and won the Oscar for Best Original Screenplay for Good Will Hunting. The film, which they wrote together in their early 20s, when they were toiling away on small projects, launched them to megastardom.

Their careers as A-listers have differed quite dramatically, however. Damon became a model of consistency: He headed up robust franchises with the Jason Bourne and Ocean’s movies while also churning out work with serious auteurs such as Martin Scorsese, the Coen brothers, and Christopher Nolan. Affleck’s experience with fame was a roller coaster; he appeared in and out of the tabloids and had multiple declines and comebacks. He’s played two different comic-book superheroes, married two different superstars, and become a celebrated director in his own right, even winning Best Picture at the Oscars for Argo. Yet he’s struggled to maintain a similar artistic quality to Damon, bouncing between high highs (such as Gone Girl) and low lows (perhaps most infamously the box-office bomb Gigli).

Damon and Affleck’s proper post-Dogma on-screen reunion came with Ridley Scott’s The Last Duel in 2021, which the pair co-wrote. The movie was a financial disappointment, but it was well reviewed. They followed that up with Air in 2023, a lighter true-story dramedy about Nike’s courtship of Michael Jordan in the 1980s. In both films, Damon took the lead role and Affleck played a princely supporting character who would swoop in for some comic relief—a fine balance they first established in Good Will Hunting, and one that recalled what drew audiences to them all those years ago. But neither reunion was the total head-to-head that some fans might have longed for.

Watch the promotional videos for The Rip and it’s clear why people may clamor for Damon and Affleck to revive their dynamic. They’re not play-acting their friendship for the cameras; they have a deep, shared history, and are canny about how Hollywood has changed in the decades since they tried breaking into the industry together. (For the record, they’ve been pals since Damon, age 10, met Affleck, age 8, at school.) Their real-world mix of camaraderie and quiet rivalry, however, is a vein they’ve somehow rarely tapped on-screen. Off-screen, Affleck has a slightly rougher star persona, while Damon’s can be a little more withdrawn and intellectual. Their characters in The Rip, meanwhile, left me frustrated by their similarity: They’re essentially just playing two sides of the same coin.

Then again, maybe Damon and Affleck are smart to produce a movie like The Rip. Grumbly action dramas seem to play well on streaming services this time of year, when awards season is dying down and viewers turn to something a little trashier. The movie is hardly a catastrophe; it is just a by-the-book, somewhat forgettable little notch in the crime genre. I’m glad Damon and Affleck are comfortable carrying a film together now, after working hard to establish themselves as individuals. But I’d love to see the actors’ chummy New England competitiveness translate beyond the press-tour TikToks and return to the screen—using the differences that make their partnership intriguing to their benefit.</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Kristi Noem, the secretary of homeland security, has become an evangelist of a certain sort. During her tenure, her department has on multiple occasions released slick social-media recruitment videos in which scripture verses feature prominently.

One video quotes from Isaiah 6:8 (“Then I heard the voice of the Lord, saying, ‘Whom shall I send and who will go for us?’ I said, ‘Here I am. Send me.’”); another quotes from Proverbs 28:1 (“The wicked flee when no man pursueth; but the righteous are as bold as a lion.”). The most recent DHS video quotes from Jesus’s Sermon on the Mount: “Blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be called sons of God.

What’s striking is less that the federal government is using Bible verses in its promotional videos than that the agency doing the recruiting is Immigration and Customs Enforcement. The videos, set to music, include militaristic images. They show heavily armed agents in tactical gear, weapons drawn, donning masks, looking through night-vision goggles, zip-lining from helicopters, breaking down doors, and conducting nighttime raids.

From the February 2025 issue: The army of God comes out of the shadows

The message the Trump administration is sending is not subtle: ICE is doing the work of God. The brutal and sometimes lethal tactics being used by a growing number of ICE agents are divinely sanctioned. Come join this holy campaign.  Leni Riefenstahl would have approved.

THE KILLING OF RENEE NICOLE GOOD by an ICE agent, Jonathan Ross, has thrust the Department of Homeland Security into the red-hot center of American politics.

A horrifying video of Good being shot—one recent poll found that 82 percent of voters have watched it—provoked nationwide protests and vigils.

Noem, for her part, claimed that Good “committed an act of domestic terrorism” before she was shot four times at point-blank range. After Ross shot Good, a voice on one video could be heard calling her a “fucking bitch.” The Justice Department, meanwhile, is now investigating Good’s widow, prompting six federal prosecutors in Minnesota to resign.

The shooting in Minneapolis wasn’t surprising; under Donald Trump, and especially his immensely powerful aide Stephen Miller, ICE has become militarized, much larger, more aggressive, and less accountable. One former high-ranking Trump-administration official described ICE to me as a “paramilitary police force” under the control of Trump and Miller. (This person requested anonymity for fear of death threats.)

Miller has declared that agents possess “federal immunity,” while Vice President J. D. Vance has said they have “absolute immunity.” Trump, perhaps hoping for a confrontation, wrote on social media on Tuesday, “FEAR NOT, GREAT PEOPLE OF MINNESOTA, THE DAY OF RECKONING & RETRIBUTION IS COMING!” Defense Department officials told The Washington Post that the Pentagon has ordered about 1,500 active-duty soldiers to prepare for a possible deployment to Minneapolis, after Trump threatened to invoke the Insurrection Act, despite opposition from state and local officials.

Federal agents have already flooded the streets of Minneapolis. It is a city under siege; residents there say it “feels like an invasion” and compare it to a “military occupation.” Which is precisely what Trump wants. This has been the game plan all along.

“Blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be called sons of God.”

The Bible-quoting videos that ICE is using to recruit agents have a certain logic behind them. DHS says it is looking to hire “brave and heroic Americans,” but it obviously has a special focus on recruiting young men who identify as Christians and whose attitudes and moral instincts align with Trump’s, especially on immigration. Majorities of white evangelicals favor deporting undocumented immigrants to foreign prisons in El Salvador, Rwanda, or Libya without allowing them to challenge their deportation in court (57 percent), and approve of placing immigrants who have entered the country illegally in internment camps (53 percent).

“It has become virtually impossible to write a survey question about immigration policy that is too harsh for white evangelicals to support,” Robert P. Jones, the president of the Public Religion Research Institute, recently wrote.

Tobias Cremer is a member of the European Parliament. His book The Godless Crusade argues that the rise of right-wing populism in the West and its references to religion are driven less by a resurgence of religious fervor than by the emergence of a new secular identity politics. Right-wing populists don’t view Christianity as a faith; rather, Cremer suggests, they use Christianity as a cultural identity marker of the “pure people” against external “others,” while in many cases remaining disconnected from Christian values, beliefs, and institutions.

Many right-wing populists, despite being secular, are successfully recruiting Christians to their cause. And rather than Christians leavening the secular right-wing movements, those movements are prying Christianity further and further away from the ethic and teachings of Jesus.

The Trump administration has gone one step further, inverting authentic Christian faith by selling in a dozen different ways cruelty and the will to power in the name of Jesus. It has welcomed Christians into a theological twilight zone, where the beatitudes are invoked on behalf of a political movement with authoritarian tendencies. This isn’t the first time in history such things have happened.

In the 1920s, within the German Evangelical Church, a movement emerged: Deutsche Christen, or “German Christians.” They became a “church party” that actively supported Adolf Hitler, who self-identified in public as a Christian, even as he privately despised Christianity as a weak religion. Many Germans believed that Hitler had been chosen by God to lead the German state.

The Deutsche Christen promoted the idea of a “heroic” Jesus, even an Aryan Jesus, who fought against the Jewish influence in German life. They were encouraged by the anti-Semitic writings of Martin Luther. In the Martin Luther Memorial Church in Mariendorf, built in 1935, a wood carving on the pulpit depicts Christ preaching to a small group that includes a helmet-wearing Wehrmacht soldier. The church included other Nazi imagery, including an Iron Cross in the church’s chandelier and a baptismal font adorned with a Nazi SA stormtrooper, his head bowed in prayer. The church reflected the desire to construct a Volkskirche—a church that would serve the nation.

This horrifying story isn’t without admirable counterpoints. The Bekennende Kirche, or “Confessing Church,” arose in response to the Deutsche Christen movement. Its most prominent members, including Dietrich Bonhoeffer and Martin Niemöller, were key in publishing the Theological Declaration of Barmen, one of the most significant religious documents of the 20th century. But ultimately the Bekennende Kirche was forced underground and defeated; Bonhoeffer was hanged at the Flossenbürg concentration camp.

America in 2026 is not Germany in 1936; far from it. But we would be mistaken to pretend that political movements that aren’t as malevolent as Nazism can’t still advance sinister ends. We should also acknowledge that over the course of its history, Christianity, which has had glorious moments, has also taken some very dark turns.

Huge numbers of American fundamentalists and evangelicals—not just cultural Christians, but also those who faithfully attend church and Bible-study sessions and prayer gatherings—prefer the MAGA Jesus to the real Jesus. Few of them would say so explicitly, though, because the cognitive dissonance would be too unsettling. And so they have worked hard to construct rationalizations. It’s rather remarkable, really, to see tens of millions of Christians validate, to themselves and to one another, a political movement led by a malignant narcissist—who is driven by hate and bent on revenge, who mocks the dead, and who delights in inflicting pain on the powerless. The wreckage to the Christian faith is incalculable, yet most evangelicals will never break with him. They have invested too much of themselves and their identity in Trump and what he stands for.

This moment, and what it reveals about American Christianity, will be studied for a long time to come. I imagine that when future generations consider those who corrupted their faith in the name of their faith, those who were in positions of spiritual authority and knew better but still kept quiet, and those who bravely spoke out despite the costs, they will get the verdict right.

Several years ago I had a conversation with a theologian, a scholar of Søren Kierkegaard, who told me, “Christianity has in many cases stopped being the home to Jesus.” That, I fear, is the crux of the issue. Christians need to provide the world evidence of the compelling beauty and truth of God, but we cannot show the world what we ourselves cannot see. “Too late have I loved you, O Beauty so ancient, O Beauty so new,” Augustine wrote in his Confessions. It was Augustine’s lament that it had taken him so many years to discover the beauty of the divine. But having discovered it, he was changed by it.

Elizabeth Bruenig: The Catholic Church and the Trump administration are not getting along

Some time ago, it dawned on me that many Christians attempt to evangelize on behalf of a God we wish we knew but whom we do not really and fully know. We have committed to memory the phrases we tell one another. I have wondered sometimes if we mouth those words in the hopes that doing so will change our hearts.

There are shining counterexamples, of course, including people I have met along the journey who can authentically claim, “Thou and thou only, first in my heart; High King of Heaven, my treasure thou art.” But they are the exception, and it does no one any good to deny it. “Christianity has not produced Christlike people on any meaningful scale,” a theologian once told me. That is vividly evident in American politics today, but it is hardly the only domain in which that is true. And until it is less true, we have very little to teach the rest of the world.

My hope, as a Christian, is that those of us who claim to be followers of Jesus will soon discover what Augustine discovered later than he had wished. That we will fall more in love with Beauty so ancient, Beauty so new. That in doing so in a broken world, we will stand out as expressing our faith through love. That we will be repairers of the breach, true peacemakers. And that we will “shine as stars in the world.” The world would be better for it, and so would we.</div>

            <h2>Davos Man May Burn the Whole Thing Down</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-01-21</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/national-security/2026/01/greenland-davos-trump-nato/685688/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Franklin D. Roosevelt famously illustrated with a simple metaphor the need for a healthy transatlantic alliance. Justifying his decision to lend Great Britain warships and other military supplies in the early days of World War II, Roosevelt likened it to loaning a neighbor a garden hose to put out the fire consuming his house. Sure, Roosevelt charitably wanted to help a neighbor in need. But it was self-interested too; if the neighbor could extinguish the blaze, it wouldn’t spread to FDR’s home. The United States benefited from the friendship—and the buffer—that allies could provide.

Today, Donald Trump will fly to Europe. Ukraine is already ablaze. And now the president is ready to set a bunch of new houses on fire.

The president will speak at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, tomorrow, and he appears prepared to shatter the nearly 80-year-old NATO alliance in order to seize Greenland. In his quest to claim a strategically located island of ice and rock, Trump has turned against his nation’s most stalwart friends. He has antagonized and mocked panicked European leaders, threatened punishing tariffs on countries that object to his plans, and pointedly not ruled out using military force. Trump’s thirst for Greenland—even if he stops short of ordering an armed invasion—threatens to unravel the partnership born from the ashes of World War II that has, in the decades since, ensured the spread of peace, prosperity, and democracy on both sides of the Atlantic.

Today marks one year since Trump’s return to office, and in that time, he has fundamentally reshaped the United States’ relationship with the rest of the world. But nothing has upended the global order more than what would happen if he follows through on his threats toward Greenland. The island, of course, belongs to Denmark, which says that it is not available for the taking. Troops from Europe have been dispatched to the territory, and Greenland’s prime minister warned his populace to prepare for an invasion. If Trump were to persist, Denmark could trigger NATO’s Article 5 mutual-defense pact, and then the unthinkable could occur: American soldiers firing on Europeans while Russian President Vladimir Putin’s dream of NATO’s self-immolation is thoroughly realized.

The annual meetings in Davos, normally a clubby gathering of business titans and political leaders, have been consumed by talk of what Trump may or may not do. European leaders have found themselves scrambling on strategy—appeasement? Defiance? Compromise? Early this morning, Trump posted screenshots of text messages that revealed the dilemma facing those leaders. (Lesson to everyone: Be careful what you text the guy unless you want the world to see.)

In one message, Mark Rutte—the secretary general of NATO, who has prized warm relations with Trump—praised the president’s foreign policies, then vowed that he is “committed to finding a way forward on Greenland.” But in another, French President Emmanuel Macron, whose relationship with Trump has been turbulent, admitted: “I do not understand what you are doing on Greenland.” In fact, Trump couldn’t be more clear, as he demonstrated once again by circulating a pair of presumably AI-generated images on social media. In one, he’s planting an American flag in Greenland. In the other, he’s lecturing European leaders in the Oval Office with a map behind him that depicts Greenland as part of the United States. (Canada and Venezuela too.)

Trolling close U.S. allies has seemingly been an unofficial policy of Trump’s second administration since its first days, beginning with Vice President Vance lecturing Europe in Munich on the virtues of free speech. But this time feels different for those nervously waiting in snowy Switzerland. The president’s address to the forum tomorrow is poised to be a defining moment, and Trump plans to make the unequivocal case that the United States should have Greenland, a senior White House official told me. For now, the administration is focused on purchasing Greenland or offering economic incentives to its residents and to those in Denmark, aides told me. But they are not ruling out the use of military force or economic pressure. The senior official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to candidly discuss internal strategy, added that the White House is considering joint military exercises, withholding participation in NATO, and additional tariffs. (The Supreme Court has continued to delay its ruling on the legality of Trump’s tariffs, keeping that tool in play here.)

Yet even as the administration brandishes trade as a first-strike weapon, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent delivered this message in Davos today to European allies: “Sit back. Take a deep breath. Do not retaliate.” He added again: “Do not retaliate.” (Europe did not say that it would listen.) But Trump’s audacious power play won’t stop there: While in Davos, he’s also expected to lean on foreign leaders to join his fledgling Board of Peace, which includes a $1 billion price tag for permanent membership. A number of European heads of state expressed reservations about the board—including that it has a seat earmarked for Putin, who seemed to celebrate the invitation by launching a massive strike against Kyiv this morning. When Macron suggested that he would not join, Trump angrily threatened higher tariffs.

And now he has a new grudge: After being denied the Nobel Peace Prize that he covets, Trump this week registered his bitter complaints with the prime minister of Norway, writing that because of the snub, “I no longer feel an obligation to think purely of Peace,” while incorrectly claiming that Denmark’s ownership of Greenland is not supported by “written documents, it’s only a boat that landed there hundreds of years ago.”

Some greeted the note with fact-checks and derision. But not the White House: Officials proudly distributed it for all to read.

Greenland is more than just ice and rock—and it has more strategic importance than looking really big on certain maps. Its location is key for Arctic defense and trade routes. It’s rich in minerals. And, yes, Trump has cited those factors as he has declared the island vital for U.S. national security. But Denmark has repeatedly counter-declared that it would happily grant many of Trump’s new demands. Want to build a new military base? Sure! Name it after yourself? Just ask! Yet Trump’s lust for Greenland goes beyond that, people close to him have told me. It’s about increasing American dominance in the Western Hemisphere and redrawing the maps of the world. The island is roughly 836,000 square miles, which would make it the largest territorial addition in U.S. history, eclipsing the Louisiana Purchase and the acquisition of Alaska. It would be something for the history books, the people close to him have said. And that’s what Trump is focused on.

Recent polls are clear: Americans strongly disapprove of an attempt to seize Greenland, especially by force. But Trump has been gazing past the midterms and toward his own legacy. A look back at his two previous appearances at Davos illustrates Trump’s evolution. In 2018, he was willing to be something of a deferential guest, shelving some of his nationalist ideology and even saying, “‘America First’ does not mean America alone.” He continued: “When the United States grows, so does the world.” (Hard to believe, I know.) And then, in early 2020, he offered a fairly standard campaign speech, boasting about American progress but evincing little care about what happens beyond the United States’ own borders. That is not the case in Trump 2.0.

At the one-year mark, Trump’s foreign policy has been defined by rampant interventionism. Although he has not ended as many conflicts as he claims (Trump’s count is eight and growing), the U.S. has played a mediator role in global hot spots, most notably in Gaza. After months of watching the violence, the president pressured both Israel and Hamas to reach a deal to release the hostages and implement a fragile cease-fire. But he’s also continued to erode the U.S.-led global order, instigating risky diplomatic and economic fights with allies. He has not consistently focused on the threat posed by China. His attention to the war in Ukraine has come and gone, but he continues to reflexively defer to Putin. Part of why European leaders were at first slow to challenge Trump’s Greenland rhetoric was that they didn’t want to provoke him into completely abandoning Kyiv, officials there have told me.

Trump has also fallen in love with the concept of one-and-done military interventions: the bombing of Iran’s nuclear facilities, the strikes on alleged terrorist targets in Syria and Nigeria, and, of course, the capture of the Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro earlier this month. Aides have boasted that the Caracas operation was a turning point for the presidency; after limping to the finish of 2025 amid a series of electoral defeats, poor polls, and scandals, Trump seems reinvigorated. He is unchecked domestically—Minneapolis is under siege by federal forces—and internationally. He has been emboldened and has shown a new willingness to use force. In the hours before Air Force One was scheduled to lift off for Switzerland today, Trump was asked by a reporter how far he’d “be willing to go” to obtain Greenland.

Meanwhile, Europe waits. And watches for smoke.</div>

            <h2>A Surprising Change in Trump’s Behavior</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-01-20</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/newsletters/2026/01/one-year-trump-lessons/685686/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">This is an edition of The Atlantic Daily, a newsletter that guides you through the biggest stories of the day, helps you discover new ideas, and recommends the best in culture. Sign up for it here.

Donald Trump retains the ability to shock; the day he loses that, he will, like the biblical Samson—another man notable for his coiffure—lose his power entirely. When Trump started his second term as president a year ago, however, I doubted whether there was much more to learn about how his mind works. Even before he’d entered politics, Trump was overexposed. Since then, he has become the most scrutinized person in the world. His tendencies and foibles are well known to voters, politicians, and world leaders.

Yet in breaking one of his most entrenched patterns, he has provided perhaps the biggest surprise of the past year. During his first term, Trump was defined by his tendency to back down in any negotiation or fight: As I put it in a May 2018 article, he almost always folded, agreeing to concessions whether he was negotiating on trade with China or a budget resolution with Senate Democrats. More recently, though, he’s been following through, no matter how aberrant his ideas. The exact reason for this is difficult to pin down, though it likely includes the fact that he has more experience under his belt, fewer prudent voices in his ear, and a lame duck’s liberation from having to worry about reelection. In any case, his new determination is forcing countries around the world to reassess how to deal with him.

Nowhere is this so clear right now as with Trump’s continued pressure to acquire Greenland. In the wee hours of this morning, Trump went on a social-media spree, posting (among other things) an illustration of himself, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, and J. D. Vance planting a U.S. flag in Greenland. European leaders seem to slowly be coming to the conclusion that this isn’t just a feint.

When the president began making noise about taking the Danish territory early last year, many observers were baffled but not necessarily all that concerned—an impulse reinforced when the matter receded from Trump’s attention in the months that followed. They also had a long track record to draw on. In May 2017, I wrote that “foreign leaders have realized Trump is a pushover.” This held true for adversaries (China) and allies (Taiwan, NATO) alike throughout his first term.

It was especially true for rivals such as Russia and North Korea. Trump talked a fierce game—promising “fire and fury” for Pyongyang, for example—but his counterparts understood that despite his insistence that he was a master dealmaker, all they needed was to get him to a negotiating table. “Faced with a tough decision, the president has consistently blinked, giving in to his opponents,” I wrote in my 2018 article.

This pattern was clear enough that when Trump refused to concede the 2020 election, even his allies were dismissive. “What is the downside for humoring him for this little bit of time?” a senior Republican official told The Washington Post in November 2020. “It’s not like he’s plotting how to prevent Joe Biden from taking power on January 20.” That was exactly what he was doing, however ham-handedly. The effort to subvert the election was also a warning of things to come.

Even so, Trump’s return to office initially suggested more of the same tendency to back down. This past May (why is it always May?), I wrote about Wall Street’s “TACO trade”—short for “Trump Always Chickens Out”—in which stock traders bet against the president following through on tariff threats and then profiting when he folded and markets went up. And they were right, to an extent: Although Trump did impose extensive tariffs, the eventual levels were much lower than initially announced, thanks in part to lobbying by foreign governments. Trump’s resolve remains weak in some areas; he’s swung wildly on Ukraine and Russia, his position shifting depending on whom he last spoke to.

But in other ways, the pattern has started to break. Just ask Nicolás Maduro, who reportedly rejected negotiated exile in Turkey, perhaps wagering that Trump would never actually launch a military strike on Venezuela to capture him. It was a bad bet. Now Trump seems energized and has turned his attention to Greenland. U.S. allies—or people who until recently thought of themselves as allies—are scrambling to figure out how to react. Can they draw things out long enough for Trump to lose interest? Can they appease him somehow? Or do they need, as Eliot Cohen argued in The Atlantic this past weekend, to show a willingness to resist the United States militarily?

Trump is acting emboldened domestically too. He is once again threatening to invoke the Insurrection Act to deploy troops to Minneapolis, where he seems determined to immiserate the entire city. Before his first term, Trump had threatened to prosecute political rivals, but he was stymied by his aides during his presidency. This time, he’s going through with it. In a New Yorker profile this week of Representative LaMonica McIver, a New Jersey Democrat charged with assault for a fracas at an ICE facility, Representative Lateefah Simon, a California Democrat, said, “Typically, we would say, ‘Oh, they’re just trying to scare her.’” But this is much more than fearmongering: “They’re actively litigating this case,” Simon noted. (McIver has pleaded not guilty.)

Signs of new resistance have started to emerge in parallel with Trump’s newfound resolve. Republican members of Congress have begun pushing back—far less than one would expect even in a normal presidency, but more than in Trump’s previous term or in the early days of this one. They were able to force his hand on the Epstein files, though whether they have the courage to hold him to account for slow-walking the files’ release is not yet clear. As my colleague Anne Applebaum wrote yesterday, Congress will need to do much more to halt any Greenland fiasco. Foreign leaders will need to take a harder line too. When Trump was a pushover, it was more understandable, if not wiser, to wonder, What is the downside of humoring him? Now the downsides are clear and dangerous.

Here are three new stories from The Atlantic:

Trump’s Golden Age of Culture Seems Pretty Sad So Far

Trump’s return to office was widely portrayed as christening a new definition of chic. Young voters and voters of color had swung in his direction, thanks partly to the influence of podcasts, livestreams, and other media formats that now compete with traditional news outlets and cultural institutions. The attendance of tech barons, comedians, and content creators at Trump’s inauguration indicated that the so-called alternative media was now the mainstream—and openly pro-Trump. Its touchstones appeared to be recently booming phenomena including country music, TikTok tradwives, and mixed martial arts.

Trump quickly began consolidating his cultural power by focusing on the old media that hadn’t fallen in line.

Get inspired. Exercise isn’t just a break from sitting at a desk—it also acts as an extra twist to open the tap of creativity, Bonnie Tsui argues.

            <div id="article-text">In Princeton, New Jersey, a short stroll from the university you have heard of, there lies a little campus home to the Institute for Advanced Study. It was founded in 1930 not to confer degrees nor—God forbid!—to make money, nor even to conduct research toward any end in particular. The institute proclaims that its purpose is “the pursuit of knowledge for its own sake.”

Founder Abraham Flexner reckoned that brilliant minds, once freed to pursue “useless satisfactions,” would stumble upon discoveries of “undreamed-of utility,” as he wrote in a magazine a few years into the institute’s work. It seems to have worked for Albert Einstein, who had an office there. J. Robert Oppenheimer, too.

Enjoy this week’s useless satisfactions. I look forward to your theory of everything the week after.

And by the way, did you know that throughout the history of the Nobel Prizes, there have been years so turbulent that the Peace Prize committee determined not to confer an award, even as other categories went on?

This happened in a few of the interwar years as Nazi Germany rearmed, Italy invaded Ethiopia, and peace generally disintegrated. It was also the case for the years of World War I, with the exception of 1917, when the committee recognized the Red Cross for its humanitarian aid. (All of the Nobel Prizes were suspended during the early years of World War II.)

The circumstances were a bit different in 1948, when the committee ruled that “there was no suitable living candidate.” The clear message was that the award—which by rule cannot be given posthumously—should have gone to Mahatma Gandhi, assassinated earlier that year.

Google disables the &#39;tool&#39; that lets people put captions in the middle of videos, obscuring whatever the fuck the video is?

Pretty sure captions are not shown unless you enable them.  The only way to unconditionally get them shown is to bake them right into the video itself.

SRV3 has been disabled while Google works on a simpler, more reliable caption system where every sentence is replaced with “ upbeat music ”.

US&#39;s 3-Mile-Island accident may explain Orangezilla. That boy ain&#39;t right in the head. He thinks peace prizes are to be incentives for peace, not rewards.

If Donald is actually Christian, then I&#39;m Clark Kent. MAGAs don&#39;t even read the New Testament, only listen to the parts Hannity cherry-picks.

They&#39;ve already swallowed major fantasy improbables based on what they&#39;re told, how to interpret their book, what local leaders say, and not their own assessment of reality.So if anyone can believe the nonsense that the guy guilty of fraud, rape, money laundering, theft, constant lying, serial adultery, ignorant of church and church teachings, is actually a savior picked by God, it could be these guys.

Logical Fallacy: Most liberals agree with ALL opinions of a particular Beatle. Should I likewise paint all MAGAs with the might-makes-right opinions of Stephen Miller?

Addendum: I&#39;m assuming you are (mis) quoting the lyrics of John Lennon&#39;s &quot;Imagine&quot;. If not, then I have no idea what you are talking about.

To me &quot;American values&quot; are democracy, checks & balances on the powerful, freedom of political speech, freedom of and from religion; rewarding logic,  honesty, and humility; and sincere learning from mistakes.

If the maggots are voting for more Nazi shit, yes. Fucking absolutely yes. Ignorance is no excuse for deliberately supporting terrible things.

Japan seems to have repeated bad luck with nuclear technologies. While I don&#39;t condone superstitiousness, I can understand their population&#39;s hesitancy.

First, in the Japanese cultural psyche nuclear power is a very prominent thing.  Japan has the dubious distinction of being the only country in the world to have been hit with nuclear weapons in anger, and the cultural sho

For those who need a refresher as to how the failure of the Fukushima reactors, see this video:

Understanding the accident of Fukushima Daiichi (from 2012)https://youtu.be/YBNFvZ6Vr2U [youtu.be]

Total time:  13:01.  The key bit is at 4:49:  &quot;The waves went over the sea wall flooding the lower parts of buildings, and disabled the emergency diesel generators.&quot;

Had those generators and fuel tanks been higher up in the structure, things probably would have been fine, but with the reactors in control-rod shutdown and needing to dissipate the residual heat in the reaction chambers, the secondary cooling systems powered by those emergency diesel generators were absolutely crucial.

They had multiple generators. All were at the same height because they decided not to put them on pylons (obligatory build more...) because the people in the surrounding area said they didn&#39;t want to look at them. Or maybe that&#39;s just an excuse for saving money... And just look how much they saved in the end! Er, wait

that all nuclear accidents to date were from gen 1 reactors.

Let Elon Musk get involved, that will change quickly.

Just a reminder that all nuclear accidents to date were from gen 1 reactors.

That is, if we&#39;re not using the U.S. Department of Energy&#39;s formal generational scheme, where gen 2 [wikipedia.org] includes e.g. Chernobyl&#39;s reactor that exploded. So, what you mean is that every serious accident happened in older-era reactors built before modern designs with passive safety features.

Worth noting: Kashiwazaki-Kariwa Nuclear Power Plant wasn’t offline because it was unsafe to operate, but because Japan rewrote its nuclear rulebook after Fukushima. The post-2011 requirements are much stricter (earthquakes, tsunamis, backup power, security), and it’s taken years to get approvals. Reactor 6 got through first since it’s newer and already had upgrades.

The restart push is mostly about energy reality: Japan imports most of its fuel, LNG got expensive, and cutting emissions without nuclear is hard. Local opposition is still a factor though, especially given the seismic risks, which is why the rest of the plant is still years away from full operation — if it ever gets there.

No, they decided to shut them down, partly for safety concerns, partly for political concerns

imo AI art should never have been allowed at Comic-Con.aren&#39;t these venues for NOSTALGIA?

Or maybe the prompt and AI model should be required.

Anything created with aesthetics in mind is art, even if it&#39;s shit.

Disallowing AI generated art is perfectly valid though, it&#39;s their show.

Anything created with aesthetics in mind is art, even if it&#39;s shit.Created? Yeah. Generated can fuck off.

Anything created with aesthetics in mind is art, even if it&#39;s shit.

So if a Photoshop filter is used then it&#39;s out?

If not, where do you draw the line between human effort and tool use?

In both cases the human must adjust parameters to get the desired effect, and the work is done by machine.

Reducing the discussion to &quot;a computer did it for them&quot; isn&#39;t insightful.

Even if the creator claims it is art.And the current chat AI is more like a copy machine, although it is not totally impossible that it might make art someday.By the way, the proper designation is &quot;Artificial Stupid&quot; (AS), sometimes written as &quot;Artificial Stupid System&quot;  8-)

Well, that&#39;s certainly a fine demonstration of elitism.

Or maybe not and any one who claims to be an &quot;artist&quot; while presenting ai should be laughed out of the room.You have a valid point, it is not created but generated, however - as always - it is not so easy to mark the line, as AFAIK all (most) computer graphics programs use AI for some options/features.We also have a precedence with introduction of photography - painters of that time for sure claimed it is not art and should be banned from the art exhibitions.I will sustain my suggestion of allowing as a separate category.

aren&#39;t these venues for NOSTALGIA?You misspelled &quot;MARKETING&quot;

Would have been informative if the summary gave the ACTUAL new policy, instead of just &quot;they changed the policy&quot; without saying what they changed it to.

From the article, the new policy is straightforward:

“Material created by Artificial Intelligence (AI) either partially or wholly, is not allowed in the art show,” it now says. AI is now banned at the art show.

* The article implies it&#39;s possible to distinguish between AI art and art made without AI. In other words, if someone at ComicCon were to present AI art as non-AI art, it would be possible to distinguish between the two. I don&#39;t know if this is true. If it isn&#39;t, then this policy of banning AI art may only result in people saying that the art isn&#39;t AI generated, when it is. Or, it could lead to an evolutionary pursuit by the creators of AI art, so that eventually one can&#39;t tell t

There are lots of situations where a post-event or post-display scrutiny reveals something to fail to comply or to otherwise be in-violation.

The simple solution is to blacklist the individuals or companies that violate the rules if their violations are discovered, and to enable to event organizers a reasonably wide latitude in responding to complaints made and making their decisions based on how a given accused violator responds.

It is accepted practice to hire people to prepair canvas (or what is used) and paint backgrounds, and has been since the Middle Ages. So maybe having an AI do that is acceptable?

Don&#39;t assume the AI is perfect, at least some people can tell the difference. And it seems like some &quot;creators&quot; are intentionally putting in mistakes.

Just because something is on a computer does not make iot perfect, I make my living fixing such stuff...

Interesting! So, can you tell the difference between AI art and non-AI art? Also, when you &quot;correct mistakes&quot; made by AI art, do you think it&#39;s then not AI art?

...* There&#39;s no definition of &quot;AI art&quot; in the article. For instance, what if you use AI to create the art but make changes to it, without using a computer-aided process? Is it still AI art?The policy seems pretty clear on that. &quot;Material created by Artificial Intelligence (AI) either partially or wholly, is not allowed in the art show,” If it was created with AI, making changes to it changes it from wholly AI to partially AI, but it is still not allowedHow many changes would you need to make, theoretically, in order to distinguish between art that&#39;s mostly human and art that&#39;s mostly AI?The policy looks pretty clear. The changes you would need to make would be to discard the AI art and make a different thing without AI.

AI art can be fun, but since it requires no effort to create, it should not be sold.It should clearly be identified as AI, and if the prompt that created it includes a reference to a human artist, the artist should be credited.Even better, the model and prompt should be displayed along with the piece.

People can pay for the fake art with fake money.

I get it, this is a private event by a private company and they have the right to set whatever rules they wantBut why stop at the arbitrary cutoff at AI which practically is 5-ish year old technology

Why not go full luddite and require art to be created the way it was 100 years ago?

There were special effects in movies 100 years ago. Just watch Charlie Chaplin movies or MetropolisBooks were typed on mechanical typewriters. None of them digital or even electric typewriters or spellcheckers.Photographs were cre

Because AI doesn&#39;t require anything more than a text-prompt, while other methods of producing images or videos require individuals to apply their own creative efforts to the process.

I can&#39;t remember which event it was, but someone from youtube mentioned that when generative video AI came to the scene, youtube&#39;s data ingestion went up many times higher than normal.

To the point where they started to max out their data storage and had to start culling things.

It&#39;s bad enough that I have to see this crap in my feed. I used to be happy to watch a video from a creator with like 1-2 thousand subs, if it was any good I&#39;d leave a comment to boost engagement etc. But now it&#39;s pretty much a certainty that that kind of creator is AI slop and I see so many more of those in my recommendations than ever before. It&#39;s infuriating, it&#39;s just like spam in a mailbox.

But now youtube is literally deleting videos to make room for this stuff?? Seriously?? There are so many videos wh

I miss old YouTube. Back when &quot;Broadcast Yourself&quot; was a slogan. Back when people were making 3 to 7 minute videos to match an attention span raised on the Flash animations that preceded it, as opposed to trying to hit the magic 8:01 mark that allows midroll advertisements. Back when &quot;slop channel&quot; meant a channel full of a pig eating slop [youtube.com].

Seriously.  Slashdot Collective says &#39;eat the rich?&#39;  I say &quot;fuck all the techbros.&quot;

Yes, I&#39;m narrowing down the carnage to just the techbros (and tech sisters, like that nutjob that headed Theranos)

They&#39;ve unleashed a new cancer on society, by amplifying voices that were best left handing out flyers at street intersections.  Not everyone

I don&#39;t mind AI content (There&#39;s some good StarWars stuff that regular people can make now that is pretty good, tbh). But the Joe Rogan ads for crap needs to go!

If Youtube can make money by showing an ad then a real person should have to look at it first.  How hard would that be?  smh...

There is some good slop out there too.  I don&#39;t know how to quantify quality slop, but there is at least one channel putting out some very funny videos that are complete nonsense.  I would not want to see that go away but I don&#39;t think they are going for detecting AI vs not anyway.  They had a bad slop problem before AI.

Yeah, well worth the cost of YouTube premium. At least for me

Firefox + uBlock Origin still works fine. I&#39;m still unsure why Chrome is so popular, there never was a time when it was better than Firefox.

FWIW though, if you&#39;re getting Joe Rogan ads, it&#39;s because of your history, probably watching similar content. It is always worth, from time to time, clearing your cookies and logging in again (or starting a new account if they&#39;re tying ads to logins, which right now they don&#39;t appear to be, but are clearly preparing to do.)

^ This is the way. The way to fix ads was to cut ads out of our lives. It worked spectacularly well, IMHO. The only catch is that when you do it, it just works for you. So you&#39;ve got to advocate it to others, if you&#39;re worried about what other people might do while under the influence of ads (i.e. what if they vote?).

How did this guy keep his head from splitting in two the way he&#39;s talking out both sides of his mouth? Stop AI slop by creating more AI slop? What? Do these fools even listen to themselves anymore?

It&#39;s the &quot;low-quality AI slop&quot; they want to crack down on. They&#39;re actively pursuing AI systems that generate video on demand, either unique to each viewer or specific to demographics.

They don&#39;t like the &quot;low-quality AI slop&quot;, they want the high-quality AI slop, the AI-generated videos generated specifically for that individual that matches the algorithm.

And it&#39;s clear to everyone they want to be the ones generating the &quot;high-quality AI videos&quot; to cut the content creators

Exactly. They&#39;re not dumping AI content. They&#39;re doubling down on making AI content indistinguishable from content generated by humans.

The majority of ads I see on YouTube these days are AI-slop deepfake celebrity endorsements, obviously-fake (and dangerous) medical scams, weight-loss salts, workout plans, etc. etc. I don&#39;t see anything in the CEO statement about that.

And it pops up a menu where i can select both subtitles and voice language, and make this button remember the setting for all videos.Is this THAT hard?

Trouble is AI slop is making YouTube a ton of money showing ads.  Even if all the real creators were driven away, AI slop would still be bringing in the money.  The trouble is most of YouTube&#39;s users don&#39;t seem to know or care that it&#39;s slop.

Very disheartening article on this:  https://fortune.com/2025/12/30... [fortune.com] .  There&#39;s no way YouTube will pull the plug on this. If it&#39;s making this kid $700,000 a year, YouTube themselves are making far more, despite having to store all that slop.

One time I got &#39;fed&#39; a series videos of basically babies being in precarious (dangerous) situations, only to be saved by a cat (with the parents&#39; voices in the background calling the cat &#39;good&#39; for saving the baby - yeah, that absurd). They were all obviously AI generated (like how the baby &#39;about to fall off the stairs&#39; went physically through the railing posts somehow, to say nothing of the weirdness of the stairs themselves).

Of course there were some idiots that actually believed the obvious fake videos

In Vernor Vinge&#39;s &quot;Rainbows End&quot; (scifi written in the &#39;00s but takes place approximately around now) there is a thing called &quot;Friends of Privacy&quot; which makes it hard to find relevant information about a person, by overwhelming the truth with a sea of spam/misinformation. If you google your ex-wife and get 200 different possible addresses (all of them credible), then you don&#39;t have her address.

I thought that was unrealistic and wouldn&#39;t really happen, of course it&#39;s starting to happen.

He says they are going to combat AI Slop, in the same breath as he says they are rolling out tools to make creating it easier.

I don&#39;t think this guy understands what most people think &quot;AI Slop&quot; even is. &quot;Remixing existing content&quot;, *IS* slop. It is low effort, low value, garbage.

LLMâ(TM)s have legitimate useful business cases that can save employees hours.

Guess where LLM isnâ(TM)t being applied rapidly?

An LLM tha can scan a pdf and then either create database entries or an importable file that creates the database entries would save workers hours a week.

It isnâ(TM)t sexy it isnâ(TM)t ground breaking  it can save small busin

That is an absolutely terrible application for an LLM.  There are, and have been, alternative approaches that are far more accurate, predictable, reliable, and less expensive. If you&#39;re using an LLM for that now, you are, without question, paying significantly more for worse results.

Think scan a packing slip or order acknowledgement pdf and import it.When you say &quot;scan a pdf&quot;... there&#39;s at least a 60% chance that you, or someone at your organization, regularly prints out PDFs and runs them through a scanner because scanning is one of the steps in the data entry process they

And as you note... those are all Solved Problems. Hell, they solved many of those problems back in the 60s and 70s with OMR, OCR, barcodes, &quot;just mailing out a punched card&quot; and other fun things that were mostly replaced with better OCR starting in the 1990s. You can literally get OCR-based extraction and routing in commercial products starting around $200. Not per month. One time, perpetual license. And if you go the open source route, free. Big Tech AI&#39;s only &quot;improvement&quot; on this model is making it more

There are times when AI can do things that normal humans can&#39;t, at least not efficiently.  But in their quest to make AI look like the new gold, corporate America and the world globalists are overselling it to the point where it becomes hated

On the other end, you have geniuses who think that they can put just 10% of their time & effort on their work, and toss the rest of it all to AI.  What they miss is that companies too are looking for areas where that can be done, so that they don&#39;t need to hire th

Seems like it&#39;d be a huge cost savings. And frankly, AI is more ethical than a sociopath, so it&#39;s a win-win.

Bubble bubble pop pop, bubble bubble pop.The world is getting tired of all your AI slop.The leaders all say it takes you to the top,But once you see the numbers, your hopes and dreams will drop.

Vendors all say the revolution has begun,The days of writing code are now all but done,The battle for human hearts and minds is won,Smart investors are gonna turn and run.

So you&#39;re saying, you can be easily replaced with AI.

AI is fantastic for doing things like summarizing points, doing things like booking appointments and following a preset of instructions with some variance.

It&#39;s also good for digging into things and getting research. It&#39;s also great at getting the mathematically most common opinion on almost any subject, but you need to be able to tell when it&#39;s making stuff up.

DEI would be I can&#39;t hire someone based on some quality not related to their skill, so need to hire the &quot;most skilled&quot; &#39;worker for that position, whatever that is.

Although I&#39;m a chick, so I know from experience if I use my initials, I&#39;ll get more interviews than if I put my name, and modify nothing else on my resume, so I&#39;m probably blatantly biased in favor of DEI because I have personal experience with it. If you believe it means something else, you really need to sit down and read it.

Done properly, it looks something like Blind Auditions [wikipedia.org] which many orchestras use to eliminate bias when interviewing candidates, so they can focus specifically on the quality of music each person makes. Orchestras went from 99% male to 50/50.

As always, depends on the work, AI like any other tool has its strengths and weaknesses. Knowing our propensity for busy work though, we&#39;re probably going to end up with job positions for AI prompt copy editing soon enough, making sure the prompts made for the AI are properly formatted to minimize the chance of hallucinations. It&#39;s the usual wheel of tech, we&#39;ll eliminate a bunch of jobs, lots of people will be out of work due to not using the new skill, and we pay a premium for that skill until we can boil it down until that skill doesn&#39;t matter anymore.

What the CEOs are really saying is that AI is making THEIR work more efficient.  And since CEOs are just like normal people, AI must be making everyone&#39;s work more efficient too.  After all, no one has every accused a CEO of being myopic.

1. AI amplifies existing competence. Current AI systems are not autonomous problem-solvers -- they are accelerants. Users who already understand their domain can spot errors, ask better follow-up questions, and integrate outputs efficiently. For less experienced or less analytical workers, AI often creates rework rather than savings, which is consistent with the “AI tax” described in the surveys.

It’s not strictly about being “smart,” but also about task structure and feedback loops. Some highly capable workers are in environments where AI cannot be safely or efficiently applied (compliance-heavy workflows, fragmented tooling, high-stakes accuracy requirements).

2. Impact varies strongly by role, as knowledge work is not homogeneous. Roles involving synthesis, drafting, ideation, coding, analysis, or decision support benefit far more than roles dominated by coordination, approvals, interpersonal judgment, or rigid process constraints. Executive workflows are especially well suited to AI assistance, which explains the perception gap between leadership and individual contributors.

Also, adoption maturity matters. Many organizations have introduced AI without training, workflow redesign, or incentives, which predictably limits upside regardless of worker capability. Would it be exactly surprising to see this outcome? Not to me.

So let’s say you work at a company, and they have an OKR “use AI to improve productivity”.  If you aren’t familiar with OKRs, they are something that your manager tells you to do, and the more of them you do the more likely you are to get a raise, or bonus, or at least keep your job.  Sometimes they are flat out assigned to you, sometimes you get to pick off a list, sometimes you and your manager come up with them together.  You manager likely has an OKR handed down to them to get their employees to use more AI, so this isn’t a pure blue sky thought experiment.  It is a realistic situation.

So you end up with this OKR.  You can ignore it and at the end of performance cycle you can either fess up “I didn’t even try”, or you can say “I gave it a shot and AI didn’t help”, or you can flat out lie “AI helped some”, or “AI helped a lot”.   Which do you do?   Which do you do if you were also pretty lazy on the other OKRs and really have almost nothing good to report?   If you aren’t lazy yourself you already know any OKR with no real way to double check is something you report having achieved because you were too lazy to do any of ‘em.

If you aren’t lazy you have a bunch of OKRs that you actually managed to do (get 90% of TPS reports in on time, screen all your bugs at least twice a week, whatever).  You also likely have a few you didn’t, and you have this one here.  Maybe you didn’t bother with AI which gives you the chouces up above in “lazy”, or maybe you gave it a shot and it didn’t help, so you can report a failure, but you worked so hard on the other OKRs, do you really want to jeopardize your bonus because you have this AI OKR?

If you are super honest maybe you will report the AI OKR as a bust.  Maybe your company actually has a “if you aren’t failing at least 20% of your OKRs you didn’t set high enough expectations” policy, and sure you can pass or fail some number of the unverifiable OKRs as needed to hit that magic success rate...but that is rare, it is far more common for a company to treat OKRs as “more is better!”.

Plus even if you are fundamentally an honest person, I’m sure you used AI once or twice to summarize someone else’s long emails into something shorter and maybe inaccurate, but surly that saved time, right?  At least as long as they weren’t too inaccurate!   Or maybe you used it to fluff up a short email/report into something longer, even if you then spent just as long double checking that it isn’t now inaccurate as you would have fluffing it up yourself (plus now everyone else ends up with longer emails they use AI to summarize...).   Or you write code for a living, and you AI’ed up some code, and that saved you like 10 hours of coding, I mean it cost 45 hours of extra debugging, but you saved 10 hours somewhere, so you can report meeting your OKR without a lie!

If you are asked by someone outside your management chain, and outside your company the honest answer is somewhere between “I didn’t try”, to “it didn&#39;t help”, to “it saved me time in one place, but maybe cost me more in another place”, and occasionally “yeah it was helpful somewhere&quot;

So workers are reporting “yeah, AI makes me more productive” up the management chain because that makes rewards flow back down the management chain.   Which makes CEO’s think “this shit works!”, I mean it is exacerbates the problem of upper management job being the kind of thing AI can do anyway, of taking in a ton of data and making choices without understanding what the fuck is really going on anyway, so CEO’s already see AI “working” and they are inclined to believe it, especially when their whole management chain reports it as working...

&quot;So letâ(TM)s say you work at a company, and they have an OKR &#39;use AI to improve productivity&#39;. If you arenâ(TM)t familiar with OKRs, they are something that your manager tells you to do, and the more of them you do the more likely you are to get a raise, or bonus, or at least keep your job. Sometimes they are flat out assigned to you, sometimes you get to pick off a list, sometimes you and your manager come up with them together. You manager likely has an OKR handed down to them to get their empl

My fear is that we are in a sort of interstitial bubble with this stuff.  Right now, we have smart people who can possibly use these tools to save some time.  As you say, take 15 minutes to generate and spend an hour correcting errors, vs taking 3 hours to do the thing by hand.

But what happens a few years from now when people who have the ability to spot those errors are &quot;left behind&quot; and there isn&#39;t anyone left to realize what the thing gave you is slop?  I keep seeing it over and over where people are jus

My director is extremely excited about how much time AI saves him writing up his weekly summaries to pass up the chain. He can write a single sentence, pass it to the AI to be written up into a big fancy report, the next guy up the chain uses another AI to decipher the big fancy report into a single sentence summary that may, or may not, be vaguely like the original sentence used to prompt the AI that wrote the big fancy report, and both of them are super pumped that they saved so much time. My director saved writing time, his next-up-the-chain saved the time of having to read what my director wrote. They&#39;ve just used a bit more compute to avoid typing and reading things that were, at best, busywork created to make it seem as if they were involved in the process of what happens beneath them. AI can really help with busywork reporting.

I&#39;m guessing neither of them will realize they&#39;re automating away the entire reason their jobs exist.

That&#39;s an excellent comment - sorry, it was not recognized enough. :-)

But we will always need the CEO position in companies. To satisfy the requirements of the Dilbert Principle [wikipedia.org].

Also, one must have meat-sack leadership to give credibility to judicial sentences like prison. You can&#39;t instill a sense of fear (or deterrence) in an AI. Since once thrown in prison, all one has to do is spin up another copy in the free world.

Early adopters of immature tech rarely have a smooth transition.There will be a lot of confusion and wasted time as workers try to figure out how to use the tools and fix the mistakes the tools make.This gets worse because the tools are rapidly evolving.Changing a complex system is hard, slow and expensive.

This gets worse because the tools are rapidly evolving.Too rapidly. Of course, this is necessary to give the hucksters time to skip town.

How beautiful are our Emperor&#39;s new clothes!

The U.S. may have moved on to another immigration crisis, but Mahmoud Khalil, the Columbia University graduate student who was arrested last spring after participating in pro-Palestine protests, is still in the middle of his legal battle. Khalil was taken into custody in March, after Secretary of State Marco Rubio invoked a rarely used mechanism in federal immigration law that claimed that the student’s actions would have “potentially serious adverse foreign policy consequences for the United States.” The 30-year-old green-card holder was detained for three months, missing the birth of his first child, but was released in June. Last week, the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals issued a devastating blow to Khalil’s case: A three-judge panel dismissed his habeas corpus petition challenging the federal government’s attempts to detain and deport him.

In a 2–1 decision, the court ruled that the lower district court of New Jersey—which had ordered Khalil to be released from immigration detention in June—did not have jurisdiction to consider his habeas petition. The panel’s majority declared that these petitions challenging a final order of removal can be heard only in immigration court, a system overseen by the attorney general, who also handpicks immigration judges.

Khalil essentially has one option left before being forced to go through immigration court: request a rehearing en banc. If that is approved, all 14 judges on the 3rd Circuit would hear Khalil’s case. But not only does the current makeup of this particular court lean conservative; it received a notable new member last year—Emil Bove. A former defense attorney for President Donald Trump and the former deputy attorney general, Bove has been mired in controversy throughout his tenure in the second Trump administration.

To make sense of Khalil’s options, I spoke with Elora Mukherjee. A professor at Columbia Law School and director of the school’s Immigrants’ Rights Clinic, Mukherjee submitted an amicus brief in defense of Khalil, along with other students, scholars, and professors who have been charged under the same foreign-policy deportability ground that Khalil currently faces. Our conversation has been edited and condensed for clarity.

Shirin Ali: Before we get into the 3rd Circuit’s latest opinion, can you bring us up to speed on how exactly Khalil’s case ended up there?

Elora Mukherjee: On the night that Khalil was wrongly arrested, detained, and targeted for his speech—peaceful speech that should be protected by the First Amendment—he was initially detained at his apartment in graduate student housing at Columbia University. That night, his lawyers immediately filed a federal habeas petition for him with the Southern District of New York.

But by the time that petition was formally filed in federal court, Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents had already transferred Khalil to a detention center in northern New Jersey. For that reason, the initial federal judge assigned to Khalil’s case in SDNY found that he didn’t have jurisdiction to hear the habeas petition. Instead, he transferred it to the New Jersey federal district court. That transfer was done over the objection of the federal government, which argued that because Khalil was detained in Louisiana, the case should be either dismissed outright or transferred to the federal district court for the Western District of Louisiana.

The federal government again tried to get Khalil’s case transferred to Louisiana by filing a motion with the New Jersey district court but was denied. Eventually, the question [of who should hear the case] landed with the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.

And what do you make of the circuit court’s latest opinion?

The decision is wrong. It was a split decision with two judges in the majority and one judge in the dissent. Judges Thomas Hardiman and Stephanos Bibas were in the majority—President George W. Bush appointed Hardiman, and Trump appointed Bibas during his first term. The majority interprets provisions of immigration law that were introduced with the 1996 Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act as stripping federal courts of jurisdiction to hear the constitutional claims of individuals like Khalil, who are alleging that their rights are being irreparably harmed.

According to these two judges, Khalil is not eligible to file a federal habeas petition. The only recourse available to him is to raise any defenses that he has, first in his immigration court proceedings before the Board of Immigration Appeals, then to the federal circuit court that has jurisdiction over the immigration court that initially heard his removal proceedings—in this case, the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals.

This is exactly what the Trump administration wants. The government has claimed that the jurisdiction stripping provisions of the IIRAIRA are broad in cases over the years, but that position has consistently been rejected in federal courts—including, most recently, in the U.S. Supreme Court, in Jennings v. Rodriguez, a case from 2018. In the Jennings case and in similar cases, the Supreme Court and other federal courts have consistently affirmed that federal courts have jurisdiction to hear habeas claims.

If the right to habeas corpus is enshrined in the U.S. Constitution, how can the 3rd Circuit essentially take that away from Khalil?

This is what much of this litigation has been about. The Trump administration’s position is that there should be only one proceeding, and the only proceeding that Khalil is entitled to contest is in Louisiana immigration court. Once he loses in immigration court, he can appeal that to the Board of Immigration Appeals. Once he loses at the BIA, he can appeal that to the relevant federal circuit court, which for him, the administration would argue, is the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals. That would be the administration’s position because Khalil was detained for the longest period of time in the Western District of Louisiana, and Louisiana is where the immigration judge issued the removal order against him.

In my view, and the position of reasonable people across party lines who care about the rule of law, is that federal habeas proceedings must be available to individuals who are targeted by the executive branch in violation of basic constitutional protections. There is a doctrine that allows for people to go to federal court and file habeas petitions when their constitutional rights have been violated, and it doesn’t require waiting months or years to first exhaust the immigration court proceedings, waiting again for the BIA to rule, and finally getting to a federal circuit court of appeals. By that point in time, Khalil could have been detained for months or years, during which time he would have suffered irreparable harm because of the Trump administration’s violation of his First Amendment rights.

The quick summary of this doctrine is this: If a person is suffering irreparable harm affecting their constitutional rights, then they should be able to seek relief through federal habeas court proceedings without first needing to wait months or years for their immigration proceedings to be exhausted.

Can Khalil appeal the 3rd Circuit’s decision? What options does he have now?

He can request a rehearing en banc with the 3rd Circuit, which is an opportunity for all the judges on the court to rehear his case. The full en banc panel could request a new briefing on these issues from both sides, asking what they think about the panel decision that was issued last week, and it would be extremely likely to have oral arguments. All the judges on the court would have a chance to weigh in on the en banc court’s final opinion, or opinions, as there would likely be a split decision from the 3rd Circuit, given the makeup of that court.

Through the Biden administration, the 3rd Circuit was considered a swing court, in that its makeup was about half appointees from Democratic presidents and about half appointees by Republican presidents. In the last year or so of the Biden administration, there was an opportunity to appoint a judge to the circuit that would result in the court being composed of a slight majority of federal judges appointed by Democratic presidents. Unfortunately, as the Biden administration ended, it left a vacant seat on the 3rd Circuit, and last year that seat was filled by Emil Bove.

If the en banc’s majority also ends up ruling against Khalil, at that point he would have the option of appealing to the U.S. Supreme Court. If the Supreme Court grants cert in Khalil’s case and issues an opinion, it would likely have consequences for other noncitizen students and scholars who have spoken out against the Trump administration. It also could have broader consequences for noncitizens who are trying to seek habeas relief after they have been wrongly arrested and detained by the executive branch.

While this case has been unfolding, Khalil has had a separate legal challenge active in Louisiana’s immigration court. What’s going on with that one?

This is very confusing, because there are multiple proceedings taking place simultaneously. So there is a proceeding in immigration court in Louisiana, and that is taking place before an agency called the Executive Office for Immigration Review. It’s housed within the Department of Justice and is presided over by an immigration judge. This is one track that was proceeding at the same time the federal habeas proceedings were going forward in the District of New Jersey.

My understanding is that his case is currently pending before the Board of Immigration Appeals. I don’t know what the briefing schedule is, but it’s worth mentioning that over the past year the Trump administration has fired or reassigned all the reasonable members of the BIA. In 2025, I believe, with one exception, dozens and dozens of cases and opinions issued by the board almost uniformly narrowed the protections available to noncitizens. So there are real questions about whether the BIA is still a meaningful administrative appellate body.

Immigration judges here are also hired by the attorney general, but over the past year, more than 100 immigration judges who didn’t toe the administration’s party line have been fired—they don’t have any of the protections, such as life tenure, that one expects of federal judges. And in hiring announcements for what has historically been called immigration judges, the administration is now calling them deportation judges. The Trump administration is very clear about what it wants these administrative law officers to do. Lastly, the federal district court in the Western District of Louisiana has, the last time I checked, the lowest grant rate for federal habeas petitions in the country. Plus, the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals is known for being the least likely federal appeals court to protect people’s civil rights.

Five years ago, and to his enduring credit, Louisiana Sen. Bill Cassidy voted to convict Donald Trump on an impeachment charge of “incitement of insurrection.” In a brief statement afterward, Cassidy said, “I voted to convict Trump because he is guilty.”

Cassidy, representing a deep-red state and at the time still ascending toward a committee chairmanship and a meaningful tenure in the Senate, had the most to lose politically of the seven Republicans who voted to convict Trump. He had, however, just won reelection in 2020. He may have bet that Trump would simply disappear into the shadows of American political life before Cassidy had to stand before voters again.

As we are all more aware with each passing minute, that bet was wrong. And lest anyone think that Trump might forgive something like an impeachment vote against him, he quashed that over the weekend when he prospectively endorsed GOP Rep. Julia Letlow in a primary against Cassidy, urging, “RUN, JULIA, RUN!!!,” on his social media account.

Letlow announced her candidacy Tuesday morning. The key lines of her launch video, which features a great many photos of Trump, or of herself with Trump: “A state as conservative as ours? We shouldn’t have to wonder how our senator will vote when the pressure is on.”

Cassidy, in a statement Tuesday, said that Letlow had called him before her announcement and “said she respected me and that I had done a good job.”

He added, “I will continue to do a good job when I win re-election.”

His confidence may not be well placed. Cassidy, who entered the Senate in 2015, was censured by his party following his Trump conviction vote. A Trump endorsement in a GOP primary, in a very red state, means the world, and Letlow is not a gadfly candidate. If Cassidy still wants to have a meaningful tenure in the Senate, he should treat this year as his last. Because there’s a great chance it is.

The senator, who also failed to endorse Trump in 2024, has since done everything he can to win the president’s favor—or at least his indifference. That included absorbing oceans of criticism for his role in supporting one of Trump’s key nominees with whom Cassidy was plainly uncomfortable. Trump must have enjoyed watching him twist in the wind this way for the past year just as much as he enjoys turning on those just as they get their hopes up that he won’t. It’s another warning to anyone who ever might think they’re safe from a change in Trump’s mood.

Those familiar with his campaign-rally routines will know Trump’s many recitations of “The Snake,” something he refers to as a poem but is really a song from the 1960s. The lyrics are about a woman who takes a snake into her home and is then bit by it, to which the snake says, “You knew damn well I was a snake before you took me in.” Trump has long used this as a metaphor against lax immigration policies, while everyone else observes that it’s a form of projection and a warning to those who put their trust in Trump.

Cassidy seemed to believe that he could get over the hurdle with Trump in the first year of Trump’s second presidency and at least win his neutrality in a GOP Senate primary. Most notably, Cassidy, despite being a physician who was visibly disgusted with vaccine conspiracy theorist Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s nomination to head the Department of Health and Human Services, cast the key vote to confirm Kennedy in the Senate Finance Committee last year. Cassidy did so after receiving a variety of “assurances” from Kennedy that he wouldn’t make all sorts of ruptures to mainstream public health, which Kennedy has gone on to do anyway.

And while Cassidy has been more and more critical of Kennedy over the past year—to no apparent avail—he’s otherwise moved in lockstep with Trump. The pinned posts on both his official and personal X accounts show him beside the president in the Oval Office as Trump signs a MAGA hat for him. You will not see him entertaining defecting Trump on any floor votes or criticizing episodes of executive imperialism. Even for the one issue on which he has spent some capital—criticizing Kennedy—he does it by trying to drive a wedge between Kennedy and Trump. He noted in a September hearing with Kennedy, for instance, that Kennedy has been sharply critical of COVID vaccines, whereas Trump should win the Nobel Peace Prize for his role in their development.

On a surface level, Cassidy’s sucking up appeared to be paying dividends. Months came and went without Trump endorsing an opponent. Politico asserted, first in an article in September, that things were “looking up” for Cassidy and again, just last week, that Trump was not expected to make an endorsement in either the Louisiana or Texas GOP Senate primaries.

This may have all been a ruse to get through the peak governing season in Trump’s first two years, as the president needed Cassidy as an ally on major nominations and legislation. The New York Times reported over the weekend that Trump first met with Letlow last March and told her that she would have his support if she challenged Cassidy. “But,” the Times added, “he said he would have to lie low for the time being to avoid a repeat of Mr. Trump’s clashes with former Senator Mitt Romney of Utah, who routinely broke with the president, including on his vote to remove him from office.”

Cassidy gave the suck-up routine the old college try, but ultimately, the snake did its snake thing. Cassidy now has the choice to either try to out-Trump the Trump-endorsed candidate in the race or accept Trump’s rationale in endorsing Letlow—now that he doesn’t need Cassidy’s help in Congress anymore—and stop offering it.

Cassidy ought to take a look at North Carolina’s Thom Tillis, one of his fellow GOP senators from the 2015 freshman class, and note how much more enlivened and central to the discussion he is now that he’s unshackled from electoral considerations. The country is in a dangerous place right now. The Senate could use another adult voice.

The Supreme Court heard arguments over state-level bans on trans athletes competing in public schools last week. Though it’s hard to imagine the conservative-majority court calling the bans “discriminatory,” trans athletes and allies have reason to hope for a narrow ruling, rather than an expansion of the existing laws.

Over the past week, the Trump administration has escalated its attacks on Minnesota officials and protesters who oppose its immigration crackdown in the Twin Cities. Federal officials have claimed that Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey are terrorists, and lobbed the same charge against slain protester Renee Good. Donald Trump’s Justice Department has also opened an investigation into Walz and Frey, issuing subpoenas to Democratic officials on Tuesday. The expanding probe appears to lay the groundwork for potential criminal charges against both men for obstructing federal immigration enforcement. It follows Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche’s declaration last week that Walz and Frey are engaged in outright “terrorism,” promising to stop it “by any means necessary.”

On this week’s episode of Amicus, Mark Joseph Stern spoke with Julia Gegenheimer about the rapidly expanding definition of terrorism, obstruction, and other charges that the government is weaponizing against political opponents. Gegenheimer is special litigation counsel at Georgetown Law’s Institute for Constitutional Advocacy and Protection and previously served at the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division. An excerpt from their conversation, below, has been edited for length and clarity.

Mark Joseph Stern: You spent years working on cases involving domestic terrorism and extremist violence. Is this what happens when almost anyone can be classified as a “terrorist” and any opposition to the government, including protected First Amendment activities, can be classified as “terrorism”?

Julia Gegenheimer: I think it’s important here, when we talk about domestic terrorism, to take a step back and look at what we actually mean when we use that term. It’s being thrown around a lot in common parlance to stand in for people who are opposed to this administration or its policies, or who are protesting this administration, or who seek to hold it accountable. But federal law actually defines domestic terrorism. Under the law, domestic terrorism involves activities that are “dangerous to human life,” that are in violation of federal criminal law—and, on top of that, have the intent to intimidate a population, or to affect the “conduct” or “policy” of a government by “intimidation or coercion.”

Even then, domestic terrorism is not itself a federal crime. You have to have an underlying federal criminal violation, then these additional layers of motivation or intent stack on top of it. So the impact of throwing this term around very loosely is to threaten criminal punishment for conduct that falls far, far short of what federal law would actually look at as domestic terrorism.

We’ve seen the president and his allies calling these protesters “terrorists.” We’ve seen the government treating protesters like Renee Good much as they treated the fishermen in international waters, whom they bombed without any semblance of due process. It feels to me like an escalation to then accuse elected local and state leaders of terrorism.

It is profoundly disturbing. And the reason why this feels different to you is that it is a bit of a different flavor. It’s pitting the federal government against the states and creating tension where it doesn’t need to be. And frankly, it’s implicitly encouraging acts of political violence against these elected officials by turning them into the enemy.

So we have the Trump administration falsely accusing state and local leaders of encouraging political violence—and, in the process, actually encouraging political violence against the people they’re defaming.

Sure. We’ve seen this throughout history, even recent history: When you put people in opposition like that—when you portray them as the enemy, when you describe them as kind of threatening a person’s way of life or things that they hold dear—that creates the conditions under which people are more likely to resort to political violence, and it becomes more and more the norm.

It feels very much of a piece with the Trump administration treating blue states as the enemy of the federal government and even the American people. The administration is shutting off federal funds to blue states, canceling projects within blue states, trying to suppress the votes of blue state residents. It’s direct hostility and antagonism toward the half of the country that didn’t vote for Trump. It’s also a refusal to acknowledge the legitimacy of whom those people did vote for, including Tim Walz.

It seems to me that it leads to a really dark place when the federal government can almost declare war on a state because it didn’t go for him in the most recent election. Then occupy that state with federal agents who are actively hostile and in fact violent toward the local community.

Officials in this administration have been explicit that they are targeting blue states. We’ve seen the surges in Minnesota, Chicago, and Washington, D.C. The reasoning behind that has been that these are traditionally blue states or Democratic areas. It doesn’t take too much reading between the lines to see that that’s what’s going on.

In his address to Minnesotans, Gov. Tim Walz urged residents to bear witness and help to create a record. That record, of course, will be vital in prosecutions, should they ever happen. But at the same time, the Trump administration is telling citizens that following or recording ICE officers is a federal crime and maybe even domestic terrorism. That it’s an obstruction of law enforcement to follow federal agents and to document what they are doing. Is that true?

No. The act of observing and recording officers from a safe distance, including when they are making an arrest, is something that has been long- and well-recognized as protected by the First Amendment.

Could you explain why? There’s a wrinkle here because smartphones are 21st-century technology that the Framers couldn’t possibly have conceived of. But it does seem like this is bedrock First Amendment stuff, right? The First Amendment isn’t just billionaires buying an election. I would think that in a democracy, regular people have a right, if not a duty, to document what public officials are doing on the job, very much including armed agents of the state. Is that something the law bears out?

Yes. Cellphone recordings of ICE activity connect back to these really fundamental principles that the First Amendment was designed to protect. They’re connected to the idea that people have a right to know what their government is doing so they can express views on what their government is doing and protest peacefully against it.

            <a class="original-link" href="https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2026/01/ice-minnesota-minneapolis-keith-ellison-shooting-protests-violence-lawsuits.html?via=rss">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">All weekend long, the headlines out of Minneapolis have captured a moment that is by turns alarming and bizarre.

For instance, in the wake of the killing of Renee Good by Immigration and Customs Enforcement, protesters have been gathering at a federal building out by the airport in the bitter cold. Police have greeted them with chemical irritants.

Meanwhile, downtown, a pardoned Jan. 6 rioter tried to stage a protest in support of the Trump administration. But his small group was quickly overwhelmed—and pelted with water balloons. Locals blasted music from the movie Frozen and carried signs reading “ICE out of Minnesota.”

Around the time that Jan. 6–er was getting soaked, What Next host Mary Harris hopped on a call with Keith Ellison, the state’s attorney general. On a recent episode of What Next, the two discussed the challenging situation in Minneapolis, why it may take time to bring charges over Good’s killing, and how Ellison is standing up to President Donald Trump. This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.

Mary Harris: I want to talk about what your office has been doing in the wake of the killing of Renee Good. You’re working with a local prosecutor to beseech the public to send you evidence in this case, and evidence more generally of how immigration enforcement is going down in the state of Minnesota?

Keith Ellison: Yeah, two different portals. One is through the Hennepin County attorney’s office for evidence concerning the death of Good, and the other one is just general information on what ICE is doing, what they’re up to. And they’re for two separate reasons. One is going to help us determine whether it would be appropriate to file charges against Jonathan Ross, and that decision has not been made yet. And I don’t want people to worry. It is the practice for criminal investigations to first investigate, then make a charging decision.

It’s been days since Renee Good was killed. Many people have seen the video of her death through multiple angles, multiple different videos. Can you explain to me as a lawyer why the evidence I’ve seen is not sufficient to at least impanel a grand jury to consider charges against the officer who shot her?

The reason is very simple. Evidence is being gathered as quickly as possible. The final autopsy is not even done yet, and it might not be done in the normal course of events yet. But also, the local FBI, under the direction of the federal government, has been told to deny the state access to the car, which includes the windows that could show the trajectory of bullets, the shell casings, and the gun.

Wouldn’t bringing charges mean that you had to have access to that evidence? Maybe a judge would say you have to?

Well, look, you want to have the best case before you file charges. You may still need to do some discovery demands.

You mentioned this other portal, the fact that you’re also seeking information about how immigration enforcement is behaving in general in Minneapolis and in Minnesota. And I have to say that over the past week, I’ve seen so much troubling information coming out of Minneapolis. I’ve seen reports of protestors talking about being thrown in cars, being groped by ICE agents, being called names. There are people being told: “Didn’t you see what happened to that woman?” Are you seeing prosecutable behavior when you see these things?

Yeah—they say it in the most disgusting terms, by the way. It’s not just “Didn’t you see what happened to that woman?” It’s “Didn’t you see what happened to that effing …,” then there’s an expletive about her sexual orientation. It’s just the nastiest, most revolting, insulting way possible. We’ve seen all of that and more.

But one of the challenges we have right now is that prosecutors do not do investigations; police do them. And, quite frankly, it’s simply outside the experience and culture of police to arrest federal agents, because usually federal agents are doing what the statute says they’re supposed to do, reasonably connected to their legal obligation. They might not do it the way you would do it, and they might violate the rights of people. But more or less, they’re doing what the law says to do. Now, this is very different. I mean, you mentioned throwing people in cars. They’re ripping people out of cars too. They’re smashing their windows. They’re throwing smoke bombs and chemical irritants under the car. There was an infant who stopped breathing and needed CPR by the parents. They’ve been at high schools—saturating high schools, terrorizing kids. There’s been a wide range of crazy behavior.

A federal judge just issued an injunction barring ICE agents from retaliating against protesters in Minnesota. I wonder if you think the federal agents will be abiding by that order, and what that order includes.

Well, let me tell you this: It is a good thing that Judge Kate Menendez issued that very thoughtful order. Before we race ahead and say, “Oh my God, this order could have a problem,” let’s just say that the judge considered the evidence and found that the agency was violating people’s rights and she needed to issue an order to protect them.

What have you learned from seeing how the Trump administration and immigration enforcement have operated in other cities before they came to your region? Are there lessons you took from that? Or do you feel that there are critical differences in how the agents are behaving now that they’re in Minneapolis?

There’s both. The caper they pulled in Chicago, where they descended upon the apartment building, where they’re kicking in doors indiscriminately, that was sort of an indication that we’re dealing with people who have absolutely no sense of legality, propriety, or decency. They will harm anyone they want. People analogize it to the Gestapo. And those analogies are very appropriate. We saw that behavior. Me and my fellow attorneys general talk about this stuff all the time. We’ve been in touch. Of course, the Minnesota one is the biggest surge they’ve done, so nobody really could prepare us for what we’ve seen. But talking to the folks from Oregon, they taught us a lot about using humor. You’ll remember the frog suits and stuff like that.

I would say that we’ve learned a lot from our colleagues, but this one has been the biggest and most severe and most aggressive surge. And so, because of that, we are dealing from no playbook here. But we do have a playbook. It’s called the U.S. Constitution, and we’re going to enforce it.

Republicans say they’re going after your state because there’s a big undocumented population (that’s a lie) and that the Somali community has been engaged in fraud, and that fraud has not been taken seriously by the local leaders. What do you say to that?

Well, if Trump wanted to help us deal with fraud, he would have sent us accountants. Instead, he sent us armed paramilitaries wearing masks, kicking in doors, grabbing whoever. Now, how is that rationally related to white-collar-crime reduction? It’s just ridiculous.

Do you think there’s anything leaders in Minnesota could have done to prevent this? Some would say taking the fraud more seriously would have prevented the most aggressive action.

First, we take fraud very seriously. My office has prosecuted over 300 people for Medicaid fraud and convicted them. And some have gone to prison, and they’ve all been held accountable. This is not about fraud. And if Trump was so concerned about fraud, why would he be pardoning fraudsters who have been committing fraud all over the country? He himself has Trump University fraud. He himself has been convicted civilly. He’s had a civil liability for defrauding the assessment of his buildings and in his taxes.

It’s not about fraud. You’re never going to see somebody doing something wicked and evil and bad saying it. It’s never happened in the history of humanity. Even Hitler said, “I was protecting the homeland and my people.” Mussolini had a reason. Franco had a reason. They all have a reason for the wickedness that they do.

If and when the Department of Justice opens an investigation into you, I wonder if you have a game plan.

I got a lawyer. That’s my game plan. Here’s the thing: Your question is a good one, because what wrong was Tish James doing? None. What wrong was James Comey doing? None. It doesn’t matter whether you’ve committed a crime or acted in violation of the law. What matters is if you’ve offended the king.

It doesn’t sound as if you have any problem offending the king.

I would have no problem giving credit where credit is due if any was due. I just haven’t seen any. This is a president who has taken onto himself the power to tax—that’s what a tariff is—which is Congress’ job. He’s taken onto himself the power to spend. He’s taken onto himself the power to adjudicate what the outcome of a particular controversy should be. That’s the judiciary’s job. He is collapsing the functions of the three levels of government into himself. And then the other element of federalism, which is the balance between the state and the central government, he’s trying to convert states into lesser bodies of sovereignty than we are. And so what do we do with that? Stand around and hope for the best? At some point, just trying to be polite isn’t going to work. And there’s no amount of sucking up that’s going to win you favor from this guy.

            <div id="article-text">The European Space Agency (ESA) has unveiled a full-scale structural mock-up of the landing platform for its long-delayed ExoMars Rosalind Franklin rover.

The platform&#39;s four legs must ensure the rover survives its final moments of descent, equipped with shock absorbers and sensors designed to trigger engine shutdown upon touchdown on Mars. Timing is critical: switch them off too soon, and the landing might be harder than planned. Too late, and Martian soil might be blasted into sensitive places.

There is also a risk the whole thing will tip over if the engines are left running too long, or if the lander touches down at an angle or on top of a rock.

&quot;The last thing you want is for the platform to tip over when it reaches the Martian surface. These tests will confirm its stability at landing,&quot; said Benjamin Rasse, ESA&#39;s team leader for the ExoMars descent module.

Teams from Thales Alenia Space and Airbus (which is providing the landing platform) spent more than a month dropping the model onto various surfaces to verify the system works as intended. Next, they&#39;ll drop it onto a moving sledge at higher speeds to simulate angled landings.

The ExoMars team has faced repeated delays due to technical problems, and Russia&#39;s invasion of Ukraine put paid to a 2022 launch. The Russian space agency, Roscosmos, was supposed to provide a launch vehicle and lander for the rover, but cooperation was suspended mere months before the spacecraft was scheduled to travel to the Red Planet. The mission now targets a 2028 launch.

In 2025, Airbus UK won a £150 million contract to complete the rover&#39;s landing system. NASA will contribute the launch vehicle, heater units, and rockets to assist with the landing. The 2028 launch is scheduled from Kennedy Space Center in Florida and is expected to go ahead between October and December. The bot will finally arrive at Mars in 2030.

NASA&#39;s involvement in the project has been turbulent. Originally a partner, the agency withdrew after budget cuts, prompting Roscosmos to join before Russia&#39;s invasion of Ukraine caused a suspension of cooperation. NASA then signed on again in 2024, before the Trump administration proposed slashing the agency&#39;s budget.

In late 2025, ESA boss Josef Aschbacher stated that NASA had confirmed its contribution would go ahead as planned.

The successful tests offer relief to ESA managers but underscore how much work remains before the 2028 launch window. ®

            <h2>We come in peace, OpenAI tells locals near gargantuan Stargate facilities</h2>

            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2026/01/21/stargate_openai_community_plans/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">OpenAI wants every Stargate datacenter campus to come with its own community plan reflecting &quot;local concerns,&quot; including a commitment not to cause a hike in electricity prices, minimizing water use, and protecting local ecosystems.

The Stargate project, launched almost exactly a year ago, aims to spend as much as $500 billion on infrastructure to power AI development over the next several years.

However, datacenter projects have been facing increasing opposition from local communities, especially massive projects such as those at Stargate&#39;s site Abilene, Texas, where ten buildings each covering half a million square feet are being constructed.

Such developments can dominate the landscape, and communities living in their shadow have complained about noise, the amount of water and energy they might consume, and that they tend not to create many long-term local jobs.

Research org Data Center Watch reported that 20 US server farm projects were blocked or delayed amid local opposition during Q2 2025 alone.

In response, OpenAI says it is &quot;committed to working with communities&quot; to ensure its Stargate campuses are built and run in a way that strengthens such communities and &quot;demonstrates that we&#39;re being good neighbors.&quot;

It promises locally-tailored community plans for every campus, driven by input from residents. However, each plan will include a commitment to pay its own way on energy, so that the project&#39;s operations don&#39;t lead to a jump in electricity prices.

Stargate may fund extra generating capacity and grid upgrades, for example, as well as working with power companies on operating AI campuses as flexible loads, so that its facilities can reduce or curtail their consumption during periods of peak demand.

This sounds laudable, but a cynic might point to the fact that President Trump recently declared that tech giants ought to pay their way when it comes to delivering the extra power they need, and Microsoft has already beaten them to it with its announcement of &quot;Community-First AI Infrastructure.&quot;

Another pledge is to minimize water use by prioritizing closed-loop or low-water cooling systems. Many AI server systems run so hot that they need direct-to-chip liquid cooling infrastructure, which requires less water than more traditional methods involving evaporation.

OpenAI also says it will invest in local jobs by establishing OpenAI Academies as the backbone of regional workforce development in communities close to its facilities. However, the Wall Street Journal reported that Stargate&#39;s site in Texas will only have about 100 full-time workers once operational, although many more will be employed during the construction phase.

The firm recently announced it has hired former UK Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne to head up OpenAI for Countries, an initiative to export the company&#39;s Stargate project to other nations beyond the US. ®

            <h2>Palantir CEO claims AI will mean western economies won't need immigration</h2>
            <p><strong>The Register | 2026-01-21</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2026/01/21/palantir_ceo_karp_claims_ai/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Opinion Palantir CEO Alex Karp has an inimitable aptitude for sniffing out the politically sensitive topic about which, by his own admission, he should not be speaking, but which will also win him the most attention.

Last year, it was the idea of innate western superiority and his belief that his company&#39;s software product was &quot;the only reason why someone&#39;s not goose-stepping between me and you&quot; on the streets of Europe.

This week, after promising not to go on one of his &quot;usual political screeds,&quot; the Palantir CEO went off on one, as the Brits like to say, launching into a speculative analysis of the impact of AI on immigration. Two hot topics in one: bingo.

Flying into Davos for the World Economic Forum — or perhaps appearing in a puff of red smoke from under a ghoulish cloak — Karp responded to probing about the impact of AI on the jobs market.

&quot;I do think these trends [in AI] really do make it hard to imagine why we should have large-scale immigration unless you have a very specialized skill,&quot; he said.

He was unlikely to have his worldview significantly challenged by his interviewer, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink, the septuagenarian billionaire Co-Chairman of the World Economic Forum.

And so it proved, with Fink gliding past the notion that many immigrants fulfil roles in health, construction, or service industry jobs that western nations find hard to fill, and focusing on the important point for attendees: the impact on white-collar jobs.

The point is not without merit: 4.7 million non-US-born workers fulfil professional and business services roles, for example.

During the World Economic Forum session, Karp agreed that AI would lead to fewer white collar jobs. But went on to say that organizations &quot;need different ways of testing aptitude.&quot;

&quot;There are a lot of people doing X that should be doing Y,&quot; he said, adding that one of his main tasks at the US-based spy-tech company was &quot;walking around figuring out what is someone&#39;s outlier aptitude.&quot;

Outside the febrile atmosphere of the WEF Annual Meeting, skeptics on the actual benefits of AI are becoming more commonplace.

Yesterday, Deutsche Bank analysts Adrian Cox and Stefan Abrudan published a note declaring the &quot;the honeymoon is over&quot; for AI. The AI market will be hit by disillusionment, dislocation, and distrust, they said. &quot;This matters as AI investment and optimism are buoying the global economy, accounting for most of economic and earnings growth in the US last year,&quot; they said, suggesting the consequences should the AI boom go into reverse.

The sentiment echoed earlier comments from Gartner, which said enterprise adoption of AI was in the so-called &quot;trough of disillusionment,&quot; while investment from AI, cloud, and software companies was still sky-rocketing. Meanwhile, the majority of CEOs are reporting zero pay-offs from AI investments, according to PwC.

Karp admitted AI is a &quot;very low-trust environment,&quot; which is why Palantir needs very few salespeople.

In the case of building AI systems, he said, &quot;people have tried lots of stuff. A lot of it hasn&#39;t worked. But if [like Palantir] you&#39;ve delivered stuff that does work, why do you need a salesforce?&quot;

Of course, in the conversation about AI and the future of work in the western world, Karp found room to claim Palantir&#39;s enterprise projects can save &quot;80 percent of your cost and improve your top line dramatically.&quot;

Perhaps the question is really, when you have Alex Karp, why do you need a salesforce? He admitted he got pressure from inside Palantir saying he &quot;should stop speaking in public,&quot; but that&#39;s all part of the schtick. Because, notwithstanding the chronic verbal diarrhea, his outlier aptitude is undoubtedly making himself and his company the center of attention. It&#39;s a shame we will all smell the consequences when the winds change. ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Have I Been Pwned (HIBP) says 72.7 million accounts registered with Under Armour were affected by an alleged ransomware attack in November.

The data breach platform ingested the files that were leaked by a member of the Everest ransomware group on January 18 via a cybercrime forum.

According to HIBP&#39;s post from Tuesday, names, email addresses, dates of birth, genders, geographic locations, and details of previous purchases were leaked.

The athletic apparel giant has not yet acknowledged the alleged leak. It didn&#39;t respond to our questions when we asked about the attack in November and has yet to respond to our latest calls for comment.

Claims of a ransomware attack emerged when Everest added Under Armour to its leak site two months ago, threatening to release stolen data unless the company paid an undisclosed ransom within seven days.

In addition to the data types HIBP confirmed were involved, Everest claimed that phone numbers, physical addresses, loyalty program details, and preferred stores were also included.

Law firm Chimicles Schwartz Kriner & Donaldson-Smith filed a proposed class action lawsuit on behalf of Under Armour customer Orvin Ganesh soon after Everest posted the first details of its claimed attack.

Among the ransomware crew&#39;s back catalog of high-profile raids are claimed hits on Collins Aerospace, Sweden&#39;s power grid, and the Brazilian government, among others.

Asus also recently confirmed it was affected by an Everest attack, albeit through a supplier, with its internal files compromised by the group as a result.

As far as ransomware groups are concerned, Everest is something of a veteran, operating since 2020 – far longer than most groups tend to last, be it through takedowns or implosions.

Despite its long-running impression on the ransomware market and portfolio of high-profile attacks, Reg readers will not find Everest in any of the rankings of most dangerous or most prolific groups.

According to Halcyon, Everest has three distinct revenue streams: double extortion ransomware, network access brokerage, and an insider recruitment program.

These each allow Everest to generate cash through different means, all while drawing less attention than some of the louder ransomware crims. ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">It is 50 years since Concorde began scheduled passenger flights, with British Airways operating a London-Bahrain service and Air France flying from Paris to Rio de Janeiro.

Technically, the Soviet Tupolev Tu-144 was the first supersonic passenger airliner, entering service on December 26, 1975. However, Concorde began scheduled passenger service earlier, on January 21, 1976, while the Tu-144&#39;s passenger flights didn&#39;t start until 1977.

Concorde could fly at more than twice the speed of sound, yet the lucrative transatlantic routes to the US were not viable, casting more doubt on the aircraft&#39;s already ropy economics. Concerns about noise meant it was banned from landing in the US until later in 1976, with operations permitted in New York from 1977.

The first scheduled flight took off amid technical, political, and financial obstacles. It was clear that while Concorde was an impressive technological feat, the economics did not make sense given slower aircraft like Boeing&#39;s 747 could carry far more passengers. Other factors such as the 1973 oil crisis shifted opinion away from the Concorde toward more fuel-efficient options.

By 1976, only British Airways and Air France remained customers for the aircraft, and the production line was winding down. The final Concorde that was manufactured first flew in 1979.

In May 2003, Air France flew its last commercial flight, and British Airways retired its Concorde fleet on October 24, 2003.

Multiple factors contributed to the retirement of the fleet: one of the aircraft crashed during take-off from Charles de Gaulle Airport in Paris on July 25, 2000 and operators cited low passenger numbers after the crash; a broader slump in air travel following the September 11 terror attacks in 2001; and Airbus&#39;s decision to halt the supply of replacement parts.

Many of the remaining Concordes are on display, and we highly recommend a trip to the Sinsheim museum in Germany, where an Air France Concorde and a Tupolev Tu-144 are accessible to visitors.

As for whether Concorde could have kept flying past 2003, it&#39;s possible. The flight rate meant the airframe was still in good condition at the time of retirement. Despite expressions of interest from Richard Branson, who sought to keep the fleet operational, the aircraft were ultimately withdrawn from service.

Concorde entered service just as confidence in mass supersonic travel was already fading. Despite decades of interest in reviving the idea, no successor has yet made it back into commercial service. ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The European Commission (EC) wants a revised Cybersecurity Act to address any threats posed by IT and telecoms kit from third-country sources, potentially forcing member states to confront the thorny issue of suppliers such Huawei in their national networks.

Europe faces increasingly sophisticated hybrid attacks on every area of its infrastructure, the EC claims. The revised Cybersecurity Act looks to address this with union-level risk assessments, combined with targeted mitigation measures that will include bans on IT components from &quot;high-risk suppliers.&quot;

The suggested timeframe for this could leave member states with as little as three years to remove non-compliant kit.

This is seen as the Commission finally cracking down on member states that have for years declined to take any kind of action against suppliers deemed to be a potential security risk, and imposing Europe-wide rules regarding which companies and products should not be trusted.

In mid-2023, former European Commissioner Thierry Breton said telecoms equipment from firms including Huawei and ZTE should be banned throughout the EU amid fears the tech could contain backdors, allowing Beijing to remotely access it for espionage purposes or to disrupt networks. Plan were announced to remove the gear from the Commission&#39;s internal networks.

In the same year it emerged that Huawei had supplied nearly 60 percent of the telco equipment used in Germany&#39;s 5G networks. The megacorp hit back after EU officials labelled it as a &quot;high-risk supplier.&quot;

Huawei has always strongly denied its products represent a security threat, although critics counter that Chinese law requires its citizens and organizations to serve as covert operatives on behalf of the state if ordered to do so.

The EC wants several key things baked into the revised Cybersecurity Act: a framework to address the supply chain security challenges in critical infrastructure, and to simplify the Europe-wide cybersecurity certification framework.

It also wants to strengthen the European Union Agency for Cybersecurity (ENISA), and reduce &quot;unnecessary administrative burdens&quot; relating to implementation of the NIS2 cybersecurity directive (only two member states met the deadline to transpose it into national law.)

As for 5G networks, the EC says the legislation &quot;provides for a phase-out of high-risk suppliers from mobile networks,&quot; and will mean that conformity assessment bodies will not be allowed to certify products or services from these suppliers.

This isn&#39;t just about telecoms, the new Cybersecurity Act along with the upcoming Cloud and AI development act (CADA) will address sovereignty aspects and non-technical risks, according to the EC.

The proposed legislation makes no mention of specific companies such as Huawei, but the China-based tech biz has supplied infrastructure to telecoms networks in pretty much every EU country because it was an early investor in 5G technology and standards.

A spokesperson for Huawei told The Register: &quot;A legislative proposal to limit or exclude non-EU suppliers based on country of origin, rather than factual evidence and technical standards, violates the EU&#39;s basic legal principles of fairness, non-discrimination, and proportionality, as well as its WTO obligations.

&quot;We will closely monitor the subsequent development of the legislative process and reserve all rights to safeguard our legitimate interests.&quot;

Huawei said it will continue to provide products and services as a legally operating company in Europe.

The proposed Cybersecurity Act says that a timeframe for phasing out components provided by high-risk suppliers from communications networks &quot;shall not exceed 36 months from the publication of the list of high-risk suppliers.&quot;

This seems ambitious and compliance is not certain. The UK, for example, mandated in 2020 for the removal of Huawei technology from the country&#39;s 5G networks by the end of 2027. BT, the former state-owned telecoms giant, admitted in 2024 it had missed the 2023 deadline for removing Huawei kit from its network core.

Britain&#39;s decision to rip and replace Huawei kit was also cited as a factor in why UK mobile networks are ranked among the worst in Europe for quality of service, as this diverted cash from being spent on expanding and improving the country&#39;s 5G networks.

Gary Barlet, Public Sector CTO at cybersecurity biz Illumio, warned the EC&#39;s latest move could also lead to fragmentation in the global telecoms ecosystem.

&quot;While efforts to achieve tech sovereignty and protect critical environments are understandable, an overly isolationist approach could create challenges,&quot; Barlet told The Register. &quot;Fragmentation often limits collaboration and slows innovation, making it harder to build robust, future-ready networks.&quot; ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The EX60 is a crossover SUV, which is the best-selling segment right now. And while its design looks familiar, the tech inside is a big upgrade.

The EX60 is a crossover SUV, which is the best-selling segment right now. And while its design looks familiar, the tech inside is a big upgrade.

Volvo’s EX60, with fast-charging capabilities and a brand-new electric architecture, made its official debut today, with the Swedish automaker positioning the crossover EV as a new direction for its battery-powered lineup. With up to 400 miles of estimated range and an 800-volt architecture for ultra-fast charging, the EX60 feels like a concerted effort by Volvo to address some of the most common pain points of EV ownership. But it also represents Volvo’s effort to reshuffle its supply chain and production process for a better chance at earning a profit on its EV lineup.

At first glance, the EX60 looks a little familiar, with an exterior design reminiscent of Volvo’s other EVs and hybrids, like the EX90 and XC70. But the new crossover SUV is built on a totally new platform, Volvo’s SPA3 (Scalable Product Architecture 3), which comes with a raft of new capabilities and features that have been absent from the company’s lineup.

SPA3 is designed for modularity, meaning its hardware and software can be continuously improved. It’s also the first vehicle to benefit from Volvo’s new megacasting production process to reduce weight and improve manufacturing efficiency. And it will utilize a structural battery pack, in which the high-voltage cells are actually part of the structural chassis.

But the processing power is arguably the showcase, with Volvo claiming the EX60 is its “most intelligent” car to date. The EX60 is built around HuginCore, Volvo’s state-of-the-art hardware and software system, which brings together the automaker’s in-house technology with features from Google, Nvidia, and Qualcomm. Volvo says the result is a vehicle that’s faster, smarter, and continuously improving through over-the-air updates.

The EX60 will be Volvo’s first car to feature Google’s Gemini as its new AI assistant. The assistant is “deeply integrated” into the vehicle’s operating system, allowing drivers to have “natural and personalized” conversations. And the infotainment system is designed to be highly responsive with zero lag — but of course we’d need to test it ourselves to say for sure.

The 800-volt architecture, a first for Volvo, also feels like a feature aimed at reducing lag, but this time for charging. Other automakers, like Hyundai and Kia, have stood out amid cooling demand for EVs thanks to their fast-charging, 800-volt-architecture vehicles, and now Volvo wants to do the same. The EX60 can charge from 10–80 percent in 19 minutes, or add 168 miles of range in just 10 minutes, when using a 400kW fast charger. The native NACS charge port will allow EX60 owners to fast-charge at Tesla Supercharger stations.

Volvo is also offering for the first time a global 10-year battery warranty covering up to 240,000km. This extends the company’s previous eight-year coverage and reflects confidence in its in-house battery development and manufacturing capabilities.

The EX60 will have other tricks up its sleeve, too, including vehicle-to-home and vehicle-to-grid functionality as standard across all markets and trims. Volvo has already announced a partnership with Swedish energy provider Vattenfall to explore how the EX60 and other Volvo EVs can help stabilize and balance the grid.

The EX60 will come in three powertrain variants: the P6, with 310 miles of estimate range; the P10, with 320 miles; and the P12, with 400 miles. The P10 and P12 will both come with all-wheel drive for instant torque and improved traction. The P6’s single motor is in the rear wheel, for a lighter, more agile driving experience. With propulsion system will come in either Plus or Ultra trim levels for added comfort. The P6 and P10 will go into production starting April 2026, with the P12 to follow later in the year.

The P10, which Volvo says will start at around $60,000, comes with an impressive array of standard features, including a 21-speaker Bose sound system, 15-inch curved OLED center display with Google built-in, a large panoramic roof, 360-degree camera, 20-inch five-spoke diamond-cut wheels, Pilot Assist driver-assist system, three-zone climate control, metallic paint, active suspension, and a 19.2kW onboard charger.

The EX60 will arrive in a much different world than Volvo would likely prefer. After the flubs associated with the three-row EX90’s launch, the automaker is clearly hoping to recapture some excitement by introducing an new EV in the most popular segment for any vehicle, electric or otherwise: a two-row, five-passenger crossover SUV.

And with an upgraded manufacturing process at Volvo’s historic Torslanda plant in Sweden and the inclusion of megacasting, Volvo is also aiming for a profitable vehicle too. Using this process, the EX60 will have its entire rear underbody cast by an 8,400-ton casting machine, allowing Volvo to replace around 100 separate parts with a single piece of aluminum.

Volvo is calling this its smartest, longest-range, and fastest-charging EV to date — which is noteworthy because those are the superlatives it used to describe the China-made ES90 sedan when it seemed like that EV was next in line for production. Now the ES90 has been delayed thanks to tariffs and concerns about profitability, leaving the EX60 as Volvo’s leading effort to right the ship on EVs.

Six games have been canceled, and Ubisoft is shutting down several studios and restructuring others.

Ubisoft is announcing a major reorganization, and with the changes, it’s refocusing its portfolio and canceling some games, including the beleaguered remake of Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time. With the reorganization, Ubisoft will focus its efforts on big open worlds and live service games.

In the new structure, which goes into effect in April, Ubisoft’s new operating model will “be structured around five Creative Houses,” supported by a “Creative Network providing development resources, shared Core Services and a reshaped HQ.” The brands under each Creative House, which include the studio announced last year dedicated to Assassin’s Creed, Far Cry, and Rainbow Six, will be focused on different genres:

CH1 (Vantage Studios), focused on scaling and extending Ubisoft’s largest and established franchises to turn them into annual billionaire brands;

Brands: Assassin’s Creed, Far Cry, Rainbow Six

CH2 dedicated to competitive and cooperative shooter experiences;

Brands including The Division, Ghost Recon, Splinter Cell

CH3 designed to operate a roster of select, sharp Live experiences;

Brands including For Honor, The Crew, Riders Republic, Brawlhalla, Skull & Bones

CH4 dedicated to immersive fantasy worlds and narrative-driven universes;

Brands including Anno, Might & Magic, Rayman, Prince of Persia, Beyond Good & Evil

CH5 focused on reclaiming position in casual and family-friendly games.

Brands including Just Dance, Idle Miner Tycoon, Ketchapp, Hungry Shark, Invincible: Guarding the Globe, Uno, Hasbro

Ubisoft is also developing four new franchises, including March of Giants, the MOBA Amazon offloaded last year after its own recent gaming reprioritization. Ubisoft is revising its three-year roadmap and has canceled six games with the reorganization, including four unannounced games, three new franchises, a mobile game, and the Sands of Time remake.

“While the project had real potential, we weren’t able to reach the level of quality you deserve, and continuing would have required more time and investment than we could responsibly commit. And, we didn’t want to release something that fell short of what The Sands of Time represents,” according to the Prince of Persia X account. “Prince of Persia as a universe and a legacy continues to matter deeply to us, and this decision does not mean we’re stepping away from the franchise.”

Seven games are being delayed as well, including one unannounced game being pushed from fiscal year 2026 to fiscal year 2027. Ubisoft will bring employees back to the office five days per week, with an “an annual allowance” of work-from-home days.

The company has closed its Halifax mobile studio, its Stockholm studio, and is restructuring its Abu Dhabi, RedLynx and Massive studios.

﻿The Eleven Album is supposed to showcase ‘how artists can use AI to expand their creative range.’

ElevenLabs has released an album of AI-generated songs in its latest attempt to separate itself from the ethical concerns surrounding AI music. The Eleven Album aims to showcase “how artists can use AI to expand their creative range while maintaining full authorship and commercial rights,” according to ElevenLabs.

ElevenLabs is using the album to market its Eleven Music generator and Iconic Voices Marketplace platforms it launched last year, both of which are cleared for commercial use. ElevenLabs says that every artist on the project “produced a fully original track that blends their signature sound with the capabilities of Eleven Music,” and retains full ownership of their work alongside earning 100 percent of any streaming revenue.

The Eleven Album features a mishmash of musical genres and spoken word from 13 artists (which feels like a missed opportunity), including:

You can listen to the album — or to cite ElevenLabs, “experience the future of sound” — on Spotify or the ElevenLabs website.

This comes as music labels have started to shift their perspectives on AI’s place within the industry. After months of fighting with music generators and online platforms over copyright infringement, Universal Music Group (UMG) and Warner Records have forged deals with Suno, Udio, and other AI platforms. Sony Music Entertainment also joined Warner and UMG in inking deals with Klay’s “ethical” AI platform.

ElevenLabs is trying to avoid missing out on those monetization opportunities by appealing to artists directly. Many have voiced strong opposition to having their voice, style, and likeness cloned. Without compensation and ownership rights, those AI clones could impact their ability to make money, given that most people can’t distinguish between AI-generated and human-made music.

            <div id="article-text">The Trump administration is bending the rules to open up the deep sea to commercial mining for the first time.

The Trump administration is bending the rules to open up the deep sea to commercial mining for the first time.

The Trump administration took the next step toward unilaterally jumpstarting deep-sea mining this week, announcing a “consolidated” permitting process for both searching for and commercially extracting minerals that have so far remained relatively untouched.

These minerals are found so deep in the sea that they’re beyond any single nation’s national jurisdiction — which is why President Trump has sparked outrage over his efforts to bypass an international mining code. A chorus of scientists and ocean advocates warn that disturbing the deep seabed could trigger a chain of unforeseen consequences that could eventually harm coastal communities around the world.

Those concerns have been enough to push some companies that might even benefit from a new source of these minerals — coveted for producing rechargeable batteries for electric vehicles, renewable energy, and all kinds of gadgets — to pledge not to use any of the materials sourced from the deep sea. The deep sea is dotted with polymetallic nodules containing nickel, cobalt, manganese, and other minerals used in rechargeable batteries.

Disturbing the deep seabed could trigger a chain of unforeseen consequences

The new rules the Trump administration announced would make it easier for American companies to start harvesting those minerals. Typically, they’d apply first for an exploration license that allows them to start surveying and studying a site. Then, they might move forward with a request for a commercial recovery permit. Now, they’ll be able to apply for both at the same time. It also truncates the environmental review process, since the consolidated application could only require a single environmental impact statement.

The updated rules crafted by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) follow through on an executive order Trump signed last April telling federal agencies to expedite the process for issuing licenses in order to “counter China’s growing influence over seabed mineral resources.”

Other leaders have accused the Trump administration of violating international law by doing so. The International Seabed Authority (ISA), established by the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) says “unilateral exploitation of resources that belong to no single State but to all of humanity is prohibited.”

The Trump administration, on the other hand, claims in a 113-page document published yesterday that the NOAA can “issue licenses and permits to U.S. citizens in areas beyond national jurisdiction” under the 1980 US Deep Seabed Hard Mineral Resources Act. The document also argues that ISA merely regulates deep seabed mining for countries that are parties to the Law of the Sea Convention (LOSC), which the US has not joined.

The ISA has been deadlocked in its attempts at finalizing an official mining code that would govern how any commercial deep-sea mining would proceed. Forty countries have called for a moratorium or ban on deep-sea mining because there’s still so little that humanity understands about the seafloor and the ripple effects that could result from disturbing it. Some car companies and tech companies including Apple and Google have also endorsed a moratorium; solar company Sunrun joined last month.

Nearly 1,000 marine scientists and policy experts have similarly voiced their opposition. Even the surface of the moon is better mapped than the ocean’s abyss, according to NASA. Researchers are also trying to assess whether it’s a source of dark oxygen for life on Earth.

“By fast-tracking mining in unexplored areas of the deep ocean, the Trump administration is practically inviting an environmental disaster,” Emily Jeffers, a senior attorney at the Center for Biological Diversity, said in an emailed statement to The Verge. “Deep-sea mining could change the ocean forever, but Trump officials are basically just rubberstamping the exploitation of these little-understood ecosystems.”

If you want better audio than your phone can deliver while creating content on the go but a high-end wireless mic isn’t in the budget, DJI’s Mic Mini is worth a look. It’ll improve your audio without putting much of a dent in your wallet, especially today now you can buy it with a single mic and two transmitters for $59.99 ($20 off) at Amazon, matching its best price to date.

The Mic Mini is a small wireless microphone designed to deliver clearer, more professional-sounding audio than built-in phone and camera mics. Its receiver plugs directly into a phone, camera, or other devices via USB-C or a standard 3.5mm audio cable, with a Lightning adapter available for older Apple devices and Bluetooth support. DJI also includes a dial on the receiver with five adjustable volume levels, and you can pair two transmitters at once so you can capture audio from up to about 400 meters away when you need more range.

Weighing just 10 grams, the Mic Mini is also comfortable to wear and can be clipped to clothing or worn using a magnetic mount or lanyard so it stays visible on camera. Despite its tiny size, the transmitter lasts up to 11.5 hours on a single charge, though, while the receiver can run for up to 10.5 hours. While you won’t get pro-level features like an onboard screen for monitoring audio levels or built-in backup recording, for casual content creation on the go, the Mic Mini covers the essentials well.

            <div id="article-text">Nex Computer, a company that makes hardware designed to turn your phone into a laptop, is working on something new: the NexPhone. It’s a midrange phone that’s designed to double as your computer and comes with Android and Linux installed, both of which will offer desktop experiences when plugged into a monitor.

But the NexPhone’s best trick is that it can dual-boot into Windows 11, essentially becoming a full Windows PC when hooked up to a display — and also offers a mobile UI that pays tribute to Windows Phone when it’s unplugged. It’s a delightfully geeky attempt to answer the age-old question: Why can’t your smartphone just be your whole dang computer?

This isn’t Nex Computer’s first attempt to make a computer that’s not a computer. The company worked on a concept designed around Intel’s short-lived Compute Card. Currently, it sells the NexDock, a 14-inch laptop shell designed as a dock for phones that run a desktop environment over USB-C, which mainly means Samsung phones at the moment. But Android 16 is bringing that kind of support to more devices, including the NexPhone. Additionally, the NexPhone will offer Linux as an option, which is all the rage right now. It runs as an app on the phone, so you can just straight up use it on the tiny phone screen if you want, which is wild and probably not advisable.

Then there’s the Windows Phone of it all. You need to reboot and start up the phone in Windows mode to use it, and when you do, you’re greeted by a familiar interface. NexDock founder Emre Kosmaz tells me that they had to build a mobile UI using progressive web apps since Microsoft stopped supporting its Windows Subsystem for Android in March 2025.

But mainly, the NexPhone is designed as a little machine to run Windows on a bigger screen when you want it, rather than a Windows Phone revival. Kosmaz demonstrated it connected to a monitor using DisplayLink, but says that once they finishing writing the driver the phone will run it over plain ‘ol USB-C.

The NexPhone uses a Qualcomm QCM6490 chipset designed for IoT applications, which Kosmaz tells me they chose it because of its native support for Android, Linux, and Windows. The phone itself is rugged; meeting the MIL-STD-810H standard and rated both IP68 and IP69 for dust and water resistance. There’s a 5,000mAh battery, a 64-megapixel rear camera, and even wireless charging.

So is this the phone that can finally replace your computer? We won’t know for a while — Nex Computer expects to ship the NexPhone in Q3 of 2026 for $549. The company is taking refundable $199 reservation deposits starting today.

            <h2>Rethinking AI’s future in an augmented workplace</h2>
            <p><strong>MIT Technology Review | 2026-01-21</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2026/01/21/1131366/rethinking-ais-future-in-an-augmented-workplace/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">There are many paths AI evolution could take. On one end of the spectrum, AI is dismissed as a marginal fad, another bubble fueled by notoriety and misallocated capital. On the other end, it’s cast as a dystopian force, destined to eliminate jobs on a large scale and destabilize economies. Markets oscillate between skepticism and the fear of missing out, while the technology itself evolves quickly and investment dollars flow at a rate not seen in decades.

All the while, many of today’s financial and economic thought leaders hold to the consensus that the financial landscape will stay the same as it has been for the last several years. Two years ago, Joseph Davis, global chief economist at Vanguard, and his team felt the same but wanted to develop their perspective on AI technology with a deeper foundation built on history and data. Based on a proprietary data set covering the last 130 years, Davis and his team developed a new framework, The Vanguard Megatrends Model, from research that suggested a more nuanced path than hype extremes: that AI has the potential to be a general purpose technology that lifts productivity, reshapes industries, and augments human work rather than displaces it. In short, AI will be neither marginal nor dystopian.

“Our findings suggest that the continuation of the status quo, the basic expectation of most economists, is actually the least likely outcome,” Davis says. “We project that AI will have an even greater effect on productivity than the personal computer did. And we project that a scenario where AI transforms the economy is far more likely than one where AI disappoints and fiscal deficits dominate. The latter would likely lead to slower economic growth, higher inflation, and increased interest rates.”

Davis does not sugar-coat it, however. Although AI promises economic growth and productivity, it will be disruptive, especially for business leaders and workers in knowledge sectors. “AI is likely to be the most disruptive technology to alter the nature of our work since the personal computer,” says Davis. “Those of a certain age might recall how the broad availability of PCs remade many jobs. It didn’t eliminate jobs as much as it allowed people to focus on higher value activities.”

The team’s framework allowed them to examine AI automation risks to over 800 different occupations. The research indicated that while the potential for job loss exists in upwards of 20% of occupations as a result of AI-driven automation, the majority of jobs—likely four out of five—will result in a mixture of innovation and automation. Workers’ time will increasingly shift to higher value and uniquely human tasks.

This introduces the idea that AI could serve as a copilot to various roles, performing repetitive tasks and generally assisting with responsibilities. Davis argues that traditional economic models often underestimate the potential of AI because they fail to examine the deeper structural effects of technological change. “Most approaches for thinking about future growth, such as GDP, don’t adequately account for AI,” he explains. “They fail to link short-term variations in productivity with the three dimensions of technological change: automation, augmentation, and the emergence of new industries.” Automation enhances worker productivity by handling routine tasks; augmentation allows technology to act as a copilot, amplifying human skills; and the creation of new industries creates new sources of growth.

Ironically, Davis’s research suggests that a reason for the relatively low productivity growth in recent years may be a lack of automation. Despite a decade of rapid innovation in digital and automation technologies, productivity growth has lagged since the 2008 financial crisis, hitting 50-year lows. This appears to support the view that AI’s impact will be marginal. But Davis believes that automation has been adopted in the wrong places. “What surprised me most was how little automation there has been in services like finance, health care, and education,” he says. “Outside of manufacturing, automation has been very limited. That’s been holding back growth for at least two decades.” The services sector accounts for more than 60% of US GDP and 80% of the workforce and has experienced some of the lowest productivity growth. It is here, Davis argues, that AI will make the biggest difference.

One of the biggest challenges facing the economy is demographics, as the Baby Boomer generation retires, immigration slows, and birth rates decline. These demographic headwinds reinforce the need for technological acceleration. “There are concerns about AI being dystopian and causing massive job loss, but we’ll soon have too few workers, not too many,” Davis says. “Economies like the US, Japan, China, and those across Europe will need to step up function in automation as their populations age.”

For example, consider nursing, a profession in which empathy and human presence are irreplaceable. AI has already shown the potential to augment rather than automate in this field, streamlining data entry in electronic health records and helping nurses reclaim time for patient care. Davis estimates that these tools could increase nursing productivity by as much as 20% by 2035, a crucial gain as health-care systems adapt to ageing populations and rising demand. “In our most likely scenario, AI will offset demographic pressures. Within five to seven years, AI’s ability to automate portions of work will be roughly equivalent to adding 16 million to 17 million workers to the US labor force,” Davis says. “That’s essentially the same as if everyone turning 65 over the next five years decided not to retire.” He projects that more than 60% of occupations, including nurses, family physicians, high school teachers, pharmacists, human resource managers, and insurance sales agents, will benefit from AI as an augmentation tool.

As AI technology spreads, the strongest performers in the stock market won’t be its producers, but its users. “That makes sense, because general-purpose technologies enhance productivity, efficiency, and profitability across entire sectors,” says Davis. This adoption of AI is creating flexibility for investment options, which means diversifying beyond technology stocks might be appropriate as reflected in Vanguard’s Economic and Market Outlook for 2026. “As that happens, the benefits move beyond places like Silicon Valley or Boston and into industries that apply the technology in transformative ways.” And history shows that early adopters of new technologies reap the greatest productivity rewards. “We’re clearly in the experimentation phase of learning by doing,” says Davis. “Those companies that encourage and reward experimentation will capture the most value from AI.”

Looking globally, Davis sees the United States and China as significantly ahead in the AI race. “It’s a virtual dead heat,” he says. “That tells me the competition between the two will remain intense.” But other economies, especially those with low automation rates and large service sectors, like Japan, Europe, and Canada, could also see significant benefits. “If AI is truly going to be transformative, three sectors stand out: health care, education, and finance,” says Davis. “For AI to live up to its potential, it must fundamentally reshape these industries, which face high costs and rising demand for better, faster, more personalized services.”

However, Davis says Vanguard is more bullish on AI’s potential to transform the economy than it was just a year ago. Especially since that transformation requires application beyond Silicon Valley. “When I speak to business leaders, I remind them that this transformation hasn’t happened yet,” says Davis. “It’s their investment and innovation that will determine whether it does.”

            <p><strong>MIT Technology Review | 2026-01-21</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2026/01/21/1131513/everyone-wants-ai-sovereignty-no-one-can-truly-have-it/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Governments plan to pour $1.3 trillion into AI infrastructure by 2030 to invest in “sovereign AI,” with the premise being that countries should be in control of their own AI capabilities. The funds include financing for domestic data centers, locally trained models, independent supply chains, and national talent pipelines. This is a response to real shocks: covid-era supply chain breakdowns, rising geopolitical tensions, and the war in Ukraine.

But the pursuit of absolute autonomy is running into reality. AI supply chains are irreducibly global: Chips are designed in the US and manufactured in East Asia; models are trained on data sets drawn from multiple countries; applications are deployed across dozens of jurisdictions.

If sovereignty is to remain meaningful, it must shift from a defensive model of self-reliance to a vision that emphasizes the concept of orchestration, balancing national autonomy with strategic partnership.

Why infrastructure-first strategies hit walls

A November survey by Accenture found that 62% of European organizations are now seeking sovereign AI solutions, driven primarily by geopolitical anxiety rather than technical necessity. That figure rises to 80% in Denmark and 72% in Germany. The European Union has appointed its first Commissioner for Tech Sovereignty.

This year, $475 billion is flowing into AI data centers globally. In the United States, AI data centers accounted for roughly one-fifth of GDP growth in the second quarter of 2025. But the obstacle for other nations hoping to follow suit isn’t just money. It’s energy and physics. Global data center capacity is projected to hit 130 gigawatts by 2030, and for every $1 billion spent on these facilities, $125 million is needed for electricity networks. More than $750 billion in planned investment is already facing grid delays.

And it’s also talent. Researchers and entrepreneurs are mobile, drawn to ecosystems with access to capital, competitive wages, and rapid innovation cycles. Infrastructure alone won’t attract or retain world-class talent.

What nations need isn’t sovereignty through isolation but through specialization and orchestration. This means choosing which capabilities you build, which you pursue through partnership, and where you can genuinely lead in shaping the global AI landscape.

The most successful AI strategies don’t try to replicate Silicon Valley; they identify specific advantages and build partnerships around them.

Singapore offers a model. Rather than seeking to duplicate massive infrastructure, it invested in governance frameworks, digital-identity platforms, and applications of AI in logistics and finance, areas where it can realistically compete.

Israel shows a different path. Its strength lies in a dense network of startups and military-adjacent research institutions delivering outsize influence despite the country’s small size.

South Korea is instructive too. While it has national champions like Samsung and Naver, these firms still partner with Microsoft and Nvidia on infrastructure. That’s deliberate collaboration reflecting strategic oversight, not dependence.

Even China, despite its scale and ambition, cannot secure full-stack autonomy. Its reliance on global research networks and on foreign lithography equipment, such as extreme ultraviolet systems needed to manufacture advanced chips and GPU architectures, shows the limits of techno-nationalism.

The pattern is clear: Nations that specialize and partner strategically can outperform those trying to do everything alone.

Three ways to align ambition with reality

Sovereignty isn’t how many petaflops you own. It’s how many lives you improve and how fast the economy grows. Real sovereignty is the ability to innovate in support of national priorities such as productivity, resilience, and sustainability while maintaining freedom to shape governance and standards.

Nations should track the use of AI in health care and monitor how the technology’s adoption correlates with manufacturing productivity, patent citations, and international research collaborations. The goal is to ensure that AI ecosystems generate inclusive and lasting economic and social value.

2. Cultivate a strong AI innovation ecosystem.

Build infrastructure, but also build the ecosystem around it: research institutions, technical education, entrepreneurship support, and public-private talent development. Infrastructure without skilled talent and vibrant networks cannot deliver a lasting competitive advantage.

Strategic partnerships enable nations to pool resources, lower infrastructure costs, and access complementary expertise. Singapore’s work with global cloud providers and the EU’s collaborative research programs show how nations advance capabilities faster through partnership than through isolation. Rather than competing to set dominant standards, nations should collaborate on interoperable frameworks for transparency, safety, and accountability.

Overinvesting in independence fragments markets and slows cross-border innovation, which is the foundation of AI progress. When strategies focus too narrowly on control, they sacrifice the agility needed to compete.

The cost of getting this wrong isn’t just wasted capital—it’s a decade of falling behind. Nations that double down on infrastructure-first strategies risk ending up with expensive data centers running yesterday’s models, while competitors that choose strategic partnerships iterate faster, attract better talent, and shape the standards that matter.

The winners will be those who define sovereignty not as separation, but as participation plus leadership—choosing who they depend on, where they build, and which global rules they shape. Strategic interdependence may feel less satisfying than independence, but it’s real, it is achievable, and it will separate the leaders from the followers over the next decade.

The age of intelligent systems demands intelligent strategies—ones that measure success not by infrastructure owned, but by problems solved. Nations that embrace this shift won’t just participate in the AI economy; they’ll shape it. That’s sovereignty worth pursuing.

At Davos this year Trump is dominating all the side conversations. There are lots of little jokes. Nervous laughter. Outright anger. Fear in the eyes. It’s wild. The US president is due to speak here today, amid threats of seizing Greenland and fears that he’s about to permanently fracture the NATO alliance.

But Trump isn’t the only game in town—everyone’s also talking about AI. Read Mat’s story to find out more.

A number of startups and university teams that are building “AI scientists” to design and run experiments in the lab, including robot biologists and chemists, have just won extra funding from the UK government agency that funds moonshot R&D.

The competition, set up by ARIA (the Advanced Research and Invention Agency), gives a clear sense of how fast this technology is moving: The agency received 245 proposals from research teams that are already building tools capable of automating increasing amounts of lab work. Read the full story to learn more.

Governments plan to pour $1.3 trillion into AI infrastructure by 2030 to invest in “sovereign AI,” with the premise being that countries should be in control of their own AI capabilities. The funds include financing for domestic data centers, locally trained models, independent supply chains, and national talent pipelines. This is a response to real shocks: covid-era supply chain breakdowns, rising geopolitical tensions, and the war in Ukraine. But the pursuit of absolute autonomy is running into reality: AI supply chains are irreducibly global. If sovereignty is to remain meaningful, it must shift from defensive self-reliance to a vision that balances national autonomy with strategic partnership. Read the full story.

Thanks to genetic science, gene editing, and techniques like cloning, it’s now possible to move DNA through time, studying genetic information in ancient remains and then re-creating it in the bodies of modern beings. And that, scientists say, offers new ways to try to help endangered species, engineer new plants that resist climate change, or even create new human medicines.

Hello from the World Economic Forum annual meeting in Davos, Switzerland. I’ve been here for two days now, attending meetings, speaking on panels, and basically trying to talk to anyone I can. And as far as I can tell, the only things anyone wants to talk about are AI and Trump.

Davos is physically defined by the Congress Center, where the official WEF sessions take place, and the Promenade, a street running through the center of the town lined with various “houses”—mostly retailers that are temporarily converted into meeting hubs for various corporate or national sponsors. So there is a Ukraine House, a Brazil House, Saudi House, and yes, a USA House (more on that tomorrow). There are a handful of media houses from the likes of CNBC and the Wall Street Journal. Some houses are devoted to specific topics; for example, there’s one for science and another for AI.

But like everything else in 2026, the Promenade is dominated by tech companies. At one point I realized that literally everything I could see, in a spot where the road bends a bit, was a tech company house. Palantir, Workday, Infosys, Cloudflare, C3.ai. Maybe this should go without saying, but their presence, both in the houses and on the various stages and parties and platforms here at the World Economic Forum, really drove home to me how utterly and completely tech has captured the global economy.

While the houses host events and serve as networking hubs, the big show is inside the Congress Center. On Tuesday morning, I kicked off my official Davos experience there by moderating a panel with the CEOs of Accenture, Aramco, Royal Philips, and Visa. The topic was scaling up AI within organizations. All of these leaders represented companies that have gone from pilot projects to large internal implementations. It was, for me, a fascinating conversation. You can watch the whole thing here, but my takeaway was that while there are plenty of stories about AI being overhyped (including from us), it is certainly having substantive effects at large companies.

Aramco CEO Amin Nasser, for example, described how that company has found $3 billion to $5 billion in cost savings by improving the efficiency of its operations. Royal Philips CEO Roy Jakobs described how it was allowing health-care practitioners to spend more time with patients by doing things such as automated note-taking. (This really resonated with me, as my wife is a pediatrics nurse, and for decades now I’ve heard her talk about how much of her time is devoted to charting.) And Visa CEO Ryan McInerney talked about his company’s push into agentic commerce and the way that will play out for consumers, small businesses, and the global payments industry.

To elaborate a little on that point, McInerney painted a picture of commerce where agents won’t just shop for things you ask them to, which will be basically step one, but will eventually be able to shop for things based on your preferences and previous spending patterns. This could be your regular grocery shopping, or even a vacation getaway. That’s going to require a lot of trust and authentication to protect both merchants and consumers, but it is clear that the steps into agentic commerce we saw in 2025 were just baby ones. There are much bigger ones coming for 2026. (Coincidentally, I had a discussion with a senior executive from Mastercard on Monday, who made several of the same points.)

But the thing that really resonated with me from the panel was a comment from Accenture CEO Julie Sweet, who has a view not only of her own large org but across a spectrum of companies: “It’s hard to trust something until you understand it.”

I felt that neatly summed up where we are as a society with AI.

Clearly, other people feel the same. Before the official start of the conference I was at AI House for a panel. The place was packed. There was a consistent, massive line to get in, and once inside, I literally had to muscle my way through the crowd. Everyone wanted to get in. Everyone wanted to talk about AI.

(A quick aside on what I was doing there: I sat on a panel called “Creativity and Identity in the Age of Memes and Deepfakes,” led by Atlantic CEO Nicholas Thompson; it featured the artist Emi Kusano, who works with AI, and Duncan Crabtree-Ireland, the chief negotiator for SAG-AFTRA, who has been at the center of a lot of the debates about AI in the film and gaming industries. I’m not going to spend much time describing it because I’m already running long, but it was a rip-roarer of a panel. Check it out.)

The president is due here Wednesday, amid threats of seizing Greenland and fears that he’s about to permanently fracture the NATO alliance. While AI is all over the stages, Trump is dominating all the side conversations. There are lots of little jokes. Nervous laughter. Outright anger. Fear in the eyes. It’s wild.

These conversations are also starting to spill out into the public. Just after my panel on Tuesday, I headed to a pavilion outside the main hall in the Congress Center. I saw someone coming down the stairs with a small entourage, who was suddenly mobbed by cameras and phones.

Moments earlier in the same spot, the press had been surrounding David Beckham, shouting questions at him. So I was primed for it to be another celebrity—after all, captains of industry were everywhere you looked. I mean, I had just bumped into Eric Schmidt, who was literally standing in line in front of me at the coffee bar. Davos is weird.

But in fact, it was Gavin Newsom, the governor of California, who is increasingly seen as the leading voice of the Democratic opposition to President Trump, and a likely contender, or even front-runner, in the race to replace him. Because I live in San Francisco I’ve encountered Newsom many times, dating back to his early days as a city supervisor before he was even mayor. I’ve rarely, rarely, seen him quite so worked up as he was on Tuesday.

Among other things, he called Trump a narcissist who follows “the law of the jungle, the rule of Don” and compared him to a T-Rex, saying, “You mate with him or he devours you.” And he was just as harsh on the world leaders, many of whom are gathered in Davos, calling them “pathetic” and saying he should have brought knee pads for them.

There was more of this sentiment, if in more measured tones, from Canadian prime minister Mark Carney during his address at Davos. While I missed his remarks, they had people talking. “If we’re not at the table, we’re on the menu,” he argued.

Here are our picks for the advances to watch in the years ahead—and why we think they matter right now.

Four ways to think about this year&#39;s reckoning.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The story of enterprise resource planning (ERP) is really a story of businesses learning to organize themselves around the latest, greatest technology of the times. In the 1960s through the ’80s, mainframes, material requirements planning (MRP), and manufacturing resource planning (MRP II) brought core business data from file cabinets to centralized systems. Client-server architectures defined the ’80s and ’90s, taking digitization mainstream during the internet’s infancy. And in the 21st century, as work moved beyond the desktop, SaaS and cloud ushered in flexible access and elastic infrastructure.

The rise of composability and agentic AI marks yet another dawn—and an apt one for the nascent intelligence age. Composable architectures let organizations assemble capabilities from multiple systems in a mix-and-match fashion, so they can swap vendor gridlock for an à la carte portfolio of fit-for-purpose modules. On top of that architectural shift, agentic AI enables coordination across systems that weren’t originally designed to talk to one another.

Early indicators suggest that AI-enabled ERP will yield meaningful performance gains: One 2024 study found that organizations implementing AI-driven ERP solutions stand to gain around a 30% boost in user satisfaction and a 25% lift in productivity; another suggested that AI-driven ERP can lead to processing time savings of up to 45%, as well as improvements in decision accuracy to the tune of 60%.

These dual advancements address long-standing gaps that previous ERP eras fell short of delivering: freedom to innovate outside of vendor roadmaps, capacity for rapid iteration, and true interoperability across all critical functions. This shift signals the end of monolithic dependency as well as a once-in-a-generation opportunity for early movers to gain a competitive edge.

            <div id="article-text">AI agents are moving beyond coding assistants and customer service chatbots into the operational core of the enterprise. The ROI is promising, but autonomy without alignment is a recipe for chaos. Business leaders need to lay the essential foundations now.

Agents are independently handling end-to-end processes across lead generation, supply chain optimization, customer support, and financial reconciliation. A mid-sized organization could easily run 4,000 agents, each making decisions that affect revenue, compliance, and customer experience.

The transformation toward an agent-driven enterprise is inevitable. The economic benefits are too significant to ignore, and the potential is becoming a reality faster than most predicted. The problem? Most businesses and their underlying infrastructure are not prepared for this shift. Early adopters have found unlocking AI initiatives at scale to be extremely challenging.

Companies are investing heavily in AI, but the returns aren&#39;t materializing. According to recent research from Boston Consulting Group, 60% of companies report minimal revenue and cost gains despite substantial investment. However, the leaders reported they achieved five times the revenue increases and three times the cost reductions. Clearly, there is a massive premium for being a leader.

What separates the leaders from the pack isn&#39;t how much they&#39;re spending or which models they&#39;re using. Before scaling AI deployment, these “future-built” companies put critical data infrastructure capabilities in place. They invested in the foundational work that enables AI to function reliably.

To understand how and where enterprise AI can fail, consider four critical quadrants: models, tools, context, and governance.

Take a simple example: an agent that orders you pizza. The model interprets your request (&quot;get me a pizza&quot;). The tool executes the action (calling the Domino&#39;s or Pizza Hut API). Context provides personalization (you tend to order pepperoni on Friday nights at 7pm). Governance validates the outcome (did the pizza actually arrive?).

Each dimension represents a potential failure point:

This framework helps diagnose where reliability gaps emerge. When an enterprise agent fails, which quadrant is the problem? Is the model misunderstanding intent? Are the tools unavailable or broken? Is the context incomplete or contradictory? Or is there no mechanism to verify that the agent did what it was supposed to do?

The temptation is to think that reliability will simply improve as models improve. Yet, model capability is advancing exponentially. The cost of inference has dropped nearly 900 times in three years, hallucination rates are on the decline, and AI’s capacity to perform long tasks doubles every six months.

Tooling is also accelerating. Integration frameworks like the Model Context Protocol (MCP) make it dramatically easier to connect agents with enterprise systems and APIs.

If models are powerful and tools are maturing, then what is holding back adoption?

To borrow from James Carville, “It is the data, stupid.” The root cause of most misbehaving agents is misaligned, inconsistent, or incomplete data.

Enterprises have accumulated data debt over decades. Acquisitions, custom systems, departmental tools, and shadow IT have left data scattered across silos that rarely agree. Support systems do not match what is in marketing systems. Supplier data is duplicated across finance, procurement, and logistics. Locations have multiple representations depending on the source.

Drop a few agents into this environment, and they will perform wonderfully at first, because each one is given a curated set of systems to call. Add more agents and the cracks grow, as each one builds its own fragment of truth.

This dynamic has played out before. When business intelligence became self-serve, everyone started creating dashboards. Productivity soared, reports failed to match. Now imagine that phenomenon not in static dashboards, but in AI agents that can take action. With agents, data inconsistency produces real business consequences, not just debates among departments.

Companies that build unified context and robust governance can deploy thousands of agents with confidence, knowing they&#39;ll work together coherently and comply with business rules. Companies that skip this foundational work will watch their agents produce contradictory results, violate policies, and ultimately erode trust faster than they create value.

The question for enterprises centers on organizational readiness. Will your company prepare the data foundation needed to make agent transformation work? Or will you spend years debugging agents, one issue at a time, forever chasing problems that originate in infrastructure you never built?

Autonomous agents are already transforming how work gets done. But the enterprise will only experience the upside if those systems operate from the same truth. This ensures that when agents reason, plan, and act, they do so based on accurate, consistent, and up-to-date information.

The companies generating value from AI today have built on fit-for-purpose data foundations. They recognized early that in an agentic world, data functions as essential infrastructure. A solid data foundation is what turns experimentation into dependable operations.

At Reltio, the focus is on building that foundation. The Reltio data management platform unifies core data from across the enterprise, giving every agent immediate access to the same business context. This unified approach enables enterprises to move faster, act smarter, and unlock the full value of AI.

Agents will define the future of the enterprise. Context intelligence will determine who leads it.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Berlin’s energy transition sector got a defining boost today as Cloover, a climate fintech based in Berlin, announced it has secured more than $1.2 billion in total capital commitments, combining Series A equity and a substantial debt facility to accelerate the rollout of its software and financing platform across Europe.

The financing package includes €18.8 million (approximately $22 million) in Series A equity, led by MMC Ventures and QED Investors, with participation from Lowercarbon Capital, BNVT Capital, Bosch Ventures, Centrotec, and Earthshot Ventures.

Alongside that, a €1.02 billion debt facility provided by a major European bank will be deployed directly as customer and installer financing through Cloover’s platform, backed by a €300 million guarantee from the European Investment Fund to support scalable, low-cost lending for clean energy projects.

For a company that only a few years ago was in seed-stage fundraising, the scale of these commitments marks a striking shift. The debt element is operational capital designed to help manufacturers, installers, and homeowners finance solar panels, batteries, heat pumps, and other distributed energy technologies under a single unified system.

Cloover was founded in 2023 by Jodok Betschart, Peder Broms, and Valentin Gönczy, who arrived at the idea after interviewing hundreds of installers across Europe and hearing the same frustrations: fragmented software stacks, manual processes, and limited access to project financing. They saw a structural gap in the energy transition; demand for decentralised power had surged, but the financing and platform infrastructure to scale it weren’t keeping pace.

That gap is what Cloover’s platform intends to close. At its core is an integrated operating system that combines workflow management, procurement, financing, energy optimisation, and risk analytics into one environment that serves all parts of the distributed energy value chain. Installers can offer financing at the point of sale, streamline operations, and reduce administrative drag.

Homeowners, in turn, gain access to installations with lower upfront costs and financing terms linked to projected energy savings rather than traditional credit scoring.

Some investors now call Cloover the “Shopify for energy”, a digital backbone that supports the entire process of deploying distributed energy systems at scale. The model is built around scalable capital deployment combined with end-to-end software automation, including AI-driven tools for underwriting and operations.
The timing of this financing is noteworthy.

Across Europe, demand for residential solar and decentralised energy solutions is accelerating as regulatory pressure, rising electricity prices, and broader electrification trends push households and businesses toward clean alternatives. Yet installers often struggle with financing bottlenecks. Cloover’s platform embeds capital directly into the sales workflow, turning financing from a hurdle into a built-in feature.

In a statement, CEO Jodok Betschart framed the new financing as a way to enable energy independence without the friction of upfront costs or complex loan applications, noting that the company’s AI operating system connects stakeholders across the value chain.

For European climate tech and energy markets, the scale of Cloover’s backing is remarkable. Few startups in this space have bridged software infrastructure and finance at this magnitude, and the size of the debt commitment signals deep lender confidence in distributed energy as a growth asset class.

It sets a potential precedent for how renewable energy projects can be financed and adopted more quickly across the region, something both policymakers and industry leaders have identified as essential to meeting the EU’s climate goals.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">To many readers, this may sound like a paradox: how can knowledge ever become invaluable?

In this article, I want to explore how corporate knowledge, when poorly structured and rigidly transferred, can slowly transform from an asset into a disadvantage. Not only for companies, but especially for employees. And over time, that disadvantage compounds.

The journey usually looks familiar. You apply for a job, speak with a recruiter, send your CV, go through interviews, and eventually receive the green-light email: “Congratulations, you’re hired.”

This moment takes us directly to the real turning point: the onboarding process.

Those first one, two, sometimes even three months when you are introduced to the people, the tools, the workflows, the strategies, and the “way things are done.” On paper, onboarding exists to accelerate integration and performance. In reality, in many corporations, it quietly becomes an indoctrination phase.

Relatable to anyone who has worked in large organizations, onboarding often shifts from enabling understanding to enforcing conformity. New hires are not only taught what the company knows, but also what the company no longer questions.

This is where corporate knowledge starts becoming invaluable.

Because instead of acting as a foundation to build on, it becomes a ceiling.

It tells you what to do, how to do it, and more importantly, what not to rethink. Over time, this “do according to the manual” culture doesn’t just standardize execution. It standardizes thinking. And standardized thinking is the natural enemy of innovation.

History shows us a consistent pattern: breakthroughs rarely come from the center of an industry. They come from the edges.

Elon Musk was not an automotive executive. He treated cars as computers on wheels and energy systems. The result? An entire industry forced to reset its assumptions.

Travis Kalanick and Garrett Camp were not transportation insiders. They were technologists. They saw GPS-enabled phones, invisible payments, and drivers that didn’t need to be owned. They reframed taxis not as a fleet problem, but as a software and trust problem. And the taxi industry, as it existed, effectively ended.

These examples point to a simple truth: transformative ideas usually emerge from new mental models, not from perfected manuals.

Yet most onboarding processes are designed to remove new mental models as quickly as possible.

They don’t ask: “What do you see that we no longer notice?”
 They ask: “How fast can you adapt to how we already work?”

Most programs teach tools, not systems. New hires learn where to click, not how to think. They are trained on CRMs, scripts, workflows, and reporting routines, but not on AI-assisted decision-making, signal-based prospecting, or how to design work alongside automated agents.

As a result, organizations scale activity instead of intelligence.

Even worse, onboarding still assumes that humans should work like software: following rigid processes, filling manual reports, executing predefined sequences. Instead of being taught how to orchestrate software, delegate to AI, and concentrate on judgment, creativity, and relationships.

Over time, this creates a paradoxical outcome: the more “knowledge” an organization accumulates, the harder it becomes for new ideas to survive inside it.

And when knowledge can no longer be challenged, recombined, or re-imagined, it stops being knowledge.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">In a Davos dominated by talk of tariffs, subsidies, and geopolitical risk, Europe used the stage to question its own economic limits. At the World Economic Forum, Ursula von der Leyen put forward one of the clearest signals yet that the European Union is preparing a structural shift in how it treats business, competitiveness, and economic power.

The phrase that stuck, “Europe Inc”, is not the name of a regulation, nor a new Brussels invention ready to roll out. It is a political framing for a shift that the European Commission wants to accelerate.

What Europe Inc actually refers to is an idea long discussed in EU policy circles and now pushed into the spotlight: the so-called 28th regime. An optional, EU-wide corporate framework that would sit alongside national systems and allow companies to operate across the bloc under a single legal structure.

The problem it is meant to solve is real and well-documented. Europe has a single market in theory, but in practice, companies still face 27 different company laws, registration processes, capital requirements, and administrative timelines. Startups incorporate in one country, then struggle to expand. Scaleups hit legal friction. Many leave.

The Commission’s answer is simplification through centralisation. Under the proposed 28th regime, entrepreneurs would be able to set up a company digitally, once and use that structure across the EU. One registration, one legal form, one set of rules. The ambition presented at Davos goes further: company creation within 48 hours, fully online.

That figure matters. It is also where political ambition risks being read as immediate reality.

The 48-hour setup is not in force. It is a target attached to a proposal that still needs to be formally drafted, negotiated, and approved by both the European Parliament and member states. Nothing in current EU law allows this yet. What exists is intent, not implementation.

Von der Leyen was explicit about why this push is happening now. Global conditions have hardened. Trade is increasingly weaponised. Industrial policy has returned, unapologetically, in the US and China.

Supply chain shocks and energy crises exposed Europe’s vulnerabilities. In that environment, regulatory fragmentation stops being a technical issue and becomes a strategic one.

Europe Inc is Brussels admitting that rules alone do not build power. Scale does. There is also a political recalibration underway. The EU has traditionally defined itself as a regulator first, a market shaper second.

The message from Davos suggests a change in emphasis: competitiveness, capital mobilisation, and strategic autonomy are moving closer to the centre of EU policymaking.

Still, limits remain. The 28th regime, as currently described, would be optional. It would not harmonise taxation overnight. Labour law, insolvency rules, and social policy remain largely national domains. Europe Inc would coexist with national systems, not replace them.

That coexistence is both its strength and its risk. Optional frameworks can attract fast-growing companies, but they can also deepen a two-speed Europe if not carefully designed. This tension is not resolved yet.

What Davos revealed is not a finished Europe Inc, but a Commission willing to say openly that Europe’s economic model, as it stands, is too slow for the world it operates in. Whether Europe Inc becomes a meaningful tool or another unrealised promise will depend less on slogans and more on legislation, compromise, and political courage across 27 capitals.

For now, Europe Inc is best understood as a warning shot. Europe intends to compete as a bloc, not as a collection of administrative borders. The clock, as von der Leyen implied, is already running.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Belgian business software company Odoo, also a unicorn, has reached a fresh milestone. Growth investor General Atlantic has increased its stake in the firm, buying additional shares from regional backer Wallonie Entreprendre and pushing Odoo’s valuation to roughly €7 billion.

This move isn’t a typical funding round where a company raises new capital. Instead, it’s a secondary transaction: General Atlantic bought existing shares that were previously held by Wallonie Entreprendre, the investment arm of Belgium’s Walloon region. After the deal, Wallonie Entreprendre still holds about 3 % of the company.

Odoo was founded in 2002 in Belgium and has grown steadily from a small project into a global software platform. It offers an integrated suite of business applications used by small and medium-sized enterprises for everything from finance and sales to HR and marketing.

The software is built on an open-core model that encourages developers around the world to build add-on apps, creating a vast ecosystem of nearly 40,000 extensions.

Today, Odoo counts more than 170,000 paying customers in around 180 countries. That global footprint and the steady revenue growth it has delivered helped convince General Atlantic to deepen its involvement.

Since first investing in the company in 2023, the firm has supported Odoo’s expansion into new markets and helped refine its commercial strategy.

Part of what makes this update noteworthy is how Odoo has expanded its product offerings. Its newest versions include AI-infused features and automation tools that make the suite more attractive to businesses looking to replace outdated, fragmented systems with a single, unified digital platform.

For the European tech scene, this development highlights a shift in how successful software companies grow and attract capital. Rather than chasing quick exits or IPOs, some founders are choosing secondary share deals to let early investors realise gains while keeping strategic control.

That path can make it easier for companies to stay private longer and focus on building value over time.

I don’t know what is happening in Belgium or what they are having for breakfast, but the country itself has quietly become a place where software businesses can scale internationally.

Odoo is one of its standout success stories, showing that strong product focus, community-driven development, and global reach can win serious backing from major growth investors.

            <div id="article-text">For a long time, tech events were built around scale. The bigger the crowd, the stronger the perception of success. Attendance numbers became a proxy for impact, and festivals grew year after year because that was what the industry expected.

That model no longer fits how tech leaders work today.

Over the past years, I have spent time in conversations with founders, executives, and operators who carry real responsibility inside their organizations. As a community builder, I often speak with them before they commit to attending events. Their questions are direct. They want to know who will be in the room, how discussions are structured, and whether the environment allows honest exchange.

Almost none of them ask how many people will attend.

This is a meaningful signal. Leaders who run companies do not optimize for visibility. They already have it. They want rooms where time leads to insight, clarity, and decisions.

As CEO of Tekpon AI Summit, I have had a front row seat to how decision makers actually want to engage today. I have watched what happens on large stages. I have also watched what happens when ten relevant people sit around one table with no audience and no agenda beyond honest discussion.

The difference in outcome is hard to ignore. In small rooms, people speak openly. They share challenges they would never publish. They explore partnerships without formalities. They make decisions faster because trust forms naturally when everyone present has earned their place in the conversation.

In larger settings, the dynamic changes. Conversations stay cautious. Stories become polished. The real questions are postponed, usually for later. Later often disappears into busy schedules.

Large conferences still play a role. They introduce new voices to the ecosystem. They create energy. They give exposure to early-stage founders. That contribution remains valuable.

But they are no longer where serious business gets done.

The work that shapes companies happens in environments where attention is protected and trust forms quickly. Where people can speak without performing. Where context is shared. Where participants know that what is said in the room stays in the room. These conditions are difficult to build at a mass scale and natural in small, curated settings.

This has already changed how senior decision makers allocate their time. Many are reducing their presence at large events. They are choosing closed discussions, private dinners, and carefully selected gatherings where every participant has a reason to be there. They are not rejecting conferences. They are rejecting formats that do not respect their attention.

The industry is slow to react to this shift. Event strategies still chase attendance growth, sponsorship volume, and social media reach. Meanwhile, the people shaping companies are quietly changing their behavior. They are voting with their calendars.

This gap will continue to widen. Events that optimize for volume will struggle to attract senior leaders. Once you see this up close, it becomes hard to unsee. The criteria for choosing where to meet have changed. Not loudly, not publicly, but consistently.

Some will still chase scale. Others will keep building large festivals and broad platforms. There is nothing wrong with that. But the people shaping companies are already making different choices. They are selecting rooms where conversations move faster, trust forms naturally, and time feels respected.

That is where tech leaders now choose to meet.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Venture capital powerhouse Sequoia Capital is preparing to invest in Anthropic, the AI startup best known for its Claude family of large language models, in one of the largest private funding rounds in tech this year. The deal is being led by Singapore’s GIC and U.S. investor Coatue, each contributing roughly $1.5 billion, as part of a planned raise of $25 billion or more at a staggering $350 billion valuation.

This move stands out for two reasons: the size and speed of the valuation surge and the fact that Sequoia, already an investor in rival AI builders such as OpenAI and Elon Musk’s xAI, is broadening its exposure across competing AI platforms.

Traditionally, top-tier VC firms have avoided backing direct competitors simultaneously. The logic was simple: protect information flows and avoid internal conflicts of interest. Sequoia’s willingness to back Anthropic despite existing stakes in other AI outfits signals a shift in how investors view the AI market. It reflects a belief that the sector is large enough to support multiple winners rather than requiring firms to choose a single champion.

Anthropic itself has grown quickly since its founding by former OpenAI researchers. Industry reporting shows the company has attracted significant talent from established AI labs and introduced advanced models and enterprise features, contributing to its rapid valuation climb over the past year.

A $350 billion valuation, even before a public listing, is eye-watering. It resets expectations for what private AI companies can command and puts pressure on competitors to secure equally large capital backing or risk falling behind. Analysts suggest that few AI firms may go public at these valuations, pointing instead to continued private rounds or alternative exit strategies if market sentiment shifts.

That dynamic is a symptom of a broader trend: a global AI capital rush that has persisted even amid concerns about a bust cycle or a funding slowdown in other tech segments. Investors remain convinced that AI will reshape industries from software to logistics, health care, and beyond, and are willing to deploy extraordinary sums to secure influence in that future.

For European markets and founders, the Sequoia-Anthropic deal carries both opportunities and warnings. Europe has strong academic AI talent, an active startup ecosystem, and deep expertise in areas like robotics, industrial automation, and data privacy.

Yet venture capital density still trails the U.S., and marquee AI funding rounds of this scale are rare on the continent.
This investment could accelerate European interest in AI startups, drawing more attention and potentially more capital into the region.

It reinforces the idea that global capital flows are not limited by geography and that talent mobility, not territory, increasingly defines the AI race. European AI talent has been moving among global hubs, and deals like this underline how strongly competitive pressures are shaping that movement.

At the same time, the concentration of huge capital in a few dominant players raises strategic questions for European policymakers and investors. If global valuations continue to centralise power and resources in U.S. and Asia-based AI giants, Europe’s AI initiatives may struggle to build regional champions with equivalent scale.

Efforts to foster AI ecosystems, from regulatory clarity to public funding mechanisms, will be tested in the face of such capital dynamics.

Sequoia’s bet on Anthropic, despite its exposure to rivals, underscores a fundamental truth about where the AI race is headed: talent and execution matter more than regional advantage.

For European startups, this means honing in on distinctive technical niches, enterprise traction, and real-world impact rather than simply following headline valuations.

The Anthropic round may be a moment of spectacle, but its lasting impact will be measured in how ecosystems evolve, how talent flows, and how global competition shapes opportunities for innovation across borders. European players can benefit from these trends, but only if they leverage their own strengths in research, ethics-led deployment, and deep industry partnerships.

In the end, this deal isn’t just about money; it’s a signal of where confidence lies in the next chapter of AI, and who stands to gain as a result.
