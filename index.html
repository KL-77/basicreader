            <h2>Netflix to pay all cash for Warner Bros. to fend off Paramount hostile takeover</h2>
            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-01-20</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2026/01/netflix-to-pay-all-cash-for-warner-bros-to-fend-off-paramount-hostile-takeover/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Netflix agreed to pay all cash for Warner Bros. Discovery, amending its $72 billion deal in an attempt to fight off Paramount’s hostile takeover bid.

Netflix originally agreed to buy the company with a mix of cash and stock. To sweeten the offer for shareholders, Netflix and Warner Bros. today announced that Netflix will pay all cash instead. If successful, Netflix’s purchase will include HBO Max, WB Studios, and other assets.

The price is unchanged at $27.75 per share, and Warner Bros. is targeting an April 2026 shareholder vote. The original plan was for Netflix to buy each Warner Bros. share with $23.25 in cash and $4.50 in Netflix stock.

The revised agreement “simplifies the transaction structure,” “accelerates the path to a WBD stockholder vote,” and “provides enhanced certainty around the value WBD stockholders will receive at closing, eliminating market-based variability,” today’s press release said. Netflix plans to finance the deal with “a combination of cash on hand, available credit facilities and committed financing.”

Netflix’s pending purchase of Warner Bros. has an equity value of $72 billion and an enterprise value of $82.7 billion, which includes both equity and debt. Paramount Skydance has been trying to upend the deal with its own offer to buy Warner Bros. in a hostile takeover attempt that includes a lawsuit it filed against Warner Bros. last week.

Paramount offered $108.4 billion at $30 per share, but it’s trying to buy the entire Warner Bros. Discovery company, while Netflix’s deal is for just the streaming and movie studios divisions. The Warner Bros. board wants to complete a separate spinoff of its cable TV division, which would not be possible if Paramount’s hostile takeover succeeds. The spinoff is scheduled to be completed before the closing of the sale to Netflix, and the spun-off entity would be called Discovery Global.

“By transitioning to all-cash consideration, we can now deliver the incredible value of our combination with Netflix at even greater levels of certainty, while providing our stockholders the opportunity to participate in management’s strategic plans to realize the value of Discovery Global’s iconic brands and global reach,” Warner Bros. Discovery board Chairman Samuel Di Piazza Jr. said in today’s press release.

Paramount also made an all-cash offer, but the Warner Bros. board called the Paramount bid “illusory” because it requires an “extraordinary amount of debt financing” and other terms that allegedly make it less likely to be completed than a Netflix merger.

Paramount “is a $14B market cap company with a ‘junk’ credit rating, negative free cash flows, significant fixed financial obligations, and a high degree of dependency on its linear business,” while Netflix has “market capitalization of approximately $400 billion, an investment grade balance sheet, an A/A3 credit rating and estimated free cash flow of more than $12 billion for 2026,” Warner Bros. told shareholders.

Warner Bros. and Netflix today continued to tout Netflix’s strong financial position and its ability to close the deal. “Netflix’s strong cash flow generation supports the revised all-cash transaction structure while preserving a healthy balance sheet and flexibility to capitalize on future strategic priorities,” the joint press release said.

The Wall Street Journal explained that the new “deal structure does away with a so-called collar, a mechanism meant to protect shareholders from large swings in an acquirer’s share price between the time when a deal is announced and when it closes. If Netflix shares dipped below $97.91, Warner shareholders were to get a larger portion of Netflix shares as part of the deal. If they rose above $119.67, shareholders would have received a smaller portion.”

Netflix’s stock price closed at $100.24 on December 5 and is down to about $88, partly due to investor fears that Netflix will have to pay more to complete the merger.

The Paramount lawsuit against Warner Bros. alleges that the company board failed to disclose basic information that stockholders need to decide between the Paramount and Netflix bids. The lawsuit seeks details on how Warner Bros. valued the shares in its planned spinoff, and other information such as how Warner Bros. determined that the Paramount offer was too risky.

“WBD shareholders need this information to make an informed investment decision on our offer—and importantly, Delaware law has consistently required that such information be provided to shareholders,” Paramount CEO David Ellison wrote in a letter to Warner Bros. shareholders after filing suit in Delaware Chancery Court.

Paramount says its own analysis of Discovery Global assets values the spinoff company at $0 per share.

“WBD has provided increasingly novel reasons for avoiding a transaction with Paramount, but what it has never said, because it cannot, is that the Netflix transaction is financially superior to our actual offer,” Ellison wrote. Warner Bros. reportedly responded that Paramount “has yet to raise the price or address the numerous and obvious deficiencies of its offer,” and “is seeking to distract with a meritless lawsuit and attacks on a board that has delivered an unprecedented amount of shareholder value.”

Paramount’s lawsuit hasn’t been an immediate success. A judge last week rejected Paramount’s request to expedite the case, saying it did not suffer “cognizable irreparable harm” from the allegedly inadequate disclosures.</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">TCL is taking majority ownership of Sony’s Bravia series of TVs, the two companies announced today.

The two firms said they have signed a memorandum of understanding and aim to sign binding agreements by the end of March. Pending “relevant regulatory approvals and other conditions,” the joint venture is expected to launch in April 2027.

Under a new joint venture, Huizhou, China-headquartered TCL will own 51 percent of Tokyo, Japan-headquartered Sony’s “home entertainment business,” and Sony will own 49 percent, per an announcement today, adding:

The joint venture will operate globally, handling the full process from product development and design to manufacturing, sales, logistics, and customer service for products including televisions and home audio equipment.

The joint venture will continue to release TVs and home audio gadgets under the “Sony Bravia” branding; however, the TVs will rely on TCL display technology. The joint announcement suggested focuses on bigger TVs, higher-resolution displays, and “smart features.”

The news comes as the TV industry has struggled with decreasing margins and has become more competitive. Meanwhile, devices have become cheaper, and people are buying new TVs less frequently. Competition between Chinese companies, like TCL and Hisense, and South Korean firms, like LG and Samsung, has heated up, with Chinese companies making increasingly competitive budget and mid-range-priced TVs, and the South Korean government reportedly pushing local TV firms to work together. Numerous Japanese companies, including Toshiba and Sharp, have already exited or reduced their TV businesses.

The upcoming joint venture also comes as Sony has focused less on electronics in recent years. For example, it stopped making its Vaio PCs in 2014 and quit Blu-rays last year. Meanwhile, it has been focusing on intellectual property, like anime and movies, as Bloomberg noted. The joint venture should allow Sony to focus on its more lucrative businesses and allow TCL to gain an advantage by leveraging Sony’s more high-end Bravia devices and brand.</div>

            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2026/01/the-first-commercial-space-station-haven-1-is-now-undergoing-assembly-for-launch/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">As Ars reported last week, NASA’s plan to replace the International Space Station with commercial space stations is running into a time crunch.

The sprawling International Space Station is due to be decommissioned less than five years from now, and the US space agency has yet to formally publish rules and requirements for the follow-on stations being designed and developed by several different private companies.

Although there are expected to be multiple bidders in “phase two” of NASA’s commercial space station program, there are at present four main contenders: Voyager Technologies, Axiom Space, Blue Origin, and Vast Space. At some point later this year, the space agency is expected to select one, or more likely two, of these companies for larger contracts that will support their efforts to build their stations.

To get a sense of the overall landscape as the competition heats up, Ars recently interviewed Voyager chief executive Dylan Taylor about his company’s plans for a private station, Starlab. Today we are publishing an interview with Max Haot, the chief executive of Vast. The company is furthest along in terms of development, choosing to build a smaller, interim space station, Haven-1, capable of short-duration stays. Eventually, NASA wants facilities capable of continuous habitation, but it is not clear whether that will be a requirement starting in 2030.

Until today, Haven-1 had a public launch date of mid-2026. However, as Haot explained in our interview, that launch date is no longer tenable.

Ars: You’re slipping the launch of Haven-1 from the middle of this year to the first quarter of 2027. Why?

Max Haot: This is obviously our first space station, and we’re moving as safely and as fast as we can. That’s the date right now that we are confident we will meet. We’ve been tracking that date, without slip, for quite a while. And that’s still a year, probably two years or even more, ahead of anyone else. It will be building the world’s first commercial space station from scratch, from an empty building and no team, in under four years.

Haot: Last Saturday (January 10) we reached the key milestone of fully completing the primary structure, and some of the secondary structure; all of the acceptance testing occurred in November as well. Now we are starting clean room integration, which starts with TCS (thermal control system), propulsion, interior shells, and then moving on to avionics. And then final close out, which we expect will be done by the fall, and then we have on the books with NASA a full test campaign at the end of the year at Plum Brook. Then the launch in Q1 next year.

Ars: What happens after you launch Haven-1?

Haot: We are not launching Haven-1 with crew inside. It’s a 15-ton, very valuable and expensive satellite, but still no humans involved, launching on a Falcon 9. So then we have a period that we can monitor it and control it uncrewed and confirm everything is functioning perfectly, right? We are holding pressure. We are controlling attitude. These checkouts can happen in as little as two weeks.

At the end of it, we have to basically convince SpaceX, both contractually and with many verification events, that it will be safe to dock Dragon. And if they agree with the data we provide them, they will put a fully trained crew on board Dragon and bring them up. It could be as early as two weeks after, and it could be as late as any time within three years, which is a lifetime of Haven-1. But we have a very strong incentive to send a crew as quickly as we can safely do so.

Haot: We are in deep negotiations, maybe more than that, with both private individuals and nation states. But there’s nothing we are ready to announce yet. Especially with the Q1 launch date, in our desire to follow with the crew right after, this is now becoming pretty urgent. We believe, with our partner at SpaceX, one year for training is very comfortable, and we think we can compress it to maybe as little as six months for both training on Dragon and Haven-1 so long as we have an experienced crew. So we have a bit of time left to announce it.

Ars: You mentioned Haven-1 has a three-year lifetime. How many crews will you try to cycle through?

Haot: The nominal plan is for a two-week mission, and we have one fully contracted with SpaceX, as well as a second one that we have a deposit and an option on. And then we plan to do two more. That’s assuming they are 10-day missions with two days of transfer on either side. So two-week missions. We also have the option to maybe do a 30-day mission if we want. So the exact duration and makeup will be decided as we make progress with customers and potentially NASA.

Haot: If you look at the first module of our second station, what will be the difference? We have two docking ports, not one. We expect to have more power, and potentially more volume, depending on the launch vehicle. What you see on our website and what we do might be different. We have a lot of optionality. But other than that, it’s all of the exact same components of Haven demo and Haven-1, which are basically being iterated on. And so that’s the key. The life support system, the air revitalization system, the software, the primary structure—the first module of Haven-2 will be just tweaks on Haven-1. That’s why we think we’re in the best position of all of the competitors. And that’s not been enabled by chance, right? It’s been enabled by a billion-dollar investment in 1,000 employees and all the facilities to mass produce the follow-on modules.

Ars: NASA is nearing the second phase of its competition for commercial space stations, known as CLDs. Do you plan to compete with Haven-1 or Haven-2 for these contracts?

Haot: We have not decided because, as you know, it’s unclear yet what the requirements will be. Will they be asking for a 30-day demonstration flight? On our end it’s unclear if we want to bid that 30-day demonstration with Haven-1, or Haven-2 with two or three modules. If they ask for a 30-day mission, we have the option to offer it on Haven-1 in 2027 if we want to.

Ars: Last week a key space staffer in the US Senate, Maddy Davis, said she was “begging” for NASA to release the phase two “request for proposals” that would set the ground rules for the CLD competition. Do you feel the same way?

Haot: Vast is dedicated to ensuring we have continuous human presence in low-Earth orbit after the ISS is retired. The date we are aiming at is end of 2030. Maddy mentioned an ISS extension. We agree, for America, if no one is ready it should be extended. But in our view, we will be ready, and we need to make sure we’re ready to start a continuous crewed mission by the end of 2030. That’s less than five years away now, right? So we definitely agree with the sentiment, and I think the full industry agrees, and I’m pretty sure Jared Isaacman also agrees that it is overdue and it’s time to make a decision and release an RFP.

Ars: What do you hope to see in that RFP when it comes to requirements?

Haot: We obviously can’t decide what NASA will do, and we will be competitive in whatever they decide. But there’s a few key recommendations we feel strongly about. The first one is that, as they consider whether they proceed with a demonstration mission or something else, we think they should focus on what is right for the country. What we are hearing is that they are trying to tweak the approach to do something fair to all of the bidders. And I don’t think it should matter whether people have been doing a right thing or wrong thing, and whether what’s right for the country puts somebody in a better position or not.

The second piece, obviously, is to move faster, which we just talked about. The third piece is that we think it’s really important that they require a demonstration. If you look at every human space flight program in history, none of them went straight from the program starting to a long-duration mission on a spacecraft. They all had a stepping stone, and right now none of us has proven we can have humans safely on orbit in a space station. And so in our view, they should require demonstration, and not on the eve of January 1, 2031. They should require a demonstration with crew as quickly as possible before they buy services.

Ars: You mentioned doing the “right thing for the country.” What does that mean for NASA?

Haot: It means you’re focused on commercial stations being ready by 2030, so there is not a need to extend the ISS. And it means ensuring we have not just one winner, but two, in case history repeats itself, such as Boeing and SpaceX in crew transportation.

Ars: Do you think the government has committed enough funding to make the commercial space station program a success?

Haot: I’m a vendor, and obviously I’d like as much buffer as possible, and as much funding as possible. With the current budget we don’t think more than two winners is reasonable, but it should absolutely be two in the best interest of the country. If there was a bigger budget, obviously, three would be great. And so if you look at the CLD budget line, which is approved for next year—projected over five years for development, and you assume two winners, and then services that come later—we are confident we can be successful and profitable with two companies operating.

Obviously, we also need international customers, right? We need Europe. We need Japan, where we just opened a subsidiary. We need all the new emerging human spaceflight nations in the Middle East, in Europe, in Asia. And a little bit of private spaceflight. We’re not in a space tourism era, in orbit, but there are still some private individuals willing to fund a mission and do important work. With that, we get to profitability.

We think a big differentiator of Vast is that we are really excited and eager to unlock the orbital economy. I’m talking about in-space semiconductor, fiber, pharmaceutical manufacturing, and so on. We think that’s our upside. We want to unlock it. But we don’t know how quickly it will happen or how big it will be. What we do know is, whoever has a platform up there with flight crew, facilities, and power will be the one unlocking it. But in our business model, if that’s delayed, we can still be profitable.</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">KENNEDY SPACE CENTER, Florida—Preparations for the first human spaceflight to the Moon in more than 50 years took a big step forward this weekend with the rollout of the Artemis II rocket to its launch pad.

The rocket reached a top speed of just 1 mph on the four-mile, 12-hour journey from the Vehicle Assembly Building to Launch Complex 39B at NASA’s Kennedy Space Center in Florida. At the end of its nearly 10-day tour through cislunar space, the Orion capsule on top of the rocket will exceed 25,000 mph as it plunges into the atmosphere to bring its four-person crew back to Earth.

“This is the start of a very long journey,” said NASA Administrator Jared Isaacman. “We ended our last human exploration of the moon on Apollo 17.”

The Artemis II mission will set several notable human spaceflight records. Astronauts Reid Wiseman, Victor Glover, Christina Koch, and Jeremy Hansen will travel farther from Earth than any human in history. They won’t land. That distinction will fall to the next mission in line in NASA’s Artemis program.

But the Artemis II astronauts will travel more than 4,000 miles beyond the far side of the Moon (the exact distance depends on the launch date), setting up for a human spaceflight speed record during their blazing reentry over the Pacific Ocean a few days later. Koch will become the first woman to fly to the vicinity of the Moon, and Hansen will be the first non-US astronaut to do the same.

“We really are ready to go,” said Wiseman, the Artemis II commander, during Saturday’s rollout to the launch pad. “We were in a sim [in Houston] for about 10 hours yesterday doing our final capstone entry and landing sim. We got in T-38s last night and we flew to the Cape to be here for this momentous occasion.”

The rollout began around sunrise Saturday, with NASA’s Space Launch System rocket and Orion capsule riding a mobile launch platform and a diesel-powered crawler transporter along a throughway paved with crushed Alabama river rock. Employees, VIPs, and guests gathered along the crawlerway to watch the 11 million-pound stack inch toward the launch pad. The rollout concluded about an hour after sunset, when the crawler transporter’s jacking system lowered the mobile launch platform onto pedestals at Pad 39B.

The rollout keeps the Artemis II mission on track for liftoff as soon as next month, when NASA has a handful of launch opportunities on February 6, 7, 8, 10, and 11.

The big milestone leading up to launch day will be a practice countdown, or Wet Dress Rehearsal (WDR), currently slated for around February 2, when NASA’s launch team will pump more than 750,000 gallons of super-cold liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen into the rocket. NASA had trouble keeping the cryogenic fluids at the proper temperature, then encountered hydrogen leaks when the launch team first tried to fill the rocket for the unpiloted Artemis I mission in 2022. Engineers implemented the same fixes on Artemis II that they used to finally get over the hump with propellant loading on Artemis I.

So, what are the odds NASA can actually get the Artemis II mission off the ground next month?

“We’ll have to have things go right,” said Matt Ramsey, NASA’s Artemis II mission manager, in an interview with Ars on Saturday. “There’s a day of margin there for weather. There’s some time after WDR that we’ve got for data reviews and that sort of thing. It’s not unreasonable, but I do think it’s a success-oriented schedule.”

The Moon has to be in the right position in its orbit for the Artemis II launch to proceed. There are also restrictions on launch dates to ensure the Orion capsule returns to Earth and reenters the atmosphere at an angle safe for the ship’s heat shield. If the launch does not happen in February, NASA has a slate of backup launch dates in early March.

Ars was at Kennedy Space Center for the rocket’s move to the launch pad Saturday. The photo gallery below shows the launcher emerging from the Vehicle Assembly Building, the same facility once used to stack Saturn V rockets during the Apollo Moon program. The Artemis II astronauts were also on hand for a question and answer session with reporters.

The first flight of astronauts on the SLS rocket and Orion spacecraft is running at least five years late. The flight’s architecture, trajectory, and goals have changed multiple times, and technical snags discovered during manufacturing and testing repeatedly shifted the schedule. The program’s engineering and budgetary problems are well documented.

But the team readying the rocket and spacecraft for launch has hit a stride in recent months. Technicians inside the Vehicle Assembly Building started stacking the SLS rocket in late 2024, beginning with the vehicle’s twin solid-fueled boosters. Then ground teams added the core stage, upper stage, and finally installed the Orion spacecraft on top of the rocket last October.

Working nearly around the clock in three shifts, it took about 12 months for crews at Kennedy to assemble the rocket and prepare it for rollout. But the launch campaign inside the VAB was remarkably smooth. Ground teams shaved about two months off the time it took to integrate the SLS rocket and Orion spacecraft for the Artemis I mission, which launched on the program’s first full-up unpiloted test flight in 2022.

“About a year ago, I was down here and we set the rollout date, and we hit it within a day or two,” said Matt Ramsey, NASA’s mission manager for Artemis II. “Being able to stay on schedule, it was a daily grind to be able to do that.”

Engineers worked through a handful of technical problems last year, including an issue with a pressure-assisted device used to assist the astronauts in opening the Orion hatch in the event of an emergency. More recently, NASA teams cleared a concern with caps installed on the rocket’s upper stage, according to Ramsey.

The most significant engineering review focused on proving the Orion heat shield is safe to fly. That assessment occurred in the background from the perspective of the technicians working on Artemis II at Kennedy.

The Artemis II team is now focused on activities at the launch pad. This week, NASA plans to perform a series of tests extending and retracting the crew access arm. Next, the Artemis II astronauts will rehearse an emergency evacuation from the launch pad. That will be followed by servicing of the rocket’s hydraulic steering system.

All of this leads up to the crucial practice countdown early next month. The astronauts won’t be aboard the rocket for the test, but almost everything else will look like launch day. The countdown will halt around 30 seconds prior to the simulated liftoff.

It took repeated tries to get through the Wet Dress Rehearsal for the Artemis I mission. There were four attempts at the countdown practice run before the first actual Artemis I launch countdown. After encountering hydrogen leaks on two scrubbed launch attempts, NASA performed another fueling test before finally successfully launching Artemis I in November 2022.

The launch team repaired a leaky hydrogen seal and introduced a gentler hydrogen loading procedure to overcome the problem. Hydrogen is an extremely efficient fuel for rockets, but its super-cold temperature and the tiny size of hydrogen molecules make it prone to leakage. The hydrogen feeds the SLS rocket’s four core-stage engines and single upper-stage engine.

“Artemis I was a test flight, and we learned a lot during that campaign getting to launch,” said Charlie Blackwell-Thompson, NASA’s Artemis II launch director. “The things that we’ve learned relative to how to go load this vehicle, how to load LOX (liquid oxygen), how to load hydrogen, have all been rolled into the way in which we intend to load the Artemis II vehicle.”

NASA is hesitant to publicly set a target launch date until the agency gets through the dress rehearsal, but agency officials say a February launch remains feasible.

“We’ve held schedule pretty well getting to rollout today,” Isaacman said. “We have zero intention of communicating an actual launch date until we get through wet dress. But look, that’s our first window, and if everything is tracking accordingly, I know the teams are prepared, I know this crew is prepared, we’ll take it.”

“Wet dress is the driver to launch,” Blackwell-Thompson said. “With a wet dress that is without significant issues, if everything goes to plan, then certainly there are opportunities within February that could be achievable.”

One constraint that threw a wrench into NASA’s Artemis I launch campaign is no longer a significant factor for Artemis II. On Artemis I, NASA had to roll the rocket back to the Vehicle Assembly Building (VAB) after the wet dress rehearsal to complete final installation and testing on its flight termination system, which consists of a series of pyrotechnic charges designed to destroy the rocket if it flies off course and threatens populated areas after liftoff.

The US Space Force’s Eastern Range, responsible for public safety for all launches from Florida’s Space Coast, requires the flight termination system to be retested after 28 to 35 days, a clock that started ticking last week before rollout. During Artemis I, technicians could not access the parts of the rocket they needed to in order to perform the retest at the launch pad. NASA now has structural arms to give ground teams the ability to reach parts higher up the rocket for the retest without returning to the hangar.

With this new capability, Artemis II could remain at the pad for launch opportunities in February and March before officials need to bring it back to the VAB to replace the flight termination system’s batteries, which still can’t be accessed at the pad.</div>

            <h2>The first new Marathon game in decades will launch on March 5</h2>

            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2026/01/bungies-delayed-marathon-revival-will-finally-launch-march-5/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">It has been nearly three years now since Destiny maker (and Sony subsidiary) Bungie formally announced a revival of the storied Marathon FPS franchise. And it has been about seven months since the game’s originally announced release date of September 23, 2025, was pushed back indefinitely after a reportedly poor response to the game’s first Alpha test.

But today, in a post on the PlayStation Blog, Bungie revealed that the new Marathon would finally be hitting PS5, Windows, and Xbox Series X|S on March 5, narrowing down the monthlong March release window announced back in December.

Unlike Destiny 2, which transitioned to a free-to-play model in 2019, the new Marathon sells a Standard Edition for $40 or a $60 Deluxe Edition that includes some digital rewards and cosmetics. That mirrors the pricing of the somewhat similar Arc Raiders, which recently hit 12 million sales in less than 12 weeks.

Unlike the original Marathon trilogy on the ’90s Macintosh—which closely followed on the single-player campaign corridors and deathmatch multiplayer of the original Doom—the new Marathon is described as a “PvPvE survival extraction shooter.” That means gameplay based around exploring distinct zones and scavenging for cosmetics and gear upgrades in exploratory missions alone or with up to two friends, then seeing those missions “break into fast-paced PvP combat” at a moment’s notice, according to the game’s official description.

A new preorder trailer expands on other more gameplay-focused videos showcasing the poisoned world of Tau Ceti IV and the six competing factions of highly customizable “runner shells” they’ll inhabit. Bungie has also revealed a scavenging-focused “Rook” option for players who want to queue up solo and join a match in progress with nothing but a starting kit.

“Instead of focusing on progression and questing and things of that sort, [Rook] is a mode where we make it easy for you to just kind of drop into a match that’s in progress and run about and try to scavenge as much as possible and get out with it, so that you can populate your vault a little bit more for future runs,” Game Director Joe Ziegler said in a recent video.

The Marathon revival project has faced its fair share of development troubles in recent years. That includes public accusations that early test gameplay included plagiarized artwork, leading the development team to announce a “thorough review of our in-game assets.” Internal plans to release the game in 2024 were reportedly pushed back an entire year amid pessimism among developers. More recently, the game got a new creative director in June, which isn’t exactly a sign of confidence that late in a long-running project.

After all that—and given a Bungie gaming pedigree that dates back to the original Marathon—it’s fair to say that the new Marathon is going to get more than its fair share of attention when it finally gets into players’ hands in just six weeks.</div>

            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2026/01/signs-point-to-a-sooner-rather-than-later-m5-macbook-pro-refresh/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Mac power users waiting on new high-end MacBook Pro models may have been disappointed last fall when Apple released an M5 upgrade for the low-end 14-inch MacBook Pro without touching the M4 Pro or Max versions of the laptop. But the wait for M5 Pro and M5 Max models may be nearing its end.

The tea-leaf readers at MacRumors noticed that shipping times for a handful of high-end MacBook Pro configurations have slipped into mid-to-late February, rather than being available immediately as most Mac models are. This is often, though not always, a sign that Apple has slowed down or stopped production of an existing product in anticipation of an update.

Currently, the shipping delays affect the M4 Max versions of both the 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pros. If you order them today, these models will arrive sometime between February 3 and February 24, depending on the configuration you choose; many M4 Pro versions are still available for same-day shipping, though adding a nano-texture display or upgrading RAM can still add a week or so to the shipping time.

Apple could choose to launch new Pro hardware on January 28 to go with the new Creator Studio subscription it announced last week. Aimed primarily at independent content creators who make their own video, audio, and images, the Creator Studio subscription bundles Final Cut Pro, Logic Pro, Pixelmator Pro, and enhancements for the Pages, Numbers, and Keynote apps (along with some other odds and ends) for $13 a month or $130 a year. None of these apps require a MacBook Pro, but many would benefit in some way from the additional CPU and GPU power, RAM, and storage available in Apple’s high-end laptops.

Of course, an imminent replacement isn’t the only reason why the shipping estimates for any given Mac might slip. Ongoing, AI-fueled RAM shortages could be causing problems, and Apple probably prioritizes production of the widely used base-model M4 and M5 chips to the larger, more expensive, more complex Max models.

But the only other device in Apple’s lineup that offers the M4 Max and similar RAM configuration options is the high-end Mac Studio, which currently isn’t subject to the same shipping delays. That does imply that the delays are specific to the MacBook Pro—and one explanation for this is that the laptop is about to be replaced.

Virtually every Mac in Apple’s lineup is ready for an M5-series refresh. Only the low-end 14-inch MacBook Pro got an M5 upgrade last year, a relatively restrained rollout compared to the M3 and M4 generations—the M4 generation hit all the MacBook Pros, the iMac, and the Mac mini at the same time. That has left a lot of Macs eligible for an update at some point in 2026, including the Pros, the MacBook Airs, the Mac mini, the iMac, the Mac Studio, and the Mac Pro tower.

Apple has been known to skip Apple Silicon chip generations for some models in the past, so a handful of systems may stick with the M4 until the M6 rolls around. The MacBook Pros and Airs are reliably updated with each new chip generation, but the desktop Macs have all missed at least one chip update since the Apple Silicon era began.

Reporting from Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman also suggests that the Mac Pro may be on life support—even if an M5 Ultra chip arrives for the Mac Studio, there’s no guarantee that the Mac Pro (currently still rocking an M2 Ultra) will get the same chip.

On top of the existing Macs that we expect to see updated, Apple is rumored to be introducing an all-new Mac this year: a new entry-level model with an iPhone-class Apple A-series processor inside. This device is said to be a direct replacement for the M1 MacBook Air that Apple still sells for $599 via Walmart in the US, years after removing the model from its own retail and online stores.

Expect any replacement to share a lot in common with the old M1 Air, including its 13-inch screen size and (possibly) its paltry-by-modern-standards 8GB of RAM. But for $400 less than the starting price of the M4 MacBook Air, this low-end Mac would still serve a kind of customer that would otherwise have only Windows laptops and Chromebooks to consider.

The Walmart website currently has “low stock” of the M1 MacBook Air—it may be that we can also expect that new low-end MacBook sooner rather than later.</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Last week, we broke down a major debacle unfolding in the health research space. To recap: over the past month, concerned researchers have been sounding the alarm about a reprehensible vaccine study which was to be funded by the United States Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to the tune of $1.6 million.

According to the trial protocols, obtained by Inside Medicine writer and physician Jeremy Faust from an anonymous American employee at the US Center for Disease Control (US CDC), the research would have followed 14,000 infants in the West African nation of Guinea-Bissau. The problem? Only 7,000 of those newborns would have received an urgently needed hepatitis B vaccine, in order to compare the two groups. On top of the flagrant ethics violations, the total cost of the research would have exceeded the cost to pay for “over a decade’s worth of Hepatitis B vaccine birth doses [for everyone] in Guinea-Bissau.”

In their interview with Faust, the unnamed CDC employee called it “another Tuskegee,” a reference to the Tuskegee syphilis study, in which hundreds of Black men with syphilis were studied by government researchers — who never informed them of their disease or made them aware of the treatment that had been discovered for it.

“I have read every word of the protocol dated January 14, 2026,” Faust told Futurism in an email. “It is wretched.”

At the time of our writing, the Guardian had reported that officials with the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention — the public health agency run by the African Union, not to be confused with the US CDC — stated that the trial had been halted, seemingly by Guinea-Bissau’s public health authorities.

This is where things get weird. In an email responding to our post about the situation, an official from the HHS press office declared that the vaccine trial was still on.

“To be clear, the trial will proceed as planned,” the spokesperson insisted. “Africa CDC, an organization with no affiliation to the US CDC, shared weeks-old communications unrelated to the trial as part of a public-relations campaign aimed to shape public perception rather than engaging with the scientific facts.”

The official also makes it clear that the HHS sees these infants more like lab rats than human beings.

“This research represents the world’s first, and potentially only, opportunity to rigorously evaluate the overall health effects of [hepatitis B],” they continued.

Those comments are astonishing enough. But in followup remarks that they insisted were “on background” — despite the fact that we’d agreed to no such arrangement — they went on to disparage their colleagues at the Africa CDC in coarse terms that were striking even by the standards of the notoriously churlish Trump administration.

“This is a powerless, fake organization attempting to manufacture credibility by repeating its claims publicly,” the spokesperson wrote. “It is not a reliable source, and its statements should be treated accordingly.”

The HHS didn’t respond to repeated requests to explain the outburst.

It’s a stunning comment about the Africa CDC, the official health agency of the African Union, which represents 55 African nations. This isn’t some fly-by-night shell operation — it’sa health organization that served as the COVID-19 testing hub for 48 African countries at the outbreak of the pandemic, and which has coordinated millions of emergency vaccines for infectious diseases ranging from malaria to mpox.

In October, the World Health Organization and the Africa CDC signed a landmark collaboration agreement to “consolidate their partnership” and “accelerate progress toward shared health goals.” Simply put, if there were any serious question of Africa CDC’s legitimacy, the WHO — a specialized agency of the United Nations — would not have signed off on this strategic agreement.

As for the HHS claiming the controversial study is still on, the Africa CDC tells us there’s a press conference this Thursday — so we’ll be watching.

            <h2>The CEO of Microsoft Suddenly Sounds Extremely Nervous About AI</h2>
            <p><strong>Futurism | 2026-01-20</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://futurism.com/artificial-intelligence/microsoft-ceo-nervous-ai">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">It sounds like Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella is already coming up with excuses in case the whole AI boom turns out to be a massive bust— which, by the way, he’s warning might come to pass.

Speaking at the World Economic Forum at Davos, Switzerland on Tuesday, Nadella pontificated about what would constitute such a speculative bubble, and said that the long-term success of AI tech hinges on it being used across a broad range of industries — as well as seeing an uptick in adoption in the developing world where it’s not as popular, the Financial Times reports. If AI fails, in other words, it’s everyone else’s fault for not using it.

Nadella explained the pitfalls the AI industry would need to avoid, perhaps betraying his own anxieties about its future.

“For this not to be a bubble by definition, it requires that the benefits of this are much more evenly spread,” Nadella said, as quoted by the FT. The “tell-tale sign of if it’s a bubble,” he added, would be if only tech companies were benefitting from the rise of AI. He gave the example of a pharmaceutical company using AI to accelerate drug trials; it doesn’t need to be used to discover the “magical molecule,” but provide some other tangible, less extraordinary benefit to developing the product.

Nadella is adamant that these kinds of boosts that AI provides will justify AI and carry the industry, stressing less spectacular and more practical applications of the tech.

“I’m much more confident that this is a technology that will, in fact, build on the rails of cloud and mobile, diffuse faster, and bend the productivity curve, and bring local surplus and economic growth all around the world,” he proclaimed.

Nadella’s anxiety-tinged and more mundane-sounding forecasts for AI’s future comes as he’s been notably defensive about AI lately, as Microsoft reaffirms its commitment to spend tens of billions more on data centers and other AI-related costs. Earlier this month, he begged the public to stop using the term “slop,” the rapidly accepted new lingo for describing the shoddy text, images, and videos churned out by AI models, which Merriam-Webster crowned word of the year. Nadella’s thesis seemed to be that we should stop being mean about AI as it refines its “jagged edges” — which could take a while, by his own admission.

He isn’t alone in tamping down his promises for AI as a cloud of uncertainty looms over the industry, with experts continuing to raise the specter of AI progress hitting a wall, and noting that years into the AI boom, the tech still hasn’t yielded meaningful gains in productivity. Many tech CEOs not named Elon Musk have tried to pretend that they haven’t been using the pursuit of building a fabled artificial general intelligence, or AGI, as the rallying cry for the industry this whole time, as the idea of creating such a system that surpasses human intelligence seems more and more far fetched in the immediate term.

Striking a similar tone, OpenAI CFO Sarah Friar declared that the company will focus on “practical adoption” of AI in 2026, and “how people, companies, and countries are using it day to day.” ChatGPT users will soon get a first hand look of what this pivot to practical economics looks like: last week, the company announced that free users will start being targeted with sponsored ads and content based on their conversations.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Earlier this month, NASA announced that it had to cancel a scheduled spacewalk, citing a “medical situation” affecting a “single crew member who is stable” on board the International Space Station.

The mystery illness eventually led to the space agency staging the first medical evacuation in 25 years of continuous operation on board the aging orbital outpost, rushing four astronauts back to Earth in a move that brought the station’s number of occupants from seven to a skeleton crew of just three.

While the medical incident only affected a single astronaut, who has yet to be identified for privacy reasons, all four members of the Crew-11 mission cut their time on board the ISS short by weeks, safely splashing down off the coast of San Diego early Thursday morning.

The four astronauts were airlifted to the Scripps Memorial Hospital in San Diego via helicopter for a “planned overnight stay at a local medical facility for additional evaluation,” according to a January 16 statement. After being “released as expected,” they continued their journey to NASA’s Johnson Space Center in Houston, where they will “continue standard postflight reconditioning and evaluations.”

Do you know anything about what caused the evacuation from the ISS? Drop us a line at tips@futurism.com. We can keep you anonymous.

“All crew members remain stable,” the space agency reassured. “To protect the crew’s medical privacy, no specific details regarding the condition or individual will be shared.”

It’s an exceedingly rare event, highlighting the challenges inherent to providing healthcare in space. While hundreds of miles above the surface, specialized care is hard, if not impossible, to execute. While astronauts undergo rigorous EMT-level training so they can respond to emergencies on board the station, they aren’t full-blown medical professionals, and can only do so much under the direction of doctors back on Earth.

There’s a lot to still learn about providing care during medical emergencies, particularly when it comes to long-duration space exploration missions into deep space. According to a 2022 study, there still are plenty of “gaps in knowledge regarding the potential for unanticipated in-flight medical events to affect crew health and capacity, and potentially compromise mission success.”

As researchers from Northumbria University in Newcastle point out in a recent essay for The Conversation, medical emergencies are remarkably rare on the ISS, despite being expected to occur on average every three years. Studies have shown that the most common health issues astronauts experience are skin irritation, congestion, disruptions to sleep, and in-flight injuries — most of which are ironically caused by exercise, which is designed to protect astronauts’ long-term health.

Spending prolonged periods in a microgravity environment has also been shown to affect astronauts’ vision and blood pressure.

Now that there’s finally been a medical emergency on the station, though, it’s unclear whether the public — or even the broader medical community — will ever find out any details.

            <div id="article-text">Anybody who’s regularly driven in winter conditions knows the importance of keeping windshield washer fluid topped up. Keeping the salty grime stuck to your windshield and rear window to a minimum is crucial for visibility, especially in inclement weather.

In the case of an autonomously operating vehicle, ensuring visibility for the vehicle’s sensors could similarly be a matter of life and death. That’s particularly true for Tesla’s Cybercab ride-hailing vehicles, which rely entirely on camera feeds. Recent sightings of an early prototype in Chicago — a city known for its harsh and long winters — suggest the EV maker is taking the matter seriously, opting to install a rear-facing camera washer to keep obstructions to a minimum.

Images of the salt-covered prototype show liquid — presumably windshield washing liquid or antifreeze — dripping down its rear bumper, almost as if it had a runny nose.

The Cybercab has a rear camera washer!This is a feature than many Tesla owners have been asking for, especially in snowy areas. Hope it makes it to the rest of the lineup. https://t.co/ufrUvrSnun pic.twitter.com/nueAsqz2YO

The design change suggests the Elon Musk-led company is taking active measures to ensure its Cybercabs can operate in actual winter outside of its home states of California and Texas.

Tesla is hoping to expand its autonomous Robotaxi system in cities across the country. In November, the company announced that Las Vegas, Phoenix, Dallas, Houston, and Miami are next. Why the cab was spotted in Chicago remains unclear.

However, others lamented the fact that the company’s EV lineup, which has since been seemingly relegated to the bottom of the company’s priority list, had yet to benefit from a similar washer system, despite being on sale for many years now. Rear camera washer systems are a common feature among many production vehicles from other carmakers.

“This is a feature that many Tesla owners have been asking for, especially in snowy areas,” tweeted automotive journalist Sawyer Merritt. “Hope it makes it to the rest of the lineup.”

Tesla first showed off its Cybercab during a flashy event in October 2024. The odd design sparked a heated discussion, with critics pointing out its diminutive size — it can only fit two passengers — as well as a possibly unrealistic target price, and plenty of far-reaching promises about wireless charging.

At the time, Musk promised that the vehicle would enter production in 2027. Then, during the company’s Q3 earnings call last year, he promised that volume production would instead be reached in 2026.

“At this point, I feel 100 percent confident that we can sell unsupervised full self-driving at a safety level much greater than human,” he told investors.

But given the state of the company’s EV software, which is still leading to plenty of collisions and near-misses even when the weather is playing along, the company has its work cut out to realize Musk’s ever-ambitious vision.

That’s particularly true when it comes to rolling out an autonomous ride-hailing service in places that experience extreme weather, from frozen-over roadways to a barrage of salt that can clog up vehicle sensors in a heartbeat.

Let’s hope Tesla is aware that keeping the antifreeze topped up will be far more mission-critical than one might think.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">In 2021, a crew of self-described free speech martyrs announced they were founding a university to save American higher education from the scourge of cancel culture. They called it the University of Austin, or UATX — and though it lacks accreditation, they boasted that it would be a place where controversial ideas could breathe free, and students wouldn’t live in fear of the woke mob.

Pretty much from the jump, critics of UATX suspected the project was less about “freedom of speech” and more about building a right-wing echo chamber for aggrieved libertarians. It operated out of a former retail store in downtown Austin, with funding from “anti-woke” philanthropists like Palantir co-founder Joseph Lonsdale.

Over the next few years, those critics would be proven correct in spectacular style. According to comprehensive reporting by Politico, in April of 2025 Lonsdale called an all-staff meeting that threw the entire project into a tailspin. Per the reporting, the billionaire told faculty and staff they must all subscribe to the “four principles of anti-communism, anti-socialism, identity politics, and anti-Islamism.” Anyone who didn’t toe the line would be frozen out.

In other words, the school supposedly founded to buck political litmus tests was issuing its own extremely stringent political litmus test — and threatening anyone who didn’t get on board with cancellation.

After that, everything changed. Staff and advisors began fleeing in droves. Students became disillusioned with the “university’s” mission. The founding president, Shakespeare scholar Pano Kanelos, stepped down from his role to take a largely ceremonial position as “Chancellor,” from which he would resign just a few months later.

One student told Politico: “I’ve never felt my speech was so chilled as it was in the classroom at UATX.”

Though a constitutional charter supposedly laid out a democratic process to resolve differences of opinion, these seemed to melt away at the request of figures like Lonsdale. The institution, as one staffer put it, had been “building the plane while we’re flying it.”

UATX, built to save students from the evils of cancel culture, has now become exactly what it claimed to oppose: an institution where the administration can end your academic career on a whim, where dissent from right-wing orthodoxy is not to be tolerated — and where the people most obsessed with cancel culture can finally do the cancelling.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Microsoft is hellbent on stuffing Windows 11 with AI — and many feel that this is coming at the expense of the operating system’s usability.

That aggrieved sentiment now seems more vindicated than ever, after Microsoft rolled out a new update that prevented users from shutting down their PCs — a core functionality that there should be zero excuses for not working.

The patch, released on January 13, was the first security update of the new year, and ultimately created more issues than it fixed. As Microsoft tells it, a bug related to its System Guard Secure Launch security feature was preventing users from shutting down or hibernating their PCs, and instead caused them to get stuck in an endless shutdown loop in which they either didn’t finish the process and stayed powered on, or simply restarted. This created a potential security risk for devices left unattended, not to mention an unnecessary strain on the power bill.

To fix the issue, Miscrosoft rushed out a emergency out-of-band update this Saturday, a typically rare intervention that these days is feeling more and more common, The Verge noted in its coverage. And while the scale of the issue does not appear to be outright disastrous — as only PCs installed with an older edition of Windows 11, 23H2, and specifically the Enterprise or IoT editions, were affected — it’s nonetheless an embarrassingly glaring oversight.

“When you vibe code an OS,” joked one Redditor, mocking Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella’s boast that as much as 30 percent of the company’s code is now written with AI.

The buggy update comes as Microsoft is facing more and more heat for its Ahabian monomania for AI. Executives at the company have described turning Windows 11 into an “agentic OS” and even a full-blown “canvas for AI.” These changes have included stuffing Microsoft’s AI chatbot Copilot in the OS’ file explorer, and testing features like Copilot Vision and Copilot Actions, which collectively allow the AI to analyze user’s screens to perform tasks on their behalf. The company has also frequently experimented with new ways of shoving a button for Copilot into the system’s interface.

It’s not surprising, then, that earlier this month, the term “Microslop” went viral online. It was a direct response to Nadella’s plea that we should stop using the slang “slop,” the recently crowned word-of-the-year for describing the shoddy text, images, and videos mass produced by AI models.

Ironically, Microsoft’s obsession with AI also appears to be blowing back on the employees building it, as The Verge reported last week that the company was shutting down its Redmond HQ library in favor of pursuing an “AI-powered learning experience.”

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Amazon CEO Andy Jassy says consumers are beginning to see higher prices as sellers look to absorb added costs from President Donald Trump’s tariffs.

Jassy told CNBC that Amazon and many of its third-party sellers stocked up on inventory ahead of the tariffs to keep prices low, but that most of that supply run out last fall.

“So you start to see some of the tariffs creep into some of the prices, some of the items, and you see some sellers are deciding that they’re passing on those higher costs to consumers in the form of higher prices, some are deciding that they’ll absorb it to drive demand and some are doing something in between,” Jassy said. “I think you’re starting to see more of that impact.”

Amazon’s comment signals a shift from last year, when Jassy had said prices had not risen after Trump announced the tariffs.

Jassy said on Tuesday that while Amazon is trying to keep prices low, price hikes may be unavoidable in some instances.

“At a certain point, because retail is, as you know, a mid-single digit operating margin business, if people’s costs go up by 10%, there aren’t a lot of places to absorb it,” Jassy said. “You don’t have endless options.”

Despite the tariffs, consumers are “pretty resilient,” Jassy said, noting that some shoppers are shifting to cheaper items and bargain hunting, while others are putting off premium discretionary purchases.

            <p><strong>TechCrunch | 2026-01-20</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/20/ice-becomes-one-of-the-most-blocked-accounts-on-bluesky-after-its-verification/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">ICE (U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement) has now become the No. 3 most-blocked account on Bluesky, after receiving its official verification on Friday, according to third-party trackers. Bluesky users, unsurprisingly, are angry about the government account being hosted on the platform. Many are recommending that others block the account directly or subscribe to a block list that includes all of the U.S. government’s official accounts.

The blocklist was introduced after the White House and other government agencies under the Trump administration signed up for Bluesky last October to post messages blaming Democrats for the government shutdown. The accounts that joined at the time included the Departments of Homeland Security, Commerce, Transportation, the Interior, Health and Human Services, State, and Defense, in addition to the White House itself.

The move made the White House one of the most-blocked accounts on Bluesky, and today it remains in the No. 2 position, just behind Vice President J.D. Vance, per stats shared on the tracking site Clearsky. (The site leverages Bluesky’s API to track which accounts are the most blocked and other blocking activity.)

ICE, however, did not join Bluesky in October. According to Bluecrawler’s Join Date Checker, the account @icegov.bsky.social joined the social network on November 26, 2025.

The account was verified a few days ago according to the independently-run Verified Account Tracker, which suggests that either Bluesky’s team didn’t have enough information to apply the verification checkmark, was somehow unaware of the account’s existence (doubtful!), or was internally debating how to handle the issue. Bluesky hasn’t responded to a request for comment.

One tracker now shows the ICE account as being over 60% of the way to being the most-blocked Bluesky account.

ICE today has many accounts across other social media sites, including X, Instagram, Facebook, YouTube, and LinkedIn. These accounts tend to be verified on platforms that have a verification mechanism, with YouTube being an exception.

The decision from Bluesky to host and verify ICE establishes the social network as one that’s now fitting in more with other, larger social media giants, rather than with the original ethos of the open social web known as fediverse, where the user community is more in control of which accounts gain attention and traction.

The fediverse, which represents a network of independent but interconnected social media platforms, includes apps like Mastodon, Pixelfed, PeerTube, Flipboard, and, to some extent, Instagram Threads, though Meta’s app isn’t fully federated. The U.S. government doesn’t have Mastodon accounts, but users can follow accounts like @potus on Threads from their Mastodon accounts, if they choose.

One reason for avoiding Mastodon, an open source federated app that runs on the ActivityPub protocol, could be its smaller size. But also, any government account joining this network could be easily blocked by individual server operators. This wouldn’t prevent the account from setting up its own server to post to the fediverse, but other communities could refuse to federate (interoperate) with that server, greatly diminishing its reach.

Mastodon’s founder Eugen Rochko, who stepped down as CEO in November, citing burnout, recently posted an anti-ICE message on Mastodon, noting that “Abolish ICE” doesn’t go “nearly far enough” to address the problem in the U.S.

A day later, he announced he was opting his account out of the bridge that connects Mastodon with Bluesky.

Bridging technology, which includes the project known as Bridgy Fed, is meant to allow different decentralized platforms to connect with each other, even if they run different protocols, as is the case with Bluesky, which runs on AT Protocol. Coincidentally, Bridgy Fed today launched a way to add domain blocklists to bridged accounts, which would conceivably allow fediverse users to block the government agencies posting on Bluesky.

Reached for comment, Rochko wouldn’t confirm whether or not ICE’s participation on Bluesky was a factor in his decision to leave the bridge, saying that the decision was a “personal” one.

However, there has often been tension between the fediverse and the atmosphere, or the decentralized social platform that includes Bluesky and other, newer networks and apps like Blacksky, Northsky Social, and more. Because the networks have different approaches to decentralization, they each have their own supporters and critics, some of whom can’t even agree that the networks should be bridged in the first place.

            <div id="article-text">Corina Marshall spent 11 years working in retail digital marketing and realized the industry was behind the times.

Specifically, the technology that helped retail brands sell unsold or excess products (off-channel inventory) wasn’t as sophisticated as it could have been. Brands sell their excess inventory at discount retailers like Nordstrom Rack, but often lose money because managing unsold inventory is difficult. Products are spread across warehouses, and teams are left guessing the value of an item and when the best time to sell it is.

“Too much time passes between each step of the off-channel inventory funnel, making it difficult to move products to the destinations that are most favorable for the brands and retailers,” Marshall told TechCrunch.

She decided to give the off-channel market a tech boost. In 2024, she launched her company Another, a software system that helps companies manage unsold or excess products. The secondary markets where these items are usually sold operate under tight timelines and can feature highly dynamic pricing due to fluctuating demand. For a retailer to succeed in a place like Nordstrom Rack, it needs to have fast access to real-time data and coordination so that clothes can efficiently move from the retailer to the warehouse to the store, she said.

Another connects to a business’s existing software systems, such as those that manage customer returns, to better centralize an organization’s data and workflows. This way, teams across the company can access data from the same place, making decision-making more effective.

The company announced Tuesday a $2.5 million seed round led by Anthemis FIL and Westbound.

Marshall said she met her lead investors through an industry event last year and said the fresh capital will be used to speed product development and hire. She considers her competitors’ marketplaces like Ghost, another company that also helps brands sell unsold inventory.

However, she said, Another hopes to help companies address excess inventory before brands opt to sell items to bulk resellers. She says items sold through such resellers may be deeply discounted, an outcome brands might not want.

“Another’s technology provides real-time data and insights that give teams confidence in when, where, and how to move inventory, enabling smarter decisions that maximize value rather than defaulting to liquidation,” she said. Overall, she hopes her product helps move the industry toward solutions that better balance profitability and sustainability, as excess inventory is often destroyed if it is not moved quickly enough.

“Consumers gain access to better prices, more optionality, while brands and retailers improve profitability and reduce waste, making it a win for everyone involved.”

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">One of the more prominent alternative app stores that emerged in the EU as a result of the region’s Digital Markets Act is shutting down. The store, Setapp Mobile, from the Ukrainian-based developer MacPaw, first launched in September 2024, offering dozens of apps across categories like productivity, finance, video, photo, creativity, and more.

Its model offered consumers access to all of Setapp’s mobile apps through a $9.99 monthly subscription, provided the user’s Apple ID was associated with an EU member state.

Now the company says all applications will be removed from Setapp Mobile by the end of the sunset date, February 16, 2026. Applications that are available on Setapp Desktop will not be affected, the company told TechCrunch.

The news of the shutdown, announced on Setapp’s support site, was first spotted by MacRumors.

MacPaw stated that “still-evolving and complex business terms that don’t fit Setapp’s current business model” are the reason for its decision.

The “complex business terms” being referenced here are Apple’s complicated set of fees for apps operating under its new business terms in the EU, which include a controversial Core Technology Fee that charges developers €0.50 for each first annual install over 1 million in the past 12 months.

The tech giant revised its fee structure last year to avoid further penalties for noncompliance with the Digital Markets Act (DMA), but instead of simplifying the fees, it made them more complex.

One result of these constant changes is that developers can’t properly plan how to grow and monetize their business. It also suggests the fees, as they stand, don’t make running an alternative app store in the EU a viable option.

In a statement shared with TechCrunch, Setapp said it found its business model was not “viable,” as the commercial conditions continued to change. The statement reads:

Setapp Mobile was a bold, breakthrough project that aimed to provide EU iOS users with access to alternative app marketplaces — creating a new app ecosystem where both developers and users could thrive. We are proud of what we have accomplished with it over the past two years and still believe passionately in this vision. As a result of still-evolving commercial conditions, we have determined that it is not viable to continue development or support for Setapp Mobile within Setapp’s current business model. While we are disappointed to discontinue Setapp Mobile and let down our user base and developer community in the EU, we are looking forward to pursuing the development of other innovations.

There are still other alternative app stores operating in the EU, including, most notably, the Epic Games Store from the maker of Fortnite and the open source AltStore.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Grubhub parent company, Wonder, announced that it has acquired Claim, a restaurant rewards app.

Founded in 2021, Claim offers cash-back rewards for local restaurants that users can redeem for dine-in or pickup orders. Restaurants partner with Claim to create promotions, boost foot traffic, and track performance insights through the Claim dashboard.

The financial terms of the deal were not disclosed; however, Claim raised a total of $20 million, it said, when it raised its $12 million Series A in October, 2024. PitchBook estimated its valuation at $62 million.

Grubhub says the acquisition will give restaurants on its platform access to Claim’s customer acquisition and retention tools, while Grubhub diners will receive additional savings and rewards for dining out.

“By combining a delightful rewards experience and powerful machine learning models, we match restaurants with their next regulars. Claim is a game-changer for these businesses, and joining Grubhub marks an exciting new chapter as we scale to reach millions more diners and thousands of restaurants,” Claim CEO and co-founder Sam Obletz in a statement.

Grubhub told TechCrunch that all members of the Claim team were extended offers to join Grubhub.

Under Grubhub, Claim will enable more restaurants to connect with consumers through personalized rewards. Grubhub says this will reduce customer-acquisition costs and drive repeat visits, all without adding operational complexity.

“Claim’s innovative rewards technology introduces a powerful new way for our restaurant partners to engage in-person diners and builds on Grubhub’s robust existing suite of marketing tools,” said Grubhub CEO Howard Migdal in a statement. “With Grubhub and Claim together under one roof, we can scale Claim’s data-driven tools to our more than 415,000 merchants and help our nearly 20 million diners save more money at the restaurants they love.”

Claim is now available to Grubhub merchants and diners in New York City, with a nationwide rollout planned for later this year.

Grubhub told TechCrunch that Claim will continue to be available to its current merchants and consumers through the Claim app and website “for the time being.” In the coming months, the company plans to create a “streamlined experience” across the Grubhub and Claim apps for both restaurant partners and diners, but didn’t share specifics on what this could look like.

For current Claim users, Grubhub says there may be some changes to the product and how rewards are paid out, but that users can continue to expect personalized promotions and rewards for going to local restaurants.

Investors in Claim included VMG Technology, Sequoia Capital, Susa Ventures, Lightbank, and Metalab Ventures.

            <p><strong>TechCrunch | 2026-01-20</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/20/humans-a-human-centric-ai-startup-founded-by-anthropic-xai-google-alums-raised-480m-seed-round/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Humans&, a startup with a philosophy that AI should empower people rather than replace them, has raised $480 million in seed funding at a $4.48 billion valuation, reports The New York Times. Investors in the round include chipmaker Nvidia, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, and VC firms SV Angel, GV, and Laurene Powell Jobs’ firm Emerson Collective.

The megadeal for the three-month-old company follows a trend of investors throwing money at startups founded by breakaways of major AI labs. Humans&’s founders include Andi Peng, a former Anthropic researcher who worked on reinforcement learning and post-training of Claude 3.5 through 4.5; Georges Harik, Google’s seventh employee, who helped build its first advertising systems; Eric Zelikman and Yuchen He, two former xAI researchers who helped develop the Grok chatbot; and Noah Goodman, a Stanford professor of psychology and computer science.

The company’s 20-odd employees also come from OpenAI, Meta, Reflection, AI2, and MIT, according to the company. The startup aims to use software to help people collaborate with each other — think an AI version of an instant messaging app. One of their goals is to use existing AI techniques to train AI in new ways, like programming chatbots to request information from the user and store it for later use.

In order to build AI that serves “as a deeper connective tissue that strengthens organizations and communities,” Humans& hopes to rethink “how we train models at scale and how people interact with AI,” per the company’s web page. The startup cited a need for innovations in “long-horizon and multi-agent reinforcement learning, memory, and user understanding,” as well as a tightly integrated focus on both science and product development.

The Humans& seed round, while enormous, is far from an outlier in the current AI funding environment. The largest seed round in history, for now, belongs to Thinking Machines Lab, which raised $2 billion last July at a $12 billion valuation, led by Andreessen Horowitz. Founded by former OpenAI CTO Mira Murati alongside top researchers from Meta and Google, the company initially attracted enormous enthusiasm, though the departure of half of the company’s founding team across recent months suggests that massive capital and pedigree don’t guarantee immediate success.

Other notable mega-seed rounds include Unconventional AI’s $475 million raise in December at a $4.5 billion valuation — the company, founded by former Databricks AI head Naveen Rao, is developing energy-efficient neuromorphic computing systems — and Lila Sciences’ $200 million seed round last March for its autonomous AI-powered laboratory platform.

LMArena, the AI model benchmarking platform that spun out of UC Berkeley, similarly bolted out of the gate as a commercial venture, raising $100 million at a $600 million valuation last May. Earlier this month, the three-year-old outfit announced a $150 million Series A round at a post-money valuation of $1.7 billion.

            <h2>The Real Reason for the Drop in Fentanyl Overdoses</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-01-20</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/2026/01/opioid-overdose-decrease-fentanyl-china/685683/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">For two decades, the United States and Canada have struggled with a drug epidemic. From 2003 to 2022, annual overdose deaths in the United States rose from less than 26,000 to nearly 108,000—becoming the leading nonmedical cause of death, surpassing car accidents and gun violence combined. In Canada, overdose deaths increased almost tenfold in the same period. In both countries, the surge in deaths was supercharged by “synthetic” opioids such as fentanyl, the ultra-potent, lab-made narcotic that has come to dominate the supply of hard drugs.

Then, sometime in 2023, something miraculous happened: Death rates started dropping. In Canada, opioid-overdose deaths declined 17 percent in 2024, then continued falling sharply in the first six months of 2025 (the most recent months for which data are available). In America, preliminary data indicate that total drug deaths fell from their peak of just shy of 113,000 in the year ending August 2023 to about 73,000 in the year ending August 2025.

Although the numbers are still too high, the public-health community has responded to the decrease with jubilation—and confusion. Overdoses had been rising inexorably for 20 years. What changed?

A new paper, published earlier this month by a group of drug-policy scholars in the journal Science, presents a novel theory. The paper’s authors attribute the reversal not to any American or Canadian policy, but to a sudden fentanyl “drought,” which they say may have its causes not in North America, but in China.

Nick Miroff: Fentanyl doesn’t come through the Caribbean

If right, their conclusion implies a disheartening lesson amid the otherwise-welcome news. Nothing American or Canadian policy makers did—no amount of law enforcement, harm reduction, or opioid-settlement funds—made deaths start falling, the paper implies. America and Canada’s drug problem might be in China’s hands.

The paper’s authors draw on a variety of data—drug potency, law-enforcement actions, and, cleverly, social-media posts—to study the supply of fentanyl over time. Most of what drug dealers sell on the street isn’t 100 percent pure fentanyl. Instead, dealers usually adulterate their drugs, combining fentanyl with inert powders such as sugar and baby powder, or mixing in other drugs to stretch the active ingredient. Recent years, for example, have seen a major increase in adulteration with the horse tranquilizer xylazine, which knocks users out but doesn’t satisfy the opioid craving. Such adulteration happens because users expect to pay the same amount for their drugs every time; dealers vary how much fentanyl they get for their dollar depending on how available the drug is. When purity goes down, it means the availability of fentanyl has, too.

Using data from the Drug Enforcement Administration, the paper’s authors observe that when overdose deaths began falling in mid-2023, the measured purity of fentanyl sold on the street began falling roughly in tandem. By the end of 2024, the data show, both overdose deaths and powder purity had fallen by about 50 percent—a dramatic concurrence.

The authors also look at DEA data on law-enforcement seizures of fentanyl, finding that these also slowed in the third quarter of 2023. This, they argue, is less attributable to any sort of strategy or personnel change and more to the fact that there appears to have been less fentanyl for law enforcement to seize. The authors also say that Canadian data, to the extent they are available, are consistent with this trend.

To further explore the possibility that fentanyl supply was plummeting, the authors also decided to look to an unusual source of data: Reddit forums dedicated to drugs‚ such as  r/fentanyl. From 2021 to early 2023, “droughts” were rarely mentioned at all. But beginning in late 2023, the term drought starts showing up in dozens of posts a month, an increase of as much as 1,900 percent. In other words: Users were noticing a supply crash, too.

Droughts have been known to reduce overdose deaths. For example, Australia experienced a significant “heroin drought” in 2001. According to a 2024 study, the drought cut opioid-overdose deaths by somewhere from 36 to 56 percent among a cohort of people using illicit opioids.

But if a fentanyl drought had come to North America, what was causing it? The paper’s authors suggest that the answer may be related to a 2023 China crackdown on fentanyl-precursor chemicals and the online platforms that sold them, itself following a summit between President Biden and Xi Jinping. That crackdown in turn may have made it harder for Mexican producers, who usually source their precursors from the Chinese gray market, to manufacture the drug. But that’s more of a speculation than a definitive answer, Jonathan Caulkins, a professor of public policy at Carnegie Mellon University and co-author of the paper, told me.

“I’m much more comfortable with the idea that supply has become less abundant,” Caulkins said, adding that he’s fundamentally “puzzled what it was that could have produced such a long-lasting reduction.”

Clearer than what caused the drought is what didn’t cause it. As deaths fell, many pointed to their preferred policies. Nora Volkow, the longtime director of the National Institute on Drug Abuse, attributed the decline to the increased availability of the overdose-reversing drug naloxone, as well as steps taken by Congress and the Biden administration to make opioid-addiction medication more available. The Biden DEA administrator Anne Milgram claimed law enforcement’s share of the credit, saying her agency had successfully put “pressure” on the cartels.

These explanations were never that convincing. Reducing drug deaths through enforcement is notoriously hard. Naloxone seems to have had no discernible effect on fentanyl deaths, though it has reduced deaths caused by other, less potent opioids. And a massive study that deployed both harm-reduction and treatment interventions across 67 communities from 2021 to 2022 yielded no statistically significant reduction in overdose deaths. These approaches all might make small differences, but they can’t explain the big drop.

Nor, the paper’s authors note, can they explain the glaring fact that overdose deaths went down in both the United States and Canada, which have very different drug-control-policy approaches. “Both countries, despite very different policies, seem to be riding the same wave of broad trends in supply and use,” Caulkins said. Which leaves American and Canadian policy makers with something of a disappointing victory: Deaths are down, but they may yet come back, and preventing that turn may be far beyond American and Canadian control.

Listen: A radical answer to the fentanyl crisis

Though we don’t know why the drought happened, it still offers opportunity. In 2019, a multiagency operation shut down a handful of drug gangs in Philadelphia’s Kensington drug market at once, effectively imposing a drought through policy. A rigorous study later concluded that overdose deaths fell as a result, and the use of addiction-treatment medication in the surrounding Delaware Valley—an area covering parts of three states—increased. When their supply dries up, some people get off drugs; now is a great time to help them.

But there are risks, too. An uncertain drug supply can drive some users to substitute other substances—xylazine, or the latest illicit tranquilizer, medetomidine—that are dangerous in their own right. And sudden drops in the availability of opioids can reduce chronic users’ tolerance, leading them to take too much and overdose when the drugs come back.

If we want to lock in the unexpected windfall from the drought, now is the time to focus on getting people clean. That’s a big lift, but the right combination of medication, therapy, and voluntary and involuntary treatment can make a difference. If we do nothing, though, then one day fentanyl will come back—and there will be little anyone can do.</div>

            <h2>America’s Would-Be Surgeon General Says to Trust Your ‘Heart Intelligence’</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-01-20</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/2026/01/casey-means-surgeon-general-religion-spirituality/685682/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">For the past year, the United States has gone without its doctor. Ever since Vivek Murthy resigned as surgeon general last January, the role has remained empty despite President Trump’s attempts to fill it. He first nominated the physician Janette Nesheiwat but withdrew her nomination in May after reports that she completed her M.D. not in Arkansas, as she had claimed, but in St. Maarten. In her place, Trump nominated Casey Means, whose background is odd, to say the least.

Means is a Stanford Medicine graduate who dropped out of her surgical residency and has since made a career infusing spiritual beliefs into her wellness company, social-media accounts, and best-selling book. The exact nature of her spirituality is hard to parse: Means adopts an anti-institutionalist, salad-bar approach. She might share Kabbalah or Buddhist teachings, or quote Rumi or the movie Moana. She has written about speaking to trees and participating in full-moon ceremonies, both of which drew ridicule by the conservative activist and unofficial Trump adviser Laura Loomer. Her belief in “the divine feminine” (which she doesn’t quite explain) seems to have led her to renounce hormonal birth-control pills for halting the “cyclical life-giving nature of women.”

Although months have passed since her nomination, Means has still not appeared before Congress—in part because she went into labor with her first child hours before her confirmation hearing was scheduled to begin. (Means did not respond to questions for this story. A spokesperson for Bill Cassidy, who chairs the relevant Senate committee, told me that “the hearing will be rescheduled in the future when Dr. Means is ready” but did not offer a more detailed timeline.) The United States’ year without a surgeon general raises questions about how necessary the role really is. But the surgeon general still serves as the government’s leading spokesperson on public health, and if Means is eventually confirmed, her theology will become rather consequential because it is deeply tied to her beliefs about health. In 2024, she declared in a Senate roundtable on chronic disease that “what we are dealing with here is so much more than a physical health crisis. This is a spiritual crisis.” Part of her solution to both of these crises is to reject experts and institutions in favor of something far more alluring: intuition.

Means wrote in 2024 that she grew up in the Catholic faith, but left the Church in college. She grew fascinated by lectures at the Self-Realization Fellowship Lake Shrine, a spiritual center in Pacific Palisades, California. SRF, the religious organization behind it, was founded in 1920 by Paramahansa Yogananda, the “father of yoga in the West,” whose image graced the album cover of Sgt. Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band. It accepts the teachings of Jesus and other spiritual masters and divinities, but nothing is seemingly as important as one’s personal relationship with God. Yogananda’s book, The Second Coming of Christ, posits that the Second Coming is not necessarily literal, but instead entails an awakening of the divine consciousness in ourselves.

SRF’s influence is apparent in Means’s advice that people follow their “heart intelligence” and “divine intuition” and avoid “blindly ‘trusting the science.’” In a newsletter sponsored by a probiotic-supplement company, she wrote that “applying the scientific method to health and disease has immense utility for helping us understand the natural world and live healthy, longer lives, but it feels increasingly like there is a campaign being enacted against our divine gifts of intuition and heart intelligence.” In another newsletter, she wrote about the role of divine intuition in deciding whether to drink raw milk: She wants to be free to look a local farmer in the eye, “pet his cow, and then decide if I feel safe to drink the milk from his farm.” (One could very well have a lovely experience with a farmer, Kevin Klatt, a registered dietitian and research scientist at UC Berkeley, told me, “but it isn’t going to change the fact that raw milk might give you listeria.”)

In the same newsletter championing bovine contact, Means laments a spiritual crisis of connection to nature. She frequently portrays nature as a force with humanity’s best interests at heart, nearly synonymous with God. In her book, she suggests that chronic stress and trauma can be treated by, among other things, spending time in nature and through “plant medicine”—specifically, psilocybin-assisted therapy. (Means has also written that psychedelics helped her be “one with the moon.”) In that sponsored newsletter, she warned of a prophecy she says was put forth by the Indigenous Kogi people of Colombia, in which humanity has only until 2026 to prove we want to right the wrongs we have foisted upon the Earth, or we will all die. “I use the Kogi prophecy metaphorically,” she wrote. “But I do feel we are on a road to disaster. I think we should take these messages seriously.” Natural disasters, she implied, are a “communication from God.”

Nature worship might be especially appealing at a time when trust in experts is declining and technology has become ever more inscrutable and overwhelming, Alan Levinovitz, a professor of religion at James Madison University and the author of Natural: How Faith in Nature’s Goodness Leads to Harmful Fads, Unjust Laws, and Flawed Science, told me. Means’s appeal to nature and intuition, he said, is empowering because it puts expertise back into everyday Americans’ hands.

The ambiguity of Means’s spiritual views strengthens her appeal—they can be interpreted to fit a wide array of belief systems. Her 2024 New York Times best seller, Good Energy, uses terms such as energy and life force, along with scientific-sounding descriptions of metabolic processes, to insinuate that the vibes are off in the American diet and lifestyle. (Means wrote Good Energy with her brother, Calley, who is now a close adviser to Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the secretary of Health and Human Services.) In her newsletter, she encourages her readers to “avoid conventionally grown foods at all costs,” and warns that buying nonorganic food is a vote to “diminish the life force on this planet” while the use of synthetic pesticides “is giving a poor signal to God (Source!) that we want this miracle to continue.” (Source insinuates a godlike or all-powerful entity.) “She’s drawing on lots of different ideas very freely and without much rigor in ways that feel good,” Joseph Baker, a sociologist specializing in religion at East Tennessee State University, told me. “That sort of allows her to seem like a visionary without having to specify anything.”

Emily Hilliard, a press secretary for the Department of Health and Human Services, wrote in an email that religious and spiritual beliefs should not be held against anyone who seeks a government job, and that Means’s “credentials, research background, and experience in public life give her the right insights to be the surgeon general who helps make sure America never again becomes the sickest nation on earth.” The surgeon general has little power to enforce policy, but can call on Congress to put warnings on products like the ones seen on cigarette packets, release guidelines and reports, and lend support to various initiatives. Means’s belief system—which Baker characterized as a “sacralization of the individual”—suggests that she will use that platform to invite Americans to master their own health. In Good Energy, Means writes of chronic conditions such as depression, anxiety, infertility, insomnia, heart disease, erectile dysfunction, and cancer, “The ability to prevent and reverse these conditions—and feel incredible today—is under your control and simpler than you think.”

That statement is one of many in which Means echoes elements of manifestation: the belief that thinking good thoughts and putting in effort begets good things, which Means says is real. She advocates “tapping into the abundance that is a sheer law of our universe” and calling on a higher power—“When was the last time you simply sat quietly and asked God/spirit/ancestors/nature to help show you the way and guide you to your highest purpose?” she wrote in her newsletter—but also putting in the hard, hard work.

Means goes beyond intuition and heart intelligence to offer concrete suggestions for labor (and spending) that will be divinely rewarded—essentially, a reimagined prosperity gospel. The nature of that work is detailed in the penultimate section of Good Energy. Means recommends eating minimally processed and mostly organic foods, and taking regular cold plunges or showers. (In her newsletter, she also advises Americans to grow the majority of their food; instead of pets, they could “raise chickens and goats and have abundant eggs and milk.”) She includes checklists upon checklists of habits and tests that “enable Good Energy” (and recommends getting a comprehensive lab panel from Function Health, of which she was an investor). She suggests buying a glucose monitor through her own company, Levels, and also recommends various personal-care apps, water filters, and trackers for sleep, food, and activity. Some of these items are sold by the wellness company True Medicine, which helps customers use their health savings account for a wide range of purchases, and in which Means has invested; her brother co-founded it. According to financial disclosures made public in September, Means has also received more than $275,000 from supplement companies. (Means has pledged to divest from True Medicine and other wellness interests if she is confirmed.)

Besides potentially boosting her own bottom line, Means’s embrace of individualism in health is wholly unrealistic. Americans work longer hours than people in many other developed nations, and many don’t have enough time to cook dinner, let alone raise goats. Many of the most important nutrition victories over the past century, such as the fortification of foods and the removal of trans fats, were communal and systemic, Klatt, the dietitian and UC Berkeley researcher, told me—the type of science-backed, population-level interventions that Means hasn’t demonstrated much interest in. A different prospective surgeon general might recommend repeated visits with a dietitian and fight for insurance to cover them, instead of “advocating for this kind of woo-woo stuff that has no data behind it,” Klatt said. Means, though, “is not an individual who seems to be wedded to the scientific process,” Timothy Caulfield, a professor and the research director at the Health Law Institute at the University of Alberta, told me. “This is someone who seems to pull things out of thin air and then look for sciencey-sounding rhetoric” to support them.

Perhaps Means’s eventual confirmation hearing will clarify what, exactly, she intends to do as the face of American public health. But even she may not be sure. “The future of medicine will be about light,” Means wrote to her newsletter subscribers last year, before admitting, “I don’t exactly know how yet.”</div>

            <h2>What Iranians Want From Trump</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-01-20</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/international/2026/01/trump-khamenei-iran-protests/685680/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">When Shahrzad went to demonstrate in the streets of Tehran on January 2, she was buoyed by one fact: The day before, President Trump had promised that if Iran killed protesters, “the United States of America will come to their rescue.”

“We were all so hopeful,” the 29-year-old woman, who left Iran a few days ago for a nearby country, told me. Like many of those I spoke with for this article, she used a pseudonym for fear of reprisals against her family. “But when Khamenei started threatening us the day after, we were shit-scared. What if they came to a deal with Trump over our heads?”

In the two weeks since, the Iranian regime has committed its biggest atrocity since the 1980s, killing at least 3,919 protesters, according to the U.S.-based Human Rights Activist News Agency. Trump has yet to act on his promises, though he has repeated them several times. Many hope he might still intervene. But Trump has also disheartened Iranians by downplaying the regime’s violence. On Friday, he puzzlingly thanked Iran’s leaders for allegedly halting their planned execution of 800 protesters.

Over the years, I’ve often sought the opinion of Iranians for or against foreign intervention. And it has long been a contentious question that’s sharply divided the opponents of the Islamic Republic. But posing this question to about a dozen Iranians in recent days has yielded answers that feel strikingly new. First, most of those I spoke with favored one form or another of intervention by the United States. Second, many favored what would have been unthinkable not long ago: for Trump to take out Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei.

Melika, a 21-year-old Iranian student in Europe who left Iran a few weeks ago, strongly opposed the Israeli-American attacks on Iran last year. A socialist feminist who took part in the “Women, Life, Freedom” protests of 2022–23, she is generally skeptical of foreign intervention. But faced with the regime’s brutal violence over the past two weeks, she now can’t help but favor some kind of action from the U.S., especially given that Trump promised it.

“I’d frankly like Trump to kill Khamenei,” she told me. “I am worried about a broader war that would hurt Iran’s infrastructure. I wouldn’t like for us to become an Iraq, happy that Saddam is gone but becoming worse. But the Islamic Republic has to pay a price.” She speculated that killing Khamenei could heighten the power struggle inside the regime and perhaps stanch the repression and killing of protesters.

Mahsa Alimardani: How doubt became a weapon in Iran

Shahrzad told me that many of those who protested with her agreed. “The people of Iran would like to see a Venezuela-style operation,” she said, “even if it seems like a strange demand for Iran.”

She struggled to maintain her composure as we spoke. Two of her friends were killed last week, along with nine others known to her broader friend circle.

The sentiments of these young activists are shared by some internationally renowned opponents of the Iranian regime several decades their senior. The Nobel Peace Prize laureate Shirin Ebadi, the celebrated filmmaker Mohsen Makhmalbaf, the scholar Mohammad Javad Akbarin, and four others issued an open letter calling for what they termed a “humanitarian intervention.”

Akbarin is a supporter of Mir Hossein Mousavi, the former prime minister of the Islamic Republic whose reformist candidacy for the presidency touched off the 2009 Green Movement. Mousavi has been under house arrest since 2011. Until a few years ago, for someone from his political corner to demand an American hit on Khamenei would have been unthinkable. But Akbarin, now based in London, told me: “Ali Khamenei’s elimination is a necessary condition for any change in Iran. If he stays in power, more people will be killed following the next protests.”

Akbarin opposes wider measures, such as striking the bases of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, as Israel did in June. But he believes that taking out Khamenei would open a path for change, preferably led by domestic elements in Iran. “It will help us enter the transition period,” he said.

Gal Beckerman: The silence of the Left on Iran

Mostafa Saber, a Vancouver-based leader of a prominent left-wing Iranian party, does not share many political views with Akbarin but agreed with him on this point. “Regardless of what I think, many people in Iran want support from Trump,” he told me by phone. “They’d like him to hit Khamenei. This is what the people want. And if he does, this can benefit the revolution.”

Saber, too, doubts the utility of American military engagement beyond such an operation. “A broader military attack will help the Islamic Republic and hurt the revolution,” he said. “We oppose such intervention. An all-out war will surely benefit the Islamic Republic. They will militarize the atmosphere.”

He pointed to this past summer’s 12-day war with the U.S. and Israel, which paused domestic actions, such as a nationwide truck-driver strike that was then under way. “But to take out Khamenei,” as Trump did with the IRGC leader Qassem Soleimani, “is a different matter,” he said. “Khamenei’s loss will take cohesion out of the Islamic Republic and will add to the people’s morale.”

Some activists have a different view of what sort of action Trump should take, however. Ali Vakili, an activist in New York City with extensive contacts in Iran, expressed reservations about an American hit on Khamenei. The supreme leader “shouldn’t be a martyr,” Vakili told me. “The people of Iran should decide his fate themselves.”

Vakili told me that he’d rather see the U.S. hit IRGC bases, and that “U.S. jets should remain in Iranian skies for a while” so that people might feel that the United States is really behind them. Maybe such a threat could force the regime to change its behavior—or even lead it to transition Khamenei and those close to him out of power in favor of more technocratic elements.

The consensus for foreign intervention among those I spoke with was wider spread and more politically diverse than ever before, in my experience, but it was by no means unanimous. Elahe Ejbari, a student activist who fled Iran in 2022, started a counterpetition to the one that Ebadi and Akbarin signed. Ejbari’s petition supports the people’s movement against the regime but declares that “tying the destiny of Iranian popular struggles to foreign intervention is dangerous and irresponsible.”

Arash Azizi: Change may be coming to Iran

“History shows us that foreign intervention in the global South will never lead to freedom,” she told me by phone from Germany. Even a direct hit on Khamenei, she said, “will only make the region more insecure.”

Another statement, signed by 14 luminaries including the popular journalist and scholar Alireza Rajaee, condemns both the regime’s violence and “any foreign intervention in our dear country Iran.” It warns that unless “fundamental peaceful change” is brought about by Iran’s rulers, “more difficult changes will become inevitable.”

Ultimately, Iran’s next chapter will be the outcome not only of what America does or does not do but also of the interactions among regional actors, protesters, and the regime’s web of factions. How these will unfold is all but impossible to predict.

But one thing is clear. Until a few years ago, millions of Iranians repeatedly voted in the country’s mostly unfree elections, hoping that regime insiders could pave a path for reform. They wouldn’t have dreamed of demanding change from American bombers or drones, or of asking the U.S. president to please kill the supreme leader for them.

Khamenei’s obstinate refusal to effect any meaningful change and his bloody massacre of civilians in droves have brought Iranians to this point. The grand ayatollah has brought them only death, disaster, and misery, and so they are desperately seeking a way out—by any means necessary.</div>

            <h2>Trump’s Attack on Democracy Is Faltering</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-01-20</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/2026/01/american-democracy-signs-life/685678/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The past year has been an annus horribilis for American democracy. Donald Trump launched an assault on any source of authority besides himself—prosecuting his political enemies, punishing dissenters both in and out of government, and following his own impulses regardless of law or norms. As the first year of Trump’s second term drew to a close, the administration launched an operation to arrest the Venezuelan strongman Nicolás Maduro without bothering to seek congressional assent, doubled down on its obsession with seizing Greenland, and proclaimed “absolute immunity” for the ICE agent who shot and killed Renee Nicole Good in Minneapolis. Top experts in authoritarianism now contend that America can no longer be characterized as a democracy.

And yet, the prognosis for democracy in the United States is far better today than it was at the start of Trump’s second term, when Elon Musk’s DOGE was stripping the federal government for parts and even normally sober observers began talking seriously about the constitutional crises that would follow if Trump defied the Supreme Court. Since then, American democracy has started to show signs of life: The popularity Trump enjoyed after the election has vanished, protesters have marched in record numbers to oppose his one-man rule, and citizens have shown up to defend their neighbors from immigration enforcement and other federal forces. That bravery has helped encourage opposition politicians to take more and more forceful stands. District judges, meanwhile, continue to throw up roadblocks to the president’s plans.

None of this means that American democracy as we know it will survive—especially given the threat of Trump’s potential interference in the 2026 and 2028 elections—but it has a pulse. As Trump’s term goes on, the administration appears less capable of establishing durable authoritarian rule, and the possibility that the nation will find a way through the chaos with self-government intact no longer seems quite as remote. “In normal liberal democracy terms, the United States is in bad shape,” the international-relations scholar Nicholas Grossman wrote recently. But, he went on, considering that the country is struggling against an attempted authoritarian takeover, “we’re doing pretty well.”

Jonathan Lemire: Trump is suddenly looking a lot smaller

Some of Trump’s troubles are of his own making: He pushed too far, too fast. During his first term, the president found himself stymied by aides and civil servants who tried to limit the damage caused by his whims. He learned his lesson—this time around, he has staffed his administration with sycophants eager to cast out anyone who objects. Yet this assault on professionalism has also undermined Trump’s ability to get what he wants, because nobody left will tell him that what he wants is impossible, deeply unpopular, or both. Vox’s Zack Beauchamp describes this mode of governance as “haphazardism,” a form of authoritarianism that is “poorly executed and even self-undermining.”

Consider Trump’s attempt to bring meritless criminal cases against his political opponents, a longtime desire blocked by Justice Department leadership during his first term. This time, Attorney General Pam Bondi has gone along with efforts to prosecute former FBI Director James Comey and New York Attorney General Letitia James—but the department handled the cases so sloppily that a district court has already thrown them out. Courts have barred similarly slapdash efforts to appoint a slate of Trump-friendly prosecutors, harass law firms the president dislikes, withhold federal funding from a range of institutions, and deploy the National Guard to peaceful cities despite opposition from blue-state governors. That said, judicial defiance has been more pronounced in the lower courts. The Supreme Court has proved disturbingly willing to rubber-stamp the administration’s actions, with the exception of its recent ruling barring Trump’s use of the National Guard.

The administration similarly overreached with its campaign to oust Jimmy Kimmel from his late-night ABC spot over a joke about the Republican Party’s eagerness to use Charlie Kirk’s death to “score political points.” Federal Communications Commission Chairman Brendan Carr was too enthusiastic in publicly pressuring Disney, ABC’s parent company, to suspend Kimmel’s show. The heavy-handedness provoked a public backlash, and Disney, faced with skyrocketing rates of subscription cancellations, reinstated the late-night host. On immigration enforcement—Trump’s signature issue—the brutality and clumsiness of the mass-deportation campaign has decreased public support for the president’s agenda and increased the number of Americans who strongly disapprove of ICE.

As Trump began to struggle, the opposition found its voice. His military parade in June was countered by millions of protesters who gathered at “No Kings” demonstrations across the country and returned again in October for what may have been the largest single-day protest in American history. With the National Guard and immigration enforcement moving from city to city, residents—including people not typically among the ranks of demonstrators—have developed and shared tactics of opposition to protect their neighbors. “I’ve never protested in my life,” one man who gathered with others on a Minneapolis street told the freelance reporter Zach D. Roberts.

These are the kind of losses that a would-be dictator still in the early stages of establishing a regime simply can’t afford. Successful contemporary authoritarians, such as Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán, tend to ride into office on a wave of popular support and then shore up those high approval ratings while chipping away at governing institutions. By the time a substantial portion of the public wants to stop them, it’s too late. Trump, though, lacks both the self-control required to move slowly and the connection to reality required to understand what is and isn’t popular outside his most committed base. He seems to particularly enjoy the aesthetics of authoritarianism, delighting in the spectacle of armed National Guard members descending on a liberal-leaning city—but those aesthetics are repulsive to many Americans. Likewise, his obsession with tariffs has contributed to economic discontent and dragged down his approval ratings as voters continue to complain about inflation.

Early in 2025, scholars were horrified by how forcefully Trump appeared to be speeding through the process of establishing authoritarian rule—more quickly than almost any contemporary dictator. It turns out that there might be a reason the other rulers moved more slowly.

Together, these factors create a virtuous cycle of sorts. Trump’s malice and incompetence alienates voters, who then publicly voice their discontent, encouraging other political actors and institutions to see him not as a crusading avatar of national destiny but as a weakened figure. The law firms that caved early to Trump have suffered from a loss of talent and business, a development that may encourage other firms to fight back. Many news organizations have continued their aggressive reporting on the administration despite threats to the freedom of the press.

Although Trump remains the dominant force in the Republican Party, he no longer wields the iron authority he once did. He has withdrawn a record number of nominations—a tacit admission that his administration lacked the votes to force them through the Senate—and failed to persuade Congress to maintain devastating cuts to government services. Meanwhile, Democratic politicians such as Illinois Governor J. B. Pritzker and California Governor Gavin Newsom are taking up the cause of opposition to Trump. After Trump’s inauguration, conventional wisdom portrayed that kind of resistance as a political dead end. Today, however, ambitious leaders understand the approach as one that could boost them to higher office. This enthusiasm surged after Democratic candidates overperformed in November’s off-year elections. “The period of despair is over,” announced Democratic Senator Jon Ossoff of Georgia after the results were tallied. But, he said, the fight had to continue: “The only way out is victory in the midterms.”

From the November 2025 issue: America needs a mass movement—now

Trump is now in a bind. To avoid accountability for his abuses, he desperately needs the Republican Party to hold on to both houses of Congress in 2026 (“If we don’t win the midterms,” he said recently, “I’ll get impeached”). And yet he refuses to back down from the authoritarian strategies that are sinking his popularity and Republicans’ odds, especially in the House. The more unpopular he becomes, the less effective his efforts to hack his way into a midterm victory will be. His plan to bully red-state Republican-led legislatures into mid-decade redistricting to wipe out Democratic seats is floundering; GOP legislators in Indiana and Kansas rejected his demands, and blue-state Democrats have countered through gerrymanders of their own. And his declining poll numbers also increase the chances that Democrats take the House by a significant enough margin that Trump would have no real means of upending the election results through claims of fraud.

None of this is reassuring, exactly. Trump’s second term has been defined by his inability to respond to setbacks in any way except escalation, and the turbulent first few weeks of 2026 are a reminder of just how dangerous that instinct can be. As the political writer Jonathan Bernstein put it, Trump’s presidency “is somehow both getting much stronger and much weaker at the same time”—stronger, in the sense that he acts more aggressively when he can; weaker, in the sense that those expressions of pique further box him in politically. Facing a growing and galvanized opposition, and with fewer and fewer options for shoring up his authority, Trump may have already squandered his chance to build a post-democratic America. The question now is how much damage he can do in his waning years of power.</div>

            <h2>Why So Many Writers Are Athletes</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-01-20</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/books/2026/01/writing-exercise-movement-creativity/685634/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">For someone who is not a professional swimmer, I spend an awful lot of time under water. I consider it an act of mobile meditation: Sensory input is muffled, so the chaos of the surface world eventually recedes. What’s left is activity—familiar, comforting, and hypnotic, almost second nature. My brain, normally trying to create order out of chaos, is free to fumble for deeper meaning. This is especially useful as a writer: I believe I generate my best material while swimming.

But, as I discovered several years ago when I was working on a book about swimming, one can’t actually write about the experience in the moment. Sometimes, I found myself rushing from the pool to the locker room. With water puddling at my feet, I’d struggle with damp fingers to unlock my phone and tap out the lines that had appeared in my head while I was gliding through the lanes. I have notebooks splotched with water stains and running ink, testaments to this repeated effort to capture quicksilver.

In the years since writing that book, I’ve come to realize that swimming, and exertion more generally, is intimately tied to how I approach the creative act. This makes sense: I’ve reported on exercise and athletes for years, and I’m familiar with the science that examines how movement changes our brains. Moving while reading, listening, or writing activates a unique mode of learning (a similar distinction can be found in handwriting versus typing). And exercise specifically boosts neurotransmitters such as dopamine, serotonin, and noradrenaline; it immediately improves our ability to pay attention. Movement also shakes loose new connections: It’s been associated with both better creative cognition and an increase in the originality and fluency of ideas.

Still, I didn’t think about the ways this holds true for other writers until a recent conversation I had with the novelist Jade Chang; she pointed me to the acknowledgments in her new novel, What a Time to Be Alive, in which she thanks her Pilates studio. Was this tongue-in-cheek? Partially, Chang told me, but movement was crucial to her process. “Exhausting the body was good prep for spending hours being so cerebral and still,” she said. The intensity of the workout was necessary to take her out of her head, so that she could write from a different place—“an embodied place, because writing is not just intellectual; it’s emotional connection, sensual connection,” she explained. “We exist in the world.”

In other words, we’re built to move. I started asking other writers I knew whether exercise felt similarly entwined with their work. Recently, the writer and comedian Chris Duffy and I went surfing together, and we chatted in the lulls between swells. “Sitting in the ocean waiting for a wave is the exact same skill as sitting at my computer with the white noise on, waiting for a joke to come,” he said. The same held true when he was putting together his recently published book, Humor Me. (The white-noise sound he writes to? The ocean.)

Movement keeps us grounded in the sensory details of the landscapes we inhabit, and asks us to pay close attention to what it really feels like to do the thing. The writer Ivy Pochoda, who is a former professional squash champion, told me that the euphoria of playing made it into her recent novel, Ecstasy, which is about dance and focuses heavily on the idea of stepping outside of yourself. “When you’re in the zone playing, you almost have an out-of-body experience,” Pochoda said on the phone from the airport, on her way to watch her daughter play in a squash tournament. “It’s like that thing David Foster Wallace wrote about playing tennis—that you’re more coordinated than God.”

The body is an important part of the learning process: Research shows that “moving your foot and understanding the word ‘kick’ are governed by similar areas of the motor cortex,” the cognitive scientist Sian Beilock writes. “It’s hard to separate the reading mind from the doing one.” In that vein, the journalist Harrison Hill told me that when he was in the thick of writing his upcoming book, The Oracle’s Daughter, about an American cult, he’d go on long runs and listen to interviews with sources so he could “go to the page without rifling through notes or scrubbing back through the audio.” When it came time to write, he felt he already held the stories in his bones. They were now his to tell.

Joyce Carol Oates once described running as an act in which “the mind flies with the body; the mysterious efflorescence of language seems to pulse in the brain, in rhythm with our feet and the swinging of our arms.” Not long ago, I spent an afternoon browsing at a used bookstore in Berkeley, California, where I live. As I wove through the stacks of aging books, I thought about the tradition of writers relying on physical activity. Goethe, I’d learned, was one of them; as he got older, he came to dislike sitting at a desk and had to walk around while writing. Nietzsche said the same, criticizing Flaubert and the sedentary life—das sitzfleisch, literally “sitting meat”—as anathema to creative thought.

Writers have long been chasing that dopamine hit. Virginia Woolf tramped along the Cornish coast; Oliver Sacks was known to swim; Haruki Murakami is an accomplished runner. These patterns aren’t unique to idiosyncratic writers: Movement loosens something within all of us. Physical practice is not just a break from sitting at a desk—it is explicit and essential, an extra twist to open the tap, allowing for a freer flow from the faucet of thought.

In “Street Haunting,” Woolf’s evocative essay about a wintry walk across London, the restless, lonely writer leaves home, ostensibly to buy a pencil. But her journey is long and meandering. In the middle of a crowd, Woolf begins observing faces and professions, picking out individuals. “Into each of these lives one could penetrate a little way, far enough to give oneself the illusion that one is not tethered to a single mind but can put on briefly for a few minutes the bodies and minds of others,” she writes. She imagines the thoughts of a street singer, or a laundress; then she begins following the tracks she dreams up for them, hoping to “leave the straight lines of personality and deviate into those footpaths that lead beneath brambles and thick tree trunks” where she might locate their true selves. And as she puts her finger out to take the pulse of life, her own thoughts follow. At the end, Woolf admits that the pencil was an excuse to roam. The walk frees her; it makes her work possible.

Of course, not every writer links their art to movement so explicitly. But even those who aren’t totally committed to exercise notice its value and the way it shows up in finished work. The journalist Heather Radke, for instance, is working on a book about American girlhood; she told me that Louisa May Alcott “took a run” every day while she was writing Little Women. Radke said she’s “always jealous of the writers who were also athletes in the past.” When I go back to Alcott’s novel, I fall headlong into a vivid passage in which Laurie advises Jo to race him down a hill so that she won’t feel so wretched about the idea of Meg getting married. He watches with satisfaction as she comes “panting up with flying hair, bright eyes, ruddy cheeks, and no signs of dissatisfaction in her face.” Jo has a ready remark: “I wish I was a horse, then I could run for miles in this splendid air, and not lose my breath.”

Jo, being a writer as well as a runaway from the strictures of womanhood, is a bit of an avatar for Alcott. Life, as I see it, is a series of galloping rhythms. To know that this coming-of-age classic was conjured from bouts of exercise is delightful, and somehow it comes as no surprise at all.

Most days, my own feet are at the edge of the ocean by first light. As dawn reaches its pink fingers across the sky, I paddle my surfboard out into the Pacific. Sometimes, there is nothing but noticing in my head: the light; the seals, bobbing and watchful; the next set out on the horizon. Other times, a problem bubbles up as I arrive—my movements on the wave twitchy and inelegant, mirroring my state of mind—only to recede as my body finds its cadence, in concert with the water. If all goes well, I’m back at my desk with wet hair by the time my family comes downstairs. The weighted-blanket feeling of muscles used well allows me to sit comfortably in stillness. My mind is clear; I turn on the tap.

I didn’t thank my swimming pool in my book’s acknowledgments, but I know now that I should have. If I don’t swim, if I don’t surf, if I don’t flow, the words won’t, either. There’s a permeability between the practices of writing and moving; one discipline informs the other. In that meeting, everything expands.

            <h2>Trump’s Golden Age of Culture Seems Pretty Sad So Far</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-01-20</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/2026/01/trump-one-year-culture/685643/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Sparklers sizzled, boom-badoom-boom bass thumped, and Nicki Minaj emerged onstage at Turning Point USA’s AmericaFest last month to deliver the latest plot twist in an exhausting year for politics and pop culture. The rapper—whose straight black hair reached the hem of her sleek minidress—sat down with Charlie Kirk’s widow, Erika Kirk, who sported medieval-princess blond braids and waves. Then Minaj tore into previous presidential administrations for being un-Christian and uncool. “We can’t let people like that be in power, you guys,” she said, flaring her eyes like she does in the video for her song “Stupid Hoe.”

Minaj arrived in America at age 5 as an undocumented immigrant from Trinidad, and is still not, she said in 2024, an American citizen. Her music uses pornographic profanity to assert herself as a man-eating empress, and her fans—many of them queer—don pink wigs and call themselves “Barbz,” after Barbie. Yet here she was at a conference co-founded by Charlie Kirk, a defender of traditional gender roles who just last year called Minaj a poor role model for young Black women. Here she was, praising Donald Trump as the handsome redeemer of American pride.

Ever since the president danced with the Village People during last year’s inauguration weekend, the Trumpian right has been disorienting America with this kind of spectacle. Trolling and tackiness, often crossbred with left-coded pop songs and hot memes, have served to wish a new zeitgeist into existence. Consume only the output of MAGA’s multi-front media efforts, and you may come to feel that the country is coalescing into pep-rally unity on Trump’s behalf. Minaj’s appearance at the Turning Point event gave the right a trophy to flaunt, signaling who the popular kids really are.

Any follower of Minaj’s knows what’s behind this kind of bravado. Like the killer doll Chucky, which she often references, or perhaps like Elon Musk wielding a chainsaw, her persona—big grin, nasty words—conveys cheerful cruelty. But it’s a performance of embattlement, not dominance—the offensive defense of someone everyone thinks of as “the bad guy,” per her song “Chun-Li.” She constantly seems beset by haters, rivals, and (in recent years) a public that doesn’t stream her music as much as she demands. Seeing her onstage drove home the desperation that has also defined MAGA’s imagery this past year, whether the example was ICE arrests turned into adorable anime or recruitment posters drawn in the same pastoral style as 1930s Germany. The president’s aesthetics are wackily fascist—but American culture, for now, remains peskily democratic.

Trump’s return to office was widely portrayed as christening a new definition of chic. Young voters and voters of color had swung in his direction, thanks partly to the influence of podcasts, livestreams, and other media formats that now compete with traditional news outlets and cultural institutions. The attendance of tech barons, comedians, and content creators at Trump’s inauguration indicated that the so-called alternative media was now the mainstream—and openly pro-Trump. Its touchstones appeared to be recently booming phenomena including country music, TikTok tradwives, and mixed martial arts.

Trump quickly began consolidating his cultural power by focusing on the old media that hadn’t fallen in line. He strong-armed news networks, intervened in Hollywood mergers, overtook and renamed the Kennedy Center, slashed public-broadcasting budgets, and recast the White House press corp. These efforts have borne results: sycophantic press conferences, DEI rollbacks at movie studios, a news chief at CBS whose nightly broadcast has delivered a “salute” to Marco Rubio and spent a mere 16 seconds covering the fifth anniversary of January 6.

These authoritarian-scented measures, combined with MAGA’s apparent command of new media, gestured at what Trump really needed to achieve his full agenda: cultural pacification and control. His policies are, however else you describe them, disruptive. Mass deporting migrants, brazenly axing federal grants and jobs, pursuing an inflationary trade war, risking the lives of soldiers to trouble the sovereignty of hemispheric neighbors—these things are shaking the everyday lives of Americans. Seeking a third term, as he has hinted at doing, would redefine the presidency itself. Such drastic measures should mean, in a free and open democracy, powerful pushback vented not only through the political process but also through artists and audiences.

Outcry has, indeed, resulted—though less of it, and less sharply rendered, than one might expect. Trump’s first term spurred the indefatigable and angry Resistance, with its mocking “tiny hands” imagery and battalion of celebrities. This time, the popular protest movement is “No Kings,” which has made a point of presenting itself as a vague and upbeat pro-democracy effort. Once-outspoken entertainers have been a bit quieter of late as well. The actor Jennifer Lawrence told The New York Times that the past decade has discouraged her from using her platform for politics.

The animated pushback to ICE in Minneapolis over recent weeks marks a return to a more confrontational style of protest. But the situation in that city has also demonstrated MAGA’s methods for stigmatizing dissent. The death of the activist Renee Nicole Good at the hands of an immigration agent has been justified on the right in a fashionable tone of detachment. The right-wing pundit Erick Erickson labeling Good an “AWFUL”—an Affluent White Female Urban Liberal—stereotypes the opposition as not just wrongheaded but cringe, so cringe it doesn’t matter at all.

Yet, in important ways, the cultural feedback loop remains intact and significant. Take the Jimmy Kimmel incident. In September, the talk-show host seemed to imply, incorrectly, that Kirk’s killer was a MAGA supporter. The Federal Communications Commission chair, Brendan Carr, threatened ABC, Kimmel’s network, which announced his show’s indefinite removal from its time slot. The ensuing outcry from the public, including from alt-media figures such as Joe Rogan, was deafening, and Kimmel quickly returned to the air. One lesson from that episode: Whatever motives underlay ABC’s initial decision, they were not powerful enough to justify the mess it caused.

Another lesson is that the same ecosystem that helped elect Trump is also independent from him. Rogan, the superstar podcaster credited with helping sway the 2024 election, has not only griped about Kimmel; he’s also questioned the White House’s immigration crackdown and tariffs. Andrew Schulz, another popular comedian and podcaster, declared that Trump’s foreign policy and spending bills are “the exact opposite of everything I voted for.” The streamer Adin Ross, who gave Trump a car during the 2024 campaign, now says he regrets ever talking politics, because it’s had the effect of tarnishing his brand.

None of these figures has exactly gone blue, but their griping is in line with what polls have shown about Trump’s softening support among young people, men, and people of color. His appeal to those groups in 2024, it seems, was rooted in something other than stereotypical MAGA loyalty. The “freethinking” moniker that Rogan and others give themselves can seem risible—they’re so freethinking that they’re willing to entertain conspiracy theories and superstition—but it does, in fact, have some basis in truth.

And though the government can threaten the licenses of news networks, the internet is more difficult to tame. To be sure, Musk’s overhaul of X to make it friendlier to white nationalists, Mark Zuckerberg’s rollback of Meta’s moderation regime, and TikTok’s Trump-assisted sale to a group of investors led by the conservative billionaire Larry Ellison all suggest the extent to which web culture can be shaped and distorted by its platforms. But a podcaster is still just someone with a mic and an audience. Short of outright criminalizing dissent or resorting to mafioso intimidation—neither out of the question—Trump has no simple recourse against the online crowd other than the one he has always had, the one that politicians in a democracy are supposed to use: persuasion.

One person who understood persuasion was Charlie Kirk, whose killing might be the most culturally consequential development of the past year. Kirk grasped how the internet has changed America, but his death has demonstrated—and, disturbingly, may have resulted from—the fundamentally anarchic nature of those changes.

Kirk rose to prominence by bridging the roles of activist, influencer, and party spokesman in a manner that connected with young people and shaped consensus on the right. In early 2025, he helped diminish GOP opposition to RFK Jr.’s confirmation as health secretary by vowing to organize primary challengers. He later downplayed the delayed release of the Jeffrey Epstein files by saying he held “trust” in his “friends in the government to do what needs to be done”—a position that only someone who’d himself accrued enormous trust from his followers could possibly maintain.

After Kirk’s death, all sorts of narratives started to break down. For example, his alleged killer, Tyler Robinson, is a highly online young, white, male video gamer—which is to say, he is the kind of person who was thought to be driving America’s conservative wave. But according to evidence cited by police, he saw Kirk as a font of “hate.” Immediately after the shooting, he logged on to the social network Discord to chat with his friends, suggesting that he was performing for the sort of micro-audience upon which the nation’s fragmented culture is now built. (Robinson has not yet entered a plea of guilt or innocence.)

Kirk’s allies quickly tried to tell a new story—one of Kirk as sacred martyr. When others questioned that portrayal by citing Kirk’s more callous stances—on immigrants, guns, and trans people—Trump saw an opportunity to further pursue his anti-dissent agenda. His administration began labeling liberal advocacy groups as terrorists. J. D. Vance encouraged the punishment of anyone seen celebrating Kirk’s death. At least 600 people were subsequently fired from their jobs for social-media posts and public statements, some of which extolled the murder and some of which just quoted the victim’s own words.

But months later, the campaign to sanctify Kirk appears to have backfired in some ways. Gen Z and Gen Alpha’s highly ironic meme ecosystem has embraced what’s called “Kirkification”: the use of AI to meld Kirk’s face with all sorts of characters—superheroes, rappers, porn actors. The intentions of the Kirkifiers vary wildly. Some meme makers are admirers of Kirk who want to valorize him; some are neo-Nazis out to mock Kirk for not being extreme enough (while also drawing attention to their cause); some are liberals trying to troll conservatives; many are surely apolitical types having a nonsensical laugh. In most cases, the effect is to flout any top-down insistence on reverence, a party line, or a unified myth.

The assassination of Trump’s best mouthpiece also destabilized the online right. With Kirk gone, doubts and disagreements about Israel, tariffs, and—the big one—Epstein have spun out in a variety of directions. They’ve been stoked by a class of influencer pundits, such as Candace Owens and Nick Fuentes, who are angling to fill the cultural vacuum left by Kirk. But unlike him, they profess no particular fealty to a party establishment. They are moving by the logic of online entertainment, which, at this moment, is driven by demand for conspiracy theories and conflict—in opposition, at times, to MAGA itself.

Meanwhile, traditional opposition has been enduring a demoralization campaign via federally funded trolling. Stunts such as taking over the Kennedy Center and snarkily relabeling presidential portraits should be understood partly as efforts to exhaust opponents while letting supporters feel like they’re in on a joke. The maxims “Don’t feed the trolls” and “Don’t take the bait” can seem like enlightened responses—but in effect, they serve Trump’s need for cultural pacification.

Perhaps this is why the administration has taken the bizarre step of actively seeking confrontations with celebrities. Government-run social-media accounts have been posting political “fancams”—highlight reels that stans make to celebrate their obsessions—set to music and sounds by popular entertainers. One video pairs photos of Trump with the swooning sound of a Taylor Swift song; another mashes up a video snippet of the comedian Theo Von and shots of immigrants getting deported.

These clips work on the level of propaganda by portraying Trump’s agenda as swashbuckling and hip. But they also create ultimatums for entertainers. Should stars who object to the use of their work publicly complain—as did Von, a Trump-friendly podcaster who nevertheless didn’t like being associated with the immigration crackdowns? Or should they stay above the fray—as has Swift, a onetime Trump critic whose silence on politics over the past year has unnerved some of her fans? Or should they go meta—as did the singer SZA, who wrote on X that the administration was “rage baiting artists for free promo”?

Complaining certainly seems like a headache. In December, in another video, Sabrina Carpenter’s puppy-love anthem “Juno” was paired with deportation imagery. In response, the singer posted, “This video is evil and disgusting. Do not ever involve me or my music to benefit your inhumane agenda.” The White House then shot back a statement that referenced her lyrics, asking whether she was “stupid” or “slow.” When Variety asked the government about its use of Swift’s music, a spokesperson said, “We made this video because we knew fake-news media brands like Variety would breathlessly amplify them. Congrats, you got played.”

Obnoxiousness like that is probably best understood as an attempt at reverse psychology. The administration’s fancam videos generate millions of views, and many attempts to not “amplify” Trump have only proved counterproductive. To a casual internet scroller, seeing these videos circulate without controversy might imply acquiescence from the performers featured in them. And acquiescence can be contagious. In other words, the administration may be systematically testing cultural figures out of the understanding that they still hold sway. They can still speak out, and it still matters if they do, or if they don’t. So they probably should.

As for Minaj, she’s an example of what MAGA leaders likely dream of gaining from their trolling efforts: support. The rapper began her open flirtation with the right in November by reposting an official White House video that used one of her songs. After she publicly expressed concern about reports of persecution of Christians in Nigeria, the administration brought her to address a United Nations panel on the topic. Soon she was writing on X that Trump and Vance were “the good guys,” and she started feuding with Gavin Newsom.

During Trump’s first administration, Minaj expressed horror at his immigration policies. Theories now abound as to what changed since she said, in 2020, that she’s “not gonna jump on the Donald Trump bandwagon.” One common explanation is that she’s shopping for a pardon for her husband, who was convicted of attempted rape in 1995. Others point out that she has alienated much of the music industry by feuding with liberal stars including Jay-Z, Cardi B, and Megan Thee Stallion. Jay-Z is the head of the team that programs the Super Bowl halftime show; might Minaj want to headline Turning Point USA’s alternative halftime show?

But maybe her conversion is genuine. As she talked onstage with Erika Kirk, Minaj’s voice ached while she described her own journey with Christianity. She was raised as a devout churchgoer, lapsed in her faith as she rose to stardom, and now wants to come back into the fold. I thought of Little Richard, Prince, Ye, and other colorful, crass pop predecessors of Minaj’s who were shaped by the church in early life and turned to conservative Christianity in midlife. Maybe Minaj is undergoing a very normal journey for someone like her—simply at an abnormal time in American history.

When I opened up social media after her Turning Point appearance, my feeds were full of Barbz renouncing their membership in what had been the most loyal and fervent of all pop fandoms. I saw Minaj sparring with critics and critics sparring with one another. I had the strange thought that Minaj and the dustup around her is an example of the speech rights that have survived the past year—and I felt grateful for all of the competing forces and factions that remain too complex for politics to control.</div>

Well, it still can&#39;t pick apples or milk cows. It still can&#39;t clean your house or mow your lawn. You know, the kinds of jobs immigrants tend to do.

or mow your lawn.There are lawnmower bots, now.
Sure, it doesn&#39;t need AI for that at all... but I&#39;d scratch that one from the list.
We don&#39;t have Rosey the Robot yet, but I suspect that&#39;s not quite as far out as some of us imagine.

Picking apples- that one will be hard to replace.
Mechanized cow milking- very much a solved problem. Replacing the little human involvement in that wouldn&#39;t be difficult. I&#39;ve witnessed it. It&#39;s both kind of fucked up and fascinating at the same time.

There are a bunch of different apple-picking machines. We&#39;d have automated much more of agriculture if people couldn&#39;t hire illegals to do it for $5 an hour.

Rather like the Romans could have had an Industrial Revolution a thousand years early if they didn&#39;t have masses of cheap slaves to do the work.

The antisemite just checked in.  Now please check out.

Countries allow migration because it increases profits for the oligarchs and it provides more votes for politicians; if the people won&#39;t elect the politicians, the politicians will elect a new people.

The explanation of importing voters doesn&#39;t make sense. Most countries require an extended period of time for immigrants to become citizens. It takes decades for the new immigrants to become voters- long after the politicians are likely to be out of office. Besides that, there is no consistent voting pattern for new arrivals, nor is there any guarantee that immigrant communities will support pro-immigration politicians. For example, Cubans immigrant communities have consistently supported politicians with a

> Besides that, there is no consistent voting pattern for new arrivals

Why would Democrats import millions of foreigners if the majority would vote Republican?

Why did Reagan grant mass amnesty to immigrants in the 80s if he thought they were all going to vote for Democrats? Why did the Trump campaign target Cubans and Venezuelan immigrant communities if he thought they would be hostile to his message? Why did deportations spike under Obama if he thought he was deporting his future voters?

The fact of the matter is that the vast majority of politicians only care about the period when they are in political power. They don&#39;t think ahead to how today&#39;s children might

And yet this is literally what politicians have been doing across the West for decades. Import foreigners and promise to give free stuff and patronage to foreigners who vote for them.

It&#39;s not even necessarily about the votes themselves. Mail-in voting means there&#39;s no need for the foreigners to even turn up and vote, political parties can simply submit fake votes for them. And in the US it means more seats in Congress because

The first two sentences contradict each other, in my mind. Or perhaps he doesn&#39;t understand why mass immigration occurs.

Certainly the U.S. doesn&#39;t &quot;need&quot; mass immigration. Mass immigration occurs because there is greater opportunity here than elsewhere. AI eliminating jobs would more likely have a cooling effect on immigration because there would be less opportunity(jobs) here. But, even with less jobs, the opportunity for higher pay will attract a lot of immigration.

And, that doesn&#39;t bode well for domestic workers either. It only increases competition for those &quot;vocational&quot; jobs. Vocational jobs for which America&#39;s knowledge workers have no training, nor experience, nor desire for that matter. There&#39;s no one looking to abandon their office 9-5 to become a roofer for a quarter of the pay.

I do agree that high-level white collar positions, such as his, should be replaced by AI. They are certainly ripe or even ideal for AI replacement. But, as yet, we&#39;ve seen none of the rulers - CEOs and upper management - willing to cede their crowns to AI and I don&#39;t see why that would change.

Certainly the U.S. doesn&#39;t &quot;need&quot; mass immigration.

I am reading online all the time that the US would have no concerns with population decline if it just stopped being so racist and filled the gap with millions and millions of immigrants.

I am reading online all the time that the US would have no concerns with population decline if it just stopped being so racist and filled the gap with millions and millions of immigrants.A country can only accommodate new arrivals at a certain rate. Immigration has to be bound by that rate. The US needs immigrants. But it also needs to know who is coming, some background screening needs to be done, a health check needs to be done. We did such things at Ellis Island for many decades, allowing vast number to enter at the rate we could accommodate.

Ellis Island didn&#39;t really have much meaningful vetting. Basically anybody who could physically make it to the U.S. was allowed in provided they didn&#39;t have a dread disease that was easily identifiable based on the rudimentary medical knowledge of the time and wasn&#39;t some notorious anarchist. It&#39;s not like Ellis Island had full access to Irish or Italian criminal records and could do proper background checks.

Mass immigration could actually be done much better today. You could allow mass immigrants (not just

You should break out of your reading bubble. You&#39;re being misinformed and probably manipulated.

Mass immigration occurs because it&#39;s cheaper for oligarchs to hire foreigners than local people (and, to a lesser extent, because politicians need new voters).

There was never a need for mass immigration. It&#39;s just the modern, Woke version of slavery.

&quot;There&#39;s no one looking to abandon their office 9-5 to become a roofer for a quarter of the pay.&quot;

Minimum wage is $17.13 an hour in WA state. Roofers are eligible for time and a half too. There are other options as well,

&quot;The average salary for a electrician is $39.44 per hour in Washington State and $9,438 overtime per year.&quot;

If your job goes poof in a cloud of AI smoke you may not have a choice but to change careers. I had an involuntary change of  careers myself.

I have a colleague who is an electrician but decided to do a lower paying job as a helpdesk guy because while the pay was better, he wasn&#39;t uncomfortable with his arse being on the line for a mistake, however unlikely, which results in a fire.

When in history, has a new automation technology led to long-term poor outcomes for humans? Short term, yes, there have been job losses when farms were mechanized, when factories were automated, when factories replaced blacksmiths. But after a decade or two, things always reset to a new normal, a new normal which offers improved lives for everyone.

True true. So long as you aren&#39;t the generation that gets to suffer and die from the loss/change, it&#39;ll be roses and sunshine.

Fuck the legions of blacksmiths whose lives turned to misery and death came early.

I&#39;m sure that the next generation will fully appreciate your selfless sacrifice that made this bright present and futures possible.

Sounds like his argument is that we&#39;ll have so many out-of-work software engineers and customer service reps desperate to pick crops and nail shingles on roofs for $16/hour that we won&#39;t need migrant labor anymore.

Not sure that sounds like a very hopeful future....

This is nothing new from Karp. It&#39;s just using the buzzword of the day to help justify a policy he&#39;s always wanted for reasons that have nothing to do with modern technology.

And yet even this new anti-immigration rhetoric makes no sense. The whole point of immigration (from an economic standpoint) is to correct misallocations of skills between places. If Country A has a surplus of skilled electricians and country B has a deficit, it makes sense for country B to allow electricians from country B to immigrate. AI doesn&#39;t change that. His argument (in vouge among tech bros) is that there will be all of these out of work white collar people who can just train for blue-collar work. But real life doesn&#39;t work like that. An out of work 50 year old white collar worker isn&#39;t in a position to spend 10 years of apprenticeship and skills development to become a master electrician. When people are displaced by new technology, the cruel reality is most of them don&#39;t successfully retrain unless it happens very early in their career. Most of those out of work coal workers in West Virginia who were told to &quot;learn to code&quot; didn&#39;t actually succeed, and those who did are now looking at being displaced by AI.

The U.S. only exists as a country in the first place because of historic mass migration. Without ancient mass migration, it would still be a wilderness. Without more recent mass migration, it would probably be several nations arising from dozens of historic Native American tribes. Or do you suppose there was a specific point in history when mass migration was no longer acceptable?

Philosophy PhDs are workers?  Where?  Starbucks?  Or is it the tiny percent who go on to teach other philosophy students?

Now, don&#39;t get me wrong, I like philosophy.  I minored in it.  I was one of the top students in the department.  But it isn&#39;t a practical skill or field.  If anything, it gets in the way of practicality.  Karp is an outlier.

            <div id="article-text">Is this news because this happens often, or not often enough (the google manual death penalty)?

If people already knew about this site, wouldn&#39;t they keep going back to it?  Wouldn&#39;t they have the site bookmarked?

Not saying their traffic wouldn&#39;t go down, but if it was that &quot;popular&quot;, shouldn&#39;t the people who already know about it still viist?

I think you&#39;re sorely underestimating the amount of people that type &#39;Facebook&#39; in their address bar to reach fb.

Inside the /. bubble, sure, that makes sense.  But crypto badly wants to be mainstream and, demographically, it&#39;s a lot younger than this community is.  You might be surprised at how few people under 30 maintain bookmarks or consume news from specific outlets intentionally.

RTFA shows that the author of this opinion piece.

&quot;Jon Rice is the former editor-in-chief at Cointelegraph, Blockworks, and Crypto Briefing.&quot;

Which are the firms he is dunking on in the article.  Further quote:

&quot;Perhaps when media owners and operators begin to recognize that sidelining expertise often leads to the destruction of value, they’ll have a little more respect for the people in their organizations who actually understand the industry.&quot;

Just another facet of the exciting and totally not-sketch crypto-sphere.

Cointelegraph is apparently owned by Luna Media, a Dubai based VC.

Obviously prisons don&#39;t work for sick people - he should be locked up in a psycho ward.

It&#39;s gonna happen, I&#39;m just the messenger. Even if big nations ban it, small nations or private islands will pursue it because rich people want to tweak their babies and will bribe or buy governments to get it.

Khan: &quot;But Kirk, I can give you real hair so you don&#39;t have to wear dead tribbles anymore!&quot;

Khan will also have the captain&#39;s chair on the bridge reupholstered in fine, Corinthian leather.

Turns out there is no such thing as &quot;Corinthian leather&quot;, it&#39;s a marketing gimmick made up by Chrysler.

Come to the utopian city of Rapture [wikipedia.org]!  Where the artist does not fear the censor, where the scientist is not be bound by petty morality, where the great are not be constrained by the small!  Want to be stronger, faster, smarter? Plasmids are the key!  Book your flight now, use the promotion code GATTACA [wikipedia.org] for a 10% discount!

I know people have a kneejerk reaction to gene editing (see all the Gattaca references), but wouldn&#39;t getting rid of this debilitating affliction be a good thing?  Should we let the human population be afflicted with this?

If this guy would somehow find a way to edit out whatever it is that causes cancer, would people react the same way?

Maybe.The classic case is Sickle Cell, which protects against Malaria.Is eliminating Malaria a good thing?  Not if it means giving everyone Sickle Cell Anemia.Is Eliminating Sickle Cell Anemia a good thing?  Not if it means wide spread Malaria epidemics.

As a pro-technologist I&#39;m all for having the option to edit genes, but it&#39;s something that needs to be studied over generations to determine &quot;goodness&quot;.

Define &quot;somehow&quot; ... If a leading cancer scientist murders his wife because he didn&#39;t like the way she cooked his dinner, should they be put in jail? What if that scientist had gone on to cure cancer? Nobody on slashdot argued to let Hans Reiser off because he made a file system they liked. You can&#39;t justify a Dr. Mengele evading justice based on the outcome of their work, there must be consequences in society for people with callous disregard for human life even if there&#39;s a short term penalty.

One thing to point out. Regarding his previous attempt -- the edit didn&#39;t work perfectly. It&#39;s likely in my opinion that although the two kids will have a reduced risk of getting HIV/AIDS .. they may still be susceptible but less than before.

CRISPR has advanced a bit since then, so he should be better able to make the exactly needed edits today.

wouldn&#39;t getting rid of this debilitating affliction be a good thing?Not necessarily. Making genetic decisions on individual level is highly dangerous and could easily lead to extinction. For example, a genetic modification that would make one immune to most diseases or greatly prolong lifespan at the significant penalty to fertility would be a good choice individually but may lead to depopulation and extinction.

...and then laugh at both &#39;Murica and Jiiihna.

So to be clear, it&#39;s not good for Europe to depend on open source models they don&#39;t have to pay for where someone else is doing the work and spending the energy to create them? Sounds terrible all right.

Relying on a country you may be at war with before long... what could possibly go wrong?

Anyone who is making themselves reliant on general purpose LLM technology is fucking themselves over no matter who controls it.

How would using open source make one country reliant on another, much less one they &quot;may be at war with&quot;?  That&#39;s the thing with open source, once you have it you have it.

The Chinese &quot;open source&quot; LLM is a huge binary blob. Who knows what&#39;s really hidden inside it?

All of them really. What&#39;s typically open source is1) the code used for training, but never the dataset for initial LLM and never the RLHF (reinforcement learning with human feedback) data used to make a text vomiting LLM into a useful question answering maching.2) the resulting weights - these are totally uninterpretable.

So it&#39;s never fully replicable; even if you had the infra and were willing to burn electricity you don&#39;t have a way of going to 2) yourself.

AFAIK that&#39;s not just the Chinese but also open-

A war between Europe and China is geographically impractical.

Like, say, Ukraine.If the US were smart it would probably already be going on in Russia. But alas, we were stupid enough to put a Russian asset in the big chair.

If the US were smart it would probably already be going on in Russia. But alas, we were stupid enough to put a Russian asset in the big chair.

It&#39;s problematic for assurance because users cannot tell what undisclosed biases are baked into the weights -- and relying on someone else to do the bulk of the training means you cannot produce your own weights.

Even in classic open source, think of cases like an implementation of Dual_EC_DRBG, a malicious version of gotofail, or the xzutils backdoor.  Those are all cases where the source code was available.

So you mean you would need to test for accuracy like is already done with all models? Oh no! Anyway...

There is no reason to waste money on bullshit, and the world&#39;s biggest advertisement peddler is no visionary of any kind.

Since OpenAI has bought or pre-ordered all RAM and GPUs and CPUs that will be manufactured in the next 5 years, how can Europe do anything??!?

Perhaps it is best to see how China does and buy what&#39;s necessary on AliExpress, with free shipping.

&quot;Europe will end up using the Chinese models. It&#39;s probably not a good outcome for Europe.&quot;

This assumes that using these models is mandatory.  We don&#39;t know that, and it could very well be a &quot;good outcome&quot; for Europe.

Schmidt wants Europe to prepare space for Google since the US is becoming less and less stable.For European companies it makes much more sense to wait, or at least wait until models become better, and then steal whatever is available and start from there. I think it will be a hilarious trial if some European company will defend itself against Google, where Google has to assert that a A) it&#39;s Google&#39;s copyrighted property and B) Google has not used any copyrighted material from anyone else (which presumably would invalidate the copyright).

Open source business model fails when you give stuff away for free to people who want to bury you.

Gabfest Reads is a monthly series from the hosts of Slate’s Political Gabfest podcast. Recently, Emily Bazelon spoke with Curtis Sittenfeld about her short story collection, “Show Don’t Tell.” During their discussion, they explored recurring themes of the stories—from troubled marriages and middle age, to the passage of time and how our perception of people and events changes over the years.This partial transcript has been edited and condensed for clarity.

Emily Bazelon: A theme in this book that’s very present is marriage. And actually most of the marriages seemed bad to me as I was reading through this. I was feeling kind of sorry for a lot of people in their partnerships. And there actually is a story called “The Marriage Clock” in which you present explicit advice about how to improve your marriage. And the kind of joke of the story is that the advice comes from a kind of Christian influencer who wrote a really—an accidental—huge bestseller based on this idea of a marriage clock and these various tenets of a good marriage. So how did you come up with this list and what do you actually stand by on this list?

Curtis Sittenfeld: Oh, that’s a good question. Well, let’s see. I’m trying to think how to answer this. I mean, I can’t remember now, it’s like 10 or 12 recommendations and I think they’re a little bit sexist and heteronormative in some cases, but I think probably most of them are good ideas. It’s like, don’t call each other mommy and daddy or like don’t let your children sleep … I mean, I think there are probably good recommendations for the health of a marriage that for many people are probably may be too challenging to adhere to. Or like, I think there can be this tension where what’s good for the family is not good for the marriage. But I mean, I certainly have read marriage self-help books … I think that the two most prominent things that it seems like have permeated the culture are the love languages book and then sort of … I have not actually read the book on attachment theory, but I’m very conversant in attachment theory.

Curtis Sittenfeld: I know— like many people in 2026.

Emily Bazelon: My favorite item on this list, “do not engage in any form of self-grooming in front of your spouse that you wouldn’t perform in the boarding gate area of an airport.”

Curtis Sittenfeld: I’m very interested in the discrepancy between who we aspire to be and who we are on a daily basis. And like so many of us know what we should do to have strong relationships or to have good physical health, but it’s so hard. It’s just so hard. Knowing what the right choices are is different from feeling equipped to make them. And even the person you are at like 3:00 PM or 8:00 PM is maybe less equipped to make good choices than the person you were at like 8:15 AM.

Welcome to this week’s edition of the Surge, which is so grateful to have you as adoring readers but will sue you in North Carolina if you alienate your affection for us.

We’ve got a lot of foreign policy this week, a telltale sign that the foreign policy ain’t going great. Domestically, control of the Senate could come down to Alaska, or at least that’s what reporters are telling their editors as they try to secure summer trips. And a Ford factory worker became the new face of the resistance.

First, we begin with the slew of scandals and drama at the Justice Department this week and attempt to discern the root of it all.

Even by the Trump Justice Department’s standards over the last year, this was an eyebrow-raising week. We learned Sunday night, from the dawg Jay Powell himself, that the Federal Reserve chair was under DOJ investigation, ostensibly for his testimony related to Fed renovation costs, but really because he wasn’t lowering interest rates fast enough for Trump. The White House has tried to distance itself from the investigation—to portray it as D.C.’s U.S. attorney Jeanine Pirro freelancing—but Trump has been pressuring Powell for a long, long time. We also learned this week that federal prosecutors are investigating five additional Democratic lawmakers who posted a video last year urging troops to ignore illegal orders. (The Pentagon has been harassing another Democrat, Sen. Mark Kelly, for months.) Trump had called their video “seditious.” Meanwhile, a wave of DOJ prosecutors resigned under pressure to investigate not the ICE killing of Renee Good in Minneapolis, but Good’s widow instead.

Amid the backdrop of a lousier-than-usual week at the DOJ, the most revealing story of the week may have been one in the Wall Street Journal about Trump’s increasing frustration with Attorney General Pam Bondi. “The criticisms,” the Journal wrote, “appear to be part of an intense campaign by Trump to pressure the Justice Department to more aggressively pursue his priorities”—specifically, pursuing his enemies. Consider, too, a separate Journal story about a White House photo op with U.S. attorneys last week during which Trump berated them for being “weak” and complained that they weren’t “moving fast enough to prosecute his favored targets.” Trump has a poor history with attorneys general who, at one point or another, can’t find within the law the answers to his questions. So long as Bondi wants to keep her job, there are many more bad weeks ahead.

The retiring North Carolina Republican senator deserves credit this week for offering meaningful pushback to the administration’s threats against Powell. Shortly after Powell’s SOS message went up Sunday night, Tillis announced that he would oppose any of the president’s Fed nominees until the Powell matter was resolved. Given Tillis’ seat on the Banking Committee, that pledge would prevent any Fed nominee—including Powell’s upcoming replacement as chair—from getting voted out of committee. The pushback from Tillis, and a fair number of other Republican senators, was enough to calm markets and put the White House on its back foot.

Tillis, liberated from electoral concerns, has been speaking up against the administration’s errors more openly in the last couple of weeks. We could leave it at that. But the Surge’s bylaws are clear that no nit be left unpicked, and so we have to quibble with his framing. Tillis’ argument is that the administration is making some dumb decisions because Trump is receiving bad advice. Whichever adviser pursued the “vindictive prosecution” against Powell, he said, needs to “grow up and give the president better advice.” And in terms of seizing Greenland, he said separately that he blamed “whoever told the president that this was a viable path. It doesn’t make sense.” We understand that calling the principal himself an idiot wouldn’t be the most effective means of dissuading him from destructive ideas. But it is the principal, not the advisers, who are the problem. Trump wants to annex Greenland because it looks big on a map, and so the advisers are competing with each other to achieve that for him. He insists the Fed lower interest rates faster, so there’s a Cabinet-wide contest to do what it takes. The bad ideas are coming from the man himself, and he won’t take no for an answer.

The president reiterated on Wednesday that the United States “needs” Greenland, and that anything less than Greenland being “in the hands of the UNITED STATES” is “unacceptable.” And on Friday, while a bipartisan congressional delegation visited Copenhagen to reassure Danish leaders that Congress stood in the way of Trump’s Greenland plans (sure you are, guys), Trump was threatening tariffs against countries if they “don’t go along with Greenland.” You can actually hear his dopamine rush when he says this.

On that note, let’s look at a couple of consequences of Trump’s yearlong effort to antagonize the United States’ closest friends and allies in the free world. In a sentence we never quite thought we’d have to write, numerous European Union countries are deploying troops and military personnel to Greenland in a show of support to Denmark against American aggression towards its allies. Repeat: Europe is sending troops to Greenland while America threatens to seize it. And on Friday during a visit to Beijing, Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney agreed to slash its 100 percent tariff on Chinese electric cars in exchange for China importing more Canadian agricultural products, and said China had become a more “predictable” trading partner than the U.S. Can the Supreme Court go ahead and release that opinion nuking Trump’s tariffs powers soon, please?

The major recruitment news of the week was that former Democratic Alaska Rep. Mary Peltola launched a bid for Senate against incumbent Republican Dan Sullivan. Peltola, who’s reusing the “Fish, family, and freedom” slogan that carried her to House victory in 2022 before a narrow reelection loss in 2024, gives Democrats a fighting chance in a red state where Peltola has won statewide, given that there’s only one congressional district in Alaska, in very recent memory.

Her recruitment is also a critical piece of a much larger puzzle: Giving Democrats a chance—we’re saying there’s a chance!—to pick up the net four seats they would need to retake control of the Senate in the midterms. If Democrats can retain all of the seats they control (including tough races in Michigan and Georgia), the path to Senate control runs through winning the open seat in North Carolina, finally replacing Susan Collins in Maine, hoping ex-Sen. Sherrod Brown can oust Sen. John Husted in Ohio, and then Peltola in Alaska. This is the way, and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer gave 18 billion interviews this week describing it as such. It’s important to observe that each step along this path is quite difficult, and completing it would require a midterm wave in Democrats’ favor. Stranger things have happened.

Even a handful of days ago, a U.S. intervention against the Iranian regime, as the country was swarmed with protests that were being brutally put down, seemed like it was imminent. Military options had been prepared and presented for the president; U.S. personnel were being advised to leave the U.S. military base in Qatar. By Wednesday night, though, Trump said that “we’ve been told that the killing in Iran is stopping—it’s stopped—it’s stopping. And there’s no plan for executions, or an execution.” Iran had signaled as much on Thursday. What Iran has or has not stopped, we don’t know. But this came as the administration received advice from allies in the region—including Saudi Arabia and Israel—not to intervene, arguing that the protests weren’t strong enough to topple the regime and U.S. intervention would cause regional chaos.

Now, Trump could very well surprise-bomb Iran overnight if someone cracks a little too much fresh-ground pepper on his steak. But with the apparent deescalation, the Surge wants to send its thoughts and prayers to South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham. As we wrote last week, he was riding high on the Venezuela intervention and hoped that Trump might fulfill Graham’s top bucket-list item—regime change in Iran—next. Graham was all over TV and social media this week egging on his audience of one. He described Trump as “Reagan Plus” and openly urged him to kill Ayatollah Khamenei. He met with the Shah of Iran’s son, who’s eager to take control of the country. When Trump’s tone shift came later in the week, Graham scrambled to deny that Trump had swung against action or that the protests had ebbed in Iran, and said that he no longer wanted to be allies with allies that told Trump not to get involved. It’s always hard for Graham when a country goes un-bombed, and this is the big one. Let’s give him a little space.

Last week in the Senate, five Republicans joined all Democrats to advance a war powers resolution barring the president from using military force in Venezuela without congressional sign-off. Despite his administration’s firm promise that they have no additional military plans in Venezuela, Trump was furious, saying those five Republicans “should never be elected to office again.” Republican leaders and administration officials set off a fierce pressure campaign to kill the resolution.

The pressure campaign was successful. On Wednesday, Senate Republicans killed the resolution with another procedural vote, having convinced two of the five Republicans—Sens. Josh Hawley and Todd Young—to back off. What were their excuses? Both said that they received a variety of “assurances” from the administration that there were no troops in Venezuela at the moment, and that if the administration does want to send troops in the future, it will totally ask Congress first. Now, the Surge doesn’t think it would be that much effort to encode those promises into law, to be extra careful. You just go to the Senate floor, stick your thumb up, and you’ve voted for it. But what do we know?

Trump’s team organized a nice little afternoon for him on Tuesday: a visit to Michigan to visit Ford’s F-150 factory, where the big trucks get made. Neat! As he was walking through the plant with Ford’s CEO, a 40-year-old line worker later identifying himself as TJ Sabula shouted “Pedophile protector!” at Trump. The president pointed back at him, said “Fuck you,” and then gave him the middle finger. Sabula was suspended.

Sabula, in an interview with the Washington Post, said that he had “no regrets whatsoever” about what he did. “I don’t feel as though fate looks upon you often, and when it does, you better be ready to seize the opportunity,” he said. “And today I think I did that.” While Sabula is concerned about losing his job—and maybe should be a little worried about, like, ICE showing up to his door, pretending that he tried to run over the president with one of the trucks he was assembling—his act of heckling is being well remunerated. A couple of GoFundMe pages in his name have raised over $800,000.

President Trump REALLY wants to invoke the Insurrection Act. He’s fallen hard for this 200-year-old law that would allow him to deploy active duty military to enforce civilian law on American streets. On this week’s Amicus podcast, co-host Mark Joseph Stern is joined by Professor Steve Vladeck, a nationally recognized expert on the Supreme Court, federal courts, national security law, and military justice. They discuss what’s been stopping Trump from invoking the act so far, why he has no legal authority to do so right now, and what happens if he does it anyway.

Next, Mark talks to Julia Gegenheimer, former special litigation counsel in the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division’s Criminal Section, and now a special litigation counsel at Georgetown Law’s Institute for Constitutional Advocacy and Protection. Julia and Mark discuss the remaining paths to justice after the killing of Renee Good and examine what happens when the DOJ abandons its duty to seek accountability and vindicate civil rights.

            <p><strong>The Register | 2026-01-20</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2026/01/20/mozilla_offers_firefox_rpm/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">If you can&#39;t wait to get the bleeding-edge version of Firefox, we have good news. Mozilla is offering native RPM packages of Firefox Nightly for Linux distros in the greater Red Hat and SUSE families.

Mozilla&#39;s Firefox remains the dominant browser in the worlds of Linux and the BSDs – and now the company has started offering native RPM packages of the development version, known as Firefox Nightly. This makes it easy to install Firefox directly from Mozilla onto distros that use RPM packages, including the Red Hat, SUSE, and Mandriva families.

While Mozilla has traditionally offered native Linux binaries for Firefox, until recently, it delivered them in the form of a tarball. In other words, this is the Unix equivalent of a Zip file, which you must manually uncompress somewhere and run, as opposed to packaged software that can be installed or removed with any particular distro&#39;s packaging tools. Tarballs have a number of drawbacks compared to native packages, not least that their use requires more Linux competence than many a container-slinging Kubernetes contraption-captain can muster.

Tarballs work, but because they are not managed by the OS&#39;s package manager, they won&#39;t get automatically updated along with the rest of the OS – although in our testing, Firefox and its many offshoots are adept at automatically upgrading themselves when installed this way, as is normal for macOS applications.

Conversely, native RPM packages have several advantages. They integrate with the OS, so apps appear in app launchers, with the proper icons. It&#39;s easier to set them as the default too (we reported on a related issue in Debian way back in 2021.)

This will be welcome in some quarters. The big enterprise vendors seem to be pulling away from the desktop and workstation Linux market slightly. One sign of this was when Red Hat stopped packaging LibreOffice for RHEL 10. It&#39;s not alone: SUSE announced SUSE Linux Enterprise 16 last October, but neglected to mention that this doesn&#39;t include a corresponding version of SUSE Linux Enterprise Desktop. SUSE&#39;s evaluation downloads page maxes out at SLED 15 SP7.

Mozilla&#39;s packages will make life a little easier if you&#39;re running one of the free RHELatives, and other less-related distros too. When the CentOS team announced the inclusion of Firefox ESR packages at CentOS Connect last year, it was met with applause. Now, something newer than the Extended Support Release will be easier. The same packages should also work on Alma Linux and Rocky Linux.

There are other RPM-based distro families out there other than Red Hat and CentOS. This vulture ran openSUSE as his daily driver for four years, and, in our experience then, if there was no native openSUSE RPM package of something, the chances of a Fedora package working fine were quite high.

This is not an unexpected move: Mozilla started offering Debian packages of Firefox Nightly in October 2023, launching an online APT package repository, ahead of Firefox 122&#39;s release almost two years ago. This time, Mozilla launched the binary and the repo at the same time. We will not be surprised if RPM packages of official releases follow not far behind the developer-focused Nightly builds – and probably of subsidiary MZLA&#39;s Thunderbird messaging client, as well.

This could reduce the maintenance burden for the maintainers of Fedora and CentOS, plus those of openSUSE, and also the greater Mandriva and Mageia family. ®

            <h2>Remember VoidLink, the cloud-targeting Linux malware? An AI agent wrote it</h2>
            <p><strong>The Register | 2026-01-20</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2026/01/20/voidlink_ai_developed/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">VoidLink, the newly spotted Linux malware that targets victims&#39; clouds with 37 evil plugins, was generated &quot;almost entirely by artificial intelligence&quot; and likely developed by just one person, according to the research team that discovered the do-it-all implant.

Last week, Check Point Research published a report on the never-before-seen malware samples, originally discovered in December, and said it seemed to be an in-progress framework - not a fully production-ready tool - that originated from a Chinese-affiliated development environment.

It&#39;s designed to run in Linux-based cloud environments, and automatically scans for and detects AWS, Google Cloud Platform, Microsoft Azure, Alibaba, and Tencent.

Plus, it&#39;s packed with custom loaders, implants, rootkits, and numerous modules that provide attackers with a whole range of stealthy, operational-security capabilities, making it &quot;far more advanced than typical Linux malware,&quot; Check Point said.

In a new analysis published Tuesday, the security shop said the malware was likely not the product of a large, well-resourced development team, despite initially appearing that way. Instead, Check Point Research believes VoidLink was authored almost entirely by AI, likely under the direction of a single individual, with development artifacts showing it reached a first functional implant in under a week.

&quot;VoidLink demonstrates that the long-awaited era of sophisticated AI-generated malware has likely begun,&quot; the threat hunters wrote.

The team came to this conclusion after noting that the 30-week planned development timeline, leaked in VoidLink internal documents, didn&#39;t match up with the observed timeline, which indicated a much faster process.

&quot;Deeper investigation revealed clear artifacts indicating that the development plan itself was generated and orchestrated by an AI model and that it was likely used as the blueprint to build, execute, and test the framework,&quot; the report said, noting that the timestamped artifacts showed VoidLink evolving from a concept to a functional piece of malware in less than a week.

The developer began working on VoidLink in late November, and used Trae Solo - an AI assistant embedded in the integrated development environment Trae - to generate a Chinese-language instruction document. The individual didn&#39;t directly ask the AI agent to build the malware. In fact, they instructed the model not to implement code or provide technical details about malware building techniques, which could be an attempt to manipulate the AI into bypassing its safety guardrails.

Additionally, the code repository mapping documentation suggests that the model was fed a minimal codebase as the starting point for the malware, and that starting point was completely rewritten, end to end.

Check Point&#39;s researchers also found a work plan written in Chinese for three development teams: a core team (using Zig programming language), an arsenal team (C), and a backend team (Go).

The documentation, which the security sleuths say &quot;bears all the hallmarks of a large language model,&quot; includes sprint schedules, feature breakdowns, and coding guidelines.

While the exercise was presented to the model as a 30-week engineering effort, the timestamped documents indicate it only took six days to develop 88,000 lines of code, at which point it was uploaded to VirusTotal on December 4, and that&#39;s when Check Point&#39;s research began.

According to the malware hunting team, this indicates that AI - when used by a capable developer - can produce sophisticated offensive security tools faster, and at scale, without the funding and other resources typically only seen in experienced threat groups.

It&#39;s not a fully autonomous AI-driven attack. But it does show that AI agents can help humans produce very capable, sneaky tools for nefarious purposes. ®

            <h2>Dead batteries cough up lithium after a bath in CO₂ and water, boffins say</h2>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Lithium-ion batteries are everywhere, and recycling them cleanly and safely at scale is still hard. Now, a Chinese research team claims to have discovered a way to recycle Li-ion batteries using carbon dioxide and water. Just don&#39;t expect it to revolutionize the market overnight.

The team, from the Chinese Academy of Sciences and Beijing Institute of Technology, recently published their findings in Nature Communications. According to their research, the process not only avoids conventional leaching chemicals and extreme heat to extract lithium from old batteries, but it also uses carbon dioxide in what the authors call a sequestration step, and turns other battery transition metals into new catalysts - with CO₂-rich water doing most of the chemical work.

According to the researchers, more than 95 percent of the lithium in spent batteries can be recovered after mechanochemically treating the cathodes and then leaching them with CO₂-rich water, where carbonic acid formation enables selective separation of lithium as water-soluble lithium bicarbonate.

&quot;Conducted under ambient conditions without additional grinding aids or leaching agents, this method minimizes environmental impact,&quot; the boffins explained. Other &quot;methods often require substantial reagent inputs, produce hazardous emissions and secondary pollution, and generate leaching residues.&quot;

Those residues, the team explained, then typically have to be processed using acid leaching to be converted into salt solutions before reuse, which further reduces their value.

The &quot;three-in-one&quot; strategy developed by the team also eliminates those additional processing needs, with transition metals in the cathode, like cobalt, nickel, and the like, &quot;simultaneously transformed into high-performance oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts,&quot; the researchers explained. OER catalysts are a key component in converting electrical energy into stored chemical energy in water-splitting systems, and are used in electrolyzers and related energy-conversion technologies, giving the non-lithium components of lithium-ion batteries a continued role in the energy supply chain.

Finally, the team claims that their method incorporates some of the carbon dioxide used in the process into bicarbonate and carbonate intermediates, which they describe as a form of CO₂ sequestration.

Lithium batteries take many forms and can be found in everything from disposable single-use electronics to electric vehicles. As the default form of energy storage used in most electronics, lithium and its rechargeable variant lithium-ion, is being produced in greater quantities each year, with no signs of the battery market slowing down.

It&#39;s debatable how many lithium batteries are actually recycled, with an often-cited but contested figure suggesting the number could be as low as just five percent. Regardless of the actual figure, a cleaner and more sustainable method of recycling lithium batteries is necessary and it&#39;s not clear whether the Chinese CO2 method will scale or be commercially viable any time soon.

Case in point, the Chinese team isn&#39;t even the first to have figured this particular method out.

Ames National Laboratory in Iowa, USA, published its own findings in 2024 on an ambient-temperature method for recycling lithium-ion batteries that relies on water and carbon dioxide rather than harsh chemicals or high heat. Dubbed the Battery Recycling and Water Splitting (BRAWS) method, the approach shares the use of CO₂ and water with the Chinese team&#39;s work, but focuses on a different part of the battery and emphasizes different outputs.

One key difference we noted is that BRAWS concentrates on extracting lithium from the anode rather than the cathode, recovers lithium in the form of lithium carbonate rather than lithium bicarbonate, and is explicitly designed to produce green hydrogen as a byproduct through water splitting, alongside lithium recovery.

Needless to say, it&#39;s 2026 and BRAWS is nowhere in sight as a commercial alternative to more hazardous methods of lithium extraction despite the immediate need for widespread use of such a technology. In other words, don&#39;t expect the Chinese method to immediately change the lithium-ion recycling game either.

We contacted both Ames and the Chinese research team to learn more about how their methods differ and whether we could expect either to scale in the near future, but didn&#39;t hear back. ®

            <h2>Power scarcity drives datacenters to Texas, where the juice is</h2>
            <p><strong>The Register | 2026-01-20</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2026/01/20/texas_datacenter_hotspot/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Everything&#39;s bigger in Texas, including the amount of available power. That&#39;s why the Lone Star State is set to become the leading bit barn market within a few years, and why hyperscalers and colocation providers now expect roughly a third of datacenter campuses to rely entirely on onsite power by 2030.

These findings come from the 2026 Datacenter Power Report [PDF] by Bloom Energy, a firm whose business is manufacturing solid oxide fuel cells, so it has more than a passing interest in onsite power generation.

It says that, in just over a year, power availability has moved from being one of many planning considerations to one of the major constraints on datacenter growth, and this factor is reshaping the industry, at least in the US.

The demand for energy from these massive server farms is growing rapidly, with the report claiming that total IT infrastructure load could roughly double over the next few years, from about 80 GW in 2025 to 150 GW or more by 2028.

But as The Register has covered before, it often isn&#39;t possible to add extra grid and generating capacity at the same rate as new server farms are popping up, because of issues such as planning restrictions and funding.

Perhaps not helping is that datacenter firms consistently expect power to be available up to two years earlier than the utilities and power generating companies say it can be delivered, according to the report.

This is forcing operators to go where the power is, and Texas is expected to be a big winner here, thanks to its ample energy resources. Bloom Energy forecasts that, by 2028, the state could exceed 40 GW of IT capacity, nearly 30 percent of the anticipated US total, and more than double its current share.

Currently, Virginia is the datacenter capital, with Northern Virginia alone accounting for nearly 15 percent of global hyperscale capacity, according to figures from Synergy Research Group.

Regions such as California, Iowa, Oregon, and Nebraska are likely to see declines of more than 50 percent in relative market share, due to their restrictions on power availability, permitting complexity, and longer connection timelines that limit their attraction for datacenter expansion, the report says.

Meanwhile, hyperscalers and colocation providers are increasingly looking to onsite power generation rather than relying on the grid for some sites. The report claims that the share of those expecting to operate campuses fully powered this way by 2030 has increased by 22 percent and will make up roughly one-third of all datacenters.

Deploying onsite generation as a temporary bridge to grid power remains the most common deployment model, but the report authors forecast that permanent onsite power will become the go-to solution for minimizing development timelines and costs.

Bloom Energy naturally notes that fuel cells are a leading candidate for onsite power. But the preferred choice of datacenter operators is likely to be gas turbine generation, as this is a technology that is well established.

However, there is such high demand for this equipment that there is now a shortage, with customers facing long lead times to receive them. Gas turbines also have the disadvantage of greenhouse gas emissions and noise, which could cause planning problems and impact net-zero plans by operators.

Fuel cells avoid combustion noise and many emissions, but they can be expensive to deploy - partly because some types use costly catalyst materials - and using hydrogen as a fuel introduces storage, infrastructure and safety challenges.

The report also forecasts an increase in scale for new-build datacenters, with one in five campuses expected to exceed 1 GW by 2030, rising to nearly one in three by 2035.

Operators are advised that they need to act earlier and plan more aggressively to secure power and align their electrical strategy with the scale of their AI requirements, as well as expand where and how they site campuses. ®

            <h2>Rackspace tests customer loyalty with brutal email price hike</h2>
            <p><strong>The Register | 2026-01-20</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2026/01/20/rackspace_price_changes/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Rackspace is giving a masterclass in how to annoy customers after an eye-watering price hike for email hosting.

Complaints were loud and clear following the increases. The company&#39;s retail pricing for email, for example, went from $2.99 per mailbox per month in November 2025 to $10 per mailbox per month in January 2026.

In both instances, the company cheerfully said: &quot;Get world-class business email at a fraction of the cost of other platforms.&quot;

The Register asked Rackspace to justify the increase, particularly since the product appears unchanged: 25 GB mailboxes, 30 GB file storage, and a 100 percent uptime guarantee. Unless, of course, the company is hit by a &quot;security incident&quot; like the one that downed its hosted Exchange environment.

Rackspace has yet to respond, but its customers are less than impressed with the increase and the abrupt manner in which arrived. One volume reseller said: &quot;My monthly bill just went from $2,400 a month to $5,100 a month. A $2,700 a month increase.&quot;

Another, who claimed to have been a customer for more than 13 years, was also angered, saying: &quot;Really? This is how they treat long-term clients? I guess I now need to dick around finding a new provider.&quot;

Rackspace took to X (formerly Twitter) to explain itself, posting: &quot;We know price changes can be frustrating. This decision wasn&#39;t made lightly and reflects the ongoing costs of operating and maintaining the service.&quot;

The company suggested that disgruntled customers chat with a support specialist after submitting a ticket through its Control Panel.

The response was about as measured as you would expect, particularly after such a big jump: &quot;&#39;Frustrating&#39; doesn&#39;t cover it. A 400 percent price increase with little over a month&#39;s notice would be bad enough for B2C. But for resellers who you KNOW will be burdened with massive cost and/or admin to off-board, you&#39;ve basically said a giant &#39;fuck you, we don&#39;t care&#39;.&quot;

Independent hosting service Laughing Squid Hosting responded by separating email hosting from its pricing and suggested customers consider an alternative email provider to save costs. It said: &quot;After almost 27 years using Rackspace as our email provider, they have suddenly announced that they are increasing our email pricing by an astronomical 706 percent, with only a month and a half&#39;s notice.

&quot;There have been reasonable price increases over the years as expected, but nothing like this.&quot;

Rackspace told El Reg that it had to increase prices, but that customers who are unhappy should call its support line to check their options.

&quot;Our mission is to deliver a quality, trusted and reliable hosted email solution for businesses,&quot; the company said. &quot;We are committed to delivering top-tier email services backed by our award-winning Fanatical Support.&quot; ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">This week, OpenAI CFO Sarah Friar took to the internet to make a bold pitch for the company&#39;s future, which she claims is bright, despite what the current numbers say.

If you buy her logic, you must believe some things to be true, regardless of the poorly connected thread of logic that appears to hold them together. In what we can only assume is a pitch to soften up the market for more investment and possibly an IPO, Friar argues that one of the things people should believe about OpenAI is that the more money it spends, the more money it makes.

Running through the AI poster child&#39;s achievements over the last couple of years, Friar said that the business&#39;s compute grew 9.5x from 2023 to 2025 from 0.2 GW to around 1.9 GW. Meanwhile, &quot;revenue followed the same curve&quot; by growing 10x in the same period from $2 billion to more than $20 billion in 2025.

&quot;We firmly believe that more compute in these periods would have led to faster customer adoption and monetization,&quot; she said.

The more you spend, the more you make. It can be true, of course, but it doesn&#39;t always follow.

What OpenAI needs is for people to go from using its AI tools the way they use them now to using them more in the future.

Rest assured that is on the to-do list for 2026. &quot;The priority is closing the gap between what AI now makes possible and how people, companies, and countries are using it day to day. The opportunity is large and immediate, especially in health, science, and enterprise, where better intelligence translates directly into better outcomes,&quot; she said.

The American aphorism &quot;if you&#39;re so smart, why ain&#39;t you rich?&quot; springs to mind.

Nonetheless, Friar sees monetization naturally following the kind of investment in computing power necessary to stress the electricity resources of the world&#39;s largest economy.

&quot;As intelligence moves into scientific research, drug discovery, energy systems, and financial modeling, new economic models will emerge. Licensing, IP-based agreements, and outcome-based pricing will share in the value created. That is how the internet evolved. Intelligence will follow the same path,&quot; she asserts.

So, we have the old &quot;something will emerge&quot; argument, which is guaranteed to win over any bank manager who is asked for an unsecured loan for magic beans.

Speaking of banks, HSBC last year glanced at OpenAI&#39;s plans to balance the books and was not entirely convinced that everything added up. It predicted OpenAI&#39;s ChatGPT consumer products would attract 3 billion regular users by 2030, up from 800 million last year, increase subscription rates (10 percent versus 8 percent), and increase corporate demand for APIs and licensing, plus a larger share of digital advertising revenue for AI companies.

Nonetheless, OpenAI &quot;would need $207 billion of new financing by 2030,&quot; the bank said.

Separate analysis underscores how much would need to change to make the LLM builder viable: right now, 95 percent of the 800 million people using ChatGPT, which generates roughly 70 percent of the company&#39;s recurring revenue, aren&#39;t paying.

Out of the mix of paying customers and potential business models, OpenAI is clearly hoping something will emerge.

So do we, and that is not just El Reg&#39;s famous sense of goodwill and generosity toward the tech industry talking.

Nvidia, OpenAI, Microsoft, Oracle, AMD, CoreWeave, xAI, and a few others are all signed up to mutually dependent deals, some of which involve exchanges of stock.

Some commentators have noted the importance to the world as a whole. Financial Times contributing editor Ruchir Sharma pointed out last year that AI accounted for 40 percent of US GDP growth and 80 percent of the gains in US stocks in 2025.

More recently, the IMF predicted US growth would strongly outpace the rest of the G7 this year, forecasting an expansion of 2.4 percent in 2026 and 2 percent in 2027. Tech investment had surged to its highest share of US economic output since 2001, helping drive growth, the IMF found.

However, Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas, IMF chief economist, said there were &quot;reasons to be somewhat concerned&quot; about the &quot;risk of a market correction, if expectations about AI gains in productivity and profitability are not realized.&quot;

Tiptoeing the fine line between wishful thinking and begging, Friar&#39;s missive reminds us how important OpenAI&#39;s plans might be to us all.

Six years ago, Sundar Pichai, CEO of Google&#39;s parent company, Alphabet, told the world that AI would be as profound, in terms of human evolution, as the harnessing of fire. One thing is for sure – the industry certainly has a big enough flame to make sure the world&#39;s economy burns down. ®

Christopher Klay, who previously developed the Stadia Enhanced browser extension, is one of many who saved a copy of the tool to a personal GitHub page. What’s more, they’re hosting a working copy of that Google website right here to make it even easier.

I haven’t tried Klay’s mirror, as both of my gamepads are already converted, but here’s my video on how easy the process is. It’s worth doing now that the pads work relatively well with Steam! I maintain that while Google made a lot of mistakes, it’s an amazing example of shutting down a service the right way.

If you buy digital games for the Nintendo Switch 2, Samsung’s P9 microSD Express card offers an easier way to expand your storage without constantly deleting games to make room. It’s cheaper than other microSD cards, and it’s an even better value right now, with the 512GB version priced at $79.99 ($40 off) — just $5 shy of its best price to date. You can alternatively buy the 256GB model for $39.99 ($15 off) at Amazon.

While the Switch 2’s 256GB internal storage is enough for most first-party Nintendo games, just one or two large downloads can quickly eat up space. Cyberpunk 2077, for example, takes up 59GB, while Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade on Switch 2 is a 93GB download — meaning that buying both would use up over half of the console’s internal storage. Many third-party games eat up dozens of gigabytes each as well, which means it’s only a matter of time before that 256GB fills up.

That’s what makes Samsung’s P9 a smart investment. It gives you the flexibility to grow your digital library, and it’s built to handle the Switch 2’s faster storage speeds — so you can add games without noticeably affecting performance. All in all, it’s a great buy if you want to avoid running out of space as your Switch 2 library grows. And as a bonus, you can also use it with other compatible devices — including some cameras, tablets, and drones that support microSD cards.

Life is Strange: Reunion launches in March.

A little over a decade ago, Life is Strange burst onto the scene with a unique blend of teen drama and interactive storytelling. That first game told the story of Max Caulfield, who had the supernatural ability to reverse time, and her best friend Chloe Price. Now developer Deck Nine Games is finally bringing their story to an end with a new game called Reunion.

The latest entry in the series follows 2024’s Double Exposure, which similarly continued Max’s story from the original game. The developer describes Reunion as the “emotional conclusion of the Max and Chloe saga.” Players will have three days to attempt to avoid a fire at their old college, where Max is now a teacher. Here’s the basic set-up:

Returning from a weekend away, Max finds her beloved Caledon ablaze, as a raging inferno destroys the hallowed grounds and ends the lives of Max’s friends, students, and faculty alike. Max only escapes the devastation due to her Rewind power — returning from the original Life is Strange — a supernatural ability that lets her reverse time. Jumping back in time through a selfie, Max now has just three days to work out how the fire began. Can she make the most of her second chance to prevent this fiery disaster?

The twist is that both characters will be playable for the first time. While Max retains her time travel power, Chloe’s skill is her back talk and attitude, which can apparently do a hella good job of dealing with suspects.

Of course, while Reunion marks the end of this particular storyline, that doesn’t necessarily mean Life is Strange won’t continue. The series has adopted something of an anthology format, with several games — Life is Strange 2 and Life is Strange: True Colors — telling all new stories within the same themes and gameplay structure.

It appears that Life is Strange: Reunion won’t be an episodic release — publisher Square Enix describes it as “a full-length adventure” — and it’s launching on March 26th on the PS5, Xbox, and PC.

The 11-inch iPad Pro is receiving the biggest discount, but you can still save on the base iPad, the iPad Mini, and the iPad Air.

While the best iPad deals usually land during major sale events like Black Friday, many great iPad deals are available outside of those times. The day-to-day discounts come and go like changing winds, so there’s often some amount to be saved, particularly on Apple’s most affordable iPad, the iPad Mini, and the latest iPad Air. Hell, you can even often find discounts on the latest M5 iPad Pro, which is already on sale at multiple retailers. If you don’t need the latest tech, though, now may be a good time to save on the M4 Pro as inventory dwindles.

All that being said, it’s difficult to know where exactly you can find the most notable iPad deals unless you’re scouring the major retailers on a daily basis. But that’s often what our deal hunters at The Verge are doing, so let us help you out. Below, we’ve listed the best deals you can get on each iPad model that is available, from the 11th-gen base iPad to the more powerful models with M3 and M4 chips.

Apple’s 11th-gen iPad landed on the scene in March. The newest base-model tablet is a fairly iterative update of the prior model, but with 128GB of base storage (as opposed to 64GB) and the A16 Bionic chip, which is nearly 30 percent faster than the A14 chip used in the 10th-gen iPad. However, the newer chip doesn’t support the various Apple Intelligence features introduced in iPadOS 18.1 and subsequent updates. For that, you’ll want to opt for a more recent iPad Air, iPad Mini, or iPad Pro model.

Pricing-wise, the latest iPad starts at $349 with Wi-Fi and 128GB of storage. You can also upgrade to 256GB or 512GB of storage for an additional $100 or $200, respectively, or purchase an LTE model starting at $499. We saw a pretty significant price drop to $279 during Black Friday; however, right now, it’s only available at Amazon and B&H Photo starting at $319, saving you $30. Alternatively, you can purchase the 256GB model at Amazon and B&H Photo starting at $429 ($20 off), or the 512GB variant at Amazon starting at $600 ($50 off).

The seventh-gen iPad Mini is similar in several ways to the previous model, but comes with some big internal upgrades. It includes faster Wi-Fi and USB-C speeds, support for the Apple Pencil Pro, and a newer A17 Pro processor with 8GB of RAM to support Apple Intelligence. Otherwise, it boasts nearly identical specs and features as the last-gen model, meaning it has an 8.3-inch Liquid Retina display and options for 5G. It may not be worth upgrading if you already own a sixth-gen Mini, but newcomers to the category will appreciate the upgrades.

The 2024 iPad Mini starts at $499 with 128GB of storage, which was the price for the previous generation’s 64GB model. Electing for 256GB of storage brings the price up to $599, and the cellular models start at $649. These are some big numbers for a small iPad, so the larger iPad Air might be worth considering if you prefer your dollar to go further with more screen real estate. But if you want an Apple tablet in the smallest possible form factor, this is where the action is.

Right now, the 128GB base model with Wi-Fi is on sale at Amazon and B&H Photo in select colors starting at $469, which is a mere $30 discount and a far cry from its all-time low of $349. If you need additional storage, you can pick up the 256GB variant at Amazon and B&H Photo for $549 ($50 off), which is about $100 shy of the lowest price we’ve seen on the step-up configuration.

The 2025 iPad Air is little more than a spec bump over the previous model, with a few technical upgrades that should allow it to last longer into the future than either the entry-level iPad or the last-gen Air. It features an M3 chip with support for Apple Intelligence, plus compatibility with Apple’s latest Magic Keyboard that has a larger trackpad and an extra row of function keys. In short, the Air is a credible laptop replacement.

The 11-inch model starts at $599 and the 13-inch variant $799 — the same price as prior models — but it’s common to see discounts from third-party retailers. Right now, for instance, the 11-inch Air is on sale at Amazon and B&H Photo in its base configuration with Wi-Fi and 128GB of storage starting at $559, which is $40 off but the highest sale price we’ve seen in months. You can also grab the 256GB model at Amazon starting at $643.93 (about $55 off), or the step-up 512GB model at Amazon for $824.99 (about $74 off).

The larger 13-inch model, meanwhile, is on sale at Amazon and B&H Photo with Wi-Fi and 128GB of storage starting at $729 ($70 off), which is almost $100 shy of its best price to date. You can also grab the 256GB model at Amazon starting at $824.99 (about $74 off), or the step-up 512GB model at Amazon for $1,012.17 (about $87 off), neither of which matches the lows we saw toward the end of last year.

While there are some deals floating around for the M4 iPad Pro, we’d argue none of them are particularly noteworthy given the current discounts on the 2025 iPad Pro. Apple’s latest high-end tablet offers a few upgrades over the last-gen model, including a faster M5 chip, a new C1X cellular modem (if you get the cellular version), and an N1 chip for Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and Thread. Apple also increased read and write speeds to memory, and the latest Pro supports fast charging, allowing you to charge it to 50 percent capacity in about 30 minutes.

Although the tablet launched in October, we’re already seeing the price drop at several retailers. The 11-inch base model with 256GB of storage is currently down to $899 ($100 off) at Amazon and B&H Photo, for instance, while the model with Wi-Fi and 512GB of storage is on sale at Amazon and B&H Photo for $1,099 ($100 off). You can also snag the configuration with Wi-Fi and 1TB of storage for $1,510 (about $89 off) at Amazon.

If you want a larger display, you can get the 13-inch iPad Pro in its 256GB base configuration for $1,199 ($100 off) at Amazon and B&H Photo, which is the second-best price we’ve seen on the premium 13-incher. The step-up model with Wi-Fi and 512GB of storage, meanwhile, is down to $1,399 (also $100 off) at B&H Photo, while the 1TB model can be had at Amazon for $1,759 (about $140 off), roughly $20 more than its lowest price to date.

Though Netflix’s upcoming Star Search reboot will feature a panel of celebrity judges, viewers are going to have a hand in choosing which contestants win the competition.

Ahead of Star Search’s premiere tonight, Netflix has announced that it is launching a new real-time voting functionality that will give you the ability to tell the streamer which performer you want to see succeed. Rather than having to send in a text message or visit a special website as was the case with American Idol, Star Search’s voting can be done within the Netflix app while the show is airing live on Tuesdays and Wednesdays at 9PM ET / 6PM PT.

In addition to the app, it will be possible to vote via smart TVs and streaming devices like Apple TV, Roku, and Fire TV. But in its post about the feature, Netflix stressed that voting will not be available if you’re watching via a browser, and voting will be limited to a specific time window while Star Search is streaming live.

While Star Search is airing, viewers will be prompted to give each performance a rating of 1–5 stars, with each episode’s results being tallied and shared by the end of the broadcast. Each Netflix profile will be limited to one vote per performance, and once a vote has been submitted, it can’t be changed.

Everything about the feature makes it sound like Netflix is angling for Star Search to be the kind of event that keeps the audience engaged enough to keep their eyes on the screen. That would be a welcome change of pace in this era of casual viewing, but Star Search’s success is going to hinge on how good the show’s performances are.

            <div id="article-text">Bowser retired from Nintendo at the end of 2025.

Bowser retired from Nintendo at the end of 2025.

Doug Bowser is joining Hasbro’s board of directors just weeks after retiring as Nintendo of America’s president, according to an announcement on Tuesday.

Though Hasbro’s press release doesn’t provide any specifics about Bowser’s role on the board of directors, the company has big plans for its future in video games. Hasbro already licenses its intellectual property, including Magic: The Gathering and Dungeons & Dragons, for video game titles, but the company’s chief marketing officer, Jason Bunge, said the company aims to develop its first video game this year as part of a broader foray into the gaming industry.

Bowser became the head of NoA in 2019, following the departure of Reggie Fils-Aimé. During his tenure, he oversaw several major changes at Nintendo, including the expansion into film that brought in more than $1 billion with the release of The Super Mario Bros. Movie, the launch of the Switch 2, and the opening of Super Nintendo World in California and Florida.

Nintendo announced Bowser’s retirement in September 2025, but he officially left the company at the end of last year. Devon Pritchard, NoA’s former executive vice president, has taken over his role.

            <h2>Reimagining ERP for the agentic AI era</h2>
            <p><strong>MIT Technology Review | 2026-01-20</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2026/01/20/1129965/reimagining-erp-for-the-agentic-ai-era/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The story of enterprise resource planning (ERP) is really a story of businesses learning to organize themselves around the latest, greatest technology of the times. In the 1960s through the ’80s, mainframes, material requirements planning (MRP), and manufacturing resource planning (MRP II) brought core business data from file cabinets to centralized systems. Client-server architectures defined the ’80s and ’90s, taking digitization mainstream during the internet’s infancy. And in the 21st century, as work moved beyond the desktop, SaaS and cloud ushered in flexible access and elastic infrastructure.

The rise of composability and agentic AI marks yet another dawn—and an apt one for the nascent intelligence age. Composable architectures let organizations assemble capabilities from multiple systems in a mix-and-match fashion, so they can swap vendor gridlock for an à la carte portfolio of fit-for-purpose modules. On top of that architectural shift, agentic AI enables coordination across systems that weren’t originally designed to talk to one another.

Early indicators suggest that AI-enabled ERP will yield meaningful performance gains: One 2024 study found that organizations implementing AI-driven ERP solutions stand to gain around a 30% boost in user satisfaction and a 25% lift in productivity; another suggested that AI-driven ERP can lead to processing time savings of up to 45%, as well as improvements in decision accuracy to the tune of 60%.

These dual advancements address long-standing gaps that previous ERP eras fell short of delivering: freedom to innovate outside of vendor roadmaps, capacity for rapid iteration, and true interoperability across all critical functions. This shift signals the end of monolithic dependency as well as a once-in-a-generation opportunity for early movers to gain a competitive edge.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">AI agents are moving beyond coding assistants and customer service chatbots into the operational core of the enterprise. The ROI is promising, but autonomy without alignment is a recipe for chaos. Business leaders need to lay the essential foundations now.

Agents are independently handling end-to-end processes across lead generation, supply chain optimization, customer support, and financial reconciliation. A mid-sized organization could easily run 4,000 agents, each making decisions that affect revenue, compliance, and customer experience.

The transformation toward an agent-driven enterprise is inevitable. The economic benefits are too significant to ignore, and the potential is becoming a reality faster than most predicted. The problem? Most businesses and their underlying infrastructure are not prepared for this shift. Early adopters have found unlocking AI initiatives at scale to be extremely challenging.

Companies are investing heavily in AI, but the returns aren&#39;t materializing. According to recent research from Boston Consulting Group, 60% of companies report minimal revenue and cost gains despite substantial investment. However, the leaders reported they achieved five times the revenue increases and three times the cost reductions. Clearly, there is a massive premium for being a leader.

What separates the leaders from the pack isn&#39;t how much they&#39;re spending or which models they&#39;re using. Before scaling AI deployment, these “future-built” companies put critical data infrastructure capabilities in place. They invested in the foundational work that enables AI to function reliably.

To understand how and where enterprise AI can fail, consider four critical quadrants: models, tools, context, and governance.

Take a simple example: an agent that orders you pizza. The model interprets your request (&quot;get me a pizza&quot;). The tool executes the action (calling the Domino&#39;s or Pizza Hut API). Context provides personalization (you tend to order pepperoni on Friday nights at 7pm). Governance validates the outcome (did the pizza actually arrive?).

Each dimension represents a potential failure point:

This framework helps diagnose where reliability gaps emerge. When an enterprise agent fails, which quadrant is the problem? Is the model misunderstanding intent? Are the tools unavailable or broken? Is the context incomplete or contradictory? Or is there no mechanism to verify that the agent did what it was supposed to do?

The temptation is to think that reliability will simply improve as models improve. Yet, model capability is advancing exponentially. The cost of inference has dropped nearly 900 times in three years, hallucination rates are on the decline, and AI’s capacity to perform long tasks doubles every six months.

Tooling is also accelerating. Integration frameworks like the Model Context Protocol (MCP) make it dramatically easier to connect agents with enterprise systems and APIs.

If models are powerful and tools are maturing, then what is holding back adoption?

To borrow from James Carville, “It is the data, stupid.” The root cause of most misbehaving agents is misaligned, inconsistent, or incomplete data.

Enterprises have accumulated data debt over decades. Acquisitions, custom systems, departmental tools, and shadow IT have left data scattered across silos that rarely agree. Support systems do not match what is in marketing systems. Supplier data is duplicated across finance, procurement, and logistics. Locations have multiple representations depending on the source.

Drop a few agents into this environment, and they will perform wonderfully at first, because each one is given a curated set of systems to call. Add more agents and the cracks grow, as each one builds its own fragment of truth.

This dynamic has played out before. When business intelligence became self-serve, everyone started creating dashboards. Productivity soared, reports failed to match. Now imagine that phenomenon not in static dashboards, but in AI agents that can take action. With agents, data inconsistency produces real business consequences, not just debates among departments.

Companies that build unified context and robust governance can deploy thousands of agents with confidence, knowing they&#39;ll work together coherently and comply with business rules. Companies that skip this foundational work will watch their agents produce contradictory results, violate policies, and ultimately erode trust faster than they create value.

The question for enterprises centers on organizational readiness. Will your company prepare the data foundation needed to make agent transformation work? Or will you spend years debugging agents, one issue at a time, forever chasing problems that originate in infrastructure you never built?

Autonomous agents are already transforming how work gets done. But the enterprise will only experience the upside if those systems operate from the same truth. This ensures that when agents reason, plan, and act, they do so based on accurate, consistent, and up-to-date information.

The companies generating value from AI today have built on fit-for-purpose data foundations. They recognized early that in an agentic world, data functions as essential infrastructure. A solid data foundation is what turns experimentation into dependable operations.

At Reltio, the focus is on building that foundation. The Reltio data management platform unifies core data from across the enterprise, giving every agent immediate access to the same business context. This unified approach enables enterprises to move faster, act smarter, and unlock the full value of AI.

Agents will define the future of the enterprise. Context intelligence will determine who leads it.

            <p><strong>MIT Technology Review | 2026-01-20</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2026/01/20/1131462/the-uk-government-is-backing-ai-scientists-that-can-run-their-own-experiments/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">A number of startups and universities that are building “AI scientists” to design and run experiments in the lab, including robot biologists and chemists, have just won extra funding from the UK government agency that funds moonshot R&D. The competition, set up by ARIA (the Advanced Research and Invention Agency), gives a clear sense of how fast this technology is moving: The agency received 245 proposals from research teams that are already building tools capable of automating increasing amounts of lab work.

ARIA defines an AI scientist as a system that can run an entire scientific workflow, coming up with hypotheses, designing and running experiments to test those hypotheses, and then analyzing the results. In many cases, the system may then feed those results back into itself and run the loop again and again. Human scientists become overseers, coming up with the initial research questions and then letting the AI scientist get on with the grunt work.

“There are better uses for a PhD student than waiting around in a lab until 3 a.m. to make sure an experiment is run to the end,” says Ant Rowstron, ARIA’s chief technology officer.

ARIA picked 12 projects to fund from the 245 proposals, doubling the amount of funding it had intended to allocate because of the large number and high quality of submissions. Half the teams are from the UK; the rest are from the US and Europe. Some of the teams are from universities, some from industry. Each will get around £500,000 (around $675,000) to cover nine months’ work. At the end of that time, they should be able to demonstrate that their AI scientist was able to come up with novel findings.

Winning teams include Lila Sciences, a US company that is building what it calls an AI nano-scientist—a system that will design and run experiments to discover the best ways to compose and process quantum dots, which are nanometer-scale semiconductor particles used in medical imaging, solar panels, and QLED TVs.

“We are using the funds and time to prove a point,” says Rafa Gómez-Bombarelli, chief science officer for physical sciences at Lila: “The grant lets us design a real AI robotics loop around a focused scientific problem, generate evidence that it works, and document the playbook so others can reproduce and extend it.”

Another team, from the University of Liverpool, UK, is building a robot chemist, which runs multiple experiments at once and uses a vision language model to help troubleshoot when the robot makes an error.

And a startup based in London, still in stealth mode, is developing an AI scientist called ThetaWorld, which is using LLMs to design experiments on the physical and chemical interactions that are important for the performance of batteries. The experiments will then be run in an automated lab by Sandia National Laboratories in the US.

Compared with the £5 million projects spanning two or three years that ARIA usually funds, £500,000 is small change. But that was the idea, says Rowstron: It’s an experiment on ARIA’s part too. By funding a range of projects for a short amount of time, the agency is taking the temperature at the cutting edge to determine how the way science is done is changing, and how fast. What it learns will become the baseline for funding future large-scale projects.

Rowstron acknowledges there’s a lot of hype, especially now that most of the top AI companies have teams focused on science. When results are shared by press release and not peer review, it can be hard to know what the technology can and can’t do. “That’s always a challenge for a research agency trying to fund the frontier,” he says. “To do things at the frontier, we&#39;ve got to know what the frontier is.”

For now, the cutting edge involves agentic systems calling up other existing tools on the fly. “They’re running things like large language models to do the ideation, and then they use other models to do optimization and run experiments,” says Rowstron. “And then they feed the results back round.”

Rowstron sees the technology stacked in tiers. At the bottom are AI tools designed by humans for humans, such as AlphaFold. These tools let scientists leapfrog slow and painstaking parts of the scientific pipeline but can still require many months of lab work to verify results. The idea of an AI scientist is to automate that work too.

AI scientists sit in a layer above those human-made tools and call ton hose tools as needed, says Rowstron. “But there’s a point in time—and I don’t think it’s a decade away—where that AI scientist layer says, ‘I need a tool and it doesn’t exist,’ and it will actually create an AlphaFold kind of tool just on the way to figuring out how to solve another problem. That whole bottom zone will just be automated.”

That’s still some way off, he says. All the projects ARIA is now funding involve systems that call on existing tools rather than spin up new ones.

There are also unsolved problems with agentic systems in general, which limits how long they can run by themselves without going off track or making errors. For example, a study, titled “Why LLMs aren’t scientists yet,” posted online last week by researchers at Lossfunk, an AI lab based in India, reports that in an experiment to get LLM agents to run a scientific workflow to completion, the system failed three out of four times. According to the researchers, the reasons the LLMs broke down included changes in the initial specifications and “overexcitement that declares success despite obvious failures.”

“Obviously, at the moment these tools are still fairly early in their cycle and these things might plateau,” says Rowstron. “I’m not expecting them to win a Nobel Prize.”

“But there is a world where some of these tools will force us to operate so much quicker,” he continues. “And if we end up in that world, it’s super important for us to be ready.”

Nandan Nilekani can’t stop trying to push India into the future. He started nearly 30 years ago, masterminding an ongoing experiment in technological state capacity that started with Aadhaar—the world’s largest digital identity system.

Using Aadhaar as the bedrock, Nilekani and people working with him went on to build a sprawling collection of free, interoperating online tools that add up to nothing less than a digital infrastructure for society, covering government services, banking, and health care. They offer convenience and access that would be eye-popping in wealthy countries a tenth of India’s size.

At 70 years old, Nilekani should be retired. But he has a few more ideas. Read our profile to learn about what he’s set his sights on next.

Many Americans agree that it’s acceptable to screen embryos for severe genetic diseases. Far fewer say it’s okay to test for characteristics related to a future child’s appearance, behavior, or intelligence. But a few startups are now advertising what they claim is a way to do just that.

This new kind of testing—which can cost up to $50,000—is incredibly controversial. Nevertheless, the practice has grown popular in Silicon Valley, and it’s becoming more widely available to everyone. Read the full story.

On the outskirts of Charlottesville, Virginia, a new kind of sugar factory is taking shape. The facility is being developed by a startup called Bonumose. It uses a processed corn product called maltodextrin that is found in many junk foods and is calorically similar to table sugar (sucrose).

But for Bonumose, maltodextrin isn’t an ingredient—it’s a raw material. When it’s poured into the company’s bioreactors, what emerges is tagatose. Found naturally in small concentrations in fruit, some grains, and milk, it is nearly as sweet as sucrose but apparently with only around half the calories, and wider health benefits.

Bonumose’s process originated in a company spun out of the Virginia Tech lab of Yi-Heng “Percival” Zhang. When MIT Technology Review spoke to Zhang, he was sitting alone in an empty lab in Tianjin, China, after serving a two-year sentence of supervised release in Virginia for conspiracy to defraud the US government, making false statements, and obstruction of justice. If sugar is the new oil, the global battle to control it has already begun. Read the full story.

Just before Christmas the Trump administration dramatically escalated its war on digital rights by banning five people from entering the US. One of them, Josephine Ballon, is a director of HateAid, a small German nonprofit founded to support the victims of online harassment and violence. The organization is a strong advocate of EU tech regulations, and so finds itself attacked in campaigns from right-wing politicians and provocateurs who claim that it engages in censorship.

EU officials, freedom of speech experts, and the five people targeted all flatly reject these accusations. Ballon told us that their work is fundamentally about making people feel safer online. But their experiences over the past few weeks show just how politicized and besieged their work in online safety has become. Read the full story.

Chatbots are skilled at crafting sophisticated dialogue and mimicking empathetic behavior. They never get tired of chatting. It’s no wonder, then, that so many people now use them for companionship—forging friendships or even romantic relationships. 72% of US teenagers have used AI for companionship, according to a study from the nonprofit Common Sense Media. But while chatbots can provide much-needed emotional support and guidance for some people, they can exacerbate underlying problems in others—especially vulnerable people or those with mental health issues.

Although some early attempts to regulate this space are underway, AI companionship is going nowhere.

It’s a “complex and subtle emotion that elicits feelings of comfort, serenity, and a gentle sense of floating.” It’s peaceful, but more ephemeral and intangible than contentment. It might be evoked by the sight of a sunset or a moody, low-key album.

If you haven’t ever felt this sensation—or even heard of it—that’s not surprising. A Reddit user generated it with ChatGPT, along with advice on how to evoke the feeling. Don’t scoff: Researchers say more and more terms for these “neo-­emotions” are showing up online, describing new dimensions and aspects of feeling. Read our story to learn more about why.

Gavesh’s journey started, seemingly innocently, with a job ad on Facebook promising work he desperately needed.

Instead, he found himself trafficked into a business commonly known as “pig butchering”—a form of fraud in which scammers form close relationships with targets online and extract money from them. The Chinese crime syndicates behind the scams have netted billions of dollars, and they have used violence and coercion to force their workers, many of them trafficked like Gavesh, to carry out the frauds from large compounds, several of which operate openly in the quasi-lawless borderlands of Myanmar.

Big Tech may hold the key to breaking up the scam syndicates—if these companies can be persuaded or compelled to act. Read the full story.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Today marks an inflection point for enterprise AI adoption. Despite billions invested in generative AI, only 5% of integrated pilots deliver measurable business value and nearly one in two companies abandons AI initiatives before reaching production.

The bottleneck is not the models themselves. What’s holding enterprises back is the surrounding infrastructure: Limited data accessibility, rigid integration, and fragile deployment pathways prevent AI initiatives from scaling beyond early LLM and RAG experiments. In response, enterprises are moving toward composable and sovereign AI architectures that lower costs, preserve data ownership, and adapt to the rapid, unpredictable evolution of AI—a shift IDC expects 75% of global businesses to make by 2027.

AI pilots almost always work, and that’s the problem. Proofs of concept (PoCs) are meant to validate feasibility, surface use cases, and build confidence for larger investments. But they thrive in conditions that rarely resemble the realities of production.

“PoCs live inside a safe bubble” observes Cristopher Kuehl, chief data officer at Continent 8 Technologies. Data is carefully curated, integrations are few, and the work is often handled by the most senior and motivated teams.

The result, according to Gerry Murray, research director at IDC, is not so much pilot failure as structural mis-design: Many AI initiatives are effectively “set up for failure from the start.”

            <div id="article-text">In a Davos dominated by talk of tariffs, subsidies, and geopolitical risk, Europe used the stage to question its own economic limits. At the World Economic Forum, Ursula von der Leyen put forward one of the clearest signals yet that the European Union is preparing a structural shift in how it treats business, competitiveness, and economic power.

The phrase that stuck, “Europe Inc”, is not the name of a regulation, nor a new Brussels invention ready to roll out. It is a political framing for a shift that the European Commission wants to accelerate.

What Europe Inc actually refers to is an idea long discussed in EU policy circles and now pushed into the spotlight: the so-called 28th regime. An optional, EU-wide corporate framework that would sit alongside national systems and allow companies to operate across the bloc under a single legal structure.

The problem it is meant to solve is real and well-documented. Europe has a single market in theory, but in practice, companies still face 27 different company laws, registration processes, capital requirements, and administrative timelines. Startups incorporate in one country, then struggle to expand. Scaleups hit legal friction. Many leave.

The latest rumblings from the EU tech scene, a story from our wise ol&#39; founder Boris, and some questionable AI art. It&#39;s free, every week, in your inbox. Sign up now!

The Commission’s answer is simplification through centralisation. Under the proposed 28th regime, entrepreneurs would be able to set up a company digitally, once and use that structure across the EU. One registration, one legal form, one set of rules. The ambition presented at Davos goes further: company creation within 48 hours, fully online.

That figure matters. It is also where political ambition risks being read as immediate reality.

The 48-hour setup is not in force. It is a target attached to a proposal that still needs to be formally drafted, negotiated, and approved by both the European Parliament and member states. Nothing in current EU law allows this yet. What exists is intent, not implementation.

Von der Leyen was explicit about why this push is happening now. Global conditions have hardened. Trade is increasingly weaponised. Industrial policy has returned, unapologetically, in the US and China.

Supply chain shocks and energy crises exposed Europe’s vulnerabilities. In that environment, regulatory fragmentation stops being a technical issue and becomes a strategic one.

Europe Inc is Brussels admitting that rules alone do not build power. Scale does. There is also a political recalibration underway. The EU has traditionally defined itself as a regulator first, a market shaper second.

The message from Davos suggests a change in emphasis: competitiveness, capital mobilisation, and strategic autonomy are moving closer to the centre of EU policymaking.

Still, limits remain. The 28th regime, as currently described, would be optional. It would not harmonise taxation overnight. Labour law, insolvency rules, and social policy remain largely national domains. Europe Inc would coexist with national systems, not replace them.

That coexistence is both its strength and its risk. Optional frameworks can attract fast-growing companies, but they can also deepen a two-speed Europe if not carefully designed. This tension is not resolved yet.

What Davos revealed is not a finished Europe Inc, but a Commission willing to say openly that Europe’s economic model, as it stands, is too slow for the world it operates in. Whether Europe Inc becomes a meaningful tool or another unrealised promise will depend less on slogans and more on legislation, compromise, and political courage across 27 capitals.

For now, Europe Inc is best understood as a warning shot. Europe intends to compete as a bloc, not as a collection of administrative borders. The clock, as von der Leyen implied, is already running.

            <a class="original-link" href="https://thenextweb.com/news/odoo-tops-7-billion-valuation">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Belgian business software company Odoo, also a unicorn, has reached a fresh milestone. Growth investor General Atlantic has increased its stake in the firm, buying additional shares from regional backer Wallonie Entreprendre and pushing Odoo’s valuation to roughly €7 billion.

This move isn’t a typical funding round where a company raises new capital. Instead, it’s a secondary transaction: General Atlantic bought existing shares that were previously held by Wallonie Entreprendre, the investment arm of Belgium’s Walloon region. After the deal, Wallonie Entreprendre still holds about 3 % of the company.

Odoo was founded in 2002 in Belgium and has grown steadily from a small project into a global software platform. It offers an integrated suite of business applications used by small and medium-sized enterprises for everything from finance and sales to HR and marketing.

The software is built on an open-core model that encourages developers around the world to build add-on apps, creating a vast ecosystem of nearly 40,000 extensions.

Today, Odoo counts more than 170,000 paying customers in around 180 countries. That global footprint and the steady revenue growth it has delivered helped convince General Atlantic to deepen its involvement.

A workspace designed for growth, collaboration, and endless networking opportunities in the heart of tech.

Since first investing in the company in 2023, the firm has supported Odoo’s expansion into new markets and helped refine its commercial strategy.

Part of what makes this update noteworthy is how Odoo has expanded its product offerings. Its newest versions include AI-infused features and automation tools that make the suite more attractive to businesses looking to replace outdated, fragmented systems with a single, unified digital platform.

For the European tech scene, this development highlights a shift in how successful software companies grow and attract capital. Rather than chasing quick exits or IPOs, some founders are choosing secondary share deals to let early investors realise gains while keeping strategic control.

That path can make it easier for companies to stay private longer and focus on building value over time.

I don’t know what is happening in Belgium or what they are having for breakfast, but the country itself has quietly become a place where software businesses can scale internationally.

Odoo is one of its standout success stories, showing that strong product focus, community-driven development, and global reach can win serious backing from major growth investors.

            <div id="article-text">For a long time, tech events were built around scale. The bigger the crowd, the stronger the perception of success. Attendance numbers became a proxy for impact, and festivals grew year after year because that was what the industry expected.

That model no longer fits how tech leaders work today.

Over the past years, I have spent time in conversations with founders, executives, and operators who carry real responsibility inside their organizations. As a community builder, I often speak with them before they commit to attending events. Their questions are direct. They want to know who will be in the room, how discussions are structured, and whether the environment allows honest exchange.

Almost none of them ask how many people will attend.

This is a meaningful signal. Leaders who run companies do not optimize for visibility. They already have it. They want rooms where time leads to insight, clarity, and decisions.

As CEO of Tekpon AI Summit, I have had a front row seat to how decision makers actually want to engage today. I have watched what happens on large stages. I have also watched what happens when ten relevant people sit around one table with no audience and no agenda beyond honest discussion.

The difference in outcome is hard to ignore. In small rooms, people speak openly. They share challenges they would never publish. They explore partnerships without formalities. They make decisions faster because trust forms naturally when everyone present has earned their place in the conversation.

In larger settings, the dynamic changes. Conversations stay cautious. Stories become polished. The real questions are postponed, usually for later. Later often disappears into busy schedules.

Large conferences still play a role. They introduce new voices to the ecosystem. They create energy. They give exposure to early-stage founders. That contribution remains valuable.

But they are no longer where serious business gets done.

The work that shapes companies happens in environments where attention is protected and trust forms quickly. Where people can speak without performing. Where context is shared. Where participants know that what is said in the room stays in the room. These conditions are difficult to build at a mass scale and natural in small, curated settings.

This has already changed how senior decision makers allocate their time. Many are reducing their presence at large events. They are choosing closed discussions, private dinners, and carefully selected gatherings where every participant has a reason to be there. They are not rejecting conferences. They are rejecting formats that do not respect their attention.

The industry is slow to react to this shift. Event strategies still chase attendance growth, sponsorship volume, and social media reach. Meanwhile, the people shaping companies are quietly changing their behavior. They are voting with their calendars.

This gap will continue to widen. Events that optimize for volume will struggle to attract senior leaders. Once you see this up close, it becomes hard to unsee. The criteria for choosing where to meet have changed. Not loudly, not publicly, but consistently.

Some will still chase scale. Others will keep building large festivals and broad platforms. There is nothing wrong with that. But the people shaping companies are already making different choices. They are selecting rooms where conversations move faster, trust forms naturally, and time feels respected.

That is where tech leaders now choose to meet.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Venture capital powerhouse Sequoia Capital is preparing to invest in Anthropic, the AI startup best known for its Claude family of large language models, in one of the largest private funding rounds in tech this year. The deal is being led by Singapore’s GIC and U.S. investor Coatue, each contributing roughly $1.5 billion, as part of a planned raise of $25 billion or more at a staggering $350 billion valuation.

This move stands out for two reasons: the size and speed of the valuation surge and the fact that Sequoia, already an investor in rival AI builders such as OpenAI and Elon Musk’s xAI, is broadening its exposure across competing AI platforms.

Traditionally, top-tier VC firms have avoided backing direct competitors simultaneously. The logic was simple: protect information flows and avoid internal conflicts of interest. Sequoia’s willingness to back Anthropic despite existing stakes in other AI outfits signals a shift in how investors view the AI market. It reflects a belief that the sector is large enough to support multiple winners rather than requiring firms to choose a single champion.

Anthropic itself has grown quickly since its founding by former OpenAI researchers. Industry reporting shows the company has attracted significant talent from established AI labs and introduced advanced models and enterprise features, contributing to its rapid valuation climb over the past year.

A $350 billion valuation, even before a public listing, is eye-watering. It resets expectations for what private AI companies can command and puts pressure on competitors to secure equally large capital backing or risk falling behind. Analysts suggest that few AI firms may go public at these valuations, pointing instead to continued private rounds or alternative exit strategies if market sentiment shifts.

That dynamic is a symptom of a broader trend: a global AI capital rush that has persisted even amid concerns about a bust cycle or a funding slowdown in other tech segments. Investors remain convinced that AI will reshape industries from software to logistics, health care, and beyond, and are willing to deploy extraordinary sums to secure influence in that future.

For European markets and founders, the Sequoia-Anthropic deal carries both opportunities and warnings. Europe has strong academic AI talent, an active startup ecosystem, and deep expertise in areas like robotics, industrial automation, and data privacy.

Yet venture capital density still trails the U.S., and marquee AI funding rounds of this scale are rare on the continent.
This investment could accelerate European interest in AI startups, drawing more attention and potentially more capital into the region.

It reinforces the idea that global capital flows are not limited by geography and that talent mobility, not territory, increasingly defines the AI race. European AI talent has been moving among global hubs, and deals like this underline how strongly competitive pressures are shaping that movement.

At the same time, the concentration of huge capital in a few dominant players raises strategic questions for European policymakers and investors. If global valuations continue to centralise power and resources in U.S. and Asia-based AI giants, Europe’s AI initiatives may struggle to build regional champions with equivalent scale.

Efforts to foster AI ecosystems, from regulatory clarity to public funding mechanisms, will be tested in the face of such capital dynamics.

Sequoia’s bet on Anthropic, despite its exposure to rivals, underscores a fundamental truth about where the AI race is headed: talent and execution matter more than regional advantage.

For European startups, this means honing in on distinctive technical niches, enterprise traction, and real-world impact rather than simply following headline valuations.

The Anthropic round may be a moment of spectacle, but its lasting impact will be measured in how ecosystems evolve, how talent flows, and how global competition shapes opportunities for innovation across borders. European players can benefit from these trends, but only if they leverage their own strengths in research, ethics-led deployment, and deep industry partnerships.

In the end, this deal isn’t just about money; it’s a signal of where confidence lies in the next chapter of AI, and who stands to gain as a result.

            <h2>Europe’s €307 million AI funding call</h2>
            <p><strong>The Next Web | 2026-01-19</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://thenextweb.com/news/europes-e307-million-ai-funding-call">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">When the European Commission announced on 15th of January a €307.3 million funding call for AI and related tech under Horizon Europe earlier this year, the press materials presented it as a strategic push toward trustworthy AI and European digital autonomy. The funding targets trustworthy AI, data services, robotics, quantum, photonics, and what Brussels calls “open strategic autonomy.”

Viewed in isolation, the number itself isn’t eye-popping. By global standards, where the private sector alone pours hundreds of billions into AI, €307 million is barely a rounding error. Yet this sum matters less for its scale and more for what it reveals about Europe’s longstanding dilemma: how to balance ambitious tech leadership with a cautious, value-driven regulatory culture.

What the EU has done here is consistent with a long-running pattern. Brussels has been building an AI ecosystem that explicitly prioritises ethics, safety , and strategic autonomy over raw capability. The “Apply AI Strategy,” which this funding supports, is designed to ensure AI systems are trustworthy and aligned with European values.

This contrasts sharply with the Silicon Valley model, where scale, speed , and commercial dominance often trump wider social aims.
There’s value in that distinction. Too much focus on growth alone can produce outcomes that benefit a few platforms while leaving society to manage the fallout from algorithmic bias , misinformation , and opaque decision-making systems.

Europe’s regulatory framework, including the Artificial Intelligence Act, embeds risk-based guardrails that aim to prevent harm without halting innovation entirely.

But here’s the rub: principle without productivity can feel like good intentions in a vacuum.

Three years into the AI revolution, the EU’s cumulative investments from this €307 million pool to broader programs under Horizon Europe reflect ambition on paper. But across hard metrics like proprietary model development, commercial AI exports, and infrastructure scale, Europe still lags the US and China. In 2025, reports noted Europe produced far fewer notable AI models than its global competitors, a symptom of a deeper ecosystem gap.

Investing in trustworthy AI is laudable; it’s also inherently longer-term, often without the immediate returns that lure commercial capital. By contrast, the US innovation model embraces iterative risk and market experimentation, which helps explain its dominance in foundational model research and deployment.

Here, Europe’s regulatory heft of the AI Act and related oversight mechanisms both help and hinder. Responsible frameworks can build trust and alignment with public values, but if they become too cumbersome, they risk slowing the very innovation they are meant to guide. Bosch’s leadership in Europe has cautioned against “regulating itself to death,” arguing that excessive bureaucracy deters research and deployment.

The €307 million funding explicitly aims to strengthen strategic autonomy and the ability of European innovators to develop AI technologies without dependency on external tech giants.

That’s a worthy goal. Yet autonomy is easier to declare than to realise. Achieving it requires not just funding research but building scale, infrastructure, talent, and market pull simultaneously. Europe’s efforts on AI gigafactories and high-performance computing centres signal long-term intent, but critics still see fragmentation in infrastructure and business support.
In other words, strategic autonomy without substantial ecosystem maturity can feel like sovereignty in theory, not practice.

The question isn’t whether Europe should fund AI research. The question is whether Europe can translate normative leadership into technological leadership.

If the goal is to lead in ethical, human-centric AI that serves public interest first, then this funding fits a broader philosophy. If the goal is to rival the scale and velocity of global tech powers, then incremental investments like this, however well-intentioned, are positions in a longer, incomplete race.

The EU’s approach to AI will succeed only if it pairs principled regulation with bold bets on infrastructure, startups and commercial pathways that scale quickly. That won’t happen through selective research grants alone.

Europe can still carve a distinctive niche in global AI. Its regulatory clarity, public-interest focus and collaborative innovation structures give it moral authority and, over time, competitive strength if it can channel them into meaningful technological outcomes.

For now, the €307 million is a marker on a long road, not a finish line. It signals where Brussels stands: committed to values, cautious by design, and eager to shape the trajectory of AI, even if it’s not yet setting the pace.

            <div id="article-text">European Commission opens call for evidence on Open Digital Ecosystems
Signal: The EU is preparing a structural shift toward open, interoperable digital infrastructure. This marks a move from regulating dominant platforms to actively shaping alternatives and reducing strategic dependency.

DMA and DSA enter an enforcement-heavy phase in 2026
Signal: Europe’s digital laws have moved from principle to execution. Compliance, fines, litigation, and operational constraints are now the central risk factors for large technology companies in the EU.

EUIPO reports record trademark and design filings in 2025
Signal: European technology and business are entering a consolidation phase. Brand protection and defensibility are becoming core competitive assets, not legal afterthoughts.

Nice Classification v13 confirmed for 2026
Signal: Trademark strategy in Europe is becoming more technical and granular. Weak or generic IP structuring will increasingly translate into long-term competitive disadvantage.

EU institutional funding continues to prioritize digital autonomy
Signal: Through Horizon Europe and related instruments, capital allocation is increasingly aligned with infrastructure, security, and sovereignty rather than consumer-driven technology cycles.

ECB commentary reinforces long-term focus on euro stability and autonomy
Signal: The macroeconomic backdrop continues to support policies around financial and digital autonomy, shaping the environment for payments, fintech, and infrastructure investments.

Rising transatlantic tension around EU tech regulation
Signal: Enforcement of DMA and DSA is now a geopolitical issue. Regulatory decisions in Europe are increasingly influencing how global technology firms design products and operations worldwide.

Europe is no longer focused on optimizing digital markets.
It is focused on shaping digital architecture and control points.

For founders, investors, and executives, the implication is clear: resilience, compliance, and strategic positioning in Europe will matter more than speed or scale alone.
