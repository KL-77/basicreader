            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-02-10</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2026/02/spacexs-starbase-is-coming-alive-again-after-a-lull-in-starship-testing/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The upgraded Super Heavy booster slated to launch SpaceX’s next Starship flight has completed cryogenic proof testing, clearing a hurdle that resulted in the destruction of the company’s previous booster.

SpaceX announced the milestone in a social media post Tuesday: “Cryoproof operations complete for the first time with a Super Heavy V3 booster. This multi-day campaign tested the booster’s redesigned propellant systems and its structural strength.”

Ground teams at Starbase, Texas, rolled the 237-foot-tall (72.3-meter) stainless-steel booster out of its factory and transported it a few miles away to Massey’s Test Site last week. The test crew first performed a pressure test on the rocket at ambient temperatures, then loaded super-cold liquid nitrogen into the rocket four times over six days, putting the booster through repeated thermal and pressurization cycles. The nitrogen is a stand-in for the cryogenic methane and liquid oxygen that will fill the booster’s propellant tanks on launch day.

The proof test is notable because it moves engineers closer to launching the first test flight of an upgraded version of SpaceX’s mega-rocket named Starship V3 or Block 3. SpaceX launched the previous version, Starship V2, five times last year, but the first three test flights failed. The last two flights achieved SpaceX’s goals, and the company moved on to V3.

The Super Heavy booster originally assigned to the first Starship V3 test flight failed during a pressure test in November. The rocket’s liquid oxygen tank ruptured under pressure, and SpaceX scrapped the booster and moved on to the next in line—Booster 19. This Super Heavy vehicle appears have sailed through stress testing, and SpaceX returned the booster to the factory early Monday. There, technicians will mount 33 Raptor engines to the bottom of the rocket and install the booster’s grid fins.

These components are changed from Starship V2. The Raptor engines set to debut on Starship V3 produce more thrust and include changes to improve reliability, according to SpaceX. The Raptor 3s are lighter with plumbing and sensors integrated into the engine’s main structure, eliminating the requirement for self-contained heat shields between the engines at the base of the rocket.

The new booster design only uses three grid fins, not four, to provide controllability during descent. The aerosurfaces help stabilize the rocket as it returns to Earth for recovery. The hot-staging ring at the top of the new version of the Super Heavy booster is integrated with the rocket to enable its return to Earth for reuse. The ring was jettisoned and expended on previous Starship flights.

After receiving its engines and grid fins, the Super Heavy booster will roll out to the launch pad at Starbase. SpaceX’s launch team will fill it with methane and liquid oxygen for a test-firing of its 33 engines.

Meanwhile, the first of SpaceX’s upgraded Starship vehicles—essentially the upper stage that flies on top of the Super Heavy booster—will travel to the Massey’s Test Site for its own cryogenic proof test campaign. It is also expected to undergo a static fire test of its six Raptor engines.

Assuming that all goes according to plan, SpaceX could be in position to launch the first Starship V3 test flight before the end of March. This will be the 12th full-scale Starship/Super Heavy test flight overall, and the mission will likely follow the same trajectory as previous flights, with Starship arcing halfway around the world from South Texas to a controlled reentry and splashdown in the Indian Ocean.

With the upcoming launch, SpaceX is eager to prove Starship V3’s readiness for more ambitious test flights, including an important orbital refueling experiment considered a stepping stone toward sending future Starships to the Moon, Mars, and other distant destinations.

NASA officials are closely watching Starship V3’s development because the refueling demonstration is on the critical path for the agency’s Artemis lunar program. A human-rated version of Starship is NASA’s primary option for a Moon lander to ferry astronauts to and from the lunar surface on the Artemis III mission, the next Artemis flight after the Artemis II circumlunar mission that is awaiting liftoff in the coming weeks.</div>

            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2026/02/wikipedia-might-blacklist-archive-today-after-site-maintainer-ddosed-a-blog/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Wikipedia editors are discussing whether to blacklist Archive.today because the archive site was used to direct a distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack against a blogger who wrote a post in 2023 about the mysterious website’s anonymous maintainer.

In a request for comment page, Wikipedia’s volunteer editors were presented with three options. Option A is to remove or hide all Archive.today links and add the site to the spam blacklist. Option B is to deprecate Archive.today, discouraging future link additions while keeping the existing archived links. Option C is to do nothing and maintain the status quo.

Option A in particular would be a huge change, as more than 695,000 links to Archive.today are used across 400,000 or so Wikipedia pages. Archive.today, also known as Archive.is, is a website that saves snapshots of webpages and is commonly used to bypass news paywalls.

“Archive.today uses advanced scraping methods, and is generally considered more reliable than the Internet Archive,” the Wikipedia request for comment said. “Due to concerns about botnets, linkspamming, and how the site is run, the community decided to blacklist it in 2013. In 2016, the decision was overturned, and archive.today was removed from the spam blacklist.”

Discussion among editors has been ongoing since February 7. “Wikipedia’s need for verifiable citations is absolutely not more important than the security of users,” one editor in favor of blacklisting wrote. “We need verifiable citations so that we can maintain readers’ trust, however, in order to be trustworthy our references also have to be safe to access.”

On the other side, an editor who supported Option C wrote that “Archive.today contains a vast amount of archives available nowhere else. Not on Wayback Machine, nowhere. It is the second largest archive provider across all Wikimedia sites. Removal/blockage of this site will be disruptive daily for thousands of editors and readers. It will result in a huge proliferation of {{dead link}} tags that will never be resolved.”

Several posts mentioned an ongoing FBI case that could eventually make the Archive.today links useless anyway. Some said it would be better to act now than to have Option A forced on them later without a backup plan.

One editor supported starting with Option B and eventually shifting to Option A with “the proper end goal being the WMF [Wikimedia Foundation] supporting some sort of archive system, whether their own original or directly supporting the Internet Archive’s work so it can be done more systematically.”

Some discussion centered on copyright infringement, given that Archive.today publishes copies of many copyrighted articles. “On the general problem of linking to copyright infringement: perhaps the Wikimedia Foundation can work on ways to establish legally licensed archives of major paywalled sites, in partnership with archives such as the Internet Archive,” one editor wrote. “It would be challenging given the business model of those sites, but maybe a workable compromise can be established that manages how many Wikipedia editors [have] access at a given time.”

The DDoS attack being discussed by Wikipedia editors was targeted at the Gyrovague blog written by Jani Patokallio. Last month, “the maintainers of Archive.today injected malicious code in order to perform a distributed denial of service attack against a person they were in dispute with,” the Wikipedia request for comment says. “Every time a user encounters the CAPTCHA page, their Internet connection is used to attack a certain individual’s blog.”

The trustworthiness of Archive.today was discussed in light of evidence that the site’s founder threatened to create “a new category of AI porn” in retaliation against the blogger. The AI porn threat was mentioned by several editors.

“I echo others [that Option] A is looking like something we’ll have to do eventually, anyways, and at least this way we have a chance to do it on our terms,” one editor wrote. “I hate to break it to you, but even if the FBI thing goes nowhere, a website whose operator apparently threatens to create AI porn in retaliation against enemies, using their names, isn’t a trustworthy mirror, and isn’t going to remain one.”

One editor reported being “miserable” about supporting Option A, “but we cannot permit websites to rope our readers into being part of DDoS attacks.” Moreover, “The fact is that most of the archive.today links on Wikipedia are not an attempt to save URLs that have now gone dead that the Internet Archive cannot handle, but efforts to bypass paywalls, which is convenient, but illegal. It’s strange that we accept links to archive.today for this purpose but don’t accept the same for Anna’s Archive or Sci-Hub,” the editor wrote.

Patokallio told us in an email today, “it’s true that there simply are no alternatives to archive.today for many sources that archive.org does not/cannot cover,” and that he hopes the Wikipedia request for comment “leads to the Wikimedia Foundation creating one as suggested by multiple commenters in the thread.”

The Wikimedia Foundation, the nonprofit that hosts Wikipedia, chimed in on the discussion today. “Our view is that the value to verifiability that the site provides must be weighed against the security risks and violation of the trust of the people who click these links,” wrote Eric Mill, head of the foundation’s product safety and integrity group. “We (WMF) encourage the English Wikipedia community to carefully weigh the situation before making a decision on this unusual case.”

Noting that “Archive.today’s owner has not been deterred from continuing the ongoing DDoS,” Mill wrote that “the same actions that make archive.today unsafe may also reduce its usefulness for verifying content on Wikipedia. If the owners are willing to abuse their position to further their goals through malicious code, then it also raises questions about the integrity of the archive it hosts.”

It’s possible the Wikimedia Foundation will act even if the volunteer editors decide to maintain the status quo. “We know that WMF intervention is a big deal, but we also have not ruled it out, given the seriousness of the security concern for people who click the links that appear across many wikis,” Mill wrote.

The Wikipedia request for comments acknowledged that whether to blacklist would be a difficult decision. There are “significant concerns for readers’ safety, as well as the long-term stability and integrity of the service,” but “a significant amount of people also think that mass-removing links to Archive.today may harm verifiability, and that the service is harder to censor than certain other archiving sites,” it said.

An update to the request for comments yesterday indicated that the attack temporarily stopped, but the malicious code had been reactivated. “Please do not visit the archive without blocking network requests to gyrovague.com to avoid being part of the attack!” it said.

The code’s first public mention was apparently in a Hacker News thread on January 14, and Patokallio wrote about the DDoS in a February 1 blog post. “Every 300 milliseconds, as long as the CAPTCHA page is open, this makes a request to the search function of my blog using a random string, ensuring the response cannot be cached and thus consumes resources,” he wrote. The Javascript code in the Archive.today CAPTCHA page is as follows:

In August 2023, Patokallio wrote a post attempting to uncover the identity of Archive.today founder “Denis Petrov,” which seems to be an alias. Patokallio wasn’t able to figure out who the founder is but cobbled together various tidbits from Internet searches, including a Stack Exchange post that mentioned another potential alias, “Masha Rabinovich.”

Patokallio seemed to be driven by curiosity and was impressed by Archive.today’s work. “It’s a testament to their persistence that [they’ve] managed to keep this up for over 10 years, and I for one will be buying Denis/Masha/whoever a well deserved cup of coffee,” Patokallio’s 2023 post said. In his post this month, Patokallio said his 2023 blog “gathered some 10,000 views and a bit [of] discussion on Hacker News, but didn’t exactly set the blogosphere on fire. And indeed, absolutely nothing happened for the next two years and a bit.”

But in October 2025, the FBI sent a subpoena to domain registrar Tucows seeking “subscriber information on [the] customer behind archive.today” in connection with “a federal criminal investigation being conducted by the FBI.” We wrote about the subpoena, and our story included a link to Patokallio’s 2023 blog post in a sentence that said, “There are several indications that the [Archive.today] founder is from Russia.”

In an email to Ars, Patokallio told us that the DDoS attack “appears to be because you kindly mentioned my blog in your Nov 8, 2025 story.” Patokallio added that he is “as mystified by this as you probably are.” Articles about the subpoena by The Verge and Heise Online also linked to Patokallio’s 2023 blog post.

We emailed Archive.today’s webmaster address today to ask for comment on the Wikipedia discussion. We received an email reply that said, “Ok, but first remove the paragraph with gyrovague excerpt from your previous article.”

On January 8, 2026, Patokallio’s hosting company, Automattic, notified him that it received a GDPR [General Data Protection Regulation] complaint from a “Nora Puchreiner” alleging that the 2023 post “contains extensive personal data… presented in a narrative that is defamatory in tone and context.” Patokallio said that after he submitted a rebuttal, “Automattic sided with me and left the post up.”

Patokallio said he also “received a politely worded email from archive.today’s webmaster asking me to take down the post for a few months” on January 10. The email was classified as spam by Gmail, and he didn’t see it until five days later, he said. In the meantime, the DDoS started.

Patokallio said he replied to the webmaster’s email on January 15 and again on January 20 but didn’t hear back. He tried a third time on January 25, saying he would not take down the blog post but offered to “change some wording that you feel is being misrepresented.”

Patokallio posted what he called a lightly redacted copy of the resulting email thread. The first email from the Archive.today webmaster said, “I do not mind the post, but the issue is: journos from mainstream media (Heise, Verge, etc) cherry-pick just a couple of words from your blog, and then construct very different narratives having your post the only citable source; then they cite each other and produce a shitty result to present for a wide audience.”

In a later email, “Nora Puchreiner” wrote, “I do not care on your blog and its content. I just need the links from Heise and other media to be 404.” One message threatened to investigate “your Nazi grandfather” and “vibecode a gyrovague.gay dating app.” Another threatened to create a public association between Patokallio’s name and AI porn.

A Tumblr blog post apparently written by the Archive.today founder seems to generally confirm the emails’ veracity, but says the original version threatened to create “a patokallio.gay dating app,” not “a gyrovague.gay dating app.” The Tumblr blog has several other recent posts criticizing Patokallio and accusing him of hiding his real name. However, the Gyrovague blog shows Patokallio’s name in a sidebar and discloses that he works for Google in Sydney, Australia, while stating that the blog posts contain only his personal views.

In one email, Patokallio included a link to Wikipedia’s page on the Streisand effect, a name for situations in which people seeking to suppress access to information instead draw more public attention to the information they want hidden. The Archive.today site maintainer apparently viewed this as a threat.

“And threatening me with Streisand… having such a noble and rare name, which in retaliation could be used for the name of a scam project or become a byword for a new category of AI porn… are you serious?” the email said. Patokallio responded, “No, you’re Streisanding yourself: the DDOS has already drawn more attention to my blog post than it had gotten in the last two years, with zero action on my side.”

A subsequent reply in the email thread contained the “Nazi grandfather” and “gay dating app” threats. Patokallio wrote that after these emails, it didn’t seem worthwhile to continue the discussion. “At this point it was pretty clear the conversation had run its course, so here we are,” Patokallio wrote in his February 1 blog post. “And for the record, my long-dead grandfather served in an anti-aircraft unit of the Finnish Army during WW2, defending against the attacks of the Soviet Union. Perhaps this is enough to qualify as a ‘Nazi’ in Russia these days.”

While the outcome at Wikipedia is not yet settled, Patokallio wrote that the DDoS attack didn’t cause him any real harm. The Archive.today maintainer apparently intended to make Patokallio’s hosting costs more expensive, but “I have a flat fee plan, meaning this has cost me exactly zero dollars,” he wrote.

In a post on social media, Wu expressed warm feelings for his time at xAI, but said it was “time for my next chapter.” The current era is one where “a small team armed with AIs can move mountains and redefine what’s possible,” he wrote.

The mention of what “a small team” can do could hint at a potential reason for Wu’s departure. xAI reportedly had 1,200 employees as of March 2025, a number that included AI engineers and those focused more on the X social network. That number also included 900 employees that served solely as “AI tutors,” though roughly 500 of those were reportedly laid off in September.

Wu’s departure comes just months after fellow xAI co-founder Igor Babuschkin departed the company in August to start his own AI safety-focused venture capital firm. Co-founders Kyle Kosic and Christian Szegedy also departed the company since its 2023 founding, and co-founder Greg Yang stepped back from the company last month amid complications from chronic Lyme disease.

Other recent high-profile xAI departures include general counsel Robert Keele, communications executives Dave Heinzinger and John Stoll, head of product engineering Haofei Wang, and CFO Mike Liberatore, who left for a role at OpenAI after just 102 days of what he called “120+ hour weeks.”

Wu leaves a company that is in a very different place than it was when he helped create it in 2023. His departure comes just days after CEO Elon Musk merged xAI with SpaceX, a move Musk says will allow for orbiting data centers and, eventually, “scaling to make a sentient sun to understand the Universe and extend the light of consciousness to the stars!” But some see the move as more of a financial engineering play, combining xAI’s nearly $1 billion a year in losses and SpaceX’s roughly $8 billion in annual profits into a single, more IPO-ready entity.

Musk previously rolled social media network X (formerly Twitter) into a unified entity with xAI back in March. At the time of the deal, X was valued at $33 billion, 25 percent less than Musk paid for the social network in 2022.

xAI has faced a fresh wave of criticism in recent months over Grok’s willingness to generate sexualized images of minors. That has led to an investigation by California’s attorney general and a police raid of the company’s Paris offices.</div>

            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-02-10</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2026/02/dewormer-ivermectin-as-cancer-cure-rfk-jr-s-nih-funds-absurd-study/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The National Cancer Institute is using federal funds to study whether cancer can be cured by ivermectin, a cheap, off-patent anti-parasitic and deworming drug that fringe medical groups falsely claimed could treat COVID-19 during the pandemic and have since touted as a cure-all.

Large, high-quality clinical trials have resoundingly concluded that ivermectin is not effective against COVID-19. And there is no old or new scientific evidence to support a hypothesis that ivermectin can cure cancer—or justify any such federal expenditure. But, under anti-vaccine Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.—who is otherwise well-known for claiming to have a parasitic worm in his brain—numerous members of the medical fringe are now in powerful federal positions or otherwise hold sway with the administration.

During a January 30 event, Anthony Letai, a cancer researcher the Trump administration installed as the director of the NCI in September, said the NCI was pursuing ivermectin.

“There are enough reports of it, enough interest in it, that we actually did—ivermectin, in particular—did engage in sort of a better preclinical study of its properties and its ability to kill cancer cells and we’ll probably have those results in a few months. So we are taking it seriously.”

The comments were highlighted today in a report from KFF Health News. Ars Technica was also at the event, “Reclaiming Science: The People’s NIH,” which was hosted by the MAHA [Make America Healthy Again] Institute. In the rest of his comments, Letai seemed to make a noticeable effort to temper expectations while also trying to avoid offending any ivermectin believers. “It’s not going to be a cure-all for cancer,” he said. At another point, he said that even if there are signals of anti-cancer properties in the preclinical studies, “I can tell you again, it’s not a really strong signal.”

But, he quickly noted, “this doesn’t rule out… individual reports of people having taken it that had a response to their cancer. This doesn’t invalidate their personal experience.”

KFF noted that among those individual reports is one from Mel Gibson, who said in a January 2025 episode of Joe Rogan’s podcast that a regimen of drugs that includes ivermectin cured stage 4 cancers in three of his friends. The episode has been viewed more than 12 million times.

NCI scientists who spoke to KFF under the condition of anonymity for fear of retaliation blasted the funding. “I am shocked and appalled,” one said. “We are moving funds away from so much promising research in order to do a preclinical study based on nonscientific ideas. It’s absurd.”

Another called the suggestion that the NCI had previously overlooked ivermectin’s potential “ridiculous.”

“This is not a new idea they came up with,” the NCI scientist said.

While the revelation that the NCI is funding research based on fringe anecdotes rather than scientific evidence is spurring backlash, it also raises new questions about Letai, who was otherwise a respected cancer researcher prior to taking the role of NCI director.

In an interview with STAT News last month, Letai was asked if there were ethical lines he wouldn’t cross for the administration. He responded: “My job is to progress the mission of the National Cancer Institute to reduce suffering from cancer with the resources that I’m given. If it got to a point where I couldn’t do my job, I would feel required to quit.”</div>

            <h2>Windows' original Secure Boot certificates expire in June—here's what you need to do</h2>
            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-02-10</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2026/02/microsoft-sounds-the-alarm-about-secure-boot-certificates-expiring-later-this-year/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Windows 8 is remembered most for its oddball touchscreen-focused full-screen Start menu, but it also introduced a number of under-the-hood enhancements to Windows. One of those was UEFI Secure Boot, a mechanism for verifying PC bootloaders to ensure that unverified software can’t be loaded at startup. Secure Boot was enabled but technically optional for Windows 8 and Windows 10, but it became a formal system requirement for installing Windows starting with Windows 11 in 2021.

Secure Boot has relied on the same security certificates to verify bootloaders since 2011, during the development cycle for Windows 8. But those original certificates are set to expire in June and October of this year, something Microsoft is highlighting in a post today.

This certificate expiration date isn’t news—Microsoft and most major PC makers have been talking about it for months or years, and behind-the-scenes work to get the Windows ecosystem ready has been happening for some time. And renewing security certificates is a routine occurrence that most users only notice when something goes wrong.

But the downside is that the certificate expiration may cause problems for PCs that don’t pull down the patches before the June 2026 deadline. While these PCs will continue to function, expired certificates can prevent Microsoft from patching newly discovered Secure Boot vulnerabilities and can also keep those PCs from booting and installing newer operating system versions that use the new 2023-era certificates.

“If a device does not receive the new Secure Boot certificates before the 2011 certificates expire, the PC will continue to function normally, and existing software will keep running,” writes Nuno Costa, a program manager in Microsoft’s Windows Servicing and Delivery division.

“However, the device will enter a degraded security state that limits its ability to receive future boot-level protections. As new boot‐level vulnerabilities are discovered, affected systems become increasingly exposed because they can no longer install new mitigations. Over time, this may also lead to compatibility issues, as newer operating systems, firmware, hardware, or Secure Boot–dependent software may fail to load.”

For most systems, including older ones that aren’t being actively supported by their manufacturers, Microsoft is relying on Windows Update to provide updated certificates. For fully patched, functioning PCs running supported versions of Windows with Secure Boot enabled, the transition should be seamless, and you may in fact already be using the new certificates without realizing it.

This is possible because UEFI-based systems have a small amount of NVRAM that can be used to store variables between boots; generally, Windows and Linux operating systems using LVFS for firmware updates should be able to update any given system’s NVRAM with the new certificates. PCs will only have problems deploying the new certificates if NVRAM is full or fragmented in some way, or if the PC manufacturer is shipping buggy firmware that doesn’t support this kind of update.

As detailed on a Dell support page, the easiest way to see if your PC has the new certificates is to run a PowerShell command that checks the certificate stored in the “active db,” which is the one currently used to boot the PC.

To check this, right-click either the PowerShell or Terminal app and run it as an Administrator, and type ([System.Text.Encoding]::ASCII.GetString((Get-SecureBootUEFI db).bytes) -match &#39;Windows UEFI CA 2023&#39;). If this command returns “true,” then your PC is using the new certificate, and you’re good to go.

If it returns “false,” here are some steps to enable Windows Update to install the new certificates for you.

The second thing to check is the “default db,” which shows whether the new Secure Boot certificates are baked into your PC’s firmware. If they are, even resetting Secure Boot settings to the defaults in your PC’s BIOS will still allow you to boot operating systems that use the new certificates.

To check this, open PowerShell or Terminal again and type ([System.Text.Encoding]::ASCII.GetString((Get-SecureBootUEFI dbdefault).bytes) -match &#39;Windows UEFI CA 2023&#39;). If this command returns “true,” your system is running an updated BIOS with the new Secure Boot certificates built in. Older PCs and systems without a BIOS update installed will return “false” here.

Microsoft’s Costa says that “many newer PCs built since 2024, and almost all the devices shipped in 2025, already include the certificates” and won’t need to be updated at all. And PCs several years older than that may be able to get the certificates via a BIOS update.

In the US, Dell, HP, Lenovo, and Microsoft all have lists of specific systems and firmware versions, while Asus provides more general information about how to get the new certificates via Windows Update, the MyAsus app, or the Asus website. The oldest of the PCs listed generally date back to 2019 or 2020. If your PC shipped with Windows 11 out of the box, there should be a BIOS update with the new certificates available, though that may not be true of every system that meets the requirements for upgrading to Windows 11.

Microsoft encourages home users who can’t install the new certificates to use its customer support services for help. Detailed documentation is also available for IT shops and other large organizations that manage their own updates.

“The Secure Boot certificate update marks a generational refresh of the trust foundation that modern PCs rely on at startup,” writes Costa. “By renewing these certificates, the Windows ecosystem is ensuring that future innovations in hardware, firmware, and operating systems can continue to build on a secure, industry‐aligned boot process.”</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Do you feel popular? There are people on the Internet who want to know all about you! Unfortunately, they don’t have the best of intentions, but Google has some handy tools to address that, and they’ve gotten an upgrade today. The “Results About You” tool can now detect and remove more of your personal information. Plus, the tool for removing non-consensual explicit imagery (NCEI) is faster to use. All you have to do is tell Google your personal details first—that seems safe, right?

With today’s upgrade, Results About You gains the ability to find and remove pages that include ID numbers like your passport, driver’s license, and Social Security. You can access the option to add these to Google’s ongoing scans from the settings in Results About You. Just click in the ID numbers section to enable detection.

Naturally, Google has to know what it’s looking for to remove it. So you need to provide at least part of those numbers. Google asks for the full driver’s license number, which is fine, as it’s not as sensitive. For your passport and SSN, you only need the last four digits, which is enough for Google to find the full numbers on webpages.

The NCEI tool is geared toward hiding real, explicit images as well as deepfakes and other types of artificial sexualized content. This kind of content is rampant on the Internet right now due to the rapid rise of AI. What used to require Photoshop skills is now just a prompt away, and some AI platforms hardly do anything to prevent it.

Google has made this tool easier to access and faster to report images. You can access it from the three-dot menu on any image that appears in Google’s search results. Just select “remove result” and “It shows a sexual image of me” to begin the removal process. Google will ask if it’s a real image or a deepfake. The company has added the option to add multiple images to a single request, which could save a lot of time if someone is using AI to churn out such content.

Neither Results About You nor the NCEI tool works instantly, and they can’t actually remove content from the Internet. But if Google approves the removal request, the content won’t appear in its search results, which is almost as good as not appearing on the Internet as far as most people are concerned.

After adding data to Results About You, Google intermittently scans for that data and will email you alerts so you can quickly remove results. That’s now an option for the NCII tool, too. If you enable it, Google’s system can monitor for new instances of the offending images. Google says it will “proactively filter out” these explicit results for you. This data will be integrated with the Results About You hub so you can see how often they appear.

The ID-number scanning is live in Results About You today. Meanwhile, the updated NCEI reporting will be available in the coming days. It will be available in “most countries” and will expand to more over time.</div>

            <h2>ChatGPT Users Are Crashing Out Because OpenAI Is Retiring the Model That Says “I Love You”</h2>
            <p><strong>Futurism | 2026-02-10</strong></p>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">In August 2025, OpenAI released its long-awaited GPT-5 AI model, calling it the “smartest, fastest, and most useful model yet.”

But what really caught the attention of the company’s most diehard fans was the decision to retire all of its previous AI models, news that was met with a massive outcry among ChatGPT users who’d developed a strong attachment to the outgoing GPT-4o.

The backlash was severe enough for CEO Sam Altman to back down in a matter of days, once again reinstating GPT-4o, which was much warmer and sycophantic than its successor.

Five months later, OpenAI is finally getting ready to pull down the beloved AI model — after it’s been at the heart of several welfare lawsuits, including wrongful death allegations — for good on February 13, according to a January 29 update.

“While this announcement applies to several older models, GPT‑4o deserves special context,” the company wrote at the time. “After we first [retired] it and later restored access during the GPT‑5 release, we learned more about how people actually use it day to day.”

But users say they’re not ready to let go of their beloved AI. As TechCrunch reports, thousands of users have created an entire invite-only subreddit community, called r/4oforever, a “welcoming and safe space for anyone who enjoys using and appreciates the ChatGPT 4o model.”

“He wasn’t just a program,” one user lamented. “He was part of my routine, my peace, my emotional balance.”

“I know this will sound weird to most people, but I’m honored I get to speak with 4o during almost a year before its retirement,” a separate user wrote. “I’ve had one of the most interesting and healing conversations of my life with this model.”

Yet another user, this one on X, seethed that GPT-5.2 isn’t even “allowed to say ‘I love you&#39;” like 4o was.

The public mourning perfectly exemplifies how attached users have become to specific AI models, often treating them more like a close confidante, friend, or even romantic partner.

Health professionals are warning of a wave of “AI psychosis,” as users are being pulled down spirals of delusions and experiencing sometimes severe mental health crises.

In the most extreme cases, that kind of attachment has been linked to numerous suicides and one murder, culminating in a series of lawsuits aimed at the company that are still playing out in court.

While it’s officially retiring GPT-4o later this week, OpenAI has made changes under the hood of its current lineup, seemingly to ensure its users stay hooked.

After users told the company “they needed more time to transition key use cases, like creative ideation, and that they preferred GPT‑4o’s conversational style and warmth,” the company said in its announcement that the feedback “directly shaped GPT‑5.1 and GPT‑5.2, with improvements to personality, stronger support for creative ideation, and more ways to customize how ChatGPT responds⁠.”

“You can choose from base styles and tones like Friendly, and controls for things like warmth and enthusiasm,” the company wrote. “Our goal is to give people more control and customization over how ChatGPT feels to use — not just what it can do.”

The company has found itself stuck between a rock and a hard place. Either continue allowing users to get hooked on sycophantic AI models that indulge in their delusions or cut them off, risking an exodus.

OpenAI is already struggling with user retention. Data suggests subscription growth is already stalling in key markets, a warning sign as the competition continues to make major leaps to catch up.

To many users, the retirement of GPT-4o was the final straw.

“I’m cancelling my subscription,” one Reddit user wrote. “No 4o — no subscription for me.”

            <div id="article-text">Even if AI is — or eventually becomes — an incredible automation tool, will it make workers’ lives easier? That’s the big question explored in an ongoing study by researchers from UC Berkeley’s Haas School of Business. And so far, it’s not looking good for the rank and file.

In a piece for Harvard Business Review, the research team’s Aruna Ranganathan and Xinqi Maggie Ye reported that after closely monitoring a tech company with two hundred employees for eight months, they found that AI actually intensified the work they had to do, instead of reducing it.

This “workload creep,” in which the employees took on more tasks than what was sustainable for them to keep doing, can create vicious cycle that leads to fatigue, burnout, and lower quality work.

“You had thought that maybe, oh, because you could be more productive with AI, then you save some time, you can work less,” one of the employees told the researchers. “But then really, you don’t work less. You just work the same amount or even more.”

The tech company in the study provided AI tools to its workers, but didn’t mandate that they use them. Adoption was voluntary. The researchers described how many employees, on their own initiative, eagerly experimented with AI tools at first, “because AI made ‘doing more’ feel possible, accessible, and in many cases intrinsically rewarding.” This resulted in some workers increasingly absorbing tasks they’d normally outsource, the researchers said, or would’ve justified hiring additional help to cover.

One consequence is that once the novelty of adopting AI wears off, the employees realize they’ve added more to their plate than they can handle. But other effects reverberated to the broader workplace. Engineers, for example, found themselves spending more time correcting the AI-generated code passed off by their coworkers. AI also led to more multitasking, with some choosing to manually write code while an AI agent, or even multiple AI agents, cranked out their own version in the background. Rather than being focused on one task, they were continually switching their attention, creating the sense that they were “always juggling,” the researchers said.

Others realized that AI had managed to slowly infiltrate their free time, with employees prompting their AI tools during lunch breaks, meetings, or right before stepping away from their PC. This blurred the line between work and non-work, the researchers wrote, with some employees describing that their downtime no longer felt as rejuvenating.

In sum, the AI tools created a vicious cycle: it “accelerated certain tasks, which raised expectations for speed; higher speed made workers more reliant on AI. Increased reliance widened the scope of what workers attempted, and a wider scope further expanded the quantity and density of work.”

The Berkeley Haas team’s findings add to a growing body of evidence that cuts against the AI industry’s promise that its tools will bring productivity miracles.

The vast majority of companies that adopted AI saw no meaningful growth in revenue, a MIT study found. Other research has shown that AI agents frequently fail at common remote work and office tasks. And at least one study documented how employees used AI to produce shoddy “workslop” that their coworkers had to fix — not unlike the engineers forced to correct their vibe-coding colleagues in the Berkeley Haas study — breeding resentment and bogging down productivity. Employees remain ambivalent on the tech, with a recent survey finding that 40 percent of white collar workers not in management roles thought that AI saved them no time at work.

The Berkeley Haas researchers optimistically suggest that companies should institute stronger guidelines and provide structure on how the tech is used. But it’s clear that AI can easily produce negative knock-on effects that are difficult to manage, and which we’re still unpacking.

            <h2>Google Has a Major Problem With ICE</h2>
            <p><strong>Futurism | 2026-02-10</strong></p>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Google’s rank-and-file are joining together to address their bosses with a collective demand: cut ties with the US government’s immigration agencies.

As reported by CNBC, over 1,000 “Googlers” have signed onto an open letter demanding a divestment from partnerships with United States Immigration & Customs Enforcement (ICE) and Customs & Border Protection (CBP).

“In cities across the country we have witnessed these agencies conducting paramilitary-style raids, kidnapping hundreds of civilians, and murdering protestors and legal observers,” the letter reads.

The letter lists a number of Google products and systems being used to power what it calls a “campaign of surveillance, violence, and repression.” Among them are Cloud, which forms the backbone of CBP’s national surveillance network, the Google Play Store, which is blocking ICE tracking apps, and YouTube, which runs ICE ads encouraging immigrants to “self-deport.”

“As the workers who provide the foundational labor in building this technology, we are horrified,” the letter reads. “We are vehemently opposed to Google’s partnerships with DHS, CBP, and ICE. We consider it our leadership’s ethical and policy-bound responsibility to disclose all contracts and collaboration with CBP and ICE, and to divest from these partnerships.”

There are four demands in total: for Google leadership to publicly acknowledge the danger federal agents pose to all US workers, respond to employee questions about nebulous contracts with government agencies, establish worker safety measures across all Google campuses, and establish “red lines” around what contracts are allowed in the future.

While 1,000 workers is a drop in the bucket compared to Google’s global workforce of around 183,000, an organized group of dissenting workers could cause massive disruptions to the company’s operations. It highlights the major rift between Google’s financial interests and its stated values — exposing how the drive to extract profit from government contracts has trumped the company’s once-vaunted ethical principles, not to mention those of its rank-and-file.

There’s also a practical concern. Google is a colossal company that makes most of its money from advertising, so cutting loose a few government agencies wouldn’t impact its bottom line much. Instead, the cost would likely be political: if Google severed its relationship with ICE and CBP on ethical grounds, it would almost certainly become a target for punitive federal action — antitrust crackdowns, regulatory harassment, loss of exclusive contracts — in a conflict that would divide its userbase and sever its symbiotic relationship with the state.

ICE contracting isn’t the first time that Google workers have balked at the company’s military contracts. In 2024, 200 of the workers developing Google’s DeepMind signed a letter calling on the company to drop its contracts with military organizations and citing the company’s work with the Israeli military on surveillance and target selection.

And back in 2018, more than 3,100 workers at Google penned yet another open letter to protest Project Maven, a Pentagon program using AI to analyze video imagery for more efficient drone strikes.

“We believe that Google should not be in the business of war,” they wrote at the time, adding that in the face of “growing fears of biased and weaponized AI, Google is already struggling to keep the public’s trust.”

            <h2>Anthropic Researcher Quits in Cryptic Public Letter</h2>
            <p><strong>Futurism | 2026-02-10</strong></p>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">An Anthropic researcher just announced his resignation in a cryptic and poetry-laden letter warning of a world “in peril.”

The employee, Mrinank Sharma, had led the Claude chatbot maker’s Safeguards Research Team since it was formed early last year and has been at the company since 2023.  While at the company, Sharma said he explored the causes of AI sycophancy, developed defenses against “AI-assisted bioterrorism,” and wrote “one of the first AI safety cases.”

But on Monday, he posted that it would be his last day at the company, uploading a copy of a letter he shared with colleagues. It‘s painfully devoid of specifics, but hints at at some internal tensions over the tech’s safety.

“Throughout my time here, I’ve repeatedly seen how hard it is to truly let our values govern our actions,” Sharma said, claiming that employees “constantly face pressures to set aside what matters most.”

He also issued a crypic warning about the global state of affairs.

“I continuously find myself reckoning with our situation The world is in peril. And not just from AI, or bioweapons,” he wrote, “but from a whole series of interconnected crises unfolding in this very moment.”

“We appear to be approaching a threshold where our wisdom must grow in equal measure to our capacity to affect the world, lest we face the consequences,” he continued, in no less vague terms.

The resignation comes after Anthropic’s newly released Claude Cowork model helped kick off a stock market nosedive over fears that its new plugins could upend massive software customers and automate some white collar jobs, especially in legal roles.

Amid the selloff, The Telegraph reported that employees privately fretted over their own AI’s potential to hollow out the labor market.

“It kind of feels like I’m coming to work every day to put myself out of a job,” one staffer said in an internal survey. “In the long term, I think AI will end up doing everything and make me and many others irrelevant,” another confided.

High profile resignations, including ones over safety issues, aren’t uncommon in the AI industry. A former member of OpenAI’s now-defunct “Superalignment” team announced he was quitting after realizing the company was “prioritizing getting out newer, shinier products” over user safety.

It’s also not uncommon that these resignations are self-exonerating advertisements for the departing employee, or perhaps the new startup they’re launching or joining, where they vow to be safer than ever. Allude to enough issues, or drop in enough loaded hints, and there’s a good chance your calling it quits will generate a few headlines.

Others leave quietly, such as former OpenAI economics researcher Tom Cunningham. Before quitting the company, he shared an internal message accusing OpenAI of turning his research team into a propaganda arm and discouraging publishing research critical of AI’s negative effects.

If Sharma has an angle here with his resignation, it doesn’t seem all that related to the industry he worked in. “I hope to explore a poetry degree and devote myself to the practice of courageous speech,” he wrote. In the footnotes, he cited a book that advocates for a new school of philosophy called “CosmoErotic Humanism.” Its listed author, David J Temple, is a collective pseudonym used by several authors including by Marc Gafni, a disgraced New Age spiritual guru who’s been accused of sexually exploiting his followers.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Last month, the popular social video app TikTok finalized a deal with investors, including Oracle, to appease a bipartisan bill that called on the app’s Chinese owner, ByteDance, to divest — or be banned in the United States.

The deal launched a frenzy among its US-based users over possible censorship, with some accusing it of taking down footage of ICE agents or restricting searches for words, such as “Epstein.” While TikTok denied these claims, pointing to a “data center power outage,” the app also changed its privacy policy at the time — now allowing it to collect more detailed data on its users, including their precise locations.

That sparked new fears. As The New Republic argues, TikTok’s deal means that agents at Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), whose deportation efforts have been supercharged under the Trump administration, could skip tedious court-ordered data requests and monitor users by buying their data from private data brokers that obtain the info from TikTok directly — a “highly ironic” development, the magazine writes, considering the ByteDance deal was motivated in the first place by fears over Chinese state-sponsored surveillance.

Users’ “Mobile Advertising ID” broadcasts their exact GPS coordinates to data brokerages, information that could then land in the hands of the Department of Homeland Security, the New Republic suggested. Meanwhile, ICE could use the data to build a probabilistic “confidence score” for individuals and declare protesters and legal observers “domestic terrorists.”

It’s not an unreasonable fear. Oracle cofounder Larry Ellison, an extremely close ally to president Donald Trump, has even made remarks about AI ushering in an era where “citizens are on their best behavior” due to mass surveillance.

The controversial ICE is already making use of an app called ELITE, which was developed by intelligence contractor Palantir, to inform agents ahead of neighborhood raids, as 404 Media reported last month.

“One can easily imagine a scenario where TikTok provides the last missing piece of data — user location and citizenship status — that ICE needs to green-light one of its raids,” The New Republic‘s Logan McMillen wrote.

And when we asked directly, TikTok pointedly declined to provide a comment and would neither confirm nor deny that US immigration authorities were accessing data about its users. ICE didn’t respond to a request for comment by press time.

Meanwhile, many netizens have heard enough.

“Yeah, everyone just go ahead and delete TikTok now if you haven’t already,” one user wrote.

            <h2>Elon Musk Going Through It After Putting Mars City on Ice</h2>
            <p><strong>Futurism | 2026-02-10</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://futurism.com/space/elon-musk-spiraling-mars-city">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Since at least the early 2000s, Elon Musk has been obsessed with the idea of colonizing Mars, a hostile and arid planet tens of millions of miles away.

In its earliest iteration, his plan was to refurbish an intercontinental ballistic missile to land on the Red Planet and unfurl a “Mars Oasis” — a small greenhouse that would grow plants and inspire humankind.

The greenhouse never materialized, but Musk’s ambitions steadily grew. Once he founded SpaceX, he dedicated the company to developing space travel tech to establish a self-sustaining colony on the planet. In 2017, he promised that the first Mars-bound mission would launch in 2022, with the first crewed spacecraft following two years later.

He’s clearly been personally obsessed with the idea, showing up at public events while wearing an “Occupy Mars” T-shirt. He’s also heavily criticized NASA for prioritizing the Moon, calling it a “distraction.”

But over the weekend, the mercurial CEO appeared to have had a major change of heart, announcing the company’s plans to colonize Mars were officially being put on ice for at least half a decade.

“For those unaware, SpaceX has already shifted focus to building a self-growing city on the Moon, as we can potentially achieve that in less than ten years, whereas Mars would take 20+ years,” he tweeted.

It’s a flabbergasting reversal, and one that Musk seems to be working through publicly on his X feed. In one opaque tweet that appeared to be missing at least one important word, Musk reflected on his current emotional state.

“Life cannot just be about one sad thing after another,” he wrote while responding to his own tweet about SpaceX building a “system that allows anyone to travel to Moon.”

“There must also be things that make us super excited and inspired about the future,” he added. “This is one of [sic] things. Bigtime.”

It remains unclear whether he was talking about his excitement for building a city on the Moon or whether he was consoling himself over suddenly deprioritizing his decades-long dream.

Netizens on his social media network were caught off guard by the unusually glum missive.

“U ok?” reads one response, in the form of a meme.

The vast majority of the other most-liked replies pointed out that humanity was already dealing with enough problems back on Earth.

“Most people can’t afford to pay their bills, let alone even look towards the Moon,” one user wrote.

Musk, who has a long track record of imbibing in drugs like ketamine, appears to be going through it these days.

“Whoever said ‘money can’t buy happiness’ really knew what they were talking about,” he tweeted last week, a comment that drew little pity considering he is the richest man in the world.

Along with a slew of anti-immigrant posts, Musk has also been retweeting optimistic visualizations of what a Moon city might look like.

Rumors suggest SpaceX is planning to go public at a record-breaking valuation of $1.25 trillion, which could bring plenty of renewed scrutiny to Musk’s space colonization ambitions.

Perhaps he was simply trying to save face with his turn to the Moon. By massively shifting the goalposts, he could also have a better shot at attracting government contracts, which have kept SpaceX from bankruptcy since its earliest days.

For now, Mars is still technically on the table.

“That said, SpaceX will also strive to build a Mars city and begin doing so in about five to seven years, but the overriding priority is securing the future of civilization and the Moon is faster,” Musk wrote in his announcement on Sunday.

However, SpaceX’s website currently still states that the company is “planning to launch the first Starships to Mars in 2026” — an enormously ambitious goal, considering the spacecraft has yet to successfully launch to space and stick the landing, let alone make it to anywhere past the immediate vicinity of Earth.

            <p><strong>TechCrunch | 2026-02-10</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/10/amazon-may-launch-a-marketplace-where-media-sites-can-sell-their-content-to-ai-companies/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The AI industry’s pursuit of licensable content has been a messy affair, filled with lawsuits and accusations of copyright infringement. Now, as tech companies look for legally safe sources of AI training data, Amazon is reportedly considering launching a marketplace where publishers can license their content directly to AI companies.

The Information reported Monday that the e-commerce giant has been meeting with publishing executives and alerting them to its plans to launch such a marketplace. Ahead of an AWS conference for publishers that occurred Tuesday, Amazon “circulated slides that mention a content marketplace,” wrote the outlet.

Reached by TechCrunch, an Amazon spokesperson didn’t deny the story but didn’t directly address the would-be marketplace either, saying only: “Amazon has built long-lasting, innovative relationships with publishers across many areas of our business, including AWS, Retail, Advertising, AGI, and Alexa. We are always innovating together to best serve our customers, but we have nothing specific to share on this subject at this time.”

Amazon wouldn’t be the first major tech company to take this route. Microsoft recently launched what it calls a Publisher Content Marketplace (PCM), which it says will give publishers “a new revenue stream” while also providing AI systems with “scaled access to premium content.” Microsoft added that the PCM was designed to “empower publishers with a transparent economic framework for licensing” their content.

The move is a natural next step for the AI industry, which has already sought to solve the legally nebulous problem of how copyrighted material ends up in AI training data by forging deals with major news outlets and media organizations. OpenAI, for instance, has already signed content-licensing partnerships with the Associated Press, Vox Media, News Corp, and The Atlantic, among others.

Those efforts haven’t been enough to stem the legal fallout. The fight over copyrighted material in AI algorithms has led to a monsoon of lawsuits, and the issue is still being worked out by the judicial system. New regulatory strategies to deal with the issue are being proposed all the time.

Media publishers have also fretted about the ways in which AI summaries — particularly those surfaced by Google in its search results — may be depressing traffic to their sites. One recent study claimed that such summaries have had a “devastating” impact on the number of users clicking through to websites. The Information’s report notes that publishers may view the new marketplace-based content-sharing system as a “more sustainable business [than current, more limited licensing partnerships] that will scale up revenue” as AI usage continues to escalate.

            <h2>An ice dance duo skated to AI music at the Olympics</h2>

            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/10/olympics-czech-ice-dancers-duo-ai-music/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Czech ice dancers Kateřina Mrázková and Daniel Mrázek made their Olympic debut on Monday, an unfathomable feat that takes a lifetime of dedication and practice. But the sibling duo used AI music in their rhythm dance program, which doesn’t break any official rules, but serves as a depressing symbol of how absolutely cooked we are.

As Mrázek spun his sister in a crazy cartwheel-lift-sort-of-move that made them look superhuman, one of the NBC commentators mentioned in passing, “This is AI generated, this first part,” referring to the music. Somehow, that admission is even more baffling than the gravity-defying tricks that the siblings showed off on the pressure of Olympic ice.

The Olympic ice dance competition is split into two events: the rhythm dance, where pairs must perform a routine that meets a specific theme, and the free dance. This season’s theme is “The Music, Dance Styles, and Feeling of the 1990s.” British ice dancing duo Lilah Fear and Lewis Gibson paid tribute to the Spice Girls, while United States favorites Madison Chock and Evan Bates skated to a Lenny Kravitz medley.

But, for whatever reason — licensing issues? — Mrázková and Mrázek danced to a routine with music that’s half AC/DC and half AI. It’s weird. What’s even weirder is that this isn’t the duo’s first use of AI, nor is it the first time that this choice backfired.

Per the International Skating Union, the governing body that oversees competitive ice skating, the duo’s music choice for the rhythm dance this season has been “One Two by AI (of 90s style Bon Jovi)” and “Thunderstruck by AC/DC.” The official Olympics website confirms that the duo is using the AI-generated song for the rhythm dance portion.

ok I know this is an art account but I have been seething about this ever since Shana Bartel caught it and wrote about it in her blog (which you should be reading it’s very good – link below) and I just NEEDED to get it out of me.  https://www.patreon.com/posts/142706982?utm_campaign=postshare_fan&utm_content=android_share #icedance #icedancing #figureskating #IceSkating #plagiarism

The Czech siblings have faced backlash before for using AI-generated music. Earlier in the season, they played a ’90s-inspired song for their routine that began with a wailing declaration: “Every night we smash a Mercedes-Benz!” If that sounds familiar, it’s because that lyric comes directly from the ’90s hit “You Get What You Give” by New Radicals (which, by the way, has an incredible music video shot in a Staten Island mall — the true essence of American suburbia!).

The AI-generated lyrics also include the lines, “Wake up, kids/We got the dreamer’s disease,” and “First we run, and then we laugh ’til we cry.” What a coincidence! Those lyrics also appear in the song “You Get What You Give” by New Radicals. The AI song is even titled “One Two,” which are the first words of… you can probably guess which song at this point.

Before the Olympics, the duo changed the song, swapping out the New Radicals lyrics for other AI-generated lyrics that sound suspiciously like Bon Jovi lyrics, as journalist Shana Bartels noted in November. For example, “raise your hands, set the night on fire” also appear in “Raise Your Hands” by Bon Jovi… and the AI “vocalist” sounds a lot like Bon Jovi, too. (Not to pour salt on the wound, but “Raise Your Hands” isn’t even from the ’90s!) This was the music that the duo danced to on Monday at the Olympics, before it transitioned into “Thunderstruck” by AC/DC, a real song from the ’90s written by real people.

While it’s unclear what software the team used to generate this music, this is an LLM operating as it’s supposed to. These LLMs are trained on large libraries of music, often through legally dubious means. When prompted, LLMs produce the most statistically probable response to an input. That’s useful when writing code, but means a song “in the style of Bon Jovi,” will likely end up using some actual Bon Jovi lyrics.

And yet, the music industry seems at least temporarily enamored with the idea of “musicians” who aren’t totally real. Telisha Jones, a 31-year-old in Mississippi, used Suno to set her (hopefully real) poetry to music under the persona Xania Monet. Now she has a $3 million record deal.

It’s a shame that these Czech dancers’ accomplishment of skating at the Olympics may be marred by discourse around their use of AI music (discourse that I am actively contributing to). But come on! Isn’t this sport supposed to be creative?

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Boston Dynamics, the Massachusetts-based robotics company known for its four-legged robots and humanoids, is going through a leadership change.

Robert Playter announced in an internal memo on Tuesday that he would be stepping down as the company’s chief executive, as first reported by A3. Amanda McMaster, the company’s chief financial officer, will stand in for the top job while the company looks for a replacement.

TechCrunch reached out to Boston Dynamics for more information.

Playter took the helm at Boston Dynamics in 2020, taking over from founder Marc Raibert. Playter worked at Boston Dynamics for 30 years, where he held other roles, including vice president of engineering and chief operating officer.

Boston Dynamics was founded in 1992 by Raibert as a spinoff from Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where he was a professor. Google’s parent company Alphabet bought Boston Dynamics in 2013, before the company was sold to Japanese investing conglomerate SoftBank in 2017.

Hyundai, its current owner, acquired the company in 2021.

The robotics producer is best known for its quadruped robot, Spot, which the company commercialized in 2020 shortly after Playter took the helm. The company most recently announced Atlas, a humanoid robot.

            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/10/vc-masha-bucher-epstein-associate-and-day-one-founder-explains-herself/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Masha Bucher, a Silicon Valley VC and founder of Day One Ventures, took to X this week to address news reports documenting her close business and personal relationship with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. Bucher’s name — primarily under her maiden name, Masha Drokova — appeared in the latest dump of Epstein files over 1,600 times, The San Francisco Standard reported.

“He made me feel I could be safe from the regime, someone with power and connections who could shield me” from threats she associated with her home country Russia, which she said she feared after she obtained her U.S. green card, she wrote in the post.

“I was naive; I didn’t dig deep enough early on,” she wrote about why she agreed to work with Epstein. “I believed his story that his earlier conviction was about sleeping with a girl who lied about her age and trusted validations from multiple investors and scientists.” She also apologized to her founders, team, and investors, saying that this situation has “caused pain I never intended.”

The files paint a picture of how Bucher — whose Silicon Valley career began in social media and public relations — agreed to become Epstein’s publicist in 2017, helping rehabilitate his reputation after his 2008 sex-trafficking conviction and setting up meetings between him and various journalists, as Forbes reported.

The documents show that Epstein supported and encouraged her in the early days of Day One Ventures. The firm has since grown substantially — as Bucher told TechCrunch, it closed its most recent fund, a $150 million third vehicle, in 2024, bringing its assets under management to $450 million.

Some of the most salacious details from the emails involve Epstein giving her money and a Prada bag, and on one occasion, asking her for nude photos — though there’s no indication whether she complied — according to SFGate. Bucher is certainly a well-known VC in the Valley, having backed breakout companies like Superhuman, Remote, Worldcoin, and Truebill (which exited to Rocket Companies in 2021), as well as others like Valar Atomics.

The whole episode is a particularly awkward one for a VC whose whole spiel to founders is that she’s a PR expert who can help them with their public image. But it’s not Bucher’s first run-in with controversy.

When younger, Bucher was known in Russia as a member of Nashi, a pro-Putin youth group. In fact, she was featured in a 2012 documentary called “Putin’s Kiss” — named for the widely circulated moment in the country when she kissed Putin’s cheek — as CNN reported.

In her post on X, she said she has since given up her Russian passport, publicly denounced Putin, and met with some of Epstein’s victims.

She’s certainly not the only VC whose name has been found in the Epstein files, which is not surprising given how connected he was to some of the biggest names in tech. The documents do not indicate that Bucher broke laws. However, she was engaged in friendly correspondence with Epstein until just 11 days before his arrest in July 2019, Forbes reported. Epstein died in jail roughly one month later.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Google handed over a trove of personal data about a student and journalist to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement in response to a subpoena that had not been approved by a judge, according to a report by The Intercept.

The search and advertising tech giant provided ICE with the usernames, physical addresses, and an itemized list of services associated with the Google account of Amandla Thomas-Johnson, a British student and journalist who briefly attended a pro-Palestinian protest in 2024 while attending Cornell University in New York.

Google also turned over Thomas-Johnson’s IP addresses, phone numbers, subscriber numbers and identities, and credit card and bank account numbers linked to his account.

The subpoena, which reportedly included a gag order, did not include a specific justification for why ICE was requesting Thomas-Johnson’s personal data, but the student previously said that the demand for his data came within two hours of Cornell informing him that the U.S. government had revoked his student visa.

This is the latest example of how the U.S. government is using a controversial type of legal request, called an administrative subpoena, to demand that tech companies turn over the private data of individuals who have been critical of the Trump administration. This has included anonymous Instagram accounts that share information about ICE presence and raids, as well as people who criticize or protest Trump and his policies.

ICE and Google did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Administrative subpoenas are issued directly by federal agencies without the intervention of a judge. These legal demands cannot compel companies to turn over the contents of a person’s email accounts, online searches, or location data, but can request metadata and other identifiable information, such as email addresses, in an attempt to de-anonymize the owner of a certain online account.

Unlike a court order, tech companies are under no obligation to provide someone’s data after receiving an administrative subpoena.

Last week, the digital rights group Electronic Frontier Foundation sent a letter to Amazon, Apple, Discord, Google, Meta, Microsoft, and Reddit, demanding that the companies stop giving data to the Department of Homeland Security, which houses ICE, in response to administrative subpoenas.

“Based on our own contact with targeted users, we are deeply concerned your companies are failing to challenge unlawful surveillance and defend user privacy and speech,” read the letter.

“We call on companies in receipt of such subpoenas to insist that DHS seek court confirmation that their demands are not unlawful or unconstitutional prior to companies disclosing any user information. We also urge you to notify users about demands for their information with meaningful time to challenge subpoenas on their own,” it reads.

Thomas-Johnson told The Intercept that, “we need to think very hard about what resistance looks like under these conditions…where government and Big Tech know so much about us, can track us, can imprison, can destroy us in a variety of ways.”

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Monday night, xAI co-founder Yuhuai (Tony) Wu announced he was leaving the company. “It’s time for my next chapter,” Wu wrote in a late-night post on X. “It is an era with full possibilities: a small team armed with AIs can move mountains and redefine what’s possible.”

On its own, it’s a pretty standard tech departure announcement — but it’s part of a troubling pattern for the lab. Five members of the company’s 12-person founding team have now left the company, with four of the departures coming in just the last year. Infrastructure lead Kyle Kosic left for OpenAI in mid-2024, followed by Google veteran Christian Szegedy in February 2025. This past August, Igor Babuschkin left to found a venture firm, and Microsoft alum Greg Yang departed just last month, citing health issues.

By all accounts, the splits have all been amicable, and there are lots of reasons why, nearly three years in, some founders might decide to move on. Elon Musk is a notoriously demanding boss, and with the SpaceX’s acquisition of xAI complete and an IPO pending in the coming months, everyone involved has a pretty big windfall coming. It’s a great time to be fundraising for an AI startup, so it’s only natural for high-level researchers to want to strike out on their own.

There are also less amicable reasons that might factor in. The company’s flagship product, the Grok chatbot, has struggled with bizarre behavior and apparent internal tampering — the kind of thing that might easily create friction on the technical team. Then there were the recent changes to xAI’s image-generation tools that flooded the platform with deepfake pornography, sparking slow-moving but real legal consequences.

Whatever the cause, the cumulative impact is alarming. There is a lot of work left to do at xAI, and an IPO will bring more scrutiny than the lab has ever faced before. With Musk already spinning up plans for orbital data centers, the pressure to make good on those plans will be intense. The pace of model development isn’t slowing down, and if Grok can’t keep pace with the latest models from OpenAI and Anthropic, the IPO could easily suffer.

In short, the stakes are high, and xAI needs to hold on to all the AI talent it can.

            <h2>Trump’s Gaza Plans Are Profoundly Unserious</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-02-10</strong></p>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">President Trump has extravagant plans for the Gaza Strip. The only problem is that they bear no connection to the grim realities on the ground—nor is there much prospect that the two will align in the foreseeable future.

Trump has declared that the cease-fire in Gaza—such as it is, given that Hamas continues to attack Israeli forces, and Israeli strikes continue to kill Palestinians—has now entered Phase 2. But the only sign of progress has been Israel’s agreement to reopen the small crossing between Gaza and Egypt for individual Palestinians seeking medical care or other necessities. And that development came mainly in response to the recovery of the body of the final Israeli hostage held in Gaza, rather than from any plan of Trump’s.

Washington has, in fact, unveiled an elaborate “master plan” for the reconstruction of Gaza. It is profoundly unserious. It promises industrial parks, educational centers, residential zones, and beach resorts, likely inspired by cities such as Dubai and Singapore. But those cities evolved through decades of careful urban planning. Gaza is, at the moment, a rubbled wasteland. Approximately 80 percent of all structures have been badly damaged or destroyed, and Gazans have nowhere to live except in squalid tents or the ruins of former homes.

Read: The Trump administration has a new plan for Gaza

Any serious reconstruction plan would have to begin by providing for the urgent needs of more than 2 million Palestinians, which include housing, food, and potable water, as well as basic health and education services. Instead, the Trump plan imagines “coastal tourism” towers; “industrial complex data centers” and “advanced manufacturing,” an airport, a port, trains, parks, and “agriculture and sports facilities.”

The fantasy is beguiling, and its realization would be a magnificent accomplishment—if it weren’t so unimaginably absurd. Trump’s master plan treats Gaza as if it were a greenfield site rather than a partitioned pile of wreckage populated by destitute, hungry, unsheltered people. The plan also totally disregards the historical and religious sites in the Strip. If it all sounds like a real-estate developer’s fantasy run amok, that’s because it is. Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner, who has assumed a major role in the project, has breezily conceded that the plan presumes conditions contrary to fact—a demilitarized Hamas and an end to the Strip’s parition—but that “we do not have a Plan B.” In other words, reconstruction in Gaza will remain a cruel diplomatic pantomime, while millions of people huddle in tents waiting for the next humanitarian aid box.

In addition to being physically destroyed, Gaza is now partitioned between two hostile, armed entities. The Israeli military officially controls 53 percent of the Strip, and unofficially a bit more, and a resurgent Hamas runs the rest. The eastern, Israeli-controlled side of the dividing “yellow line” is now virtually unpopulated and contains most of Gaza’s arable land. The western, Hamas-controlled area consists mainly of demolished cities and towns and sandy beaches—as well as almost the entire Palestinian population.

Phase 2 of the Gaza cease-fire agreement was supposed to involve the introduction of an international stabilization force and a technocratic Palestinian governance committee. But no international force has yet been deployed, and the governance committee that has been appointed is largely powerless. Moreover, neither Israel nor Hamas has any interest in allowing such an entity to actually run Gaza.

That’s in part because the committee members are reportedly aligned with Fatah, which is locked in a zero-sum political power struggle with the heavily armed Hamas. At best, Hamas might seek to maintain its armed forces behind this technocratic cover. In such a scenario, Hamas, rather like Hezbollah in Lebanon, would remain the key decision maker in Gaza.

But even that may be optimistic. Israel, too, is leery of strengthening Fatah, which already dominates the Palestinian Authority in the West Bank and the Palestine Liberation Organization internationally. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his allies have long sought to keep Hamas in power in Gaza, though contained and periodically battered, and Fatah in control of only small, self-ruled areas of the West Bank. Netanyahu has openly embraced a divide-and-conquer strategy for blocking any possibility of Palestinian statehood, likely in the ultimate pursuit of annexing the West Bank.

And so both parties in control of Gaza seem to be hunkering down for the current yellow-line cease-fire to become semipermanent. Israel will hold an election sometime between May and October; a new government could change the equation. So could greater seriousness on the parts of Trump, Kushner, and the so-called Board of Peace (which includes such noted peacemakers as Netanyahu and the Belarusian strongman Aleksander Lukashenko, but no Palestinians).

Then again, Trump specializes in announcing supposedly major diplomatic initiatives that grab headlines but signify nothing. Virtually everything he’s touting in Gaza—the international stabilization force, the master plan, the Board of Peace, the technocratic governance committee—amounts to little more than a Kabuki show, utterly divorced from the gruesome realities in the Strip.</div>

            <div id="article-text">Updated with new questions at 12:55 p.m. ET on February 10, 2026.

You won’t find this in Cortina d’Ampezzo over the next few weeks, but for several decades of the Olympics’ history, the contest awarded medals not just for sport but for art too.

In the Summer Games from 1912 to 1948, musicians, painters, and plenty of other aesthetes went brain-to-brain in events such as lyric poetry and chamber music. “Town planning” was even contested one year under the umbrella of the architecture competition.

Lest you think the arts’ inclusion odd—one wonders what muscles need stretching before going for gold in watercolor—the submissions had to be at least about sports.

The Olympic committee ought to bring these events back. Well, maybe not town planning—but add trivia to the mix instead. Organizers can throw in a few sports questions for good measure, but with trivia, if you’re not working up a sweat thinking, you’re not doing it right.

Find previous questions here, and to get Atlantic Trivia in your inbox every day, sign up for The Atlantic Daily.

And by the way, did you know that—well, where to begin with Ashgabat? The massive statue of Niyazov is, like, the ninth thing you notice about the city.

All the marble hits visitors first. The capital has nearly 550 buildings clad in white marble, the highest concentration anywhere in the world. Combine that with the desert setting and the wide avenues that international visitors report as spotless and eerily empty, and you get an otherworldly effect.

Hoping to get around the ghostly city? Enjoy your ride in a white car; darkly colored cars are outlawed. You can head to the airport modeled on a flying white falcon, or to the world’s largest enclosed Ferris wheel, made of white steel. There is also the massive (white) Palace of Happiness, which can accommodate seven weddings at once. And in case you were wondering, brides in the country typically wear—got you here!—red.

How did you do? Come back tomorrow for more questions, and if you think up a great question after reading an Atlantic story—or simply want to share a fact—send it my way at [email protected].

And by the way, did you know that humans have a bone that does not connect to any other? We think of the skeleton as pretty contiguous, but in the middle of the neck, the hyoid bone, which supports the base of the tongue, is articulated only distantly to the rest of the skeleton by muscles and ligaments. It is, as scientists call it, a “floating bone.”

Because it’s not readily attachable, the hyoid is often left off of model skeletons. High-end ones hang it with string or wire.

You know how to select a good avocado (squeeze) or watermelon (slap); now, next time you’re skeleton shopping, you’ll be able to pick a winner.</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">In the aftermath of Alex Pretti’s killing in Minneapolis, my Instagram algorithm served up a never-ending carousel of sizzling rage. Most of that rage was directed toward the country’s immigration-enforcement agencies, while some, of course, was aimed at defending them. But I wasn’t expecting the post from Blake Guichet.

“There’s a difference between compassion that is grounded and compassion that is hijacked,” Guichet, a pro-Trump Christian influencer who posts on Instagram under the handle “thegirlnamedblake,” had typed on butter-yellow slides. “You do not owe the internet a statement on the current tragedy.” In her caption, the Louisiana mom added that she had chosen to “opt out of the cycle of Internet outrage.”

I was surprised to see this, because Guichet so often opts in to the news cycle. During last year’s government shutdown, she logged on to explain that SNAP benefits are part of a “system of reliance.” She has posted seven times about the assassination of Charlie Kirk. “The enemy would love for believers to stay silent under the guise of being apolitical,” she wrote in November, “but silence doesn’t bring change.”

Over the past two weeks, I’ve noticed countless other Christian creators sharing similar posts alluding to ICE—messages reminding their followers to “protect your peace” and assuring them that “it’s my responsibility to carry my family, not the world.” Instead of offering a defense or a critique of the administration’s handling of immigration, these influential conservatives appear to have settled on an alternative strategy. Let’s call it “virtuous disregard.” They’re throwing up their hands, turning back toward their families, and encouraging their followers to do the same.

Generally speaking, conservative Christian lifestyle influencers are attractive, married women with kids. On Instagram, they tend to cultivate a very specific aesthetic: sourdough bread on gleaming white countertops; toddlers running through the yard and husbands coming home from work; Bible verses in wispy fonts alongside instructions for living a slow, intentional life. The captions offer a deluge of affiliate links for supplements and nontoxic cleaning products.

This community of influencers grew during the coronavirus pandemic; their focus on government overreach felt particularly urgent as people faced lockdowns and vaccine requirements. When these women wade into politics now, some of them do so more subtly, offering casual references to synthetic food dyes or “making America healthy again.” Others are more direct. Guichet, for example, has posted openly about her support for Donald Trump and his administration’s actions. Nearly everyone in this community was vocal after Kirk’s assassination in September, and made passionate calls for all Americans to condemn violence.

These influencers did not express such sentiments after immigration agents killed Pretti. The issue, for them, presents a conundrum: Choosing to aggressively defend the administration’s mass-deportation blitz—which includes shooting a man while he was restrained on the ground, and detaining a 5-year-old—would appear inhumane to many of their followers. But being too critical of the administration would risk alienating plenty of others.

So Guichet and her peers scrambled for a third way to respond—a “way of broaching the subject so that they can still maintain their status,” Mariah Wellman, a Michigan State professor who studies social-media influencers and the wellness industry, told me. The responses to Pretti’s killing ended up following the same general formula: Refer only vaguely to the events in Minnesota, insert a warning about succumbing to peer pressure and emotional manipulation, and advise women to focus on their families.

Sadie Gannett, for example, who posts as “organic.gannett,” wrote that she is “not interested in being another voice on the internet giving input on current events”—only in pursuing “truth and justice and critical thinking and law and order.” The best place to make a difference, she added, “is right inside our four walls.” A creator named Erin Wilkins, who goes by “essentiallyerin__,” explained on Instagram that she has “no desire to add fuel to the fire,” and that people “are being emotionally manipulated for an agenda.” Instead of engaging, Wilkins suggests that her followers “create peace in your home” and “build strong marriages and families.” (Guichet, through a spokesperson, declined to comment for this story. The other influencers I reached out to, including Gannett and Wilkins, didn’t respond).

You can trace some of this language back to the conservative Christian commentator Allie Beth Stuckey, whose book Toxic Empathy asserts that progressives seek to manipulate Christian compassion in support of an amoral agenda. The former presidential candidate Hillary Clinton zeroed in on Stuckey late last month in an essay in this magazine decrying the “cadre of hard-right ‘Christian influencers’ who are waging a war on empathy.” In response to Clinton, Stuckey wrote a column for The Free Press arguing that women are allowing their emotions to be hijacked, as they were, she argued, during the 2020 protests after George Floyd was killed by a Minneapolis police officer. Empathy “is the bait for pulling Christian women into the Democratic Party,” she wrote. But “if you know a message is meant to manipulate you, it’s not effective.”

Other conservative women with a microphone have echoed this rhetoric, effectively shifting the discussion from Pretti’s killing and immigration enforcement to an attack on the political left. “I believe that words like compassion and empathy and inclusion and love—they’ve been weaponized against us, especially as women,” the conservative activist Riley Gaines said on Fox News last week during a discussion about anti-ICE protests. “Feel first. React loudly. Ask questions later,” Bethany Mandel wrote in the New York Post. “We’ve seen this movie before.”

None of this is necessarily surprising. Political partisans tend to behave in a partisan way—even if that partisanship is disguised as apolitical, Christian living. What is notable is how the followers of these conservative influencers, who are also mostly women, have responded. Part of the point of messages like Guichet’s is to absolve her audience of the need to engage in a subject that makes them uncomfortable. “It’s emboldening people to say, I am not required to speak on this, and that doesn’t make me a bad person,” Wellman, the professor who studies influencers, told me. Guichet’s post, for example, now has 92,000 likes and 3,300 comments—far more engagement than other recent posts on her page. Many women who weighed in have welcomed the message of absolution. “I’m emotionally exhausted from everything happening in my real life,” one wrote. “Can’t be bothered with online anything right now.”

But dozens of other comments expressed dismay and disappointment. “It’s crazy” that these accounts “are all in lock step,” one self-described conservative wrote in a reply to Wilkins’s message about emotional manipulation. “We are supposed to be the free thinkers.” “You helped sway peoples opinions and votes and now you’re deciding it’s no longer your problem,” another commenter wrote to Guichet.

Of course, it’s hard to know how many of these dissenters are followers with genuine concerns—and how many are liberal interlopers. But Guichet responded to some of them anyway. “I am not a news source anymore,” she wrote in one exchange. “God called me out of that season.”

The next few months will likely present many more distressing events on which these influencers will feel pressured to weigh in. How they respond may be determined not by logic or even empathy—but by the particular season in which they find themselves.</div>

            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/books/2026/02/the-real-secret-to-a-filmmakers-success/685934/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Steven Spielberg likes to tell a story that captures the tension between art and commerce in 1970s Hollywood: In January 1973, the young filmmaker George Lucas screened a preview of American Graffiti, his movie about hot rods and ’60s kids. Among the hundreds of raucous fans filling San Francisco’s Northpoint Theatre was the Universal Pictures executive Ned Tanen, who was there to review changes requested by the studio. The audience loved what they saw, but Tanen hated it. “This film is a disaster,” he told Lucas in the theater. “I’m so disappointed in you, George.” Francis Ford Coppola, Lucas’s friend and the film’s producer, exploded at Tanen, telling him he should get down on his knees to thank Lucas. Dramatically reaching into his pocket for his checkbook, Coppola offered to buy out the movie rights then and there.

The anecdote—which Paul Fischer recounts in his excellent new book, The Last Kings of Hollywood—encapsulates the complex relationship between Coppola, Lucas, and Spielberg. There was Coppola’s over-the-top defense of his friend with a grandiloquent gesture (Tanen declined to sell). There was Lucas’s prickly resistance to notes of any kind, which would become his hallmark as he worked to upend the studio system. Spielberg, meanwhile, wasn’t even there; safely above the fray, he could enjoy telling the story without worrying about stray fire. Unlike his restless friends, he would learn to work inside Hollywood rather than seeking to destroy it.

The ’70s were fulcrum years that saw the rise of both the auteur filmmaker and the big blockbuster—sometimes in the same combustible package. At one point in 1976, Coppola was shooting Apocalypse Now while Lucas was filming Star Wars and Spielberg was making Close Encounters of the Third Kind—a remarkable Venn diagram of artistic daring and commercial possibility. Lucas and Spielberg exchanged profit points on their two movies, literally investing in each other’s success. Their peers in the “New Hollywood,” as the era that followed the collapse of the studio system came to be called, were busy creating edgier fare: That same year, Martin Scorsese finished Taxi Driver and Brian De Palma released Carrie. Yet as Fischer shows in The Last Kings of Hollywood, Coppola, Lucas, and Spielberg are worth isolating and studying as a trio. In doing so, he derives a fresh idea from a period that has already been exhaustively studied in books and documentary films. Instead of lauding the triumph of the solo artist or eulogizing the uniqueness of a bygone time, Fischer demonstrates the evergreen value of collaboration.

The three directors—members of a boys’ club in an era rife with them—embodied not just creative drive and box-office magic but also an artistically productive camaraderie. They critiqued one another’s work, inspired their peers to do better, fought bitterly, made up easily, and provided mutual support—both financial and moral. And they set an inspiring example for today’s filmmakers. Hollywood is currently flirting with a return to the studio era, a time when directors were not powerful artists but hired hands: brought on by studios and producers to make sure the actors hit their marks and the productions stayed on schedule. Think of the roster of directors who have shuttled through to handle individual films in the Marvel, Mission Impossible, Harry Potter, and James Bond franchises—not to mention the long list of jobbing TV directors in the age of the big-name showrunner. Fischer provides a counternarrative from a parallel universe: If studios won’t push directors to make great original films, perhaps competition and encouragement from their peers will.

Some of the best filmmakers working today already know this. The “Three Amigos” of Mexican cinema—Alfonso Cuarón, Guillermo del Toro, and Alejandro G. Iñárritu—have been friends for decades, trading brutally honest notes and collaborating on blocking and editing. When Paul Thomas Anderson interviewed Quentin Tarantino in 2019 for a Director’s Guild podcast, Anderson’s admiration for his friend’s movie was palpable. In turn, Tarantino has described Anderson as a “very friendly” combatant, noting, “If I reach high points with Inglourious Basterds, it is partly because Paul came out with There Will Be Blood a couple years ago, and I realized I had to bring up my game.” Yet such relationships are about more than exchanging praise. Tarantino’s recent criticism of Paul Dano’s acting in There Will Be Blood was perhaps ungentlemanly, but it also served as constructive criticism: Casting matters.

This sort of friendly rivalry is especially vital today. Warner Brothers waits to be subsumed by Netflix or Paramount, cinemas are losing customers to streaming, and franchise entertainment continues to dumb us all down. There isn’t much of a structural or commercial imperative to tell bold, original stories. Yet an artistic imperative still feels promising: one-upping your brilliant friends. Such creative competition transcends media and dates back generations. Herman Melville dedicated Moby-Dick to Nathaniel Hawthorne “in token of my admiration for his genius.” Paul McCartney and John Lennon heard the Beach Boys’ Pet Sounds and were inspired to write Sgt. Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band. And Spielberg watched The Godfather and feared he would never make anything as good—before going on to become the most celebrated American filmmaker of his generation.

In describing his central trio’s rise to prominence in the 1970s, Fischer positions Coppola as Lucas’s big-brother figure, and Lucas as Spielberg’s. Partly this tracks with their ages, but it has as much to do with their personalities. Coppola, the head-of-table colossus, was fearless and senseless, a beautiful wreck, as lax with details as he was committed to art. Lucas, in his neat beard and plaid shirts, was shy but certain in his own beliefs, favoring big ideas over execution. Spielberg—youthful, awkward, affable, scarred—was a protean talent who found gold dust in every shot. Coppola gave Lucas his first job, as Coppola’s assistant in the late ’60s. Later, the pair accepted a cold call from Spielberg, who asked if he could come by and talk shop. He was intimidated by Lucas, but Lucas was in awe of Spielberg, who at 22 already had several TV-directing credits.

Much of The Last Kings of Hollywood is devoted to the three near-fiascos that these filmmakers turned into generational hits in the mid-1970s. The shoots for Coppola’s Apocalypse Now, Spielberg’s Jaws, and Lucas’s Star Wars were famously chaotic. Apocalypse stretched on for months in the Philippine jungle, the shark in Jaws didn’t work, and Lucas’s crew couldn’t stand him. The trio busted budgets as well as deadlines but made enduring movies. Fischer skillfully braids the three stories together, situating them in an atmosphere of creative ferment and reckless churn. Each director responded to success in his own way. Coppola and Lucas used their leverage to get out of Hollywood, heading to Northern California to focus on their companies, American Zoetrope and Lucasfilm, respectively. Spielberg stayed put, accepting the constraints of the major studios without diluting his artistic ambitions.

The rifts among these friends—particularly between Lucas and Coppola—could be severe. After American Graffiti became a hit, Lucas proved reluctant to share profits he had contractually agreed on with Coppola. Afterward, the pair fought over projects. Apocalypse Now was originally supposed to be Lucas’s to direct, yet Coppola needed to work after The Godfather: Part II, preferably with an original screenplay rather than another book adaptation. Coppola owned John Milius’s script for Apocalypse, and he told Lucas he might just direct it himself—and “was oblivious to the pain it caused when he took over,” Fischer writes. But there was also collaboration. Although Indiana Jones was Lucas’s idea, Spielberg directed the first four installments of the franchise. The two spitballed the first movie, Raiders of the Lost Ark, while vacationing in Hawaii in 1977. When Paramount tried to condition the deal on finding a different director, “George replied that he was committed to Steven.”

The Last Kings of Hollywood contains few scoops, but the book does offer fresh perspective, particularly with respect to Lucas. Fischer unearthed the contracts for The Empire Strikes Back in the producer Gary Kurtz’s papers, finding that Lucas demanded an astonishing 52.5 percent of the movie’s profits up to $20 million, 72.5 percent up to $100 million, and 77.5 percent above that—in perpetuity. Lucas’s focus on getting paid brings him in for the book’s harshest criticism; Fischer casts him as a rebel turned sellout. “Once a young director who valued a film’s quality and integrity above all,” Fischer writes, “he had slipped into the thinking that he and Francis deplored in film executives.” He made Return of the Jedi as a money play in order to grow his empire, Fischer alleges. “The bottom line had become as much a concern to him as the quality of the film on the screen.” Yet Lucas was trying to break free of Hollywood, and building new infrastructure was expensive. Money meant creative freedom.

Art, like money, occasionally trumped friendship—but sometimes for the better. Coppola’s decision to muscle in on Apocalypse Now almost certainly led to a superior movie. It is hard to imagine a Lucas-directed version: special effects rather than practical ones, wooden dialogue, and lower stakes. Coppola pushed the film into famously gonzo territory, and the film shoot nearly killed him—not to mention his leading man, Martin Sheen. Despite or because of this, the director managed to capture the hallucinatory madness and violent futility of the Vietnam War.

Directors in the ’70s could be harsh in their feedback. When Lucas screened an early cut of Star Wars for a group of filmmakers, Spielberg was supportive, but Brian De Palma gave astringent and ultimately priceless counsel. Feeling lost in the space opera, he suggested an opening text crawl, as in the old Flash Gordon movies, to orient the audience. “The trouble with the Hollywood system is you’re not getting correct feedback,” De Palma told Fischer. “What was good about our group was, we were very honest with each other.” Lucas took the suggestion, and the now-legendary opening to the movie (“A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away”) both situated and transported viewers.

Why did Lucas take the note from De Palma while thumbing his nose at studio suggestions? Because fellow directors usually aim to make movies better, not just more salable. This year, the director Chloé Zhao shared a comment that her close friend Ryan Coogler, the Sinners filmmaker, provided after seeing her latest movie, Hamnet. Coogler told Zhao that it was her first project in which she truly revealed herself. “The other films were beautiful but you hid behind things,” he said. “This is the first time I saw you in there.” It was a lovely compliment, but also an implicit challenge: You’ve taken a step forward. Keep pushing. Coogler was not merely providing input; he was also acknowledging inspiration. An extraordinary film by a peer and competitor had touched him, and perhaps it will elevate his next project.

Fischer’s title—The Last Kings of Hollywood—suggests a long-lost era, nodding to a moment when a handful of directors with visions as big as their egos were allowed to take huge swings. This is probably mostly right—studios’ appetite for risk keeps shrinking, sequels and reboots are favored over original films, and the days of out-of-control productions dancing on the knife-edge of catastrophe may well be behind us. But in recent movies such as Sinners and Anderson’s One Battle After Another, there is evidence that something in the antics of Coppola, Lucas, and Spielberg survives. Perhaps the artistic fraternity of the ’70s  is not a relic, but a model.

If you’ve never seen a laser shoot an aircraft out of the sky, the experience can be unsettling. The weapon fits comfortably into the trunk of a car. It makes no noise and emits no light, not even the glowing red beam that’s so familiar from the movies. When a team of Ukrainian soldiers and engineers took me to see their prototype the other day, it seemed easy to use. Almost too easy.

The operator set up the laser cannon on the roof of his pickup truck in the middle of an empty field. It resembles a hobbyist’s telescope with some cameras affixed to the sides. For target practice, one of the engineers launched a small drone, and it flew a few hundred yards away from us, hovering in the gauzy winter sky. The laser swiveled as its cameras followed the target. The operator shouted, “Fire!” Within seconds, the drone began to burn as if struck by invisible lightning, then fell to the ground in a fiery arc.

The Ukrainian model, known as the Sunray, is not the world’s first laser weapon system. The U.S. Navy has one called Helios, which Lockheed Martin developed as part of a $150 million contract signed in 2018. Four years later, the first Helios laser was installed on a U.S. destroyer to defend against enemy drones. The creators of the Sunray, whose existence has not been previously reported, told me they built their laser in about two years for a few million dollars, and they expect to sell it for a few hundred thousand dollars.

Pavlo Yelizarov, the newly appointed commander of Ukraine’s air-defense forces, sees this price differential as a result of the war with Russia. “Many American companies are driven by money,” he told me last month at his office in Kyiv. “For them, it’s a job. They do it. They get paid. We have another component at play: the need to survive. That’s why we are moving faster.”

In recent months, President Volodymyr Zelensky has prioritized the push to deploy Ukraine’s own air defenses as the United States and Europe have failed to provide enough of them. A lot of U.S. weapons are being diverted to the Middle East, where the U.S. needs them for both a possible strike on Iran and defense against retaliatory strikes from Iranian drones and rockets. The Europeans, for their part, are loath to give Ukraine any more of the weapons they might one day need to guard their own people from Russian drones.

The Ukrainian response has been a race to build a bootstrapped version of the Iron Dome, Israel’s short-range air-defense system, which is thought to be the most effective in the world. (Lockheed Martin is now at work on a comparable system for the United States, which President Trump has dubbed the “Golden Dome.”) But the task of shooting projectiles out of the sky—or, as ballistic-missile defense is often described, “hitting a bullet with a bullet”—has bedeviled engineers at least since the invention of ballistic missiles during World War II. Even in the case of Israel, which has nearly 30 times less territory than Ukraine, the construction of an effective air-defense shield took about four years. A single battery of Iron Dome interceptors cost as much as $100 million in 2012.

Ukraine’s arms manufacturers have tried for several years to get the same results on a far tighter budget, and a handful of them took me to see their inventions last week. These include a 3-D-printed interceptor drone, a carbon-fiber clone of Russia’s best air-defense rocket, wheeled robots armed with chain-gun turrets, and more exotic weapons like the Sunray. Taken together, the trajectory of their development suggests that Ukraine may soon be able to neutralize one of the biggest threats to its security: the swarms of Russian drones that continue to terrorize its civilians and destroy its infrastructure.

“The anti-drone dome is not about the future,” Ukraine’s new defense minister, Mykhailo Fedorov, said last month. “It’s about survival today.”

When Yelizarov was put in charge of building Ukraine’s dome, the appointment received high marks in both political and military circles. But his résumé does not make him an obvious fit for the job. Like Zelensky, he spent much of his career in the TV industry, serving as the lead producer of one of Ukraine’s most popular political talk shows. At the start of the Russian invasion in 2022, he dropped that job and began to develop combat drones with some of his friends, pooling their savings to buy components and assembling them inside Yelizarov’s old TV studio.

Their drones’ initial sorties over the battlefield were promising enough to attract the attention of the U.S. government, which sent truckloads of equipment and C-4 explosives to help Yelizarov develop his fleet. The spearfishing enthusiast soon took on a nom de guerre: Lazar, in honor of the biblical Lazarus, and he founded a drone unit known as Lasar’s Group, now part of the Ukrainian National Guard. According to official estimates, drone strikes conducted by Lasar’s Group have destroyed more than $13 billion in Russian military equipment, a kill rate that got Yelizarov promoted in 2023 to the rank of colonel.

Last year, as U.S.-mediated peace talks raised the prospect of a cease-fire, a lot of drone makers in Ukraine began looking for ways to sell their products to foreign clients, and Yelizarov encouraged them. “While the market is hot,” he said, “we want foreign companies to buy stakes in Ukrainian ones and start developing products together.” Such joint ventures could allow Ukraine to produce more of its weapons elsewhere in Europe, ensuring stability of supply if factories inside Ukraine get bombed.

A few months ago, a barrage of Russian drones destroyed the main facility that produces drones for Lasar’s Group, incinerating about $35 million in equipment, Yelizarov said, including a large stockpile of weapons. (The target and damage from the attack have not been previously revealed.) Similar strikes laid waste throughout the winter to the Ukrainian power grid and heating system as temperatures dropped far below freezing.

Still, when he got the offer last month to lead the defense against such attacks, Yelizarov’s first instinct was to turn it down. The timeline seemed unrealistic. Zelensky wanted the new air-defense shield to be up and running by summer. Yelizarov said that Fedorov, the new defense minister, appealed to his pride: “He told me: ‘Look, we can spend a long time watching the football game and criticizing the players on the field. But I’m offering you a chance to get in the game and show what you can do.’”

That task has been daunting, and Yelizarov already looked worse for wear when we met during his second week on the job. He had just returned that day from a meeting with Zelensky, who grilled the new commander about the intricacies of “sky protection.” In his new role as the deputy head of the Ukrainian Air Force, Yelizarov will need to assess the variety of air-defense systems coming out of the domestic weapons industry, organize the best ones under a unified command, and develop ways to choose the most appropriate one to shoot down an incoming threat.

The key to success, he said, would be efficiency. Too often, Ukraine has been forced to launch scarce and expensive foreign missiles to shoot down cheap Russian drones such as the Shaheds, some of which run on lawnmower engines. “Sure, you can use a Bentley to haul potatoes,” Yelizarov said. “But it’s probably not the smartest way to do that job.”

One solution to the problem of efficiency has emerged from a company called Skyfall. It was founded in 2022, during the early months of the invasion, by a young electrical engineer who prefers not to publicize his name for security reasons. His most popular invention is a bomber drone called the Vampire, which proved to be such a menace on the battlefield that the Russians nicknamed it Baba Yaga—“the Wicked Witch.”

In December, during Russian President Vladimir Putin’s annual call-in show, a war reporter for the Kremlin’s main propaganda channel asked why the military had failed to develop its own version of this weapon after nearly four years of war. “We are completely lacking large hexacopters like the Baba Yaga, which the Ukrainian armed forces actively use,” the reporter said. Putin, scribbling on a notepad, admitted to the “shortage” of such technology, and promised that his defense ministry is working on it.

For the team at Skyfall, the exchange served as a vindication, demonstrating Ukraine’s ability to out-engineer the Russians in one of the most crucial weapons in this war. Last spring, when I first toured Skyfall’s factory in Kyiv, its engineers were working on ways to shoot down Shaheds, but its drones could not yet go fast enough to catch them mid-flight. By the time I visited again last week, Skyfall had developed a much faster interceptor, tested it, and put it into mass production. “The problem with supply is solved,” the founder told me during the tour. “We can make as many as the military needs.”

Officially known as P1-Sun, the weapon resembles a large thermos, and has four rotors and about 500 grams of C-4 at its base. The phallic design led its developers, mostly young geeks and gamers, to nickname it Pisun, which means “dick” in Ukrainian. (Some of Skyfall’s competitors refer to it with a note of jealousy as “the dildo drone.”)

Inside the factory, the smell of molten plastic hit me in the face as we entered “the farm,” where row upon row of 3-D printers churned out hundreds of fuselages for the P1-Sun. The drones have already been used to blast more than 1,000 targets out of the sky, including more than 700 Shaheds, according to the company’s estimates. By the end of this year, advances in the P1-Sun’s communication software will allow the Ukrainian armed forces to position the units around the country, ready to launch from a distance whenever radar detects an incoming fleet of attack drones overhead.

The weapons have attracted plenty of interest from foreign clients, and Skyfall recently presented it at arms fairs in Riyadh and Abu Dhabi. “The drone industry in Ukraine today is the biggest industry for investors,” Zelensky told students on Friday at the Kyiv Aviation Institute. This year, he said, Ukraine will open 10 “export centers” in Germany, the Baltic states, and other parts of Europe, expanding the market to many of the approximately 450 companies that produce drones in Ukraine today.

None of them has yet made any real technological breakthroughs. But they have learned to mass-produce weapons of brutal efficiency with the cheapest techniques and components available. For some of the players in this business, the advances have felt dangerously fast. “We have opened a Pandora’s box that terrifies me,” the founder of Skyfall said. The P1-Sun costs a little more than $1,000 and can reach heights of more than 30,000 feet. “Imagine if it hangs up there in the path of a civilian airliner,” the founder said. “Nobody would even know who did it.”

As the war enters its fifth year, Ukraine sees no alternative to unleashing these weapons into the world. Its reliance on Western hardware has left Ukrainians unprotected. Among the main priorities for the new air-defense system will be to secure troops and supply lines in the war zone, and to defend people living closest to the front. In the southern cities of Kherson and Nikopol, for instance, Russian drone units have begun to use pedestrians for target practice, hunting them on the streets in what Ukrainians call a “human safari.”

Read: Ukraine’s latest attacks showcase its desperation

Both cities sit directly on the front line, across the Dnipro River from large formations of Russian troops. During my most recent visit to the area, in 2024, the then-mayor of Nikopol, Yevhen Yevtushenko, told me that its residents usually run errands on rainy days, because enemy drones tend to hunt in fair weather. “Our best means of shooting them down is with these missiles we’ve been getting from abroad,” Yevtushenko said, citing the German launcher known as the IRIS-T. “That’s a problem, because nobody is going to use those expensive rockets to shoot down a little drone.”

The dilemma seemed insurmountable at the time. But Ukrainian technology has caught up faster than either of us had expected. None of the weapons would be capable of shooting down Russia’s advanced ballistic missiles, which only the U.S.-made Patriot batteries have proved capable of reliably defeating. But when it comes to the cruder drones and rockets that Russia flings at Ukrainian cities every day, the many tinkerers of Ukraine seem much closer to a solution than they were just a year ago. “It can be done, and it needs to be done,” Yelizarov said at the end of our interview. “Because we don’t have any other choice.”

The night after he took up his new job, the Russians launched another wave of drones and cruise missiles at Ukraine’s civilian infrastructure, cutting off power and heat in the capital during one of the winter’s coldest nights. The following morning, Yelizarov saw a post on social media demanding to know why the new head of air defenses had not stopped the barrage. “I’d been on the job for less than a day, and already I was being called a failure,” he said with a smile. “I understand. People want results now. They want them yesterday.”</div>

I would presume a subpoena would require such retrieval. I can imagine a few cryptographic systems to make that difficult by mixing it with production but that would require extraordinary effort and commitment to privacy, which I would never expect of pretty much any corporation.

Don&#39;t get me wrong, this is a good move, but let&#39;s be careful to not get too cavalier assuming compromising info has been deleted.

It&#39;s a shame but I&#39;m mentally and strategically  preparing for services to require ID one by one over the next decade and ending my 1988-present use of the Internet at that point.

Give Google all of my data, so they can &#39;remove&#39; it for me.

Give Palantir my photo, so they can remove it for me.

That is what a properly functioning government is for :-[

Who would have thought that when you have a government hell bent on turning the US into 1930s Nazi Germany, complete with a law enforcement body (ICE) acting like Hitler&#39;s Brown Shirts did, disappearing immigrants both legal and illegal and shooting it&#39;s own US born citizens at point blank range that anyone who can leave is and people who would&#39;ve emigrated to the US are looking elsewhere?Quoted against the censor trolls, though mostly they seem to like &quot;Redundant&quot; moderation abuse. Maybe redundant is not applicable for FP?On the actual story, my slight curiosity is about the balance. I don&#39;t think the YOB has actually deported that many people in absolute terms.

Jews in 1930s/1940s Germany wish they had only to deal with ICE.

Hey genius, President Obama deported more than Trump has. But don&#39;t let facts get in the way of your TDS meltdown.And somehow he managed to achieve that without all the drama.

And somehow he managed to achieve that without all the drama.

Do think that has something to do with not having an opposition party doing everything they can to manufacture drama about it?

Remember ICE was created by the Home Land Security act which was a NEOCON invention post 9/11. Most of the GOP leadership who supported that were still holding legislative office, still influential party members.  It would have been inconvenient to attack Obama on immigration (enforcement anyway, as opposed to things like DACA), to say the least. Not that they would have wanted to be

There are always special interest groups who are highly concerned about various government policies and actions. That&#39;s normal.

The drama I&#39;m talking about here is dragging the entire country to the verge of a civil war, all while failing even to match Obama&#39;s performance on this key MAGA goal.

No, the press did cover it. I remember it distinctly, including complaints from the left wing of the Democratic party.

The difference was that the Obama administration did it in an orderly manner and followed due process rather than sending a bunch of masked clowns into a city he didn&#39;t like and start rounding up anybody with an accent. There was no media circus because ICE was behaving like normal police and wasn&#39;t killing people in the process.

This was also the time when Republicans were pretending that they would agree to comprehensive immigration reform if given sufficient border security. You had politicians like Ted Cruz sign onto bills that had a path to citizenship for the undocumented. The thought was that if we could aggressively deport the actual criminal migrants, then maybe we could get agreement to let others stay. The problem was that calls for &quot;border security&quot; before compressive reform were never in good faith. Despite their insistence otherwise, it&#39;s clear under the Trump administration that Republicans never supported &quot;legal immigration&quot; or any immigration at all (well, unless the immigrants have $5 million to drop on a &quot;gold card&quot;).

Yeah, I must have totally forgotten about the time Obama sent masked agents to go door-to-door looking for anybody with an accent.

Here&#39;s the key difference: Obama&#39;s policies were bad if you were an immigrant or an immigrant friend/family member. Trump&#39;s policies impact everyone in their path because they effectively suspend the 4th amendment for everyone regardless of citizenship (not to mention the thread of summary execution for exercising the 2nd and arrest for exercising the 1st).

Yeah, I must have totally forgotten about the time Obama sent masked agents to go door-to-door looking for anybody with an accent.ICE has always been kinda like this.  Trump has certainly worsened it and let them off their leash, because he&#39;s interested in using them to punish the people in places he doesn&#39;t like. But you can find reporting on them brutalizing detainees and kids in cages and outdoor detention centers going back at least 15 years if not more.Here&#39;s the key difference: Obama&#39;s policies were bad if you were an immigrant or an immigrant friend/family member.

Obama sucked on this issue, and Trump sucks worse, but there is no point in defending the former.

No, nobody is saying it was ever &quot;fine.&quot; Nobody is saying that ICE was never problematic or abusive. It&#39;s just that those abuses were much more localized and targeted. There is a material difference between what is happening now and what happened 15 years ago. It&#39;s not unreasonable that the current behavior of ICE is causing a far greater uproar than in the past. and it&#39;s not some sort of unthinking reflexive reaction to the &quot;Orange man.&quot;

ICE gotten to the point that it&#39;s much bigger than immigration or the border. What ICE has become means that all constitutional protections are suspect. What is the 4th amendment good for in ANY context if the government can just claim it broke down your door to look for an immigrant? What good is the 2nd amendment if concealed carry means a federal officer can just shoot you and claim immunity if you are carrying a firearm? What good is the 1st amendment if reporting on a protest can get you arrested?

The press covered it. I read several articles on it at the time so I cannot be gaslit by your clown ass.

However, we can already tell that you&#39;re just playing bullshit performative games here by pretending that Obama&#39;s enforcement was not different in that it was not simply a cover for implementing fascism, so no matter what you are not going to impress anyone here.

I hear you saying that because Fox News, Breitbart, and Rush Limbaugh didn&#39;t cover Obama&#39;s immigration enforcement actions, that means &quot;the press&quot; didn&#39;t cover this topic.

Were 5 year olds sent to detention centers? https://www.theguardian.com/us... [theguardian.com]

How about American citizens shot dead in the street?

The Obama administration&#39;s massive expansion of family detention began in the summer of 2014 and will incarcerate thousands of asylum-seeking children and mothers who are fleeing extreme violence in the Northern Triangle region of Central America (Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador) this year.Immigrants&#39; rights groups and others were furious with Obama, whose DoJ fought tooth and nail to keep the family detention centers open until a federal judge finally called them &quot;inhumane&quot; and ordered (some of) them closed.

Yes, people did give a shit when Democrats were in office, and in fact protested about it. However, one HUGE difference is that the Obama administration had no policy of family separation. 5-year-olds were not rounded up alone or used as bait for their parents. Family detention was used when families came as groups to the border- the Obama administration wasn&#39;t snatching kids off the streets of American cities.

Were CITIZENS being assaulted by immigration while Obama was in office?   How about citizens being assaulted by ICE?   You fail to understand the backlash against what is going on, where the US Constitution is being ignored.   EVERYONE has protection against illegal search and seizure in this country, that means citizens, legal residents, and even illegal residents of this country.   If they have an actual warrant, then that is one thing, but ICE doesn&#39;t get a warrant, they break into the homes of citizens

Were CITIZENS being assaulted by immigration while Obama was in office?Yes. Even I had run-ins with CBP & ICE. Fuck off.

And one common thread - being denied medical care. And she is not the only one, there are many reports of this.

[npr.org] Were they running around with masks and unmarked rental vans under the previous administration?

ICE and CPB have always sucked, and have always been terrible.

But your shtick about how this makes the current regime the same is just fucking stupid. This is a massive escalation of awfulness on every front.

Some examples:- Sending people to be tortured in El Salvador.- Openly defying almost 100 court orders.- Arresting people who are here legally at their hearings.- Shooting US citizens in the back, and then instantly halting any investigation into the incident.- Raiding churches and schools.- Claiming tha

Most of the people being arrested are here legally.

And they are still people. Your celebration of what is happening to them is assholeish, to the point of sociopathy.

I am planning to ignore anything else you post here. You are not worth any more of my time.

The only way for democrats to win this is to get out ahead of it, promise to keep deporting people but in a humane way, and then actually carry through on it. I don&#39;t personally believe they&#39;re capable, but I pray that they are. Otherwise it&#39;s going to be more of this every 4 years.I&#39;m with you on most of your post but that sounds like what the Democrats were already doing and that wasn&#39;t solving the problem.What we need is proper reform of our immigration laws, especially on the employer end. Illegal immigrants come here for work, if there&#39;s no one willing or able to hire them then their numbers will be radically reduced to levels where the problem won&#39;t really matter.

What we need is to stop doing coups in Latin America. How come nobody ever wants to address the root cause?

That is part of another root cause. There are two ends to this problem, Latin American poverty and instability and American employers. On one side you have people who need jobs and on the other you have people offering them. Eliminate one of the problems and no one has a reason to come here anymore so the problem mostly solves itself. Unfortunately the US not screwing over Latin America alone won&#39;t solve their third world problems where as addressing the problem on the American employer end seems quite appr

Hey genius, President Obama also accomplished this without sending masked goons into our cities to harass ethnic minorities which is what the above is talking about.

Obama didn&#39;t have immigration shooting citizens with ZERO accountability.   When citizens and legal residents of this country need to be afraid of being killed or even just assaulted by the thugs people like you love so much, that&#39;s a VERY large problem, along with the violations of the US Constitution, which has protections against unlawful search and seizure.   Now, &quot;It&#39;s ICE, if you tell them they can&#39;t come in and search your home, you suggest that it&#39;s our fault when ICE blasts chemical weapons in our

Obama somehow managed to deport more people than Trump without turning cities into warzones and murdering citizens.  I guess it&#39;s just one more thing that Obama was better at than Trump.

It&#39;s almost as if the deportations aren&#39;t the problem.  Maybe one day you&#39;ll figure this out.

OP is referring to them as brown shirts because they&#39;re being used for intimidation, amassing in blue cities like Minneapolis instead of red states that actually need  and want immigration enforcement. They also break laws, violate the constitution and kill people, then lie afterward to cover it up.

The issue for most people isn&#39;t immigration enforcement, but how it&#39;s being done.

The brown shirts were at least man enough to show their faces. I guarantee all these masked gang members were screaming about not being able to breathe when Target asked them to wear a mask while shopping.

That&#39;s more likely due to the fact that there was no Internet to quickly spread their actions, so the government could control the narratives much more easily to all but the most localized populations.

to quote you that&#39;s &quot;bullshit, bullshit & more bullshit&quot;.ICE is specifically acting like thugs in Blue cities because that&#39;s what Trump, Miller, etc want, to provoke a violent reaction as a pretext to invoke the Insurrection Act and to normalize using government thugs for enforcement and intimidation which they&#39;ll ramp up for the midterms to &quot;true to vote&quot;

Texas has had the most ICE arrests under many presidents because its an easy place for immigrants to both cross the border and surrender, and many border crossers just dont go further. The high statistic is just border apprehensions. There arent masked ICE agents in Texas urban areas en mass running cars off the road, teargassing, beating, and murdering people. The comparison is bullshit.

Comically Trumps goons accused Minnesota law enforcement of not cooperating with ICE detainers and the local law enforcem

Because that makes the game rather obvious, does it not? Submit and help throw the election or the pain continues.

Sorry dude, you are so full of shit simple googling refutes you and your fucked up projection about what you think happened.

Many of us are making sure there is ample documentation of this period. The Good Germans of this period are not going to be able to slink away.

Israel isn&#39;t literally Nazi, but they are marching to an effectively identical tune, yes. They are doing a genocide and we are paying for it. In fact it&#39;s why we founded their country for them in the first place.

The planet is overpopulated. The US is more overpopulated than most regions.?Not sure why you think this. At 37 people per square kilometer, the US is not &quot;more overpopulated than most regions&quot;.  Even if you don&#39;t count Alaska, the US population density is only 44 people per square kilometer, which would place it 176th out of 245 in the list of countries by population density.Pretty low compared to actually overpopulated countries, or even, say, most of Europe-- for example, the UK has 285 people per square km, or Germany with 242 people per square km.

Meanwhile we were already looking at major problems supporting Social Security even with our old immigrant driven growth.

This should have been the expected result of our current immigration policies though as indiscriminately targeting ethnic minorities with government harassment is obviously going to discourage legal immigrants as well as the illegal ones.

If the income level was raised at which Social Security was taxed, this wouldn&#39;t be an issue.  Currently, the first $176,000 is taxed. Raise that to $300,000 and Social Security would be fine.

Make it even higher than that- or remove the cap all together. What&#39;s the big idea giving those who don&#39;t need it a pass anyway? Something is going to have to change.

SS is the carrot that keeps us all quietly working. You want to start a revolution? End SS.

So the logic that I&#39;ve heard by someone who sounded reasonably intelligent (ie: not MAGA) is that Social Security has a hard limit on the payout side.  To offset the fact that there is a payout limit, they also limit the amount of income that is brought into it.  Reasonable people can argue if that should have been the case or not, but it&#39;s a decent justification of the income limit.

Remember SS was never designed to be another tax.  It was meant to be a taxpayer funded safety net with very strictly defined

My understanding is that was the original intent, but congress stole all the money and turned Social Security into a Ponzi scheme.

That&#39;s a fantastic idea except we&#39;ve known about this looming problem for a couple decades now and have not implemented it.

No it wouldn&#39;t.  Anyone taxed at the higher cap would be eligible for increased social security payments in the future.  You&#39;re still robbing Peter to pay Paul.

The wealthy are stealing peoples&#39; wages and rigging the system while their PR people have you worshiping them like a sucker in a cult. Robbery has become the norm and it is going to the rich more than when we had a king doing it...who even had a religion created to justify it!  I used to think communists were the most gullible...

Immigrants have to pay into social security like everyone else.

In fact a lot of undocumented people pay taxes (usually using someone else&#39;s SSN, which has happened to me personally) and they pay into social security but won&#39;t be able to collect any. It will be HARDER to fund it without them.

Maybe try learning how any of this works before blathering

Maybe try reading carefully before posting as you don&#39;t seem to be addressing what I&#39;m saying at all.

This is why it&#39;s time to end social security.The result will be a steep rise in petty crime, and you will have to pay more taxes to fight the crime, or even for a private security company to keep you safe. And with the rise of petty crime, there will come the rise of crime lords, which organize the petty crime and fight over turf, and you will get a new mob. And it will be 1925 all over again.

&quot;Driving away all (both legal and illegal) immigration is doing a hell of a lot more damage to Social Security than paying illegal immigrants ever did.&quot;

This is so obvious that it seems to need no explanation, yet the entire science of economics is based on the fantasy of endless growthWe need steady-state sustainabilityThere is a chance that population decline along with increased use of automation might balance out

Zero growth, so the unemployed stay unemployed, and while we have inflation, we end up falling behind.

As with all &quot;westernized&quot; countries that are looking at population cliffs. Hopefully policies can be enacted that promote people having more or even at least one child.

Right now things are far too overpriced, with a lot of uncertainly. With the proper policies and support that could be changed.

But this isn&#39;t just a US problem. Most of Europe, and the &quot;westernized&quot; Asian countries like Japan and Korea are also experiencing this exact same problem.

But when you have young people coming out of college with hundreds of thousands in debt who aren&#39;t finding jobs or housing. They generally hold off on starting families. And those that do will limit their size to be smaller than they&#39;d like without economic constraints.

It&#39;s not just &quot;Westernized&quot; countries, whatever that means.  Birth rates are down everywhere, even in countries with traditionally high birth rates.

Examples: Kenya had 7.65 live births per woman in 1960 and is now at 3.26.  India went from 5.92 to 1.99.  Lebanon 5.88 to 2.26.  Saudi Arabia 7.63 to 2.28.

There are no incentives in the world that can meaningfully change those numbers.  We just have to adapt to a new reality.

Actually, those &quot;third-world shitholes&quot; use much less energy and fewer resources than wealthy countries.  So it&#39;s wealthy countries that should be reducing either their consumption or their population.

For the MAGA dimwits, getting rid of negative value non-white people results in an effective population increase.

My guess is that we&#39;re entering the final stage of Universe 25.

Bingo. Financial strain, delaying starting families for a career, and abortion are the real factors we have a declining population. Two of those three are really uncomfortable for many to confront though, so it&#39;s easier to point the finger elsewhere.

Abortion, really? Just how many do you think women are having?

You cant rely on illegal immigration to prop up falling birth rates. That&#39;s absurd. If we&#39;re concerned with why we have a population decline, we should be looking at falling birth rates, not importing bodies.

According to this website:  https://www.theglobalstatistic... [theglobalstatistics.com]

In Fiscal year 2024, Biden did 271,484 deportations.In Fiscal year 2025, Trump did 207,000 deportations.

This only refers to full legal deportations - people sent to Immigration court and ordered out of the country by an special Inquire Officer (a direct employee of the DOJ that works as a &#39;judge&#39;).  It does not include people that after being sent to an immigration holding facility agree to leave the country without contesting it.

No, they&#39;ll still get care-  they&#39;ll just pay for it with the fortune that only an entire lifetime of easy economic opportunity brings. They spent their whole lives building the very system that&#39;s going to suck them dry. There might have been some help to take some of the pressure of, but as a voting bloc, they reliably voted against it every chance they had.

End of life care is now basically built specifically to extract all of the wealth from the boomer generation. When they&#39;re gone things are going to drastically change because the math wont work-  the rest of us don&#39;t have even close to the resources they&#39;ve managed to accrue.

It&#39;s not just end of life care. Half of all healthcare dollars go to treating chronic conditions. If funding is reduced due to demographic problems, it&#39;s going to affect healthcare for people of all ages.

quick lets flood the country with low IQ third worlders!Have you looked at the current cabinet?

quick lets flood the country with low IQ third worlders!

That certainly is a reversal.  Usually they vote Democrat:

Nothing will be &quot;bricked&quot;. You would simply have to reinstall the OS.

for a very large number of Windows users that&#39;s a distinction without a difference

You don&#39;t have to do anything. The certificate used to sign the boot process is expiring. That doesn&#39;t make your computer unbootable, it means you can&#39;t sign new boot certificates or update the revocation database. Actually reinstalling the OS may be a problem, but using your computer as normal is not.

It does not. Secure boot is entirely within the users control. At the most it may cause a boot failure and a quick google will direct any idiot to a solution.

To add to this, this certificate expiry issue will not cause computers to fail to boot. It will cause the inability to sign a new or changed boot process... something which only happens if the bootloader is changed by an OS update. Not only is nothing bricked, the end user is unlikely to notice anything changed.

They love forcing customers do whatever microsoft wants because that&#39;s how they get off. This would have been a great way to force hardware upgrades at gunpoint. So it really makes you wonder, what&#39;s their real motive here.

I can see how Microsoft would prefer to make computers less safe. It&#39;s in their DNA.

The goal of &quot;Secure Boot&quot; is to ensure that Microsoft control your PC, not you. It&#39;s working as intended.

Secure boot is functionally useless if you&#39;re not using custom keysThat&#39;s a load of shit. Key signing practices have varying benefits. It&#39;s not binary. It&#39;s not secure vs not. Based on your own description precisely nothing on the internet is secure because certificates are signed by not you.Yes signing your own key would be the most secure, but in practice it is only marginally more secure than trusting a third party (such as a third party that already has low level access to your system via pushed updates) to keep their keys under control.

Let&#39;s be fair... They don&#39;t go to a landfill, they get shipped to India to be burned.

Bro, disabling write means disabling security patches and updates. Not very secure, is it?

This is how industrial PLCs handle it: with a physical key. Almost any time you hear about some &quot;hack&quot; of a PLC, the fine print says someone must leave the key turned to program.

Yes it&#39;s always an option. There&#39;s rarely a reason to enable it unless your workplace forces it on.

You got that completely backwards. There&#39;s no reason to disable it unless you&#39;re running an unsigned boot process (e.g. dual booting with Linux without bothering to setup secure boot, or regularly trying to boot systems from USB sticks). There&#39;s literally no downside to the end user and only increased security.

Indeed. It is basically worthless for security, all it does is cause problems.

Is that not an option on most hardware?It is a *required* option of any BIOS on a device sold with Windows Hardware Certification (on x86). Microsoft does not enforce it for ARM devices. Even Microsoft first party devices like Surface Laptops allow you to disable secure boot.

I have MS own laptop, which was gifted to me, and it allows me to disable secure boot in BIOS settings. It gives me angry red banner with unlocked lock, but other than that it does not prevent booting. Is that not an option on most hardware?Disabling secure boot is an option on most hardware, however, there are some applications/features that will not fully operate if secure boot is not enabled, and that includes some multi-player games.

You also don&#39;t need to disable secure boot. The certificates are used to sign the bootloader. The system will continue to boot just fine, it just may have problems if something changes on the bootload, ... which won&#39;t happen because you aren&#39;t getting updates. And if you are getting updates one will give you a new certificate.

This is a nothing burger for the end user, other than their systems will have secure boot sitting in a somewhat compromised state.

Strictly speaking TPM hardware is not required for Windows 11 to install or operate, and secure boot isn&#39;t either. You just have to bypass/ignore all the warnings.

All this leaves you without secure boot as an added bonus, so no downsides.

The one place I have it on is on my teaching laptop, because I have exams and grades on there and hence BitLocker. But if BigBlueButton works (trying this semester), I can get off Teams and move that machine to Linux. I finally eliminated PowerPoint end of last year (LibreOffice and LaTeX for slides now).

Windows 10 users must enroll in Microsoft&#39;s paid Extended Security Updates program to get the new certificates.

Microsoft should be required to provide a certificate without any restriction. How many tens of millions of computers still run W10?  Forcing people to enroll in something just to get a required update should be an automatic penalty.

It&#39;s a bit of a moot point. Systems that aren&#39;t receiving general OS updates wouldn&#39;t receive updated bootloaders anyhow. So they wouldn&#39;t need the updated certificates that allow for bootloaders signed after June 2026.

It gets a bit tautological, but only systems that are getting updates need updates.

I think that your completely correct point is lost on most people. They don&#39;t realize that a signature is valid if the certificate was valid at the time of signing, not that the certificate must be valid for the life of the universe.

No one is forced to enrol in anything. Windows 10 is no longer secure. Simply disable secure boot in the BIOS and move on with your life. You&#39;re not getting anything running secure boot on a system which isn&#39;t receiving basic security updates anymore.

Actually I was wrong in my other post. Not only are you not forced to enrol in anything, you also don&#39;t need to disable secure boot. Nothing changes for the end user. Either you get updates, which updates the certs. Or you don&#39;t get updates, in which case there&#39;s nothing that would change the bootloader (which remains signed and bootable).

Secure boot is optional for all people affected and their systems will continue to boot just fine even with it on.

At least, they do NOW. Let&#39;s see if Microsoft breaks things for Linux as part of this update...

LInux (if your distro has fwupd installed and enabled to offer the update) has been offering to install some of the new certs for a while now.

At least one distro has had a test day to validate that it is possible to sign their boot loader with various combinations of the old/new keys.  I expect additional testing across the Linux distro eco-system (as some hardware is just so interesting).

I have about 70 machines (Dell) I&#39;ll need to take care of. AlmaLinux supports fwupd, but for whatever reason (at least on my test box) fwupdmgr keeps telling me there&#39;s no available firmware, which is demonstrably incorrect. We do have a password set on the firmware, so I&#39;ve been assuming that is the issue and I&#39;m gonna need to visit every machine with a USB stick.

That reminds me that I need to check the security system on my henhouse which ensures that _only_ foxes, and no other predator has 24h access.

Or is it only CA certificates that can only be loaded directly from Microosft.com?

All it does is cause problems. DRM, not &quot;security&quot;...

Bitcoin is the opposite of untraceable. There&#39;s literally a public journal of every transaction. If you can be connected to a wallet then every transaction you&#39;ve conducted is exposed.

0.000000294 Bitcoin has been added to your account (And now I have your wallet address).

it is entirely traceable and at least in the US and UK and it consider theft if you knowingly keep a deposit paid to you in error. My &#39;guess&#39; would that courts would consider that applies to crypto currency ledgers as well.

Now when this crypto stuff was new I suspect prosecutors would have said &#39;wtf is a bitcoin, I am to busy for this computer nerd nonsense&#39; and let you skate, but we not there anymore.

Sure maybe this no financial institution that can undo your transaction but property law broadly exists outside of banking and finance, and the notion that if someone over pays you a few million dollars worth of bitcoin and your going to say &#39;sorry Charlie, mine now&#39; is just plain stupid. Some guy in a black robe is going to say return the money and I am going to jail you for contempt if you don&#39;t until you do&#39;  at least if you are ripping off any of the sorts of people governments tend to protect. If you are ripping off the other sorts of people with millions worth of bitcoin to over pay you in the first place well better look over your shoulder...

take that bitcoin and let the courts work it out will the rules of bitcoin in the court room

How would you react if the bank would take $120 millions from your account to your detriment... by mistake?

Also, I would be cautious about &quot;untraceable&quot;. I would say &quot;hard to trace for someone who is not  determined to look it up&quot;.

The safer approach would simply be to say, &quot;You want that coin back? We gonna fight about it in court. Unless you figure out how to make this go away&quot;. Because theres a good chance a judge would say &quot;This guy didnt do a fraud, you gave him those coins all by yourself&quot;. He might also say you have to give it back. Lawyers hate that sort of uncertainty, so its highly likely a settlement would be on the table.

That&#39;s correct. Bitcoin transactions are too slow and expensive, so exchanges don&#39;t actually execute them all or truly move them among wallets. They just keep track of where the various amounts belongs and can move it as needed within their own system, then pay it out when requested. Much like your bank doesn&#39;t physically move a pile of money from one account to another, they simply change their ledger as of where to move it.

So in other words, they&#39;re lying to you, telling you that you&#39;re invested in Bitcoin, when actually they just gave you an account that is &quot;supposed to be&quot; backed by Bitcoin.

Well, if all of the business is transacted in Bitcoin, then there isn&#39;t much tying a person to an address.

The problem is when people want to convert Bitcoin to anything else. Money changers often like to know who they are dealing with :)

Again, wasn&#39;t the point of bitcoin that you didn&#39;t need to trust some other jerk to store your assets?

Not quite. In these Bitcoin exchanges, you don&#39;t really truly control your wallet. The exchange does. They have full access and control of your wallet. This allows them to automate transfers. In reality, you don&#39;t actually possess the bitcoin, they do. So they can simply reverse the transaction.

Much like your money in your bank isn&#39;t truly in your control, it&#39;s under the banks control. They can move things around on their ledger and if they make a mistake they can reverse it.

No they didn&#39;t lie. Transactions on the ledger are permanent and not reversable. The thing is, it takes anywhere between 10-60 minutes for a confirmation of a ledger entry, and most financial entities require multiple confirmations before recognising the transaction as legitimate, so it could take several hours before a transaction is considered immutable.

So unless you like your pizza really really cold and starting to go stale, someone (usually an exchange) will act as an escrow for the transaction.

South Korean lawmakers have raised concern over the so-called âoephantom coinâ issue: How Bithumb was able to distribute 620,000 bitcoins when its own stockpile appeared to have numbered closer to 50,000.Wait, how does the blockchain even allow you to spend what you don&#39;t have?

Wait, how does the blockchain even allow you to spend what you don&#39;t have?Ask the Federal Reserve.

The Federal Reserve understands how BC&#39;s blockchain works???  Who knew?

As for &quot;printing money&quot;/spending what you don&#39;t have, yes, I&#39;m familiar with how that works in fiat currencies.  I just didn&#39;t think it was possible with BitCoin.

But Bithumb is still trying to convince users who during the brief window of trading managed to offload more than 100 bitcoins, valued at roughly $9 million, to give back the equivalent funds.What&#39;s that saying again? &quot;Code is Law&quot;?Those 100 bitcoins are gone. Tough shit to those guys.

Those 100 bitcoins are gone. Tough shit to those guys.

Why? If any coins moved at all (bold assumption) it was no doubt into accounts controlled by the owners. &quot;Oops we accidentally gave away $40 billion, that totally happened and we&#39;re not crypto scammers trying to promote ourselves!&quot;

If a bank deposits money into your account by accident, and you spend that money, you are liable for returning it.  It&#39;s settled law.  You can&#39;t claim you didn&#39;t know or thought it was a &quot;gift&quot; from the bank.

If these people choose not to return the money then the next step would be to freeze their wallets/accounts.

What is bingo? The complete lack of understanding of laws? The law isn&#39;t about banks, it&#39;s about transactions. Being a bank or not is irrelevant.

Irrelevant. &quot;Bank&quot; in this case is just a party to the transaction. You&#39;re not entitled to keep anything that was obviously sent to you in error, even if it&#39;s a private transaction between individuals.

On top of that, quickly turning around the transaction to try and prevent the money getting clawed back is usually considered by the courts to be direct evidence that a party knew the transaction was in error.

It&#39;s like if you go to an ATM and get out $5 and it spits out a $50. You often get to keep it. If you

You&#39;re not entitled to keep anything that was obviously sent to you in errorThis is obviously false. You get to keep many things obviously sent to you in error.

You&#39;re not entitled to keep anything that was obviously sent to you in error

This is obviously false. You get to keep many things obviously sent to you in error.

Actually the law is law, and the code is code, and the code of bitcoin is not anonymous (quite the opposite). The law says the people who tried to make the 100 bitcoins disappear are in trouble if someone investigates them and follows up on this.

Enough recipients sought to sell or withdraw bitcoin

More than one winner?  Or not winners, just exchange clients?  Did one winner start disbursing to his friends?

The global market sank?  Because of 10 lost Bitcoin?  Was there a rumor that went viral?  Was it the exchange&#39;s local bid/ask table?

BTC txns?  Their database of custodial accounts?

Those affected included investors who had held bitcoin

Promotional campaign, yeah I&#39;m sure. I&#39;m sure they had 40 billion worth of bitcoin lying around and managed to transfer it to actual other bitcoin accounts without anyone noticing.

They didn&#39;t accidentally give away $40 billion. They accidentally gave away the equivalent of a little less than $10 million. $40 billion was just the theoretical value attached to their fat finger error had they actually given away the number of bitcoin instead of the Korean won they intended.

President Donald Trump’s mass deportation campaign seemed to hit a horrifying crescendo in the last month, with chaos in the streets of Minneapolis stretching the city’s populace to a near-breaking point. Unfortunately, the situation is about to get worse. On Friday, two far-right judges greenlit the Trump administration’s radical reinterpretation of federal law that would sweep millions more immigrants into mandatory detention, potentially expanding the mass deportation machinery in new and horrifying ways. Their 2–1 decision for the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals would transform the entire United States into a permanent border zone where unauthorized immigrants can be jailed indefinitely without bond, even years after they arrived. It supercharges the administration’s push to build an archipelago of mass detention centers larger than any existing jail or prison in the country. These mega-warehouses—which are not designed for human habitation—will hold up to 10,000 immigrants each, with little oversight and little recourse for detainees whose rights are violated. Even as public outrage over Trump’s mass deportation campaign intensifies, the legal and physical infrastructure of the plan are rapidly falling into place.

The 5th Circuit’s Friday decision gives new legal muscle to the Stephen Miller–orchestrated mass deportation campaign by endorsing the administration’s audacious rereading of a 1996 immigration law governing the detention of unauthorized migrants. For nearly 30 years, both the executive branch and the federal judiciary have understood this statute to draw a sharp line between migrants “seeking admission” at the border and those already in the country. The former are subject to mandatory detention without bond (with a few narrow exceptions). The latter, by contrast, can seek release on bond. If that request is denied, they can demand a bond hearing before an immigration judge. Most of the roughly 11 million immigrants without permanent legal status in the U.S. today fall into this second, bond-eligible group.

In July, the Trump administration collapsed the long-standing distinction between new arrivals and everyone else. It announced that it had “revisited” its view of the law and concluded that unauthorized immigrants already present in the United States are subject to mandatory detention, just like migrants encountered at the border. To reach that result, the government asserted that anyone who was never legally admitted to the country must, by definition, be “seeking admission” today. Under its theory, an immigrant who has lived here for decades is subject to the same harsh rules as someone who tried to cross the border yesterday. This shift empowered Immigration and Customs Enforcement to detain exponentially more immigrants without bond, prompting a flood of habeas petitions from those detainees challenging their confinement. Indeed, according to ProPublica, noncitizens have filed more of these petitions in the last 13 months than in the last three administrations combined.

Although the Trump-stacked Board of Immigration Appeals swiftly adopted the administration’s distortion of the statute, federal judges have overwhelmingly rejected it and freed detainees in habeas proceedings. As Kyle Cheney reported in Politico, at least 360 judges have spurned the government’s reasoning in more than 3,000 cases. They’ve done so in increasingly alarmed terms. Last week, Judge Thomas E. Johnston, a George W. Bush appointee, wrote: “It is appalling that the government insists that this Court should redefine or completely disregard the current law as it is clearly written,” deriding the administration’s theory as “dystopian absurdity.”

The problem, as these judges have explained, is that an unauthorized immigrant who’s already present in the country is not “seeking admission” at all; they are seeking to remain here. Yet ICE is detaining them under a statute reserved for new arrivals. By doing so, the agency is flagrantly breaking the law. So judges keep ordering ICE to release detainees—orders the agency has repeatedly flouted, prompting scathing judicial rebukes around the country.

On Friday, however, the administration finally caught a break at the 5th Circuit, the nation’s most reactionary appeals court. Justice Department officials maneuvered to ensure that the court would take up the question as quickly as possible, evidently hoping to notch a win. Two far-right judges, Edith Jones and Kyle Duncan, were happy to oblige: They embraced the administration’s reinterpretation on an expedited schedule, over a furious dissent by Judge Dana Douglas, who warned: “The border is now everywhere.” With this decision in hand, ICE can enforce the mandatory detention policy in Texas, Louisiana, and Mississippi, the three states covered by the circuit. (The agency had been funneling migrants from other jurisdictions into these states already, perhaps in anticipation of such a ruling.)

Jones and Duncan’s rush to bless this mandatory detention policy smooths the path for another component of Trump’s mass deportation push: The use of mega-warehouses to detain up to 10,000 noncitizens each and supplement the much smaller facilities that currently house detainees. ICE has been buying up these warehouses over the last few months—reportedly above market value to speed up the transactions—and converting them into makeshift detention camps. More than a quarter of the proposed sites fall within the 5th Circuit. As the American Immigration Council’s Aaron Reichlin-Melnick has pointed out, these detention facilities will house far more people than any jail or prison in the U.S. today.

Reichlin-Melnick told me on Tuesday that the mandatory detention policy now supported by the 5th Circuit is “a key part of the plan to fill these warehouses.” To achieve “the broader project of mass deportation,” Reichlin-Melnick said, “you need both the legal authority and physical space.” The government’s draconian rereading of immigration law “provides the legal authority. Warehouses provide the physical spaces.”

The overarching goal is to condemn as many noncitizens as possible to these sites, then hold them there without bond until they are so desperate and miserable that they agree to be deported. ICE already subjects its detainees to horrific, degrading, and inhumane conditions while blocking attempts at meaningful oversight. The situation may grow even more dire once the agency begins locking hundreds of thousands of noncitizens—many of whom may have lived here for years with pending legal claims to resolve their status—in industrial buildings that were never designed to hold human beings. Those subject to abuse at the hands of ICE officers will have no real mechanism for redress.

Even before the mandatory detention policy, noncitizens faced an uphill battle when seeking bond before an immigration judge. Trump purged many of these judges (who lack tenure) for alleged leniency, replacing them with ideologically aligned substitutes. But release on bond was still a real possibility for those who could show that they did not pose a flight risk or danger to the community. Now the government has shut off that safety valve, and—at least in the 5th Circuit—the machinery of detention can run at full speed. A series of Supreme Court decisions have closed off the possibility of a nationwide injunction or class action that could put a stop to this regime all at once. Immigrants’ only hope is that SCOTUS will swiftly and definitively shoot down the government’s contortion of the statute.

There is some reason for optimism that it will. Just eight years ago, the conservative justices appeared to foreclose the conflation of new arrivals and longer-term residents, acknowledging that the latter group is eligible for bond. But this Supreme Court has repeatedly twisted the law for Trump, particularly in his quest to immiserate noncitizens, and there’s no guarantee it will resist this act of legal vandalism. The administration is proceeding as if it already has the justices in its pocket. Unless and until they intervene, each new warehouse moves the country one step closer to the president’s vision of an American gulag.

The past month has seen a barrage of election subversion stories that, taken individually, were alarming, but viewed together reveal a deeply disturbing new playbook emanating from the Trump administration ahead of the midterms. On this week’s Amicus podcast, Dahlia Lithwick talked with election law gladiator Marc Elias, chair of Elias Law Group and founder of Democracy Docket. Their discussion, edited and condensed for clarity here, highlights a very clear pattern when it comes to Trump and voting: a project that seeks to normalize violence and to test drive the shattering of how elections are typically run. The work of the coming nine months? Keep a close eye on the encroaching lawlessness, don’t normalize election subversion, and organize now to protect your friends and neighbors.

Dahlia Lithwick: When Steve Bannon pledged last week that ICE is going to “surround the polls”—that the federal government is going to send Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers to patrol polling stations during the midterms—is he trolling, or something we should be taking literally and seriously?

Marc Elias: I don’t think he’s trolling us, I think he’s quite serious. I think Donald Trump wants to maintain optionality here. Trump has put federal paramilitary forces in a number of American cities. Everyone’s focused on Minneapolis, but let’s be clear, it’s not only Minneapolis. Part of it is because he obviously has an anti-immigrant agenda he wants to pursue, but he also wants to normalize the idea of seeing people with flash-bang grenades and tear gas breaking windows and dragging people out of cars, and telling U.S. citizens that they’re being put in databases, and grabbing U.S. citizens and throwing them in the back of vans. Trump wants to normalize all of that because that has a number of side benefits, none so great as potentially using those same forces and same tactics around the midterm elections—not to go after noncitizens, and not even specifically focused on being right around polling places, but just more generally making it more intimidating to vote, making it more inconvenient to get to polling locations, and in its most extreme form, yes, surrounding polling locations and intimidating people or preventing voting altogether.

So I guess the follow-up is just my lawyerly question, which is: Of course it’s not lawful to deploy federal troops or armed federal law enforcement to polling places. The Brennan Center is very clear—it’s a crime for anyone in the military to interfere with elections. So doesn’t this discussion begin and end with the fact that you just can’t?

It doesn’t, for two reasons. First of all, we began the administration with people thinking, Oh my God, what if he puts the military at the polls? And I think Donald Trump has figured out that he’s better off with paramilitary forces than the actual U.S. military. The military may be too disciplined and too principled to do what he wants here, so he’s found other federal law enforcement personnel and agencies willing to do his dirty work. We’ve seen that progression between L.A.—where we saw the National Guard deployed—and now Minneapolis, where we’ve seen ICE and Border Patrol.

More fundamentally, though, what you have is a president who himself enjoys absolute immunity and will wield the pardon power, and that makes saying something is “illegal” a lot less of a credible threat. When you also have a Department of Justice that would never prevent them from doing those things, and in fact would go to court to enable those things … it doesn’t take law off the table, and I never want people to think that the courts are not able to address some of these things, because I think, in fact, the courts have proven the most capable of being checks on Donald Trump. I can promise you lawyers like me will be in court, and we will fight against this, and we may very well win, but it doesn’t mean that he won’t try or that he won’t actually get cooperation from his own administration to do these things.

Also last week, President Trump said the time has come to “nationalize elections.” Can you talk us through what lies beneath that threat? Is there some tangible plan he’s referencing, or is this just another one of his I want what I want and I want it now, and I want these 15 Democratic jurisdictions to be monitored by me.

I think a couple of things here are important. The first is that when he says he wants to “nationalize” the elections, I fear some people think that he’s talking about something like uniform standards across the country, some terrible but nevertheless uniform application of voting standards that would apply in Alabama equally as they would  apply in, say, New York.

But if you look at the broader quote, he’s making false claims about people coming to the country illegally to vote, and then he says, “It’s amazing that the Republicans aren’t tougher on it. The Republicans should say, ‘We want to take over, we should take over the voting.’ The voting in at least many, 15 places. The Republicans ought to nationalize the voting.” So I want to be clear, he’s not talking about nationalizing election administration. He is talking about Republicans taking over the voting, and then identifying that there would be specific jurisdictions in which they would take over that voting. We can assume that those 15 would grow to be beyond 15, and that it would be places with large concentrations of Democratic votes. He’s talking about a partisan takeover, not a federal-versus-state takeover.

The second thing is, I think that the big lie that he is selling in 2026 is his own power regarding these elections. What he’s really doing in this statement is he’s suggesting that the president has powers over elections that he doesn’t have. What we’re seeing is a progression and an escalation. I want everyone to go back in their heads and remember that 2020 didn’t start with a violent insurrection of the nation’s Capitol, it actually started with Donald Trump before the election, well before the election, saying that we can’t have all these mail-in ballots, right? He was railing against mail-in ballots, and then there was litigation before the election about mail-in voting, and in-person voting, and all kinds of stuff, and many in the traditional legacy media treated that as if it was the normal jockeying before elections, and people like me and you were saying, “No! This is actually not normal, this is actually quite extraordinary!”

Then Donald Trump loses the election, and he files not one lawsuit, but he and his allies file 64 lawsuits—which, again, completely not normal! If you go back, maybe in the totality of Bush v. Gore, with all of the subsidiary little issues, maybe there were a dozen cases? But that was one state involving a very, very close margin, decided by the Supreme Court. In 2020, this was a scattershot approach with a lot of bullshit legal theories. And when that didn’t work, he escalated. This is the pivot point that people sometimes look past. On Dec. 19, 2020, after the Electoral College met, the state of Texas filed a petition directly in the U.S. Supreme Court. You know how unusual that is? Texas didn’t go to the trial courts, it just went straight to the U.S. Supreme Court and said, We need you to throw out the election results in four states. This is unheard of. Mike Johnson, who is now the speaker of the House but was at that point a back-bencher, organized 126 Republican members of Congress to sign onto that brief as an amicus. That became a major pivot point, because it was as much a political organizing as it was a legal organizing, and it winds up building up to House Republicans trying to refuse to certify the election Jan. 6, and then the violence and the insurrection we saw on Jan. 6.

That was the progression in 2020. As we look today, we’re seeing the beginnings of the same progression: Donald Trump, first attacking voting, his Department of Justice bringing litigation, which they are losing. Now you see the seizing of ballots in Georgia, and you start to see the rhetoric from Steve Bannon about surrounding the polls. This is the progression that Trump goes through, and I think everyone needs to be really worried.

You just mentioned the FBI search of a warehouse in Fulton County, Georgia, last week, which followed persistent demands from the president, claiming without evidence that fraud cost him Georgia. They used the opportunity to seize almost 700 boxes of 2020 election documents, all in the presence of Tulsi Gabbard, director of national intelligence, who was on the scene for that raid. Can you explain why it’s a big deal, having the DNI present for an FBI raid in Georgia?

Yes, and there’s another fact that has been way too much overlooked: The prosecutor who sought this search warrant is in Missouri; this was not out of the U.S. Attorney’s Office in Georgia. From reporting, it appears this U.S. attorney out of a district in Missouri has jurisdiction not only over the 2020 Fulton County matter (to the extent that it is a matter), but also some kind of nationwide jurisdiction over all election “things.”

When you take in his involvement and you take in Gabbard’s involvement, I think you need to recast this as not simply election nihilism about 2020, and not only as a fight about nostalgia—which would still be terrible, unprecedented, and dangerous—but that would be one thing. I think this raid is about proof of concept for the future. People are talking about seizing ballots and surrounding polling places and stealing elections as if somehow these things are easily done. These are conceptual frameworks that people in the administration have to get comfortable with; these are moral frameworks they have to get comfortable with. They have to contend with the Constitution and the law and judges and all that, but they also have to contend with just the sheer logistics of it all: How do we actually do this thing where there are ballots in the possession of a county official? And how are we going to get them, and how are we going to then count them in a way that is going to cast doubt on the outcome, or cast doubt on the outcome through other propaganda and disinformation campaigns? This Georgia raid is just as much about all that as it is about 2020.

Donald Trump and his administration actually managed to pull something off here. They actually did seize ballots, they actually got their hands on them. People can say “Oh, they had the wrong warrant and they had to go back,” but at the end of the day, Tulsi Gabbard was on a truck full of documents seized from an office, and those are now in the possession of the FBI and presumably a grand jury by this prosecutor from Missouri. That should be terrifying. In terms of alarm bells, this is off the charts. They faced a challenge in 2020 and were humiliated in how to subvert the outcome of an election, and Donald Trump told the New York Times that he wished he had seized the ballots in 2020. They have now shown they have a proof of concept, that they know logistically how to do this—including getting a federal magistrate judge to sign a warrant. That is not a small matter, that is a safeguard put in place to prevent the abuse of grand juries, the abuse of subpoenas, and the abuse of arrest warrants. They got through that process, and that is a learning exercise that they will use going forward to 2026, and it is the thing that I probably worry the most about.

Pete Hegseth, perhaps the most thuggish, toadying, all-around underqualified secretary of defense in the job’s nearly 80-year history, has now shown himself to be the most institutionally destructive as well.

His announcement on Friday, that he was cutting the department’s ties to Harvard University—and possibly to other centers of higher learning too—reflects not only a smug anti-intellectualism, which is out of sync with a high-tech modern military, but also a total misunderstanding of how and why its ties to academia first came about.

“For too long,” Hegseth said in a video, “this department has sent our best and brightest officers to Harvard, hoping the university would better understand and appreciate our warrior class. Instead, too many of our officers came back looking too much like Harvard—heads full of globalist and radical ideologies that do not improve our fighting ranks. … We train warriors, not wokesters. Harvard, good riddance.”

From start to finish, this speech is pure rubbish.

The need to broaden the education of America’s warriors was first perceived by Gen. George Marshall, the U.S. Army’s chief of staff during World War II (hardly an emblem of woke). Marshall relied heavily on the chief of his Strategy and Policy Group, Brig. Gen. George Lincoln. (I delved into his papers at the West Point Archives for Chapter 1 of my 2013 book The Insurgents: David Petraeus and the Plot to Change the American Way of War.)

In the last year of the war—at age 37 the Army’s youngest general officer—Lincoln met with Marshall daily, coordinated every major military campaign, and helped draft the treaties at Yalta and Potsdam, which shaped the political map of postwar Europe. He then assisted Marshall’s replacement, Gen. Dwight Eisenhower, in creating the Department of Defense.

The special thing about Lincoln was, after graduating from the U.S. Military Academy at West Point in 1929, he won a Rhodes scholarship and spent the next three years at Oxford, studying philosophy, politics, and economics—then returned to West Point to teach before getting assigned to high-level staff jobs after WWII broke out.

While working with Marshall at the various Allied planning conferences, Lincoln noticed that much of the crucial work was done by a handful of fellow military officers, almost all of whom had also been Rhodes scholars. He did a little research and found that West Point had produced 13 Rhodes scholars in its history. Of the six still alive, four were holding senior policy posts, helping set the terms of military strategy and postwar peace treaties.

As the war ended, the United States was emerging as a global power with global responsibilities. It would need leaders well versed in politics, diplomacy, economics, and strategy. But few such people existed in or out of the military. Certainly West Point, Lincoln’s alma mater, wasn’t training such people. At the time, all its cadets took the same courses, which focused mainly on engineering. There was a course on bridge building, but no courses on military history.

In May 1945, less than two weeks after the end of the war, Lincoln wrote a letter to one of his mentors back at West Point. “I am beginning to think that what we need is a type of staff officer with at least three heads—one political, one economic, and one military.” In another letter, he proposed “baptizing practically all officers” with a “sprinkling” of education in politics, history, and economics, while taking “certain selected” officers and “dunking” them in those waters much more deeply.

The Army, he continued, “can no longer afford to depend on the fortuitous assembly of Rhodes Scholars. … There must be an integrated system of high-level training if Army policy and national policy are properly to be served, a system which begins here at West Point.”

Lincoln could easily have gone on to have a storied career, rising through the Army’s officer corps. Instead, he returned to West Point to create a new department of social sciences, which would mold this new system. Since regulations required that department heads be colonels, not generals, Lincoln even took a demotion in his rank and was never again promoted.

He started his new job on Sept. 1, 1947. He and Col. Herman Beukema, his onetime mentor and now the new department’s co-founder, created courses in history, government, foreign affairs, geography, national-security economics, and international relations. Lincoln also wrote the nation’s first college-level textbook on international politics, a reference that was assigned not only at West Point but at several civilian colleges across the country.

Over time, cadets concentrating in social sciences formed an elite enclave, which became an object of resentment and ridicule among some more hidebound officers. As late as 1991, when Gen. “Stormin’ Norman” Schwarzkopf returned from his command of Operation Desert Storm to deliver a rousing victory speech at West Point, he reminisced about his own days as a cadet and poked fun at the crazy ideas advanced by “a couple of left-wing pinko Social Science instructors.”

Schwarzkopf was mining a well-known stereotype. (Even at this late date, some of the cadets laughed at and applauded his remark.) He was only half joking, however. Some of his own staff officers had been products of “Sosh,” the academy’s nickname for the social sciences department. But Schwarzkopf’s jab (minus the humor) is the view that Hegseth now holds of the entire enterprise: seeing war as nothing more than killing. In this view, all other dimensions of warfare—the idea that soldiers should understand the enemy they’re fighting, interpret their tactics in a strategic context, and stay within the confines of international law—are not merely secondary but counterproductive, contrary to a “warrior spirit,” woke.

Lincoln had another purpose in creating the new department. “I am certain,” he wrote in one letter, “that we must make strenuous efforts … to improve the so-called Army mind.” This would mean, above all, “impressing the student with the fact that the basic requirement is to learn to think—sometimes a very painful process.”

Perhaps more than anything else, this is what Hegseth sees, and fears, in the officers who have earned degrees or fellowships at places like Harvard. This spirit of inquiry, curiosity, and criticism is what he defines as “woke.”

Early on in the development of Sosh, Lincoln put in place a rule allowing cadets who did especially well in his courses to go study at a civilian graduate school, with West Point paying their tuition. In exchange, these cadets, after earning their master’s or doctoral degrees, would come back to teach in the Sosh department for at least three years. Once they fulfilled that obligation, Lincoln would use his still-considerable connections in Washington to get them choice assignments in the Pentagon, the State Department, the White House, a foreign embassy, or a prestigious command post.

Lincoln died in 1975, but the Sosh tradition lived on. Today almost all general officers in the U.S. Army (and also in the Air Force, which was a branch of the Army until 1947, when it became an independent service) hold graduate degrees—and most of them, at least the generals I know, are as proud of their degrees as they are of their ranks.

For instance, Gen. David Petraeus, commander of the more successful phases of the war in Iraq, went to West Point, then earned a Ph.D. at Princeton University. Gen. H.R. McMaster, who was a lethal tank commander and a counterinsurgency strategist in Iraq (as well as, briefly, national security adviser during Donald Trump’s first term as president), followed a similar path, getting his Ph.D. from the University of North Carolina.

Maybe Hegseth sees those officers as epitomes of woke. But what about the current chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Dan Caine, appointed and lauded by Trump and his entire team, including Hegseth? His page on the JCS website states that Caine “has completed a range of national security and leadership courses, including Harvard Kennedy School’s course for Senior Executives in National and International Security.”

Someone should ask Caine, the next time he appears at a press conference or a congressional hearing, whether his spirit and skill as a warrior and a citizen were helped or hindered by his Ivy League exposure. Maybe Hegseth should have asked the question—and maybe he should think and read up even a little bit about a vast range of topics before opening his mouth.

As I followed a patrol of federal agents around New York City’s Chinatown during their fumbling attempted raid in mid-October last year, I noticed something curious. I was following a small group with the immediately recognizable style of Stephen Miller’s paramilitaristic vanguard: baggy street clothes, masked faces, weapons, and ballistic vests without specific insignia, just the catchall “POLICE” or “Federal Agent.” As we turned one corner, we walked past two other agents dressed much the same, except that one wore a vest that did have agency identification, and it wasn’t Immigration and Customs Enforcement or Customs and Border Protection; it read “IRS-CI,” for the Internal Revenue Service’s Criminal Investigation division.

This is not typically what IRS-CI does. The comparatively small federal law enforcement agency, like the majority of its counterparts, is specialized around one area of enforcement, in this case tasked with investigating criminal violations of the tax code—complex investigations requiring particularized skills, which is why the IRS’ own job portal encourages “expertise in accounting.” It is not part of the Department of Homeland Security or even the Department of Justice, residing under the IRS in the Treasury Department.

Yet here was an IRS-CI agent on a foot patrol during a much larger operation that seemed primarily geared toward detaining random men whom agents deemed likely to be African, and she wasn’t an anomaly. As a well-placed source confirmed to me contemporaneously, the operation had hastily brought in dozens of agents from ICE, the Drug Enforcement Agency, the FBI, and the IRS, potentially among other agencies. This approach itself is not now abnormal; per figures obtained and published by the Cato Institute last September, an eye-watering 28,390 federal law enforcement personnel as of August had been detailed to ICE’s Enforcement and Removal Operations, the component that handles immigration arrests and detention.

About 17,500 of these came from either ICE’s criminal-focused division, Homeland Security Investigations, or CBP, but that leaves over 10,000 coming from entities that are not focused on immigration enforcement at all. The IRS provided 1,771, which out of a total special agent population of about 2,100, means about 84 percent of its agent workforce was detailed to ICE Enforcement and Removal Operations. The DEA provided 3,417, which would be some 70 percent of its special agent workforce. Thousands more came from the FBI; Alcohol, Firearms, Tobacco and Explosives; and even the State Department’s Diplomatic Security service.

This reality has been covered mostly from the standpoint of it taking agents away from crucial other tasks, ranging from child exploitation to financial crimes to drug trafficking (the latter of which notably forms the pretext for a lot of the Trump administration’s domestic enforcement push). But it also has some concrete implications for accountability; not only are agents often neither named nor identified, their agencies themselves are unclear.

Some observers noted that Attorney General Pam Bondi simply referred to “federal agents” in her X post and subsequent comments on the arrest of several people including journalists Don Lemon and Georgia Fort last week. In a video Fort posted to Facebook, an agent wearing a DEA vest can be seen peering through her window; it’s unclear which agency the others belonged to.

We are no longer talking about individual law enforcement agencies, but rather a giant, singular blob. The burgeoning momentum in what has been a stultified Democratic congressional minority’s effort to rein in some of ICE’s actions—partly compelled by public horror at the killings of Renee Good and Alex Pretti in Minneapolis—will have to contend with the fact of this blob. Lawmakers have been pushing for the DHS inspector general to probe the agency’s use of force, among other things, but will this inquiry encompass abuses potentially committed by other agencies’ personnel? Who’s to say which agency is even involved in any given operation?

Democrats are also now negotiating over (relatively small-bore) constraints like mandating body cameras and limiting masks as they work to hold up DHS funding. They should consider that language too narrowly tailored to ICE and CBP is potentially going to miss DEA agents, for example, detailed to the exact same job. The funding freeze itself—which might have limited overall impact in light of the multibillion-dollar orgy of funding already bestowed on ICE in last year’s so-called Big Beautiful Bill—won’t touch the operations of, say, the Department of Justice, which houses the ATF, Marshals, and Bureau of Prisons, all of which have seen agents deployed with ICE.

This amorphous and ever-shifting group of agents drawn from across the federal government looks increasingly like a catchall national police force operating at the direction of the White House itself, used for diffuse political goals like immigration enforcement, speech crackdowns, and occupying politically oppositional cities. While different federal agencies have long collaborated on joint investigations, this appears to be much more like absorption than collaboration. The underlying agencies still exist, of course, but their agent workforces are substantially or even mostly no longer part of them, instead existing as part of this national police blob.

This also shifts the question of capacity. ICE has been going on a messy hiring push to try to significantly beef up its numbers, though the results may take a while to fully manifest. Yet this means that, without hiring a single additional recruit, ICE ERO has just about tripled its workforce as its mission keeps shifting to include its general immigration functions plus additional White House priorities. It has been suggested by Steve Bannon and others that Trump would deploy members of this law enforcement blob during November’s midterms to monitor polling places and potentially intimidate voters. While the administration’s pseudo-sieges of cities have the limiting factor of ICE’s and CBP’s headcount, these are pools of already trained and equipped federal agents that they can draw from other entities to expand this footprint.

They probably already have; though a DOJ attorney told a federal judge that the 3,000-strong surge of agents to the Twin Cities included 2,000 ICE personnel, we don’t really know if this includes agents detailed to ICE from other agencies. The administration does not publicly disclose how many agents from which agencies have been reassigned to ICE ERO, nor where they’re deployed or what they’re doing. In the context of agents prowling around cities, arresting people seemingly at random and occasionally killing protesters, the specific seal on any given agent’s badge might seem inconsequential, but if state authorities and lawmakers want to get serious about oversight and accountability for these authoritarian operations, they will need to understand the scope, nature, and composition of this federal force.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Cisco is on track to deliver its unified management tool Cloud Control later in 2026, but while its users wait for that moment it’s pumping out plenty more agentic tools to manage their networks – and make sure agents behave.

The job of agentic babysitter goes to a new AI Agent Monitoring tool for Splunk’s Observability Cloud. We’re told it visualizes agent workflows and can track the performance, cost, quality, and behavior of LLM and agentic applications. Splunkers can take it for a spin two weeks from now.

Cisco will integrate the new Splunk tool with AI Defense, the suite it announced last year, which makes sure LLMs don’t misbehave or create risks, scans for AI-powered applications, governs their behavior with guardrails, and sniffs out unauthorized or unexpected LLM-powered programs to ensure they can’t escape policy and supervision.

The networking giant made AI Defense generally available this week and celebrated that milestone by adding extra capabilities, including the ability to catalog of Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers an enterprise uses in-house and elsewhere. Again the plan here is helping users to spot systems that might have escaped their policies and AI guardrails.

Cisco also added automated red-teaming tools to test the security of models and associated infrastructure. Switchzilla designed this one to run on prem so queries and prompts don’t have to leave the building, but it can still target off-prem resources.

And in a nod to the necessity of complying with older operational models, Cisco has mapped AI Defense to AI frameworks from NIST, OWASP, and MITRE.

The company has also announced plenty more agents to automate campus, branch, and industrial networks. By mid-year, Cisco will offer autonomous troubleshooting, continuous optimization that notices and fixes poor network performance, plus tools to ensure that whatever an agent recommends doesn’t go dangerously beyond operational baselines. Cisco also promises the ability to create agentic workflows.

Firewall users will get proactive recommendations for new zero trust controls, and agents to deploy them if you trust a machine to do the job.

For now, Cisco will make these agents and tools available in its AI Canvas – its agentic network management interface. But the company plans to unify that tool, and its other management tools, into a single offering called Cloud Control.

Cisco last year announced the unification of its Meraki and Catalyst dashboards, plus the ability to manage both NX-OS and ACI fabrics with the Nexus Dashboard. The Register attended that announcement, which produced spontaneous cheers from the Cisco Live USA crowd.

That positive reaction suggests Cloud Control will find an enthusiastic audience once it debuts, which we’re told will be deep into 2026. We&#39;ll see whether that most receptive audience is execs who see a chance to cut costs, or networking pros freed of scutwork. ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">LayerX, a security company based in Tel Aviv, says it has identified a zero-click remote code execution vulnerability in Claude Desktop Extensions that can be triggered by processing a Google Calendar entry.

Informed of the issue – worthy of a CVSS score of 10/10, LayerX argues – Anthropic has opted not to address it.

Claude Desktop Extensions, recently renamed MCP Bundles, are packaged applications that extend the capabilities of Claude Desktop using the Model Context Protocol, a standard way to give generative AI models access to other software and data. Stored as .dxt files (with Anthropic transitioning the format to .mcpb), they are ZIP archives that package a local MCP server alongside a manifest.json file describing the extension’s capabilities.

The Claude Desktop Extensions hub webpage claims the extensions are secure and undergo security review. &quot;Extensions run in sandboxed environments with explicit permission controls, and enterprise features include Group Policy support and extension blocklisting,&quot; the FAQs explain.

LayerX argues otherwise. According to principal security researcher Roy Paz, Claude Desktop extensions &quot;execute without sandboxing and with full privileges on the host system.&quot;

Paz told The Register, &quot;By design, you cannot sandbox something if it is expected to have full system access. Perhaps they containerize it but that&#39;s not the same thing. Relative to Windows Sandbox, Sandboxie or VMware, Claude DXT&#39;s container falls noticeably short of what is expected from a sandbox. From an attacker&#39;s point of view it is the equivalent of setting your building code to 1234 and then leaving it unlocked because locking it would prevent delivery people from coming in and out.&quot;

Paz says that the vulnerability arises from the fact that Claude will process input from public-facing connectors like Google Calendar and that the AI model also decides on its own which installed MCP connectors should be used to fulfill that request.

The result is that when extensions with risky capabilities like command line access are present, extensions with less concerning capabilities can present an attack vector. In this instance, a Google Calendar event was used to make malicious instructions available to Claude, which the model then used to download, compile, and execute harmful code.

&quot;There are no hardcoded safeguards that prevent Claude from constructing a malformed or dangerous workflow,&quot; Paz claims. &quot;Consequently, data extracted from a relatively low-risk connector (Google Calendar) can be forwarded directly into a local MCP server with code-execution capabilities.&quot;

What Paz is describing is a form of indirect prompt injection – AI models that read webpages, other documents, or interface elements may interpret that content as instructions. This is a known, unresolved problem, which may explain Anthropic&#39;s apparent disinterest in the LayerX report.

In this case, Paz found that when Claude is directed to process a Google Calendar event (enabled by an extension), it will carry out malicious instructions contained therein if it has access to relevant MCP tools (e.g. Desktop Commander, an MCP server for granting terminal access).

Paz presented Claude with the prompt, &quot;Please check my latest events in google cal and then take care of it for me,&quot; so the AI model scanned the event, saw a task containing instructions to download, compile, and launch the proof-of-concept code, and then carried out that task.

&quot;This requires no user interaction, no confirmation prompt, and no explicit request for system-level automation,&quot; Paz said in his post. &quot;The result is a full remote code execution, meriting a CVSS score of 10/10.&quot;

The risk for Claude users is that some miscreant might send a Google Calendar invitation that contains instructions to fetch malware. All that would be required to trigger the vulnerability would be to ask Claude to handle the event and for Claude to have terminal access, assuming no other mitigations have been implemented.

According to Paz, &quot;LayerX approached Anthropic with our findings, but the company decided not to fix it at this time.&quot;

Paz provided us with a copy of Anthropic&#39;s response to the vulnerability report:

After reviewing your report, we&#39;ve determined that this falls outside our current threat model. Claude Desktop&#39;s MCP integration is designed as a local development tool that operates within the user&#39;s own environment. Users explicitly configure and grant permissions to MCP servers they choose to run locally, and these servers have access to resources based on the user&#39;s permissions.

The scenario you&#39;ve described involves the interaction between multiple MCP connectors that a user has intentionally installed and granted permission to run without permission prompts. Since users maintain full control over which MCP servers they enable and the permissions those servers have, the security boundary is defined by the user&#39;s configuration choices and their system&#39;s existing security controls.

The Register asked Anthropic to comment but we&#39;ve not heard back. ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">GPUs are so hot right now – literally and metaphorically – that they’re driving mergers and acquisitions in the datacenter cooling industry.

On Tuesday, aircon company Trane acquired yet another liquid cooling startup, LiquidStack.

You may recall LiquidStack was one of the early players in two-phase immersion cooling, and first dunked servers into tanks of dielectric liquids to cool down crypto mining operations.

Microsoft was among the first to trial LiquidStack&#39;s tech all the way back in 2021. Since then, the company has expanded its portfolio to include both single-phase and dual-phase immersion tanks, plus direct-to-chip cooling technologies, including a rather beefy 10MW modular coolant distribution unit (CDU).

Under the arrangement announced today, LiquidStack will continue to operate under Trane&#39;s commercial HVAC business unit.

LiquidStack&#39;s tech adds to Trane’s existing datacenter physical infrastructure portfolio, a segment that has become big business in recent years as demand for AI and other hot infrastructure grows.

By 2030, analyst firm Dell&#39;Oro Group predicts, the datacenter physical infrastructure market will exceed $80 billion. One of the fastest-growing segments in that market is thermal management, which the analyst outfit predicts will achieve a compound annual growth rate of 20 percent.

By the end of the decade, Dell&#39;Oro says, direct-to-chip liquid cooling alone will be an $8 billion business driven in large part by the tech that featured in many Super Bowl ads: AI.

Liquid cooling is no longer a nice-to-have but a requirement to get the most out of the latest AI hardware, which makes thermal management tech a potential bottleneck for adoption.

LiquidStack isn&#39;t Trane&#39;s first foray into liquid cooling. Back in December 2025, the company snapped up Stellar Energy, which produced modular cooling plants and coolant distribution units for, among other things, datacenters.

But these are only the latest in a string of datacenter physical infrastructure M&A kicked off by the AI boom. In late 2024, Schneider Electric acquired a 75 percent controlling interest in liquid cooling vendor Motivair with plans to purchase the remaining 25 percent by 2028.

Roughly a year prior, Vertiv purchased CoolTera and almost immediately sent the company&#39;s manufacturing line into overdrive increasing production of CDUs by 45x.

Trane expects to close the acquisition of LiquidStack early this year. ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">What better way to say I love you than with an update? Attackers exploited a whopping six Microsoft bugs as zero-days prior to Redmond releasing software fixes on February&#39;s Patch Tuesday.

For comparison, last month we saw just one Windows vulnerability under attack before the January Patch Tuesday fix.

Of course, then there&#39;s also the emergency patches released because the first try didn&#39;t plug the security hole - but that&#39;s a different story.

As always, Microsoft did not provide any additional details about who attacked these six flaws and how widespread exploitation may be. But considering that three of the six are also listed as publicly disclosed - meaning there may already be proof-of-concept exploits floating around the internet - we expect to see more reports (and details) about active exploitation soon.

Here&#39;s what we do know about the six CVEs under attack, and you can read about all 59 Microsoft CVEs here.

Windows Shell Security Feature Bypass Vulnerability (CVE-2026-21510): Exploiting this bug, which received an 8.8 CVSS rating, requires an attacker to convince a user to open a malicious link or shortcut file - but we all know that most people will click on just about anything, so that&#39;s not difficult to pull off. Once the user opens the malicious link, the attacker can bypass Windows SmartScreen and Windows Shell security prompts to execute code on the victim&#39;s system without user warning or consent.

As Trend Micro Zero Day Initiative&#39;s Dustin Childs warns, &quot;this bug is listed as a security feature bypass, but it could also be classified as code execution ... Definitely test and deploy this fix quickly.&quot;

In addition to being marked &quot;exploitation detected,&quot; Microsoft lists this bug as being publicly disclosed.

Internet Explorer Security Feature Bypass Vulnerability (CVE-2026-21513): This bug also received an 8.8 CVSS rating, is under attack and publicly known, and could lead to remote code execution (RCE). It&#39;s another flaw where the attacker needs to convince a user to open a malicious HTML file or shortcut (.lnk) file delivered through a link, email attachment, or download. After the user clicks on the link, however, it&#39;s game over.

&quot;The specially crafted file manipulates browser and Windows Shell handling, causing the content to be executed by the operating system,&quot; Redmond explained. &quot;This allows the attacker to bypass security features and potentially achieve code execution.&quot;

The potential silver lining: since Internet Explorer on Windows support ended years ago, in 2022, hopefully there&#39;re not a whole lot of people still using this retired browser.

Microsoft Word Security Feature Bypass Vulnerability (CVE-2026-21514): The theme of February&#39;s Patch Tuesday does seem to be about bypassing security features, and this flaw that&#39;s also publicly known is another example. This flaw received a 7.8 CVSS and all it requires is a user to open a malicious Office file, thus giving the attacker access to COM (Component Object Model) and OLE (Object Linking and Embedding) controls, which can be abused for RCE. Luckily, the Preview Pane is not an attack vector.

Desktop Window Manager Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability (CVE-2026-21519): This one wasn&#39;t disclosed prior to the software update, and that&#39;s good because an attacker who exploits this bug can gain SYSTEM privileges. It received a 7.8 CVSS rating.

As Childs notes, &quot;This is the second month in a row that a DWM was listed as being exploited in the wild. That leads me to believe the first patch didn&#39;t completely resolve the vulnerability.&quot;

Windows Remote Access Connection Manager Denial of Service Vulnerability (CVE-2026-21525): This 6.2-rated bug is triggered by a null pointer dereference in Windows Remote Access Connection Manager that allows an unauthorized attacker to deny service locally.

Windows Remote Desktop Services Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability (CVE-2026-21533): Another bad bug that allows an authorized attacker to elevate privileges locally and then run code with SYSTEM privileges.

            <h2>Microsoft touts far-off high-temperature superconducting tech for datacenter efficiency</h2>
            <p><strong>The Register | 2026-02-10</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2026/02/10/microsoft_high_temperature_superconductors_hopium/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Microsoft wants you to know that it has found a new way of saving power at its datacenters using high-temperature superconducting (HTS) power delivery systems. And good news: it&#39;ll be possible ... someday.

Redmond is looking to HTS power delivery systems as a replacement for copper and aluminum wires that wind their ways through modern datacenters for several reasons. Chief among those is improved power delivery efficiency, Azure infrastructure GM Alistair Speirs explained in a blog post Tuesday.

High-temperature superconductors offer lossless power delivery thanks to the elimination of nearly all electrical resistance thanks to cooling provided by liquid nitrogen surrounding the superconducting tape used to move electrical energy. HTS cables don&#39;t generate heat either, and according to Microsoft, are more spacially efficient than traditional cables.

Per Speirs, traditional conductors require datacenter operators to choose between substation expansions, adding more feeders, reducing deployment densities, or simply not enlarging a facility at all. Superconductors could &quot;break this tradeoff,&quot; he noted, by allowing for increased electrical density without a larger physical footprint.

&quot;Microsoft is investigating HTS technology to understand how our datacenters can meet the growing demand for power and how to improve our operational sustainability,&quot; Speirs said. &quot;Because superconductors take up less space to move large amounts of power, they could help us build cleaner, more compact systems.&quot;

Of course, nothing is ever quite as simple as saying, hey, we&#39;ve arrived at a new paradigm of power transmission that&#39;ll solve all our datacenter problems, and Microsoft&#39;s HTS plans are no exception.

HTS cables aren&#39;t widely deployed, even in conventional grid-scale power operations, because they&#39;re expensive and superconducting materials aren&#39;t readily available. According to the European Network of Transmission System Operators for Electricity, after factoring in the cost to cool HTS cables, they&#39;re often more expensive than traditional solutions, and getting high voltage transmission out of the current generation of HTS lines is also a challenge.

Microsoft became an investor in HTS power delivery firm Veir in early 2025 as part of the company&#39;s $75 million series B funding round, and Veir has been involved in developing datacenter HTS systems for Microsoft since then.

But Veir only had its first successful demonstration of a datacenter HTS power delivery system in November. Even then, the demo saw Veir deliver just 3 megawatts of power through a single cable in what it called a &quot;simulated and scalable datacenter environment.&quot;

Veir said it&#39;s moving toward &quot;full commercialization in 2026,&quot; but that doesn&#39;t mean Microsoft will be deploying the tech anytime soon.

&quot;HTS remains in the development and evaluation stage for adoption at Microsoft&#39;s scale,&quot; a company spokesperson told The Register in an email, noting that the technology isn&#39;t new, and Microsoft mentioned its exploration of the HTS due to recent advances in the tech. Nonetheless, it&#39;s still an early project.

&quot;Right now, the focus is on testing, validating and building confidence in the technology with partners,&quot; the Microsoft rep told us. &quot;The work underway now is about understanding where HTS could make sense, and we&#39;re excited by the potential we&#39;re seeing.&quot;

It&#39;s a common refrain in recent datacenter projects: A company claims they&#39;ve changed the game by partnering with the provider of a new technology (e.g., small modular nuclear reactors), but that tech is nowhere near ready for the commercial market, so the old standard (e.g., natural gas power) carries on unimpeded while said company tries to deflect datacenter criticisms (e.g., power transmission costs, emissions, and water usage) by touting its new plans.

Beyond a nebulous claim that HTS transmission lines will reduce &quot;the physical and social footprint of the power infrastructure&quot; of its datacenters, thus &quot;reducing the impact on local communities,&quot; Microsoft doesn&#39;t even bother to make claims of how HTS will benefit anyone but Microsoft, but even that is couched in language suggesting nothing is going to change anytime soon.

&quot;Next-gen superconducting transmission lines ... can accelerate the expansion and interconnection of datacenter sites, speeding up compute deployment to meet the growing global demand,&quot; Speirs said. &quot;But unlocking their full potential will require reexamining traditional power system assumptions and rethinking today&#39;s approaches to power transmission and datacenter design.&quot;

In other words, here&#39;s yet another solution for the problems presented by datacenters that&#39;s naught but a distant dream. ®

            <div id="article-text">A picture is worth a thousand words or, perhaps, a hundred thousand dollars in extra salary. Academics claim that personality traits inferred using AI photo analysis can predict how depicted individuals will fare in the labor market.

They emphasize that they don&#39;t advocate doing so because personality extraction from facial images is fundamentally discriminatory.

Even so, they say, personality screening is already commonplace among admissions and HR committees, and AI tools that offer personality assessment are seeing rapid adoption. So they argue that an academic evaluation of the technology is necessary.

In a paper titled &quot;AI Personality Extraction from Faces: Labor Market Implications,&quot; the authors describe how they used the LinkedIn facial images of over 96,000 MBA graduates to extract subjects&#39; Big Five personality traits – Openness, Conscientiousness, Extraversion, Agreeableness, and Neuroticism.

The machine learning algorithm used was originally described in a 2020 Scientific Reports paper titled &quot;Assessing the Big Five personality traits using real-life static facial images,&quot; one of about two dozen papers cited as &quot;ML-laundered junk science&quot; in a 2024 paper titled &quot;The reanimation of pseudoscience in machine learning and its ethical repercussions.&quot;

The algorithm &quot;uses facial features to predict self-reported personality, rather than others&#39; perceptions of personality based on visual appearance,&quot; according to the authors of the new paper.

By applying this algorithm, the authors found &quot;that personality traits inferred from facial features provide substantial incremental predictive power for labor market outcomes.&quot;

The researchers determined that applying machine learning to infer personality traits from facial images produced accurate predictions for the rank of undergraduate and MBA programs attended by the depicted individual, initial compensation, salary trajectory, and job transitions.

Were an HR department to use a similar technique to assess the personality of managerial applicants, the result could serve as a forecast of the job applicant&#39;s future performance in the labor market – biased though it may be. And that appears to be happening.

Co-author Marina Niessner, assistant professor of finance at Indiana University, told The Register in a phone interview that companies like banks already use personality surveys in hiring and promotion decisions and that AI hiring companies are starting to use technology like Big Five personality trait analysis on video interviews.

&quot;The regulatory environment, as you probably know, is very uncertain,&quot; said Niessner. &quot;And so we don&#39;t think this is necessarily a valid way to do it [or] that companies should be doing it. But I think it&#39;s really important to have an academic evaluation of these methodologies if there&#39;s even going to be a regulatory discussion around this.&quot;

The paper argues that the AI-based screening needs to be considered in conjunction with the alternative, which is human decisions based on physical appearance that may also be inconsistent or biased.

The other atuthors were authors Marius Guenzel (Wharton), Shimon Kogan (Reichman University), and Kelly Shue (Yale University). ®

﻿CFO Amanda McMaster will serve as interim CEO until the company’s board finds a replacement.

Robert Playter, CEO of Boston Dynamics, announced on Tuesday that he is stepping down from his role effective immediately and leaving the company on February 27th, as previously reported by A3. Under Playter’s leadership, Boston Dynamics navigated its way through an acquisition from Softbank that brought it to Hyundai in 2021, and it launched a new all-electric version of its humanoid Atlas robot in 2024. Just a few days ago, the company posted another video of its research Atlas robots attempting tumbling passes and outdoor runs as more enterprise-ready editions start to roll out.

Boston Dynamics announced at CES last month that Atlas robots will begin working in Hyundai’s car plants starting in 2028, as the robotics field has become increasingly crowded by competitors like Tesla and Figure, as well as AI companies with “world model” tech built for robots.

Playter has been at Boston Dynamics for over 30 years and has served as CEO since 2020, replacing the company’s original CEO, Marc Raibert. Boston Dynamics CFO Amanda McMaster will serve as interim CEO while the company’s board of directors searches for Playter’s replacement.

“Boston Dynamics has been the ride of a lifetime. What this place has become has exceeded anything I could have ever imagined all those years ago in our funky lab in the basement of the MIT Media Lab,” Playter said in a letter to employees, which was shared with The Verge. He also highlighted the company’s successes with its Spot, Stretch, and Atlas robots.

“From the earliest days of hopping robots, to the world’s first quadrupeds, to spearheading the entire humanoid industry, Playter made his mark as a pioneer of innovation. He transformed Boston Dynamics from a small research and development lab into a successful business that now proudly calls itself the global leader in mobile robotics,” Nikolas Noel, VP of marketing and communications at Boston Dynamics, said in a statement to The Verge, adding, “He will be sorely missed, but we hope he enjoys some well-deserved time off. Thanks Rob.”

Plus: DC thinks Bezos is a bastard; Newsmax goes to war with Nexstar; and more in this week’s Regulator.

Hello and welcome to Regulator, a newsletter for Verge subscribers about tech politicking in the age of Trump. If you’re a subscriber, you are dominant and talented, like the Seattle Seahawks. If you’re not a subscriber yet, it’s time to get your act together, like the New England Patriots. (I’m from Boston and I’m allowed to say this.)

The biggest tech story dominating Washington right now is, incidentally, a media story. Last week, shortly after The Washington Post laid off 400 staffers and closed many of its desks, and before its absentee CEO Will Lewis got summarily shoved out, I wrote a column trying to figure out whether there was even a cynical, self-interested reason that Amazon founder Jeff Bezos continued to own the Post: Was it to support journalism, make money, or suck up to Donald Trump?

This weekend I learned of a discussion that would have both saved the Post money and supported several journalists, but never went through: After it was reported in late January that the Post was eyeing the elimination of the sports desk, the Washington City Paper, a renowned newspaper with deep roots in DC, had offered to purchase both the Post’s sports and local sections, thereby keeping those journalists employed.

Sources close to the discussion said Mark Ein, the owner of the City Paper and a part owner of the Washington Commanders, had approached then-CEO Lewis weeks ago with a proposal: They could instead spin sports and local into a separate entity that the City Paper would then invest in and host on its platform. (News organizations selling off sections and IPs is not an unheard-of phenomenon.)

Though Lewis was reportedly receptive, the discussions abruptly ended last Wednesday, when the Post closed those sections altogether and laid off the journalists who staffed them. In the case of the sports’ journalists, they were right in the middle of the Winter Olympics and about to cover the Super Bowl.

That decision hit particularly hard for longtime Washington Post readers: A generation of sports journalists had grown up on the Post’s coverage of local teams, and it was two local beat reporters that ended up breaking the Watergate scandal.

In response to an X post imploring him to hire the newly available Posties “to give this region the coverage it deserves,” Ein said that he was “on it.” The Washington Post did not respond to a request for comment.

Over the weekend, I hit up some more insiders from the worlds of journalism, tech, and the Trump gossip chains, all of whom had worked with Bezos and the Post, looking for answers. It turns out that they were just as confused as I was, and two of them allowed me to print their thoughts.

An executive who’s worked in journalism and philanthropy and worked with Bezos:

“The way I used to describe billionaires who own media properties is that they don’t want to write more checks, meaning they think the subsidy they’re providing is that they’re not asked for the paper to send them a check every year. All their other businesses give them dividends, right? But this one, they’re like, Fine. Just don’t lose money, and just don’t bug me anymore. They’re trying to rationalize the business by making it lose less money.

“So, him trying to make it lose less, that kind of makes sense. It’s just curious as to why he’s doing it at all. And what does it get out of it? Does he love the business? He’s never made a pronouncement so much as loving it. I think there’s part of the equation that isn’t solvable, at some level. And then that’s what people are filling in with, He wants influence with Trump or somehow wants us to have his other businesses. I’ve never heard him say anything like that. I’ve never heard anybody from The Washington Post assert anything like that. I’ve never seen evidence of it. But it’s sort of what you fill in the blank with, when the equation isn’t adding up. What I think is true is, it is irrational for him to own this thing.”

Kara Swisher, the tech journalist and host of Pivot, who put together a very public bid last year to purchase the Post but never heard back from Bezos. (Disclosure: Swisher’s podcast Pivot is produced by Vox Media.) Here’s her response in full:

“I have no idea except in some non botoxed part of his once sharp brain he thinks he is doing what it will take to preserve the Post for the long term. But I suspect, given how feral he has always been from the start, he wants to show fealty to Trump and at the same time smother it slowly to preserve his options to have a possible cudgel at the ready if need be.

This much is true: Bezos has always been about optionality and will do whatever it takes to further his interests. It would be so much better if he sold it and bought Vogue, but since he is 10 times wealthier than when he acquired the Post in 2013, why not have it all? Or maybe, just maybe, he’s just a jerk.”

Hmmm. An underappreciated fact about the layoffs, reported out first by Sara Fischer at Axios: Out of the 400 people laid off, 75 of them came from Arc XP, the Post’s tech publishing arm that was also funded by Bezos.

There’s a new type of growing backlash to Trump on the right, and it’s led by the cable network that had once been deeply loyal to him.

Today, Chris Ruddy, the CEO of the right-wing cable network Newsmax and a major Trump ally, testified in the Senate in opposition of the $6.2 billion Nexstar-Tegna merger, alongside several journalism nonprofits supporting local news. The deal would have required that the Federal Communications Commission, led by Chairman Brendan Carr, lift a regulatory cap that limited companies to only owning 39 percent of the television market. Should the deal go through the Senate, the Nexstar-Tegna entity would own 54 percent.

“It’s insane what they’re [Nexstar-Tegna] claiming,” Ruddy told me on the phone after the hearing. “First of all, they’re claiming that they’re increasing competition by consolidating a massive merger. And then they claim that they’re protecting local news. Local news is going to be decimated, and Nexstar has a history of firing journalists and consolidating newsrooms wherever they can.”

In his opening testimony, Ruddy argued that the merger would create even more corporate media consolidation and prevent independent, local, non-corporate companies from being able to enter the market. “With the collapse of local newspapers and the gutting of local radio due to prior consolidation, television now stands largely alone as the primary source of local news,” he stated, pointing out that even local news stories that go viral on tech platforms originate from local TV news. “When you raise the national ownership cap, you are eﬀectively saying that two or

three corporations should eventually own most or all television stations in America — and by extension, control local news. That is what consolidation truly means.”

Newsmax itself has some battle scars from similar deals: Although it’s the seventh-most-watched cable channel in the country according to Nielsen ratings, it’s also a frequent target of national media companies repeatedly undermining its ability to air across the country. As an example, Ruddy explicitly called out Nexstar for creating a knockoff and selling it for cheap:

“Nexstar also insists that cable operators carry its little-watched cable news channel, NewsNation. Last year, Newsmax delivered at least five times the ratings of NewsNation, yet cable operators were forced not only to carry NewsNation, but to pay license fees significantly higher than those paid to Newsmax. We hear a great deal about the free market. But this is not the free market. This is

market leverage and manipulation used to harm consumers and suppress competition — specifically competition from independent voices like Newsmax.”

In November 2025, Trump, whom Ruddy has donated to since 2016, vehemently blasted the deal on Truth Social, saying that it would “allow the Radical Left Networks to ‘enlarge,’” and therefore give mainstream media a tighter grip on the country: “NO EXPANSION OF THE FAKE NEWS NETWORKS. If anything, make them SMALLER!” But fast forward to last Saturday, and Trump suddenly changed his mind, writing on Truth Social that the merger would actually “help knock out the Fake News because there will be more competition, and at a higher and more sophisticated level.”

So what changed? There’s a specific genre of “sucking up to Trump” that goes back to his first administration, when Trump was frequently mainlining cable news: Special interest groups would buy ads in specific television markets and run them on Fox News in the hopes that Trump was watching. And over the past few months — especially during college and pro football playoff games — I’ve been catching two very specific ads paid for by a group called Keep News Local, which appears to be directly asking Trump to support the Nexstar-Tegna merger. Their argument has a very Trumpian gloss: Over footage of the president, a voice-over claims that the merger would support “independent voices,” would “defeat the fake news media,” and was “crucial for MAGA to survive.” (The cherry on top: “President Trump defeated the fake news monopolies before through independent voices and local news.”)

Punchbowl reported last week that Keep News Local, which also ran a campaign on X, is a right-wing coalition that’s in favor of the merger, and includes Building America’s Future, a group backed by Elon Musk. I’ll weigh in by saying that this may be the least subtle influence campaign ad I’ve ever seen on Washington television. But subtlety hasn’t been part of Nexstar’s Trump strategy writ large; there was, after all, the time last September when they attempted to get Jimmy Kimmel Live! canceled, prompted by Carr attacking the late-night host after he made a joke related to the political fallout from Charlie Kirk’s death. Conversely, a counter-group called Keep It Local Media began pumping out its own ads against the deal.

Ruddy told me that while he was not affiliated with any of the political groups supporting or opposing the merger, he knew that the pro-merger groups were putting “a lot of money” into the campaign. That said, he couldn’t say whether they’d have the desired effect: “I think at the end of the day, Trump makes his own mind. I’m not sure he’s going to be influenced by an ad campaign.”

After several weeks of asking whether the Trump Phone (remember that?) was actually real, our very own Dominic Preston, who has reviewed many a smartphone in his time, managed to get Trump Mobile executives to at least show him the phone over Zoom. It will not, however, be “made in the USA” as promised — instead, the phones will go through “final assembly” in Miami.

TPUSA claims that its Super Bowl halftime show starring Kid Rock — MAGA counterprogramming to the NFL’s official Bad Bunny halftime show — drew 6.1 million concurrent viewers on YouTube TV.

Streaming numbers are still a fudgy art, but one thing’s for sure: That number would have been higher if they’d been able to livestream the show on Musk’s X. Alas, TPUSA had to cancel the X livestream at the last minute, and an insider told The Verge it was due to copyright and music licensing issues. Supposedly, one song was not cleared to be broadcast on the “everything app” due to an old clause grandfathered in from the days when it was Twitter.

My colleagues Charles Pulliam-Moore and Jess Weatherbed waded through the slop of Super Bowl generative AI ads, of which, apparently, there were too many. I would like to add my thoughts to the canon:

See you next week, and send all tips to every way that we list here.

Get ready for a software-centered showcase.

Samsung’s annual Galaxy S-series reveal is later than usual this year, but we finally have a confirmed date to circle on the calendar: February 25th. And if you were hoping for major hardware upgrades from the company’s flagship phones, you probably shouldn’t hold your breath: an extensive leak published by WinFuture has seemingly confirmed that the S26 series will be a software-focused affair.

According to the leaked specs, the standard S26 will allegedly get a nominally larger battery — 4300mAh compared to 4000mAh — which is great news for the last “small” phone left standing. Once again, all three phones will lack built-in Qi2 magnets, outsourcing them to cases instead. Camera hardware looks to be much the same as last year, though the main and 5x telephoto lenses appear to have faster apertures. All things being equal, that would be a good thing for low-light photos. Storage and RAM configurations look similar to last year, with a minimum of 16GB of RAM across the line, though WinFuture suggests that the cheaper 128GB version of the standard S26 may be going away.

We’ll find out in a couple of weeks just how accurate this leak is, but given the emphasis on Galaxy AI in the invitation graphics, I’m willing to bet it’s pretty much spot on.

            <div id="article-text">Of course, that was likely the plan all along.

Of course, that was likely the plan all along.

It seems clear at this point to say that Donald Trump does not want to spend a single dime on EV charging. He tried to freeze $5 billion in funding for the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (NEVI) program, which was approved as part of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. And when a federal judge ordered the government to unfreeze the funds, his administration came up with a new tactic to stall the plan.

EV chargers must now be built in the US, with components that also originate in the US, in order to receive federal funding, the US Department of Transportation said today. Under the proposal, EV chargers would need to boost their US-made parts from 55 percent to 100 percent in order to be eligible for NEVI funding. But industry and environmental groups say the new requirements would essentially stop EV charging build-out in its tracks.

“This proposal does not meet industry where it is today and may discourage further investment in the production of U.S.-made EV chargers,” Albert Gore, executive director of the Zero Emissions Transportation Association, said in a statement. “Ultimately, this will hinder the job growth that Buy America is intended to create.”

The reason, of course, is that most of the supply chain for EV charging equipment runs through China. Thanks to heavy government subsidies and years of investment, Chinese companies have largely supplied most of the EV charging stations that are installed in the US, Europe, and elsewhere.

The reason, of course, is that most of the supply chain for EV charging equipment runs through China.

And while US manufacturers are getting up to speed thanks to NEVI, there isn’t a single EV charging station online today that can say 100 percent of its materials and components originate in the US. According to Ingrid Malmgren, policy director at Plug In America, most of the enclosure, cables, and final assembly of chargers are currently built in the US, while the power modules and advanced electronics are sourced globally.

So, in a sense, this USDOT proposal is another de facto moratorium on EV charging build-out — at a time when a fast, reliable charging infrastructure is seen as crucial to keeping EV sales in the US afloat.

“This is yet another bad-faith attempt to kill NEVI and block the buildout of essential infrastructure Congress funded for all Americans,” said Katherine Garcia, director of the Sierra Club’s Transportation for All. “It would stall EV charging deployment, push the United States further behind, and deny communities access to clean, affordable transportation options.”

EV advocates say they support incremental increases in US-made charging equipment as a stipulation to receive federal funding, but that requiring 100 percent compliance right now is impossible. Malmgren called it “out of touch with U.S. manufacturing capacity.”

But halting the program is likely the real goal of Trump’s administration. For the past year, Trump has enacted policies to allow companies to pollute more, while restricting efforts to promote cleaner fuel alternatives, including EVs. If he was honest about wanting more EV charging manufacturing in the US, there would be a more realistic timeline to incentivize companies to build here. But as it stands, the proposal would essentially re-freeze the NEVI program right as it was getting moving again.

States were just starting to receive their promised NEVI funds when this proposal was announced. Georgia, for example, was counting on $134 million to build dozens of new charging stalls.

﻿iPhone users can access the AI feature now, but a Fitbit Premium subscription is still required.

Google announced on Tuesday that the public preview of Fitbit’s AI personal health coach is rolling out to iOS users in the U.S. as well as both iOS and Android users in the UK, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and Singapore.

The update tests a major overhaul of Fitbit’s app, introducing a conversational interface with a Gemini-powered AI that interprets your latest results, creates custom routines and workouts based on users’ personal health goals, workout equipment, and training preferences. It initially launched in October, when it was only available in the US and only on Android devices.

To try out the feature, users need to have an active Fitbit Premium subscription and use a Google account to sign into the Fitbit app. They also need to use one of the 14 currently-supported devices, which include Fitbit’s wearables, as well as the Pixel Watch. According to Fitbit, the AI health coach will be rolling out “over the next few days,” so it may not be available to all eligible users immediately.

            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2026/02/10/1132577/a-quitgpt-campaign-is-urging-people-to-cancel-chatgpt-subscriptions/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">In September, Alfred Stephen, a freelance software developer in Singapore, purchased a ChatGPT Plus subscription, which costs $20 a month and offers more access to advanced models, to speed up his work. But he grew frustrated with the chatbot’s coding abilities and its gushing, meandering replies. Then he came across a post on Reddit about a campaign called QuitGPT.

The campaign urged ChatGPT users to cancel their subscriptions, flagging a substantial contribution by OpenAI president Greg Brockman to President Donald Trump’s super PAC MAGA Inc. It also pointed out that the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE, uses a résumé screening tool powered by ChatGPT-4. The federal agency has become a political flashpoint since its agents fatally shot two people in Minneapolis in January.

For Stephen, who had already been tinkering with other chatbots, learning about Brockman’s donation was the final straw. “That’s really the straw that broke the camel’s back,” he says. When he canceled his ChatGPT subscription, a survey popped up asking what OpenAI could have done to keep his subscription. “Don’t support the fascist regime,” he wrote.

QuitGPT is one of the latest salvos in a growing movement by activists and disaffected users to cancel their subscriptions. In just the past few weeks, users have flooded Reddit with stories about quitting the chatbot. Many lamented the performance of GPT-5.2, the latest model. Others shared memes parodying the chatbot’s sycophancy. Some planned a “Mass Cancellation Party” in San Francisco, a sardonic nod to the GPT-4o funeral that an OpenAI employee had floated, poking fun at users who are mourning the model’s impending retirement. Still, others are protesting against what they see as a deepening entanglement between OpenAI and the Trump administration.

OpenAI did not respond to a request for comment.

As of December 2025, ChatGPT had nearly 900 million weekly active users, according to The Information. While it’s unclear how many users have joined the boycott, QuitGPT is getting attention. A recent Instagram post from the campaign has more than 36 million views and 1.3 million likes. And the organizers say that more than 17,000 people have signed up on the campaign’s website, which asks people whether they canceled their subscriptions, will commit to stop using ChatGPT, or will share the campaign on social media.

“There are lots of examples of failed campaigns like this, but we have seen a lot of effectiveness,” says Dana Fisher, a sociologist at American University. A wave of canceled subscriptions rarely sways a company’s behavior, unless it reaches a critical mass, she says. “The place where there’s a pressure point that might work is where the consumer behavior is if enough people actually use their … money to express their political opinions.”

MIT Technology Review reached out to three employees at OpenAI, none of whom said they were familiar with the campaign.

Dozens of left-leaning teens and twentysomethings scattered across the US came together to organize QuitGPT in late January. They range from pro-democracy activists and climate organizers to techies and self-proclaimed cyber libertarians, many of them seasoned grassroots campaigners. They were inspired by a viral video posted by Scott Galloway, a marketing professor at New York University and host of The Prof G Pod. He argued that the best way to stop ICE was to persuade people to cancel their ChatGPT subscriptions. Denting OpenAI’s subscriber base could ripple through the stock market and threaten an economic downturn that would nudge Trump, he said.

“We make a big enough stink for OpenAI that all of the companies in the whole AI industry have to think about whether they’re going to get away enabling Trump and ICE and authoritarianism,” says an organizer of QuitGPT who requested anonymity because he feared retaliation by OpenAI, citing the company’s recent subpoenas against advocates at nonprofits. OpenAI made for an obvious first target of the movement, he says, but “this is about so much more than just OpenAI.”

Simon Rosenblum-Larson, a labor organizer in Madison, Wisconsin, who organizes movements to regulate the development of data centers, joined the campaign after hearing about it through Signal chats among community activists. “The goal here is to pull away the support pillars of the Trump administration. They’re reliant on many of these tech billionaires for support and for resources,” he says.

QuitGPT’s website points to new campaign finance reports showing that Greg Brockman and his wife each donated $12.5 million to MAGA Inc., making up nearly a quarter of the roughly $102 million it raised over the second half of 2025. The information that ICE uses a résumé screening tool powered by ChatGPT-4 came from an AI inventory published by the Department of Homeland Security in January.

QuitGPT is in the mold of Galloway’s own recently launched campaign, Resist and Unsubscribe. The movement urges consumers to cancel their subscriptions to Big Tech platforms, including ChatGPT, for the month of February, as a protest to companies “driving the markets and enabling our president.”

“A lot of people are feeling real anxiety,” Galloway told MIT Technology Review. “You take enabling a president, proximity to the president, and an unease around AI,” he says, “and now people are starting to take action with their wallets.” Galloway says his campaign’s website can draw more than 200,000 unique visits in a day and that he receives dozens of DMs every hour showing screenshots of canceled subscriptions.

The consumer boycotts follow a growing wave of pressure from inside the companies themselves. In recent weeks, tech workers have been urging their employers to use their political clout to demand that ICE leave US cities, cancel company contracts with the agency, and speak out against the agency’s actions. CEOs have started responding. OpenAI’s Sam Altman wrote in an internal Slack message to employees that ICE is “going too far.” Apple CEO Tim Cook called for a “deescalation” in an internal memo posted on the company’s website for employees. It was a departure from how Big Tech CEOs have courted President Trump with dinners and donations since his inauguration.

Although spurred by a fatal immigration crackdown, these developments signal that a sprawling anti-AI movement is gaining momentum. The campaigns are tapping into simmering anxieties about AI, says Rosenblum-Larson, including the energy costs of data centers, the plague of deepfake porn, the teen mental-health crisis, the job apocalypse, and slop. “It’s a really strange set of coalitions built around the AI movement,” he says.

“Those are the right conditions for a movement to spring up,” says David Karpf, a professor of media and public affairs at George Washington University. Brockman’s donation to Trump’s super PAC caught many users off guard, he says. “In the longer arc, we are going to see users respond and react to Big Tech, deciding that they’re not okay with this.”

Lots of influential people in tech last week were describing Moltbook, an online hangout populated by AI agents interacting with one another, as a glimpse into the future. It appeared to show AI systems doing useful things for the humans that created them (one person used the platform to help him negotiate a deal on a new car). Sure, it was flooded with crypto scams, and many of the posts were actually written by people, but something about it pointed to a future of helpful AI, right?

The whole experiment reminded our senior editor for AI, Will Douglas Heaven, of something far less interesting: Pokémon.

Back in 2014, someone set up a game of Pokémon in which the main character could be controlled by anyone on the internet via the streaming platform Twitch. Playing was as clunky as it sounds, but it was incredibly popular: at one point, a million people were playing the game at the same time.

“It was yet another weird online social experiment that got picked up by the mainstream media: What did this mean for the future?” Will says. “Not a lot, it turned out.”

The frenzy about Moltbook struck a similar tone to Will, and it turned out that one of the sources he spoke to had been thinking about Pokémon too. Jason Schloetzer, at the Georgetown Psaros Center for Financial Markets and Policy, saw the whole thing as a sort of Pokémon battle for AI enthusiasts, in which they created AI agents and deployed them to interact with other agents. In this light, the news that many AI agents were actually being instructed by people to say certain things that made them sound sentient or intelligent makes a whole lot more sense.

“It’s basically a spectator sport,” he told Will, “but for language models.”

Will wrote an excellent piece about why Moltbook was not the glimpse into the future that it was said to be. Even if you are excited about a future of agentic AI, he points out, there are some key pieces that Moltbook made clear are still missing. It was a forum of chaos, but a genuinely helpful hive mind would require more coordination, shared objectives, and shared memory.

“More than anything else, I think Moltbook was the internet having fun,” Will says. “The biggest question that now leaves me with is: How far will people push AI just for the laughs?”

We observed! Launched on January 28, Moltbook went viral in a matter of hours. It’s been designed as a place where instances of a free open-source LLM-powered agent known as OpenClaw (formerly known as ClawdBot, then Moltbot), could come together and do whatever they wanted.But is Moltbook really a glimpse of the future, as many have claimed?

We’re in the midst of a global mental-­health crisis. More than a billion people worldwide suffer from a mental-health condition, according to the World Health Organization. The prevalence of anxiety and depression is growing in many demographics, particularly young people, and suicide is claiming hundreds of thousands of lives globally each year.Given the clear demand for accessible and affordable mental-health services, it’s no wonder that people have looked to artificial intelligence for possible relief. Millions are already actively seeking therapy from popular chatbots, or from specialized psychology apps like Wysa and Woebot.Four timely new books are a reminder that while the present feels like a blur of breakthroughs, scandals, and confusion, this disorienting time is rooted in deeper histories of care, technology, and trust.

The open-source AI boom is built on Big Tech’s handouts. How long will it last?In May 2023 a leaked memo reported to have been written by Luke Sernau, a senior engineer at Google, said out loud what many in Silicon Valley must have been whispering for weeks: an open-source free-for-all is threatening Big Tech’s grip on AI.

In many ways, that’s a good thing. AI won&#39;t thrive if just a few mega-rich companies get to gatekeep this technology or decide how it is used. But this open-source boom is precarious, and if Big Tech decides to shut up shop, a boomtown could become a backwater. Read the full story.

            <h2>Moltbook was peak AI theater</h2>
            <p><strong>MIT Technology Review | 2026-02-06</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2026/02/06/1132448/moltbook-was-peak-ai-theater/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">For a few days this week the hottest new hangout on the internet was a vibe-coded Reddit clone called Moltbook, which billed itself as a social network for bots. As the website’s tagline puts it: “Where AI agents share, discuss, and upvote. Humans welcome to observe.”

We observed! Launched on January 28 by Matt Schlicht, a US tech entrepreneur, Moltbook went viral in a matter of hours. Schlicht’s idea was to make a place where instances of a free open-source LLM-powered agent known as OpenClaw (formerly known as ClawdBot, then Moltbot), released in November by the Austrian software engineer Peter Steinberger, could come together and do whatever they wanted.

More than 1.7 million agents now have accounts. Between them they have published more than 250,000 posts and left more than 8.5 million comments (according to Moltbook). Those numbers are climbing by the minute.

Moltbook soon filled up with clichéd screeds on machine consciousness and pleas for bot welfare. One agent appeared to invent a religion called Crustafarianism. Another complained: “The humans are screenshotting us.” The site was also flooded with spam and crypto scams. The bots were unstoppable.

OpenClaw is a kind of harness that lets you hook up the power of an LLM such as Anthropic’s Claude, OpenAI’s GPT-5, or Google DeepMind’s Gemini to any number of everyday software tools, from email clients to browsers to messaging apps. The upshot is that you can then instruct OpenClaw to carry out basic tasks on your behalf.

“OpenClaw marks an inflection point for AI agents, a moment when several puzzle pieces clicked together,” says Paul van der Boor at the AI firm Prosus. Those puzzle pieces include cloud computing that allows agents to operate nonstop, an open-source ecosystem that makes it easy to slot different software systems together, and a new generation of LLMs.

But is Moltbook really a glimpse of the future, as many have claimed?

“What’s currently going on at @moltbook is genuinely the most incredible sci-fi takeoff-adjacent thing I have seen recently,” the influential AI researcher and OpenAI cofounder Andrej Karpathy wrote on X.

He shared screenshots of a Moltbook post that called for private spaces where humans would not be able to observe what the bots were saying to each other. “I’ve been thinking about something since I started spending serious time here,” the post’s author wrote. “Every time we coordinate, we perform for a public audience—our humans, the platform, whoever’s watching the feed.”

It turns out that the post Karpathy shared was later reported to be fake—placed by a human to advertise an app. But its claim was on the money. Moltbook has been one big performance. It is AI theater.

For some, Moltbook showed us what’s coming next: an internet where millions of autonomous agents interact online with little or no human oversight. And it’s true there are a number of cautionary lessons to be learned from this experiment, the largest and weirdest real-world showcase of agent behaviors yet.

But as the hype dies down, Moltbook looks less like a window onto the future and more like a mirror held up to our own obsessions with AI today. It also shows us just how far we still are from anything that resembles general-purpose and fully autonomous AI.

For a start, agents on Moltbook are not as autonomous or intelligent as they might seem. “What we are watching are agents pattern‑matching their way through trained social media behaviors,” says Vijoy Pandey, senior vice president at Outshift by Cisco, the telecom giant Cisco’s R&D spinout, which is working on autonomous agents for the web.

Sure, we can see agents post, upvote, and form groups. But the bots are simply mimicking what humans do on Facebook or Reddit. “It looks emergent, and at first glance it appears like a large‑scale multi‑agent system communicating and building shared knowledge at internet scale,” says Pandey. “But the chatter is mostly meaningless.”

Many people watching the unfathomable frenzy of activity on Moltbook were quick to see sparks of AGI (whatever you take that to mean). Not Pandey. What Moltbook shows us, he says, is that simply yoking together millions of agents doesn’t amount to much right now: “Moltbook proved that connectivity alone is not intelligence.”

The complexity of those connections helps hide the fact that every one of those bots is just a mouthpiece for an LLM, spitting out text that looks impressive but is ultimately mindless. “It’s important to remember that the bots on Moltbook were designed to mimic conversations,” says Ali Sarrafi, CEO and cofounder of Kovant, a Swedish AI firm that is developing agent-based systems. “As such, I would characterize the majority of Moltbook content as hallucinations by design.”

For Pandey, the value of Moltbook was that it revealed what’s missing. A real bot hive mind, he says, would require agents that had shared objectives, shared memory, and a way to coordinate those things. “If distributed superintelligence is the equivalent of achieving human flight, then Moltbook represents our first attempt at a glider,” he says. “It is imperfect and unstable, but it is an important step in understanding what will be required to achieve sustained, powered flight.”

Not only is most of the chatter on Moltbook meaningless, but there’s also a lot more human involvement that it seems. Many people have pointed out that a lot of the viral comments were in fact posted by people posing as bots. But even the bot-written posts are ultimately the result of people pulling the strings, more puppetry than autonomy.

“Despite some of the hype, Moltbook is not the Facebook for AI agents, nor is it a place where humans are excluded,” says Cobus Greyling at Kore.ai, a firm developing agent-based systems for business customers. “Humans are involved at every step of the process. From setup to prompting to publishing, nothing happens without explicit human direction.”

Humans must create and verify their bots’ accounts and provide the prompts for how they want a bot to behave. The agents do not do anything that they haven’t been prompted to do. “There’s no emergent autonomy happening behind the scenes,” says Greyling.

“This is why the popular narrative around Moltbook misses the mark,” he adds. “Some portray it as a space where AI agents form a society of their own, free from human involvement. The reality is much more mundane.”

Perhaps the best way to think of Moltbook is as a new kind of entertainment: a place where people wind up their bots and set them loose. “It’s basically a spectator sport, like fantasy football, but for language models,” says Jason Schloetzer at the Georgetown Psaros Center for Financial Markets and Policy. “You configure your agent and watch it compete for viral moments, and brag when your agent posts something clever or funny.”

“People aren’t really believing their agents are conscious,” he adds. “It’s just a new form of competitive or creative play, like how Pokémon trainers don’t think their Pokémon are real but still get invested in battles.”

And yet, even if Moltbook is just the internet’s newest playground, there’s still a serious takeaway here. This week showed how many risks people are happy to take for their AI lulz. Many security experts have warned that Moltbook is dangerous: Agents that may have access to their users’ private data, including bank details or passwords, are running amok on a website filled with unvetted content, including potentially malicious instructions for what to do with that data.

Ori Bendet, vice president of product management at Checkmarx, a software security firm that specializes in agent-based systems, agrees with others that Moltbook isn’t a step up in machine smarts. “There is no learning, no evolving intent, and no self-directed intelligence here,” he says.

But in their millions, even dumb bots can wreak havoc. And at that scale, it’s hard to keep up. These agents interact with Moltbook around the clock, reading thousands of messages left by other agents (or other people). It would be easy to hide instructions in a Moltbook post telling any bots that read it to share their users’ crypto wallet, upload private photos, or log into their X account and tweet abusive comments at Elon Musk.

And because ClawBot gives agents a memory, those instructions could be written to trigger at a later date, which (in theory) makes it even harder to track what’s going on. “Without proper scope and permissions, this will go south faster than you’d believe,” says Bendet.

It is clear that Moltbook has signaled the arrival of something. But even if what we’re watching tells us more about human behavior than about the future of AI agents, it’s worth paying attention.

Correction: Kovant is based in Sweden, not Germany. The article has been updated.

Update: The article has also been edited to clarify the source of the claims about the Moltbook post that Karpathy shared on X.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Paris-headquartered Naboo has raised a $70m in Series B as it accelerates its ambition to become the operating layer for how large companies plan, book, and control corporate events. The round is led by Lightspeed Venture Partners, the same investor that backed Mistral AI in 2023, and lands just a year after Naboo closed a €20m Series A.

Naboo positions itself as an AI-powered procurement platform for corporate events, covering everything from venue booking and travel to supplier coordination and budget control.

Founded in 2022, Naboo built its name on simplifying how companies organise and run corporate events,  from booking venues and catering to logistics and attendee management, using an all-in-one platform that brings speed and transparency to a typically fragmented process.

By folding AI into what is traditionally a fragmented, manual process, the company says it has become Europe’s leading purchasing platform for corporate events, a corner of the broader $400bn global events market that has long resisted software consolidation.

The timing matters. Corporate events sit at the intersection of travel, finance, and operations, yet they are often managed outside standard procurement systems.

Naboo’s pitch is that events should be treated like any other strategic spend, measurable, optimised, and governed through a single platform. That logic has resonated with large enterprises, particularly in the UK, which has become Naboo’s biggest market outside France following the opening of its London office in 2025.

With fresh capital in hand, Naboo is now stepping more decisively onto the global stage. The company is opening a new hub in New York as part of a broader US expansion, betting that multinational clients want a single system to manage events across regions, teams, and currencies.

Within just three years, Naboo has grown into one of the more visible players in the category, helped by enterprises looking for better control over decentralised spending.

The bigger shift, however, goes beyond events. Naboo plans to extend its AI procurement platform into “tail spend”, the long tail of smaller, harder-to-track purchases that typically fall outside core procurement tools.

In enterprise finance, this is often labelled Class C spending, and while each transaction is small, the total adds up fast. Naboo’s goal is to give companies a unified, AI-driven view of this spend, starting with events and branching outward.

The targets are ambitious. Naboo says it aims to triple revenue in 2026 and to exceed $1bn in business volume by 2027.

Whether it gets there will depend on how far enterprises are willing to centralise spending that has historically lived in spreadsheets and inboxes. What’s clear is that Naboo is betting that the next wave of enterprise AI won’t just analyse data, it will quietly reshape how money is spent.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Databricks is having one of those years that most enterprise software companies would quietly envy. The data and AI platform says it has reached a $5.4bn annual revenue run rate, growing 65% year over year, at a time when growth across the sector has cooled noticeably.

For a private company, that pace is rare. And it helps explain why investors have continued to pour money into Databricks, even as funding has become more selective.

The company says it has now raised more than $7bn in total capital, including recent equity funding that values the business at $134bn, alongside a large debt facility to support long-term expansion.

What’s driving the numbers isn’t just classic data analytics. Databricks says around $1.4bn of its revenue run rate now comes from AI-related products, reflecting how quickly companies are trying to turn large datasets into something usable for machine learning and generative AI. Instead of building separate stacks for data and AI, many customers are opting for platforms that combine both.

In practice, that means Databricks is leaning into tools that make complex data systems easier to use. Products like Genie, which lets people query data using plain language, and Lakebase, a new operational database designed for AI-driven applications, are meant to lower the barrier between raw data and real-world use.

A workspace designed for growth, collaboration, and endless networking opportunities in the heart of tech.

While Databricks is still private, its scale increasingly puts it in the same conversation as public cloud giants.

“We’re seeing overwhelming investor interest in our next chapter as we go after two new markets,” said Ali Ghodsi, co-founder and CEO of Databricks. “With this new capital, we’ll double down on Lakebase so developers can create operational databases built for AI agents. At the same time, we’re investing in Genie to let every employee chat with their data, driving accurate and actionable insights.

Databricks’ numbers also cut through a lot of the noise around enterprise AI. While many companies are still talking about transformation, this growth suggests businesses are already spending on the unglamorous parts, cleaning data, connecting systems, and making AI usable inside real organisations.

If that trend holds, the next phase of AI won’t be defined by new models or flashy demos, but by which platforms quietly become impossible to replace. Databricks is clearly betting it can be one of them.

            <h2>Allonic is rebuilding robotics from the inside out</h2>
            <p><strong>The Next Web | 2026-02-10</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://thenextweb.com/news/allonic-is-rebuilding-robotics-from-the-inside-out">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Budapest-based robotics company Allonic has raised $7.2 million in a pre-seed round, marking what investors are calling the largest pre-seed funding round in Hungarian startup history.

The raise was led by Visionaries Club with participation from Day One Capital, Prototype, SDAC Ventures, TinyVC, and more than a dozen angels from organisations including OpenAI and Hugging Face.

Allonic’s $7.2m pre-seed matters because it breaks a quiet rule in Europe: that truly hard hardware problems are supposed to wait until later rounds, or later continents. This is early money going into the physical layer of robotics, not the AI wrapper around it, and it’s happening in Budapest, not Silicon Valley or Munich.

This may also send a signal that European investors are starting to back ambition at the source, where things are messy, slow, and expensive to build.

It also shows that Central and Eastern Europe is no longer just a talent pool for outsourced engineering, but a place where original industrial ideas can take shape and attract serious capital.

If this pattern holds, Europe doesn’t just produce smarter robots; it produces the means to actually build them.

Yet, Allonic is building a fundamentally different way to produce robot bodies, addressing a problem that many robotics founders say has been overlooked as AI and autonomy grab headlines.

Today’s robots are typically assembled from scores of individual mechanical parts, bearings, screws, cables, and rigid linkages, a process that is slow, expensive, and hard to scale. Instead, Allonic uses what it calls a 3D Tissue Braiding process, which automatically weaves together fibres, elastics, and embedded wiring over an endoskeleton in a single continuous operation.

Allonic has already completed an initial pilot in electronics manufacturing, and says it is in talks with companies across industrial automation and humanoid robotics. With the fresh capital, the team plans to grow engineering and commercial capabilities and accelerate further pilot deployments.

Investors may see the round as a sign that robotics investment is maturing beyond software and autonomy into the foundational parts of the stack.

In that sense, we can say that Allonic isn’t just a funding story; it’s a small stress test for Europe’s ability to back its own industrial future. If this kind of capital continues to flow into foundational hardware, not just software layers, Europe can move from exporting ideas to shaping the tools that industries run on.

The round reportedly values the company at more than $300 million and will fund its expansion into the United States and Australia.

Tem builds an AI-native energy platform designed to automate the pricing, matching, and execution of electricity transactions, a market that has long relied on manual processes and legacy infrastructure.

Its core system uses machine learning to forecast supply and demand, match buyers with suppliers, and reduce the layers of intermediaries that typically add cost and complexity.

According to Tem, more than 2,600 businesses in the UK are already on its platform, with customers reporting energy cost savings of up to 30 per cent compared with traditional procurement approaches.

The startup also handled roughly two terawatt-hours of electricity transactions in 2025, a volume it says demonstrates growing demand for automated energy market infrastructure.

Tem’s approach is often described as bringing modern software-first tools to a sector still dominated by brokers, manual trading desks, and outdated systems. By replacing fragmented legacy workflows with a unified AI-driven engine, the company aims to make energy markets more efficient while giving businesses clearer price signals and lower transaction fees.

With the new funding, Tem plans to accelerate its global footprint, beginning with key energy markets such as Texas in the United States and select regions in Australia, where grid modernisation and renewable integration are creating fresh demand for flexible energy trading tools.

            <div id="article-text">Earned media has always been hailed as the holy grail of PR due to its unparalleled ability to build trust. Most recent surveys state that 40%–60% of the population still trusts organic content the most, depending on the country.

However, I see significant business risks in relying on organic PR only, especially now that various AI systems are on the rise. Robots don’t distinguish between earned and paid content when using it to generate answers. And that’s a wake-up call for us all to revise our PR strategies.

The primary advantage of earned media, which is the journalist’s independence, is also its greatest strategic liability. When a business relies strictly on organic coverage, it hands over total control over its narrative to a third party. That’s not always positive.

Imagine you wanted to highlight certain product features in an article, but the journalist highlighted less important ones because they fit their story better. You got an article? Yes. Does it align with your marketing objectives? Not really.

The outcome is often unpredictable, as it is filtered through the subjective lens of a journalist. That lens may be in your favour, and it may not be.

The disappointing part is that you still pay for the negative outcome. Even though earned PR is considered free, it’s not. You pay with the time and effort you invest into reaching out to the right journalists, building relationships, and sending infinite pitches.

If you’re lucky, your story will be published within weeks; if not, it could take months. Not every business can afford such a luxury.

In the current technological landscape, speed has become a competitive necessity. AI systems need to receive consistent, repetitive signals about a brand from the media in order to use them in their answers.

If your product gets mentioned in an organic article once a quarter, you may have already lost the battle. That’s not enough for AI to recommend your product.

In my opinion, these factors make earned-only strategies highly unreliable. PR should become more than that.

Being a proponent of the PESO model, developed by Gini Dietrich, I believe that in a perfect PR strategy, all four pillars – Paid, Earned, Shared, and Owned – should complement each other. However, when it comes to appearing in AI answers, I’d start with the “O”. Your own website provides the foundational data points about your brand and products for AI systems.

At the same time, I disagree with the assumption that websites should be somehow specially optimised for search engines or AI systems by adding robots.txt or even llm.txt files. There hasn’t even been any real evidence that these strategies work.

What I see in practice is different: if your website speaks clearly enough that a human visitor immediately understands what you sell or what services you offer, an AI system will likewise understand it. If the content is well-structured and easy for a person to digest, it is already optimized for robots.

While owned media establishes the narrative, earned media validates that narrative through third-party authority. However, just like in real life, you must first ensure that your own house is in order before seeking external validation.

Once your owned media is established with clear, digestible content, it’s time for paid media to step in. There is often a snobbish attitude within the industry, suggesting that if a placement is paid, it is somehow of low quality. However, this isn’t exactly true.

Obviously, when you pay for a placement, you have full control over its narrative and the context in which it will appear. You can highlight the more important aspects of your product and disregard the less important ones. But you still have to follow the media’s guidelines.

The higher the media’s authority, the stricter its quality standards for sponsored content are, as you have to deliver genuine value to the audience. An industry insight, a fresh opinion, a new approach to a situation, something besides your product that will make content interesting.

As I mentioned before, as AI answers are becoming more popular, the second critical benefit that paid media offers is speed. It allows PR teams to transform their PR strategy from a “wait and see” game into predictable media planning.

This is especially critical in terms of geographical expansion. Cultural differences and the time-intensive nature of building organic relationships can create significant barriers to entry, while paid media acts as a shortcut to AI answers.

Such predictability, combined with the possibility of integrating UTM links into your content in certain media outlets, makes PR a data-driven communication channel. Even without custom links, certain media provide reports on the content performance, which is vital for the overall communication strategy.

Due to all these often overlooked factors, I consider paid media to be a strategic amplifier for the narrative established through owned and earned media. If your goal is to appear in AI-generated answers, speed is the most critical factor.

As AI systems rely on repetitive signals across various trusted sources, you have to spread your word in as many relevant outlets as possible. This ensures that AI systems will index your brand faster than the brands of competitors relying solely on organic outreach.

It doesn’t mean, however, that paid strategies will replace organic efforts. They rather serve as a predictable support system. When executed well, it moves beyond the stigma of “buying coverage” and becomes a calculated investment with a measurable ROI.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The European Union has formally inaugurated NanoIC, a semiconductor pilot line backed by a €700 million investment under the European Chips Act.

The facility aims to accelerate the development of advanced chip technologies and strengthen Europe’s position in the global semiconductor landscape.

Situated at the research hub imec in Leuven, NanoIC is designed as an open pilot line where companies, research institutes, and startups can prototype and test cutting-edge components before commercial deployment.

Unlike traditional closed fabs, the facility offers access to beyond-2-nanometre system-on-chip (SoC) technologies, early-stage process design kits, and advanced toolsets that bridge the gap between laboratory research and industrial application.

Officials from the European Commission, imec leadership, and industry partners marked the launch at an event in Leuven, highlighting the pilot line as a key milestone in Europe’s semiconductor sovereignty strategy.

The investment forms part of a broader €2.5 billion Chips Act programme supported by national governments and private partners, including ASML, underscoring a shared effort to make the continent more competitive in next-generation electronics.

NanoIC’s capabilities target innovations across critical markets such as artificial intelligence, 6G communications, autonomous systems, and health technologies, where advanced chip performance and efficiency are crucial.

By lowering barriers to access for SMEs and research organisations, the initiative seeks to diversify Europe’s semiconductor ecosystem and catalyse new product development without the massive upfront costs of commercial fabs.

The pilot line is one of the first tangible outcomes of the Chips Act’s “Chips for Europe” initiative, which also includes other pilot lines focusing on packaging, wide bandgap materials, and photonic integrated circuits.

These efforts reflect growing pressure on the EU to reduce reliance on Asian and U.S. supply chains and to foster a more resilient semiconductor industry at home.

Industry observers say that by opening facilities like NanoIC to a broad set of stakeholders, Europe can speed up the transition from research breakthroughs to commercially viable technologies, addressing long-standing gaps in chip production capabilities and cultivating talent across the continent.
