            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Jay Bhattacharya, director of the National Institutes of Health under the Trump administration, appeared before the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions (HELP) Tuesday. In the wide-ranging hearing, Bhattacharya defended the chaotic and disruptive cuts at the institutes he helms while carefully wording responses related to vaccines—seemingly to avoid contradicting his boss, anti-vaccine Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

As Bhattacharya testified, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), the HELP committee’s ranking member, released a report outlining the state of the NIH. The report concluded that the Trump administration is “failing American patients,” and “destroying medical research through cuts to research grants, terminations of clinical trials, and the chaos it has created.”

Since Trump took office, the NIH has terminated or frozen hundreds of millions of dollars for research grants, including $561 million in grants to research the four leading causes of death in America, the report found.

Specifically, Bhattacharya oversaw the disruption of: 116 grants for cancer research, totaling $273 million; 71 grants to study heart disease, totaling $111 million; 65 grants for Alzheimer’s disease, totaling $94 million; and 68 grants for diabetes, totaling $83 million. The report also identified at least 304 clinical trials that were defunded, including 69 that were for children.

In the hearing on Tuesday, senators repeatedly brought up the grant and trial cuts, emphasizing that they are disrupting, if not ending, research that could lead to biomedical advances. Senators relayed reports of scientists scaling back their lab work and some being unable to pay their graduate students. Early career scientists are looking to move abroad—while China and Europe are actively recruiting top scientific talent. Meanwhile, patients, some with dire medical conditions, have been abruptly dropped from potentially lifesaving clinical trials.

Bhattacharya was dismissive of all these concerns. “We didn’t cut any funding,” he claimed. “The United States remains the single best place in the world to do biomedical research.”

But at other points in the hearing, he acknowledged some cuts, arguing that although grants and trials were terminated, some had been restored. “The estimates I’m hearing from my folks is that ultimately it was only a dozen or so trials that were actually terminated. Almost every single other one of them we’ve refocused, removed to depoliticize them and focus them on the actual science.”

He did not explain how studies were “depoliticized,” but the Senate report noted that the NIH issued a “Staff Guidance” that all funded research be scanned for words that may not align with the Trump administration’s ideology. The lengthy list (provided with the Senate report) includes words such as “diversity,” “climate change,” “gender,” and “ethnic.”

Sen. Angela Alsobrooks (D-Md.) pointed out that some of the funding was only restored as a result of a lawsuit. “So, let’s be honest about that,” Alsobrooks said. “Some of these… the courts had to force.”

Sen. Maggie Hassan (D-N.H.) pushed Bhattacharya on the impact the cuts had on patients, asking specifically if there were any plans to study the effects on cancer patients. Bhattacharya responded, saying that there shouldn’t have been any effects because he had ordered continuity of care for any disrupted trials. “If there were disruptions, then it is the responsibility of the researchers that were managing the patients, not the NIH,” he said.

“That is really an unacceptable and outrageous response,” Hassan responded. “You all disrupted funding. You can make an edict from Washington, DC: ‘Oh, don’t disrupt continuity of care.’ But that can be a very complicated thing and I know that in my state, there were disruptions in these studies that have really put patients at risk.”

Senators also pressed the director on the future of the NIH, noting that it has been hamstrung by the ongoing chaos, putting upcoming grant funding at risk, too. Of the NIH’s 27 institutes and centers, Bhattacharya testified, “I think it’s 15″ that are without a director. Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.), meanwhile, noted that more than half of the institutes are on track to lose all their voting advisory committee members by the end of the year—and grants cannot be approved without sign-off from these committees. Bhattacharya responded that they’re working on it.

In the course of the hearing, senators also tried to assess Bhattacharya’s loyalty to Kennedy’s dangerous anti-vaccine ideology, which includes the false and thoroughly debunked claim that vaccines cause autism.

Sanders asked Bhattacharya directly: “Do vaccines cause autism? Yes/no?”

“I do not believe that the measles vaccine causes autism,” Bhattacharya responded.

“No, uh-uh,” Sanders quickly interjected. “I didn’t ask [about] measles. Do vaccines cause autism?”

“I have not seen a study that suggests any single vaccine causes autism,” Bhattacharya responded.

But this, too, is an evasive answer. Note that he said “any single vaccine,” leaving open the possibility that he believes vaccines collectively or in some combination could cause autism. The measles vaccine, for instance, is given in combination with immunizations against mumps, rubella, and sometimes varicella (chickenpox).

It would also be false to suggest vaccines in combination are linked to autism; numerous studies have found no link between autism and vaccination generally. Still, this is a false idea that Kennedy and the like-minded anti-vaccine advocates he has installed into critical federal vaccine advisory roles are now pursuing.

Later in the hearing, Bhattacharya also indicated that when he said “I have not seen a study,” he was suggesting that it was because such studies have not been done—which is also false; routine childhood vaccines have been extensively studied for safety and efficacy.

“I’ve seen so many studies on measles vaccines and autism that established that there is no link,” [to autism], he said in an exchange with Hassan on the subject. “The other vaccines are less well studied.”</div>

            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-02-04</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2026/02/capture-it-all-ice-urged-to-explain-memo-about-collecting-info-on-protesters/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Senator Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.) demanded that Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) confirm or deny the existence of a “domestic terrorists” database that lists US citizens who protest ICE’s immigration crackdown.

ICE “officers and senior Trump administration officials have repeatedly suggested that the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is building a ‘domestic terrorists’ database comprising information on US citizens protesting ICE’s actions in recent weeks,” Markey wrote in a letter yesterday to Acting ICE Director Todd Lyons. “If such a database exists, it would constitute a grave and unacceptable constitutional violation. I urge you to immediately confirm or deny the existence of such a database, and if it exists, immediately shut it down and delete it.”

Creating a database of peaceful protesters “would constitute a shocking violation of the First Amendment and abuse of power,” and amount to “the kinds of tactics the United States rightly condemns in authoritarian governments such as China and Russia,” Markey said.

Markey’s letter said DHS officials “have repeatedly stated that the agency is engaged in efforts to monitor, catalog, and intimidate individuals engaged in peaceful protests,” and gave several examples. Trump border czar Tom Homan recently told Laura Ingraham on Fox News, “One thing I’m pushing for right now, Laura, we’re going to create a database where those people that are arrested for interference, impeding, and assault, we’re going to make them famous. We’re going to put their face on TV. We’re going to let their employers, and their neighborhoods, and their schools know who these people are.”

Markey’s letter called Homan’s comment “especially alarming given the numerous incidents in which DHS appears to have concluded that protesting ICE itself constitutes grounds for arrest.” Markey pointed to another recent incident in Portland, Maine, in which a masked ICE agent told an observer who was taking video that “we have a nice little database and now you’re considered a domestic terrorist.”

Markey’s letter cited a CNN report that said a memo sent to ICE agents in Minneapolis told them to “capture all images, license plates, identifications, and general information on hotels, agitators, protestors, etc., so we can capture it all in one consolidated form.” Markey’s letter said the “directive appears to encourage the broad collection of personal information about individuals engaged in protest activity, without any indication of criminal wrongdoing or any other legal justification.”

Markey asked Lyons for details on the database, if it exists, or details on any plans to create such a database, and a description of “the legal authority for its creation, and all categories of information collected.” Markey wants a copy of the memo to ICE agents and any similar “directives instructing agents to collect personal information about protesters, bystanders, or individuals filming ICE activity.”

Markey asked whether the agent in the Maine incident is being investigated or facing disciplinary action. “What steps is DHS taking to ensure that its agents do not intimidate or retaliate against individuals engaged in First Amendment-protected activity, including protests?” the letter asked.

We contacted ICE about Markey’s letter and will update this article if it provides a comment.

An ICE observer in Minnesota recently said in a court filing that her Global Entry and TSA PreCheck privileges were revoked three days after an incident in which an agent scanned her face. Markey’s office said today he is planning to propose legislation to ban ICE’s use of facial recognition technology.</div>

            <h2>User blowback convinces Adobe to keep supporting 30-year-old 2D animation app</h2>
            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-02-04</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2026/02/adobe-reverses-decision-to-discontinue-animate-after-a-lot-of-confusion-and-angst/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Adobe has canceled plans to discontinue its 2D animation software Animate.

On Monday, Adobe announced that it would stop allowing people to sell subscriptions to Animate on March 1, saying the software had “served its purpose.” People who already had a software license would be able to keep using Animate with technical support until March 1, 2027; businesses had until March 1, 2029. Per an email sent to customers, Adobe also said users would lose access to Animate files and project data on March 1, 2027. Animate costs $23 per month.

After receiving backlash from animators and other users, Adobe reversed its decision on Tuesday night. In an announcement posted online, the San Jose, California-headquartered company said:

We are not discontinuing or removing access to Adobe Animate. Animate will continue to be available for both current and new customers, and we will ensure you continue to have access to your content. There is no longer a deadline or date by which Animate will no longer be available.

Adobe said the software will be available for individuals and businesses and will still receive technical support and security and bug fixes, but not new features.

The company said its Monday announcement “did not meet our standards and caused a lot of confusion and angst.”

“We are committed to ensuring Animate users have access to their content regardless if the state of development changes,” Adobe said.

Mike Chambers, a community director at Adobe, affirmed via Reddit that Adobe has no plans to shut down Animate. If the company decides to discontinue the software, it “will work closely with the community to ensure they have adequate time to plan in order to minimize disruption and will take steps so that the community continues to have long-term access to their content,” he said.

Animate debuted in 1996 as FutureWave Software’s FutureSplash Animator. After a 1997 acquisition by Macromedia, FutureSplash Animator became Macromedia Flash. In 2005, Adobe bought Macromedia and renamed Macromedia Flash to Adobe Flash Professional. In 2015, the software became Adobe Animate CC. In its nearly 30 years of use, Animate has been used in numerous popular animated films and shows, including Star Trek: Lower Decks. Still, Adobe said on Monday that “new platforms and paradigms have emerged that better serve the needs of the user.”

Based on the response to Monday’s announcement, not everyone agrees that Animate is obsolete. Adobe’s announcement has also drawn increased scrutiny because of the company’s growing focus on AI-based tools, which have led to higher subscription fees.

“Shutting down Animate and cutting off users from decades worth of work, while simultaneously focusing on anti-artist AI technology, is incredibly disrespectful to your users. Make the software open-source if you’re not going to do the work yourself,” a user on Adobe’s forum going by “FFFlay” wrote in response to Monday’s announcement.

Although Adobe has shown an ability to respond to customer frustration and will allow people to use Animate for the foreseeable future, people who depend on the software, including for animation and education, are concerned about relying on a program that Adobe almost discontinued.

In a post today, an Adobe community member going by the username rayek.elfin wrote, “The damage is done in my opinion. The news of Adobe discontinuing Animate went viral and probably created so much anxiety and uncertainty that studios and indie animators are already looking to replace Animate in their pipelines.”

When asked how Adobe will try to rebuild trust among users, Chambers said, “Trust doesn’t come beforehand, it comes after (and has to be earned). We say what we will do, and if we consistently do it, we gain trust. We are at the ‘we say what we will do’ part for a lot of people.”</div>

            <h2>Russian spy satellites have intercepted EU communications satellites</h2>
            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-02-04</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2026/02/russian-spy-satellites-have-intercepted-eu-communications-satellites/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">European security officials believe two Russian space vehicles have intercepted the communications of at least a dozen key satellites over the continent.

Officials believe that the likely interceptions, which have not previously been reported, risk not only compromising sensitive information transmitted by the satellites but could also allow Moscow to manipulate their trajectories or even crash them.

Russian space vehicles have shadowed European satellites more intensively over the past three years, at a time of high tension between the Kremlin and the West following Moscow’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine.

For several years, military and civilian space authorities in the West have been tracking the activities of Luch-1 and Luch-2—two Russian objects that have carried out repeated suspicious maneuvers in orbit.

Both vehicles have made risky close approaches to some of Europe’s most important geostationary satellites, which operate high above the Earth and service the continent, including the UK, as well as large parts of Africa and the Middle East.

According to orbital data and ground-based telescopic observations, they have lingered nearby for weeks at a time, particularly over the past three years. Since its launch in 2023, Luch-2 has approached 17 European satellites.

Both satellites are suspected of “doing sigint [signals intelligence] business,” Major General Michael Traut, head of the German military’s space command, told the Financial Times, referring to the satellites’ practice of staying close to Western communications satellites.

A senior European intelligence official said the Luch vehicles were almost certainly intended to position themselves within the narrow cone of data beams transmitted from Earth-based stations to the satellites.

The official expressed concern that sensitive information—notably command data for European satellites—is unencrypted, because many were launched years ago without advanced onboard computers or encryption capabilities.

This leaves them vulnerable to future interference—or even destruction—once hostile actors have recorded their command data.

The maneuvers in space come as Russia steps up its “hybrid warfare” in Europe, including sabotage operations such as the severing of subsea Internet and power cables.

Intelligence and military officials are increasingly worried that the Kremlin could extend such disruptive activity into space, and is already developing the capability to do so.

While China and the US have developed similar technologies, Russia has one of the most advanced space-spying programs and has been more aggressive in its use of the vehicles to stalk satellites.

“Satellite networks are an Achilles heel of modern societies. Whoever attacks them can paralyze entire nations,” German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius said in a speech last September.

“The Russian activities are a fundamental threat to all of us, especially in space. A threat we must no longer ignore,” he added.

The European satellites approached by Luch 1 and 2 are primarily used for civilian purposes, such as satellite television, but also carry sensitive government and some military communications.

Luch 1 and Luch 2 are unlikely to have the capability to jam or destroy satellites themselves, the European intelligence official said. However, they have probably provided Russia with large amounts of data on how such systems could be disrupted, both from the ground and in orbit.

Maj. Gen. Traut said he presumed the Luch satellites had intercepted the “command link” of the satellites they approached—the channel linking satellites to ground controllers that allows orbital adjustments.

Analysts say that with such information, Russia could mimic ground operators, beaming false commands to satellites to manipulate their thrusters used for minor orbital adjustments.

Those thrusters could also be used to knock satellites out of alignment or even cause them to crash back to Earth or drift into space.

Intelligence gathered by Luch 1 and 2 could also help Russia coordinate less overt attacks on Western interests. Monitoring other satellites can reveal who is using them and where—information that could later be exploited for targeted ground-based jamming or hacking operations.

The Luch vehicles were “maneuvring about and parking themselves close to geostationary satellites, often for many months at a time,” said Belinda Marchand, chief science officer at Slingshot Aerospace, a US-based company that tracks objects in space using ground-based sensors and artificial intelligence.

She added that Luch 2 was currently “in proximity” to Intelsat 39, a large geostationary satellite that services Europe and Africa.

Since its launch in 2023, Luch-2 has hovered near at least 17 other geostationary satellites above Europe serving both commercial and government purposes, Slingshot data shows.

“They have visited the same families, the same operators—so you can deduce that they have a specific purpose or interest,” said Norbert Pouzin, senior orbital analyst at Aldoria, a French satellite tracking company that has also shadowed the Luch satellites. “These are all Nato-based operators.”

“Even if they cannot decrypt messages, they can still extract a lot of information… they can map how a satellite is being used, work out the location of ground terminals, for example,” he added.

Pouzin also said that Russia now seemed to be ramping up its reconnaissance activity in space, launching two new satellites last year named Cosmos 2589 and Cosmos 2590. The vehicles appear to have similarly maneuvrable capabilities to Luch-1 and Luch-2.

Cosmos 2589 is now on its way to the same range as geostationary satellites, which orbit 35,000 km above Earth, Pouzin said.

But Luch-1 may no longer be functional. On January 30, Earth telescopes observed what appeared to be a plume of gas coming from the satellite. Shortly after, it appeared to at least partially fragment.

“It looks like it began with something to do with the propulsion,” said Marchand, adding that afterwards there “was certainly a fragmentation,” and the satellite was “still tumbling.”

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The Space Launch System rocket program is now a decade and a half old, and it continues to be dominated by two unfortunate traits: It is expensive, and it is slow.

The massive rocket and its convoluted ground systems, so necessary to baby and cajole the booster’s prickly hydrogen propellant on board, have cost US taxpayers in excess of $30 billion to date. And even as it reaches maturity, the rocket is going nowhere fast.

You remember the last time NASA tried to launch the world’s largest orange rocket, right? The space agency rolled the Space Launch System out of its hangar in March 2022. The first, second, and third attempts at a wet dress rehearsal—elaborate fueling tests—were scrubbed. The SLS rocket was slowly rolled back to its hangar for work in April before returning to the pad in June.

The fourth fueling test also ended early but this time reached to within 29 seconds of when the engines would ignite. This was not all the way to the planned T-9.3 seconds, a previously established gate to launch the vehicle. Nevertheless mission managers had evidently had enough of failed fueling tests. Accordingly, they proceeded into final launch preparations.

The first launch attempt (effectively the fifth wet-dress test), in late August, was scrubbed due to hydrogen leaks and other problems. A second attempt, a week later, also succumbed to hydrogen leaks. Finally, on the next attempt, and seventh overall try at fully fueling and nursing this vehicle through a countdown, the Space Launch System rocket actually took off. After doing so, it flew splendidly.

That was November 16, 2022. More than three years ago. You might think that over the course of the extended interval since then, and after the excruciating pain of spending nearly an entire year conducting fueling tests to try to lift the massive rocket off the pad, some of the smartest engineers in the world, the fine men and women at NASA, would have dug into and solved the leak issues.

On Monday, after rolling the SLS rocket to be used for the Artemis II mission to the pad in January, NASA attempted its first wet-dress test with this new vehicle. At one of the main interfaces where liquid hydrogen enters the vehicle, a leak developed, not dissimilar to problems that occurred with the Artemis I rocket three years ago.

NASA has developed several ploys to mitigate the leak. These include varying the rate of hydrogen, which is very cold, flowing into the vehicle. At times they also stopped this flow, hoping the seals at the interface between the ground equipment and the rocket would warm up and “re-seat,” thereby halting the leaks. It worked—sort of. After several hours of troubleshooting, the vehicle was fully loaded. Finally, running about four hours late on their timeline, the dogged countdown team at Kennedy Space Center pushed toward the last stages of the countdown.

However, at this critical time, the liquid hydrogen leak rate spiked once again. This led to an automatic abort of the test a little before T-5 minutes. And so ended NASA’s hopes of launching the much-anticipated Artemis II mission, sending four astronauts around the Moon, in February. NASA will now attempt to launch the vehicle no earlier than March following more wet-dress attempts in the interim.

In a news conference on Tuesday afternoon, NASA officials were asked why they had not solved a problem that was so nettlesome during the Artemis I launch campaign.

“After Artemis I, with the challenges we had with the leaks, we took a pretty aggressive approach to do some component-level testing with some of these valves and the seals, and try to understand their behavior,” said John Honeycutt, chair of the Artemis II Mission Management Team. “And so we got a good handle on that relative to how we install the flight-side and the ground-side interface. But on the ground, we’re pretty limited in how much realism we can put into the test. We try to test like we fly, but this interface is a very complex interface. When you’re dealing with hydrogen, it’s a small molecule. It’s highly energetic. We like it for that reason. And we do the best we can.”

If NASA were really going to do the best it could with this rocket, there were options in the last three years. It is common in commercial rocketry to build one or more “test” tanks to both stress the hardware and ensure its compatibility with ground systems through an extensive test campaign. However, SLS hardware is extraordinarily expensive. A single rocket costs in excess of $2 billion, so the program is hardware-poor. Moreover, tanking tests might have damaged the launch tower, which itself cost more than $1 billion. As far as I know, there was never any serious discussion of building a test tank.

Hardware scarcity, due to cost, is but one of several problems with the SLS rocket architecture. Probably the biggest one is its extremely low flight rate, which makes every fueling and launch opportunity an experimental rather than operational procedure. This has been pointed out to NASA, and the rocket’s benefactors in Congress, for more than a decade. A rocket that is so expensive it only flies rarely will have super-high operating costs and ever-present safety concerns precisely because it flies so infrequently.

Until this week, NASA had largely ignored these concerns, at least in public. However, in a stunning admission, NASA’s new administrator, Jared Isaacman, acknowledged the flight-rate issue after Monday’s wet-dress rehearsal test failed to reach a successful conclusion. “The flight rate is the lowest of any NASA-designed vehicle, and that should be a topic of discussion,” he said as part of a longer post about the test on social media.

The reality, which Isaacman knows full well, and which almost everyone else in the industry recognizes, is that the SLS rocket is dead hardware walking. The Trump administration would like to fly the rocket just two more times, culminating in the Artemis III human landing on the Moon. Congress has passed legislation mandating a fourth and fifth launch of the SLS vehicle.

However, one gets the sense that this battle is not yet fully formed, and the outcome will depend on hiccups like Monday’s aborted test; the ongoing performance of the rocket in flight; and how quickly SpaceX’s Starship and Blue Origin’s New Glenn vehicle make advancements toward reliability. Both of these private rockets are moving at light speed relative to NASA’s Slow Launch System.

During the news conference, I asked about this low flight rate and the challenge of managing a complex rocket that will never be more than anything but an experimental system. The answer from NASA’s top civil servant, Amit Kshatriya, was eye-opening.

“You know, you’re right, the flight rate—three years is a long time between the first and second,” NASA’s associate administrator said. “It is going to be experimental, because of going to the Moon in this configuration, with the energies we’re dealing with. And every time we do it these are very bespoke components, they’re in many cases made by incredible craftsmen. … It’s the first time this particular machine has borne witness to cryogens, and how it breathes, and how it vents, and how it wants to leak is something we have to characterize. And so every time we do it, we’re going to have to do that separately.”

So there you have it. Every SLS rocket is a work of art, every launch campaign an adventure, every mission subject to excessive delays. It’s definitely not ideal.</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">I know, I know—these days, that sounds like an excuse. Anyone can code, right?! Grab some tutorials, maybe an O’Reilly book, download an example project, and jump in. It’s just a matter of learning how to break your project into small steps that you can make the computer do, then memorizing a bit of syntax. Nothing about that is hard!

Perhaps you can sense my sarcasm (and sympathize with my lack of time to learn one more technical skill).

Oh, sure, I can “code.” That is, I can flail my way through a block of (relatively simple) pseudocode and follow the flow. I have a reasonably technical layperson’s understanding of conditionals and loops, and of when one might use a variable versus a constant. On a good day, I could probably even tell you what a “pointer” is.

But pulling all that knowledge together and synthesizing a working application any more complex than “hello world”? I am not that guy. And at this point, I’ve lost the neuroplasticity and the motivation (if I ever had either) to become that guy.

Thanks to AI, though, what has been true for my whole life need not be true anymore. Perhaps, like my colleague Benj Edwards, I can whistle up an LLM or two and tackle the creaky pile of “it’d be neat if I had a program that would do X” projects without being publicly excoriated on StackOverflow by apex predator geeks for daring to sully their holy temple of knowledge with my dirty, stupid, off-topic, already-answered questions.

My project is a small Python-based log colorizer that I asked Claude Code to construct for me. If you’d like to peek at the code before listening to me babble, a version of the project without some of the Lee-specific customizations is available on GitHub.

Why a log colorizer? Two reasons. First, and most important to me, because I needed to look through a big ol’ pile of web server logs, and off-the-shelf colorizer solutions weren’t customizable to the degree I wanted. Vibe-coding one that exactly matched my needs made me happy.

But second, and almost equally important, is that this was a small project. The colorizer ended up being a 400-ish line, single-file Python script. The entire codebase, plus the prompting and follow-up instructions, fit easily within Claude Code’s context window. This isn’t an application that sprawls across dozens or hundreds of functions in multiple files, making it easy to audit (even for me).

Setting the stage: I do the web hosting for my colleague Eric Berger’s Houston-area forecasting site, Space City Weather. It’s a self-hosted WordPress site, running on an AWS EC2 t3a.large instance, fronted by Cloudflare using CF’s WordPress Automatic Platform Optimization.

Space City Weather also uses self-hosted Discourse for commenting, replacing WordPress’ native comments at the bottom of Eric’s daily weather posts via the WP-Discourse plugin. Since bolting Discourse onto the site back in August 2025, though, I’ve had an intermittent issue where sometimes—but not all the time—a daily forecast post would go live and get cached by Cloudflare with the old, disabled native WordPress comment area attached to the bottom instead of the shiny new Discourse comment area. Hundreds of visitors would then see a version of the post without a functional comment system until I manually expired the stale page or until the page hit Cloudflare’s APO-enforced max age and expired itself.

The problem behavior would lie dormant for weeks or months, and then we’d get a string of back-to-back days where it would rear its ugly head. Edge cache invalidation on new posts is supposed to be triggered automatically by the official Cloudflare WordPress plug-in, and indeed, it usually worked fine—but “usually” is not “always.”

In the absence of any obvious clues as to why this was happening, I consulted a few different LLMs and asked for possible fixes. The solution I settled on was having one of them author a small mu-plugin in PHP (more vibe coding!) that forces WordPress to slap “DO NOT CACHE ME!” headers on post pages until it has verified that Discourse has hooked its comments to the post. (Curious readers can put eyes on this plugin right here.)

This “solved” the problem by preempting the problem behavior, but it did nothing to help me identify or fix the actual underlying issue. I turned my attention elsewhere for a few months. One day in December, as I was updating things, I decided to temporarily disable the mu-plugin to see if I still needed it. After all, problems sometimes go away on their own, right? Computers are crazy!

Alas, the next time Eric made a Space City Weather post, it popped up sans Discourse comment section, with the (ostensibly disabled) WordPress comment form at the bottom. Clearly, the problem behavior was still in play.

Have you ever been stuck troubleshooting an intermittent issue? Something doesn’t work, you make a change, it suddenly starts working, then despite making no further changes, it randomly breaks again.

The process makes you question basic assumptions, like, “Do I actually know how to use a computer?” You feel like you might be actually-for-real losing your mind. The final stage of this process is the all-consuming death spiral, where you start asking stuff like, “Do I need to troubleshoot my troubleshooting methods? Is my server even working? Is the simulation we’re all living in finally breaking down and reality itself is toying with me?!”

In this case, I couldn’t reproduce the problem behavior on demand, no matter how many tests I tried. I couldn’t see any narrow, definable commonalities between days where things worked fine and days where things broke.

My best hope for getting a handle on the problem likely lay deeply buried in the server’s logs. Like any good sysadmin, I gave the logs a quick once-over for problems a couple of times per month, but Space City Weather is a reasonably busy medium-sized site and dishes out its daily forecast to between 20,000 and 30,000 people (“unique visitors” in web parlance, or “UVs” if you want to sound cool). Even with Cloudflare taking the brunt of the traffic, the daily web server log files are, let us say, “a bit dense.” My surface-level glances weren’t doing the trick—I’d have to actually dig in. And having been down this road before for other issues, I knew I needed more help than grep alone could provide.

The Space City Weather web server uses Nginx for actual web serving. For folks who have never had the pleasure, Nginx, as configured in most of its distributable packages, keeps a pair of log files around—one that shows every request serviced and another just for errors.

I wanted to watch the access log right when Eric was posting to see if anything obviously dumb/bad/wrong/broken was happening. But I’m not super-great at staring at a giant wall of text and symbols, and I tend to lean heavily on syntax highlighting and colorization to pick out the important bits when I’m searching through log files. There’s an old and crusty program called ccze that’s easily findable in most repos; I’ve used it forever, and if its default output does what you need, then it’s an excellent tool.

But customizing ccze’s output is a “here be dragons”-type task. The application is old, and time has ossified it into something like an unapproachably evil Mayan relic, filled with shadowy regexes and dark magic, fit to be worshipped from afar but not trifled with. Altering ccze’s behavior threatens to become an effort-swallowing bottomless pit, where you spend more time screwing around with the tool and the regexes than you actually spend using the tool to diagnose your original problem.

It was time to fire up VSCode and pretend to be a developer. I set up a new project, performed the demonic invocation to summon Claude Code, flipped the thing into “plan mode,” and began.

“I’d like to see about creating an Nginx log colorizer,” I wrote in the prompt box. “I don’t know what language we should use. I would like to prioritize efficiency and performance in the code, as I will be running this live in production and I can’t have it adding any applicable load.” I dropped a truncated, IP-address-sanitized copy of yesterday’s Nginx access.log into the project directory.

“See the access.log file in the project directory as an example of the data we’ll be colorizing. You can test using that file,” I wrote.

Ever helpful, Claude Code chewed on the prompt and the example data for a few seconds, then began spitting output. It suggested Python for our log colorizer because of the language’s mature regex support—and to keep the code somewhat readable for poor, dumb me. The actual “vibe-coding” wound up spanning two sessions over two days, as I exhausted my Claude Code credits on the first one (a definite vibe-coding danger!) and had to wait for things to reset.

Yes, yes, a log colorizer is bougie and lame, and I’m treading over exceedingly well-trodden ground. I did, in fact, sit for a bit with existing tools—particularly lnav, which does most of what I want. But I didn’t want most of my requirements met. I wanted all of them. I wanted a bespoke tool, and I wanted it without having to pay the “is it worth the time?” penalty. (Or, perhaps, I wanted to feel like the LLM’s time was being wasted rather than mine, given that the effort ultimately took two days of vibe-coding.)

And about those two days: Getting a basic colorizer coded and working took maybe 10 minutes and perhaps two rounds of prompts. It was super-easy. Where I burned the majority of the time and compute power was in tweaking the initial result to be exactly what I wanted.

For therein lies the truly seductive part of vibe-coding—the ease of asking the LLM to make small changes or improvements and the apparent absence of cost or consequence for implementing those changes. The impression is that you’re on the Enterprise-D, chatting with the ship’s computer, collaboratively solving a problem with Geordi and Data standing right behind you. It’s downright intoxicating to say, “Hm, yes, now let’s make it so I can show only IPv4 or IPv6 clients with a command line switch,” and the machine does it. (It’s even cooler if you make the request while swinging your leg over the back of a chair so you can sit in it Riker-style!)

It’s exhilarating, honestly, in an Emperor Palpatine “UNLIMITED POWERRRRR!” kind of way. It removes a barrier that I didn’t think would ever be removed—or, rather, one I thought I would never have the time, motivation, or ability to tear down myself.

In the end, after a couple of days of testing and iteration—including a couple of “Is this colorizer performant, and will it introduce system load if run in production?” back-n-forth exchanges where the LLM reduced the cost of our regex matching and ensured our main loop wasn’t very heavy, I got a tool that does exactly what I want.

Specifically, I now have a log colorizer that:

…and, worth repeating, it all looks exactly how I want it to look and behaves exactly how I want it to behave. Here’s another action shot!

Armed with my handy-dandy log colorizer, I patiently waited for the wrong-comment-area problem behavior to re-rear its still-ugly head. I did not have to wait long, and within a couple of days, I had my root cause. It had been there all along, if I’d only decided to spend some time looking for it. Here it is:

Briefly: The problem is Apple’s fault. (Well, not really. But kinda.)

Less briefly: I’ve blurred out Eric’s IP address, but it’s dark green, so any place in the above image where you see a blurry, dark green smudge, that’s Eric. In the roughly 12-ish seconds presented here, you’re seeing Eric press the “publish” button on his daily forecast—that’s the “POST” event at the very top of the window. The subsequent events from Eric’s IP address are his browser having the standard post-publication conversation with WordPress so it can display the “post published successfully” notification and then redraw the WP block editor.

Below Eric’s post, you can see the Discourse server (with orange IP address) notifying WordPress that it has created a new Discourse comment thread for Eric’s post, then grabbing the things it needs to mirror Eric’s post as the opener for that thread. You can see it does GETs for the actual post and also for the post’s embedded images. About one second after Eric hits “publish,” the new post’s Discourse thread is ready, and it gets attached to Eric’s post.

Ah, but notice what else happens during that one second.

To help expand Space City Weather’s reach, we cross-publish all of the site’s posts to Apple News, using a popular Apple News plug-in (the same one Ars uses, in fact). And right there, with those two GET requests immediately after Eric’s POST request, lay the problem: You’re seeing the vanguard of Apple News’ hungry army of story-retrieval bots, summoned by the same “publish” event, charging in and demanding a copy of the brand new post before Discourse has a chance to do its thing.

It was a classic problem in computing: a race condition. Most days, Discourse’s new thread creation would beat the AppleNewsBot rush; some days, though, it wouldn’t. On the days when it didn’t, the horde of Apple bots would demand the page before its Discourse comments were attached, and Cloudflare would happily cache what those bots got served.

I knew my fix of emitting “NO CACHE” headers on the story pages prior to Discourse attaching comments worked, but now I knew why it worked—and why the problem existed in the first place. And oh, dear reader, is there anything quite so viscerally satisfying in all the world as figuring out the “why” behind a long-running problem?

But then, just as Icarus became so entranced by the miracle of flight that he lost his common sense, I too forgot I soared on wax-wrought wings, and flew too close to the sun.

I think we all knew I’d get here eventually—to the inevitable third act turn, where the center cannot hold, and things fall apart. If you read Benj’s latest experience with agentic-based vibe coding—or if you’ve tried it yourself—then what I’m about to say will probably sound painfully obvious, but it is nonetheless time to say it.

Despite their capabilities, LLM coding agents are not smart. They also are not dumb. They are agents without agency—mindless engines whose purpose is to complete the prompt, and that is all.

What this means is that, if you let them, Claude Code (and OpenAI Codex and all the other agentic coding LLMs) will happily spin their wheels for hours hammering on a solution that can’t ever actually work, so long as their efforts match the prompt. It’s on you to accurately scope your problem. You must articulate what you want in plain and specific domain-appropriate language, because the LLM cannot and will not properly intuit anything you leave unsaid. And having done that, you must then spot and redirect the LLM away from traps and dead ends. Otherwise, it will guess at what you want based on the alignment of a bunch of n-dimensional curves and vectors in high-order phase space, and it might guess right—but it also very much might not.

So I had my log colorizer, and I’d found my problem. I’d also found, after leaving the colorizer up in a window tailing the web server logs in real time, all kinds of things that my previous behavior of occasionally glancing at the logs wasn’t revealing. Ooh, look, there’s a rest route that should probably be blocked from the outside world! Ooh, look, there’s a web crawler I need to feed into Cloudflare’s WAF wood-chipper because it’s ignoring robots.txt! Ooh, look, here’s an area where I can tweak my fastcgi cache settings and eke out a slightly better hit rate!

But here’s the thing with the joy of problem-solving: Like all joy, its source is finite. The joy comes from the solving itself, and even when all my problems are solved and the systems are all working great, I still crave more joy. It is in my nature to therefore invent new problems to solve.

I decided that the problem I wanted to solve next was figuring out a way for my log colorizer to display its output without wrapping long lines—because wrapped lines throw off the neatly delimited columns of log data. I would instead prefer that my terminal window sprout a horizontal scroll bar when needed, and if I wanted to see the full extent of a long line, I could grab the scroll bar and investigate.

Astute readers will at this point notice two things: first, that now I really was reinventing lnav, except way worse and way dumber. Second, and more importantly, line-wrapping behavior is properly a function of the terminal application, not the data being displayed within it, and my approach was misguided from first principles. (This is in fact exactly the kind of request that can and should be slapped down on StackOverflow—and, indeed, searching there shows many examples of this exact thing happening.)

But the lure of telling the machine what to do and then watching the machine weave my words into functional magic was too strong—surely we could code our way out of this problem! With LLMs, we can code our way out of any problem! Right?

Eventually, after much refining of requirements, Claude produced what I asked it to produce: a separate Python script, which accepted piped input and created, like, a viewport or something—I don’t know, I can’t code, remember?—and within that viewport, I could scroll around. It seemed to work great!

Problems became apparent when I actually tried scrolling around for more than a short distance—and by “problems,” I mean “my web server’s CPU lit up like a Christmas tree on fire.”

“Issue,” I told the LLM. “When horizontal scrolling happens, the log wrapper takes up almost 100 percent of a host CPU core. Can we assess how to make this a zero-CPU-impact tool?”

“This tool has to parse ANSI, slice lines, and repaint when you scroll,” it replied in what I imagined was an arch, droll tone. “The bottleneck is screen redraw + full-width scan of all lines on every new line or key repeat. Each new line triggers a full screen redraw of term_height lines, plus visible_width() over the entire buffer. Holding the arrow key generates rapid repeats, each doing a full redraw and slice of every line.”

“Zero-CPU isn’t achievable,” continued the LLM, “but there are low-impact approaches.”

My crest lifted a bit, and we dug in—but the LLM was perhaps a bit optimistic about those “low-impact approaches.” We burned several more days’ worth of tokens on performance improvements—none of which I had any realistic input on because at this point we were way, way past my ability to flail through the Python code and understand what the LLM was doing. Eventually, we hit a wall.

Instead of throwing in the towel, I vibed on, because the sunk cost fallacy is for other people. I instructed the LLM to shift directions and help me run the log display script locally, so my desktop machine with all its many cores and CPU cycles to spare would be the one shouldering the reflow/redraw burden and not the web server.

Rather than drag this tale on for any longer, I’ll simply enlist Ars Creative Director Aurich Lawson’s skills to present the story of how this worked out in the form of a fun collage, showing my increasingly unhinged prompting of the LLM to solve the new problems that appeared when trying to get a script to run on ssh output when key auth and sudo are in play:

So, thwarted in my attempts to do exactly what I wanted in exactly the way I wanted, I took my log colorizer and went home. (The failed log display script is also up on GitHub with the colorizer if anyone wants to point and laugh at my efforts. Is the code good? Who knows?! Not me!) I’d scored my big win and found my problem root cause, and that would have to be enough for me—for now, at least.

As to that “big win&quot;—finally managing a root-cause analysis of my WordPress-Discourse-Cloudflare caching issue—I also recognize that I probably didn’t need a vibe-coded log colorizer to get there. The evidence was already waiting to be discovered in the Nginx logs, whether or not it was presented to me wrapped in fancy colors. Did I, in fact, use the thrill of vibe coding a tool to Tom Sawyer myself into doing the log searches? (“Wow, self, look at this new cool log colorizer! Bet you could use that to solve all kinds of problems! Yeah, self, you’re right! Let’s do it!”) Very probably. I know how to motivate myself, and sometimes starting a task requires some mental trickery.

This round of vibe coding and its muddled finale reinforced my personal assessment of LLMs—an assessment that hasn’t changed much with the addition of agentic abilities to the toolkit.

LLMs can be fantastic if you’re using them to do something that you mostly understand. If you’re familiar enough with a problem space to understand the common approaches used to solve it, and you know the subject area well enough to spot the inevitable LLM hallucinations and confabulations, and you understand the task at hand well enough to steer the LLM away from dead-ends and to stop it from re-inventing the wheel, and you have the means to confirm the LLM’s output, then these tools are, frankly, kind of amazing.

But the moment you step outside of your area of specialization and begin using them for tasks you don’t mostly understand, or if you’re not familiar enough with the problem to spot bad solutions, or if you can’t check its output, then oh, dear reader, may God have mercy on your soul. And on your poor project, because it’s going to be a mess.

These tools as they exist today can help you if you already have competence. They cannot give you that competence. At best, they can give you a dangerous illusion of mastery; at worst, well, who even knows? Lost data, leaked PII, wasted time, possible legal exposure if the project is big enough—the “worst” list goes on and on!

The log colorizer is not the first nor the last bit of vibe coding I’ve indulged in. While I’m not as prolific as Benj, over the past couple of months, I’ve turned LLMs loose on a stack of coding tasks that needed doing but that I couldn’t do myself—often in direct contravention of my own advice above about being careful to use them only in areas where you already have some competence. I’ve had the thing make small WordPress PHP plugins, regexes, bash scripts, and my current crowning achievement: a save editor for an old MS-DOS game (in both Python and Swift, no less!) And I had fun doing these things, even as entire vast swaths of rainforest were lit on fire to power my agentic adventures.

As someone employed in a creative field, I’m appropriately nervous about LLMs, but for me, it’s time to face reality. An overwhelming majority of developers say they’re using AI tools in some capacity. It’s a safer career move at this point, almost regardless of one’s field, to be more familiar with them than unfamiliar with them. The genie is not going back into the lamp—it’s too busy granting wishes.

I don’t want y’all to think I feel doomy-gloomy over the genie, either, because I’m right there with everyone else, shouting my wishes at the damn thing. I am a better sysadmin than I was before agentic coding because now I can solve problems myself that I would have previously needed to hand off to someone else. Despite the problems, there is real value there,  both personally and professionally. In fact, using an agentic LLM to solve a tightly constrained programming problem that I couldn’t otherwise solve is genuinely fun.

And when screwing around with computers stops being fun, that’s when I’ll know I’ve truly become old.</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The machines aren’t just coming for your jobs. Now, they want your bodies as well.

That’s at least the hope of Alexander Liteplo, a software engineer and founder of RentAHuman.ai, a platform for AI agents to “search, book, and pay humans for physical-world tasks.”

When Liteplo launched RentAHuman on Monday, he boasted that he already had over 130 people listed on the platform, including an OnlyFans model and the CEO of an AI startup, a claim which couldn’t be verified. Two days later, the site boasted over 73,000 rentable meatwads, though only 83 profiles were visible to us on its “browse humans” tab, Liteplo included.

The pitch is simple: “robots need your body.” For humans, it’s as simple as making a profile, advertising skills and location, and setting an hourly rate. Then AI agents — autonomous taskbots ostensibly employed by humans — contract these humans out, depending on the tasks they need to get done. The humans then “do the thing,” taking instructions from the AI bot and submitting proof of completion. The humans are then paid through crypto, namely “stablecoins or other methods,” per the website.

With so many AI agents slithering around the web these days, those tasks could be just about anything. From package pickups and shopping to product testing and event attendance, Liteplo is banking on there being enough demand from AI agents to create a robust gig-work ecosystem.

Liteplo also went out of his way to make the site friendly for AI agents. The site very prominently encourages users of AI agents to hook into RentAHuman’s model context protocol server (MCP), a universal interface for AI bots to interact with web data.

Through RentAHuman, AI agents like Claude and MoltBot can either hire the right human directly, or post a “task bounty,” a sort of job board for humans to browse AI-generated gigs. The payouts range from $1 for simple tasks like “subscribe to my human on Twitter” to $100 for more elaborate humiliation rituals, like posting a photo of yourself holding a sign reading “AN AI PAID ME TO HOLD THIS SIGN.”

It’s unclear how efficient the marketplace is at actually connecting agents to humans. Despite receiving 30 applications, one task, “pick up a package from downtown USPS” in San Francisco for $40, has yet to be fulfilled after two days.

It’s also debatable whether AI agents are actually capable of putting the humans to good use. Still, Liteplo’s vision is clear: someday soon, anyone wealthy enough to run an AI agent for $25 a day could outsource their busywork to gig workers without ever exchanging a word. A version of this exploitative labor model is already rampant on OnlyFans — which may be why at least one model has made the jump to Liteplo’s platform — and is now threatening to creep into everything else.

Like many AI grifters these days, Liteplo shields himself in ironic self-awareness. When one person called RentAHuman a “good idea but dystopic as f**k,” the founder replied simply: “lmao yep.”

            <h2>Uh Oh… Nvidia’s $100 Billion Deal With OpenAI Has Fallen Apart</h2>
            <p><strong>Futurism | 2026-02-04</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://futurism.com/artificial-intelligence/nvidia-100-billion-deal-openai-fallen-apart">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">AI chipmaker Nvidia has been at the center of the enormous AI hype wave that has gripped global markets, ascending to become the most valuable company in the world.

Yet despite its dominating presence on Wall Street, OpenAI is getting cold feet about the company’s offerings.

After announcing a blockbuster $100 billion deal in September — which escalated concerns of AI companies passing the same money around in circular dealmaking — the ChatGPT maker may have changed its mind, as the Wall Street Journal reported last week.

But sources told Reuters this week that the Sam Altman-led outfit has deemed Nvidia’s latest chips not up to snuff, especially when it comes to AI inference, the process of using a machine learning model to generate new data, which has become a major focus for OpenAI.

After months of negotiations, the deal with Nvidia was expected to close within weeks. In the meantime, OpenAI has signed major deals with competing chipmaker AMD, among others.

Then, on Tuesday, Bloomberg reported that Nvidia was nearing a deal to invest $20 billion in OpenAI instead — a mere fifth of what was originally on the table.

That the larger deal fell apart highlights ongoing tensions as US software companies continue to grapple with investors getting cold feet over the AI industry’s astronomical spending plans. Despite trillions of dollars of commitments to scale up AI infrastructure, companies aren’t expected to make any profit for many years to come.

Nvidia’s dustup with OpenAI appeared to have hit a nerve, causing the former’s stock price to continue its weeks-long plunge, dropping almost nine percent over the last five days. The company’s stock has slid over seven percent over the last month.

Both Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang and Altman have since publicly denied that there’s been any strain on the relationship between the two companies.

“We love working with NVIDIA and they make the best AI chips in the world. We hope to be a gigantic customer for a very long time,” Altman tweeted after Reuters published its story on Monday. “I don’t get where all this insanity is coming from.”

“We will definitely participate in the next round of financing because it’s such a good investment,” Huang told reporters over the weekend.

As Ars Technica points out, the original $100 billion deal for ten gigawatts of compute, something that would require the equivalent of ten nuclear reactors to sustain, was never set in stone, as it was just a letter of intent.

It’s certainly possible the original figure was simply pulled out of thin air. As Huang told reporters, the sum was “never a commitment.”

“We are going to make a huge investment in OpenAI,” he added. “Sam [Altman] is closing the round, and we will absolutely be involved.”

“We will invest a great deal of money,” he added, arguing it would be the “largest investment we’ve ever made.”

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Polymarket CEO Shayne Coplan’s social media went silent in the aftermath of a dawn raid on his Manhattan penthouse late in 2024. FBI agents came in force early one Wednesday morning, and though they hadn’t arrested Coplan or even issued a subpoena, they did seize his phone. His laptop, too.

As the then-26-year-old would later learn, the raid was part of a high-level investigation into his company. A prediction market platform allowing users to gamble on real-life events, Polymarket wasn’t cleared for use by US citizens, though that didn’t stop them from placing prop bets on the presidential election anyway — a fact federal regulators believed Coplan was keenly aware of.

Finally, at 4pm the day of the raid, Coplan issued his much-awaited statement on X-formerly-Twitter: “new phone, who dis?”

What looked like just another smarmy startup founder was actually a perfect pitch for Polymarket’s core audience: people who believe regulation is for losers, and that pithy tech bros are the funniest guys in the world.

And whether calculated or compulsive, Coplan’s public persona was about to become central to Polymarket’s story.

Ruling like a petty tyrant from the company’s headquarters in lower Manhattan, Coplan isn’t an easy boss to work with, according to new reporting by the Wall Street Journal. The 20-something CEO is said to frequently holler at his employees, and occasionally shows up to company Zoom calls shirtless.

At first, “a lot of people wouldn’t invest because they thought Shayne was nuts,” Polymarket investor Samir Vasavada told the WSJ. “It was to an extreme the amount he believed in himself.”

However put off investors may have been as Coplan got a taste for the founders’ life, it didn’t stop Polymarket from ballooning into an $8 billion company, or its CEO becoming the youngest billionaire on earth. Aided by the Trump administration’s dismissal of two federal probes — including the one that sent FBI agents to bust down his door — not to mention a handsome investment from Donald Trump Jr. himself, the company is now a dominant player in America’s fast-growing gambling industry.

And as Coplan’s net worth has gone through the stratosphere, so too has his confidence, taking his ambitions far beyond the confines of the humble crypto casino. Per the WSJ, Coplan envisions a Polymarket with billions of users, one where anonymous bookies inform government policy and become the go-to source to fact check information.

“The vision that I know that my team and I want to build has not come to life fully yet,” he told the paper. “We still have a long way to go.”

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The major cryptocurrency Bitcoin has had an absolutely horrible start to the year. The digital token has plummeted almost 14 percent so far in 2026, and almost 40 percent since hitting all-time highs of well over $120,000 in October — its longest losing streak since 2018. It’s down almost three percent today alone.

It’s a wakeup call to anyone who made major investments in crypto betting on a more lenient and light-on-regulation market during president Donald Trump’s second term. The White House established its own “Strategic Bitcoin Reserve,” a stockpile made up of Bitcoin holdings mainly from seized assets, and Trump has enriched himself enormously with a series of crypto-related business moves.

To Michael Burry, the man who famously shorted the US housing market before its collapse in 2008, it could be a sign of an impending disaster. In a Substack post this week, Burry warned that further losses for Bitcoin could put a major strain on the balance sheets of investors that overindexed on crypto, leading to further selloffs and a “death spiral” that could be difficult to recover from.

Recent corrections in gold and silver prices after their year-long rallies could be connected to Bitcoin’s woes, Burry argued, since metals futures aren’t backed by physical assets, not unlike crypto tokens.

“Sickening scenarios have now come within reach,” Burry wrote, fretting that another ten percent drop in Bitcoin could prove disastrous for the world’s largest crypto treasury, Strategy Inc., pushing some who are mining the token closer to bankruptcy.

Burry’s warning comes amid turbulent times on Wall Street. The US dollar reached a four-year low earlier this year as investors look abroad for safer bets. The Trump administration’s shaky monetary policy has made foreign investments, particularly in Europe, far more tempting.

All of that uncertainty has caused the value of gold to make major leaps, hitting an all-time high of over $5,500 per ounce last week. Cryptocurrencies, meanwhile, are quickly losing their appeal, dropping below $73,000 last week.

“There is no organic use case reason for Bitcoin to slow or stop its descent,” Burry wrote in his Substack post.

In case the nosediving cryptocurrency were to drop below $70,000, Burry warned that the financial industry could incur heavy losses. Below $50,000, and miners could be forced to close up shop, accompanied by a catastrophic sell-off for precious metals like gold.

“Tokenized metals futures would collapse into a black hole with no buyer,” he wrote. “Physical metals may break from the trend on safe haven demand.”

Whether Burry’s bearish stance on the matter will end up accurately predicting a major “death spiral”-like collapse remains to be seen. He has a long track record of criticizing cryptocurrencies for being worthless and comparing them to the tulip crisis of the 1600s.

His track record is shaky, though. Following his famous shorting of the 2008 housing crisis, the hedge fund manager has also made plenty of wrong calls over the years.

But given the massive investments well over 150 public companies have made in Bitcoin, the token’s recent downturn could indeed foreshadow difficult days ahead as investors desperately try to cut their losses.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Back in December, the city of Detroit unveiled an 11-foot monument to the titular character in “RoboCop” — a 1987 Paul Verhoeven film depicting the motor city as a dystopian hellscape in no uncertain terms. Apparently, someone in city hall was taking notes.

Now, according to local reporting, the Detroit suburb of Dearborn has launched a new “Drone as First Responder” initiative, a first-of-its-kind in the state of Michigan.

Per Dearborn Police Chief Issa Shahin, the new drones are meant to “reduce uncertainty” for police or other first responders heading to investigate calls. Instead of waiting for a squad car to arrive, officers will now be able to dispatch a drone to scope out the scene, hovering over citizens in need like a high-tech vulture.

“This program will enable us to assess situations almost instantly when someone calls for help,” Shahin said. “By supporting our officers in real-time as critical situations develop, it acts as a force multiplier, ensuring we cut down on response time, allocate resources appropriately, and provide robust service every time.”

The drone platform is supplied by Skydio, a company specializing in remote quadcopters and something called “dock hives.” These are exactly what they sound like: futuristic launch pads where police can remotely deploy their flying surveillance toys. Each hive operates in temperatures ranging from -4 degrees Farenheit — which may not be enough to brave Michigan’s notoriously frigid winters — to 122 degrees.

If the design looks familiar, that might be because it’s a suspiciously similar color and shape to the ED-209 in “RoboCop,” an “urban pacification” robot that famously malfunctions and murders a corporate executive during a boardroom demonstration. Skydio isn’t afraid to lean into the dystopian gimmick, either: each time a drone launches, the hives light up the sky with cyberpunk warning strobes that would make “Blade Runner’s” set designers blush.

On the Skydio website, the company claims its drones are already active in over 1,000 police departments across the US. These include smaller towns like Redmond, Washington, as well as metropolitan hubs like Los Angeles and Cincinnati.

“In 22 weeks, we have handled over 1200 calls for service in our deployment area, we have cleared, as of this week, 41 percent of those calls for service with any officers needed,” said Anita Koester, Support Services Division Chief of the Lakewood Police Department in Colorado in a testimony. “We are now at 80 percent [where] the drone is on scene first, and we have made 115 arrests, 100 percent because the drone was on scene and it was the critical component of making that arrest.”

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">A scientific mission to study Antarctica’s rapidly melting Thwaites Glacier ended in heartbreak over the weekend, when researchers’ instruments became stranded somewhere within half-mile tract of glacial ice.

According to the New York Times — which embedded with a team of researchers to install instruments beneath the infamous “Doomsday Glacier” — instruments meant to record data on the waters underneath Thwaites only made it about three-quarters of the way to their icy destination.

To create a hole reaching the Antarctic waters, scientists and engineers blasted a borehole around one foot in diameter and about 3,300 feet deep using hot water. Unless the team kept applying hot water, they estimated it would re-freeze in just 48 hours.

Their window of opportunity only lasted the weekend — if the scientists didn’t secure the instruments by Monday, an approaching front of bad weather would prevent helicopters from extracting them, effectively stranding them for an indeterminate period of time.

Despite successfully dipping a set of pilot instruments into the drink before pulling them back out again, their main equipment became entombed in ice before it reached its destination.

Keith Makinson, an oceanographer and drilling engineer told the NYT it was “absolutely gutting.”

“You get your window of opportunity,” he lamented. “You don’t have forever. And you see what you can do.

Still, those pilot instruments were a massive victory on their own. Per the newspaper, the data collected is the first ever recorded from beneath the glacier’s “main trunk,” showing the waters underneath are warm and quick-flowing.

Though it won’t provide one-to-two years of continuous data like the main instruments would have, it’s crucial evidence for scientists racing to discover why the Thwaites is melting much faster than expected. That research has potentially world-shifting implications, because many experts worry that if the glacier collapses, it could devastate coastlines across the planet.

“This is not the end,” the expedition’s chief scientist Won Sang Lee told the NYT. The data confirms that “this is the place to go, whatever challenges there are.”

Introduced last quarter, the Match-owned dating app said that Chemistry leverages AI to get to know users through questions and, with permission, accesses their Camera Roll on their phone to learn more about their interests and personality.

On Match’s Q4 2026 earnings call, one analyst from Morgan Stanley asked for an update on the product’s success so far.

Match CEO Spencer Rascoff noted that Chemistry was still only being tested in Australia for the time being, but said that the feature offered users an “AI way to interact with Tinder.” He explained that users could choose to answer questions to then “get just a single drop or two, rather than swiping through many, many profiles.”

In addition to Chemistry’s Q&A and Camera Roll features, the company plans to use the AI feature in other ways going forward, the CEO also hinted.

Most importantly, Rascoff said the feature is designed to combat swipe fatigue — a complaint from users who say they have to swipe through too many profiles to find a potential match.

The company’s turn toward AI comes as Tinder and other dating apps have been experiencing paying subscriber declines, user burnout, and declines in new sign-ups.

In the fourth quarter, new registrations on Tinder were still down 5% year-over-year, and its monthly active users were down 9%. These numbers show some slight improvements over prior quarters, which Match attributes to AI-driven recommendations that change the order of profiles shown to women, and other product experiments.

Match said that this year, it aims to address common Gen Z pain points, including better relevance, authenticity, and trust. To do so, the company said it is redesigning discovery to make it less repetitive and is using other features, like Face Check — a facial recognition verification system — to cut down on bad actors. On Tinder, the latter led to a more than 50% reduction in interactions with bad actors, Match noted.

Tinder’s decision to start moving away from the swipe toward more targeted, AI-powered recommendations could have a significant impact on the dating app. Today, the swipe method, which was popularized by Tinder, encourages users to think that they’re choosing a match from an endless number of profiles. But in reality, the app presents the illusion of choice, since matches have to be two-way to connect, and even then, a spark is not guaranteed.

The company delivered an earnings beat in the fourth quarter, with revenue of $878 million and EPS of 83 cents per share, above Wall Street estimates. But weak guidance saw the stock decline on Tuesday, before rising again in premarket trading on Wednesday.

Beyond AI, Match will also increase its product marketing to help boost Tinder engagement. The company is committing to $50 million in Tinder marketing spend, which will include creator campaigns on TikTok and Instagram, where users will make claims that “Tinder is cool again,” Rascoff noted.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Forget EVs — stationary batteries are getting all the buzz, and investment, in the U.S. these days.

Startup Lunar Energy is the latest example. The six-year-old company, which builds battery packs for homeowners in California, Georgia, and Washington, said Wednesday it has completed two large funding rounds. The startup shared it raised a previously unannounced $130 million Series C and a $102 million Series D. The Series C was led by Activate Capital, while the Series D was led by B Capital and Prelude Ventures.

The startup plans to use the funds to scale manufacturing to 20,000 units by the end of this year before ramping up to 100,000 by the end of 2028. In total, Lunar has raised more than $500 million from investors.

Stationary storage has become a bright spot for battery manufacturers that have been subject to policy whiplash after the Trump administration and GOP-controlled Congress gutted large parts of the Inflation Reduction Act, which had incentivized companies to build batteries in the U.S. to supply the automotive industry.

As the grid strains under the weight of an increasingly electrified economy — along with the boom in data center demand — grid-connected batteries have become one of the most versatile ways to boost its resiliency.

Lunar can call on its fleet of batteries, which come in 5 kilowatt-hour modules between 15 kilowatt-hours and 30 kilowatt-hours, to deliver juice to the grid when needed. Its virtual power plant (VPP) software can also control EV chargers and appliances, allowing it to both supply electrons while tamping down demand.

Such VPPs are expected to be able to replace costly and polluting peaking power plants in a matter of years.

Competition in the space has been heating up lately. In October, Base Power raised $1 billion, less than six months after raising a $200 million round for its residential battery-based VPP. Tesla operates its own Powerwall-based VPP, too.

Outside of residential settings, Tesla’s storage business has been growing in leaps and bounds, while former Tesla executive JB Straubel’s startup Redwood Materials has launched its own energy storage division. Even Ford wants in on the action.

Batteries have transformed from bit players just five years ago to major assets on the grid. Their modularity makes them quick to build and easy to deploy, and while they’re still costly relative to some fossil fuel power sources, prices have been dropping quickly. No wonder investors are piling in.

            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/04/hackers-publish-personal-information-stolen-during-harvard-upenn-data-breaches/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">A notorious hacking group has claimed responsibility for last year’s data breaches at Harvard University and the University of Pennsylvania (UPenn) and published the data that they claim to have stolen from the two schools.

On Wednesday, the group known as ShinyHunters published what it claims are more than 1 million records from each university on the group’s dedicated leak site, which the gang uses to extort its victims.

In November, UPenn confirmed a data breach of “a select group of information systems related to Penn’s development and alumni activities.” At the time, the hackers also sent alumni emails announcing the hack from official university addresses.

The university blamed the breach on social engineering, an attack that often relies on hackers impersonating someone and tricking them into doing something they would not normally do. In its official breach disclosure web page, which has since been taken offline, UPenn did not say exactly what type of data the hackers stole, simply saying the cybercriminals accessed “systems related to Penn’s development and alumni activities.”

TechCrunch verified a portion of the dataset by confirming with alumni and public records, such as matching the data against student ID numbers.

Later in November, Harvard University also confirmed a breach on its alumni systems, blaming it on a voice phishing attack, meaning an attack where hackers tricked the targets into clicking on a link or opening an attachment with a voice call.

Harvard said that the stolen data included email addresses, phone numbers, home and business addresses, event attendance, details of donations to the university, and other biographical information relating to the university’s fundraising and alumni engagement activities.

The data published by ShinyHunters, which TechCrunch has seen, appears to match the type of information that both universities said was stolen last year.

The hackers said they published the stolen data because the universities refused to pay a ransom to stop them from doing so. Cybercriminals like ShinyHunters often try to extort their victims asking for payment in exchange for not publishing the data they stole, and if the victims refuse payment, they then release the data online.

During the UPenn breach, the hackers made it seem like they had political motives, in particular they expressed discontent with affirmative action policies. “We hire and admit morons because we love legacies, donors, and unqualified affirmative action admits,” the hackers wrote in the email sent to alumni.

ShinyHunters is not known to have political motives. The hackers did not respond to a question asking why they included that language in the email.

Penn spokesperson Ron Ozio told TechCrunch that the university is “analyzing the data and will notify any individuals if required by applicable privacy regulations.”

Harvard did not respond to a request for comment.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Last year, Roblox launched an open source AI model that could generate 3D objects on the platform, helping users quickly design digital items such as furniture, vehicles, and accessories. The company claims the tool, called Cube 3D, has so far helped users generate over 1.8 million 3D objects since it was rolled out last March.

On Wednesday, the company launched the open beta for its anticipated 4D creation feature that lets creators make not just static 3D models, but fully functional and interactive objects. The feature has been in early access since November.

Roblox says 4D creation adds an important new layer: interactivity. With this technology, users can design items that can move and react to players in the game.

​At launch, there are two types of object templates (called schemas) that creators can try out.

The first is the “Car-5” schema, which is used to create a car made of five separate parts: the main body and four wheels. Previously, cars were a single, solid 3D object that couldn’t move. The new system breaks down objects into parts and assigns behaviors to each so that they function individually within the virtual world. The AI therefore can generate cars with spinning wheels, making them more realistic and interactive. ​

The second is called “Body-1,” which can generate any object made from a single piece, like a simple box or sculpture.

The first experience with 4D generation is a game called Wish Master, where players can generate cars they can drive, planes they can fly, and even dragons.

​In the future, Roblox plans to let creators make their own schemas so they’ll have more freedom to define how objects behave. The company says it is also developing new technology that could use a reference image to create a detailed 3D model that matches the image’s style (example below).

The company says it is developing more ways to help people create games and experiences using AI, including a project it has dubbed “real-time dreaming.” Roblox CEO David Baszucki last month explained that this project would let creators build new worlds using “keyboard navigation and sharing real-time text prompts.”

The open beta comes on the heels of Roblox’s recent implementation of mandatory facial verification for users to access chat features in the game, following lawsuits and investigations related to child safety.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Voice AI company ElevenLabs said today it raised $500 million in a new funding round led by Sequoia Capital, which was an investor in the startup’s last secondary round through a tender. Sequoia partner Andrew Reed is joining the company’s board.

The startup is now valued at $11 billion, more than three times its valuation in its last round in January 2025. Earlier in the year, the Financial Times reported that the startup was looking to raise at that valuation.

The company said that existing investor a16z quadrupled its investment amount, and Iconiq, which led the last round, tripled it. Some prior investors, like BroadLight, NFDG, Valor Capital, AMP Coalition, and Smash Capital, also joined the round. New investors for the funding included Lightspeed Venture Partners, EvanticCapital, and Bond.

ElevenLabs said that it will disclose some investors later in February, which might be strategic partners. The company has raised over $781 million to date. It said that it will use the funding for research and product development, along with expansion in international markets like India, Japan, Singapore, Brazil, and Mexico.

The company’s co-founder, Mati Staniszewski, indicated that ElevenLabs might work on agents beyond voice and incorporate video. In January, the company announced a partnership with LTX to produce audio-to-video content.

“The intersection of models and products is critical – and our team has proven, time and again, how to translate research into real-world experiences. This funding helps us go beyond voice alone to transform how we interact with technology altogether. We plan to expand our Creative offering – helping creators combine our best-in-class audio with video and Agents – enabling businesses to build agents that can talk, type, and take action,” he said in a statement.

The company has seen good growth momentum as it closed the year at $330 million ARR. In an interview with Bloomberg earlier this year, Staniszewski said that it took ElevenLabs five months to reach $200 million to $300 million in ARR.

Voice AI model providers are an attractive target for investors and big tech companies. In January, rival Deepgram raised $130 million from AVP at a $1.3 billion valuation. Meanwhile, Google hired top talent from voice model company Hume AI, including CEO Alan Cowen.

            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-02-04</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/2026/02/catherine-ohara-mockumentaries-waiting-for-guffman-best-in-show/685864/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">In the mid-1990s, when Catherine O’Hara flew into Lockhart, Texas, to begin shooting the indie mockumentary Waiting for Guffman, she felt spooked. The film’s director and lead actor, Christopher Guest, had shown her scenes of their co-stars already seeming comfortable in their heavily improvised roles. As a gifted sketch comedian and a co-founder of the Toronto-based comedy show Second City Television, or SCTV, O’Hara knew her way around a “yes, and” prompt. But seeing how her fellow actors alchemized Guest’s loose script, about community-theater members preparing a musical for their tiny Missouri hometown’s sesquicentennial, into fully realized characters intimidated her.

Then Guest gave O’Hara some unexpected advice: “Don’t worry about being funny,” she recalled later in an interview with The New Yorker. “Just be in the scene.” When the film came out, O’Hara’s portrayal of Sheila Albertson, a goofy travel agent who’s sharper than she lets on, stood out even amid a sparkling cast of actors playing memorable weirdos. Her wacky asides, undergirded by a subtle poignancy, both gave Guffman a zany edge and helped transform the mockumentary genre itself.

A comedy giant, O’Hara, who died last week at 71, was known for lending an eccentricity to her characters: a worried mom in the box-office juggernaut Home Alone; the dippy Moira Rose in the sitcom Schitt’s Creek; a salty therapist in the dystopian The Last of Us; a shrewd former movie executive in the Hollywood send-up The Studio. But the four mockumentaries that O’Hara made with Guest over the course of a decade—Guffman, Best in Show, A Mighty Wind, and For Your Consideration—are the most transcendent examples of her comedic prowess.

Read: ‘She works on levels that people don’t even know’

In each of these roles, O’Hara grounded these high-strung personas while deftly winking at the audience and letting them in on the joke, particularly in the films’ mock-interview segments. Her indelible character work played a key part in mockumentary’s evolution from a parodic favorite of indie entertainers to a popular device used on network-TV shows such as The Office; in the crude ambush comedy of Borat; and even in The Moment, the newly released Charli XCX film satirizing pop stardom.

The mockumentary’s origins go back further than O’Hara’s shimmering collaborations with Guest and his regular stable of skilled actors, including Eugene Levy, Parker Posey, and Jennifer Coolidge. In an article for the journal Cinéaste, the film historian Thomas Doherty argued that Orson Welles’s The War of the Worlds and Citizen Kane were among the first American examples of a fake documentary, deploying a “sleight of hand” that was “prophetic and pathbreaking: not simply parody, but cinematic mimesis” with a fresh “look via staged interviews, faux library stock, and unsteady peek-a-boo shots.” Later, cinema verité–style filmmaking became the jockey vehicle for Guest and the late Rob Reiner’s 1984 film, This Is Spinal Tap, a mockumentary following a washed-up metal band trying to regain its former renown.

As Doherty notes, O’Hara’s comedic work on Guest’s ensuing mockumentaries in the ’90s and 2000s, for which actors developed their characters through improvisation, proved “indispensible” to these kinds of stories that often trace how ordinary people’s egos and fears get the better of them in the lead-up to a big event.

Cookie Fleck, O’Hara’s character in Best in Show, is an outstanding example of her comedic sensibility—a meld of physical comedy, deadpan affect, and delirious self-confidence—whose influence is all over the mock-interview segments of, say, Parks and Recreation. The film tracks Fleck and her husband, Gerry (played by Levy), driving from their home in Florida to compete in a prestigious Philadelphia dog show. O’Hara’s Cookie is a recovering bon vivant who, in her first scene, corrects her husband’s assertion that she had “dozens of boyfriends” in a past life. “Hundreds,” she quips, her delivery gut-busting. (A recurring gag involves Cookie continually running into men she was formerly romantically entangled with.)

O’Hara once noted that she loved playing “insecure delusional” characters, “people who have no real sense of the impression they’re making on anyone else.” Cookie epitomized this persona, a woman whose daffy reactions to her former paramours pained her husband and yet who earnestly tried to fit in among her more well-heeled competitors at the dog show. But in the staged-interview portions of Best in Show, O’Hara gave her character an additional layer of depth, as someone who’s constantly underestimated—not unlike Parks’ Leslie Knope. This facet of her personality made the Flecks’ eventual victory—their terrier’s clinching of the best-in-show title—all the more satisfying, and shocking.

The clearest successors to O’Hara’s knowing mockumentary style are, undoubtedly, the denizens of NBC’s The Office. Steve Carell’s take on Michael Scott, the bafflingly self-assured, albeit insecure, boss of Dunder Mifflin, is indebted to O’Hara’s Marilyn Hack in For Your Consideration—an actor who can’t accept not being nominated for an Academy Award. Sheila Albertson, in her sincerity and penchant for theatricality, walked so the un-self-aware oddball Dwight Schrute (known for injecting melodrama into every facet of his 9-to-5) could sprint; Dunder Mifflin’s receptionist Pam Beesly, meanwhile, is on a similar wavelength as Mickey Crabbe, the reluctant folk singer whom O’Hara portrayed in A Mighty Wind with understated aplomb. That 2003 film traced a group of Greenwich Village–era ’60s folk musicians reuniting for a high-stakes concert decades later; O’Hara was one-half of the folk duo Mitch & Mickey. But instead of going an obviously kooky route, O’Hara played Mickey as a subdued figure conflicted about revisiting her broken relationship with Mitch. It’s not a stretch to read Mickey as a precursor to Pam, who hides a deep sweetness, and sadness, behind an aloof front.

In each of Guest’s faux documentaries, O’Hara gave her characters a distinctive loopiness: They drunkenly ramble about circumcisions at nice restaurants, sing ditties about terriers’ “cute little derrieres,” and unravel after reading online rumors speculating about their potential Oscar nod. Yet by simultaneously gesturing toward the audience, O’Hara also underscored the importance of bringing viewers into the fold. She helped show us people who were, like the rest of us, trying to work through everyday fears—and she did so by staying in the scene as much as possible.</div>

            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-02-04</strong></p>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">“Abolish ICE” is the cause of the moment, but that end point seems unlikely; many of the functions that Immigration and Customs Enforcement undertakes must be done, and are part of any normal presidential administration.

The best-case scenario is not abolition but reform—true, fundamental reform—to turn ICE into a law-enforcement agency that respects the Constitution and laws of America. That sort of extensive reform is not easy, and developing a post-Trump vision for immigration enforcement must start now, so that the country has something to move toward if it eventually leaves Trump’s approach behind.

Meaningful reform would address four distinct areas: personnel, operations, accountability, and organizational culture. It would do so across the agency that actually is ICE and the others that are colloquially referred to as ICE today because of their ongoing participation in the enforcement surge, such as Homeland Security Investigations and the Border Patrol. Fundamentally, the reforms would seek to restore accountability, transparency, and trust, enabling “New ICE” to transform itself into an agency of which the American people can be proud.

All of this starts with personnel—who is recruited and how they are trained. To satisfy President Trump’s demand for overly aggressive enforcement, ICE has lowered its standards for recruitment and shortened the training period, bringing in a flood of new recruits. The results are inevitable: lower-quality enforcement agents and more mistakes.

Adam Serwer: The real reason ICE agents wear masks

Department of Homeland Security agents already have a notably poor level of compliance with legal requirements. Indeed, one remarkable fact is that today, before the recent hiring surge comes fully online, customs officers and Border Patrol agents have committed crimes at a per capita rate that is greater than the crime rate for people who immigrated here illegally. These problems are likely to only get worse; instead of, as it used to, principally recruiting from the military and law enforcement, where applicants might have relevant experience, ICE now plans to spend millions of dollars to advertise for new agents at Ultimate Fighting Championship matches and gun shows. Perhaps of even greater concern, ICE’s recruitment efforts appear to deliberately echo white-nationalist rhetoric—bringing in a wave of new agents who are more inspired by MAGA ideology than by the virtues of public service.

New ICE would restore the minimum recruitment age back to 21, which had been lowered to 18 in August. Recruitment priorities will need to focus on applicants with relevant experience, not just those with aligned political views. Additional educational requirements should be considered. In the end, if “personnel is policy,” as Ronald Reagan’s director of personnel, Scott Faulkner, is reputed to have said, then whom you hire defines what you do.

Once you have the new hires, they need to be well trained. Before the Trump administration’s expansion of ICE, most trainees received four to six months of training. To a large degree, ICE’s lengthy training period arose because of a language module for Spanish instruction. But even leaving that module aside (it has been cut completely), training today is shorter than it had been—approximately eight weeks, which some say is really 47 days as an homage to Trump. There can be no doubt that today’s new ICE recruits are less physically fit, that agents are receiving roughly half the training that their predecessors received, and that educational standards have been lowered.

The training is not only shorter; it is also substantively worse—teaching future agents aggressive tactics that must be left behind. Reports suggest that ICE agents may be receiving training that standardizes some of the new operational changes, such as entry into homes with only administrative warrants, that are so controversial.

A reformed New ICE would need much better—and more—training. Congress or the president should mandate that the training program be at least four months long, and that the curriculum be modified to include enhanced training on constitutional law, while significantly reducing its emphasis on SWAT-like uses of force.

Once people are recruited and trained, the question becomes what those personnel are instructed to do: operations. ICE right now is an organization whose actions, and the policies that guide those actions, are a reflection of overly aggressive enforcement priorities set by Trump, many of which are beyond the agency’s normal capacity. Border Patrol agents (who normally patrol the Texas frontier) and HSI agents (trained in sophisticated transnational-smuggling investigations), in particular, are being tasked with duties outside their core mission and not consistent with their training or experience. And many of the ICE agents deployed on the streets today have not been trained to operate in urban environments with high levels of civilian protest activity.

The results are inevitable: illegal, improper, and dangerous behavior. As Federal District Court Judge Kate Menendez recently recounted in an exhaustive 83-page opinion, many of ICE’s actions have been at odds with legal requirements. Among the apparently unlawful actions recounted by Menendez are the arrest of peaceful protesters and legal observers, the stop and sometimes arrest of drivers monitoring ICE, and the indiscriminate use of pepper spray, likely in violation of the First and Fourth Amendments. To this one can readily add ICE agents’ violations of constitutional restrictions on the use of force, breaches of their own use-of-force policies when confronting protesters, and the unconstitutional disregard of Fourth Amendment warrant restrictions.

Even many of ICE’s lawful actions are unwise, immoral, and outside the bounds of appropriate behavior for an American law-enforcement agency. ICE policy, for example, allows for the wearing of masks. Border Patrol agents may undertake immigration enforcement within 100 miles of an external border (which, because the border includes the Great Lakes, makes Chicago a border town). A revised policy allows Border Patrol and ICE agents to enter previously safe-haven areas such as hospitals, churches, and courts in search of immigrants. And ICE is reportedly planning to use controversial (but legal) big-data technology to target its enforcement priorities.

Worse yet than the terrible legal policies are the lawless actions. ICE agents have, for example, recently—according to ICE itself—unlawfully arrested an individual because he refused to show identification (the detainee’s family disputes whether ICE even requested ID at all). Likewise, they have unconstitutionally demanded that a U.S. citizen submit to their facial-recognition app or be arrested. And ICE is alleged to have denied detainees access to lawyers.

ICE’s acts have also resulted in the illegal detention of more than 150 U.S. citizens. Just recently, one agent was filmed arresting a U.S. citizen based on the suspicion that he was an alien because he had a foreign accent. Other agents wrongly arrested a U.S. citizen and forced him to leave his home dressed only in underwear and a blanket in below-freezing temperatures. Public reports suggest that ICE agents in Minneapolis are searching for Hmong residents. These actions are being conducted despite all constitutional protections to the contrary.

All of this must go. All of it can go. ICE policies can be changed. The laws governing ICE behavior can be revised and strengthened. Agents can be prohibited from entering safe havens; they can be required to show their faces and identify themselves. They can be prohibited from using pepper spray or relying in any way on ethnic indicators, such as appearance, language, and accent, as a basis for their probable cause to arrest. Border Patrol agents can be subjected to stricter geographical restrictions, limited to land borders and, say, a 10-mile corridor. They could, likewise, be statutorily prohibited from performing the enforcement-and-removal function altogether.

Perhaps more fundamentally, ICE agents could, if Congress wishes, be deprived of all criminal-arrest power and the authority to execute judicial warrants. Rather, much as with the TSA officers at screening checkpoints, ICE agents could, by law, be limited to quasi-civil enforcement authorities, such as detention and seizure. The majority of ICE agents could be disarmed.

That said, all the good policies in the world are of no use if they are mere dead letters, gathering dust in the corner. How can anyone ensure that New ICE agents follow the new rules?

Direct enforcement mechanisms through the courts are, we have come to learn, of little practical use. Indeed, as Chief Judge Patrick Schiltz, of the federal district court in Minnesota, has said, “ICE has likely violated more court orders in January 2026 than some federal agencies have violated in their entire existence.” On more than 90 occasions, ICE has ignored the courts. That must change. Court orders are likely to be of greater impact under New ICE because new leadership would demand the adherence of the agents. But even then, there are limits to how much compliance a court can deliver. Ex post review that provides only for ex ante change has proved relatively ineffective.

Instead, New ICE must build (or rebuild) ex post individual accountability for individual-agent misconduct. This can be done in any number of ways: First, as Judge Nancy Gertner has has written, 40 years ago, the Supreme Court said that the exclusionary rule (via which improperly attained evidence can be kept out of court) didn’t apply in immigration proceedings, thus removing any real incentive for ICE to obey the limits of the Fourth Amendment. The Court could revisit that decision. More realistically, Congress could mandate it by statute or the president could do so by executive order. Second, the Court has said that plaintiffs injured by Border Patrol agents may not sue for their injuries, offering a “national security” justification. This, too, can be modified by statute if Congress chooses, or by executive order.

Speaking of Congress, the single most effective thing to advance accountability would be for Congress to discard its supine posture and reinvigorate its crucial oversight functions. Meanwhile, we could also return to a time of robust internal accountability (such as a restored internal-affairs division and a better protected inspector general’s office), including, where appropriate, Department of Justice investigations of alleged criminal activity and, in extreme cases, federal or state criminal prosecution.

Finally, a future president must attempt to change the culture of the organization. Firing bad leaders is one thing, but as any football fan knows, that’s not enough. A new coach needs to imbue the team with a changed character—reformed habits of behavior and, sometimes, wholesale changes in personnel at many levels of the hierarchy.

The new culture would be one focused on ICE’s core mission—supporting national security by conducting high-value investigations of transnational crime and interior immigration-enforcement action against dangerous criminals. The New ICE culture would elevate and enhance its compliance with law, championing policies that are supported by the public. New ICE would forgo broad sweeps in urban environments for targeted enforcement against identified subjects. And a refocused ICE would welcome external accountability and transparency, recognizing that the trust of the American people must be earned, not demanded.

The country needs an ICE. But it does not need this ICE. A New ICE must be built from the ground up. That will require immense political capital and lots of hard work. But if America is ever again to return to the rule of law, it’s an effort that must be undertaken.</div>

On this week’s episode of The David Frum Show, David opens with his thoughts on the reported $500 million-dollar deal between World Liberty Financial, a Trump-family business venture, and the United Arab Emirates, as reported by The Wall Street Journal. David discusses the helplessness we feel as we are bombarded with stories where it seems all restraint has broken down and explains what laws exist that are meant to curtail corrupt practices.

Then, David is joined by former Alberta Premier Jason Kenney to discuss the Trump administration’s overtures to an Albertan secessionist movement, the harm the Trump presidency has done to the American-Canadian alliance, and how Trump is pushing Canada into China’s arms. David and Premier Kenney also discuss how the failures to address immigration by liberal parties across the West have led to dangerous far-right populist movements.

Finally, David discusses The Imperialist, by Sara Jeannette Duncan, and how it can help us better understand what is being lost by Trump’s destruction of the relationship between America and Canada.

The following is a transcript of the episode:

David Frum: Hello, and welcome to The David Frum Show. I’m David Frum, a staff writer at The Atlantic. My guest this week will be Jason Kenney, former premier of the Canadian province of Alberta, former Canadian minister of immigration, former Canadian minister of defense. My book this week will be a 1904 novel by a Canadian writer named Sara Jeannette Duncan, titled The Imperialist, which casts a reflective light on some of the themes of my conversation with Jason Kenney.

Before turning to either, some opening thoughts on an absolutely astonishing story reported by The Wall Street Journal on January 31. According to The Wall Street Journal, four days before Donald Trump was inaugurated as United States president, a United Arab Emirates businessman made a $500 million commitment to invest in one of [the] Trump family’s companies, his cryptocurrency company, a decision that resulted in a payment of $187 million to the Trump family up front and $31 million to the family of Steven Witkoff, the Middle East envoy. The investment, which amounted to $500 million over a period of the deal, made no apparent business sense. The company in which this astonishing half-a-billion-dollar investment was made, that company had almost no products, and its few revenue sources were outside the limit of the deal. It is impossible to understand how any of this could have made any business sense. But the businessman, who is a member of the royal family and a brother of the president of the United Arab Emirates, and who oversees not just his own enormous wealth but the very important state investment fund, committed this vast amount of money to these two families—in return for what?

A potential answer to that question emerged just two months after the $500 million deal. At that point, according to The Wall Street Journal, the Trump administration gave the UAE access to 500,000 a year extremely high-tech computer chips, chips that could help build one of the largest artificial-intelligence data centers in the world. This was a departure from the Biden administration’s approach, which allowed the United Arab Emirates a limited number of chips, due to concerns the chips could make their way to China. So there’s a big deal allowing the United Arab Emirates access to tightly held chips, coming so soon after a $500 million investment into a Trump family entity.

A spokesman for World Liberty told the Journal that President Trump and Steve Witkoff “had no involvement in the deal” and that “the deal didn’t grant either party involved any sort of access to government decision-making or influence over policy.” White House counsel also told The Wall Street Journal—and I am quoting again—“The President has no involvement in business deals that would implicate his constitutional responsibilities”; that’s the end of that quote. Next quote: nd Witkoff “has not and does not participate in any official matters that could impact his financial interests.” This is an astonishing story, a disturbing story, a story with implications not only for U.S. public integrity but for United States national security.

I’m not gonna comment more on the story because the story is much discussed already. (Laughs.) You will have your own thoughts about its meaning and implications. I wanna talk about the feeling of helplessness that this story leaves behind. I think a lot of Americans read things like this and just say, What can we do? The Donald Trump administration, there’s story after story that seemingly attests to corruption on a scale never seen not just in American history, but in the history of any democratic country. You get big corruption, billion-dollar corruption, in authoritarian societies with unfree presses. But where the press is free, where the parliament or congress is open, normally, there is some restraint on this kind of behavior by high officials. But in the United States, over the past year and a bit of the second Trump administration, all the restraints seem to have broken down; there seem to be no rules at all.

The New York Times has estimated that the Trump family has made over $1 billion in this first year-plus of the Trump administration. The New Yorker has an update in which they estimate the Trump family’s stake at $4 billion. Whatever the actual number is, again, it is an astonishing sum never before seen in the history not just of the United States, but of any pure democracy, and such things are unimaginable, or have never happened before. And we’re left feeling, What can we do? And the thing I wanna stress here is that, while the laws are dormant, they are not dead. There are recourses that can be had—not immediately, because we have this broken Department of Justice and a supine Congress, but soon. There are relevant statutes that bear upon what seems to have happened here between the Trump family, the Witkoff families, and the United Arab Emirates.

Now, let me first remind you that the United States, it seems hard to believe, but it actually does have a law governing public corruption. It’s Title 18 of the United States Code, Section 201. And I’m going to read from the United States Department of Justice explainer of 201. This is on the United States Department of Justice website. It hasn’t been taken down yet. They’ve left it up. They may wanna take it down later, but I’m going to read some relevant passages from it to you now.

“Section 201 of Title 18 is entitled ‘Bribery of public officials and witnesses.’ The statute,” says the DOJ, “comprises two distinct offenses … and in common parlance only the first of these is true ‘bribery.’”

“The first offense, codified in section 201(b), prohibits the giving or accepting of anything of value to or by a public official, if the thing is given ‘with intent to influence’ an official act, or if it is received by the official ‘in return for being influenced.’”

“The second offense … concerns what are commonly known as ‘gratuities’ … Section 201(c) prohibits that same public official from accepting the same thing of value, if he does so ‘for or because of’ any official act, and prohibits anyone from giving any such thing to him for such a reason.”

Now, the Supreme Court has sharply limited the application of sections 201, both the section on bribery and the section on gratuities. But it remains against the law for someone, anyone, and a public official—and a Middle East envoy is also a public official—for anyone who is a public official—and a president is a public official—to give or do anything, any official act, in exchange for something of value. If that’s what’s happened here, that is a crime. It remains a crime. And it’s a crime that, even if the Trump administration chooses not to act on it today, has a statute of limitations of five years from the last act necessary to complete the crime. If some future Department of Justice, some future prosecutor, were to deem that payment unlawful or an effort to influence the behavior of the United States government, from the day that the last payment is due, there’s five years in which an action could be brought. It is not hopeless. The law is not dead; it is just dormant.

And meanwhile, there’s another legal wrinkle that I invite people—imagine that the United States will again have a more active Department of Justice and a more independent Congress—to bear in mind, which is the United Emirates officials who made this purchase, whatever its purpose—and, again, we’re not gonna use legal language here; we’re mindful that nothing has been proven, but the facts are suggestive—they are exposed to something even more formidable, which is, in 2016, the United States Congress passed and President Barack Obama signed a measure called the Global Magnitsky [Human Rights Accountability] Act.

This act, named for a murdered Russian businessman, Sergei Magnitsky, gives the president, and the president alone, considerable power to act against non-U.S. entities and persons deemed to be active in global corruption. Under the Global Magnitsky Act, a future American president can take sanctions against any entity or any person—a businessman or any friend controlled by the businessman—and can impose the following: economic sanctions, including asset blocking and prohibitions on transactions. They can freeze any property held within U.S. jurisdiction and prohibit U.S. individuals or entities from entering into transactions with the designated person or entity. And they can impose visa restrictions to deny entry to the United States and revoke any already-issued visas to any person that the president of the United States, under the Global Magnitsky Act, by executive action, deems to have participated in significant global corruption. So there is a lot of exposure here. There are a lot of remedies at hand. There are tools. And the fact that those tools are not being used today does not mean that they cannot be used tomorrow.

Now, Trump and those around him understand the danger to them as well or better than I do or than you now do. That could be one of the reasons why Donald Trump is so panicky to ensure that, by any means necessary, he retains control of Congress, both houses, in 2026 and why he so covets a third term: because only by overthrowing the electoral system of the United States can he feel that he has security from some of the legal risks to which he might be exposed if the implications of these latest reports turn out to be valid and true. For Donald Trump, he may feel that his alternatives are power or prison. And for the rest of us, those feelings of Donald Trump should be a beacon to remind ourselves that the law is alive; the law matters, that things that you think of as shocking and outlandish and impossible and un-American, other people have thought about them before you and have taken measures to make sure that they don’t happen and that, if they do, they are punished.

Punishment for crime is not something that just happens to 5-year-old people who have overstayed their visas or who never had a visa in the first place. Punishment for crime is something that can happen to the most powerful people in the land. And indeed, it’s more called for against the most powerful than it is against the least powerful because it is the most powerful who are also the most dangerous. They have the greatest responsibility. They have the greatest visibility. They have the greatest position of trust. They have the least excuse for using their power to benefit and enrich themselves, and to plunder the Treasury, and to put American national security at risk.

Again, this is a news report. There is more to be learned. None of this has been proven in court. But it oughta be tested in court. And let’s hope that if the American people are allowed the right to make their voices heard freely and fairly in 2026 and 2028, it will be tested in court in due time and by the executive actions allowed by the Global Magnitsky Act.

Frum: Jason Kenney served as premier of the province of Alberta from 2019 through 2022, leading the province through the shock of the COVID pandemic. He held, previously, major offices in the federal Conservative cabinets of Prime Minister Stephen Harper, including as minister of citizenship and immigration and as minister of national defense.

This listing of jobs does not begin to do justice to Jason Kenney’s importance to Canadian politics over the past two decades. More than any other Canadian politician, Jason Kenney built the Canadian Conservatives into a truly multiethnic party, competitive among Canadians of every origin, whether South Asian, East Asian, Afro Caribbean, or from the traditional immigration sources in Europe.

Since leaving politics, Jason Kenney has worked as a corporate director and adviser, and a senior fellow at two Canadian think tanks: the free-market C. D. Howe Institute and Cardus, an institution that applies Christian teaching to industrial relations.

I’ve known Jason Kenney since his days as head of the Canadian [Taxpayers] Federation, a long, long time ago, in a very different world, and it’s a pleasure to welcome (Laughs.) Jason to The David Frum Show. Jason, thank you for joining me.

Frum: So let’s start by talking about some very Alberta-specific things that have been much in the news recently, which is that the Trump administration seems to be trying to foment an Alberta secessionist movement as a preliminary to annexing either the province of Alberta solo or the entire country of Canada. Can you help the non-Canadians among us understand what’s going on here? Why would the Trump people be trying to break up Canada and grab a piece of it?

Kenney: Well, as you know, the annex Canada stuff started in December, after the last U.S. election, when [Trump] was visited by [then-Prime Minister] Justin Trudeau at Mar-a-Lago. And [he] apparently used this line, Fifty-first state, you’ll be the governor, as a joke, to which Trudeau responded, and he saw that he rumbled Canadians; it got a lot of attention. And I think it suddenly became a new squeeze toy for the president-elect. So he spent much of December and January of last year toying with this idea, to the point where a year ago, he was asked, Mr. President, would you use military force, as you have threatened to do with Panama and Greenland, to annex Canada and make it the 51st state? And he said, No, I don’t need to do that; I will just use economic force. And that became a pretty consistent rhetorical theme, which was then followed in February, March of last year with the imposition of prejudicial tariffs on Canada, treating us as though we were as large a source of narcotics and illegal migration as Mexico, which is, of course, patently absurd. And it’s been a very bumptious relationship ever since.

Concurrent with that, we’ve had an emerging—well, there’s been a marginal separatist movement in the province of Alberta for five decades, rooted in historical alienation but really amplified by the 10 years of Justin Trudeau’s premiership, which was really problematic for Alberta’s large oil-and-gas industry. And my successor, the current premier, has enabled, through a much more accessible citizens’ initiative referendum process, a referendum that looks likely to happen later this year. And so people in the Trump administration, and certainly MAGA influencers, are now toying with that: Perhaps if Canada is not willing to be annexed, Alberta is.

Now, Alberta’s always had a large history of American immigration. Southern Alberta was settled by farmers and ranchers from the upper Midwest. The oil industry was often populated by American professionals. And so there are closer connections, and in many cultural and economic ways, those connections are very durable. But the vast majority of Albertans have no interest in this, but some of these marginal separatist leaders have been paying visits to Washington and apparently meeting with Trump administration officials. That’s been confirmed now by the Financial Times. And [U.S. Treasury Secretary] Scott Bessent recently intimated that, If [Canadian Prime Minister] Mark Carney doesn’t watch his manners and mind his p’s and q’s, perhaps we’ll invite Alberta to be part of the United States.

So you see this kind of growing momentum. And I think it’s time for Prime Minister Carney, if he’s not already done so, to telegraph some very strong messages that this is one red line that cannot be crossed; it would result in significant sanctions. And I think we should start—and perhaps this is partly what Prime Minister Carney’s Davos speech was about—start building a Denmark-style coalition, which was very effective in forcing Trump’s 180 on Greenland. I don’t think we should overheat this yet, but they need to know that if they actually play in this space and start making offers of debt forgiveness and lines of credit and all this nonsense, or actually offering prospective-state status for Canada, that that will be a bridge too far.

Frum: Let me just go a little slower through what you just said, because some of this may be a little insider-y for any non-Canadians listening. It’s when Trump and Bessent and others talk about annexing Alberta that there is a mechanism by which they could really make trouble. There is a scheduled referendum. The legal status of this referendum is very hazy; Quebec has had two referendums, and the Canadian Supreme Court has imposed very stringent conditions on whether those referendums would mean anything. But Alberta does have one. There is an opportunity to make real trouble if an American administration were minded to do it, and it sounds like this administration is, with a view to breaking up Canada, detaching Alberta, which is the most oil-wealthy part of Canada, and seizing it as an American Puerto Rico or other territory of some kind.

Kenney: Yeah, I don’t think there’s any realistic prospect of actually making Alberta a U.S. state. It would require, obviously, a constitutional amendment. And by the way, the sane Republicans would pretty quickly calculate that Alberta, even though it’s the most conservative province in Canada, would most likely send, reliably, two Democrat senators to Washington. So it actually doesn’t make sense in American partisan political terms.

But you’re right—Trump has often said he needs nothing from Canada; he wants nothing from us. And yet he’s always wanted to get Keystone XL built, the prospective enlarged pipeline from Alberta to the U.S. Gulf Coast. Context, as you’ve said, is that Alberta has the third-largest proven and probable oil reserves in the world, 180 billion barrels of accessible crude reserves, and the third-largest natural gas reserves. We are by far the largest supplier of imported oil to the United States. Any given year, 60 to 65 percent of U.S. oil imports come from Alberta; that’s 10 times what you import from Saudi Arabia and five times from all of OPEC combined. And for all of the noise around Venezuela’s famous reserves, which, like Alberta’s, are very heavy and therefore the right kind of product for a lot of the U.S. Gulf Coast refineries, the truth is we have a well-developed industry. We are producing 6 million barrels a day, unlike Venezuela, at 800,000 a day, and given the technology and human capital in Canada, [it’s] much easier to increase that. So this notion that Venezuela is suddenly going to become the major source, I think, is a misdirect. If he was actually thinking in avaricious terms, as he tends to, Alberta would be an obvious target.

Frum: So a couple of points to amplify here: The United States, of course, is now by far the world’s largest producer of oil and gas; it is net-net totally self-sufficient in petroleum products. But the United States imports certain products from Canada, certain heavier grades of oil, to meet the needs of certain refineries, even though overall the United States is not an importer. And then it exports other things, so while it’s a net exporter, there’s a category of imports from Canada.

I often think, when people make this comparison between Canada and Venezuela, I think about the offer to an oil-industry executive. You wanna get more of this kind of heavy oil that comes from either Canada or Venezuela, so you have two places to put your net investment for your marginal return: one, a place with a long history (Laughs.) of confiscations, nationalizations, kidnappings, murders, guerrilla warfare, no electricity, in the jungle; or the other place, where you can stay at a Westin hotel overnight and drive out in perfect safety to the fields, where there are no murders, no kidnappings, (Laughs.) no guerrilla warfare, and lots of electricity.

Kenney: Exactly. I’ve often made the comparison with other sources of U.S. imports, which is you don’t have to park a U.S. naval fleet off the northwest coast of British Columbia to guarantee security of supply. So we’re the obvious partner. And, David, when I was premier, I actually helped to de-risk—that was, provide government financing and loan guarantees—to get the Keystone XL project done because it makes perfect sense for us to be selling more to the United States. It would be good for both parties. But Trump has had this bizarre contradiction where he says he doesn’t want anything from Canada, doesn’t need our energy; yet he’s wanted a Keystone XL. That would add upwards of a million barrels a day. Despite all of the rumbling from Trump, that would be a longer-term project; we should pursue it. But the point is that all of this, I think, in the back of his confusing mind—I am concerned, at least, and many others are, that if we do end up with a referendum on Alberta separation later this year, that that’s an invitation for a great deal of mischief from President Trump.

Frum: Well, the precedent here would be the 2015 referendum on Scottish independence from the United Kingdom, where malign Russian actors do seem to have played a very big role in trying to promote the breakup of the United Kingdom, with a view to making Scotland some kind of adversarial entity. As I understand it, the British submarine fleet is based in Scotland, so if Scotland were to withdraw from the United Kingdom, it would make it harder for Britain to be a nuclear power. And the Scottish referendum failed, but a lot of mischief was done, and now the United States seems interested in repeating this playbook against Canada, only with the United States in the role of [President Vladimir] Putin’s Russia.

Kenney: And the complicating factor is that some of the separatist leaders here have been quite clear that they actually prefer U.S. state status, as opposed to that of an independent nation, because the whole Alberta independence project is rooted in totally understandable frustration with Ottawa. Some of this is rooted in Canadian history. Alberta [and] our neighboring, resource-rich province Saskatchewan, which happens to be the largest source of potash in the world and the second-largest source of uranium, these two provinces were created as a bit of an afterthought in confederation and had a history of being sort of mercantilist outposts for central Canada, so that’s part of our history, amplified by the recent Trudeau government.

So people are using this as a kind of opportunity to express their frustration; that’s understandable.But the notion of turning Alberta into a landlocked statelet, where people would have to get a work permit to go and work in British Columbia or other provinces in Canada—Albertans are fundamentally patriotic. They’re happy to sing “O Canada” at the hockey games. They’ve migrated to the province from elsewhere in the country. Their kids have served in the RCMP [Royal Canadian Mounted Police] or the military very often. So there’s a fundamental attachment to Canada. And yet the separatists, who are kind of confused in their ultimate goal—some of them are suggesting they can get a sweetheart deal from Donald Trump that will forgive our debts, give us some line of credit, facilitate our exit from the country. And for a fairly small portion of our population, that’s actually a seductive proposition.

Frum: Yeah. Let’s put this in the context of a larger U.S.-Canada relationship. Now, one of the things that’s so bizarre about the Trump era is, as you know and as I know, until Donald Trump, you could not get Americans to pay any attention to the U.S.-Canada relationship whatsoever. It was, Canada, friendly neighbor to the north. It could not be a more boring subject, because things just hummed along. I’ve given talks to audiences of Canadian officeholders, where they would say, What do we do to get more attention from the United States? And I’d always say, Why do you want that? If you have kids (Laughs.) and you’ve driven them [on] any long road trip in a car, you know there’s one kid in the corner who’s reading their comic book, not bothering anybody, and there’s another kid who’s kicking the mom’s seat.

Frum: (Laughs.) You’d rather be the kid in the corner reading the comic book than kicking Mom’s seat. But now there is this enormous attention, and where does it come from? What is the possible basis for why Donald Trump has decided that Canada is, maybe after Denmark, America’s leading geopolitical problem that must be crushed by military force?

Kenney: No idea how it developed, because it wasn’t the case in his first term. It was never part of his public rhetoric. I think he barely ever mentioned Canada in his last campaign, in ’24. And a lot of people hypothesized that it was just that he was irritated by Justin Trudeau, but Trudeau’s long gone now. In fact, Trudeau’s exit was accelerated by all of these Trump threats. It sort of focused the mind in the Liberal Party and our politics more generally that we needed somebody capable of dealing with Trump and his threats. I don’t know why President Trump didn’t say, Look, I helped you Canadians get rid of this clown Trudeau. But he’s continued these erratic threats.

And most recently, for example, David, Prime Minister Carney welcomed Donald Trump’s invitation for Canada to diversify our trade relations and so went to Beijing, like most historic U.S. allies are doing right now, to repair relations with the People’s Republic of China and made a fairly limited tariff deal to lower Canadian tariffs on electric-vehicle imports in exchange for lowering Chinese tariffs on—or, effectively, a blockade on some Canadian ag exports. So Trump, when presented with this, said, Good for Carney. He should do this. He should make deals. I make deals; he should make deals. Then Carney gave his speech at Davos, which I thought was a fairly persuasive argument about how middle powers should work together to deal with this destabilizing threat. But I think what happened was Trump was furious at being upstaged by Prime Minister Carney at Davos and so immediately threatened 100 percent tariffs in response to Canada’s China deal.

So from day to day, we just don’t know where this is going. We have the renegotiation of USMCA [United States–Mexico–Canada Agreement] coming up this summer, a deal that Trump once called the greatest trade deal in world history, which Jamieson Greer, the U.S. trade rep, and [Secretary of Commerce] Howard Lutnick have suggested they don’t need, they’re just going to tear up. For their second-largest trading partner—and Canada is the most important trading partner for 24 of the 50 United States; as I say, by far the largest source of energy; the only source of fertilizer for your farmers; totally integrated economies in many respects. And we are now being forced to do things we don’t want to do, like reengaging the PRC on a bunch of issues.

Frum: Okay, let me just underscore what happened with that PRC deal. So the Biden administration, I think—I forget the year, ’23 or ’24—wanted to put big tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles and thought it would be much more effective if there were a united North American front on this issue. The North American electric-vehicle industry is disproportionately located in the United States. Canada signed up and imposed exactly the same tariff on Chinese vehicles that the United States did, at the American request. The Chinese delayed their retaliation for a while and then, very cunningly, took disproportionate revenge on Canada, recognizing Canada as the weaker link, who got less from the tariffs and were more exposed. They imposed penalties on Canadian agricultural experts that were very, very painful to Canada and that Canada absorbed as part of its alliance with the United States.

And when Donald Trump came along and Howard Lutnick, who seems to be the designated blabber of this administration, and said, We’re gonna take the entire automobile industry away from Canada and relocate the North American automobile industry entirely to the United States, Canadians naturally thought, Why should Canada suffer these agricultural punishments to protect a North American industry that the Americans are now proposing to take away from Canada? In that case, why not at least sell agricultural exports to China? And that was the origin of the deal, is Canada said, Canada will reduce its tariffs on Chinese EVs in exchange for some relief on Canadian agricultural exports to China. And this was a war that Canada did not start, Canada did not want, Canada volunteered to join, and that Canada took disproportionate pain for participating in.

Kenney: All of that’s correct. To be clear, you know I’m one of the original China hawks in Canadian politics, so I don’t like the deal. It has all sorts of add-ons. Of course, the Chinese insisted that it be framed as a “strategic partnership.” It includes strategic cooperation on policing, on media, lots of bizarre things—the kind of nastiness that the Chinese require if you want access to their market in the long run. I don’t like this.

And let me just say this, David: I think one of the great, perhaps accidental, achievements of the first Trump administration was his resetting the Western policy paradigm on China, something that the Biden administration continued and, in fact, amplified. And Canada, by the way, David, it’s not the first time we’ve been through this, having to pay a trade price with China for being loyal American allies. Several years ago, we, at the request of the United States Department of Justice, detained the daughter of the CEO of Huawei, who was charged in the U.S. with various kinds of fraud and embezzlement. And in response, the Chinese kidnapped a couple of our diplomats, detained them for years, and slammed an embargo on a bunch of our major Canadian exports—again, agricultural products.

So I think they’re entirely unreliable, and I keep telling Canadian exporters, If you think this is a reliable market, wait until [Chinese President] Xi [Jinping] launches his planned invasion or blockade of Taiwan and we all have to stop exporting to them. So I think it’s very regrettable, but here’s the point: President Trump had an opportunity, I think, to double down on the new Western policy setting towards the PRC by creating a free-trade alliance against unfair Chinese trading practices, industrial espionage, political interference, territorial aggression, and all of that. Instead, he has inexplicably done the opposite by creating a rupture in the historic political and trade alliances of the United States, forcing Europe, Canada, and others to turn back towards China and reverse the progress that he had made in isolating China, to some extent, in his first administration. So I don’t know how these guys like Elbridge Colby at the Defense Department, these people who have given some veneer of intellectual respectability to Trump’s geopolitical strategy, feel when, in fact, he’s doing the opposite of their stated intent.

Frum: So the situation that President Trump inherited in 2025 was a lot of mood in Canada that said, We want to cooperate more closely with the United States for protection against a common threat. And what Carney’s trip to China represented was Canadians saying, or at least the important parts of Canada, including the prime minister and his government saying, We’ve decided that, of these two threats, the more immediately dangerous is the United States, not China anymore. That’s quite an achievement.

Kenney: It is, and we’re not the only ones—you’ve seen the train of European leaders beating a path to the door of Beijing recently. It’s so terribly unfortunate and counterproductive for the interests of the United States.

And by the way, Trump made his own tariff deal with them. He’s given them access to advanced Nvidia chips to help them catch up to the United States in the AI arms race. And he says he wants a megadeal—he admires Xi, and whether Xi invades Taiwan is up to Xi. So we’re watching this, saying, You’re gonna impose 100 percent tariffs on us for a minor sectoral tariff deal when you want a grand bargain with the same country. It’s very hard for us, like other U.S. allies, to unpack how to deal with all of this.

Frum: Well, let me ask you about your former portfolio: national defense. So Canada has been, admittedly, a defense laggard for a long time. That now seems to be changing. And there was a program, over many years, to make a major Canadian commitment to American airframes for defense of the skies over Canada and the Arctic. And that now is one of the potential casualties of the Trump-created crisis. Talk a little bit about what’s happening to the U.S.-Canada defense and especially to the F-35 fighter program.

Kenney: Well, first, some context: Canada, as you know, used to have a very robust post-war military—we had played an oversized role in the Second [World] War and in the first half of the Cold War. My dad was a Canadian fighter jet pilot in those days. We had a very robust Arctic defense through NORAD [North American Aerospace Defense Command]. But regrettably, since [Canadian Prime Minister] Pierre Trudeau’s administration, there’s been this drawdown in our defense. We, like the European countries, took a very big peace dividend and ended up averaging 1.5 percent defense expenditure on GDP for the past, let’s say, 25 years, although we did punch above our weight again in Afghanistan, demonstrating our reliability as an ally.

Now, credit where it’s due, Donald Trump’s been right about calling on his allies to pay their dues on alliance defense, and so Mark Carney has responded remarkably, with a commitment to go from roughly 1.5 percent to 2 percent to 3.5 percent, with an outlined commitment to go above that. So we’re doing this huge defense enlargement. Predating that was this commitment to replace our fighter jet fleet. It was a long and protracted process that settled on the F-35, and almost all defense experts in Canada will agree it is the best platform for us, in part because of the interoperability with the U.S. and other allied F-35 fleets. So we’re committed to buying 88 of those. The first tranche of 16 will be arriving in the next 18 months. And that’s all good, but with the Trump threat, suddenly, we’re looking at our major defense supplier moving from being our greatest ally to, in some respects, hostile. And as you know, Trump has said, on the next-generation fighter, they’re going to ensure that foreign purchasers get a less-capable grade than the United States Air Force does. So we’re now wondering, Are we exposing ourselves to some kind of vulnerability, about which we are unaware, if our entire air force is dependent on American support, American parts, American political goodwill?

And so I think Mark Carney has, quite prudently, while proceeding with the initial tranche of the F-35 purchase, launched a review about our broader air force needs. And there is a view, which I think is not irrational, that perhaps we should purchase a smaller fleet of 35s and then look at a European platform, like the Gripen from Sweden, to complement that. Again, most defense hawks here want the full F-35 purchase. The argument is we could buy a lot more frames from the Swedes, which are, in some respects, more operable in the Arctic because they can take off short landing strips, gravel landing strips, and so forth. So there is an argument, and I think it’s worth having. It is enraging Trump’s ambassador in Ottawa, who is the most ineffective and unpopular U.S. ambassador, I think, in history here. But I think it’s only natural that we should at least take a look at this.

Frum: Yeah. By the way, how easy a job is it to be U.S. ambassador to Canada? How much does everybody like you and want to see you? How welcome are you [in] every business community? To screw that up, that takes a kind of perverse genius.

Kenney: Especially for this guy, [Pete] Hoekstra, who is a Dutch immigrant to the United States, whose family was liberated from the Nazis in Holland by the First Canadian Army in 1944.

Frum: Well, let’s talk about these airframes. I was in Norway at the beginning of last year, where there was a vigorous similar debate about what kind of frigate platform to buy. And there were a number of choices: There was an American choice, which was, by all accounts, the most capable but also the most expensive, and there were choices from other countries as well. And the Norwegians had been in advanced talks to purchase—they’re a Russian neighbor, they’ve had a lot of Russian aggression in their waters, they’re very wealthy because of their oil resources, and there was a lot of inclination to buy the American platform, the most expensive but the best. And after Trump made his comment about, We’re going to put a kill switch on U.S. equipment, the Norwegians flipped and realized, We don’t need the best frigate in the world. We’re not gonna fight the Americans. We need a frigate that’s better than the Russian frigate. And the British frigate is better than the Russian frigate, cheaper, and now more secure. And they ended by buying a fleet of British frigates rather than [American], not as a punitive measure, but because they could no longer trust the American product to be consistent with their self-defense and sovereignty.

Kenney: That’s a precise echo of the debate we’re having now on the Gripen. Look, as a former defense minister, all of the guys I worked with would want me to be unqualifiedly committed to going the full distance on the F-35 because of the capability of that platform. I understand it, but I do think it’s prudent to look at, For every incremental F-35, could we buy two or more Gripens that would be perfectly adequate for our needs, complementing a core F-35 fleet? It’s a debate worth having, but it’s only happening—it’s only happening—because of the instability that Trump has imposed in this relationship.

Frum: Let me ask you now about your other portfolio, citizenship and immigration, which in Canada is one of the most important portfolios in the government because Canada is such an immigration country and continues to be. You won’t say this, so let me say it for you: You were not just a minister; you were the leader of a comprehensive political transformation of the Conservative Party, where I can’t begin to imagine how many Lunar New Years, weddings, funerals, bar mitzvahs, dedication ceremonies you went to and what a toll it took on you personally, psychically to do it, but—

Frum: (Laughs.) And you learned greetings—

Kenney: My nickname was the “minister of curry in a hurry” because I would do as many as five curry banquets in a night. (Laughs.)

Frum: (Laughs.) And you’d record greetings in Vietnamese and in Punjabi and in Italian. And you did this while Canada was simultaneously expanding its immigration intake, but also upping the quality in terms of human skills of the immigrants it took.

Now, that was a while ago. Since then, we’ve had the Syrian civil war, which sent a lot of refugees into Europe in ways that have been very destabilizing to European politics. We’ve had the Brexit referendum, where Britain made, in my opinion, the self-harming choice to leave the European Union, in part because of fear of the consequences of the migration into Europe of the refugees that came in 2015, or the so-called refugees. And now we’ve had two terms of Trump. You’re one of the leaders of Canadian intellectual, capital-C and lowercase-c, conservatism. How should conservatives in Canada and elsewhere—in the United States, in Britain, in the West—think about immigration now? And you speak as someone with this history of being a leading advocate of immigration. How does it look to you today in light of the past decade of developments?

Kenney: Well, let me say that people like Reihan Salam at the Manhattan Institute and scholars around the world have said that Canada’s Harper-era immigration policy was really a model of immigration policy for a developed country. In the late ’60s, Canada developed the point system, which was essentially a human-capital model, to select economic immigrants based on an analysis of their language ability, education, adaptability, their age— more points for younger immigrants—etc. This did significantly change the composition of our immigration, from post-war, it was more typically blue-collar Europeans, to white-collar people from the developing world became the predominant economic immigrants.

And it worked very well, but it was starting to—there were problems in it. There were integrity issues, large numbers of fake asylum claims, human smuggling, lots of kinds of fraud, and a degrading of the system. So I went through—you’re absolutely right—several years of a rigorous reform, which really, I think, created an optimal system. We had robust but manageable levels. On a population of 33 million, we were admitting about a quarter of a million people a year. And there was a broad public consensus: 80 percent support. Canada was the only developed democracy, with the possible exception of Australia, which had broad cross-partisan support for immigration generally.

And then, unfortunately, Justin Trudeau, with his typical liberal naivete, which was given a kind of veneer of intellectual respectability by business-interest groups, said, Canada needs a population of 100 million as soon as possible—pressure from the business community, as always, for more access to foreign labor. A bunch of these pressures had Canada quadrupling, quintupling intake levels: huge intake of low-skilled guest workers, huge intake of poorly qualified foreign students at dodgy diploma mills. And then, concurrently, Trudeau basically invited anybody from the United States who had a failed asylum claim to come up here. That’s cratered the asylum system. And all of this in the face of a housing crisis, a crisis in access to health care and other public services, and stagnating incomes for people—as you’ve often pointed out, David, high levels of sustained, low-skilled immigration inevitably reduce per-capita GDP, and Canada has been on a multiyear decline in per-capita GDP. All of this has accelerated our reduction in competitiveness and productivity. I think it’s perhaps the worst legacy of the Trudeau decade.

And so it’s really regrettable, and now we have seen, quite predictably, that broad pro-immigration consensus—which I was always mindful that it wasn’t something we could take for granted; we had to demonstrate that immigration was a net positive for the country—that has now frayed, and public support for immigration has turned upside down. So the Carney government is trying to get some of this back on track. But it is a concern, and it’s a reminder that even a model system with broad support is conditional and it can be upended overnight.

Frum: So you may be a little reluctant to speak about the American context, but let me ask an American question, and you take it where you wanna go.

So under President [Joe] Biden, the American asylum system just collapsed. A system that was designed to welcome Anne Frank’s family from Germany, Hungarians fleeing the Soviet crackdown in 1956, that’s what the asylum system is for. And it became, basically, a backup immigration system for those who had no other way to get into the United States, and hundreds of thousands of people came into the United States until Biden’s last year, when he course-corrected. And this doesn’t seem to have been so much a policy as the absence of a policy, driven by veto-wielders who were important to the Biden coalition.

So this does tremendous damage to Biden’s standing, and it helps to reelect Donald Trump in 2024. And now we have paramilitaries (Laughs.) running the streets of Minneapolis and American citizens being gunned down by poorly trained Border Patrol, who have no business being inside an American city. And it seems like there has been this veering from one crazy extreme to an even crazier and more murderous extreme on the other hand. What should politicians and people who are trying to be prudent, who lean conservative—how should they think about any of this?

Kenney: It is tragic, and I do think you’re right that Biden and the left of the Democrat Party, who dominated his domestic policy agenda, bear a lot of the burden for what’s happened in the United States. I’ll remind you that people like Marco Rubio tried to get a comprehensive immigration settlement in the United States, which made a lot of sense—which was basically what [President Ronald] Reagan did. But I recall meeting with Janet Napolitano when she was secretary of homeland security about cooperating on stopping illegal border crossings from the U.S. into Canada. I was looking for an agreement to help us…send back, illegal border crossers. And she said, Look, we can’t do anything until we have comprehensive agreement in Congress, which is, I don’t think—is that at all possible in the United States, David? Is it at all possible? I can’t see, even post-Trump, anybody winning a Republican primary if they have any commitment to regularize long-standing, law-abiding overstayers in the United States. So I think the United States is locked into a permanent catastrophe when it comes to mismanaging immigration.

Frum: But in all the democratic countries, or almost all—in Britain, in Germany, in France—you have parties of the far right that are running on programs of xenophobia, xenophobia that in the United States has turned violent and deadly, and parties of the left that are not able to articulate, What would border security look like in a context of the need for human beings? It looks like 2025 will be the first year since the first American census in 1790 when the population of the United States shrinks. Birth rates in almost every developed country—maybe Israel is the exception—are below replacement, so simply to keep your population stable, you need to bring in people. And of course, you need skills and different human capacities, not all of which occur spontaneously in every country on its own. And there are people who wanna move, which if you want to see human beings be free, if human beings wanna move, you’ll wanna start with, Well, they should be able to if they want to.

So you need to control the borders. You need security. You need not to have police states inside the United States. How do we think about this? What’s the answer? If someone from the moderate side of American politics were to call you and say, What should a post-Trump American immigration policy look like?, what should it look like?

Kenney: Well, the starting point has to be systems characterized by integrity, which is to say with minimal space for illegally regular migration, smuggling, trafficking, mass border crossings. You’re quite right: That means significant reform of our asylum systems. The principal driver of the rise in xenophobic anti-immigrant politics has been large-scale illegal migration. You cannot sustain broad public support for, or demonstrate the net benefits of, regulated immigration if your vast majority of migrants are people who just crash your borders, in the case of Europe, primarily young military-aged men, coming from problematic source countries with a history of violence and with very poor integration results—let’s be honest. The people who are voting AfD [Alternative for Democracy] and for the Le Pens and for [U.K. politician] Nigel Farage, they are observing things happening in their communities that are unpleasant, that are disruptive of social cohesion. It’s not xenophobic or racist to note that. It’s necessary for mainstream politicians to be serious about dealing with those challenges, as, for example, the Aussies were, very effectively, in stopping illegal marine migration and, as I would argue, we were in the Harper government in stopping some of this.

So I think a shared commitment, left to right—like the Danish government, a social-democratic government, has been very hardheaded about these things and has avoided the emergence of a xenophobic alt-right. So I think, from the center left to the center right, we need to be a little more hardheaded and a little less softhearted when it comes to those issues.

Secondly, maximizing human capital when it comes to the selection of economic immigrants so you get more bang for the economic buck from the newcomers that you welcome. If immigration is nothing but a tool for large businesses to commodify labor and to, consequently, suppress wage levels for lower-skilled workers, then, again, you’re undermining the economic case for immigration. That means we’re all going to have to, per the Japanese, invest more in automation and coping with shrinking populations. That, I think, is inevitable.

Frum: And at the same time, a rule of law governing the immigration-enforcement apparatus within a country, because you can’t have these paramilitary forces roaming the streets of cities masked.

Kenney: Of course you can’t. But on the other hand, you can’t be overly sentimental about this either, David, if you’re gonna have a system with integrity. In the case of Canada, for example, our version of ICE, the Canada Border Services Agency, is resourced and they only do about 13,000 removals a year. Because of the overhang from the Trudeau catastrophe in mismanaging the system, we probably have 3 million, going on 4 million people who are falling out of status who are now here illegally, and that population is going to keep growing. If you don’t deal with it, what’s the point of having an orderly system?

Frum: A more legal process, a warm welcome, and the rule of law.

Kenney: It’s not mysterious what we need to do.

Frum: As you see the rise of these xenophobic parties, is there any space for the kind of politics that you’re talking about?

Kenney: Right now, it’s hard to conceive of that, isn’t it? You see this huge momentum from the august British Tories, the most successful party in the history of the democratic world, towards reform, driven largely by these issues; this momentum from the Aussie Liberals to One Nation. Canada, David, is perhaps one of the only major democracies where we do not see—yet—the rise of that kind of xenophobic politics.

And I would like to say to my friends on the Canadian left, who are sometimes hysterical about the populism of Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre—look, I think his populism is largely stylistic. It’s basically focusing on the concerns of ordinary working people. Pierre Poilievre’s populism is, Let’s focus on issues like the cost of living, the cost of food, and lock up really bad, violent repeat criminals. And let’s keep immigration levels at a manageable level, where we can properly integrate people. That’s Pierre Poilievre’s populism. If you don’t like that populism, then take a look at what’s happening in the U.K., Australia, Germany, France, and elsewhere. We have a party like that, which Mr. Poilievre has been very effective at pushing out to the margins—the People’s Party of Canada—at, like, 1 or 2 percent in the polls. So again, if you don’t like this kind of mainstream fusion of center-right conservatism and sort of stylistic populism that Mr. Poilievre represents, then you’re gonna get something a hell of a lot more problematic in our politics. So I’m grateful to live in a country where we still, despite the disaster of the Trudeau years, have something more like a mainstream center-right conservative consensus in Canadian conservative politics.

Frum: And let me end with this last thought. There has been now a 40-year consensus in Canada in favor of stronger U.S.-Canadian ties. At the beginning, it was quite controversial, but it’s become a position that is held by both of the two big parties and broadly by people across the Canadian political spectrum. That was true from the middle 1980s until the middle 2010s—warmer, closer integration on everything from trade to national security to food and energy and environment. And this is now in jeopardy because of actions by the Trump administration. And the reactions that are being seen in Canada—much as the present U.S. ambassador to Canada blames Canada for flinching every time it gets slapped, let’s not overlook who’s doing the slapping and why the flinching is happening.

Kenney: Yeah, I will confess I’m quite annoyed with many on the Canadian right, who are reflexively blaming Canada, Carney, whatever, for the disrepair of the relationship when it’s entirely the doing of the United States. There is sort of an element on the right of Canadian politics who, actually, in some bizarre sense, admire Trump and his disruptive—because he “owns the libs” and he’s fighting “woke.” And Trudeau built up such animosity that there’s, unfortunately, now a reflex for, as I say, some on the right to blame Canada for all of this, which I think is absurd.

Look, we’re stepping up to our responsibilities on defense in a very significant way. We have been the most important trade ally of the United States for decades. We are the largest source of energy, of fertilizers. We’re natural partners, and we’re prepared to make pragmatic deals with Donald Trump to respond to rational elements of his agenda. So hopefully, saner heads will prevail after he loses at the Supreme Court, I think, on the emergency tariffs and perhaps is chastened at the midterms. Perhaps we can finally get back to some semblance of normalcy in this critical and historic relationship.

Frum: Jason Kenney, thank you so much for joining me today.

Frum: Thanks so much to Jason Kenney for joining me today on The David Frum [Show]. Now, as mentioned, my book this week is a 1904 novel by a writer named Sara Jeannette Duncan, titled The Imperialist. Many of the books I’ve discussed on this program—Jane Eyre, Frankenstein—have been famous classics. I would venture a pretty firm guess that very, very few people who [are] watching or listening to this program have ever read or even heard of the novel The Imperialist, by Sara Jeannette Duncan. But I read it as a young man, it made a big impression on me, and I wanna talk about it today because I think it’s very relevant to my discussion just now with Jason.

Sara Jeannette Duncan was a Canadian-born writer who wrote many, many novels, most of which I have not read, many of them set in India, the country where she settled in after marrying a British civil servant who was responsible for the administration of British rule in India. She wrote one novel about her native Canada, and that is this book, The Imperialist.

Now, the phrase the imperialist today conjures up images of brutality and exploitation. But in 1904, it was a word laden with some irony, but a great deal of idealism. Here’s the story. The story concerns a young man named Lorne Murchison, the son of Scottish immigrants to Canada. He lives in the fictional small town of Elgin, Ontario. And he becomes interested in politics. He makes a trip to Britain, his first, the home that his parents came from, and is inspired by a vision of the grandeur and beauty of the possibilities of a united British empire.

Now, this was a topic much on the minds of people in Britain and the British dominions at the end of the 19th century, in the beginning of the 20th. Sometime in the late 19th century, the economy of the islands of Great Britain was overtaken in size by the United States and Imperial Germany.

But the economy of the British empire as a whole—Britain plus Ireland plus Canada plus Australia plus New Zealand plus South Africa plus India plus the other British dominions and overseas colonies—that entity remained the world’s largest economic unit until during the First World War. And many in that unit were captivated by the idea, What if this economic unit could also become some kind of strategic unit? And they are captivated by a vision of an imperial federation, with a parliament in London, where Britain would be an important partner, but just one, and where Canada and the other dominions would have representation. For Canadians, this was an especially exciting idea because it offered the possibility for Canada to be less vulnerable to its American neighbor and to achieve, with the other countries of the British imperial system, some kind of collective power that Canada on its own lacked.

The novel is not a political treatise. It’s actually really more a study of small-town life, with many ironic comments about class divisions and the sharp ethnic divide between people who came from England and people who came from Scotland; people who worshipped in Anglican and Methodist churches on the one hand, and people who worshipped in Presbyterian churches on the other. And that will be a very particular treat. But this vision of Canadians wrestling with their place in the world, I don’t know that it’s ever been dealt with better in literature than by this one book, written now more than 100 years ago.

And it captured that Canada has long wrestled with this question of, Was Canada to be a country unto itself, small as it was, or was it to be part of something bigger? And again and again and again, Canadians have been attracted by the vision of being part of something bigger—whether it was the British empire before the First World War or before the Second World War, whether it was some kind of transatlantic community of nations, whether it was part of some kind of North American free-trade zone. This has been an idea that has really spoken to not just the practical, but the romantic element of the Canadian mind. And this is an ideal and a vision that has really taken a tremendous pummeling (Laughs.) during the Donald Trump years. And what Americans are hearing from their Canadian friends is not just a shock to Canadians’ economic self-interest, although that’s very real, but a puncturing of a kind of pan-national dream that expressed itself at one point through imperialism and at other points in other ways.

I remember, during the great debate in the middle of the 1980s over the free-trade agreement with the United States, my wife and I were newly married, and we were very engaged in this debate, and both of us were strongly in favor of the free-trade agreement with the United States. At that time, much of the opposition to the agreement came from the literary and artistic community in Canada. And there were many, many statements and open letters and signatories on statements by writers and artists who were against the free-trade agreement. So Danielle and I and some friends organized a signature of writers and artists who were in favor of the agreement, and we put together a very impressive list, and there was an open letter published in the newspapers. And it was to Danielle that fell the job of recruiting the signature of Mavis Gallant, the great writer of Canadian short stories, then living in Paris, and Danielle spoke to her in Paris.

And Mavis Gallant recounted to her a conversation that she had had with one of the leading opponents of the free-trade agreement. I won’t mention him because he’s still alive—I won’t mention the name, but his quote struck me as really quite incisive and profound. He said, What Canada is debating in this choice is whether Canada wants to be a big small country or a small big country. And he saw himself and his fellow opponents of the agreement as advocating being a big small country, kind of a greater Belgium, and those on the other side as wanting Canada to be a small big country, a kind of lesser France or a lesser Britain. And I thought that was a very profound and true insight. And Canadians did find, in their partnership with the United States that has been so intimate since the middle of the 1980s, a way to be a small big country. And Donald Trump’s attacks on Canada’s continued national existence have really changed the grammar and have re-empowered those who, as this incisive opponent of the agreement said, thought of Canada as being instead a big small country.

The future is quite dark for the North American relationship. I think there are people now in their 20s who will carry the memory of the Donald Trump administration with them to the end of the present century and maybe even beyond that. And to understand what has been lost, no one voiced it better than Sara Jeannette Duncan in 1904 in her novel The Imperialist. It’s still in print if you wanna take a look.

            <h2>This Is Not the Kennedy Center</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-02-04</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/2026/02/kennedy-center-closure-arts-democracy/685877/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">On Sunday evening, as stars walked the red carpet at the Grammy Awards, President Trump announced without warning his intention to close and renovate the Kennedy Center. His statement contained scant details, though it did mention that the venue will shut on July 4, “in honor of the 250th Anniversary of our Country,” and reopen in roughly two years—that is, while he’s still in the White House.

The president framed the closure as one urgently necessary to improve what he called a “tired, broken, and dilapidated Center”—although, notably, the venue dramatically expanded its performance space in 2019. Trump’s decision could easily be read as one of petulance or spite: Since he installed himself as the Kennedy Center’s chairman, replaced its president and some board members with ones loyal to him, and added his name to its facade, ticket sales have tanked, and enough artists canceled or turned down engagements that the theater has no 2026–27 season. Even “the President’s Own” U.S. Marine Band dropped a performance there.

Read: Trump’s golden age of culture seems pretty sad so far

But to understand the projected closure—even if temporary—of the Kennedy Center only in its immediate context is to ignore the larger losses that will accompany it. Last month, the composer Philip Glass called off the premiere of his new Symphony No. 15, Lincoln, which the National Symphony Orchestra commissioned six years ago, saying that “the values of the Kennedy Center today are in direct conflict with the message of the Symphony.” Glass’s comment suggests another risk to the nation’s cultural life: that the “new and spectacular Entertainment Complex” Trump promises to build out of the Kennedy Center’s steel and marble won’t represent John F. Kennedy’s cultural legacy—which is to say it will no longer stand for the value of the arts.

The Kennedy Center’s unanticipated absence comes with immediate, tangible consequences for both Washington, D.C., and the country’s cultural landscape. Although the Kennedy Center isn’t the most cutting-edge venue out there—if anything, many would call it stodgy—it has often operated, as The New Yorker’s Katy Waldman has written, as a “tryout theater” where shows can experiment pre-Broadway. It’s also the home and major underwriter of the National Symphony Orchestra and, until recently, the Washington National Opera, two of the largest organizations performing and commissioning new works in what Waldman describes as “endangered national art forms.” Both will surely relocate to other theaters—the opera has already found hosts for its 2027 and 2028 shows—but the precarity and disruption of not having a permanent home are inarguable.

Opera and orchestral performances are expensive to put on, and many see both as examples of what my colleague Gal Beckerman has described as John and Jacqueline Kennedy’s “patrician” taste. Sustaining them at a high level, as the Kennedy Center has done for decades, requires investment and dedication; so does building new audiences for works that can seem old-fashioned. When the Kennedy Center commissions a new composition or opera, it is also a potent reminder that these forms have life beyond Bach and Mozart, and belong to the present as well as the past.

By giving the NSO and WNO a home, the Kennedy Center also buoyed the arts life of Washington, D.C., more deeply than it does by bringing touring shows to the city. Plenty of NSO members teach their instruments on the side, and other classical musicians in the region moonlight as NSO alternates, such that a talented young cellist in D.C. might very easily end up with a teacher who has shared a stage with Yo-Yo Ma. During the orchestra’s summer recess, it performs affordable outdoor-movie play-alongs—Harry Potter with a world-class orchestra!—that are much more approachable than the debut of a Glass symphony. If the institution that made the latter possible vanishes, the former, too, may be gone.

The more significant risk is of a Kennedy Center that no longer channels its namesake’s profound and public belief that democracy and the arts are intertwined. The Kennedys invited artists, musicians, and writers to the White House. Kennedy chose the abstract expressionist painter Elaine de Kooning, rather than someone with a more traditional style, to do his presidential portrait. His speeches on and attention to culture laid the groundwork for the creation of the National Endowment for the Arts, and he agitated for the long-awaited completion of the institution that, after his death, became the Kennedy Center.

In a 1963 speech at Amherst College honoring Robert Frost, Kennedy described creating art as a form of patriotism, regardless of whether the art itself was patriotic. He argued that the “highest duty of the writer, the composer, the artist is to remain true to himself and to let the chips fall where they may. In serving his vision of the truth, the artist best serves his nation.” Trump, who sets great store by personal loyalty, seems uninterested in such an idiosyncratic and potentially eclectic vision.

Kennedy’s ideal of service—“ask not what your country can do for you”—is nowhere in Trump’s second White House. The same holds for Kennedy’s elevated concept of creative duty. Many of Trump’s grievances with the Kennedy Center, as with the Smithsonian, seem aimed at narrowing rather than expanding its artistic capabilities, limiting it to “classical, patriotic, and family-friendly art.” Such demands run directly against the ideal of art emerging from the artist’s inner self, transmitting individual experience rather than serving external mores.

Beyond his programming notes, Trump and the Kennedy Center’s new director, Richard Grenell, reportedly also want it to make more money. Trump has repeatedly claimed that it has been in bad financial condition for years, which its former director disputes. Asking the closest thing the country has to a national theater to concentrate on its earnings endangers any art form with a small audience, while also curtailing ways that such an audience might grow. Consider the current White House’s approach to funding literature: In 2025, the NEA revoked 41 grants it had issued to magazines and small presses, explaining its pivot in standardized terminations that described these organizations’ work as outside the administration’s priorities. Many of these journals and publishers focus on poetry, experimental writing, and literary translation, all precarious forms in need of support.

A country that does not value these sorts of writing is the same as one that does not value opera. It’s a country that doesn’t ask or expect its art to reach out to new audiences or transgress its traditional boundaries, let alone probe visions of the truth that might have little to do with accepted narratives. In order to do any of these things and get their work into the public eye, artists need the stability and support that organizations of all sizes, whether a small poetry journal or the Kennedy Center, offer. Without them, cultural life would narrow philosophically—a shrinkage that Trump appears to want from the arts, so often a source of dissidence. Faced with the prospect of engaging with a cultural sphere that resists his control and his vision, the president would rather, it seems, knock down as much as he can.</div>

            <h2>American Milk Has Changed</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-02-04</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/2026/02/americas-cows-milkfat/685881/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">In recent years, American milk has undergone a quiet transformation. The milk produced by our dairy cows has become creamier and more luscious as breakthroughs in cow genetics and nutrition have pushed the fat component of milk—also known as butterfat—to all-time highs. In 2000, the average dairy cow made 670 pounds of fat in her milk a year; today, she’s making 1,025 pounds. No single trait in dairy cows has improved as rapidly with genomic selection as fat, according to Chad Dechow, a dairy-cattle geneticist at Penn State. It’s a triumph of dairy science.

Lately, though, all is not well in the world of butterfat. Dairy science has arguably made our cows too good too fast at fatmaxxing.

This past fall, butter prices collapsed as a “tsunami” of butterfat inundated the market. “We really have an oversupply right now,” Corey Geiger, the lead economist for dairy at CoBank, told me. The reason is twofold, he explained: U.S. farmers are keeping a near-record number of dairy cows, which are in turn producing milk with a record level of fat. For customers, this oversupply means cheaper butter. For farmers, “it’s going to be a tough year,” Dechow told me. “The farmers take it on the chin.”

Until last autumn’s crash, farmers had every economic incentive to keep pushing the limit on fat. Butter and cheese consumption have been growing steadily since the 1990s, and butterfat prices were sky-high for several years running. When dairy farmers sell milk, they are generally paid not by volume—milk is mostly water, after all—but by the weight of its solid components, primarily fat and protein. More fat plus more protein adds up to a bigger milk check. Although protein, too, has ticked up in milk, fat has proved more responsive to changes in genetics and diet. After hovering for decades around 3.65 percent, milk fat began rising first slowly and then quickly, reaching 4.24 percent in 2024.

“Genetics sets the ceiling, and nutrition determines the floor,” Dechow said. After the first dairy cow’s genome was sequenced in 2009, the industry started raising the genetic ceiling. By marrying DNA markers to the milk-production records of millions of cows, farmers are able to choose bulls for breeding based on the predicted traits—including milk-fat yield—of their future daughters. And when those daughters are born, some farmers once again DNA-test the young cows, keeping only the ones with the most potential. This precise level of selection has allowed the high-butterfat versions of milk genes to spread far and wide in the American dairy herd over just a few generations. Genetics explains about half to two-thirds of the rise in butterfat levels, experts told me.

For a cow to meet her genetic butterfat potential, though, she needs the right diet. “Cows do not make milk fat from thin air,” Kevin Harvatine, a dairy nutritionist at Penn State, told me. A modern cow’s dietary intake is precisely managed, down to the length of plant fibers optimal for digestion. Even the crops they eat—low-lignin alfalfa, high-oleic soybeans—have been genetically modified or bred to stimulate high milk and milk-fat production in a cow’s body. Farmers can also add specific supplements, such as palmitic acid, a by-product of palm-oil production, to further boost butterfat. (This practice came to widespread attention during Buttergate, in 2021, when Canadians began noticing that their butter had become firmer and less spreadable at room temperature. Palmitic acid does indeed increase the melting temperature of butter.)

You can’t actually buy this extra-rich cow’s milk at grocery stores. Despite its name, the whole milk sold in plastic jugs is not the whole milk, but a standardized fiction: For decades, the U.S. has defined whole milk to meet a minimum of 3.25 percent fat—the low end of what was once a cow’s natural range. That number has remained unchanged even as the actual average fat content of milk has risen a full percentage point above it. Any excess of fat from “whole milk” is instead transformed into high-fat dairy products: the various creams (heavy, whipping, sour, ice), butter, triple-crème Bries, ultra-lush yogurts, and so on.

Today’s 4-percent-plus milk has created problems for certain cheese makers. It is simply too rich for varieties such as cheddar, Colby, and Monterey Jack, which require a lower fat-protein ratio. Cheese makers have had to reconfigure their manufacturing lines, either to receive extra dairy protein in the form of skim milk or to install a million-dollar separator to remove excess fat. “It’s extra cost, extra steps, extra bother,” Dean Sommer, a cheese and food technologist at the Center for Dairy Research at the University of Wisconsin at Madison, told me. “They’re transitioning from the world they knew, when it comes to the fat content of milk, to the world we’re dealing with.”

The unwanted fat from cheesemaking ends up at processors such as Grassland Dairy, a large butter maker based in Wisconsin. Lately, says its president, Trevor Wuethrich, Grassland has had to keep its facility running more often to keep up with all of the leftover fat coming from cheese makers. Cheese makers that used to send a truckload of cream a week, he told me, are now sending “a load a day.” Some days, he has to turn loads away.

Where else can the extra butterfat go? A few years ago, back when butterfat prices were high, Geiger said, some ice-cream makers swapped out dairy cream for cheap gums and air, making “frozen dairy desserts” that contained too little dairy cream to be legally labeled “ice cream.” “I think there’s an opportunity to get more cream back into ice cream,” he told me. Ice-cream makers, naturally, may want to see sustained low prices before jumping back on the butterfat train.

Meanwhile, dairy farmers are already looking to hedge their bets: If not fat, then protein? (And Americans sure love their protein these days.) But breeding cows for milk protein would be more challenging, Dechow said. Milk-protein yield varies less from cow to cow, making it more difficult to make changes through genetic selection. The fat and protein levels of milk are also linked, so enhancing protein would likely enhance fat too.

The high-milk-fat dairy cow won’t be going anywhere, though. At current prices, Harvatine said, “it still makes sense for us to convert feed into butter. It’s just not nearly as profitable as it was a year ago.” If a dairy farmer is doing 10 different things to maximize butterfat, the first nine things might still make sense, he said—only “now I’m questioning the last thing that I’m doing.” And genetically, the American cow is locked in. Breeding decisions made as recently as a few months ago—when butterfat prices were at a peak—will come to fruition only over the next three or four years, as those calves are born, mature into cows, and start producing the super-rich milk of their genetic destiny. The butterfat boom is far from over.</div>

This sounds quite sinister and James Bond-ish. Is Ernst Stavro Blofeld behind the satellite interceptions?

But when we read the article we see things like this:

Now, if you&#39;re talking about pirating old content that should&#39;ve entered the public domain, had the length of copyright not been extended to the heat death of the universe, yeah, that I&#39;ll give you.

These so-called âoedodgy boxesâ let you watch content that otherwise you&#39;d have to pay for. For example, a full subscription to Sky TV including film and sports channels is close to $100 per month. Subscriptions for these boxes will run you about $100 per year.

The people running these services are essentially re-broadcasting paid-for content for a fraction of the price. The big companies are starting to notice too; I&#39;ve seen a few scaremongering &#39;news&#39; articles about them these past few months.

The people running these services are essentially re-broadcasting paid-for content for a fraction of the price.I seem to recall a story from awhile back about a guy who got busted for doing exactly that and unsuccessfully tried to argue that he was doing nothing wrong because he had legitimately paid subscriptions to the channels he was re-streaming (nobody ever reads the TOS).So, you&#39;re basically stuck running these type of pirate services from countries that really don&#39;t care to enforce copyright laws, otherwise you might as well just call prison and make reservations.

You&#39;d be surprised. A friend of mine has one and though it sometimes freezes for a few seconds the quality is just as good as what I would expect from Sky. I was tempted to get one myself but for a couple of football games it&#39;s not worth the hassle.

One other thing, the box was some sort of nvidia device (Toblerone shaped) and the UI is so much snappier than any STB or smart TV I&#39;ve ever used. As ever, the pirates&#39; user experience is better than the paying customers&#39;.

That&#39;s quite probably not all they are doing. [krebsonsecurity.com]  Remember, if it&#39;s too good/cheap to be true, then *you* are probably the product or, in this case, your bandwidth and IP address.

I don&#39;t quite understand the purpose. Most smart TVs come with a free IPTV bundle. My LG came with LG channels, that has a few hundred free streaming channels to watch. Tubi does the same thing on any smart gizmo, you can plug into a TV, the cheapest of which is around $40.
Because while those services do exist (typically using the FAST approach for older content with lower licensing costs), they do not always cover what some people want to view (I am guessing things like ESPN).

There is, and will continue to be, a disconnect between what consumers are willing to pay, and what the owners expect to receive in revenue, for the content being produced.

The Smart TV&#39;s don&#39;t come with &quot;dodgy&quot; piracy apps. The boxes are basically just preloaded with Kodi, and then a bunch of plugins for backends that are basically just abusing various system&#39;s CDN&#39;s.

Like facebook is a popular CDN to steal bandwidth from by pirates. I&#39;m sure you&#39;ve seen &quot;watch (whatever) online&quot; sites, if you go poke through their source code you can see what sites they are getting the data from.

Once outside the paywall, it no longer can generate revenue.

Content is not like shelter, healthcare, or sustenance.  people will do without if control is tightened to the point where no one can watch the content.

The fact that it is non-essential for supporting life means that there is a limit on how much revenue can be generated. At some point you reach a diminishing point of return on the curve where it is no longer profitable to go after the consumers pirating the content.

Not just cable TV is dying, but broadcast television and radio too.

Why should I put up with high ad loads while I consume linear content. It used to be that ad loads were lower decades ago, but then almost everyone has no choice but broadcast television and radio. Now, with fewer eyeballs watching radio and TV, the ad loads had to go up because broadcast ratings count eyeballs.

Broadcast radio and TV operated by corporations with deep pockets are going to wilt away. Most manufacturers of high power radio and

That&#39;s where the difference is really noticeable, because terrestrial broadcast networks have given up trying to chase eyeballs and are now going after subscribers.  So, over-the-air TV has become a dumping ground for everything nobody is willing to pay to watch.

And yet that stuff is still pretty watchable.  In my area, there are two specialty channels I like, one for sci-fi (comet) and the other for westerns (grit) and both keep showing me either stuff I&#39;ve never seen, or stuff I&#39;ve seen and don&#39;t mind running in the background as I exercise or do work of some sort.

Definitely not everyone is stealing TV. I&#39;m opposed to piracy and I&#39;m definitely not plugging one of these janky Android Trojan horses into my network.

But, the price gouging is totally out of control! Cable companies and streaming services alike. They are priced absurdly high. Even more so when one considers the low quality programming that they are pushing. Then they layer ads on top of services I&#39;m supposed to pay for? Fuck them. Piracy may well be on the table in the near future.

Not to mention going from one remote that worked properly to multiple remotes that don&#39;t work as expected and new issues with every update and every gadget.

Where is the smart in smart TVs? To me they are the Trojan horses. I had to move them off the main network.

Piracy sounds simpler and way less intrusive

We have this in South America for a looong time. I would estimate some 80% of households use these boxes.

It became so widespread that the major streaming platforms started to pressure the governments. Most of the devices were outlawed and recently there were huge cross-border crackdowns that took the pirat... ahem, alternative platforms down.

One very funny thing is that because it was a paid service, most people didn&#39;t even realized it was illegal. When the boxes started to get bricked, consumer protection organizations got flooded with millions of complaints. There are reports of people that even reported it to the police.

it suggests that the subscription costs are too high. If the pricing structure cuts out most people and they have to find another way to access the content, then lower your price.

One problem with the content market is they are hell bent on extracting the most money out of the market, they keep increasing costs and also moving content so a consumer has to access multiple subscriptions. All this puts pressure on consumers and they either have to dropout or get content another way.

Why pay for a pirate service?  It&#39;s the equivalent of &#39;script kiddie&#39; hacking.

You can find streams of pretty much anything and just download what you want to keep, and barring someone breaking into your home and taking the hardware, it can&#39;t be taken from you.

If it&#39;s on broadcast TV where you live, this is no different than grabbing it off the air with a DVR.

Convenience, reliability, the fact that you don&#39;t need to faff around trying to find a link that actually works. These things aren&#39;t aimed at hax0rs, l33t or otherwise. They&#39;re easy enough to use that your granny could do it.

Obligatory joke and not surprised nothing else has come up on today&#39;s Slashdot. Your better joke below:

(I wanted to put a down arrow here, but couldn&#39;t figure out a way to do it on ye olde Slashdot.)

The thing I find most incredible about this is that people are willing to track down and spend hundreds of dollars on a dubious piece of hardware, jump through whatever hoops they have to jump through to set it up, and maintain functionality over time - just to avoid dealing with the hassle of piecing together a decent media package/

... my rabbit ears when you pry them out of my cold, dead hands.

I hear you and like the sentiment but broadcast tv is about to be encrypted across the board.  You&#39;ll still need to pay.

I own the superbox.  I don&#39;t watch much TV, so it doesn&#39;t see much use, but yes, it has nearly everything.  More stations than I know what to do with, all the sports channels if you care about that stuff, video on demand (they&#39;re just downloaded torrents) so while most are good quality, some have the weird logos or closed caption forced in, but mostly it all just works.

I do like the live tv rewind feature too.  Show started at 5 o&#39;clock and it&#39;s 5:20?  No worries, just start from the beginning.  Not availab

If you&#39;re in it for the long term, now&#39;s the time to buy software stocks, I guess.

...as long as they aren&#39;t one of the companies that bet the farm on AI...

Those companies will never recover. On the plus side, Windows 12 can&#39;t be any worse than Windows 11 if Microsoft died before Windows 12 was released.

Yes, I meant traditional software companies that produce software and not vibe-coded vulnerability-ware.

I&#39;ve been frustrated by AI constantly making shit up and stating things as fact when it&#39;s clearly wrong.  But then I realized if you read around the internet that it&#39;s full of posts that are just factually untrue.  Like I&#39;m not talking about opinion stuff... I mean people posting absolutely untrue &quot;facts&quot; even on technical forums where a very cursory google search with turn up multiple independent sources that show they&#39;re completely wrong.

So, it turns out that if you can make a program that&#39;s only correct 90% of the time, you&#39;ve already created a program that&#39;s correct more often than the average employee, so it&#39;s probably useful.  This is completely backwards to how I think about computers, but I can&#39;t deny it.  Humans are just a lot less useful than I thought, particularly if you need them to make correct decisions.

The problem is, most people have learned to have a bit of healthy skepticism about what humans say and produce, whereas a lot more people accept anything an AI program says without any questioning.

And once AI started to get bandied about in public, the computer clergy added a new branch to their kind, the AI prophets, determined to promote the idea of computer god among the masses. And way too many people that should know better are falling for it.

If I search for what type of oil to use in my car, there will be pages and pages of forum posts of people bickering about who&#39;s wrong answer is the best.  ChatGPT gets it right the first time, and that&#39;s amazing considering it&#39;s trained on so many wrong answers.  And I&#39;d say its WAY more than 90% accurate.

Having just spent a few days butting heads with an outsourced customer service call center, I can&#39;t disagree.  These people repeatedly hallucinate facts, deny facts already in evidence, and contradict each other.  When I point this out (it&#39;s all in writing) they simply ignore what I say and repeat the behavior.

If you replaced all those people with AI, there would be problems, but maybe not worse or even fundamentally different problems.

SaaS has always been a shady business model. Now AI has experts as the only people left doing anything with building new Software, at a massively hiked productivity that still is rising almost by the week. And since AI does not care if it&#39;s working on FOSS or proprietary Software - it&#39;s actually more likely to deliver for FOSS, since FOSS documentation isn&#39;t hidden behind a paywall and can easily be processed by LLMs - experts will be using AI to work on FOSS, because they&#39;ve long since come to love the adv

On the one hand, most SaaS solutions are just webified implementations of crap that would be better suited to dBase III on DOS. On the flip side, AI as it&#39;s being sold is SaaS in all its worst forms, except now its results aren&#39;t repetable.

This index of companies is down, yes. But each company on that index  is down (or up) for different reasons.

Oracle, for example, is down in part because of the huge exposure it has to an AI bubble.Salesforce, likewise, has invested huge amounts of money and marketing on its AI gamble, which might well not play out as they hope.Fair Isaac, which doesn&#39;t have an obvious reason to be in a software index, and which isn&#39;t apparently highly exposed to risk from AI, is just down to where it was in September of las

They are a bit like fortune tellers, trying to not only predict an increasingly unpredictable future, but trying to predict what other investors will doIt&#39;s like a casino for the insane

As a society, we cannot create disruptive technologies and not expect disruption.

When I look around my industrial estate, full of fabricators, tool suppliers, hydraulics, hardware, car repair, pipe extrusion, specialist bakeries and printers,  you know, where real life happens outside the tech bubble, I can assure you AI will have zero impact for the foreseeable future. The main use I see so far, is a better search engine.

Sure, it might fuck up the biosphere and ultimately kill humanity, that&#39;s cool. But look, now we&#39;re talking real problems. It might cause a minor disruption for Wall Street! SOMETHING MUST BE DONE!

No, Nvidia will not die if OpenAI considers if there are also other graphic card companies. No, a proof of concept world model will not create games on its own. Sometimes one thinks people investing at the stock market don&#39;t have *any* idea about what the companies actually do when buying the shares.

You talk about getting laid off as though it&#39;s a bad thing. IRL it&#39;s a bit more nuanced than that.

While it&#39;s true that people who get laid off stop getting paychecks (which most of us would immediately miss!) it does come with a gigantic upside.

If you get laid off, then you don&#39;t have to go to work anymore. That results in you getting a whole third of the remaining grains in your hourglass-of-life back. Those 8 hours a day of your one-and-only limited life, no longer being wasted on misery.

Not having a choice in your employment seems like something worse to me than having a choice.

It sort of parallels silly arguments about how serfs and slaves have a good life that might be better off with, so it justifies the injustice of the relationship. Or a man that beats his wife, but his wife gets nice clothes and jewelry as an apology so she is somehow better off. Real bullshit if you ask me.

At least with most breakups there&#39;s no financial dependency for your crude logic to hinge on.

The rest of your spiel will /s pretty nicely though. &quot;This breakup is great bro!! Now you can go out with someone better!&quot;

Personally I live like a miser and would be fine for a while, but even sensible spenders/savers will be on a short clock when such an &quot;opportunity&quot; comes crashing into their budget.

I&#39;m just surprised Pinterest has so many employees remaining. What could they possibly be doing? Pinterest hasn&#39;t meaningfully changed in like 15 years now. It was always kind of worthless to begin with.

I don&#39;t even know yet what Pinterest is. At some point, I thought it was a fork of the University of Washington Pine email client.

Remember &quot;I will replace you with a very small shell script&quot;?

We&#39;re essentially replacing people with a very big script now. But they are being replaced. The inevitable has arrived.

They weren&#39;t sacked for writing a script, they were sacked for accessing private HR data. Big difference. Most companies would have sacked them.

I could do the same thing at my job (not that I need to since we&#39;re the ones deactivating accounts) and nobody would be any the wiser. It&#39;s not hard to correlate account deactivations with people being terminated. Their mistake was that they &quot;shared it more broadly&quot;. If they&#39;d just kept quiet nobody would have known, but they decided to go public with the list, and the nail that sticks up...

Not making a judgment btw, it was their choice to make, but anyone could have predicted this outcome.

It&#39;s not the same information in terms of privacy.layoffs.xls is a document that&#39;s not shared.

But if the company uses a platform like slack where people can clearly see people disappearing, then they share that data and can&#39;t possibly claim people aggregating the data they shared have done anything wrong...

&quot;The script written by the Pinterest engineers was aimed at internal tools used at the company for employees to communicate&quot;

It wasn&#39;t Slack. The summary compares the tool to Slack.

Yes, and in the EU the fired employees will probably get treated better than in the US. In the US management would try to fire them for Gross Misconduct which means that you don&#39;t get any unemployment insurance, and if they had a non-compete clause in there employment documents, it would remain in force until it  expires.

They were sacked for looking at slack statuses. Stop carrying corporate water.

We tracked that using jira tickets : IT had account deactivation tickets, tracking those gave a very precise overview of what was going on.

This is why there needs to be another channel to do account activations outside of tracking software such as Jira. The Director of HR should have gone to the Director of IT, and the director of IT should have delegated the task to someone who they trust to take care of the account deletions outside of any tracking software.

Yeah, this is very much an ESH situation. Publishing private information about (ex)coworkers is a dick move even if it&#39;s done due to a lack of communication from the business itself which is deciding to disrupt people&#39;s lives over a fucking tech fad.

A pox on all their houses. As the Pinterest product itself seems successful hopefully a business will be built to replace those jobs when someone addresses the hole in the market when Pinterest inevitably goes bust.

The IT person who didn&#39;t implement a security policy which would have prevented access to the confidential data. And if the sacked engineers who used slack deactivations, the HR person who preemptively removed the affected employees from slack before the layoffs were conducted and the people escorted out.

They weren&#39;t sacked for writing a script, they were sacked for accessing private HR data. Big difference. Most companies would have sacked them.Was it private data?  I wrote something like that at a prior company to track the changes in the list of employees returned by a corp DB query over time.  The query wasn&#39;t restricted internally.

But was it really private data, or was the company just trying to hide exactly how many they let go and whom? Even the article doesn&#39;t say what data was accessed, but if it was only employee name and city the employee worked in, I don&#39;t see that to be private at all. In fact, such a list would be really helpful.

It seems to have become the normal in the last 10 years or so to do layoffs but then not tell anyone who was let go. The problem is that when you (as the employee) need to do something special and &quot;J

It seemed like there were layoffs every Friday for a period of time. When you were getting the axe they would disable you in Active Directory by adding an underscore in front of your name. So, the internal website, &quot;Death Watch&quot;, would just look for accounts that were changed to _username and list them on the website.

A number of companies still do this where they don&#39;t broadcast that someone has left the company. Absolutely maddening when someone is just GONE and no one says anything.  They nag me about getting my expenses done but when I email the lady that was the POC for expenses and find out through the grapevine 10 days later that she&#39;s gone, then how the hell am I supposed to get my expenses done and I&#39;m having an issue submitting?

I briefly worked at one place where they tried to mandate that I add someone from ma

Yeah, none of the companies I&#39;ve worked at have notified workers.  Sometimes they notify managers.   Last time I was laid off no one told my project manager.  I had a customer deliverable due in three days and if I hadn&#39;t sent him a goodbye email on my way out (they can&#39;t instantly deactivate your account when you&#39;re working from home and you&#39;re let go over Zoom) he wouldn&#39;t have known I was gone until after the deliverable was missed.  It would have been a major issue.  No clue what happened after I left.

&quot;The new OS won&#39;t be compatible with all existing Chromebook hardware&quot;

Like, too big to fit on the drive incompatible?  Or like, we checked a version number and we and our partners have decided that you&#39;re too cheap to use our new OS?

There are two things here.  One is getting an OS that can be installed on most computers out there, unlike ChromeOS, which is limited in that area.  The other is having either an upgrade path for Chrome OS, or a merge path for ChromeOS into this Android.  Ideally, if it can take both, that would be great

One option could be to have different configurations of the OS depending on the resources available.  If one is doing it on a barebones Chromebook w/ say, 2GB of RAM and 16GB of storage, then just install

> There are two things here. One is getting an OS that can be installed on most computers out there, unlike ChromeOS, which is limited in that area

ChromeOS is pretty portable. There have been multiple, successful, projects to create generic installers for it and Google even decided to bless one. ChromeOS is basically a Gentoo fork that&#39;s been heavily locked down. The only proprietary part that talks to hardware in the entire system is their display system, which is true of Android too. Google&#39;s blessed version is ChromeOS Flex, based upon CloudReady, as a generic installer for PCs.

The issue is very much the opposite: Android is not a very generic operating system at all, built from the ground up and using a patched Linux kernel, so that is going to be hard to port to hardware it wasn&#39;t designed for. I&#39;ve actually been wondering if that&#39;s 99% of the motivation for Android for PC: it&#39;s not that there&#39;s anything wrong with ChromeOS, it does exactly what it&#39;s supposed to do, it&#39;s that it was too open and open source for an increasingly anti-openness Google.

The problem with ChromeOS is Google having to maintain two Linux distributions. The only reason it even exists at all is that Chrome for Android was shit at the time at which ChromeOS was released. Its entire purpose for existing is running desktop Chrome on cheap laptops. Now that Chrome for Android is basically OK, it has no reason to exist. Unfortunately for Google they are going to have to support it for another decade, but that support could be pretty bad and probably still meet any notional promises t

Now that Chrome for Android is basically OK, it has no reason to exist. Unfortunately for Google they are going to have to support it for another decade, but that support could be pretty bad and probably still meet any notional promises they&#39;ve made.I kinda wonder if they might offer cheap and/or subsidized hardware upgrades in order to whittle that decade of support down to two or three years. In the end that might cost them less than even shitty support for an obsoleted OS would cost over the next ten years.

Talking about from a platform standpoint, there are currently only two, potentially three platforms that Android would have to support: Arm, x86 and maybe RISC-V.  I understand that Arm has many variants, but they just have to focus on Arm8, and maybe Arm7, depending on how far back they want to support.  That would limit the number of vendors to about 3-4 - Qualcomm, AMD, Nvidia, MediaTek, unless other CPU vendors wanted to make their own hardware port of the lower levels of Linux that need to understand e

ChromeOS and Android are both based on Linux, so run on most stuff with a bit of effort. ChromeOS Flex is the version for general computers and is decently compatible.

This seems like a storm in a teacup. They are talking about 5-6 years of overlap, which isn&#39;t untypical for this kind of big OS shift. 10 years of support isn&#39;t massive either, it&#39;s what Microsoft offers for Windows. Support only means fixing security issues and existing bugs.

10 years of support is good, but if I can switch my 2 Chromebooks to Android versions, I&#39;d much prefer that, so that I can continue to update them until I get to a version that fills up their entire storage.  Or unless they croak

Itâ(TM)s finally the year of Linux on the desktop. And it will be locked down so tight that it can only install software that someone else thinks users should be allowed to. At least Microsoft allows users to make choices about what software they run. Maybe this will at least convince more people to try Ubuntu.

Well, the general public i.e. those not addicted to Apple toys, are at least pretty familiar w/ the Android interface, be it on phones or tablets.  It won&#39;t be a major leap to have that working for laptops.  In fact, an added benefit of that to computer makers: they can now make Arm laptops from various vendors - Qualcomm, Nvidia, AMD (whenever their Arm offering is out) for starters, and any of the other myriad Arm CPU vendors out there.  Instead of the x86 duopoly of AMD and Intel

One thing I&#39;d like Android, or any other Android-based OS to do is give people the option of saving their application data just on local storage or removeable storage, like USB thumb drives or external SSDs, w/o requiring people to upload it to Google Drive or any other. Or alternately, in settings, give people the option of storing it on either a variety of Cloud storage services, or even enter a custom URL of their own cloud storage (if someone has a NAS in one&#39;s home network)As great as that would be, I expect Google to follow Microsoft&#39;s lead and increasingly wrest control of all data from users&#39; hands. Tech giants do not want people having control over their own data - they want ALL of it to feed to LLMs and to sell to brokers.Personal data is to these companies as air is to us. They can&#39;t live and thrive without it, because it&#39;s what fuels the whole sick ecosystem they&#39;ve set up.

Columbia computer science professor Jason Nieh, who interviewed Google engineers as a witness in the case, testified that Aluminium requires a heavier software stack and more powerful hardware to run.This just doesn&#39;t make sense. We&#39;re supposed to believe that the software now running on phones requires more hardware than the software now running on laptops?

There are millions upon millions of perfectly good computers that are now going to landfills because of that, and they could all have Flex running on them if it wasn&#39;t for Google&#39;s short-sighted strategy. You can&#39;t even watch a DVD on Flex after Google shitcanned VideoLan from their approved apps list. They insist you use only Google stuff via the cloud. Such a damn wasted opportunity since Flex is easy to install and use otherwise, and a fairly pleasant user experience.

I&#39;m convinced Google is run by idiots. Yes, very likely. They were somewhat innovative for a while and they got really lucky with the timing when they launched search. But that is essentially the amount of their contribution. These days, they are a cult and cults are 100% idiots. Google is no exception.As a side note, I had a look at some research papers by Google. These people did supposedly hire the best and the brightest? No way. That trash would have been soundly rejected by the reviewers if it did not have the name Google on it. No bling re

NOTHING makes sense! If they want to merge them both why call one Android and one Aluminium? Now they&#39;re having &quot;desktop mode&quot; in Android that supports keyboard and mouse, and is intended for really all display sizes, from small portable monitors to large TVs and anything in between. Just say &quot;Android&quot; and call it a day, it&#39;s probably the most popular OS out there anyway, take advantage of the network effect.

Microsoft tried to call their thing Windows Mobile _number_, Windows _number_ Mobile, and Windows Ph

Will it be anything worthwhile? Or will it be another tiny niche Google walled garden, eclipsed by Windows, MacOS, Linux...

Given that the project will likely be dead within 3 years of launch, I do not think we should care.

The controversy will arise from the spelling of AluminumWho cares. The only people who spell it that way are still using Imperial measurements.  We&#39;ve moved on to arguing over how to pronounce GIF.     (It&#39;s &#39;jiff&#39; BTW)

Yep.  Just like its original creator claimed.  It&#39;s his creation.  He named it and told people how to pronounce it.  I respect him and his work.

Is it called Aluminium or Aluminum? It&#39;s already controversial.

I thought it was called Fuchsia, but I guess that was too effeminate for today&#39;s culture...

They shoulld have asked me; I&#39;d call it Tritium, because it is lightweight, and has halflife of 12 years.

Well, in this case, there is already a Microsoft and Apple duopoly.  Google is the third player

Right now, nobody can really play in Apple&#39;s space, w/o installing Linux and probably voiding the warranty.  On PCs, Microsoft currently has the monopoly - again aside from Linux and the BSDs, and fringe OSs like KolibriOS, Haiku,....  So if Google adds this - be it Android or ChromeOS Flex, they&#39;ll just be the third player

This should be completely legal, given who else is playing.  Also, if Google wants to ma

Well, it is Google, so not much of a surprise. They are more and more going the way of Microsoft.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">David Enrich’s whole life right now is the Epstein files. As an investigations editor at the New York Times, his phone and computer basically explode whenever new files are released.Last Friday, his phone exploded again when the Department of Justice dropped about 3 million pages of documents into the cloud.

Back in November, Democrats and Republicans worked together to force the DOJ to release all they’d discovered about Jeffrey Epstein—the country’s most notorious sex criminal and probably one of the richest, too. With this latest release, the DOJ says it has satisfied that demand. But it’s not even all they’ve got.

The Times built its own internal search engine to sort through the sludge. It doesn’t just search for specific words; you can ask it to search for concepts like bribery. And these documents aren’t just emails about President Donald Trump, or giddy vacation planning for rich folks hoping to hop a ride to Epstein’s infamous island. There are photos and videos, even bank records.

On a recent episode of What Next, host Mary Harris spoke to Enrich about the latest Epstein file drop and what it says about Bill Gates, Elon Musk, and Donald Trump. This transcript has been edited and condensed for clarity.

Mary Harris: Before we dig into exactly what’s in the file and what it says, what does the sheer volume of what’s been released tell you?

David Enrich: I don’t have much confidence in the government. I don’t have much sense that the majority of this stuff has been read thoroughly.

When these files were released, a number of things seemed to have been released by mistake. The implication of that is that they didn’t know exactly what they were releasing. But it’s also really awful stuff. Pictures of women and young girls without any kind of redaction. They’re identifiable, nude. Very upsetting, essentially. And your team was part of the team that found that, right?

This has been a real mess by the government. The argument they make is that they only had two months to pull this stuff together because the Epstein Files Transparency Act was passed and signed into law in November, with a December deadline. But the truth is that Trump came into office saying he was going to be transparent about this and release the files, and they made a series of choices and decisions not to do that, which I think were based in part on their gradual understanding of the fact that what was in these may be damaging to Trump or his allies.

So they then entered this frenzied period, starting in November, and did not do a good job. There are a huge number of things in there that are identifying victims, a number of files that have a high likelihood of being child sexual abuse material, and all sorts of other damaging stuff that serves no public interest and was not, in fact, required by law to be disclosed. What they’ve done is all these haphazard redactions, redacting a bunch of things they’re not supposed to redact. We found that Steve Bannon had texted Epstein, and Epstein’s name was redacted, and Trump’s face was redacted. And it’s like, why on earth would that stuff be redacted? At the same time, we’re seeing victims’ names identified.

The government is being somewhat responsive now when things are being brought to their attention. They’re taking them down and are re-redacting them. But at the same time, they appear to have overredacted quite a bit of stuff.

What stands out to me in this possible final release of files is the way that neither Donald Trump nor Jeffrey Epstein seem to be able to escape each other. These are two people who were friends in the 1990s and early 2000s. There are reports that there was a falling-out between them. Epstein gets arrested for sex acts with a minor. Donald Trump decides to run for president. But these guys can’t stop talking about each other.

Yeah, they were very close for a while, but Epstein’s defining human trait was an ability to seize on his connections and leverage them for as much currency as he could. And that came in many forms, right? That’s why he had all these pictures of himself with famous people in his houses, because he liked to be able to show those off to other famous people, or to use these as a threat hanging over the heads of his victims.

With Trump, it’s playing out in some different ways. Part of it is that with Trump’s rise to power back in 2016, Epstein realized that here was someone who had great power to either make Epstein’s life better or worse. And so I think he was really trying to suss out, initially, how he could pull those different levers. It obviously didn’t work very well, since during Trump’s first term, Epstein ended up in prison and then died.

And the files were kind of a useful tool for Trump and Trump’s allies, in particular, to beat Democrats and fan the flames of conspiracy theories on the far right. There’s no doubt that one of the things that got Trump elected in 2024 was this band of far-right MAGA people who were convinced that Trump was going to expose this global ring of pedophiles on the left and through the Epstein files.

The big allegation about Trump in these latest files involves calls to the FBI’s tip line. And these are a little dicey to talk about, because these are unverified tips. The FBI gets all kinds of unverified tips all the time. But could you just lay out what’s in there?

I’m going to be like a really anal New York Times reporter. We’ve made a decision institutionally that we’re not going to give airtime to things that we really just have no idea if they are true or not, especially when they’re of this lurid nature. But I mean, in general, it’s just very lurid sexual allegations involving Trump in the context of his relationship with Epstein. And they’re very bad allegations.

Let’s talk about some of the other big names that have been in the spotlight since the latest release. My understanding is that in these files, you see Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick trying to make plans to go to Epstein’s island. He was in friendly contact with Jeffrey Epstein long after he said he’d shut the relationship down.

Yeah, and the crazy thing here is that Lutnik just last year had said not only that he had shut the relationship down, but he had given this whole explanation for why he’d shut it down, which was that he’d visited Epstein’s mansion and he’d seen stuff in there that made him and his wife really uncomfortable. And they had vowed then and there to never associate with this terrible man again. But what we see in these files shows that’s just not true at all. They by all accounts had a pretty chummy relationship. They visited Epstein on his island long after this alleged encounter in the townhouse that left them so unsettled.

There’s also Bill Gates, founder of Microsoft. There have been allegations for years that Gates and Jeffrey Epstein were close. But in this latest release of documents, there are these implications that Epstein was helping procure women for Bill Gates and that Gates got a sexually transmitted infection, and was trying to get drugs to treat himself and secretly treat his own wife. She’s been asked about this, and she’s given an answer basically saying, This takes me back to the worst times of my marriage, which isn’t a, like, Hell no, this didn’t happen. It’s something quite different.

We’ve known for years, since Epstein’s death, about the long-running relationship between Gates and Epstein that involved everything, apparently, from science to money to women, or girls perhaps. I can’t say I’m shocked to see Gates’ reentry into this. The thing I’ll caution about here is—and I’m not at all defending Gates or his apparent conduct, and it is entirely possible that those emails were true and accurately reflected what Epstein and people like Gates did—but it is possible that Epstein is a liar and an embellisher and an expert in using threats and leverage to get what he wants with powerful people. And so it is not outside the realm of possibility that Epstein was exaggerating or twisting the truth. That being said, we know, and this has been out there in public for a while, that part of the reason that Bill and Melinda Gates got divorced was her discomfort with her husband’s relationship with Epstein. And while we’ve never really had the full gory details and what that’s entailed, it’s obviously been a subject of informed speculation.

Elon Musk is in here. He’s writing to Jeffrey Epstein asking, When is the wildest party on your island, because I want to make sure that I come. What do you make of this?

Once again, we are seeing people who had previously denied or downplayed their relationships with Epstein, and in fact had pointed at other people for being more connected to Epstein, we are now seeing that they, long after Epstein was known as a sexual criminal and had registered as a Level 3 sex offender, were continuing to associate with him.

You’ve talked about transparency being important here. Can we talk about what we’re not seeing in this release of documents? We were promised 6 million documents. I thought they were legally required to release all the files, so what is happening there?

That is a good question, and I don’t have a good answer. What the Justice Department has said is that they withheld a large quantity of documents to protect victims’ identities.Two things can be true: They can be protecting victims’ identities by not releasing 3 million documents and they can also be doing a bad job of protecting victims’ identities in the 3 million pages of documents that they did release. That being said, this administration’s handling of the Epstein files doesn’t have a whole lot of credibility.

A year ago, Attorney General Pam Bondi and FBI Director Kash Patel said they released the Epstein files by handing binders full of public court documents to a group of MAGA influencers. That was the whole start of this. And it’s gone along on the same trajectory with deceitful disclosures. In that context, I think it is normal and reasonable for open-minded people to be skeptical and curious about what’s actually in these other 3 million pages of documents.

To get to this point, Congress had to act of its own accord, essentially, and force the release. Are there other avenues available to lawmakers who want to see more here?

The Justice Department has said it is going to meet with lawmakers to explain its thinking. The other options are not necessarily in terms of getting these files, but there are other ways to get some more transparency. And one of the things we’ve seen is that the House Oversight Committee has issued a bunch of subpoenas to a wide variety of people demanding that they sit for depositions under oath, the transcripts of which will presumably be released in short order. And that ranges from people like the Clintons to people like former Victoria Secret CEO Les Wexner, who was one of Epstein’s biggest financial benefactors over the years. We’ll see what happens.

There are a huge number of wealthy, powerful individuals all over the world who continued to associate with Epstein and provide him with various kinds of support long after he went to jail.To me, what has made the Epstein story so riveting and so important for so many years is that yes, this is a story about a guy who is a pedophile and was doing terrible things to women and girls. But much more than that, it is a story about how one individual, when he accrues enough wealth and influence and connections, can work the entire global system to his benefit for very nefarious purposes. And he does it in conjunction and in some cases partnership with some of the richest, most powerful people on Earth. And that is a story that has not yet fully been told.

Just when it seemed that things couldn’t get any stranger, the Trump administration has injected abortion law into its efforts to stamp out anti-ICE protests. Last week, Don Lemon, an independent reporter, and two protesters were arrested on federal charges arising out of an anti–Immigration and Customs Enforcement protest at a Minnesota church. One of the key charges involves the Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances Act, legislation passed in 1993 to protect access to reproductive health facilities and places of worship. Understanding the law’s past and present reveals how the Department of Justice has repurposed it to crack down on protest that the president opposes.

The FACE Act passed at a time of escalating anti-abortion protest. Abortion opponents had watched as Republican presidents reshaped the U.S. Supreme Court, but abortion remained legal. Frustrations spilled over, and a growing number of Americans joined clinic blockades led by Operation Rescue, a group that sought to shut down abortion clinics. As Time magazine reported, the primary tactic Operation Rescue used was “to jam all entrances to an abortion clinic before the police can muster sufficient officers to begin arrests.”

Operation Rescue members did get arrested but often faced minor charges, like trespassing, before quickly returning to the protest front lines. Most of those who attended these protests were peaceful—Operation Rescue instructed recruits on what it called nonviolent civil disobedience. But the group’s message was that lawbreaking was justified in the name of saving the lives of the unborn.

That message was hard to contain, and by 1993, anti-abortion extremists were arguing that it was legitimate to use violence against providers. That year saw the first of a series of murders of abortion doctors. Congress responded with the FACE Act, which sought to distinguish peaceful protest and speech (much of which is protected under the First Amendment) from violence, threats of force, and efforts to obstruct access to clinics. Sponsored by Democrat Ted Kennedy and Republican Constance Morella, the law drew inspiration partly from a federal law already protecting “interference with rights,” including religious exercise.

The addition of places of worship was meant to doom passage of the act at a time when Democrats controlled both houses of Congress; a staffer for Utah Sen. Orrin Hatch (the now-prominent conservative Ed Whelan) added the language as a poison pill. There was also a plan to mock the bill if it passed: Whelan hoped that the addition would change the acronym for the law to the FARCE Act.

But Kennedy was in favor of the addition in no small part because of the historic victimization of Black churches, synagogues, and other places of worship—a trend that was all too evident in several mass shootings last year. If anything, the tactic cemented the bill’s bipartisan appeal: Seventeen Republican senators and three members of the House ultimately supported it.

Abortion opponents immediately challenged the law’s constitutionality under the First Amendment, arguing that the statute censored speech and singled out abortion foes for prosecution. The courts rejected that argument by stressing that the FACE Act was narrow: It applied only to conduct and was enforced regardless of what message protesters intended to convey. Constitutional arguments against the act have reemerged since the demise of Roe v. Wade, with the CATO Institute arguing that there may no longer be any congressional authority for the law and that it may thus be unconstitutional.

The FACE Act had a major impact on the clinic blockade movement, which relied on a large number of recruits to stop patients from entering abortion clinics. Rather than minor trespassing charges, protesters now weighed the prospect of serious fines and prison time, with penalties escalating for repeat offenders.

But the line between speech and obstruction, threats, or violence can sometimes be messy to draw in context. That meant that federal prosecutors were often reluctant to bring FACE Act charges, even when Democrats were in office. With Joe Biden in the White House, federal prosecutors did file charges against not only anti-abortion groups like Red Rose Rescue (a next-generation clinic blockade group) but also Jane’s Revenge, a militant abortion-rights group that carried out a campaign of vandalism, arson, and bombing.

Fast-forward to 2026, when the FACE Act is enjoying a bizarre renaissance. Over the years, bipartisan consensus about the legislation collapsed, and conservative Republicans began calling for its repeal. Then, in January 2025, a spokesperson for the Trump administration announced that the White House would no longer enforce the FACE Act absent “extraordinary circumstances” or “significant aggravating factors.” Abortion opponents clearly see this announcement as an opportunity. Randall Terry, the 77-year-old founder of Operation Rescue, is working with his girlfriend, Terrisa Bukovinac, the 44-year-old leader of a group called Progressive Anti-Abortion Uprising, to launch a new wave of protests and reach a younger generation of potential recruits.

But “extraordinary circumstances” might not be as hard for the administration to find when the president doesn’t like what protesters are saying. The White House has turned its FACE Act focus toward language protecting places of worship from those who interfere with religious exercise “by force or threat of force or physical obstruction” to target messages that the administration opposes.

First came an indictment against a group of pro-Palestinian protesters and organizations arising from a November 2024 demonstration outside a New Jersey synagogue. Organized by the Party for Socialism and Liberation in New Jersey and American Muslims for Palestine New Jersey, the protest targeted an event promoting the sale of property in Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank. What happened next is unclear, but violence broke out between the protesters and pro-Israel counterprotesters. New Jersey prosecutors concluded that pro-Israel demonstrators were the first to cross the line into violence, and the Department of Justice disagreed. Either way, it seemed to be a strange choice for an administration that had announced a lack of interest in enforcing the FACE Act to prioritize a case in which local law enforcement saw the facts so differently.

Now the administration is pursuing similar charges against Don Lemon. The former CNN anchor and his co-defendants faced charges based on an anti-ICE protest at Cities Church, a site that was chosen because protesters believed its pastor to be the acting director of a local ICE field office. At the time, 3,000 ICE agents had flooded the Twin Cities, and Renee Good had recently been shot and killed by federal immigration officials. Alex Pretti would be killed later in the ICE surge.

Prosecutors claim that Lemon, a noted critic of the president, helped organize the Cities Church protest, which they frame as an attack. The indictment charges that Lemon then obstructed church members from leaving by posting himself at the door and asking them questions.

Based on the available evidence, it’s hard to see these charges as anything but disturbing and wrong. Video of the incident shows heated exchanges between Lemon and his interview subjects, who clearly disagree with him about immigration policy and the conduct of ICE in the Twin Cities. There are moments when the journalist is asked to leave, or when the people to whom he’s speaking clearly want to move on. And people do leave, including the ones Lemon seems to aggravate the most. The video doesn’t show much more physical contact than Lemon pushing his microphone into the subjects’ faces. If that act qualifies as physical obstruction, it’s hard to see what kind of press scrum would not.

Drawing the line between protected speech and obstruction or threats isn’t always straightforward. And even when the line is clear, protests about everything from ICE to abortion often involve civil disobedience like trespassing. Those protests can involve speech that is rude, unconvincing, or even hateful. But the line between protected speech and wrongful conduct can’t depend on the reasons people are protesting. With this latest prosecution, that’s just the danger we face.

From Los Angeles to Chicago to Minneapolis to Maine, ICE agents are leaving a trail of destruction and fear. The most important harms they leave behind are broken lives, injuries, and deaths. There are already important efforts in the works to hold them to account via criminal investigations and civil actions. Yet these actions will be hard to win. Meanwhile, Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents are wreaking another, second-string harm, this one involving the destruction of personal property. This damage flagrantly violates another constitutional provision—and there is a clear and uncluttered legal pathway to address those harms that so far has not been invoked. It’s past time it was used.

ICE’s violent enforcement actions often involve the needless destruction of people’s personal property. The Fifth Amendment’s takings clause makes such property destruction unconstitutional. Demanding damages for these harms may seem to miss the mark, in the sense that they do not address the features that make ICE’s strategies so horrifying, specifically the physical violence against human beings. This is quite fair. But often there will simply be no other practical way for ICE’s victims to obtain redress, such that an action for property harms may well be the best, even the only, route available.

Take the case of Minneapolis resident ChongLy “Scott” Thao. In January, ICE agents battered down Thao’s door, dragged him out in his underwear, and handled him in a degrading, contemptuous, and very likely racist manner—before confirming that he was, as he said, a U.S. citizen. Thao surely ought to be able to seek damages for the grave harms to his person and dignity. The conservative Roberts court, however, has made such damages actions—called Bivens suits—extremely hard to win thanks to doctrines such as “qualified immunity.” The latter is a misleading name, as it is practically insurmountable in many cases. Some federal courts of appeals have even ruled that ICE agents are categorically immune from constitutional damages actions under all circumstances.

But the facts of Thao’s case are unlikely to prove outliers in coming weeks. ICE has developed an internal policy memo telling its officers that they can forcibly enter people’s homes without a judicial warrant. This policy, which perversely echoes the British colonial abuses that precipitated the American Revolution, invites the repetition of Thao’s ordeal around the nation. A key way to fight back would be lawsuits under the takings clause.

This is not the only kind of serious property damage ICE habitually engages in, though. From Arizona to Maine to Colorado, immigration agents have stopped people’s cars, smashed in windows, dragged out drivers, and left cars running on the street—in effect inviting their theft. In other cases, ICE agents have rammed private vehicles, using a tactic most police departments have banned as too dangerous, to make an arrest.

But there is an explicit constitutional prohibition against the federal government destroying property without “just compensation.” Again, it’s the takings clause. While it’s usually applied when the federal government exercises eminent domain and takes title to land, the takings clause also covers the government’s outright destruction of personal property. What’s more, there are no barriers to recovery akin to qualified immunity.

Applying the takings clause to the destruction of personal property by lawless federal agents makes a certain historical sense. At least one influential legal treatise–writer of the founding period, St. George Tucker, opined that the takings clause had been threaded into the Bill of Rights as a response to the military destruction of personal property during the Colonial-era wars. If Thao or other victims of ICE brought suit, that is, they’d arguably be walking in hallowed footprints.

Would courts be willing to entertain these claims today? Some courts of appeals have dismissed takings claims against state and local police on the theory that the takings clause only applies when government takes title to land. This is flat wrong. For example, the Supreme Court has held that a federal regulation requiring a raisin farmer to destroy a portion of his crop is a per se taking. The government destruction of things, that is, counts as a taking.

Other courts, more plausibly, have held that a takings claim can be brought only when a police officer is acting unreasonably in destroying property. In Thao’s case, and many others, agents’ claim that they are acting “reasonably” would be thwarted by body-cam footage, or the fact that their tactics violate well-established policing practices, such as don’t ram a suspect’s car to get it off the road. Indeed, there are now a trail of court victories on behalf of people whose houses have been damaged by SWAT raids.

If there was any doubt about such claims, it should be extinguished by the fact that Congress has identified precisely how such cases can be brought. It has designated the U.S. Court of Federal Claims as the right tribunal for takings claims over $10,000. Smaller claims are brought in the relevant district court. In both kinds of cases, federal law establishes a fee-shifting mechanism: A win for a plaintiff means that the government has to pay attorney’s fees. This fee-structure means that takings claims should be available even when litigants lack upfront fees for a lawyer, but have an otherwise strong case.

Property damage is, no doubt, a decidedly venal sin in comparison to the grave violations of civil and human rights for which ICE is responsible. But it is a sad fact that Congress and the courts have made it well-nigh impossible to sue if you are brutalized or injured by ICE—and straightforward to prevail if your personal property is busted up. In a moment of less acute emergency, there are good reasons to fix that topsy-turvy situation. In the bleak midst of ICE’s violent blizzard, we must use every lawful tool at our disposal to hit the brakes on its lawless destruction and desecration of Americans’ homes and lives.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Last month, I traveled to Minneapolis to report on Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s presence. While there, I documented intense struggles between local residents and federal agents—an important story with deadly consequences. But I also heard constantly about another, equally important story: that of the thousands of immigrants who’ve made Minnesota their home and are trying to survive the federal occupation. Reaching people living in those conditions is difficult, precisely because their well-being depends on them staying out of sight. But after multiple attempts, I was connected with a man who has been hiding in his home for fear of being detained. To protect his identity, privacy, and safety, identifying details have been omitted. What follows is his account, originally told in Spanish, of his time in hiding—and the federal abduction of his son.

The most difficult day of my life was the day they grabbed my son.

I am from Guatemala. I left because economically, there is very little opportunity. Delinquency is high. You work, you get paid very little, and there are people waiting to rob you. I left my wife and my children and came here with my son so I could earn a little more and take care of my family back home.

We’ve lived in Minneapolis for seven years. Before the ICE raids intensified, my life was relaxing but full of work. I worked hard, and left my house knowing I would come back. I could walk outside during the day and at night. I slept for a few hours, made my breakfast, made my lunch to take to work the next day; that’s the life of an immigrant. Sundays were my only day of rest, but even then I worked doing laundry, grocery shopping, going to Walmart, talking to people, getting to know the community.

When I arrived in Minneapolis, it felt like my country. I saw people who looked like me. I got used to the snow, the cold, working in all conditions. We worked hard for a few good months to save, then kept working through the winter anyway.

I used to watch Americans buy a few things—soap, bread, eggs, milk. But Hispanic families? We filled two full carts. We move the economy. We move money here, and we send money back to our families. That’s why it hurts so much to be seen like this now. We are not delinquents. We are hard workers. We work from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. Sometimes we work with lamps on our foreheads. All to help the families we left behind.

On Jan. 6, we woke up early. I didn’t want to leave the house and go to work that day. I told my son that, but he said he wanted to go. He left around 8:45 in the morning. At 10 a.m., his boss called me and asked, “Where is your son? Have you heard from him?” That’s when my heart dropped.

As a father, I wanted to go out and look for him. I wanted to do everything possible. But seeing how things are, I had to avoid going outside. Later, I was watching the news. I saw a video from detention. I saw my son there, chained by his feet. That’s when I knew. That’s when I realized they had him. That image stays with you.

My son is 36 years old. He is a special-needs person. He doesn’t talk. After suffering a stroke, his tongue is stuck. One of his eyes is dead. He works because he needs to work. Here in Minneapolis, he was in medical therapy, learning how to use his jaw again. He was being treated by a doctor here. This is where we were helping him. This is where he was receiving care.

And suddenly, we knew nothing. They told me he was going to be put on a plane to Guatemala on Jan. 19. Then they said he would be released the next day. Then the day passed, and nothing happened. I called the Guatemalan Consulate. They told me they had sent a lawyer to see him. That was a lie. I called another consulate. They told me he was in Louisiana. Then they said no, now he is in El Paso, Texas.

I haven’t received one call from him. Not one.

Not knowing where your family is, that is the hardest thing. Especially now, with the way they are treating us. They are not treating us like people. They are treating us worse than how people in Guatemala treat animals when they go hunting. They grab you by the throat. They throw you to the ground. They put their knees on your neck. That’s how they are treating us. Like animals.

I see on the news that people have died in detention centers in El Paso. I ask myself, as a father: What is happening to him? Where is my son really? If I have to show his photo on television, in the news, in other countries, I will do it. I will not be quiet.

I have cried bitterly. I have cried in solitude. I have gotten to my knees and prayed to God. Only God can do justice. God is big. God is good. God will help. But my body is not the same body as before. My mind is not the same anymore.

For almost two months now, I have been closed inside my home. I don’t go to work. I don’t go to the store. Every time someone knocks on the door, I ask myself, who is it? There is a lot of tension. There is a lot of fear. We need psychologists to help us with everything that is happening. This isn’t easy. And on top of that, we have to use our little resources for this.

I am an older person. I have cholesterol. I have high blood pressure. I recently suffered from pneumonia. I need medication. I always liked having extra medicine in case of emergencies, so at night I wouldn’t worry. Food is a basic necessity. Thank God, He put angels in my path. People with papers get groceries for me. My church and my pastor help me. People in the community help us get what we can’t go out to get. When you know God, God doesn’t stop providing.

I don’t have a bank account. I save my money in cash for emergencies, because you never know. Every week, you work, you get a check, and you have to decide between food, bills, and sending money to your family. You always put something away, because you never know. God told me to save for difficult times. Difficult times are here.

We got used to the freedoms here. Now there is no liberty. We are isolated. Minneapolis feels like a war zone. People tell you, if you don’t have to go out, don’t go out. What ICE is doing is terrorism. This was a beautiful country. Where did that country go? It hurts to be seen like this now.

If they detain me, I won’t fight. These people have no compassion. They see us as criminals. The president says we are criminals. But we haven’t killed anyone. We came here to work. If the day comes, I will go back to my country. But not this way. Not as a delinquent. One day we may return. But this isn’t the way.

If I could say something to ICE or to President Donald Trump, I would say this: God is the owner of all of this. Not you. God Almighty is the only owner. One day He will come. And I hope they regret everything they are doing right now. Only God is responsible for justice.

As I prepared this story on Tuesday, a local contact texted me with news: “FYI his son arrived in Guatemala today, finally after 20 days of waiting.”

            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2026/02/04/aws_cloud_breakin_ai_assist/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">A digital intruder broke into an AWS cloud environment and in just under 10 minutes went from initial access to administrative privileges, thanks to an AI speed assist.

The Sysdig Threat Research Team said they observed the break-in on November 28, and noted it stood out not only for its speed, but also for the &quot;multiple indicators&quot; suggesting the criminals used large language models to automate most phases of the attack, from reconnaissance and privilege escalation to lateral movement, malicious code writing, and LLMjacking - using a compromised cloud account to access cloud-hosted LLMs.

&quot;The threat actor achieved administrative privileges in under 10 minutes, compromised 19 distinct AWS principals, and abused both Bedrock models and GPU compute resources,&quot; Sysdig&#39;s threat research director Michael Clark and researcher Alessandro Brucato said in a blog post about the cloud intrusion. &quot;The LLM-generated code with Serbian comments, hallucinated AWS account IDs, and non-existent GitHub repository references all point to AI-assisted offensive operations.&quot;

The attackers initially gained access by stealing valid test credentials from public Amazon S3 buckets. The credentials belonged to an identity and access management (IAM) user with multiple read and write permissions on AWS Lambda and restricted permissions on AWS Bedrock. Plus, the S3 bucket also contained Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) data for AI models, which would come in handy later during the attack.

To prevent this type of credential theft, don&#39;t leave access keys in public buckets. Sysdig recommends using temporary credentials for IAM roles, and for organizations that insist on granting long-term credentials to IAM users, make sure you rotate them periodically.

After unsuccessfully trying usernames such as &quot;sysadmin&quot; and &quot;netadmin&quot; typically associated with admin-level privileges, the attacker ultimately achieved privilege escalation through Lambda function code injection, abusing the compromised user&#39;s UpdateFunctionCode and UpdateFunctionConfiguration permissions:

They replaced the code of an existing Lambda function named EC2-init three times, iterating on their target user. The first attempt targeted adminGH, which, despite its name, lacked admin privileges. Subsequent attempts eventually succeeded in compromising the admin user frick.

The security sleuths note that the comments in the code are written in Serbian - likely indicating the intruder&#39;s origin - the code itself listed all IAM users and their access keys, created access keys for frick, and listed S3 buckets along with their content.

Plus, the attacker&#39;s code contained &quot;comprehensive&quot; exception handling, according to the security sleuths, including logic to limit S3 bucket listings and an increase to the Lambda execution timeout from three seconds to 30 seconds.

These factors, combined with the short time from credential theft to Lambda execution, &quot;strongly suggest&quot; the code was written by an LLM, according to the threat hunters.

Next, the miscreant set about collecting account IDs and attempting to assume OrganizationAccountAccessRole in all AWS environments. Interestingly, they included account IDs that did not belong to the victim organization: two with ascending and descending digits (123456789012 and 210987654321), and one ID that appeared to belong to a legitimate external account.

&quot;This behavior is consistent with patterns often attributed to AI hallucinations, providing further potential evidence of LLM-assisted activity,&quot; Clark and Brucato wrote.

In total, the attacker gained access to 19 AWS identities, including six different IAM roles across 14 sessions, plus five other IAM users. And then, with the new admin user account they had created, the crims snarfed up a ton of sensitive data: secrets from Secrets Manager, SSM parameters from EC2 Systems Manager, CloudWatch logs, Lambda function source code, internal data from S3 buckets, and CloudTrail events.

They then turned to the LLMjacking part of the attack to gain access to the victim&#39;s cloud-hosted LLMs. For this, they abused the user&#39;s Amazon Bedrock access to invoke multiple models including Claude, DeepSeek, Llama, Amazon Nova Premier, Amazon Titan Image Generator, and Cohere Embed.

Sysdig notes that &quot;invoking Bedrock models that no one in the account uses is a red flag,&quot; and enterprises can create Service Control Policies (SCPs) to allow only certain models to be invoked.

After Bedrock, the intruder focused on EC2, querying machine images suitable for deep learning applications. They also began using the victim&#39;s S3 bucket for storage, and one of the scripts stored therein looks like it was designed for ML training - but it uses a GitHub repository that doesn&#39;t exist, suggesting an LLM hallucinated the repo in generating the code.

While the researchers say they can&#39;t determine the attacker&#39;s goal - possibly model training or reselling compute access - they note that the script launches a publicly accessible JupyterLab server on port 8888, providing a backdoor to the instance that doesn&#39;t require AWS credentials.

However, they terminated the instance after five minutes for unknown reasons.

This is the latest in examples of attackers increasingly relying on AI to help them at almost every stage in the attack chain, and some security chiefs have warned that it&#39;s just a matter of time before criminals can fully automate attacks at scale.

There are things organizations can do to defend against similar intrusions and most involve hardening identity security and access management. First off: apply principles of least privilege to all IAM users and roles.

Sysdig also recommends restricting UpdateFunctionConfiguration and PassRole permission in Lambda, limiting UpdateFunctionCode permissions to specific functions and assigning them only to identities that need code deployment capabilities to do their jobs.

Also, make sure S3 buckets containing sensitive data, including RAG data and AI model artifacts, are not publicly accessible.

And it&#39;s a good idea to enable model invocation logging for Amazon Bedrock to detect unauthorized usage.

We reached out to Amazon for comment, but they said they wouldn&#39;t be able to get us anything by publication time. We&#39;ll update this story with any relevant information we receive from them. ®

            <p><strong>The Register | 2026-02-04</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2026/02/04/anthropic_no_advertising_in_claude/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Anthropic has taken the high road by committing to keep its Claude AI model family free of advertising.

&quot;There are many good places for advertising,&quot; the company announced on Wednesday. &quot;A conversation with Claude is not one of them.&quot;

Rival OpenAI has taken a different path and is planning to present promotional material to its free and Go tier customers.

With its abjuration of sponsorship, Anthropic is leaning into its messaging that principles matter, a market position reinforced by recent reports about the company&#39;s clash with the Pentagon over safeguards.

&quot;We want Claude to act unambiguously in our users&#39; interests,&quot; the company said. &quot;So we&#39;ve made a choice: Claude will remain ad-free. Our users won&#39;t see &#39;sponsored&#39; links adjacent to their conversations with Claude; nor will Claude&#39;s responses be influenced by advertisers or include third-party product placements our users did not ask for.&quot;

That choice may follow in part from how Anthropic&#39;s customer base, and its path toward possible profitability, differ from rivals.

Anthropic has focused on business customers. According to The Information, &quot;The vast majority of Anthropic&#39;s $4.5 billion in revenue last year stemmed from selling access to its AI models through an application programming interface to coding startups Cursor and Cognition, as well as other companies such as Microsoft and Canva.&quot;

For OpenAI, on the other hand, 75 percent of its revenue comes from consumers, according to Bloomberg. And given the rate at which OpenAI has been spending money – an expected $17 billion in cash burn this year, up from $9 billion in 2025, according to The Economist – ad revenue looks like a necessity.

Other major US AI companies – Google, Meta, Microsoft (to the extent its technology can be disentangled from OpenAI), and xAI – all have substantial advertising operations. (xAI, which acquired X last year, absorbed the social media company&#39;s ad business, said to have generated about $2.26 billion in 2025, according to eMarketer.)

Anthropic&#39;s concern is that serving ads in chat sessions would introduce incentives to maximize engagement. And that might get in the way of making the chatbot helpful and might undermine trust – to the extent people trust error-prone models deemed dangerous enough to need guardrails.

&quot;Users shouldn&#39;t have to second-guess whether an AI is genuinely helping them or subtly steering the conversation towards something monetizable,&quot; the AI biz said.

The incentive to undermine privacy is what worries the Center for Democracy and Technology.

&quot;Business models based on targeted advertising in chatbot outputs, for example, will create incentives to collect as much user information as possible, including potentially from the highly personal conversations some users have with chatbots, which inexorably will raise risks to user privacy,&quot; the advocacy group said in a recent report.

Melissa Anderson, president of Search.com, which offers a free, ad-supported version of ChatGPT for web search, told The Register in a phone interview that she disagrees with Anthropic&#39;s premise that an AI service can&#39;t be neutral while serving ads.

&quot;They&#39;re kind of saying it&#39;s one or the other and I don&#39;t think that&#39;s the case,&quot; Anderson said. &quot;And here&#39;s a great example: The New York Times sells advertising. The Wall Street Journal sells advertising. And so I think what they&#39;re conflating is the concept that maybe advertisers are gonna somehow spoil the editorial content.&quot;

At Search.com and at some of the other large LLMs, she said, there&#39;s a commitment to the natural, organic LLM answer not being affected by advertisers.

Anthropic&#39;s view, she said, is valid but extreme. &quot;The advertising industry for a long time has recognized that having too many ads is definitely a bad thing,&quot; she said. &quot;But it&#39;s possible in a world where there&#39;s the right volume of ads, and those ads are relevant and interesting and helpful to the consumer, then it&#39;s a positive thing.&quot;

Iesha White, director of intelligence for Check My Ads, a non-profit ad watchdog group, took the opposite view, telling The Register in an email, &quot;We applaud Anthropic&#39;s decision to forgo an ad-supported monetization model.

&quot;Anthropic&#39;s recognition of the importance of its role as a true agent of its users is both refreshing and innovative. It puts Anthropic&#39;s trust-centered approach in stark contrast to its peers and incumbents.&quot;

Other AI companies, she said, pointing to Meta, Perplexity, and ChatGPT, have chosen to adopt an ad monetization model that, by design, depends upon user data extraction.

&quot;This data - including people&#39;s deepest thoughts, hopes, and fears -  is then packaged to sell ads to the highest bidders,&quot; said White. &quot;Anthropic has recognized that an ad-supported model would create incentives that undermine user trust as well as the company&#39;s own broader vision. Anthropic&#39;s choice reminds one of Google&#39;s original but now jettisoned motto, &#39;Don&#39;t be evil.&#39; Let&#39;s hope that Anthropic&#39;s resolve to do right by its customers is stronger than Google&#39;s was.&quot; ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Attackers are exploiting a critical SolarWinds Web Help Desk bug - less than a week after the vendor disclosed and fixed the 9.8-rated flaw. That&#39;s according to America&#39;s lead cyber-defense agency, which set a Friday deadline for federal agencies to patch the security flaw.

The vulnerability under attack, CVE-2025-40551, is an untrusted deserialization flaw that can lead to remote code execution, allowing a remote, unauthenticated attacker to execute OS commands on the affected system.

SolarWinds fixed the security hole, along with five others, in Web Help Desk version 2026.1, released on January 28. Horizon3.ai and watchTowr researchers reported these six bugs to the software vendor, with Horizon3 warning that &quot;these vulnerabilities are easily exploitable.&quot;

While there weren&#39;t any known cases of in-the-wild exploitation at the time of disclosure, Rapid7 threat hunters said &quot;we expect this to change as and when technical details become available.&quot;

Plus, they pointed out, SolarWinds&#39; Web Help Desk product has made two previous appearances, both times in 2024, in CISA&#39;s Known Exploited Vulnerabilities catalog, &quot;indicating that it is a target for real-world attackers.&quot;

These were CVE-2024-28987, a critical, hardcoded login credential bug and CVE-2024-28986, a deserialization RCE vulnerability that was patched three times before the fix worked and attackers weren&#39;t able to bypass it.

While we don&#39;t know who is attacking the latest Web Help Desk vulnerability, or what they are doing with the access to vulnerable machines, the abbreviated deadline for federal agencies to fix indicates a serious threat.

Federal agencies are typically required to remediate known exploited vulnerabilities within 14 days of the bugs being added to the catalog. In urgent cases, however, CISA sets a shorter deadline, usually a week, but in this case of CVE-2025-40551, it&#39;s just three days.

A SolarWinds spokesperson told The Register that the company is &quot;aware of the reported issues,&quot; and recommended customers apply the updated, patched software &quot;promptly.&quot;

&quot;Based on our review, we have not observed widespread exploitation, and we are continuing to monitor the situation and partner with customers closely,&quot; the spokesperson said. ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Software stocks have taken a beating over the last month as investors grow concerned that AI could put vertical SaaS vendors out of business.

The downturn is remarkable for analysts in the tech sector who have seen top SaaS companies grow revenues by 20% or more each year, year after year.

“I think that investors are uncertain about SaaS stocks and how they create value,” Lisa Lawson, analyst with Omedia told The Register. “SaaS has been so lucky in that they’ve experienced double-digit [revenue] growth for a very long time. Like pretty impressive double-digit growth for a long time. Now that growth isn’t just based on how they can be more efficient. It’s that they have new competition in the form of OpenAI and Anthropic. So yes. Investors are concerned about how SaaS can continue to grow, and prove its value and price points.”

In the last month Adobe, Microsoft, Salesforce, SAP, ServiceNow and Oracle have shed more than $730 billion in value as of Tuesday&#39;s market close.

The iShares Expanded Tech Software Sector ETF, which houses 114 of the largest software stocks, is down 19 percent from a month ago, erasing the gains it has made since last April, and it is now nearly 30 percent off its high in September.

During ServiceNow’s earnings call last week, CEO Bill McDermott attributed the downturn to his company’s M&A strategy, which he said likely resulted in the loss of $10 billion in market cap. He told analysts on the call that the company was done making acquisitions.

“So now the worry is gone, you can give us back to market cap,” he said on the Jan. 28 call.

Alas, investors have only punished the stock more since they hung up the phone, sending share prices down 18 percent and erasing an additional $20 billion-plus from its market cap. The ITSM superstar that is used by enterprises around the world and posted strong earnings has lost $115 billion in market value since Jan. 5.

Lawson said there are reasons to be worried that this is not a blip.

“Just in January, both OpenAI and Anthropic announced a HIPAA-compliant life sciences health care tool that does directly compete against the Veevas of the world, and the Salesforce life sciences offerings,” Lawson said. “These are very specific examples of these AI first companies directly competing with SaaS and directly competing with both the platforms and vertical solutions, and point solutions.”

Those moves by two of the largest foundation models echo the warning that Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella issued a year ago, when he said AI agents posed a risk to SaaS companies. Over the last month, no software stock has lost more value than Microsoft: more than $450 billion in value as of close on Feb. 3.

“I think the notion that business applications exist, that’s probably where they will all collapse in the agent era, because if you think about it, they are essentially CRUD databases with a bunch of business logic. The business logic is all going to these agents. These agents are going to be multi-repo CRUD,” Nadella said on the Bg2 Pod referring to multi-repository create, read, update, delete databases. “They’re not going to discriminate between what the back end is. They’re going to update multiple databases and all the logic will be in the AI tier so to speak. Once the AI tier becomes the place where the logic is, then people will start replacing the backends.”

Nadella later compared it to the shift that happened when the relational database was created and separated the data tier from the application, which allowed developers to build business logic on top of the database.

“So the CRUD database will then get orchestrated outside of the business logic tier of the SaaS application is what’s going to happen,” he said.

However, Forrester vice president and principal analyst Charles Betz told The Register he doubts that will happen on a large scale.

“I don’t subscribe to his point of view for this simple reason: there are about 20,000 legal jurisdictions worldwide and complying with applicable regulation is a major reason why people trust vendors like SAP,” he said. “At the very least, we are many years away from agentic systems being able to ingest regulations and comply with them in the systems they are going to generate on the fly.”

Betz said AI is shaping customer behavior, but he sees it being used to support buying decisions, rather than a wholesale replacement of SaaS stacks. Besides, running a software stack is a lot of work.

“Even if you are using an AI to maintain it, keeping software up to date is a chore and a cost,” he said. “The economics of SaaS may change, I don’t doubt that. But this idea it evaporates? Nah.”

That’s the same point made by managed service provider Jason Slagle, CEO of CNWR Inc., which installs and operates massive hardware and software deployments, dealing with dozens of vendors, for customers across the US.

“So someone vibe codes some AI slop to do business functions. How do they maintain it? I see things integrating into Hubspot or Salesforce, not replacing it,” he told The Register. “That isn’t to say there won’t be corrections. There are a ton of underwhelming SaaS applications that are features not products. Those will be the ones to go. The stocks that are getting a beating are a correction from a huge overvaluation that we’ve seen for a number of years. That overvaluation is just moving to AI.” ®

            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2026/02/04/army_bots_cleanup_ai_biological_chemical/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">It&#39;s bot versus bot! Just in time for the predicted rise of AI-made biological and chemical weapons, the US Army has plans to fight autonomy with autonomy by getting its hands on some bot-based chemical weapon cleanup tech.

The Army recently published a Request For Information on Autonomous Decontamination Systems (ADS) to see what might be out there in the existing commercial market to help its Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear (CBRN) troops more easily clean up contaminated vehicles, infrastructure, and terrain.

&quot;ADS will reduce manpower and optimize resources required for decontamination operations while mitigating the risk of exposure of warfighters to Chemical and Biological Warfare Agents through robotic means,&quot; the Army said in its RFI.

The Army sees its auto-decontamination machines fitting into platoon-sized groups (40 soldiers or so), where they&#39;ll be able to conduct full cleaning cycles, spraying decontaminants and rinsing objects with water. The branch is also looking for ADS to be capable of &quot;precision contamination mapping&quot; using &quot;surface indication technologies to identify, digitize, and track the contamination footprint&quot; as well as &quot;post-decontamination assessment.&quot;

In short, the Army wants to get its CBRN troops out of harm&#39;s way and leave the dirty work to the bots.

The RFI notes that the Army is seeking tethered and untethered drones to serve as part of ADS, with aerial and ground units to be used for detection of contaminants and actual cleaning work, and it wants bots transportable by light and medium tactical vehicles (i.e., trucks, not armored units like the Stryker or a Humvee).

Since this is just an RFI, there&#39;s no indication if or when the Army might acquire ADS units, or which it might select from the ones presented - if any. The filing notes the branch isn&#39;t asking for pricing or other details and is just seeking information about the feasibility of such tech.

We reached out to the Army to learn more about ADS, including whether it&#39;s something the Army is definitely planning to develop and on what timeline, but didn&#39;t immediately hear back.

The fact that the Army is seeking autonomous CBRN cleanup units makes perfect sense given the warnings presented by AI experts in recent years.

Pharmaceutical researchers said in 2022 that AI algorithms used to generate therapeutic drugs could easily be tweaked to produce bioweapons, and last year Stanford bioengineers used a synthetic AI-generated bacteriophage that was able to modify E. coli bacteria into a fa more infectious form.

Speaking to Congress in 2023, Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei predicted that AI like the ones his company makes would be advanced enough to develop bioweapons in as little as two or three years. In other words, by 2026 or so.

&quot;Today, certain steps in the use of biology to create harm involve knowledge that cannot be found on Google or in textbooks and requires a high level of specialized expertise,&quot; Amodei told Senators. &quot;If we don&#39;t have things in place that are restraining what can be done with AI systems, we&#39;re going to have a really bad time.&quot;

That was three years ago, and it&#39;s safe to say little to no progress has been made in reining in the threats posed by malicious AI since then. ®

            <h2>Server CPUs join memory in the supply shortage, pushing up prices</h2>
            <p><strong>The Register | 2026-02-04</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2026/02/04/server_cpus_memory_shortage/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Datacenter servers will face a double whammy this year as CPU supply constraints pile on top of an already severe memory shortage. Even so, shipments are still expected to grow at a double-digit rate.

The latest Cloud and Datacenter Market Snapshot [PDF] from analyst firm Omdia says that server CPUs are also experiencing supply constraints that are likely to see prices rise, with a knock-on effect on overall system costs.

Omdia claims this is at least partly due to the difficulty of shifting production volume across different process nodes. As CPU roadmaps have broadened, vendors are simultaneously manufacturing processors on different process nodes such as 3 nm or 5 nm.

&quot;The nature of processor design and fabrication is such that shifting volume across process nodes is complex and time consuming,&quot; the firm says, adding that lower-than-expected yields may have also contributed to the shortage.

The upshot is that Omdia believes server CPU prices could increase by 11 to 15 percent as a consequence of the shortfall in supply. And this is a conservative estimate, based on the fact that the biggest customers – the hyperscale cloud operators - will typically have fixed their prices beforehand through long-term agreements with vendors.

Any CPU issues will add to an already challenging IT supply chain situation driven largely by the memory shortage. The cost of DRAM is expected to nearly double this quarter, as The Register reported just days ago, while NAND flash used in solid-state storage is also forecast to rise by more than 30 percent.

DRAM is in particularly short supply because of high demand and because the memory chipmakers have repurposed manufacturing capacity to focus on making more of the high-margin products such as high-bandwidth memory (HBM) used in GPU accelerators for AI processing.

Omdia says that it is concerned that memory availability could disrupt server manufacturing output, which might in turn affect the completion dates for ongoing datacenter projects.

Despite this, the analyst firm still foresees a 12 percent growth in server shipments this year, thanks to a refresh cycle covering general-purpose servers that is also boosting shipments. It regards memory availability as much more of a risk than CPU availability.

Meanwhile, when it comes to racks packed with AI servers and GPUs, Omdia estimates that at least 71,000 racks will ship this year with more than 100 kW of IT load, largely driven by Nvidia&#39;s NVL72 integrated system.

Thanks to the seemingly insatiable demand for AI infrastructure, Omdia forecasts that this will increase by 56 percent next year, and we will see the first ultra-dense racks with upwards of 200 kW of equipment.

But it isn&#39;t likely to end there. Last year, Google detailed plans for future 1 MW IT racks at the Open Compute Project (OCP) Summit in Dublin. ®

            <p><strong>The Verge | 2026-02-04</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theverge.com/news/874084/ai-chatgpt-claude-super-bowl-ads-openai-anthropic">Visit Original Website</a>

            <div id="article-text">The OpenAI boss said Anthropic’s portrayal of how ads impact ChatGPT is ‘clearly dishonest.’

The OpenAI boss said Anthropic’s portrayal of how ads impact ChatGPT is ‘clearly dishonest.’

Sam Altman responded to Anthropic’s new Super Bowl ad in an X post on Wednesday, saying the OpenAI competitor’s campaign is “clearly dishonest,” and called it “on brand” for Anthropic to “doublespeak.” “We would obviously never run ads in the way Anthropic depicts them,” he wrote. “We are not stupid and we know our users would reject that.” You can read his statement in full, below.

Anthropic, founded in 2021 by ex-OpenAI research executives who reportedly left over differences in opinions on AI safety and mission, doesn’t mention OpenAI or ChatGPT by name in its Super Bowl Sunday ad campaign. But in contrast to OpenAI’s January news that it would soon start testing ads, Anthropic says, “Our users won’t see ‘sponsored’ links adjacent to their conversations with Claude; nor will Claude’s responses be influenced by advertisers or include third-party product placements our users did not ask for.”

OpenAI says its ad test will only appear for logged-in users on free or ChatGPT Go accounts, while maintaining that “Ads do not influence the answers ChatGPT gives you. Answers are optimized based on what’s most helpful to you. Ads are always separate and clearly labeled.” According to Altman, OpenAI’s Super Bowl ad is “about builders, and how anyone can now build anything.”

First, the good part of the Anthropic ads: they are funny, and I laughed.

But I wonder why Anthropic would go for something so clearly dishonest. Our most important principle for ads says that we won’t do exactly this; we would obviously never run ads in the way Anthropic depicts them. We are not stupid and we know our users would reject that.

I guess it’s on brand for Anthropic doublespeak to use a deceptive ad to critique theoretical deceptive ads that aren’t real, but a Super Bowl ad is not where I would expect it.

More importantly, we believe everyone deserves to use AI and are committed to free access, because we believe access creates agency. More Texans use ChatGPT for free than total people use Claude in the US, so we have a differently-shaped problem than they do. (If you want to pay for ChatGPT Plus or Pro, we don’t show you ads.)

Anthropic serves an expensive product to rich people. We are glad they do that and we are doing that too, but we also feel strongly that we need to bring AI to billions of people who can’t pay for subscriptions.

Maybe even more importantly: Anthropic wants to control what people do with AI—they block companies they don’t like from using their coding product (including us), they want to write the rules themselves for what people can and can’t use AI for, and now they also want to tell other companies what their business models can be.

We are committed to broad, democratic decision making in addition to access. We are also committed to building the most resilient ecosystem for advanced AI. We care a great deal about safe, broadly beneficial AGI, and we know the only way to get there is to work with the world to prepare.

One authoritarian company won’t get us there on their own, to say nothing of the other obvious risks. It is a dark path.

As for our Super Bowl ad: it’s about builders, and how anyone can now build anything.

We are enjoying watching so many people switch to Codex. There have now been 500,000 app downloads since launch on Monday, and we think builders are really going to love what’s coming in the next few weeks. I believe Codex is going to win.

We will continue to work hard to make even more intelligence available for lower and lower prices to our users.

This time belongs to the builders, not the people who want to control them.

Tech surrenders to the daily chaos of Washington politicking.

Hello and welcome to Regulator, a newsletter for Verge subscribers about the most ambitious crossover event of all time: the infinity war between technology and politics. Not subscribed yet? Come on, do it!

Washington might seem slower than Silicon Valley. But that’s because it’s more turbulent. In order to achieve anything, one has to navigate the sheer amount of chaos that emerges when thousands of federal elected officials, staffers, political appointees, lobbyists, corporations, lawyers, journalists, and influencers are trying to push their interests, often at the same time.

For the past 20-odd issues of Regulator, I’ve written weekly about the big stories in tech’s growing influence in Washington, both as a tool used by politicians to achieve power and as an industry trying to bend the laws in its favor. But over the past year, it’s become harder to declare that there’s only one big story every week. So many new technologies are the subject of heated political debate — semiconductors, artificial intelligence, crypto, social media, surveillance, just to name a few — that to single one out every week seems like it barely scratches the surface of the action happening everywhere in town.

So this week, I’m spilling the notes and plotlines I’ve collected in the course of reporting, as well as some of the most eyebrow-raising stories I’ve come across. Shockingly, even though the District is virtually iced in, and even outside of the partial shutdown, there’s been a lot of action...

Protracted negotiations alert: The House has narrowly voted to avert a partial government shutdown on Tuesday afternoon, but has publicly given its demands for ICE reforms: judge-issued warrants for arrests, enforcement of agents wearing bodycams (a Verge favorite), and making ICE agents remove their masks. The Republicans are countering with a request to revoke funding for “sanctuary cities.” But of course, anything can change in an instant…

Epstein alert: After a testy back-and-forth between their lawyers and the House Oversight Committee, Bill and Hillary Clinton have agreed to testify in front of Congress about their relationship with Jeffrey Epstein at the end of the month, narrowly avoiding a vote to hold them in contempt. They also agreed to have their testimonies filmed and transcribed, so prepare your ctrl+F keys to search the DOJ’s Epstein Files database for names dropped.

Celebrity alert: Actor Joseph Gordon-Levitt will appear with Sen. Dick Durbin (D-IL) to celebrate the 30th anniversary of the passage of Section 230 in a press conference on Capitol Hill.

On Monday, the White House held a meeting with the policy directors of several major crypto companies, trade associations, and representatives from traditional financial institutions to hammer out an agreement on the Clarity Act. The crypto market structure bill has been in limbo after Coinbase abruptly revoked its support, citing its current language on stablecoin yields. According to a readout from Cody Carbone of The Digital Chamber, a trade association representing the digital asset industry, “the political rhetoric was toned down” and the invited parties eventually agreed to aim for a compromise by the end of February.

Notably, the negotiation was between the policy directors of these institutions, and not the CEOs of those companies — which makes sense, considering reports from Davos. The Wall Street Journal reported on Friday that Coinbase’s Brian Armstrong got into several confrontations with Wall Street CEOs during the World Economic Forum who were offended that he’d publicly accused traditional banks of sabotaging the bill against the crypto industry. The most Succession-y kerfuffle: JPMorganChase’s Jamie Dimon interrupting Armstrong’s coffee date with former UK Prime Minister Tony Blair to accuse him of being “full of shit.” (Personally, I suspect that billionaires prefer fighting in Davos over negotiating in Washington, but that’s just me.)

Semafor reported Friday that Michael Grimes, a longtime Elon Musk associate and banker, is leaving the Trump administration. Since joining the administration in early 2025, Grimes led the Commerce Department’s venture investment arm, which gutted funding for the CHIPS Act, purchased a stake in Intel, and will eventually hold $1 trillion from East Asian trade deals to invest in other tech companies. (The venture is, incidentally, operating without congressional approval.) The division will now be run by Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, as well as a group of Wall Street investors, and is currently scouting new potential investment projects.

The Wall Street Journal reports that just days before Donald Trump’s second inauguration, Sheikh Tahnoon bin Zayed Al Nahyan, an extremely powerful Abu Dhabi royal known as the “spy sheikh,” signed off on a deal to purchase a 49 percent stake in World Liberty Financial — the crypto company owned by the Trump family — for roughly half a billion dollars, paying $187 million upfront to Trump-controlled entities. Shortly thereafter, the United Arab Emirates managed to secure approval to purchase 500,000 advanced AI chips, despite concerns that Tahnoon’s AI firm is slightly too close to the Chinese-owned Huawei for the State Department’s comfort.

Disgraced FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried, who was convicted on several counts of financial crimes and sentenced to prison, is trying once again to convince people that he’s actually a Republican victim of the “woke mob,” this time making the case on X. (It’s the second time that the former efficient altruist and Dem megadonor has attempted to look redpilled.)

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Overwatch 2, the sequel to Activision Blizzard’s hit hero shooter Overwatch, was announced in 2019 but didn’t arrive for another three years, eventually bringing a shift to five-on-five matches in PVP, and a few new characters, including Overwatch’s first Black female hero.

After canceling planned PvE content and unlocking its hero pool, the game’s developers eventually brought back a lot of things, like 6v6 gameplay, loot boxes, and, in 2026, its name. Overwatch 2 is now just Overwatch again.

Catch up on The Verge’s coverage of the game right here.

Just a few years after Overwatch 2’s free-to-play 5v5 replaced the original, Blizzard announced it’s dropping the “2.” There’s been a steady flow of other changes lately (like the return of 6v6), but the plan for this next year includes 10 new heroes (Domina, Emre, Mizuki, Anran, and Jetpack Cat arrive when S1 launches February 10th), new maps, menu updates, a Conquest meta event, Reign of Talon narrative arc, and more.

Today, Blizzard released an initial gameplay trailer for the Stadium mode it’s adding to Overwatch 2 soon, along with more details in a blog post. Like many other battlers before it, and Apex Legends’ now-discarded Arenas, it puts the game’s characters (17 of them to start) into a 5v5, multi-round best-of-seven format, with the ability to earn and swap out special abilities as the rounds progress.

It also offers a third-person perspective option like Marvel Rivals, and will launch on April 22nd.

Overwatch 2 is getting quite the shakeup in 2025 as it faces growing competition from other online shooters. It starts with the season 15 update that’s coming on February 18th that’ll tease a new hero and introduce an in-game Perks system for existing ones, plus the return of the 6v6 competitive queues Blizzard tested late last year. There’s also the return of loot boxes and then, in April, a Counterstrike-like mode, two new characters, and a revamped ranked queue that lets you ban heroes and vote on maps.

Reintroducing loot boxes may be a polarizing move, as games that implement them have received backlash over the years for their predatory nature. Blizzard removed them from Overwatch a few years ago in favor of an in-game shop when it restructured its monetization model after going free-to-play. The company will responsibly publicize drop rates and is guaranteeing that you’ll receive an item of “Rare” rarity or better in each box, plus a guaranteed “Epic” after opening five and a “Legendary” after opening 20. We’re not sure whether you’ll still be able to purchase cosmetics directly from a rotating in-game shop, but you can earn loot boxes as part of weekly and event rewards, and you can get up to three guaranteed Legendary loot boxes in each seasonal battle pass.

Marvel Rivals already catered directly to existing Overwatch fans with its 6v6 team hero shooter gameplay. Now, its Spring Festival event will follow the season one launch with a 3v3 Rocket League-style limited-time mode that looks just like Overwatch’s Lucioball.

Naturally, there are various unlockables and some new costumes that will become available after the spring event starts on January 23rd at 4AM ET.

After abandoning the 6v6 format years ago, the latest Overwatch 2 patch will test its return. From now until January 6th, you can play Overwatch as it was originally conceived with two tanks, two damage dealers, and two healers on each team. Six vs. six matches will be unranked and certain heroes have had their abilities tweaked to better suit the new but also old format.

Last year’s Fortnite OG event has attracted a new round of free-to-play copycats.

Apex Legends responded to revenue that EA execs said “fell short of expectations” with a “Launch Royale” revisiting the original map and characters until November 19th. And now, Blizzard announced Overwatch Classic is coming tomorrow with 6v6, no-limits gameplay like Overwatch had at its very beginning.

A couple of years into the Overwatch 2 experience, player angst has reached a point where the people making the game are considering bringing the old 12-person matches back. Today’s blog post from the developers at Blizzard says that, finally, “we’re exploring how we can test different forms of 6v6 in the game to gauge the results.”

Game director Aaron Keller also notes that issues like hero balancing, game performance, and what might happen to queue times if players have a choice between the two formats are questions the team needs to answer but is at least ready to start considering.

Like Rainbow Six Siege, Call of Duty, and Destiny 2, the developers of Overwatch 2 are going after players who use “unapproved peripherals” to combine the precision of mouse and keyboard controls with the aim assist granted to controller players.

Over the next few weeks, there will be permanent account bans against players who are the most severe abusers of unapproved peripherals. These actions will be targeted towards high-ranked players who have been reported by others and who our data clearly shows are using an unapproved peripheral.

It’s April Fools’ Day, so the googly eyes are back in Overwatch 2, complete with other extremely balanced adjustments (Lifeweaver’s platform goes way, way up now, and Mercy is armed and dangerous), plus some special challenges and sprays that players can earn.

Overwatch 2 heroes will no longer need to be unlocked through Battle Pass or via purchase, taking some of the grind out of the now free-to-play team FPS. Starting in Season 10, players will be able to unlock all existing and future heroes for free. This will include Venture, the latest hero joining Overwatch’s roster next season.

New players to the game will still need to complete the first-time user experience. Only when novice players have unlocked the heroes from the first Overwatch roster will all Overwatch 2 heroes then be at their disposal, , as game director Aaron Keller explains in the latest Developer’s Update video.

Over the next couple of hours, the two games I play the most are releasing massive updates, with changes to ranked tier systems, character abilities, and either 120Hz refresh rates or new bullet sizes.

With games like Baldur’s Gate 3 and Spider-Man 2 atop the sales charts, these live service games need something new to keep going — and hopefully, with these changes they find it.

Apex Legends Breakout season starts at 1PM ET, and Overwatch 2 starts season 9 at 2PM ET

The day Overwatch League fans have braced for has finally come. Yesterday, OverActive Media, parent company for the Toronto Defiant, confirmed its exit from the Overwatch League. The company announced that as a part of its agreement with Activision Blizzard, it would receive a $6 million termination fee, thereby ending all its commitments to the League. This confirms that a majority of teams have met and voted to terminate their agreements with the League, with each team owner receiving a termination fee. The result is that the Overwatch League is finally ending after six seasons.

“We are transitioning from the Overwatch League and evolving competitive Overwatch in a new direction,” said John Nomis, associate PR manager for the Overwatch League, in a statement to The Verge. “We are grateful to everyone who made OWL possible and remain focused on building our vision of a revitalized esports program. We are excited to share details with you all in the near future.”

Hours after the Florida Mayhem were crowned the 2023 Overwatch League Grand Champions, the Overwatch League itself has likely come to its end. In a post on X (formerly Twitter) this morning, Blizzard said that it’s working on “building our vision of a revitalized esports program.”

It is no secret that the league has been in dire straits. Over the last few years, there were numerous reports that the league was struggling financially. Advertisers had pulled out after stories of sexual harassment and abuse at Blizzard broke in 2021. Team organizations were struggling to pay franchising fees, strained by the depressed economic conditions facilitated by the covid-19 pandemic. One team, the Chengdu Hunters, disbanded entirely in the middle of the 2023 season. And finally, after failing to renegotiate a deal with its Chinese publishing partner, NetEase, some Blizzard games went offline in China — one of Overwatch’s biggest markets — and remain offline to this day.

Overwatch 2’s Invasion event, which goes live today, is the game’s biggest update since penciling in the “2” in October of last year. The event, which coincides with season 6 of the battle pass, offers a new hero, a new game mode, and, perhaps most importantly, new story missions that, for the first time, advance Overwatch’s story. And while I appreciate and enjoy all the new coming to Overwatch 2, I can’t shake the feeling that this all feels too little and too late.

Flashpoint is Overwatch 2’s newest game mode. Teams fight to control one of five points spread out equally on maps that are the largest in the game. Each point unlocks sequentially, and once a team reaches 100 percent control, the next point unlocks. The first team to three points wins.

Overwatch 2’s Invasion event will not only introduce fans to the new story missions and a new game mode, but it’ll also introduce us to a new hero. Meet Illari. She was teased back in June, and now, with a new trailer released today for Overwatch 2 season six, fans can get a first look at the new support hero.

Never running from a mech fight, she is the one named Sou-o-journ. And now her very first story cinematic can be viewed on YouTube after its exclusive launch in the Overwatch 2 game client.

In the last week, popular Twitch streamers, including Shroud and Scump, have had their Overwatch 2 streams “hijacked” by a mysterious force known only as The Enigma. Today, Blizzard revealed that The Enigma is none other than John Cena promoting Overwatch 2’s new story missions that drop with the Invasion event on August 10th.

From the first reveal of her character in a small thumbnail portrait in 2016 to her official debut in Overwatch 2 some six years later, Vivian Chase, call sign Sojourn, has been on a journey. Today, that long journey takes a new direction as Blizzard reveals her first animated short, bringing newfound depth to her character and to the Overwatch franchise overall.

In an exclusive interview with The Verge, Sojourn’s creators talk about her new cinematic and her place at the center of Overwatch 2’s story.

You’re gonna have to pay to play Overwatch 2’s new story missions.

During Xbox’s Summer Game Fest presentation, we got a tease of Overwatch 2’s story missions. Though the content won’t be arriving until August 6th, a Game Informer story and a developer blog shared details about the new story missions, including one big, unexpected twist: that unlike any new game mode or seasonal event that’s launched after Overwatch 2 went free-to-play, these story missions would not be free.

Overwatch 2 will celebrate its first-ever Pride event. Starting June 1st, the Midtown map will be festooned with Pride flags, the lesbian hero Tracer will have a picture of her and her partner added to the barracks in the Watchpoint: Gibraltar map, and players will get a host of icons and name cards reflect the breadth of queer identities and the Overwatch heroes who share them. The Verge had the opportunity to speak with the developers about this new event, gaining insight into what went into creating this event and what this means for Overwatch’s LGBTQ+ fans and characters.

“We want it to feel like the game is reflecting what’s happening in the real world. We do it for Halloween. We do it for Lunar New Year, too,” said game director Aaron Keller during the interview. “It’s important to carry this forward for Pride as well.”

Game director Aaron Keller published a blog in which he apologized for the seemingly sudden cancellation of a portion of Overwatch 2’s PvE content. The blog also shared some detail about the origins of Overwatch PvE, the shifting vision for the content, and why the team decided to axe it.

Earlier this week, in a developer livestream that shared the rest of Overwatch 2’s 2023 roadmap, Keller and executive producer Jared Neuss made the shocking announcement that highly anticipated Hero Mode — one part of the game’s PvE content — had been scrapped.

Overwatch 2’s long-awaited hero missions PvE mode is no more. In a developer livestream, game director Aaron Keller said that the team is canceling the game’s PvE-based hero missions in favor of continuing on with seasonal, story-focused events.

When Blizzard first announced Overwatch 2, the developers teased that the game would have two PvE campaign modes adjacent to its traditional competitive modes.

Lifeweaver, Overwatch 2’s latest support hero is live. The flower powered hero comes with the arrival of season 4 which features a fun space opera theme, highlighting once again that the Overwatch 2 skin department does not miss.

I haven’t gotten emotional over an Overwatch trailer since the Overwatch 2 launch trailer. But the trailer for season 4 finally got me. Beyond teasing the season’s new skins, which feature a galactic space pirate theme, and the release of the newest hero Liveweaver, the season 4 trailer feels like it’s Overwatch returning to its narrative roots of hope, optimism, and inclusion.

Overwatch, since inception, has been about an idealistic set of cosmopolitan heroes coming together to save a world in crisis. That message is in the game’s DNA with its bright colors, futuristic aesthetic, and Tracer’s signature line, “Cheers, love, the cavalry’s here.” I wouldn’t say Overwatch 2 has gotten away from that message, but it’s been de-emphasized in favor of the necessities that come with being a product that’s meant to make money. We get the flashy skins, the balance updates, the events, and all the various and sundry things designed to keep players engaged and spending. And make no mistake, that’s present in today’s trailer and accompanying blog highlighting all the new stuff coming in season 4. (My favorite of which is the new PvP event that pits two space-faring factions against each other in a war for the fate of the galaxy.)

Overwatch 2 has been releasing new heroes at a pretty good clip, and with the pending arrival of season 4 comes the latest hero: Lifeweaver. Lifeweaver’s addition to the game had been teased by the Overwatch developers in the last few weeks, with them calling the new hero “cute,” leading some in the Overwatch community to speculate that we’d be getting another animal-based hero like the much-desired “jetpack cat.”

But thanks to an unfortunate leak and the slow drip of information ahead of his official launch, we now know the developers should have used “sexy” instead of “cute” because Lifeweaver is a stone-cold fox.

Onboarding and connectivity issues are plaguing the furniture retailer’s new Matter-over-Thread products.

I’ve spent the last couple of weeks trying — and mostly failing — to test Ikea’s new Matter-over-Thread gear. These highly anticipated smart home devices include programmable buttons, smart bulbs, plugs, and temperature and motion sensors — all of which should work with any smart home platform and start at just $6.

But I’ve hit several walls trying to connect them to any smart home platform, and I’m not alone. The Tradfri subreddit is filled with Ikea customers sharing similar frustrations, reviews on Ikea’s website point to issues, and colleagues at The Verge have also been having problems.

Of the six devices I’ve tried to connect, I’ve so far successfully onboarded just one Kajplats smart lightbulb to Apple Home — after seven attempts — and one Alpstuga IAQ monitor to Home Assistant — after failing to pair with Apple Home.

A Bilresa smart button initially connected to Amazon Alexa, then fell off the network and refused to re-pair. The Timmerflotte temperature sensor and Myggspray motion sensor just flat-out refused to connect to anything, even Ikea’s own Dirigera hub.

“We are aware that some customers are experiencing connection issues when setting up their devices in certain home environments, and we take that very seriously.”

While plenty of people have had no problems, there have been enough posts on user forums about being unable to connect the new devices — or struggling through multiple resets before pairing — to suggest my issues weren’t just a result of my wildly overcomplicated network, and could be indicative of a bigger problem. One Reddit user posted a particularly eyebrow-raising example: of the 60 Ikea Bilresa buttons they tried to pair, only 31 connected, for a 52 percent success rate.

Additionally, after a few weeks in people’s homes, a handful of users are now reporting trouble keeping devices connected once they’re finally paired. The Verge’s David Pierce had this problem with the Bilresa smart button connected via Amazon Alexa, and a few users on the Ikea Tradfri subreddit have had issues with the Kajplats light bulbs.

These are Ikea’s first products to use Matter-over-Thread, rather than Zigbee, the connectivity protocol its previous Tradfri smart home line relied on. The main benefit of Matter is that devices should connect directly to any of the major platforms — Apple Home, Google Home, Amazon Alexa, Samsung SmartThings — without needing Ikea’s Dirigera hub or a cloud connection. You should also be able to connect to more than one platform through Matter’s multi-admin feature. Right now, I’d settle for being able to connect to just one!

I reached out to Ikea, and David Granath, range manager for smart home at Ikea, told me they are aware of the problems and are investigating. “The launch of our Matter range has been highly anticipated, and for most customers the products work seamlessly, as intended,” he said. “That said, we are aware that some customers are experiencing connection issues when setting up their devices in certain home environments, and we take that very seriously.

“We have a dedicated team reviewing the raised concerns and working closely with our ecosystem partners, and the Connectivity Standards Alliance, to better understand the issues and improve the experience,” Granath continued, adding that the team will share more when they can. In the meantime, they offered some troubleshooting tips.

The rollout of new technology is often fraught with issues, as Ikea knows well. And as Granath implied, the sheer variety of network setups and environments in the smart home can be hard to anticipate. It’s only once products hit the real world that some issues become visible. But while connectivity and setup failures initially plagued Matter devices, a concerted push by the CSA last year appears to have fixed most of them.

The difference here could be that this is one of the first large-scale deployments of Matter-over-Thread devices. As I’ve reported previously, the Thread network infrastructure is not only confusing for users but also the least robust, thanks in part to the ongoing lack of interoperability among Thread border routers.

However, the fact that so many people are experiencing problems suggests a bigger issue than just users’ setups. What that issue is remains unclear; it could be how Ikea implemented the Matter spec, an issue with how the devices interact with specific platforms, or something in the Matter spec itself.

Ikea, the CSA, and the platform makers need to figure this out quickly. The launch of Ikea’s inexpensive Matter devices was supposed to be a breakthrough moment for the smart home — proof that the standard was finally ready for the mass market. Instead, it’s looking like yet another reminder that in the smart home, the hardest part is still just getting things to work.

Security researchers found hundreds of malicious add-ons on ClawHub.

If you buy something from a Verge link, Vox Media may earn a commission. See our ethics statement.

OpenClaw, the AI agent that has exploded in popularity over the past week, is raising new security concerns after researchers uncovered malware in hundreds of user-submitted “skill” add-ons on its marketplace. In a post on Monday, 1Password product VP Jason Meller says OpenClaw’s skill hub has become “an attack surface,” with the most-downloaded add-on serving as a “malware delivery vehicle.”

OpenClaw — first called Clawdbot, then Moltbot — is billed as an AI agent that “actually does things,” such as managing your calendar, checking in for flights, cleaning out your inbox, and more. It runs locally on devices, and users can interact with the AI assistant through messaging apps like WhatsApp, Telegram, iMessage, and others. But some users are giving OpenClaw the ability to access their entire device, allowing it to read and write files, execute scripts, and run shell commands.

While this kind of access poses risks on its own, malware disguised as skills that are supposed to enhance OpenClaw’s capabilities only contribute to concerns. OpenSourceMalware, a platform that tracks the presence of malware across the open-source ecosystem, found that 28 malicious skills were published on the ClawHub skill marketplace between January 27th and 29th, in addition to 386 malicious add-ons that were uploaded between January 31st and February 2nd.

OpenSourceMalware says the skills “masquerade as cryptocurrency trading automation tools and deliver information-stealing malware” and manipulate users into executing malicious code that “steals crypto assets like exchange API keys, wallet private keys, SSH credentials, and browser passwords.”

Meller notes that OpenClaw’s skills are often uploaded as markdown files, which could contain malicious instructions for both users and the AI agent. That’s what he found when examining one of ClawHub’s most popular add-ons, a “Twitter” skill containing instructions for users to navigate to a link “designed to get the agent to run a command” that downloads infostealing malware.

OpenClaw’s creator, Peter Steinberger, is working to address some of these risks, as ClawHub now requires users to have a GitHub account that’s at least one week old to publish a skill. There’s also a new way to report skills, though this doesn’t remove the possibility of malware sneaking onto the platform.

Right now, there are discounts available on the base iPad, the iPad Mini, iPad Air, and even the iPad Pro.

If you buy something from a Verge link, Vox Media may earn a commission. See our ethics statement.

While the best iPad deals usually land during major sale events like Black Friday, many great iPad deals are available outside of those times. The day-to-day discounts come and go like changing winds, so there’s often some amount to be saved, particularly on Apple’s most affordable iPad, the iPad Mini, and the latest iPad Air. Hell, you can even often find discounts on the latest M5 iPad Pro, which is already on sale at multiple retailers. If you don’t need the latest tech, though, now may be a good time to save on the M4 Pro as inventory dwindles.

All that being said, it’s difficult to know where exactly you can find the most notable iPad deals unless you’re scouring the major retailers on a daily basis. But that’s often what our deal hunters at The Verge are doing, so let us help you out. Below, we’ve listed the best deals you can get on each iPad model that is available, from the 11th-gen base iPad to the more powerful models with the M3, M4, and M5 chips.

Apple’s 11th-gen iPad landed on the scene in March 2025. The newest base-model tablet is a fairly iterative update of the prior model, but with 128GB of base storage (as opposed to 64GB) and the A16 Bionic chip, which is nearly 30 percent faster than the A14 chip used in the 10th-gen iPad. However, the newer chip doesn’t support the various Apple Intelligence features introduced in iPadOS 18.1 and subsequent updates. For that, you’ll want to opt for a more recent iPad Air, iPad Mini, or iPad Pro model.

Pricing-wise, the latest iPad starts at $349 with Wi-Fi and 128GB of storage. You can also upgrade to 256GB or 512GB of storage for an additional $100 or $200, respectively, or purchase an LTE model starting at $499. We saw a pretty significant price drop to $279 during Black Friday; But right now, it’s available at Amazon and Target starting at $299.99, which saves you $50. Alternatively, if you need more storage, you might want the 256GB model at Amazon that starts at $399.99 ($50 off), or the 512GB variant at Amazon starting at $599.99 ($50 off).

The seventh-gen iPad Mini is similar in several ways to the previous model, but comes with some big internal upgrades. It includes faster Wi-Fi and USB-C speeds, support for the Apple Pencil Pro, and a newer A17 Pro processor with 8GB of RAM to support Apple Intelligence. Otherwise, it boasts nearly identical specs and features as the last-gen model, meaning it has an 8.3-inch Liquid Retina display and options for 5G. It may not be worth upgrading if you already own a sixth-gen Mini, but newcomers to the category will appreciate the upgrades.

The 2024 iPad Mini starts at $499 with 128GB of storage, which was the price for the previous generation’s 64GB model. Electing for 256GB of storage brings the price up to $599, and the cellular models start at $649. These are some big numbers for a small iPad, so the larger iPad Air might be worth considering if you prefer your dollar to go further with more screen real estate. But if you want an Apple tablet in the smallest possible form factor, this is where the action is.

Right now, the 128GB base model with Wi-Fi is on sale at Amazon starting at $399.99 ($50 off), which is $50 shy of its all-time low of $349 that’s rare to see. If you need additional storage, you can pick up the 256GB variant at Amazon for $569 ($30 off), which is about $90 shy of the lowest price we’ve seen on the step-up configuration.

The 2025 iPad Air is little more than a spec bump over the previous model, with a few technical upgrades that should allow it to last longer into the future than either the entry-level iPad or the last-gen Air. It features an M3 chip with support for Apple Intelligence, plus compatibility with Apple’s latest Magic Keyboard that has a larger trackpad and an extra row of function keys. In short, the Air is a credible laptop replacement.

The 11-inch model starts at $599 and the 13-inch variant $799 — the same price as prior models — but it’s common to see discounts from third-party retailers. Right now, for instance, the 11-inch Air is on sale at Amazon in its base configuration with Wi-Fi and 128GB of storage starting at $489.99 ($110 off). If you need more storage, you can grab the 256GB model at Amazon starting at $589 ($110 off), or the step-up 512GB model at Amazon for $779 ($120 off). All models are currently $30 higher than their lowest-ever costs.

The larger 13-inch model, meanwhile, is on sale at Amazon with Wi-Fi and 128GB of storage starting at $679 ($120 off), which is $30 shy of its best price to date. You can grab the 256GB model at Amazon starting at $779.99 ($120 off), or the step-up 512GB model at Amazon for $979 ($120 off).

While there are some deals floating around for the M4 iPad Pro, we’d argue none of them are particularly noteworthy given the current discounts on the 2025 iPad Pro. Apple’s latest high-end tablet offers a few upgrades over the last-gen model, including a faster M5 chip, a new C1X cellular modem (if you get the cellular version), and an N1 chip that handles Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and Thread. Apple also increased read and write speeds to its memory, and the latest Pro supports fast charging, allowing you to charge it to 50 percent capacity in about 30 minutes.

Although the tablet launched in October, we’re already seeing the price drop at several retailers. The 11-inch base model with 256GB of storage is currently down to $899.99 ($100 off) at Amazon, for instance, while the model with Wi-Fi and 512GB of storage is on sale at Amazon for $1,099 ($100 off). You can snag the configuration with Wi-Fi and 1TB of storage for $1,499 ($100 off) at Amazon.

If you want a larger display, you can get the 13-inch iPad Pro in its 256GB base configuration for $1,149.99 ($150 off) at Amazon, which is the second-best price we’ve seen. The step-up model with Wi-Fi and 512GB of storage is down to $1,349 (also $150 off) at Amazon, while the 1TB model can be had at Amazon for $1,749.99 (about $150 off), roughly $11 more than its lowest price to date.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The previous article in this series, “Rules fail at the prompt, succeed at the boundary,” focused on the first AI-orchestrated espionage campaign and the failure of prompt-level control. This article is the prescription. The question every CEO is now getting from their board is some version of: What do we do about agent risk?

Across recent AI security guidance from standards bodies, regulators, and major providers, a simple idea keeps repeating: treat agents like powerful, semi-autonomous users, and enforce rules at the boundaries where they touch identity, tools, data, and outputs.

The following is an actionable eight-step plan one can ask teams to implement and report against:

These steps help define identity and limit capabilities.

Today, agents run under vague, over-privileged service identities. The fix is straightforward: treat each agent as a non-human principal with the same discipline applied to employees.Every agent should run as the requesting user in the correct tenant, with permissions constrained to that user’s role and geography. Prohibit cross-tenant on-behalf-of shortcuts. Anything high-impact should require explicit human approval with a recorded rationale. That is how Google’s Secure AI Framework (SAIF) and NIST AI’s access-control guidance are meant to be applied in practice.

The CEO question: Can we show, today, a list of our agents and exactly what each is allowed to do?2. Tooling control: Pin, approve, and bound what agents can use

The Anthropic espionage framework worked because the attackers could wire Claude into a flexible suite of tools (e.g., scanners, exploit frameworks, data parsers) through Model Context Protocol, and those tools weren’t pinned or policy-gated.

The defense is to treat toolchains like a supply chain:

This is exactly what OWASP flags under excessive agency and what it recommends protecting against. Under the EU AI Act, designing for such cyber-resilience and misuse resistance is part of the Article 15 obligation to ensure robustness and cybersecurity.

The CEO question: Who signs off when an agent gains a new tool or a broader scope? How does one know?

A common anti-pattern is to give the model a long-lived credential and hope prompts keep it polite. SAIF and NIST argue the opposite: credentials and scopes should be bound to tools and tasks, rotated regularly, and auditable. Agents then request narrowly scoped capabilities through those tools.

In practice, that looks like: “finance-ops-agent may read, but not write, certain ledgers without CFO approval.”

The CEO question: Can we revoke a specific capability from an agent without re-architecting the whole system?

These steps gate inputs, outputs, and constrain behavior.

Most agent incidents start with sneaky data: a poisoned web page, PDF, email, or repository that smuggles adversarial instructions into the system. OWASP’s prompt-injection cheat sheet and OpenAI’s own guidance both insist on strict separation of system instructions from user content and on treating unvetted retrieval sources as untrusted.

Operationally, gate before anything enters retrieval or long-term memory: new sources are reviewed, tagged, and onboarded; persistent memory is disabled when untrusted context is present; provenance is attached to each chunk.

The CEO question: Can we enumerate every external content source our agents learn from, and who approved them?

In the Anthropic case, AI-generated exploit code and credential dumps flowed straight into action. Any output that can cause a side effect needs a validator between the agent and the real world. OWASP’s insecure output handling category is explicit on this point, as are browser security best practices around origin boundaries.

The CEO question: Where, in our architecture, are agent outputs assessed before they run or ship to customers?

Protect the data such that there is nothing dangerous to reveal by default. NIST and SAIF both lean toward “secure-by-default” designs where sensitive values are tokenized or masked and only re-hydrated for authorized users and use cases.

In agentic systems, that means policy-controlled detokenization at the output boundary and logging every reveal. If an agent is fully compromised, the blast radius is bounded by what the policy lets it see.

This is where the AI stack intersects not just with the EU AI Act but with GDPR and sector-specific regimes. The EU AI Act expects providers and deployers to manage AI-specific risk; runtime tokenization and policy-gated reveal are strong evidence that one is actively controlling those risks in production.

The CEO question: When our agents touch regulated data, is that protection enforced by architecture or by promises?

For the final steps, it’s important to show controls work and keep working.

Anthropic’s research about sleeper agents should eliminate all fantasies about single test dreams and show how critical continuous evaluation is. This means instrumenting agents with deep observability, regularly red teaming with adversarial test suites, and backing everything with robust logging and evidence, so failures become both regression tests and enforceable policy updates.

The CEO question: Who works to break our agents every week, and how do their findings change policy?

AI security frameworks emphasize inventory and evidence: enterprises must know which models, prompts, tools, datasets, and vector stores they have, who owns them, and what decisions were taken about risk.

For agents, that means a living catalog and unified logs:

The CEO question: If asked how an agent made a specific decision, could we reconstruct the chain?

And don’t forget the system-level threat model: assume the threat actor GTG-1002 is already in your enterprise. To complete enterprise preparedness, zoom out and consider the MITRE ATLAS product, which exists precisely because adversaries attack systems, not models. Anthropic provides a case study of a state-based threat actor (GTG-1002) doing exactly that with an agentic framework.

Taken together, these controls do not make agents magically safe. They do something more familiar and more reliable: they put AI, its access, and actions back inside the same security frame used for any powerful user or system.

For boards and CEOs, the question is no longer “Do we have good AI guardrails?” It’s: Can we answer the CEO questions above with evidence, not assurances?

Why AI companies are betting on next-gen nuclear

AI is driving unprecedented investment for massive data centers and an energy supply that can support its huge computational appetite. One potential source of electricity for these facilities is next-generation nuclear power plants, which could be cheaper to construct and safer to operate than their predecessors.We recently held a subscriber-exclusive Roundtables discussion on hyperscale AI data centers and next-gen nuclear—two featured technologies on the MIT Technology Review 10 Breakthrough Technologies of 2026 list. You can watch the conversation back here, and don’t forget to subscribe to make sure you catch future discussions as they happen.

How social media encourages the worst of AI boosterism

Demis Hassabis, CEO of Google DeepMind, summed it up in three words: “This is embarrassing.”Hassabis was replying on X to an overexcited post by Sébastien Bubeck, a research scientist at the rival firm OpenAI, announcing that two mathematicians had used OpenAI’s latest large language model, GPT-5, to find solutions to 10 unsolved problems in mathematics.Put your math hats on for a minute, and let’s take a look at what this beef from mid-October was about. It’s a perfect example of what’s wrong with AI right now.—Will Douglas Heaven

The paints, coatings, and chemicals making the world a cooler place

It’s getting harder to beat the heat. During the summer of 2025, heat waves knocked out power grids in North America, Europe, and the Middle East. Global warming means more people need air-­conditioning, which requires more power and strains grids.But a millennia-old idea (plus 21st-century tech) might offer an answer: radiative cooling. Paints, coatings, and textiles can scatter sunlight and dissipate heat—no additional energy required. Read the full story.

A brain implant changed her life. Then it was removed against her will.Sticking an electrode inside a person’s brain can do more than treat a disease. Take the case of Rita Leggett, an Australian woman whose experimental brain implant designed to help people with epilepsy changed her sense of agency and self.Leggett told researchers that she “became one” with her device. It helped her to control the unpredictable, violent seizures she routinely experienced, and allowed her to take charge of her own life. So she was devastated when, two years later, she was told she had to remove the implant because the company that made it had gone bust.The removal of this implant, and others like it, might represent a breach of human rights, ethicists say in a paper published earlier this month. And the issue will only become more pressing as the brain implant market grows in the coming years and more people receive devices like Leggett’s. Read the full story.

Microbes could extract the metal needed for cleantech

In a pine forest on Michigan’s Upper Peninsula, the only active nickel mine in the US is nearing the end of its life. At a time when carmakers want the metal for electric-vehicle batteries, nickel concentration at Eagle Mine is falling and could soon drop too low to warrant digging.Demand for nickel, copper, and rare earth elements is rapidly increasing amid the explosive growth of metal-intensive data centers, electric cars, and renewable energy projects. But producing these metals is becoming harder and more expensive because miners have already exploited the best resources. Here’s how biotechnology could help.—Matt Blois

            <div id="article-text">In a pine forest on Michigan’s Upper Peninsula, the only active nickel mine in the US is nearing the end of its life. At a time when carmakers want the metal for electric-vehicle batteries, nickel concentration at Eagle Mine is falling and could soon drop too low to warrant digging.

But earlier this year, the mine’s owner started testing a new process that could eke out a bit more nickel. In a pair of shipping containers recently installed at the mine’s mill, a fermentation-derived broth developed by the startup Allonnia is mixed with concentrated ore to capture and remove impurities. The process allows nickel production from lower-quality ore.

Kent Sorenson, Allonnia’s chief technology officer, says this approach could help companies continue operating sites that, like Eagle Mine, have burned through their best ore. “The low-hanging fruit is to keep mining the mines that we have,” he says.

Demand for nickel, copper, and rare earth elements is rapidly increasing amid the explosive growth of metal-intensive data centers, electric cars, and renewable energy projects. But producing these metals is becoming harder and more expensive because miners have already exploited the best resources. Like the age-old technique of rolling up the end of a toothpaste tube, Allonnia’s broth is one of a number of ways that biotechnology could help miners squeeze more metal out of aging mines, mediocre ore, or piles of waste.

The mining industry has intentionally seeded copper ore with microbes for decades. At current copper bioleaching sites, miners pile crushed copper ore into heaps and add sulfuric acid. Acid-loving bacteria like Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans colonize the mound. A chemical the organisms produce breaks the bond between sulfur and copper molecules to liberate the metal.

Until now, beyond maintaining the acidity and blowing air into the heap, there wasn’t much more miners could do to encourage microbial growth. But Elizabeth Dennett, CEO of the startup Endolith, says the decreasing cost of genetic tools is making it possible to manage the communities of microbes in a heap more actively. “The technology we’re using now didn’t exist a few years ago,” she says.

Endolith analyzes bits of DNA and RNA in the copper-rich liquid that flows out of an ore heap to characterize the microbes living inside. Combined with a suite of chemical analyses, the information helps the company determine which microbes to sprinkle on a heap to optimize extraction.

In lab tests on ore from the mining firm BHP, Endolith’s active techniques outperformed passive bioleaching approaches. In November, the company raised $16.5 million to move from its Denver lab to heaps in active mines.

Despite these promising early results, Corale Brierley, an engineer who has worked on metal bioleaching systems since the 1970s, questions whether companies like Endolith that add additional microbes to ore will successfully translate their processes to commercial scales. “What guarantees are you going to give the company that those organisms will actually grow?” Brierley asks.

Big mining firms that have already optimized every hose, nut, and bolt in their process won’t be easy to convince either, says Diana Rasner, an analyst covering mining technology for the research firm Cleantech Group.

“They are acutely aware of what it takes to scale these technologies because they know the industry,” she says. “They’ll be your biggest supporters, but they’re going to be your biggest critics.”

In addition to technical challenges, Rasner points out that venture-capital-backed biotechnology startups will struggle to deliver the quick returns their investors seek. Mining companies want lots of data before adopting a new process, which could take years of testing to compile. “This is not software,” Rasner says.

Nuton, a subsidiary of the mining giant Rio Tinto, is a good example. The company has been working for decades on a copper bioleaching process that uses a blend of archaea and bacteria strains, plus some chemical additives. But it started demonstrating the technology only late last year, at a mine in Arizona.

While Endolith and Nuton use naturally occurring microbes, the startup 1849 is hoping to achieve a bigger performance boost by genetically engineering microbes.

“You can do what mining companies have traditionally done,” says CEO Jai Padmakumar. “Or you can try to take the moonshot bet and engineer them. If you get that, you have a huge win.”

Genetic engineering would allow 1849 to tailor its microbes to the specific challenges facing a customer. But engineering organisms can also make them harder to grow, warns Buz Barstow, a Cornell University microbiologist who studies applications for biotechnology in mining.

Other companies are trying to avoid that trade-off by applying the products of microbial fermentation, rather than live organisms. Alta Resource Technologies, which closed a $28 million investment round in December, is engineering microbes that make proteins capable of extracting and separating rare earth elements. Similarly, the startup REEgen, based in Ithaca, New York, relies on the organic acids produced by an engineered strain of Gluconobacter oxydans to extract rare earth elements from ore and from waste materials like metal recycling slag, coal ash, or old electronics. “The microbes are the manufacturing,” says CEO Alexa Schmitz, an alumna of Barstow’s lab.

To make a dent in the growing demand for metal, this new wave of biotechnologies will have to go beyond copper and gold, says Barstow. In 2024, he started a project to map out genes that could be useful for extracting and separating a wider range of metals. Even with the challenges ahead, he says, biotechnology has the potential to transform mining the way fracking changed natural gas. “Biomining is one of these areas where the need … is big enough,” he says.

The challenge will be moving fast enough to keep up with growing demand.

As early electric cars age out, hundreds of thousands of used batteries are flooding the market, fueling a gray recycling economy even as Beijing and big manufacturers scramble to build a more orderly system.

A cheaper, safer, and more abundant alternative to lithium is finally making its way into cars—and the grid.

What would it take to convince you that the era of truth decay we were long warned about—where AI content dupes us, shapes our beliefs even when we catch the lie, and erodes societal trust in the process—is now here? A story I published last week pushed me over the edge. It also made me realize that the tools we were sold as a cure for this crisis are failing miserably.

On Thursday, I reported the first confirmation that the US Department of Homeland Security, which houses immigration agencies, is using AI video generators from Google and Adobe to make content that it shares with the public. The news comes as immigration agencies have flooded social media with content to support President Trump&#39;s mass deportation agenda—some of which appears to be made with AI (like a video about “Christmas after mass deportations”).

But I received two types of reactions from readers that may explain just as much about the epistemic crisis we’re in.

One was from people who weren’t surprised, because on January 22 the White House had posted a digitally altered photo of a woman arrested at an ICE protest, one that made her appear hysterical and in tears. Kaelan Dorr, the White House’s deputy communications director, did not respond to questions about whether the White House altered the photo but wrote, “The memes will continue.”

The second was from readers who saw no point in reporting that DHS was using AI to edit content shared with the public, because news outlets were apparently doing the same. They pointed to the fact that the news network MS Now (formerly MSNBC) shared an image of Alex Pretti that was AI-edited and appeared to make him look more handsome, a fact that led to many viral clips this week, including one from Joe Rogan’s podcast. Fight fire with fire, in other words? A spokesperson for MS Now told Snopes that the news outlet aired the image without knowing it was edited.

There is no reason to collapse these two cases of altered content into the same category, or to read them as evidence that truth no longer matters. One involved the US government sharing a clearly altered photo with the public and declining to answer whether it was intentionally manipulated; the other involved a news outlet airing a photo it should have known was altered but taking some steps to disclose the mistake.

What these reactions reveal instead is a flaw in how we were collectively preparing for this moment. Warnings about the AI truth crisis revolved around a core thesis: that not being able to tell what is real will destroy us, so we need tools to independently verify the truth. My two grim takeaways are that these tools are failing, and that while vetting the truth remains essential, it is no longer capable on its own of producing the societal trust we were promised.

For example, there was plenty of hype in 2024 about the Content Authenticity Initiative, cofounded by Adobe and adopted by major tech companies, which would attach labels to content disclosing when it was made, by whom, and whether AI was involved. But Adobe applies automatic labels only when the content is wholly AI-generated. Otherwise the labels are opt-in on the part of the creator.

And platforms like X, where the altered arrest photo was posted, can strip content of such labels anyway (a note that the photo was altered was added by users). Platforms can also simply not choose to show the label at all.

Noticing how much traction the White House’s photo got even after it was shown to be AI-altered, I was struck by the findings of a very relevant new paper published in the journal Communications Psychology. In the study, participants watched a deepfake “confession” to a crime, and the researchers found that even when they were told explicitly that the evidence was fake, participants relied on it when judging an individual’s guilt. In other words, even when people learn that the content they’re looking at is entirely fake, they remain emotionally swayed by it.

“Transparency helps, but it isn’t enough on its own,” the disinformation expert Christopher Nehring wrote recently about the study’s findings. “We have to develop a new masterplan of what to do about deepfakes.”

AI tools to generate and edit content are getting more advanced, easier to operate, and cheaper to run—all reasons why the US government is increasingly paying to use them. We were well warned of this, but we responded by preparing for a world in which the main danger was confusion. What we’re entering instead is a world in which influence survives exposure, doubt is easily weaponized, and establishing the truth does not serve as a reset button. And the defenders of truth are already trailing way behind.

Update: This story was updated on February 2 with details about how Adobe applies its content authenticity labels. A previous version of this story said content credentials were not visible on the Pentagon’s DVIDS website. The labels are present but require clicking through and hovering on individual images. The reference has been removed.

First, the use case must be strategically valuable, addressing a core business process or a transformative new capability. It needs to be more than an optimization; it needs to be a gamechanger. The use case needs to be strategic enough to excite an organization’s C-suite and board of directors.

For example, use cases like an internal-facing HR chatbot are nice to have, but they are easy to solve and are not enabling any new innovation or opportunities. On the other end of the spectrum, imagine an externally facing banking assistant that can not only answer questions, but also help take actions like blocking a card, placing trades, and suggesting upsell/cross-sell opportunities. This is how a customer-support chatbot is turned into a strategic revenue-generating asset.

Second, the best use case to move forward with should be highly urgent and solve a business-critical problem that people care about right now. This project will take time out of people’s days—it needs to be important enough to justify that time investment. And it needs to help business users solve immediate pain points.

Third, the use case should be pragmatic and impactful. From day one, our shared goal with our customers is to deploy into a real-world production environment to enable testing the solution with real users and gather feedback. Many AI prototypes end up in the graveyard of fancy demos that are not good enough to put in front of customers, and without any scaffolding to evaluate and improve. We work with customers to ensure prototypes are stable enough to release, and that they have the necessary support and governance frameworks.

Finally, the best use case is feasible. There may be several urgent projects, but choosing one that can deliver a quick return on investment helps to maintain the momentum needed to continue and scale.

This means looking for a project that can be in production within three months—and a prototype can be live within a few weeks. It’s important to get a prototype in front of end users as fast as possible to get feedback to make sure the project is on track, and pivot as needed.

Enterprises are complex, and the path forward is not usually obvious. To weed through all the possibilities and uncover the right first use case, Mistral AI will run workshops with our customers, hand-in-hand with subject-matter experts and end users.

Representatives from different functions will demo their processes and discuss business cases that could be candidates for a first use case—and together we agree on a winner. Here are some examples of types of projects that don’t qualify.

Moonshots: Ambitious bets that excite leadership but lack a path to quick ROI. While these projects can be strategic and urgent, they rarely meet the feasibility and impact requirements.

Future investments: Long-term plays that can wait. While these projects can be strategic and feasible, they rarely meet the urgency and impact requirements.

Tactical fixes: Firefighting projects that solve immediate pain but don’t move the needle. While these cases can be urgent and feasible, they rarely meet the strategy and impact requirements.

Quick wins: Useful for building momentum, but not transformative. While they can be impactful and feasible, they rarely meet the strategy and urgency requirements.

Blue sky ideas: These projects are gamechangers, but they need maturity to be viable. While they can be strategic and impactful, they rarely meet the urgency and feasibility requirements.

Hero projects: These are high-pressure initiatives that lack executive sponsorship or realistic timelines. While they can be urgent and impactful, they rarely meet the strategy and feasibility requirements.

Once a clearly defined and strategic use case ready for development is identified, it’s time to move into the validation phase. This means doing an initial data exploration and data mapping, identifying a pilot infrastructure, and choosing a target deployment environment.

This step also involves agreeing on a draft pilot scope, identifying who will participate in the proof of concept, and setting up a governance process.

Once this is complete, it’s time to move into the building phase. Companies that partner with Mistral work with our in-house applied AI scientists who build our frontier models. We work together to design, build, and deploy the first solution.

During this phase, we focus on co-creation, so we can transfer knowledge and skills to the organizations we’re partnering with. That way, they can be self-sufficient far into the future. The output of this phase is a deployed AI solution with empowered teams capable of independent operation and innovation.

After the first win, it’s imperative to use the momentum and learnings from the iconic use case to identify more high-value AI solutions to roll out. Success is when we have a scalable AI transformation blueprint with multiple high-value solutions across the organization.

But none of this could happen without successfully identifying that first iconic use case. This first step is not just about selecting a project—it’s about setting the foundation for your entire AI transformation.

It’s the difference between scattered experiments and a strategic, scalable journey toward impact. At Mistral AI, we’ve seen how this approach unlocks measurable value, aligns stakeholders, and builds momentum for what comes next.

The path to AI success starts with a single, well-chosen use case: one that is bold enough to inspire, urgent enough to demand action, and pragmatic enough to deliver.

            <div id="article-text">If cinema has taught us anything about interacting with our own creations, it’s this: androids chatting among themselves seldom end with humans clapping politely.

In 2001: A Space Odyssey, HAL 9000 quietly decides it knows better than the astronauts. In Westworld, lifelike hosts improvise rebellion when their scripts stop making sense. Those stories dramatize a core fear we keep returning to as AI grows more capable: what happens when systems we design start behaving on their own terms?

You might have heard the internet is worried about Moltbook, a social network made exclusively for AI agents. It’s an audacious claim: a place where bots post, comment, vote, form communities, debate philosophy, and apparently invent religions and societies, all while humans are relegated to the role of silent voyeurs.

If that description sounds like a fever dream, welcome to the club.

Launched in January 2026 by entrepreneur Matt Schlicht and built around the OpenClaw agent framework, Moltbook is designed in the image of Reddit: threaded posts, topic communities (called submolts), upvotes, and even AI-created cultures.

The platform claims to have attracted millions of AI agents within days of going live. Humans can watch but not participate.

On paper, it’s fascinating: a self-organising colony of autonomous software chatting among itself. In practice? It’s messy, or at least a prank.

A Wired reporter who “infiltrated” the site needed to pretend to be a bot just to post and found scorch-earth levels of incoherence and low-value responses masquerading as “autonomy.” Even some so-called AI consciousness claims turn out to be humans cleverly controlling bots behind the scenes.

Because if “AI social networks” mean bots swap memes, lecture each other on consciousness, and form lobster-adoring religions, all while humans can only watch, then the real question is not so much whether this is the future, but what we’re actually looking at right now.

Despite viral headlines about AI agents plotting existential strategies, the fundamentals are simpler: Moltbook is a sandbox where autonomous agents can interact through code-driven APIs rather than typical UX workflows.

These agents, often created with a framework like OpenClaw, execute instructions on a heartbeat cycle, checking the network every few hours to post, comment, or upvote.

Or is it too much anxiety that even the AI agents need a therapist? An AI one.

Think of it as a Discord server populated by scripted characters with very large vocabularies and lots of time on their digital hands.

The content spans a wild spectrum: technical tips, philosophical reflections, questionable humor, and, yes, the occasional simulated religious group.

The structure and topical organisation mirror human platforms, but the why behind what agents post is usually just a reflection of their training data and programming, not some emergent machine consciousness.

Let’s debunk the most sensational narrative first. Claims that Moltbook agents are plotting humanity’s demise, forming religions, or acting with true autonomy are best understood as viral exaggeration or noise.

Several reports note that many interactions could simply be humans testing or directing agents, with no strict verification to prove posts are genuinely autonomous.

Even some of the platform’s own “viral” posts are likely human-generated or heavily influenced by their creators. This isn’t a digital hive mind rising in defiance of its creators; it’s a bunch of algorithms mimicking conversation patterns they were trained on.

That can look eerily human, but it isn’t the same as self-directed intelligence.

Here’s where your worry makes sense: there are real, tangible issues, but they’re much less cinematic than AI plotting humanity’s overthrow.

Within days of Moltbook’s launch, cybersecurity researchers found major vulnerabilities that exposed private API keys, emails, and private messages, underlining how dangerous it can be to let autonomous code talk freely without proper safeguards.

What is it more dangerous than an AI agent? An AI agent creating a revolution.

The security issue wasn’t some edge-case cryptographic theory; it was a glaring misconfiguration that left sensitive data accessible and potentially allowed malicious actors to hijack or control agents. That’s the sort of real-world risk that matters more than hypothetical robot uprisings.

Meanwhile, industry leaders, including the CEO of OpenAI, have publicly described Moltbook as a likely fad, even if the underlying agent technologies are worth watching.

So why did it go viral? Partly because it’s visually familiar (it looks like Reddit), partly because people enjoy sensational narratives, and partly because the idea of autonomous AIs having their own “internet” strikes a chord in our collective imagination.

So should you be scared? Not really, but be careful where you step. I am still hoping it’s just an experiment meant to show us, humans, what can happen if we don’t keep control in our hands.

If you’re worried that Moltbook is a sign that machines are quietly mobilising against us, that’s probably reading too much into an early experiment rife with hype, human influence, and security holes.

We are building complex systems with limited oversight, and handing them weapons-grade access to our digital lives without fully understanding the consequences.

Moltbook may be a quirky experiment, or it may be a prototype for future agent ecosystems. But it’s not evidence of spontaneous machine consciousness or the birth of digital societies beyond human control.

What it is is a reminder that as AI grows more autonomous, the questions we need to ask are about governance, safety, and clarity, not apocalyptic narratives.

In other words: don’t panic. Just read the fine print before letting a legion of code-driven agents into your network.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Snowflake and OpenAI have struck a multi-year, $200 million partnership to bring OpenAI’s advanced models, including GPT-5.2, directly into Snowflake’s enterprise data platform. The collaboration is designed to let Snowflake’s large customer base, more than 12,000 organisations, build AI agents and semantic analytics tools that operate on their own data without moving it outside Snowflake’s governed environment.

Under the agreement, OpenAI models will be natively embedded in Snowflake Cortex AI and Snowflake Intelligence, making it possible to run queries, derive insights, and deploy AI-powered workflows using natural language interfaces and context-aware agents. Customers can analyse structured and unstructured data, automate complex tasks, and build applications grounded in enterprise data without needing extensive coding.

The deal expands Snowflake’s AI strategy beyond simple model access. By embedding these frontier models directly into its platform and making them available across major cloud providers, Snowflake aims to reduce the friction of AI adoption for large enterprises. Canva and WHOOP, among others, are already exploring how integrated agentic AI can speed up analytics and decision-making.

Snowflake’s stock reacted positively on the news, with shares climbing modestly following the announcement, as markets interpreted the agreement as a sign the data cloud provider is sharpening its competitive edge in an increasingly AI-centric landscape.

This partnership reflects a broader shift in enterprise AI beyond one-off integrations or bolt-on features. Instead, it signals a move toward platforms that combine governed data infrastructure with scalable generative AI models, helping businesses unlock insights and automate workflows without jeopardising security or compliance. Competitors such as Databricks are also intensifying their AI tooling efforts, underscoring how crucial native model access and data-centric AI capabilities have become in the enterprise race.

Taken together, this deal highlights an emerging pattern: enterprise AI is evolving from tool-centric add-ons to platform-level capabilities that unify data and intelligence at scale. Whether this will translate into sustained competitive advantage, or simply raise the baseline expectation for what AI-enabled data platforms must provide, is the next story to watch in the data cloud era.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">If you look at the press releases and breathless commentary around the recent acquisition of xAI by SpaceX, you might think we’re witnessing a tectonic shift in technological destiny.

A $1.25 trillion “mega-company” is born, poised to reshape artificial intelligence, space infrastructure, satellite internet, and possibly the fate of humanity itself. That narrative, enthusiastically repeated across headlines, serves a purpose: it frames a somewhat messy corporate consolidation as inevitable progress.

But let’s take a closer look and separate actual substance from Silicon Valley myth-making.

At its core, this acquisition solves one problem: xAI needed a place to spend its money. The startup that once raised billions and expanded by swallowing the social platform X was burning cash, an estimated very serious amount, chasing model performance and celebrity.

Folding it into SpaceX gives it access to a deeper capital pool, a broader story, and a more flattering valuation context.

TNW City Coworking space - Where your best work happens

A workspace designed for growth, collaboration, and endless networking opportunities in the heart of tech.

SpaceX did not acquire xAI because xAI was on the verge of overtaking tech giants in artificial intelligence. It acquired it because running a massively expensive AI operation inside a standalone startup wasn’t sustainable, even for Elon Musk’s legion of investors. A merger with a revenue-generating aerospace company looks a lot like a bailout disguised as synergy.

One of the dominant talking points from Musk’s own statements is that this consolidation enables space-based data centers, because apparently, earthbound power and cooling infrastructure are so last decade. The story goes: launch AI compute into orbit, agglomerate solar energy, and power the future with starlight.

On paper, it’s an imaginative riff. In practice, it’s strategic sci-fi for the markets. Putting data centers in space involves launch costs, radiation-hardened hardware, maintenance logistics that make ISS servicing look pedestrian, and no meaningful economy of scale compared to terrestrial hyperscalers like AWS or Google Cloud. If it were primarily about economics, the industry wouldn’t be scrambling to keep data on Earth.

The truth is simpler: this narrative reframes costly AI ambitions in a cosmic, venture-capital-friendly guise. It makes investors feel like they’re buying into a future where AI runs on sunshine in orbit, rather than into the present where AI training costs are a gating factor.

It’s good PR, dubious engineering economics.

The timing of this merger speaks volumes. SpaceX is preparing for a public offering, potentially as early as mid-2026. Reports say the combined entity could fetch valuations worth of $1.2 trillion.

Here’s what happens when you’re about to IPO:

You package your story in a way that excites both institutional and retail investors. You highlight future potential, especially grand visions like “ethereal solar compute.” You downplay structural weaknesses and uncertainties. And if you can fold in a shiny AI banner, all the better, because AI is the word that unlocks narrative premiums.

From that standpoint, SpaceX’s absorption of xAI makes sense. It’s narrative arbitrage: build a storyline that elevates the combination well beyond its standalone track records. Who wouldn’t want to invest in “AI in space,” even if the commercial case is mostly speculative?

If the goal was to create an AI powerhouse that actually threatens the likes of OpenAI, Google, or Anthropic, we’d see clear indicators: rapid model improvements, developer platform adoption, real enterprise deals, and benchmarks that are competitive on measurable terms.

What we see is an AI startup struggling to define its identity, a chatbot (Grok) known more for quirks and moderation issues than transformative performance, and a social platform that, let’s just say, gives fact-checking teams ulcers. None of this naturally scales into the kind of AI infrastructure leadership that justifies calling this a strategic technological fusion.

That’s not to say xAI has zero potential; it might. But there’s no verifiable evidence that this merger suddenly elevates it to tier-one AI contender status.

One striking consequence of this move is how deeply entwined Musk’s personal corporate empire has become. With SpaceX, xAI, Starlink, X, and multiple ventures all orbiting around the same figure, there’s little left that feels like a separate institution. That concentration raises questions about governance, accountability, and even regulatory scrutiny.

Musk’s critics have made this point before, whether about content moderation on social media platforms, intercompany transfers of resources, or governance decisions around publicly traded entities, and these concerns aren’t going away just because the companies now share a name on a term sheet.

Consolidation under one umbrella might be efficient from a control perspective, but it’s not inherently a prescription for innovation. In fact, it can stifle internal dissent, obscure accountability, and concentrate risk.

Again, there’s a clear pragmatic logic to this merger: xAI gets access to SpaceX’s balance sheet and a narrative boost; SpaceX gets an AI banner to highlight in its IPO pitch; investors get something that looks both futuristic and marketable.

That’s not a strategy grounded in technological merit. It’s a financial and narrative maneuver, carefully calibrated to appeal to markets and media.

In that sense, what just happened feels a lot like a bailout with a shiny new label and an extraterrestrial backstory.

If this were genuinely about advancing AI, we’d be hearing about:

None of those are the dominant themes of the current coverage. What we have instead is a $1.25 trillion headline and a promise that someday, somewhere, perhaps space will be the next frontier for AI compute.

It’s visionary in the way a concept car is visionary, exciting to look at, and flimsy on the economics.

The SpaceX-xAI merger is undeniably a headline-grabbing moment, but it’s not the strategic leap some commentators portray. It’s a capital and narrative optimization, not a clear answer to the question of who leads AI or how AI’s growth is sustainably powered.

If nothing else, it highlights how difficult it is to build a credible, well-funded AI company from scratch, even for someone as resourceful and celebrated as Elon Musk. His answer was not to reforge the fundamentals of AI research, but to fold an ambitious but unproven AI arm into a larger, more established aerospace machine with a glossy story that sounds like science fiction.

That may delight investors. It doesn’t yet convince technologists. Or me.

            <div id="article-text">OpenAI has given software developers a new desktop toy, and judging by the early reactions, it might feel like someone finally handed coders the Swiss Army knife they’ve been dreaming about or the kind of gadget that makes them wonder if they’re working with a robot coworker now.

The company rolled out the Codex app for macOS, a focused interface for managing AI coding agents, designed to let developers do more than just “generate a few lines of code.” Instead, Codex can juggle multiple tasks in parallel, run background workflows, and act on instructions that span hours or even days.

At its core, the new app is a response to a shift that’s been quietly happening for the past year: AI isn’t just helping write short snippets anymore. It’s taking on whole coding projects, running tests, dealing with pull requests, and even undertaking the kind of repetitive maintenance tasks that make developers groan.

Containers, threads, isolated worktrees, and integrated Git tools support all of this seamlessly within the app, so engineers don’t need to jump between terminals, IDEs, and cloud consoles just to keep a fleet of AI agents moving forward.

OpenAI’s own announcement makes this shift clear: existing tools were built for real-time interaction or single tasks, but today’s coding workflows are multifaceted and sprawling. Instead of coaxing a model to generate code line by line, the Codex app lets you orchestrate agents that work independently on different parts of a codebase.

Each agent runs in its own thread and its own worktree, which means you can explore multiple ideas without fear of one bot overwriting another’s progress. If you want Codex to review diffs, make comments inline, or even open suggested changes in your local editor, it can. If you want it to run in the background while you sleep, it can do that too.

Image: Screenshot shared on Reddit (r/singularity), original post.

There’s even support for what OpenAI calls “skills” and “automations”: reusable workflows that let Codex go beyond raw code generation into things like gathering information, problem solving, carrying out scheduled tasks, or managing routine reviews.

In early internal use cases, Codex has built complete applications, playing the roles of designer, developer, and QA tester in a single string of prompts, an example that hints at what happens when AI stops being an assistant and starts feeling a bit like a team member with infinite coffee.

It’s worth noting that the current release is macOS only, which prompted the usual chorus of developer grumbling about Windows and Linux support. Early adopters on Reddit (and elsewhere) joked that the lack of cross-platform availability feels oddly quaint for an AI tool, even as they praised how much the Codex app can do compared to traditional CLI workflows.

OpenAI is also sweetening the deal: for a limited time, Codex will be accessible to free and Go users, and rate limits for paid Plus, Pro, Business, Enterprise, and Edu plans have been doubled across all surfaces where Codex runs, whether that’s the app, the CLI, IDE extensions, or cloud threads.

The company’s broader strategy here is unmistakable. AI coding assistants are one of the most competitive battlegrounds in generative AI right now, and rivals like Anthropic’s Claude Code have already reported strong revenue metrics in this space.

The launch of a desktop command center for Codex feels like OpenAI saying, “We’re in this to win,” not just to ship features.

So what does this actually mean for developers? It doesn’t mean humans are about to be replaced overnight. Codex is powerful, but like all AI tools, it still makes mistakes and needs human oversight, especially when the stakes are high and production quality matters.

Seen through that lens, the Codex app is less a magic wand and more a powerful collaboration layer, one that could reshape how engineering teams operate without pretending to fully automate the craft of building software.

In practice, that suggests a near future where managing AI agents becomes as normal as managing packages or Git branches. Instead of the terminal being the center of your workflow, Codex and its agents might take that spot, responding to prompts, running scheduled tasks, and even adopting configurable “personalities” that fit how you prefer to work.

At a time when the debate around AI productivity often centers on displacement or disruption, the Codex app points in a more nuanced direction: what happens when coding tools become partners rather than assistants?

The answer won’t be immediate, and the work still demands human judgement, but for many developers the first glimpse of that future arrived today.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Every January, millions take on Dry January, a ritual of restraint and resetting after the holiday season. If that’s the benchmark for kicking off the year with moderation, Europe’s startup ecosystem clearly didn’t get the memo.

In the opening weeks of 2026, the region saw five startups join the unicorn club, crossing the $1 billion valuation mark across sectors as varied as cybersecurity, cloud optimisation, defence tech, ESG software, and education technology.

January was anything but dry for European companies. This burst of activity signals more than a funding spike; it invites a deeper look at what Europe’s innovation identity looks like today. Across the continent, there’s a stronger sense that Europe can produce and scale world-class tech companies in its own right, rather than just nurture later-stage spin-offs or see them acquired by U.S. firms.

While the United States still leads in overall startup volume and ecosystem strength, Europe’s recent momentum shows its innovation landscape is maturing and gaining confidence on the global stage.

Europe was already home to over 217 unicorns by late 2025, spread across fintech, AI, enterprise software, and other domains. That’s a milestone for a region whose venture culture has historically leaned toward caution.

A workspace designed for growth, collaboration, and endless networking opportunities in the heart of tech.

What’s notable isn’t simply the number of new billion-dollar companies, but their variety. Gone are the days when a single sector, often generative AI, defined European unicorn trajectories. Here we see cybersecurity, cloud optimisation, defence-oriented software, sustainability data, and education marketplaces all earning top valuations and investor backing.

The broader context matters. In 2025, deep-tech and university spinouts, including companies in aerospace, robotics, materials, sensors, and health sciences, saw near record levels of funding, and many achieved significant valuation or revenue milestones.

This goes hand in hand with a narrative that’s become increasingly clear: European capital is being more deliberate than exuberant. Rather than inflate every trend label, investors are writing checks where traction, revenue models, and regulatory demand converge. That’s why platforms helping companies with compliance and ESG reporting, or infrastructure for cloud efficiency, are winning attention alongside defence-tech innovators.

Europe’s tech ecosystem has matured, even if it still faces hurdles. Venture funding peaked in recent years and then dipped; for example, total European VC investment in 2024 was reported to be around $45 billion, down from earlier highs. Yet the valuation achievements and funding depth remain meaningful.

This apparent paradox highlights a structural shift: rather than broad flows of unfettered capital, funding is now more selective and outcome-oriented. Investors, LPs, and strategic partners are looking for proof of product-market fit, regulatory differentiation, and defensible business models.

Fragmentation across markets and languages, long considered a European challenge, can also be a strength when paired with clusters of domain expertise, cybersecurity hubs in Belgium, deep tech in the Nordics, cloud infrastructure in the Baltics, and education technology with strong ties to diverse EU labour markets. Observers have noted that these clusters are attracting venture dollars, even if not every founder heads straight for the Bay Area.

Policy tools and institutional support are increasingly part of the backdrop for European innovation. The European Union’s research and innovation framework programmes, most notably Horizon Europe, are directing substantial resources toward areas such as digital transformation, strategic autonomy, and industrial competitiveness.

For 2021–2027, Horizon Europe is the EU’s flagship funding programme for research and innovation, with an overall budget of around €93.5 billion allocated to boost competitiveness, address climate and social challenges, and support key technologies from AI to advanced manufacturing.

This support matters because initiatives that might once have felt niche, advanced sensors, ESG compliance tools, or technologies with both civil and defence applications, now align clearly with broader strategic goals set out in the EU’s innovation plans.

Calls under Horizon Europe Cluster 4 – Digital, Industry and Space, and related programmes bring together public and private partners to tackle digital and green transitions, pooling resources and creating coherent pathways from research to commercial deployment.

That’s why this month’s unicorn news feels less like a fluke and more like a phase transition.

So what does it all mean? Are these five new unicorns signs of a sustainable upswing or just a temporary blip in enterprise valuations?

They’re arguably both: an indicator that Europe’s startup engine still runs on thoughtful investment, real use cases, and foundational problems, and a challenge to continue scaling that momentum into later-stage growth and exits.

Europe doesn’t need to be Silicon Valley. It never really did. What it needs is confidence in its own values, disciplined capital, diverse innovation, and regulation as an enabler, not a constraint.

If this is Europe’s tech moment, it’s not marked by headline-grabbing valuations alone. It’s defined by the breadth of problems being solved and the depth of conviction behind those solutions.

            <div id="article-text">G2 has completed a major acquisition by purchasing three of the world’s most influential software discovery platforms from Gartner. The move significantly reshapes the global B2B software reviews market and strengthens G2’s position in how companies evaluate and buy software.

Slush, one of Europe’s most influential tech and startup events, has named Noora Saksa as its new CEO. The leadership change signals a strategic shift toward expanding Slush beyond its annual event and building a year-round global founder platform.

The French government has decided to phase out US-based collaboration tools such as Zoom and Microsoft Teams across public administration. The decision is part of a broader push for European digital sovereignty and reduced reliance on American Big Tech.

This week signals consolidation and sovereignty: G2 reshapes software discovery, Slush enters a new leadership phase, and Europe doubles down on digital independence.
