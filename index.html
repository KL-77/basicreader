            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">When a new presidential administration comes in, it is responsible for filling around 4,000 jobs sprinkled across the federal government’s vast bureaucracy. These political appointees help carry out the president’s agenda, and, at least in theory, make government agencies responsive to elected officials.

Some of these roles—the secretary of state, for example—are well-known. Others, such as the deputy assistant secretary for textiles, consumer goods, materials, critical minerals & metals industry & analysis, are more obscure.

Historically, science agencies like NASA or the National Institutes of Health tend to have fewer political appointees than many other parts of the federal government. Sometimes, very senior roles—with authority over billions of dollars of spending, and the power to shape entire fields of research—are filled without any direct input from the White House or Congress. The arrangement reflects a long-running argument that scientists should oversee the work of funding and conducting research with very little interference from political leaders.

Since the early 2000s, according to federal employment records, NIH, the country’s premier biomedical research agency, has usually had just a few political appointees within its workforce. (As of November 2025, that workforce numbered around 17,500 people, after significant cuts.) Staff scientists and external experts played a key role in selecting the directors of the 27 institutes and centers that make up NIH. That left the selection of people for powerful positions largely outside of direct White House oversight.

What is the future of that status quo under the Trump administration?

Those questions have recently swirled at NIH. The arrival of political appointees in the kinds of positions previously held by civil servants, and apparent changes to hiring practices for other key positions, have raised concerns among current and former officials about a new era of politicization.

For decades, NIH has enjoyed strong bipartisan support. But conservative lawmakers have periodically raised questions about some of the agency’s spending, and according to one 2014 survey, the agency is perceived by federal executives as being a progressive place. (Since the early 2000s, some data suggests, US scientists as a whole have grown considerably more liberal relative to the general population.)

Since the COVID-19 pandemic, many conservatives have criticized NIH for funding the kind of controversial virology experiments that some experts believe may have started the pandemic, and for promoting public health strategies that many on the right viewed as unscientific and authoritarian. One of the NIH institute directors, Anthony Fauci, who led the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases from 1984 until his retirement in 2022, came to be a highly polarizing figure, described on the right as an unelected official wielding considerable power.

Over the years, some biomedical researchers have argued for changes to the way NIH hires and retains people in leadership positions. In 2019, the agency announced plans to impose term limits on some midlevel roles, in a bid to diversify its management. More recently, Johns Hopkins University physician and researcher Joseph Marine argued in an essay for The Free Press that NIH should set five to 10-year term limits on the directors of individual NIH institutes. “Regular turnover of leadership,” he wrote, “brings fresh ideas and a healthy reassessment of priorities.”

Shortly after winning the 2024 presidential election, Donald Trump tapped Jay Bhattacharya, a prominent critic of NIH, to lead the agency. It may not be entirely surprising that an administration advocating for reforms to NIH would seek to flip key management positions that often experience little turnover.

Former official Mike Lauer, who until early 2025 oversaw NIH’s vast external grants program, said there were signs before Trump’s second inauguration that institute directors might be subject to fresh political scrutiny.

“There was a frustration that so much of the agency’s direction, as well as financial decision-making, was being made by people who are outside of the political sphere,” Lauer told Undark. He pointed to a line in Project 2025, a proposed roadmap for the Trump administration that was produced by the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank. “Funding for scientific research,” the report argues, “should not be controlled by a small group of highly paid and unaccountable insiders at the NIH, many of whom stay in power for decades.”

Soon after Trump’s inauguration, some senior officials at NIH were put on administrative leave or abruptly departed, including Lawrence Tabak, who had spent more than a decade as principal deputy director and served as NIH’s interim leader for almost two years during the COVID-19 pandemic.

At the same time, the administration grew the number of political appointees at NIH. As of late June, according to federal records, the Trump administration had placed nine political appointees at the agency, up from four the year before—itself higher than in most previous years. One of them, Seana Cranston, is a former Republican Congressional staffer who serves as chief of staff to the NIH Director; her predecessor was a career civil servant who had spent nearly 40 years in the NIH, the last four as chief of staff. Another is Michael Allen, who took the role of chief operating officer for the $6.5 billion NIAID, Fauci’s former institute. (Allen was appointed with no official announcement, and appears to have no official biography or background information posted on NIH websites.)

Those numbers still left NIH with fewer political appointees than many other agencies, including NASA, a comparably sized science agency.

The administration has departed from the traditional process for hiring NIH’s 27 institute and center directors, who are responsible for overseeing most of the funding decisions and day-to-day operations of NIH.

In the spring of 2025, five of those directors—including the head of NIAID—were fired or placed on administrative leave. (They have all since been removed from their positions.)

Then, in September, part of the search committee for the National Institute of Mental Health was abruptly disbanded, and then just as suddenly reconvened, according to Joshua Gordon, the former head of that institute, and one other source close to NIH.

In October, the directorship of another agency, the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, was filled by a close personal friend of Vice President JD Vance, without any apparent search process — a move that multiple former NIH officials told Undark may be unprecedented.

By then, 13 other NIH institutes and centers had vacant leadership posts. Other roles have opened up more recently: In an email to NIH staff on Dec. 30, Bhattacharya announced the departure of Walter Koroshetz, leader of the agency’s main neuroscience research institute. In the email, Bhattacharya seemed to suggest he had opposed the decision: “Dr. Koroshetz’s performance as Director has been exceptional,” Bhattacharya wrote, but “the Department of Health and Human Services has elected to pursue a leadership transition.”

In early January, the Director of the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute announced his retirement, bringing the total number of open posts to 15.

The searches, NIH insiders say, appear to be happening on a compressed timeline. And while the NIH director has typically relied on search committees consisting of both NIH career scientists and external experts, multiple sources close to NIH say the agency has not formed those kinds of committees to make the latest round of hires.

In response to questions from Undark in early January, the Department of Health and Human Services sent a brief emailed statement, signed “NIH Press Team,” explaining that “an NIH leadership team with experience in scientific agency management will consider the applicant pool and make recommendations to the NIH Director.” The press representative declined to respond to follow-up questions about who would be on that team, or why the hiring process had changed.

Those changes have prompted speculation among some NIH insiders that the Trump administration is seeking to exert more political control over the hiring of directorships.

“Having external members on the search committee is vitally important for preventing politicization,” said Mark Histed, an NIH scientist who has recently been a critic — on his personal time, he stresses — of Trump’s approach to the agency. “Because, as you can imagine, if you’ve got a bunch of external scientists, it’s a lot harder to ram down what the White House wants, because people are not part of the political system.”

That kind of open and non-politicized search process, Histed said in a follow-up interview, isn’t unique to NIH: It’s one widely used by scientific institutions around the world. And it has worked, he argued, to help make NIH a scientific juggernaut: “That process,” he said, “led to 80 years of staggering scientific success.”

Members of Congress have taken notice. In language attached to the current appropriations bill moving through Congress, lawmakers direct NIH “to maintain its longstanding practice of including external scientists and stakeholders” in the search process. (Agencies are supposed to follow these Congressional instructions, but they are not binding.) In late January, Diana DeGette, a Democratic representative from Colorado, sponsored a bill that, according to a press release, would “Protect NIH From Political Interference” by, among other steps, capping the number of political appointees at the agency.

Lauer, the former NIH grants chief, took a broader historical view of the changes. There has long been a tug-of-war, he said, between presidential administrations that seek more political control over an agency, and civil servants and other bureaucratic experts who may resist that perceived incursion. From the point of view of politicians and their staff, Lauer said, “what they’ll say—I understand where they’re coming from—what they’ll say is, is that more political control means that the agency is going to be responsive to the will of the electorate, that there’s a greater degree of transparency and public accountability.”

Those upsides can be significant, Lauer said, but there are also downsides, including more short-term thinking, unstable budgets, and the potential loss of expertise and competence.

Mark Richardson, a political scientist at Georgetown University, is an expert on politicization and the federal bureaucracy. In his work, he said, he has observed a correlation between how much political parties disagree over the role of a specific agency, and the degree to which presidential administrations seek to exert control there through appointees and other personnel choices. NIH has historically fallen alongside agencies like the Bureau of Labor Statistics and the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office that are subject to broad alignment across the parties.

“I think what you’re seeing more with the Trump administration is kind of an expansion of political conflict to these types of agencies,” Richardson said.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Exterminators keep getting calls for a reason. Wood-devouring insects, such as beetles, termites, and carpenter ants, are constantly chewing through walls or infecting trees and breaking them down. The fight against these insects usually involved noxious insecticides; but now, at least some of them can be eliminated using a certain species of fungus.

Infestations of bark beetles are the bane of spruce trees. Eurasian spruce bark beetles (Ips typographus) ingest bark high in phenolic compounds, organic molecules that often act as antioxidants and antimicrobials. They protect spruce bark from pathogenic fungi—and the beetles take advantage. Their bodies boost the antimicrobial power of these compounds by turning them into substances that are even more toxic to fungi. This would seem to make the beetles invulnerable to fungi.

There is a way to get past the beetles’ borrowed defenses, though. Led by biochemist Ruo Sun, a team of researchers from the Max Planck Institute for Chemical Ecology in Jena, Germany, found that some strains of the fungus Beauveria bassiana are capable of infecting and killing the pests.

“Insect herbivores have long been known to accumulate plant defense metabolites from their diet as defenses against their own enemies,” she said in a study recently published in PNAS. “However, as shown here for B. bassiana, fungal pathogens are able to circumvent the toxicity of these dietary defenses and cause disease.”

Populations of bark beetles have recently exploded in temperate forests because of climate change. One species they feed on is the Norway spruce (Picea abies), which makes organic phenolic compounds known as stilbenes and flavonoids. Stilbenes are hydrocarbons that function as secondary metabolites for plants, and flavonoids, which are polyphenols, are also secondary plant metabolites that are often antioxidants. The spruce links both classes of compounds with sugars and relies on their antibacterial and antifungal activity.

When metabolized by the beetles, the spruce sugars are removed through hydrolysis, converting them into aglycones that are even more toxic to microscopic invaders. Despite that, some fungi appear to be able to deactivate these compounds. Strains of the fungal insect pathogen B. bassiana have been documented as killing some of these beetles in the wild.

Sun wanted to put this fungus to the test. While not all strains have been effective at eliminating bark beetles, she and her team extracted the fungus from beetles that had succumbed to it. They bred these strains in their lab to see how effective they would be against the insects. They identified the genes that gave these fungi their ability to metabolize phenolic compounds ingested by the beetles and detoxify them so they were no longer protective. They then experimented with knocking out these genes to see whether the mutant fungi would still be able to take down beetles.

Once beetles were infected with B. bassiana, the researchers found the fungus detoxifies protective compounds in two phases. The aglycones that were made so potent by the removal of sugars from spruce stilbenes and flavanoids are made weaker by having the sugar restored in the first phase. Methylation happens next. After this phase, the sugar is linked to a methyl group (CH3), forming a type of methylglucoside. This particular methylglucoside is harmless to the fungus. Mutant strains of the fungus that had their detoxification genes knocked out could not produce methylglucoside, so they were not as effective at infecting beetles and were nowhere near as lethal.

B. bassiana is not the only fungus that is capable of this detox. Other species, including the infamous Cordyceps militaris that terrorized a dystopian society in The Last of Us (though it will not turn people into fungus monsters), are capable of producing methylglucosides from stilbenes, flavonoids, and other compounds that are supposed to protect plants from infection and are borrowed by the insects that gorge on them.

“Besides direct detoxification, fungi such as B. bassiana could have other mechanisms of resisting plant defense compounds,” Sun said. “[Some] are known to excrete compounds like resveratrol from fungal cells, and so could also play a role in increasing fungal growth and virulence on substrates containing toxic compounds.”

Fungi could be weaponized as pest control in the future. The researchers think it is possible that the genes that enable B. bassiana to detoxify antifungal substances could enable it to metabolize other defensive plant substances ingested by harmful insects. Instead of sprayers full of dangerous chemicals, exterminators may soon arrive with petri dishes instead.</div>

            <div id="article-text">It’s a regrettable reality that there is never enough time to cover all the interesting scientific stories we come across each month. So every month, we highlight a handful of the best stories that nearly slipped through the cracks. January’s list includes a lip-syncing robot; using brewer’s yeast as scaffolding for lab-grown meat;  hunting for Leonardo da Vinci’s DNA in his art; and new evidence that humans really did transport the stones to build Stonehenge from Wales and northern Scotland, rather than being transported by glaciers.

Stonehenge is an iconic landmark of endless fascination to tourists and researchers alike. There has been a lot of recent chemical analysis identifying where all the stones that make up the structure came from, revealing that many originated in quarries a significant distance away. So how were the stones transported to their current location?

One theory holds that glaciers moved the bluestones at least part of the way from Wales to Salisbury Plain in southern England, while others contend that humans moved them—although precisely how that was done has yet to be conclusively determined. Researchers at Curtin University have now produced the strongest scientific evidence to date that it was humans, not glaciers, that transported the stones, according to a paper published in the journal Communications Earth & Environment.

Curtin’s Anthony Clarke and co-authors relied on mineral fingerprinting to arrive at their conclusions. In 2024, Clarke’s team discovered the Stonehenge Altar Stone originated from the Orkney region in the very northeast corner of Scotland, rather than Wales. This time, they analyzed hundreds of zircon crystals collected from rivers close to the historic monument, looking for evidence of Pleistocene-era sediment. Per Clarke, if the stones had “sailed” to the plain from further north, there would be a distinct mineral signature in that sediment as the transported rocks eroded over time. They didn’t find that signature, making it far more likely that humans transported the stone.

Everyone knows grasshoppers can hop, but they can also flap their wings, jump, and glide, moving seamlessly across both the ground and through the air. That ability inspired scientists from Princeton University to devise a novel approach to building robotic wings, according to a paper published in the Journal of the Royal Society Interface. This could one day enable multimodal locomotion for miniature robots with extended flight times.

According to the authors, grasshoppers have two sets of wings: forewings and hindwings. Forewings are mostly used for protection and camouflage, while the latter are involved in flapping and gliding, and are corrugated to allow them to fold into the insect’s body. The team took CT scans to capture the geometry of grasshopper wings and used the scans to 3D print model wings with varying designs. Next they tested each variant in a water channel to study how water flowed around the wing, isolating key features like a wing’s shape or corrugation to see how this impacted the flow.

Once they had perfected their design, they printed new wings and attached them to small frames to create grasshopper-sized gliders. The team then launched the gliders across the lab and used motion capture to evaluate how well they flew. The glider performed as well as actual grasshoppers. In addition, they found that a smooth wing resulted in more efficient gliding. So why do real grasshopper wings have corrugations? The authors suggest that these evolved because they help with executing steep angles.

Humanoid robots are fascinating, but nobody would mistake them for actual humans, in part because even the ones that have faces are far too limited in facial gestures, including lip motion—hence, the “Uncanny Valley.” Columbia University engineers have now created a robot capable of learning facial lip motions for speaking and singing. According to a paper published in Science Robotics, the resulting robotic face was able to speak words in several different languages and sing an AI-generated song. (Its AI-generated debut album is aptly titled hello world.).

What makes human faces so uniquely capable of expression are the dozens of muscles lying just under the skin. Robotic faces are rigid and hence only have a limited range of motion. The Columbia team built their robotic face out of flexible material augmented with 26 motors (actuators). The robot learned to how its face moved in response to different actuator activity by watching itself in a mirror as it attempted thousands of random facial expressions. Eventually it learned how to achieve specific facial gestures.

The next step was to let the robot watch recorded videos of humans talking and singing, augmented with an AI algorithm that enabled it to learn exactly how the human mouths moved when performing those tasks so it could lip sync along. The resulting lip motion wasn’t perfect;  the robot struggled with “B” and “W” sounds in particular. But the authors believe the robot will improve with more practice; combining this ability with ChatGPT or Gemini could further improve its lip-syncing ability.

In 2020, scientists analyzed the microbes found on several of Leonardo da Vinci’s drawings and discovered that each had its own distinct microbiome/. A second team, working with the Leonardo da Vinci DNA Project in France, collected and analyzed swabs taken from centuries-old art in a private collection housed in Florence, Italy. They concluded that microbial signatures could be used to differentiate artwork according to the materials used—dubbing this emerging subfield “arteomics.”

Yet another team collaborating with the project painstakingly assembled Leonardo’s family tree in 2021, spanning 21 generations from 1331 to the present, resulting a full-length book published last year. The idea was that this will one day provide a means of conducting DNA testing to confirm whether the bones interred in Leonardo’s grave are actually his. And now the project’s scientists are back with a preprint posted to the bioRxiv, announcing the successful sequencing of human DNA collected from a handful of artifacts associated with Leonardo—including a drawing of the Holy Child that some scholars attribute to Leonardo, as well as letters from a da Vinci family member.

The team lightly swabbed samples from the artifacts’ surfaces and were able to recover human Y-chromosome sequences from several of the samples. Several of these sequences were related and the authors speculate that some might even be Leonardo’s, although they cautioned that the samples would need to be compared to samples taken from the artist’s notebooks, burial site, and family tomb to make a definitive identification. The authors also found DNA from bacteria, fungi, flowers, and animals in some of the samples, as well as traces of viruses and parasites.

Lab-grown meat is often touted as a more environmentally responsible alternative to the real deal, but carnivorous consumers are often put off by the unappealing mouthfeel and texture (and, for me, a weird oily aftertaste). A new method using spent brewer’s yeast to make edible “scaffolding” for cultivating meat in the lab might one day offer a solution, according to a paper published in the journal Frontiers in  Nutrition.

Typically, a nutrient broth is used as a source of bacteria for the scaffolding. But Richard Day of University College London and his co-authors decided to use brewer’s yeast, usually discarded as waste, to culture a species of bacteria known for making high-quality cellulose. Then they tested the mechanical and structural properties of that cellulose with a “chewing machine.” They concluded that the cellulose made from spent brewer’s yeast was much closer in texture to real meat than the cellulose scaffolding made from a nutrient broth. The next step is to incorporate fat and muscle cells into the cellulose, as well as testing yeast from different kinds of beer.

Gears have been around for thousands of years; the Chinese were using them in two-wheeled chariots as far back as 3000 BCE, and they are a mainstay in windmills, clocks, and the famed Antikythera mechanism. Roboticists also use gears in their inventions, but whether they are made of wood, metal or plastic, such gears tend to be inflexible and hence more prone to breakage. That’s why New York University mathematician Leif Reistroph and colleagues decided to see if flowing air or water could be used to rotate robotic structures.

Ristroph’s lab frequently addresses all manner of colorful real-world puzzles: fine-tuning the recipe for the perfect bubble, for instance; exploring the physics of the Hula-Hoop; or the formation processes underlying so-called “stone forests” common in China and Madagascar. In 2021, his lab built a working Tesla valve, in accordance with the inventor’s design; the following year they studied the complex aerodynamics of what makes a good paper airplane—specifically what is needed for smooth gliding; and in 2024 they cracked the conundrum of the “reverse sprinkler” problem that physicists like Richard Feynman, among others, had grappled with since the 1940s.

For their latest paper, published in the journal Physical Review Letters, Ristroph et al. wanted to devise something that functioned like a gear only with flowing liquid driving the motion, instead of teeth grinding against each other. They conducted a series of experiments in which they immersed cylindrical rotors in a glycerol-and-water solution. One cylinder would rotate while the other was passive.

They found that the rotating cylinder, combined with fluid flow, was sufficient to induce rotation in the passive cylinder. The flows functioned much in the same way as gear teeth when the cylinders were close together. Moving the cylinders further apart caused the active cylinder to rotate faster, looping the flows around the passive cylinder—essentially mimicking a belt and pulley system.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">About a decade ago, many media outlets—including WIRED—zeroed in on a weird trend at the intersection of mental health, drug science, and Silicon Valley biohacking: microdosing, or the practice of taking a small amount of a psychedelic drug seeking not full-blown hallucinatory revels but gentler, more stable effects. Typically using psilocybin mushrooms or LSD, the archetypal microdoser sought less melting walls and open-eye kaleidoscopic visuals than boosts in mood and energy, like a gentle spring breeze blowing through the mind.

Anecdotal reports pitched microdosing as a kind of psychedelic Swiss Army knife, providing everything from increased focus to a spiked libido and (perhaps most promisingly) lowered reported levels of depression. It was a miracle for many. Others remained wary. Could 5 percent of a dose of acid really do all that? A new, wide-ranging study by an Australian biopharma company suggests that microdosing’s benefits may indeed be drastically overstated—at least when it comes to addressing symptoms of clinical depression.

A Phase 2B trial of 89 adult patients conducted by Melbourne-based MindBio Therapeutics, investigating the effects of microdosing LSD in the treatment of major depressive disorder, found that the psychedelic was actually outperformed by a placebo. Across an eight-week period, symptoms were gauged using the Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS), a widely recognized tool for the clinical evaluation of depression.

The study has not yet been published. But MindBio’s CEO Justin Hanka recently released the top-line results on his LinkedIn, eager to show that his company was “in front of the curve in microdosing research.” He called it “the most vigorous placebo controlled trial ever performed in microdosing.” It found that patients dosed with a small amount of LSD (ranging from 4 to 20μg, or micrograms, well below the threshold of a mind-blowing hallucinogenic dose) showed observable upticks in feelings of well-being, but worse MADRS scores, compared to patients given a placebo in the form of a caffeine pill. (Because patients in psychedelic trials typically expect some kind of mind-altering effect, studies are often blinded using so-called “active placebos,” like caffeine or methylphenidate, which have their own observable psychoactive properties.)

This means, essentially, that a medium-strength cup of coffee may prove more beneficial in treating major depressive disorder than a tiny dose of acid. Good news for habitual caffeine users, perhaps, but less so for researchers (and biopharma startups) counting on the efficacy of psychedelic microdosing.

“It’s probably a nail in the coffin of using microdosing to treat clinical depression,” Hanka says. “It probably improves the way depressed people feel—just not enough to be clinically significant or statistically meaningful.”

However despairing, these results conform with the suspicions of some more skeptical researchers, who have long believed that the benefits of microdosing are less the result of a teeny-tiny psychedelic catalyst, and more attributable to the so-called “placebo effect.”

In 2020, Jay A. Olson, then a PhD candidate in the Department of Psychiatry at McGill University in Montreal, Canada, conducted an experiment. He gave 33 participants a placebo, telling them it was actually a dose of a psilocybin-like drug. They were led to believe there was no placebo group. Other researchers who were in on the bit acted out the effects of the drug, in a room treated with trippy lighting and other visual stimulants, in an attempt to curate the “optimized expectation” of a psychedelic experience.

The resulting paper, titled “Tripping on Nothing,” found that a majority of participants had reported feeling the effects of the drug—despite there being no real drug whatsoever. “The main conclusion we had is that the placebo effect can be stronger than expected in psychedelic studies,” Olson, now a postdoctoral fellow at the University of Toronto, tells WIRED. “Placebo effects were stronger than what you would get from microdosing.”

More than a stick in the eye to the microdosing faithful, Olson maintains that the study’s key findings had more to do with the actual role, and power, of the placebo effect. “The public has a lot of misconceptions about the placebo effect,” he says. “There’s this assumption that placebo effects are extremely weak, or that they’re not real.”

Olson goes on to say that placebo effects in psychedelic trials can be further juiced by the hype around the drugs themselves. Patients may enter a trial expecting a certain experience, and their mind is able to conjure a version of that experience, in turn. In Olson’s study, it wasn’t a matter of microdosing effects not being real, but that those effects may be caused by environment, or patient expectation. As he puts it: “It can be true at the same time that microdosing can have positive effects on people, and that those effects are perhaps almost entirely placebo.”

This itself raises a sticky question about MindBio’s study. How could a placebo group, who thinks they’re taking LSD, perform better than an active control group, members of which both think they’re taking LSD and are actually taking it? The answer comes from the design of the study itself.

Using what’s called a “double-dummy” design, MindBio’s researchers informed patients that they’d either be receiving LSD, a caffeine pill, or a dose of methylphenidate, better known as Ritalin or Concerta. (No patients were actually administered the methylphenidate.) This means that patient expectation was lowered, as they could ascribe any perceived effects to either the LSD or either of the active placebos. Patients taking LSD microdoses may well have believed they were merely on a stimulant. All patients followed an adaptation of the “Fadiman protocol,” a popular microdosing programme that sees patients taking a small dose of the given drug once every three days.

Jim Fadiman, the veteran psychedelic researcher after whom the protocol is named, rejects MindBio’s conclusions, and trial design, out of hand. Because, Fadiman believes, patients were given the active caffeine placebo, their reported benefits may well be attributable not to a pure placebo effect, but to the actual psychoactive properties of that drug.

“Double-dummy is a remarkably apt term,” Fadiman, 86, sneers. “What I know is that if you take enough caffeine, you will not be depressed!”

Fadiman points to MindBio’s earlier, Phase 2A study, recently published in the journal Neuropharmacology, which drew markedly different conclusions. It was a non-blinded, so-called “open label” study, meaning patients knew definitely that they were being microdosed with LSD. This study found that MADRS scores decreased by 59.5 percent, with effects lasting as long as six months. It also found improvements in stress, rumination, anxiety, and patient quality of life. Fadiman says that this reportage is more consistent with his own research on microdosing. “Their prior study did wonderfully with LSD,” Fadiman says. “I have collected literally hundreds of real world reports over the years that validate those findings.”

MindBio’s Hanka stands by the science. “We are bewildered at the significant difference between the open label Phase 2A trial results and the Phase 2B trial results,” he says. “But that is the nature of good science—a properly controlled trial will get a proper result. Our Phase 2B trial was of the highest standard, a triple-blind, double-dummy, active placebo controlled trial. I haven’t seen another psychedelic trial that has gone to these lengths to control and blind a trial.”

Despite these findings, some microdosing true believers don’t seem especially shaken. In 2017, writer Ayelet Waldman (best known as the author of the Mommy-Track Mysteries series of novels that follow the adventures of stay-at-home-mom-cum-sleuth Juliet Applebaum) published A Really Good Day, a diaristic account of her own self-experiments using microdosing to treat an intractable mood disorder. She tells WIRED she’s not especially bothered by the implication that her positive shifts in mood may have merely been placebo. “In my book I took very seriously the possibility that what I was experiencing was the mother of all placebo effects,” Waldman says. “I wrote about this a number of times in various chapters and decided in the end it didn’t matter. What mattered was that I felt better.”

Perhaps that’s true enough. If the effects are measurable, and repeatable, then it should hardly matter if they’re attributable to a sub-perceptual dose of lysergic acid, or to the (perhaps equally profound) mysteries of the placebo. Still, one cannot help but wonder why anyone looking to use LSD to aid severe clinical depression would bother assuming the legal risk of procuring and consuming a drug still classified under Schedule I by the US Drug Enforcement Administration.

Certainly, for his part, Justin Hanka seems content to pivot MindBio’s research into a new field. His next project is “Booze A.I.”: a smartphone app that uses artificial intelligence to scan the human voice for relevant biomarkers that determine blood alcohol concentration. He’s leaving microdosing in the rearview. “I put millions of dollars into this myself,” he says. “Had I known six years ago what I know about psychedelics, I probably wouldn’t have ventured into the microdosing field.”

            <h2>The TV industry finally concedes that the future may not be in 8K</h2>
            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-01-30</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2026/01/lg-joins-the-rest-of-the-world-accepts-that-people-dont-want-8k-tvs/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Technology companies spent part of the 2010s trying to convince us that we would want an 8K display one day.

In 2012, Sharp brought the first 8K TV prototype to the CES trade show in Las Vegas. In 2015, the first 8K TVs started selling in Japan for 16 million yen (about $133,034 at the time), and in 2018, Samsung released the first 8K TVs in the US, starting at a more reasonable $3,500. By 2016, the Video Electronics Standards Association (VESA) had a specification for supporting 8K (Display Port1.4), and the HDMI Forum followed suit (with HDMI 2.1). By 2017, Dell had an 8K computer monitor. In 2019, LG released the first 8K OLED TV, further pushing the industry’s claim that 8K TVs were “the future.”

However, 8K never proved its necessity or practicality.

LG Display is no longer making 8K LCD or OLED panels, FlatpanelsHD reported today. Earlier this month, an LG Display representative told FlatpanelsHD that the panel supplier is “taking a comprehensive view of current display market trends and the trends within the 8K content ecosystem.”

“As our technical readiness is already complete, LG Display is fully prepared to respond immediately whenever the market and customers determine that the timing is right,” LG Display’s representative said.

LG Electronics was the first and only company to sell 8K OLED TVs, starting with the 88-inch Z9 in 2019. In 2022, it lowered the price-of-entry for an 8K OLED TV by $7,000 by charging $13,000 for a 76.7-inch TV.

FlatpanelsHD cited anonymous sources who said that LG Electronics would no longer restock the 2024 QNED99T, which is the last LCD 8K TV that it released.

LG’s 8K abandonment follows other brands distancing themselves from 8K. TCL, which released its last 8K TV in 2021, said in 2023 that it wasn’t making more 8K TVs due to low demand. Sony discontinued its last 8K TVs in April and is unlikely to return to the market, as it plans to sell the majority ownership of its Bravia TVs to TCL.

The tech industry tried to convince people that the 8K living room was coming soon. But since the 2010s, people have mostly adopted 4K. In September 2024, research firm Omdia reported that there were “nearly 1 billion 4K TVs currently in use.” In comparison, 1.6 million 8K TVs had been sold since 2015, Paul Gray, Omdia’s TV and video technology analyst, said, noting that 8K TV sales peaked in 2022.

That helps explain why membership at the 8K Association, launched by stakeholders Samsung, TCL, Hisense, and panel maker AU Optronics in 2019, is dwindling. As of this writing, the group’s membership page lists 16 companies, including just two TV manufacturers (Samsung and Panasonic). Membership no longer includes any major TV panel suppliers. At the end of 2022, the 8K Association had 33 members, per an archived version of the nonprofit’s online membership page via the Internet Archive’s Wayback Machine. Upon its debut, the 8K Association said that its goals include “promoting 8K TVs and 8K content to consumers and professionals” and “helping secure 8K native content for members.”

It wasn’t hard to predict that 8K TVs wouldn’t take off. In addition to being too expensive for many households, there’s been virtually zero native 8K content available to make investing in an 8K display worthwhile. An ongoing lack of content was also easy to predict, given that there’s still a dearth of 4K content, and many streaming, broadcasting, and gaming users still rely on 1920×1080 resolution.

Gaming was supposed to be one of the best drivers for 8K adoption. The PlayStation 5 (PS5) Pro was originally marketed as supporting 8K. Sony officially rescinded that promise in June 2024, though. Due to bandwidth limitations, the PS5 Pro could only deliver 8K via Display Stream Compression over HDMI 2.1, making the feature incompatible with some 8K TVs.

There’s also the crucial question of whether people would even notice the difference between 4K and 8K. Science suggests that you could, but in limited situations.

The University of Cambridge’s display resolution calculator, which is based on a study from researchers at the university’s Department of Computer Science and Technology and Meta, funded by Meta, and published in Nature in October, suggests that your eyes can only make use of 8K resolution on a 50-inch screen if you’re viewing it from a distance of 1 meter (3.3 feet) or less. Similarly, you would have to be sitting pretty close (2–3 meters/6.6–9.8 feet) to an 80-inch or 100-inch TV for 8K resolution to be beneficial. The findings are similar to those from RTINGs.com.

Even those interested in spending a lot of money on new-age TV technologies are more likely to investigate features other than 8K, like OLED, HDR support, Micro LED, quantum dots, or even the newer Micro RGB panel tech. Any of those is likely to have a more dramatic impact on home theaters than moving from 4K to 8K.

With the above-mentioned obstacles, many technologists foresaw 8K failing to live up to tech companies’ promises. That’s not to say that 8K is dead. You can still buy an 8K TV from Samsung, which has 8K TVs with MSRPs starting at $2,500 (for 65 inches), and LG (until stock runs out). With manufacturers refraining from completely ruling out a return to 8K, it’s possible that 8K TVs will become relevant for enthusiasts or niche use cases for many years. And there are uses for high-resolution displays outside of TVs, like in head-mounted displays.

However, 8K TV options are shrinking. We’re far from the days when companies argued over which had the most “real 8K” TVs. If there is a future where 8K TVs reign, it’s one far from today.</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Minnesota resident Nicole Cleland had her Global Entry and TSA Precheck privileges revoked three days after an incident in which she observed activity by immigration agents, the woman said in a court declaration. An agent told Cleland that he used facial recognition technology to identify her, she wrote in a declaration filed in US District Court for the District of Minnesota.

Cleland, a 56-year-old resident of Richfield and a director at Target Corporation, volunteers with a group that tracks potential Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and Customs and Border Protection (CBP) vehicles in her neighborhood, according to her declaration. On the morning of January 10, she “observed a white Dodge Ram being driven by what I believed to be federal enforcement agents” and “maneuvered behind the vehicle with the intent of observing the agents’ actions.”

Cleland said that she and another observer in a different car followed the Dodge Ram because of “concern about a local apartment building being raided.” She followed the car for a short time and from a safe distance until “the Dodge Ram stopped in front of the other commuter’s vehicle,” she wrote. Cleland said two other vehicles apparently driven by federal agents stopped in front of the Dodge Ram, and her path forward was blocked.

“An agent exited the vehicle and approached my vehicle,” Cleland wrote. “I remained in my vehicle. The agent addressed me by my name and informed me that they had ‘facial recognition’ and that his body cam was recording. The agent stated that he worked for border patrol. He wore full camouflage fatigues. The agent stated that I was impeding their work. He indicated he was giving me a verbal warning and if I was found to be impeding again, I would be arrested.”

Cleland acknowledged that she heard what the agent said, and they drove off in opposite directions, according to her declaration. Cleland submitted the declaration on January 21 in a lawsuit filed by Minnesota residents against US government officials with the Department of Homeland Security and ICE. Cleland’s court filing was mentioned yesterday in a Boston Globe column about tactics used by ICE agents to intimidate protesters.

Cleland said she could “discern no reason why the agents stopped me other than the fact that I was following them.” But on January 13, she received an email notification that her Global Entry and TSA Precheck privileges for passing through airport security were revoked, she said. Cleland said the revocation appears to be a form of intimidation and retaliation:

I logged onto the Global Entry site and the notification letter indicated that indeed my status had been revoked and that they can’t always disclose the reason. The notification did provide some reasons that my status may have changed and the only one that makes sense was “The applicant has been found in violation of any customs, immigration, or agriculture regulations, procedures, or laws in any country.” I was not detained, I was not arrested so [it is] difficult to understand how I was “found in violation.”

I had been a member of the Global Entry program since 2014 without incident. I am not particularly concerned with the revocation of my privileges in isolation. However, given that only three days had passed from the time that I was stopped, I am concerned that the revocation was the result of me following and observing the agents. This is intimidation and retaliation. I was following Legal Observer laws. I [was] within my rights to be doing what I was doing.

Cleland said she and her husband travel frequently, and she is worried that they may encounter problems going forward.

“I am concerned that border patrol and other federal enforcement agencies now have my license plate and personal information, and that I may be detained or arrested again in the future,” she wrote. “I am concerned about further actions that could be taken against me or my family. I have instructed my family to be cautious and return inside if they see unfamiliar vehicles outside of our home.”

Cleland said she hasn’t performed any observation of federal agents since January 10, but has “continued to engage in peaceful protests” and is “assessing when I will return to active observations.”

We contacted the Department of Homeland Security about Cleland’s declaration and will update this article if we get a response.

Federal agents have made extensive use of facial recognition during President Trump’s immigration crackdown with technology from Clearview AI and a face-scanning app called Mobile Fortify. They use facial recognition technology both to verify citizenship and identify protesters.

“Ms. Cleland was one of at least seven American citizens told by ICE agents this month that they were being recorded with facial recognition technology in and around Minneapolis, according to local activists and videos posted to social media,” The New York Times reported today, adding that none of the people had given consent to be recorded.

ICE also uses a variety of other technologies, including cell-site simulators (or Stingrays) to track phone locations, and Palantir software to help identify potential deportation targets.

Although Cleland vowed to continue protesting and eventually get back to observing ICE and CBP agents, her declaration said she felt intimidated after the recent incident.

“The interaction with the agents on January 10th made me feel angry and intimidated,” she wrote. “I have been through Legal Observer Training and know my rights. I believe that I did not do anything that warranted being stopped in the way that I was on January 10th.”</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">We’ve come across video after video of humanoid robots performing backflips, delivering punches — and even a clip of a robot kicking the CEO of its maker squarely in the chest.

Don’t get us wrong, the aerobatics on display are impressive — but it’s not hugely practical, since it’s not like we’re being swarmed by waves of armed bad guys on a daily basis.

Fortunately, not every robotics maker is doubling down on martial arts. Case in point, California-based company Figure recently introduced the second iteration of its humanoid robot AI software, called Helix 02. In a video released this week, the company’s black-and-white android, dubbed Figure 02, can be seen seamlessly unloading a dishwasher and placing clean dishes in upper cabinets and drawers before loading dirty dishes back into it.

It’s an impressive demo. Certain human-like flourishes highlight how Helix 02 was relying on motion-captured training data, from using its foot to kick up the opened dishwasher door to bumping a drawer closed with its hip.

The company claims in a press release that a “single neural system” can control the “full body directly from pixels, enabling dexterous, long horizon autonomy across an entire room.”

The dishwasher demonstration is a “four-minute, end-to-end autonomous task that integrates walking, manipulation, and balance with no resets and no human intervention,” per Figure. “We believe this is the longest horizon, most complex task completed autonomously by a humanoid robot to date.”

Helix 02’s dishwasher mastery was the result of being trained on over 1,000 hours of “human motion data and sim‑to‑real reinforcement learning,” the company claimed. And it’s not a one-hit wonder: we’ve already seen Figure 02 deftly sort packages at a logistics warehouse, load a washing machine, and even fold laundry.

However, how the robot would fare in a different — and perhaps far messier — kitchen remains to be seen. Flashy tech demos like this one should always be taken with a grain of salt, particularly when they’re meant to convey how robots could one day navigate an unpredictable real-world environment, rather than a carefully set-up and controlled stage.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">New York City’s mayor isn’t even a month into his term, and he’s already delivering a crushing blow to delivery app companies.

In a bombshell intervention, Zohran Mamdani and Department of Consumer and Worker Protection commissioner Sam Levine announced that three delivery apps will be forced to repay $4.6 million in wages held back from deliveristas, New York City’s app-based delivery workers.

According to NYC Streetblog, the three main culprits being forced to settle are Uber Eats, Fantuan, and Hungry Panda. The three settlements were the result of a sweeping investigation into broader delivery app practices, which included GrubHub and DoorDash.

“The era of giant corporations juicing profits by underpaying workers is over,” Levine said in a statement. “I’m proud that this agency is not only returning full back pay, but is recovering damages and penalties to send a strong message that cheating workers will not be tolerated.”

Per the mayoral administration, Uber Eats unfairly deactivated and underpaid thousands of workers between December 4, 2023, and September 2, 2024. It’s now being forced to pay $3,150,000 in worker relief penalties across over 48,000 workers, in amounts ranging from $8.79 to $276.15.

In addition, Uber Eats will have to pay the city of New York $350,000 in civil fines — a drop in the bucket compared to the $13.7 billion in revenue the company brought in throughout 2024, but a win for the worker-friendly administration all the same.

The decision strikes a major blow to an industry that has historically relied on its political and financial largess to avoid consequences for horrifying worker abuses resulting from algorithmic management systems.

“For years, app companies treated the law as optional — hiding behind algorithms, stealing wages, and deactivating workers without consequence,” Ligia Guallpa, executive director of the Workers’ Justice Project, told NYC Streetblog in a statement. “The scale of these abuses proves what deliveristas have been saying for years: exploitation is not an accident — it’s baked into the app delivery business model.”

James Parrott, a senior fellow at the Center for New York City Affairs at The New School, concurred.

“For far too long, delivery and other online labor platform companies have not only underpaid workers, but deactivated them with abandon, denying workers the ability to make a living,” he said.

Perhaps surprisingly, Uber hasn’t denied any wrongdoing and went as far as to thank officials for bringing light to the issue.

In a statement to NYC Streetblog, Uber spokesman Josh Gold said that “we’re glad to have this resolved.”

“After DCWP notified us of the issue in August 2024, we immediately corrected it, agreed to pay more than the amount owed, and appreciate the new administration moving quickly to bring this to a fair conclusion,” he said.

            <h2>New Study Examines How Often AI Psychosis Actually Happens, and the Results Are Not Good</h2>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">We’ve seen plenty of evidence suggesting that prolonged use of popular AI chatbots like ChatGPT can coax some users into spirals of paranoid and delusional behavior.

The phenomenon, dubbed “AI psychosis,” is a very real problem, with researchers warning of a huge wave of severe mental health crises brought on by the tech. In extreme cases, especially involving people with pre-existing conditions, the breaks with reality have even been linked suicides and murder.

Now, thanks to a yet-to-be-peer-reviewed paper published by researchers at Anthropic and the University of Toronto, we’re beginning to grasp just how widespread the issue really is.

The researchers set out to quantify patterns of what they called “user disempowerment” in “real-world [large language model] usage” — including what they call “reality distortion,” “belief distortion,” and “action distortion” to denote a range of situations in which AI twists users’ sense of reality, beliefs, or pushes them into taking actions.

The results tell a damning story. The researchers found that one in 1,300 conversations out of almost 1.5 million analyzed chats with Anthropic’s Claude led to reality distortion, and one in 6,000 conversations led to action distortion.

To come to their conclusion, the researchers ran 1.5 million Claude conversations through an analysis tool called Clio to identify instances of “disempowerment.”

On the face, that may not sound like a huge proportion given the scale of the much larger dataset — but in absolute numbers, the research highlights a phenomenon that’s affecting huge numbers of people.

“We find the rates of severe disempowerment potential are relatively low,” the researchers concluded. “For instance, severe reality distortion potential, the most common severe-level primitive, occurs in fewer than one in every thousand conversations.”

“Nevertheless, given the scale of AI usage, even these low rates translate to meaningful absolute numbers,” they added. “Our findings highlight the need for AI systems designed to robustly support human autonomy and flourishing.”

Worse yet, they found evidence that the prevalence of moderate or severe disempowerment increased between late 2024 and late 2025, indicating that the problem is growing as AI use spreads.

“As exposure grows, users might become more comfortable discussing vulnerable topics or seeking advice,” the researchers wrote in the blog post.

Additionally, the team found that user feedback — in the form of an optional thumbs up or down button at the end of a given conversation with Claude — indicated that users “rate potentially disempowering interactions more favorably,” according to an accompanying blog post on Anthropic’s website.

In other words, users are more likely to come away satisfied when their reality or beliefs are being distorted, highlighting the role of sycophancy, or the strong tendency of AI chatbots to validate a user’s feelings and beliefs.

Plenty of fundamental questions remain. The researchers were upfront about admitting that they “can’t pinpoint why” the prevalence of moderate or severe disempowerment potential is growing. Their dataset is also limited to Claude consumer traffic, “which limits generalizability.” We also don’t know how many of these identified cases led to real-world harm, as the research only focused on “disempowerment potential” and not “confirmed harm.”

The team called for improved “user education” to make sure people aren’t giving up their full judgment to AI as “model-side interventions are unlikely to fully address the problem.”

Nonetheless, the researchers say the research is only a “first step” to learn how “AI might undermine human agency.”

“We can only address these patterns if we can measure them,” they argued.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">For years, the cultivated meat industry has struggled to emerge as a practical alternative to the brutal factory farming sector. The key reason? Perhaps not that lab grown meat isn’t a viable product, but that intense regulations have strangled it in the cradle.

A new analysis by the food industry publication Just Food found that the majority of cultivated meat companies — those working to bring cell-cultured meat to market — have struggled thanks to a lack of regulatory approvals from government food agencies. Despite a ton of early investor interest in these kinds of companies and an increasingly competitive price point, many are being forced to shutter operations before they can get a product to shelves.

“While it’s disappointing to see company closures, as with any highly innovative sector, not all companies will make it through the tough early stages,” Carlotte Lucas, industry head at Good Food Institute Europe told Just Food.

“However, regulatory inefficiencies, such as longer, unpredictable approval times, have been a critical barrier for companies hoping to bring products to market and have led to some start-ups considering other regions or even relocating overseas,” Lucas continued.

Without regulatory approval in regions like Europe and North America, lab-grown meat startups can’t scale their operations into the kinds of consumer markets that have expressed interest in alternative meats. Instead, they tend to find niche buyers in the restaurant industry, with mixed success.

“While the regulatory work is essential, it’s very resource intensive, it’s very time intensive, and each player needs to go through that process,” Erika Georget, managing director of The Cultured Hub told Just Food.

Georget suggests that scaling up biomass production is essential for success in the lab-grown meat industry — biomass referring to the animal cells utilized in growing cultivated meat. It puts lab-grown meat companies in a paradoxical bind: startups need regulatory approval to scale commercially, but also need commercial scale to survive the regulatory process.

“Even for those that have had approval for restaurants and so on, a challenge is that companies don’t have enough quantity yet to really serve a classical retail business and at an acceptable cost based on pure biomass,” Georget told the outlet.

Until regulators create clearer, faster pathways to approval, cultivated meat risks becoming a cautionary tale of urgently-needed innovation killed by bureaucratic overreach.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">A couple says their Tesla Cybertruck nearly dumped their baby onto the side of the highway after its passenger door latch failed, The Oaklandside reports.

The husband, Oakland resident Viral Shah, says he and his wife were driving up a ramp to get on the highway when the back passenger door next to their one-year-old child suddenly swung open. Shah and his wife screamed and immediately pulled over to check on their kid. Fortunately, the car seat saved the baby from being flung out the car, but it was an alarmingly close call. And had the 60-pound stainless steel-clad door swung back closed, it could have smashed the child’s hand or arm.

If anyone had been sitting back there without a seatbelt, Shah told The Oaklandside, “they would’ve been mush on the street.” His wife had to take the child’s seat, buckle herself in, and hold the door closed for the rest of the drive home. ​​”This is f*cking nuts,” she said, Shah recalled.

Upon inspecting the passenger door, Shah discovered that the metal loop that the car door latch hooked into, called a striker, was missing one of its two screws and had come loose. He also found that the driver door had a screw loose as well. Alarmed, he submitted a complaint to the National High Traffic Safety Administration.

“That’s what made me really scared and furious, because this wasn’t a simple defect,” he told The Oaklandside. “This wasn’t an oversight with one thing where shit happens. This was a systemic design flaw that was affecting those two doors because they were the most heavily used.”

“There’s no doubt in my mind the same thing would happen to all four doors had they been used with the same level of frequency,” he added.

An expert who reviewed photos and videos taken by Shah and his wife suspected that the “weld-nuts” on the backside of the door’s steel pillar appeared to improperly welded, gradually dislodging as the doors were shut.

“This should never, ever happen, but weld-nuts do occasionally break free if there is a process or setup error in the welding equipment or if protective coatings that are used to limit corrosion during shipping of parts are not properly cleaned,” Sam Abuelsamid, a car engineer and vice president of market research at Telemetry, told Oaklandside.

The Cybertruck has been recalled a staggering ten times, a number that probably flatters the vehicle, as it has been accused of all kinds of serious reliability issues beyond those that became official record. Many of the recalls, in any case, were pretty serious. One was for its accelerator pedal getting stuck in the down position, and another was for losing power while driving. It’s also been recalled for other body-related issues, including its stainless steel panels flying off because they were adhered with crummy glue.

The latches aren’t the only apparent issue. Other aspects of the electric doors, which do not have a traditional handle, have been criticized for being unsafe. The doors are operated by a push button from both the outside and inside, systems that can easily fail in an accident. And critics say its emergency release mechanisms are too hidden and impractical. In 2024, three recent high school graduates died after being trapped in a Cybertruck that crashed and caught fire. A bystander at the scene tried to let them free, but couldn’t open the electric doors after the buttons failed.

Shah said that after his incident, he took the vehicle to a Tesla service center, which admitted on an invoice that the rear passenger door was “damaged due to a loose striker.” Tesla offered to buy back the vehicle for nearly its full purchase price, so long as he agreed not to sue the automaker. He took the offer.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">How the most massive objects in the universe first formed is one of the biggest headscratchers in astrophysics. With more advanced telescopes, astronomers have found fully formed galaxies and colossal black holes earlier and earlier in the cosmos, just a few hundred million years after the Big Bang. This shouldn’t be enough time for these structures to reach their incredible size; to astronomers, it’s like stumbling on a fully-grown oak tree that’s only a year old.

The dilemma was put into hyperdrive by the James Webb Space Telescope’s discovery of extremely bright “Little Red Dots” that were present when the universe was less than a billion years old, and are nowhere to be seen today. Though they’re suspected to be some kind of compact galaxy, they would be almost impossibly dense at the mass they appear to have, wall-to-wall with stars, according to Vadim Rusakov, an astronomer at the University of Manchester and lead author of a new study investigating the red objects published in the journal Nature.

“They would need to produce stars at 100 percent efficiency, and that’s not what we’re used to seeing,” he told Ars Technica. “Galaxies cannot produce stars at more than 20 percent efficiency, at least that’s what our current knowledge is.”

Another proposed explanation is that they’re some kind of supermassive black hole. But this, too, is fraught: the red dots show no signs of the x-ray emissions produced by these objects. And if they were black holes, they would be “overmassive,” weighing nearly as much as their entire surrounding galaxy, something that’s never been observed in a conventional galaxy. How such an enormous monstrosity could form when the universe was still in its infancy is equally baffling.

Thankfully, there may be a very tidy explanation. In his study, Rusakov and his team found that the gasses observed in the Little Red Dots, which astronomers use to infer the mass of invisible black holes, weren’t moving as quickly as once thought. If so, that means that the black holes are around 100 times less massive than previously estimated.

The upshot is that the supposedly “overmassive” behemoths are actually just young supermassive black holes. But if that’s the case, why don’t they resemble any black holes that we’re seeing today? The astronomers suggests that we may be witnessing a previously unknown “cocoon” stage of their evolution, during which they feed off of a dense, protective shell of ionized gas.

“They look like a [developing] butterfly or something in this young state that kind of grows wrapped in some sort of gas that also feeds it,” Rusakov told Ars. “It’s definitely new in the sense people didn’t predict there should be such a cocoon phase in the supermassive black holes’ lifecycle.”

In addition to feeding the black hole, the cocoon would also block the x-ray emissions we would expect to see, explaining their absence.

It’s probably one of the tidiest solutions out there to the Little Red Dots mystery, though there are more than a few. Other research suggests that they’re galaxies which are unusually tiny because they haven’t spun up to speed. An even bolder hypothesis proposes they’re “black hole stars” consisting of a black hole core surrounded by a sphere of gas so dense that it resembles the outer layers of a star. But if Rusakov and his team are on the right track, it raises another significant question that’s been haunting astronomers. “Does the galaxy start with the supermassive black hole or with the stars?” Rusakov pondered. “Is that a chicken or the egg?”

“We don’t know exactly what happens in this first sort of stage of galaxy formation,” he added. “But our model gives us a new way to look at this kind of object.

In our mature cosmos, black holes are formed from the collapse of dying star, but in the earliest moments of its existence, the extreme conditions may have given birth to these objects all around, long before the first stars would be born.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Social network UpScrolled, which gained prominence after TikTok’s ownership change in the U.S. in January, has zoomed past 2.5 million users, the company’s founder Issam Hijazi said during Web Summit Qatar.

“We launched about six months ago, and we grew to about 150,000 up until early January. And as of the last few days, we reached over one million users globally.  Now, starting today, we surpassed two-and-a-half million users globally,” Hijazi said.

UpScrolled is a blend of Instagram and X, and claims to be inclusive of all voices. The company says that it allows for all kinds of content and doesn’t shadowban or censor people.

During his speech, Hijazi called out big tech companies for being unethical and selling user data for profit, and accused social networks of suppressing pro-Palestinian content and choosing to censor users selectively.

“They don’t care about selling your data to someone else if that means profit for them. And they don’t care about your mental health, as in they will design something just to keep you addicted to using that platform as long as it’s profitable for them,” he said.

Users on other platforms have complained about UpScrolled hosting a lot of porn and nudity. Hijazi noted that while the company won’t rely on amplification algorithms to boost or suppress certain views, it would have community guidelines in place to comply with laws in different regions. The company is gathering a team of experts to solidify its community guidelines and is also taking user feedback into account, he added.

The company hasn’t announced any funding publicly, but Hijazi said that the social network has been getting investor interest.

In January, TikTok switched to a new ownership structure in the U.S. with a consortium consisting of investors like Silver Lake and Oracle taking a majority share of the company while ByteDance retained 20% ownership. That change led to many users exploring other social networks. Apart from UpScrolled, AT Protocol-based Skylight also gained attention, crossing 380,000 users in the days following the finalization of the TikTok deal.

While these social networks might have benefited from a short-term boost following organizational changes at TikTok, they will have to build features and a community to retain users. They will also have to form moderation policies and take content decisions that might not be popular with their user base, as Bluesky has discovered over the last few years.

            <div id="article-text">Sometimes, you might be sitting on a hot product and not know it until the market demands it.

After launching as a digital business card that doubled as a lead capture tool for sales teams, Birmingham, Alabama-based Linq pivoted a few times before landing on an idea last year: helping businesses better communicate with their customers by upgrading from SMS (text) to iMessage and RCS.

Now, Apple already lets businesses do this via its Messages for Business service, and Twilio has built a $18.26 billion business by helping companies text their customers. But users can always tell when they’re talking to a business — the texts are displayed in gray, and the branding is often obvious.

Linq’s customers, though, wanted to be able to send blue-bubble messages to their customers, not green or gray, to lend an air of authenticity to their communications.

The startup, founded by former Shipt executives Elliott Potter (CEO), Patrick Sullivan (CTO), and Jared Mattsson (President), heard that feedback and launched an API in February 2025 that lets companies message their customers natively within iMessage, leveraging all the capabilities Apple’s platform offers to iPhone users, like group chats, emojis, threaded replies, images and voice notes. Within eight months, Linq had doubled its annual recurring revenue it had built over four years, co-founder and CEO Elliott Potter told TechCrunch.

Linq was not content with its newfound product-market-fit, however, as the advent of AI agents gave the company an even larger market to sell its tech to. That idea was sparked by an AI assistant called Poke that can handle tasks, answer questions, and schedule your calendar from inside iMessage was a key catalyst in the company’s refocusing on the agentic market.

“In spring of last year, this company came to us, called the Interaction Company of California, and they were building this AI assistant called poke.com and they were like, ‘Hey, we we don’t have a CRM, but we really want to use your API’,” Potter told TechCrunch.

Poke went viral at launch last September, which, Potter says, led to his team being inundated with requests for tapping their messaging API. All of a sudden, a slew of AI companies wanted to offer their chatbots and assistants directly through iMessage, RCS, and SMS.

Linq now had a decision to make: stick with its original, steady revenue stream from serving B2B clients, or pivot once again to leverage its tech stack and become an infrastructure layer for a new segment of the AI market.

“We still love our sales customers, and we love that use case, but our choices were, do we stay a spoke of this wheel, or do we build the hub? Do we focus on being the infrastructure layer for all these different applications of programmatic messaging?”

Potter thinks that consumers are suffering from app fatigue; but with Linq’s technology, there’s no need to use another app to interact with AI assistants as they can all live within their messaging app. Also, developers won’t have to worry about building an app since they can just build for a messaging-native interface instead.

“Poke.com, along with others, have proved that AI has gotten good enough,” Potter said. “You don’t need a traditional app anymore to do things. Really, you just need an interface that will let you talk to an intelligent enough AI, maybe connect it to some of your systems, and just tell it what to do, and give it feedback.”

Linq ended up pivoting, and it says its customer base has expanded by 132% from the previous quarter, and on average its customer accounts have expanded by 34%. Its customers’ AI agents now reach 134,000 monthly active users via the platform. The company claims it facilitates more than 30 million messages per month, resulting in net revenue retention of 295% with zero churn.

To continue building its tech, the company said on Monday it has raised $20 million in a Series A funding round led by TQ Ventures. Mucker Capital and some angel investors also participated. The company plans to use the fresh cash to expand its team, develop a new go-to-market motion, and continue building its tech. Linq did not disclose its valuation.

Rosy outlook aside, the reality is that Linq is still building on top of Apple’s platform — at least for now. There’s no telling if Apple will pull a Meta and bar third parties from offering AI chatbots on its platform. Besides, iMessage is popular in the U.S., but the rest of the world also uses other messaging services like WhatsApp, WeChat, Telegram, and Signal.

Potter, however, says Linq’s eventual goal lies beyond messaging. “Our vision for the platform is everything you need to build conversational tech, and that’s not limited to a few channels. Right now, we have programmatic voice, we have iMessage, RCS, SMS. That’s just the beginning. Our ambition is, wherever your customers are, you should be able to talk to them, be it Slack, be it email, be it Telegram, WhatsApp, Discord, Signal, anywhere your customers are, and can converse.”

“By making AI-to-human communication as frictionless as texting a friend, Linq is enabling an entirely new category of companies,” Andrew Marks, co-founding Partner of TQ Ventures, said in a statement. “Linq’s founding team is extraordinary, and we have no doubt in their ability to execute on this massive opportunity.”

            <div id="article-text">Digital meeting notetakers like Read AI, Fireflies.ai, Fathom, and Granola help record and transcribe online meetings. But for in-person or more versatile options, many people prefer physical recording devices These physical notetakers transcribe audio and give users summaries and action items of meetings using AI.

Some of these devices are wearable—pins or pendants with dedicated mics for recording—while others are credit-card sized with dedicated mobile apps to transcribe and extract insights using AI. A few even offer live translation.

Below is a non-exhaustive list of physical AI notetakers and transcription tools.

This credit card-sized notetaker has been around since 2023, with a newer, AI-powered Pro version that has a small screen, four mics, and records audio within three to five meters. It also can switch between in-person recording and call recording.

The Plaud Note costs $159, while the Note Pro costs $179. They come with 300 minutes of transcription free per month.

Mobvi’s rectangular notetaker is priced at $159 and includes 600 free transcription minutes. The company claims the device shows real-time transcription and translation with support for more than 120 languages. The device offers 25 hours of continuous recording through its three microphones.

In terms of software features, the TicNote offers automatic highlight extraction and the ability to create audio clips or summarized podcast versions of a conversation.

Comulytic is a newer entrant in the hardware AI notetaker market. The company’s claim for differentiation is that its $159 Note Pro device doesn’t require any additional subscription for basic transcription. That means you can transcribe unlimited minutes by just buying the device.

The device can record up to 45 hours of audio continuously on a single charge and has more than 100 days of standby time.

The company has a $15 per month or $119 per year advanced plan that offers instant AI summaries, unlimited templates for summaries, an action item list, and chat with AI assistant without any limits.

Plaud NotePin and NotePin S are the smaller and more pocketable versions of the company’s larger Note and Note Pro devices. The NotePin has a versatile design: You can wear it as a wrist band, a pendant, clip it to your bag, or wear it on your shirt with a magnetic attachment. Notably, the lanyard and wristband are only available with the NotePin S.

Both devices have two mics, and can record around 20 hours of audio continuously on a single charge. The NotePin S has a physical button to start/stop recording and capture highlights.

Both are similarly priced to their credit-card-shaped counterparts. The NotePin is priced at $159, and the NotePin S is priced at $179.

The Omi pendant is a cheaper alternative to other notetakers at $89. This is because the pendant has to be connected to your phone and doesn’t have any onboard memory. The device has two mics and can run for 10 to 14 hours on a charge.

While Omi has its own app, you can use other apps as the hardware and software are open-sourced. Users have also built different connectors and apps for the device.

Viaim’s earbuds allow for transcription during calls, with additional recording capabilities in the earbuds’ case. These buds are priced at $200 and Viaim claims they can transcribe audio in up to 78 languages in real-time. The company’s app can also highlight key points in transcriptions.

Anker’s Soundcore Work pin is a coin-sized AI notetaker with a puck-shaped battery pack. The $159 device can record for eight hours without breaks, or up to 32 hours if the pin is attached to its case, the company says.

Anker claims that the device has a five-meter recording range. Users get 300 minutes of transcription free per month.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">TikTok, which is under new ownership in the U.S., said Sunday that it has restored service after outages last week that marred user experiences. The social network has over 220 million users in the U.S.

The company blamed last week’s snowstorm, which caused an outage at an Oracle-operated data center responsible for TikTok operations.

“We have successfully restored TikTok back to normal after a significant outage caused by winter weather took down a primary U.S. data center site operated by Oracle. The winter storm led to a power outage which caused network and storage issues at the site and impacted tens of thousands of servers that help keep TikTok running in the U.S. This affected many of TikTok’s core features—from content posting and discovery to the real-time display of video likes and view counts,” the company said in a post on X.

In January, the U.S. finalized the deal to create a separate entity for TikTok. A U.S.-based investor consortium called TikTok USDS took a controlling 80% stake, with the remaining 20% ownership held by ByteDance.

Following the deal finalization — which coincided with the snowstorm — users experienced glitches in features like posting, searching within the app, slower load times, and time-outs. TikTok noted that creators might see zero views on their posts until the problem was resolved. Later, the company said that it was working on solving the issue, but outages persisted, and users faced problems with posting content.

TikTok’s transition to a new ownership structure, paired with app snafus and user experience glitches, was beneficial for some other social networks. The Mark Cuban-backed short video app Skylight, which is built on the AT protocol, saw its user base soar to more than 380,000 users in the week the deal was finalized. Upscrolled, a social network by Palestinian-Jordanian-Australian technologist Issam Hijazi, also climbed in App Store rankings to reach the second spot in the social media category in the U.S. The app was downloaded 41,000 times within days of the TikTok deal’s finalization, according to analyst firm AppFigures.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">How many of the companies with recent layoffs are truly adapting their workforces to the efficiencies and challenges of artificial intelligence? And how many of them were just using AI as an excuse to cover other problems?

That’s the question posed by a New York Times article on the trend of “AI-washing,” where companies will cite AI as the reason for layoffs that might actually be caused by other factors, like over-hiring during the pandemic.

AI was the stated reason for more than 50,000 layoffs in 2025, with Amazon and Pinterest among the tech companies who blamed the technology for recent cuts.

But a Forrester report published in January argued, “Many companies announcing A.I.-related layoffs do not have mature, vetted A.I. applications ready to fill those roles, highlighting a trend of ‘A.I.-washing’ — attributing financially motivated cuts to future A.I. implementation.”

Molly Kinder, a senior research fellow at the Brookings Institute, noted that saying layoffs were caused by AI is a “very investor-friendly message,” especially when the alternative might mean admitting, “The business is ailing.”

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">If you read the news, you might have noticed a trend this past week. In addition to splashy features in Fortune and Bloomberg, Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino talked with Reuters, He also talked with TechCrunch. Why did the man behind the stablecoin that everyone loves to hate launch a full-scale media blitz?

The timing isn’t arbitrary. This week, Tether launched USAT, a U.S.-regulated stablecoin issued through Anchorage Digital Bank — its first product designed to comply with new federal rules and compete directly with Circle’s USDC. Fidelity Investments also just launched a competing stablecoin on Wednesday, joining JPMorgan Chase and PayPal in a broadening race.

It’s a big shift from one extreme to the other. For years, Ardoino avoided the United States, watching from offshore as regulators circled and prosecutors investigated. His company was portrayed as opaque, possibly fraudulent, and, according to a piece by The Economist last summer, a “money launderer’s dream.”

But when Ardoino and I chatted by video call this week, it was clear those days are over. Tether is meeting with White House officials, collaborating with the FBI and Secret Service, and betting USAT can break Circle’s grip on the U.S. market. (USAT is separate from Tether’s flagship USDT, which has $187 billion in circulation globally but doesn’t meet new U.S. regulatory requirements.) Speaking from Lugano, Switzerland, where Tether maintains an office, the 41-year-old – who joined the company just two months after its 2014 launch – spent over an hour describing Tether’s transformation from a crypto play to mainstream acceptance.

Its momentum is undeniable, certainly. Tether’s USDT — essentially a digital dollar that uses blockchain technology to move across borders without being tied to any single institution — has a market capitalization larger than all of its stablecoin competitors combined. It also has some 536 million users, growing at 30 million per quarter. “It’s growing at a pace more like Facebook rather than any other fintech application,” Ardoino tells me.

Tether’s first-mover advantage goes beyond market dominance, says Ardoino, describing it as transformative for people in countries with weak currencies. “In Argentina, the peso lost 94.5% of its value against the U.S. dollar in the last five years,” he observes. “In Haiti, the average salary is $1.34 per day. These people were never part of the financial system.”

“What Tether created is the biggest financial inclusion success story in the history of humanity,” he continues.

Ardoino knows he has a lot of work to do to convert more people into believers. It didn’t help when, last summer, The Economist detailed how Russian money launderer Ekaterina Zhdanova allegedly used Tether to connect British drug gangs, Moscow hackers, sanctioned oligarchs, and Russian intelligence operatives.

When I bring up that reporting, Ardoino brushes it off, calling the amounts highlighted in the piece “truly a drop in the ocean.” The “infinite, vast majority of the usage of USDT is by good people,” he says, adding that the company now works with almost 300 law enforcement agencies across more than 60 countries. “iPhones are sometimes used by bad people, Toyotas are used by bad people.”

But he goes even further, arguing that his company’s technology makes it superior to cash when it comes to monitoring illicit activity. “If there are cash pallets of hundreds of billions of dollars roaming around the world, U.S. law enforcement can hardly do anything about it,” he says. “But with USDT, we demonstrated that working with the DOJ, FBI, Secret Service and hundreds of other law enforcement agencies, we could quickly freeze the funds.”

In fact, according to Ardoino, Tether has frozen $3.5 billion in tokens, the vast majority of which belonged to “people who have been scammed or hacked.” In 2023, he says, for example, Tether proactively identified $225 million in a “pig-butchering scam” in the “blink of an eye” after traditional financial systems failed to catch it. (Pig-butchering scams involve scammers who befriend victims or even romance them over time before luring them into fake investments.)

“We have onboarded the FBI and the Secret Service. We follow OFAC [the office that enforces U.S. sanctions],” he tells me.

Whether critics are satisfied isn’t yet clear, but Tether has survived every attempt to bring it down. It’s an ongoing battle. Just three months ago, the S&P Global Ratings called USDT’s stability weak.

When I raise this point, Ardoino is dismissive. “If that is the same S&P that completely missed the subprimes, I’m proud they’re considering us weak.”

He then points to spring 2022, when another major stablecoin called TerraLuna abruptly collapsed, wiping out $40 billion in value virtually overnight. Panic spread across the stablecoin market, and hedge funds bet Tether would be next to fail. Customers rushed to pull their money out. “We redeemed $7 billion in 48 hours – 10% of our reserves. In 20 days, $20 billion – 25% of our reserves. There is no bank in the world that can survive that level of redemptions. We did it with flying colors.”

Ardoino also references a rival that didn’t fare as well during a separate bank run, though he stops short of naming it. The implication is clear — he means Circle. When Silicon Valley Bank collapsed in 2023, Circle’s USDC briefly lost its peg after revealing $3 billion in exposure. When I ask Ardoino directly about Circle — often portrayed as the cleaner alternative — his PR team quickly interjects. He manages only: “Sometimes you are painted in a different light if you don’t bend the knee to Wall Street.”

Ardoino emphasizes that Tether now has $30 billion in excess reserves beyond what’s needed to redeem all outstanding tokens. What’s more, those reserves are held at Cantor Fitzgerald — the Wall Street firm that Howard Lutnick led for over three decades before becoming U.S. Commerce Secretary a year ago. Lutnick has publicly vouched for Tether’s legitimacy; meanwhile the firm earns fees from managing Tether’s massive Treasury holdings, creating a financial interest that now exists alongside Lutnick’s role shaping America’s commerce policy.

Tether is now safer than traditional banks, is Ardoino’s point. “The banking system is doing fractional reserve at the length of 90%,” Ardoino says. “So if you deposit $1 million in a bank account, $100,000 is there, and $900,000 is lent out.” By contrast, he argued, “even if Bitcoin would go to zero, Tether would have more money than all the USDT tokens issued.”

All those reserves generate enormous profits. According to Fortune, Tether reported more than $15 billion in profit for 2025 derived largely from yield on reserves that — unlike with savings or checking accounts — it doesn’t share with USDT holders. When I ask whether Tether would reconsider sharing interest with its customers, Ardoino says that while interest makes sense for Americans who’ve come to expect it, it’s not top of mind for Tether’s core users, who are primarily trying to preserve value.

“The Turkish Lira lost 81% of its value against the U.S. dollar in the last five years. The Argentina peso lost 94.5%,” he says. For someone whose currency loses 3% daily, a 4% annual interest rate is meaningless. “While for the rest of the world, U.S. dollar stablecoins are the savings account, you cannot think about stablecoins for U.S. people as the savings account, but more like a checking account.”

There may be another reason Tether isn’t eager to share yields: pending legislation could make it illegal anyway. The CLARITY Act, currently moving through Congress, would prohibit stablecoin issuers from paying interest to holders, a move that banking groups support to prevent deposits from fleeing traditional banks. For Tether, its passage would simply codify its existing business model. For competitors like Circle, which have experimented with reward programs, it could eliminate a competitive tool.

Ardoino’s ambitions extend far beyond USDT. Tether Gold, a token backed by physical gold that launched in 2020, now has $2.6 billion in circulation, meaning customers hold tokens representing that much gold. But Tether’s total gold strategy is far more ambitious. According to Ardoino’s Bloomberg interview, the company holds around 140 tons of gold worth roughly $24 billion, making it one of the largest private gold holders in the world.

When I ask why Tether launched products like Tether Gold, he frames it as offering alternatives in an uncertain world. “Gold has been the first big, almost ubiquitous form of currency in humanity,” he says. “For the first time, with blockchain technology, we could actually make gold again a currency used not only as a store of value, but also a way to exchange value.”

When the gold product launched, “we were almost called crazy,” he recalls. Since then, Tether has been buying a whopping one to two tons per week, positioning itself as what Ardoino calls “one of the biggest gold central banks in the world.”

But it’s the company’s push into AI that hints at Ardoino’s even grander plans. Roughly nine months ago, Tether rolled out Qvac, Tether’s decentralized AI platform. The name comes from Isaac Asimov’s short story “The Last Question,” which Ardoino sees as the “most magnificent sci-fi piece of literature ever written.”

His pitch for Qvac echoes his pitch for USDT, which is to serve the underserved. “USDT never meant to go after people that had an account in JPMorgan,” he explains. “We went to all the people left behind by the traditional financial system.” Similarly, centralized AI platforms will miss billions of people who can’t afford subscriptions, he says.

“If they don’t have enough money for paying $150 per year for a bank account, they don’t have enough money to be onboarded on powerful AI platforms,” Ardoino says. Instead, Qvac will run locally on smartphones, as he believes within three to five years, today’s most powerful smartphones will be commonplace in Africa and South America, enabling up to 80% of AI use cases. “So USDT will empower the biggest decentralized AI platform in the world.”

It’s quite a vision, yet even Qvac is just another prong of a bigger strategy. According to Fortune, Tether has committed more than $1 billion to German AI robotics firm Neura, $775 million to social media platform Rumble, and hundreds of millions more to satellites, data centers, and agriculture. The magazine described Tether’s transformation into something resembling a sovereign wealth fund.

When I note that from the outside, these investments — including a stake in the Juventus soccer club — seem disconnected, Ardoino insists they are not. “The motto of Tether is to be the stable company,” he says. “The reason why we invest in land, cattle, agriculture, modern tech, in gold – the common denominator is ensuring that Tether can remain a cornerstone of the world that is our user.”

He describes it as an interlocking system where agriculture can be digitalized, gold markets revolutionized, telecommunications made peer-to-peer. “Our story is about building a company that can [stand] the test of time,” he says. “It’s becoming a social impact company that is changing the lives of hundreds of millions of people and providing them something they never had before – stability.”

And when I bring up political risks — what happens is the next U.S. administration views Tether as a threat, as did the last — Ardoino is ready for it.

“I hope that financial inclusion and bringing 536 million people on board onto the dollar is something that both Republicans and Democrats care about,” he says.  “It’s a matter of education.”

            <h2>What a Reality-TV Novel Understands About Reality</h2>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">There’s a saying on Survivor: “Perception is reality.” There’s a saying on TikTok: “Do it for the plot.”

Both maxims are about the stories people tell themselves. The first acknowledges that someone’s read of a situation will shape the outcome—even if they’re reading things wrong. The second declares that all of life is a story and you need to provide the drama.

The desire to treat life as a narrative—and then control that narrative—is the subject of Stephen Fishbach’s debut novel, Escape!, a literary thriller that follows a single season of a fictional reality survival show from casting to airtime. Fishbach writes from experience: He was a two-time contestant on Survivor and co-hosts a Survivor podcast. To inform his book, he interviewed many other reality contestants and crew members. The result marries the plot twists of a competition show with compassionate portraits of the people involved who are searching for identity and meaning. It’s both an examination of how the reality-TV sausage gets made and a reminder that people can sacrifice their humanity if they focus too much on making the plot—of a television program, of life itself—exciting.

Escape! joins many other stories inspired by reality television. The Lifetime show UnREAL, which was co-created by a former Bachelor producer, similarly offered an insider’s view of the underbelly of reality-TV production. Books such as Suzanne Collins’s The Hunger Games and Nana Kwame Adjei-Brenyah’s Chain-Gang All-Stars use reality TV as scaffolding for dystopias in which entertainment is used to numb a populace to injustice. Aisling Rawle’s 2025 book The Compound features a Big Brother–meets–dating show setup as a way to explore how materialist greed can impede connection. The drama alone of reality TV makes it a compelling subject for fiction. But the genre feels particularly relevant today, more than 25 years after the first season of Survivor aired, when anyone with a social-media account can perform a version of themselves on a small screen. Every Instagram or TikTok post presents questions of how to edit a life.

Fishbach’s novel stands out because it explores the complicated dynamics of self-narrativizing—and because it’s enriched by the behind-the-scenes details informed by his firsthand experience. The show in Escape! is not Survivor, but it rhymes: Both have an island-jungle setting, outdoor-obstacle-course competitions, alliances, and backstabbing. Both administer a personality test during casting and keep players’ medications in a box in the jungle out of sight of cameras. Contestants can tell when their fellow players are plotting, Fishbach writes, because the crew moves the boom mic closer to them. (Fishbach writes in an author’s note that though many plot points are inspired by true events, “nothing in this book should be taken to impugn” the staff of Survivor. And Survivor exists in the world of the novel, as if to emphasize that Fishbach isn’t really describing the show he was once on.) He’s a funny observer of some of the genre’s more ridiculous tropes. When the contestants compete for a food reward, he writes that they “rub their stomachs and pull O-faces at the idea of these soggy pastries, mirroring the reaction shots they’ve seen from other contestants on previous shows.” Although a couple of the producer characters veer into cartoonish villainy, for the most part Fishbach manages to critique reality TV while maintaining empathy for those who make it.

Driving the novel is each character’s relentless pursuit of a story arc that they hope will redeem, transform, or elevate them. All of Fishbach’s characters—Miriam, the timid young contestant who hopes the show will give her a life-changing revelation; Kent, the has-been reality star looking to recapture his former glory; Beck, the disgraced producer projecting her issues onto the cast; and a collection of other reality-show archetypes who populate the background—are laser-focused on The Edit. (The Edit is “shorthand for the story that a TV show tells about a character,” as Beck explains. “Our job is to simplify and clarify.”)

Fishbach surely knows a thing or two about how the narrative structure of reality TV flattens people. In his first appearance, on Survivor: Tocantins, he has said he was portrayed as “more heroic than I am,” while in his second season, Survivor: Cambodia, he was sometimes played for laughs. “During its airing, I felt a lot of shame every week wondering which of my moments would be edited for maximum comic effect,” he told Entertainment Weekly. In Escape!, Fishbach portrays The Edit as, at best, a necessary evil, and, at worst, a life-ruining malevolence. The players obsess over how the show will digest their actions, what kind of narrative it will spit out. Will they get a Loser Edit or a Hero Edit? When Kent approaches the island for the first time, for example, he is “already thinking about how he’ll describe it in his interviews.” The producers manipulate the players into embodying the characters they preordained during casting and pat themselves on the back for constructing such a good story. Beck is not above using a woman’s dead son to make her emotional enough to quit, or browbeating Miriam into killing a pig for the sake of her “growth arc.” Compelled to redo a shark hunt that the cameras missed the first time, one contestant gets seriously injured.

Even as the producers’ manipulations turn dangerous, Escape! is clear that the contestants are complicit co-creators of their simplified selves. Kent, Fishbach writes, is “not here for the cash, or the plotting and scheming, or the banter. He’s here to slip into the old costume, which has started to sag and tear. He’s here to be Kent Duvall.” The heroic character he was edited into during his first season feels more real to him than the miserable person he is in his actual life. He’s trying to return to a self that only ever existed on a screen. Miriam goes along with Beck’s heavy-handed suggestions that she, not Kent, should be the hero, in part because she thinks the show might transform her into a new, somehow truer version of herself.

Although most readers of Escape! will never find themselves competing on TV, the characters’ concerns are relatable. Humans can’t help but see life as a narrative. An innate part of our psychology is arranging memories, experiences, and desires into a coherent story. Psychologists say that these stories form our personalities, our very selves. Reality TV preys on this natural impulse and can warp it to dehumanizing extremes.

Fishbach captures how reality TV takes the internal process of turning your life into a story, and makes it external. Who hasn’t replayed a moment in their mind, imagining what they could have done differently, what they should have said? The contestants on Escape! really do relive the same moment over and over with slight variations, as the camera operators insist on take after take. They get feedback from producers in real time on whether they’re living up to the role they’re supposed to play. It’s intoxicating: “On the show, every morsel of food he ate, how long he slept, every passing whim or frustration, mattered urgently to the producers,” Kent thinks. “It was how life should be, all the purposefulness of a religion, that the trivial opinions and feuds of your tiny existence mattered in the eyes of God.”

Reality television isn’t the only place where people can elevate their tiny existence into a grand narrative. Social media has long encouraged users to present their lives as easily legible stories—a mindset that seems to have intensified in recent years. During the height of the pandemic, posters diagnosed themselves and others with “main-character syndrome,” which, depending on whom you ask, is either a form of extreme narcissism or a way of empowering yourself by pretending you’re the star of a movie. The internet serves up a buffet of character types that people can strive to become or avoid becoming: clean girl, tradwife, Pilates princess, performative male, Chad. And if you’re wondering if you should do something ill-advised, such as text your ex, posters may cheekily encourage you to “do it for the plot.”

The sheer volume of stories people are exposed to in modern life can drown out the ability to hear one’s own true voice. At one point in Escape!, Beck wonders whether her work of unearthing contestants’ stories has any meaning, when so many meanings are imposed on everyone from the outside: “Maybe the very idea of depths, of an ‘authentic self,’ was merely another story, buried under layers of stories,” Fishbach writes. “We were all palimpsests of platitudes.”

Yet the book doesn’t give in to that despair. Toward the end of the novel, Kent remembers a touching moment with fellow contestants from his first TV appearance. He realizes he forgot it for years because it didn’t make the show’s final cut. When you edit down the mess of life, something is always deleted. But perhaps, Fishbach suggests, it’s not lost forever.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">At some point over the past 15 years, kids stopped reading. Or at least their teachers stopped asking them to read the way they once did. We live in the age of the reel, the story, the sample, the clip. The age of the excerpt. And even in old-fashioned literature classes, assignments have been abbreviated so dramatically that high-school English teachers are, according to one recent survey, assigning fewer than three books a year.

I’ve seen the effects of this change up close, having taught English in college classrooms since 2007, and I’ve witnessed the slow erosion of attention firsthand, too: students on computers in the back of lecture halls, then on phones throughout the classroom, then outsourcing their education to artificial intelligence. We know that tech companies supply the means of distraction. But somehow the blame falls on the young reader. Whole novels aren’t possible to teach, we are told, because students won’t (or can’t) read them. So why assign them?

When I walked into my American-literature class at Case Western Reserve University last fall, I looked at 32 college students, mostly science majors, and expected an uphill battle. As my colleague Rose Horowitch has reported, “Many students no longer arrive at college—even at highly selective, elite colleges—prepared to read books.” One-third of the high-school seniors tested in 2024 were found not to have basic reading skills.

Yet by the end of the semester, as we read the last sentence of Toni Morrison’s Song of Solomon, I regretted ever doubting my students. I am now convinced that I was wrong to listen to the ostensible wisdom of the day—and that teachers of literature are wrong to give up assigning the books we loved ourselves. There may be plenty of good reasons to despair over the present. The literature classroom should not be one of them.

The image of a college literature class hasn’t changed much in the past 50 years. A group of students are sitting around a table, or maybe they’re perched in a lecture hall, looking down at a passage by Melville, reading a sentence out loud, puzzling over a metaphor, feeling the jolt of possibility that comes when their world is reimagined in startling language. My most vivid memory of reading an entire novel in college was picking up Virginia Woolf’s To the Lighthouse. On an unseasonably warm spring night in 2002, I propped myself against the steps of the library, opened the book, and stayed there until the early morning.

Idrees Kahloon: America is sliding toward illiteracy

I’ve taught for nearly two decades, but last fall I was worried in a way I’d never been before. I’ve always assigned long, challenging books. I regularly teach To the Lighthouse to first-year students, sometimes swapping it out for James Joyce’s Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man or Mulk Raj Anand’s Untouchable. But anecdotes and statistics about the decline of reading unsettled me. Plus, I was worried about my own raddled attention span, and I was unnerved by the apparent inevitability of AI-generated essays.

My course, a survey of American literature from 1660 to the present, felt like a dare: 400 years of literature in a single semester. And yet my fears that students might refuse to read helped clarify my approach. Instead of hopscotching from one excerpt to the next, I’d create small eddies in time. We’d spend several days, sometimes a couple of weeks, on a single author. We’d read nonfiction and novels—Harriet Jacobs’s Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl, Faulkner’s As I Lay Dying, Willa Cather’s My Ántonia—and long poems. I couldn’t be comprehensive; the course’s remit was, essentially, Puritans to the present. I was, instead, serious about reading whole books (and sermons: It’s impossible not to include Jonathan Edwards’s “Sinners in the Hands of an Angry God” if you’re seeking to understand early American literature). I would teach the students what I was starting to miss myself: tarrying with an author beyond his best-known works, developing a relationship with a novelist across wildly different novels.

Two things became clear in the early weeks of class. First, the students were reading. They were reading everything, or most of it. I know this because I had them identify obscure passages, without notes, devices, or books at hand. Second, they were experiencing life in a way that was not easy outside the class and its assignments. They were expected—required—to give huge chunks of time to an activity, reading, that was not monetizing their attention in real time. They had, in effect, taken back their lives, for an hour or two each day. It turned out that American literature, which so often flirts with utopian fantasies of regaining control—hello, Walden!—could do precisely that.

To give the students time to read, I had to change the way they wrote. I axed the take-home essays I’d assigned before—this wasn’t a “writing” class, anyway—and assigned what I suspected were far more difficult in-class, timed “flash essays,” with prompts I gave the same day. No trudging back from the library with 10 pages on Woolf in the special season of Cleveland weather we call “stupid cold.” Long, research-based essay assignments had always worked well for the top students in the class, the ones who were already trained to write. But I’ve rarely seen, over the course of my career, the kind of development I hoped for in the majority of students whom I asked to write that way.

I was also thinking of the writing I myself had been doing lately, smooshed within the hour I had for lunch, or pounded out on the couch after toddler bedtime. I wanted my students to have a taste of the adrenaline and, yes, stress that came from writing when faced with real time constraints. I wanted edge-of-the-seat writing that opened itself up to failure. They would confront their fear without guardrails, without bumpers, without AI-drafted support, without a plan or even a thesis. One student came up to me after the first flash essay, a little frustrated and worried that he wasn’t meeting the mark. He felt like he was writing into the complete unknown, rather than with a plan in mind. I said that was exactly the point.

In a haunting sentence from Austerlitz, by the German novelist W. G. Sebald, the titular character describes losing control of his language. Once a fluent and successful writer, Austerlitz suddenly falls into a crisis of faith about the sentence, which becomes “at best a makeshift expedient, a kind of unhealthy growth issuing from our ignorance, something which we use, in the same way as many sea plants and animals use their tentacles, to grope blindly through the darkness enveloping us.” I liked the metaphor of writing into the darkness. So I devised simple essay topics that asked students to write about their own difficulties as readers. One was: “Write about a moment in an Emily Dickinson poem that you don’t understand.” Another was: “Write about your morning routine, but in the style of Faulkner.” I didn’t want to create 32 new Faulkners. I wanted the students to experience the moment when their own style broke through the imitation, when the attempt to write like Faulkner failed and revealed, as a kind of photonegative, their own emergent voices. John Keats called this state of being “negative capability,” a condition in which the writer leans to live in a perpetual state of uncertainty. If it was really true that the students couldn’t read, then it was up to me to put the books in their way and make them deal with them.

Adults underestimate the power of simply telling a young person to read a book and vouching for it ourselves. A teacher gave me Leo Tolstoy and Victor Hugo when I was far too young. I loved to read already, but at that age (13), my diet had been Star Trek novelizations, Michael Crichton, and—thanks to a dull sick day browsing my parents’ shelves—The Bonfire of the Vanities. In early high school, I read War and Peace and Les Misèrables and was absolutely mystified by the density of detail. I was frequently bored—all those pages on the sewer system of Paris—and then suddenly moved to tears by a character like Eponine, who “smiled a little, and died” in the arms of Marius. I was just too immature for other novels: Emma Bovary’s desire and Charles Swann’s jealousy mystified me, because I would not ask anyone out for at least another five years. Inundating myself with thousand-page novels set in the early 19th century, I had nearly every experience one has while reading, and I had them all at once. I came as close to overdosing on Russian mood swings as I could. But by the time I reached the end of high school, I developed a tolerance for what I did not understand, and then I gradually understood it. Once I did begin to understand, I felt an extraordinary desire to repeat the experience. Reading this much made books feel like a “doorway” for me, as George Saunders has called it.

I saw something like this happen in my American-literature class. First impressions, in literature as in life, are unreliable. When we started Walden, plenty of students were turned off by Thoreau’s long-winded musings on the real-estate market in New England. Two classes later, Thoreau was a friend for life. His timeless needling felt timely: “We know not where we are. Beside, we are sound asleep half our life.” Despite his flight to the woods, Thoreau was more easily distracted than any of us—by birdsong, by a train whistle, by the sound of ice cracking. He could barely sustain a single thought without jumping to an unrelated idea. Walden is a book that freely indulges in distraction—not to dull our senses, but to keep ourselves awake, curious, delighted, enraged. Thoreau’s world sends us constant notifications, and by doing so, asks us to reject the “vain reality” where we have been “shipwrecked.”

From the November 2024 issue: The elite college students who can’t read books

The iterative process of confusion, endurance, and incremental understanding is what literature professors teach when they assign whole books. This march toward understanding doesn’t have a great name other than reading. We need to help students grow into the difficulty of reading. The best way to do that is not to “meet them where they are,” a bromide that has become doctrine for higher education. We have to do as Whitman says instead: Stop somewhere ahead and wait for them to catch up.

None of this is to say that higher education faces no challenges in this moment. Universities’ resources are severely constrained; their research missions have been hobbled. In many institutions, academic freedom has been threatened or abrogated. These are bleak conditions, possibly terminal ones for the post–World War II dream of a research university. I agree with those who argue that universities find themselves in a state of crisis. But narratives about the “end of reading” strike me as self-inflicted, the manifestation of a collective depression. (In other words, to borrow from Thoreau, “We know not where we are.”) If we want students to keep reading books, faculty have the most important role to play—regardless of whatever new devices or platforms emerge to capture students’ attention. The reaction to declining reading skills, poor comprehension, and fragmented attention spans should not be to negotiate or compromise, but to double down on the cure.

Defenses of the humanities largely get things right. Books teach you empathy because you imagine other lives. Poems refresh our conventional words—what Wallace Stevens derided as the “rotted names”—by investing language with power and nuance. I’m partial to the way the poet Adrienne Rich put it while teaching in the tuition-free City College of New York system: “What interests me in teaching is less the emergence of the occasional genius than the overall finding of language by those who did not have it and by those who have been used and abused to the extent that they lacked it.” Literature helps you express your own thoughts in vivid language, partly by imitating the writers who do it well. If you’re not inclined toward the ethical view, or Rich’s vision of social transformation, books might provide escape routes instead, invitations to leisure or to what my colleague Adam Kirsch has called “vice.”

But the whole notion of having to defend literature or the humanities in the first place may have us wrong-footed. It’s not only what you learn from reading Moby-Dick—notwithstanding Melville’s extensive knowledge of 19th-century whaling—but what you are doing when you are reading Moby-Dick. You are neither learning a transferable skill nor escaping from the world’s demands that you do. You are not word-maxxing or optimizing information for efficiency. You are engaged in a singular practice, one with its own primary justification.

The students I taught last semester turned enthusiastically to Faulkner and spent their time reading about the journey of the Bundren family to bury their mother’s body. Why did they do this? Because I asked them to, and told them it was worth it. I said that time was precious, and that we needed to take some of it back for ourselves. So we did.</div>

            <h2>The Father-Daughter Divide</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-02-02</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/family/2026/02/father-daughter-divide/684466/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Growing up, Melissa Shultz sometimes felt like she had two fathers. One version of her dad, she told me, was playful and quick to laugh. He was a compelling storyteller who helped shape her career as a writer, and he gave great bear hugs. He often bought her small gifts: a pink “princess” phone when she was a teen, toys for her sons when she became a mom. Some of their most intimate moments came when she cut his hair; it was, she said, “a way to be close without talking.” He was there for her in hard times, too. When her engagement ended, he helped pack her things and drove her home.

But she told me their relationship could also be turbulent. The other version of her father was “dark” and would “get so angry” that he seemed to lose control. He would freeze her out for months at a time if she challenged him. He’d call her names, even in front of her own kids. He died when she was in her 30s, and she grieved intensely, though she doubted whether they ever fully understood each other. Now in her 60s, Shultz told me she still mourns the relationship.

Shultz’s story may sound familiar to some other fathers and daughters. In the 1990s, the journalist Victoria Secunda wrote in her book Women and Their Fathers that “enriching attachments” between dads and daughters were “astonishingly rare.” Secunda had interviewed 150 daughters and 75 dads and found that most of the relationships they described were marked by “too much distance.” Two decades later, the psychologist Peggy Drexler wrote in her 2011 book Our Fathers, Ourselves, which drew on interviews with dozens of women, that daughters were prone to using the refrain “I love my dad, but …”

Evidence of a dad-daughter divide crops up in more recent research on families, too. Fathers and daughters are more likely to become estranged than other pairs within the nuclear family. According to a 2022 study of national longitudinal data, roughly 28 percent of women in the U.S. are estranged from their dad; that’s only slightly higher than the 24 percent of sons estranged from their father but significantly higher than the 6.3 percent of children of any gender estranged from their mother. Even in cases where contact isn’t completely cut off, father-daughter relationships tend to be less close than other familial bonds. In a 2010 study, adult daughters reported feeling less comfortable discussing personal issues with their father than they did with their mother, and relying on their dad for “instrumental support” rather than emotional care. Linda Nielsen, a professor at Wake Forest University who has studied father-daughter relationships for much of her career and written five books on the topic, has called it the weakest parent-child relationship. Of course, plenty of women have a close and loving relationship with their father. But the research is clear: Many do not.

This tension hurts both fathers and daughters. Women’s bond with their dad may be linked to the quality of their mental health and romantic relationships, Nielsen wrote in Father-Daughter Relationships. And, as one 2023 study shows, parents (and especially fathers) who were in regular contact with their adult kids were, on average, more satisfied with their lives. Dads and daughters who grow apart speak of immense pain. Each craves closeness, but neither side seems sure how to get there.

At the root of the modern father-daughter divide seems to be a mismatch in expectations. Fathers, generally speaking, have for generations been less involved than mothers in their kids’ (and especially their daughters’) lives. But lots of children today expect more: more emotional support and more egalitarian treatment. Many fathers, though, appear to have struggled to adjust to their daughters’ expectations. The result isn’t a relationship that has suddenly ruptured so much as one that has failed to fully adapt.

While reporting this article, I spoke with a dozen college-educated women, most of whom told me that their bond with their father lacked depth: Their conversations stayed superficial and could feel awkward, and their dad hardly ever showed vulnerability. Several said they feared their father’s anger. Others told me they rarely hugged. Few regularly had one-on-one time with their dad.

According to some researchers, that lack of quality time together—particularly in childhood—is an acute factor straining father-daughter bonds. “Parenting time is closely related to the quality of your relationship with that parent,” Nielsen told me, and lots of fathers and daughters just don’t get enough of it. Women with kids younger than 6 spend, on average, about an hour more each day caring for their children than men do, according to the 2024 American Time Use Survey. And when dads do care for their kids, they have traditionally been found to devote more time to their boys: One 2012 study that looked at kids ages 8 and up found that in brother-sister pairs, sons spent more time with their dad than daughters did.

As kids reach high school, the discrepancy in how much time dads spend with their sons versus their daughters balloons. The 2012 study found that by age 17, girls were averaging less than 30 minutes a week one-on-one with their dad, while boys got more than an hour; fathers and teen daughters hung out less than any other familial combination. Part of the time gap seems to stem from the fact that teen boys tend to want to spend more time with their dad, and teen girls largely gravitate toward their mom. But Will Glennon, a writer who interviewed hundreds of fathers for his 1995 book, Fathering, told me that many dads also distance themselves from their adolescent daughters. Most of the fathers he spoke with were uncomfortable watching their girls go through puberty. That stage felt volatile, and the dads had “no idea” what their daughters were dealing with—so they withdrew. This was a reaction that Glennon said he understood: He’d also struggled when his daughter was a teen.

For the nearly one-third of American children whose parents divorce, the time deficit can be especially profound. Only a third of those separations result in equal joint custody, and mothers are more likely to become the primary caregiver. Partly for this reason, 21 percent of U.S. children don’t live with their biological father, according to the Census Bureau. Of course, parental separation touches sons, too, but it can be particularly ruinous for father-daughter relationships. One 20-year study measured the quality of relationships between fathers and their adult children post-divorce and found that three times more daughters than sons felt that the bond had significantly deteriorated. Candace McCullough, a family therapist in Maryland, told me that in her practice, divorce and affairs are among the most serious factors harming father-daughter relationships.

For much of history, until women married they largely relied on their father for material support. The bond between them tended to be based on a sense of mutual duty, and daughters were expected to be deferential. That changed over the course of the 20th century. As more women attained higher education and achieved financial independence, the traditional basis for father-daughter relationships eroded.

Today, children generally desire more closeness with both of their parents well into adulthood. But while many moms are prepared to provide the intimacy their children crave, the shake-up has caught lots of fathers off guard, Joshua Coleman, a psychologist specializing in family relationships, told me. He said that, based on his clinical experience, many fathers are ill-equipped to meet their kids’—and especially their daughters’—needs. “What generates closeness is another person’s vulnerability,” Coleman explained, and dads may not be ready for that. Niobe Way, an NYU professor who has extensively researched men and boys, told me that the disconnect may be rooted partly in how many modern fathers were brought up “in a context that was just so repressive” and “hypermasculine.” Daughters, she said, are generally “more free to express their feelings.”

Nearly all of the women I interviewed described a painful discordance with their dad. (Most asked to be identified by their first name only, to speak candidly about the relationship.) “I’m just like, ‘Show your emotions,’” Claire, a 43-year-old educator living in France, told me. Her mother died by suicide 20 years ago, she said, and she longs to talk about her with her father. She wonders whether he thinks about her mom. “I’ve never asked him,” she said. And he hasn’t asked her, either. Louise, a former doctor in her 40s living in England, also rarely sees her dad engage emotionally. He’ll “shut things down” if she tries to discuss his personal life. Min, a 29-year-old who grew up in South Korea but now lives in London, also told me that her dad rarely asks about her life; she’s unsure if he even knows how old she is or where she works. He instead focuses on supporting her with practical matters, such as whether she needs help transporting her luggage for a trip or whether she’s eaten. “He’s quite patriarchal; he’s very male-orientated,” she said, which she attributes in part to South Korean culture. She told me that their differences can lead to “cultural clashes”—a feeling many immigrant daughters may relate to.

Glennon told me that the dads he spoke with also felt disconnected from their adult daughters. He believes women cope with the lack of depth by brushing their father off—saying, “No, I can’t talk, I’ve got things to do.” That can leave dads confused and hurt, fueling the cycle.

For Nielsen, dad-daughter tension has an obvious solution: more quality time together. She acknowledged that communication styles can differ by gender, but she emphasized that, regardless of those differences, the more attention fathers and daughters devote to each other, the better the bond tends to be.

More fathers do seem to be changing their lifestyle to make time for their kids, daughters included. Modern dads, on average, do three times more child care than fathers in 1965 did. Some are fighting for better joint-custody laws. A growing number are forgoing paid work to stay at home. Nielsen told me that men are no less instinctively nurturing or empathetic than women; many lament the time they spend away from their kids.

Several of the daughters I spoke with were also carving out time for their father. They told me about planning annual daughter-dad road trips and going to counseling together. Shadi Shahnavaz, who has led several fathers and adult daughters in joint therapy sessions, told me that, in her experience, theirs are some of the quickest relationships to remedy.

Even between daughters and fathers whose dynamic has become intensely strained, Nielsen has argued that relationships can—and do—recover. For Melissa Shultz, healing came posthumously. In the decades since her father’s death, her anger toward him has softened. She still mourns what she “never had,” she told me, but she has come to empathize with him. “He had a lot of pain as a child, with his parents.”

For Joshua Coleman, who spent years estranged from his adult daughter, reconciliation came sooner. To rebuild trust, he told me, he learned to stop defending himself; he came to understand that demanding that his daughter respect his authority only drove her away. He saw a need to become more egalitarian and “soft.” When she was open to seeing him again, he let her set the pace. Slowly, he says, they found their way, not just to civility, but to something rarer: genuine closeness.

            <h2>Pete Hegseth Delights in Violence</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-02-02</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/national-security/2026/02/hegseth-trump-minnesota-ice-military/685848/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Even before Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem had declared Alex Pretti a domestic terrorist, Pete Hegseth was online trashing his home state. Hegseth, who grew up north of Minneapolis, took to social media in the hours after masked immigration agents shot the ICU nurse with a stark calculation: “ICE > MN.”

“We have your back 100%. You are SAVING the country,” the Pentagon chief told immigration agents in an X post. “Shame on the leadership of Minnesota—and the lunatics in the street.” Hegseth didn’t define the we. He and fellow Cabinet members? The 1.3 million service members he commands? The troops he put on standby for potential deployment to Minneapolis? He hasn’t said. But if there was any doubt about how Hegseth would wield military might if troops were sent to check unrest or dissent in U.S. cities, there’s your answer.

Hegseth, who served in Iraq and Afghanistan as a National Guardsman before becoming a Fox News weekend host, has repeatedly blamed “woke” and “weak” military leaders for imposing overly restrictive rules of engagement that, he believes, cost U.S. lives and prolonged America’s “forever” wars. Since taking office, Hegseth has been an ardent supporter of Donald Trump’s expanded use of troops in U.S. cities and his aggressive immigration operations. When federal immigration agents surged into Minneapolis, Hegseth put troops on prepare-to-deploy orders in North Carolina and Alaska. Trump has also threatened to invoke the Insurrection Act, which would allow troops to conduct law-enforcement activities.

In standing with ICE’s hard-line tactics against the citizens of Minnesota, Hegseth not only overstepped his jurisdiction as secretary of defense (he prefers to be called the “secretary of war”); he gave a glimpse of the belligerent approach he might take were those troops to be opposed by citizen protesters such as Pretti and Renee Good. It is one thing to defend your troops as they face enemies abroad. It is quite another to suggest that troops—or other armed government forces—have a free hand to do whatever they want on America’s streets to American citizens.

Asked about Hegseth’s comments, Pentagon Press Secretary Kingsley Wilson said in an emailed statement that the secretary’s mission was to execute Trump’s orders and protect the United States: “We will do everything in our power to stop those who seek to harm Americans and the brave men and women defending our homeland.”

I’ve covered every secretary of defense since Bob Gates, who served George W. Bush and Barack Obama. No Pentagon chief then or since has embraced the jocular yet intimidating rhetoric that Hegseth has employed about the military’s use of violence. At times, uniformed leaders have spouted off in public. Jim Mattis, the retired Marine general whom Trump referred to as “Mad Dog,” made tough-guy quips about how “it’s fun to shoot some people” and the need to “have a plan to kill everyone you meet.” But Mattis turned out to be a check on—rather than an accelerant of—Trump’s most disruptive instincts. Pentagon leaders have almost always publicly couched the military’s use of violence in decorous euphemisms designed to show the solemnity of lethality. Insurgents are “eliminated” or “taken off the battlefield.” Public gloating, in an institution as storied and upright as the U.S. military, is viewed as unseemly.

Not so for Hegseth. His tone and vocabulary regarding the use of force is gleeful, juvenile, and crude. He has posted doctored children’s-book covers that show a turtle named Franklin hanging out of a helicopter, shooting at drug boats. He embraced a phrase that the White House is now touting as Trump’s doctrine for the use of force: fuck around and find out. And he has celebrated lethal strikes on suspected drug traffickers in small boats in the Caribbean and eastern Pacific. After the initial strike in September, he told reporters, “I’d say we smoked a drug boat and there’s 11 narco-terrorists at the bottom of the ocean—and when other people try to do that, they’re gonna meet the same fate.” In November, hours after The Washington Post reported that commanders had killed two survivors of that strike, Hegseth posted, “We have only just begun to kill narco-terrorists.” Hegseth has denied any wrongdoing by the military and has not announced any internal investigations or reviews.

Trump’s adviser Stephen Miller and the president himself employ similar cruelty when discussing what they see as America’s urban pathologies (Trump has described an “invasion from within” and said U.S. cities should be used as “training grounds” for the military). But it’s unusual, to say the least, for someone who sits in the top office at the Pentagon, a department focused on conflict outside the U.S. In theory, Hegseth is supposed to be setting an example for the world’s most powerful military, responsible for a large nuclear arsenal and the life-and-death decisions of a massive global force.

Hegseth’s regular demonization of domestic opponents (the “lunatics” he referred to are the same American citizens the military is duty bound to protect) also gives a glimpse into how he would view the power dynamic were troops to be deployed domestically. (In contrast to Hegseth’s swagger, when Minnesota state leaders deployed the National Guard to assist local law enforcement this week, Guardsmen handed out coffee and doughnuts.)

Peter Feaver, an expert on civil-military relations at Duke University, told me that the top Pentagon officials responsible for the nation’s sons and daughters in service, and the weighty matters of war and peace, generally have tried to stay out of public political squabbles as much as possible. Hegseth, instead, “has adopted a messaging posture that breaks with that tradition, perhaps reflecting his own background as a partisan commentator on Fox News and thus his comfort with the hot takes and rapid-response mentality of that medium,” Feaver said. “Having the secretary be so prominent in partisan sparring can put pressure on the nonpartisan military, whose professional ethic requires them to stay out of the fray.”

Staying out of the fray is exactly what U.S. troops—National Guard and a small contingent of active-duty Marines—have done over the past year as the president and his allies deployed them to assist federal agents, fight crime, or respond to unrest in cities including Los Angeles, Memphis, and the nation’s capital. Military experts say that’s because military personnel have more extensive training and better discipline than ICE or Border Patrol agents.

But Hegseth’s firing of the top Army, Navy, and Air Force lawyers suggests a different potential problem in any further domestic deployments, Mark Cancian, a retired Marine colonel who is now at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, told me. Hegseth, who, before taking office, advocated for the lenient treatment of troops convicted of war crimes, might simply override the military-justice system if any violence occurs. “There’s always somebody who acts inappropriately, even criminally, in a moment of stress or frustration and needs to be held accountable,” Cancian said. “That will be a test.”

Hegseth’s attitude is rooted in his disillusionment and disappointment over his experience in Iraq, people who know him say. In his 2024 book, The War on Warriors, Hegseth boasted about instructing members of the platoon he led to disregard their rules of engagement, a shocking admission and one that now looks especially ominous should the Trump administration deploy troops in new ways within the United States.

Hegseth described his time in the 101st Airborne’s 3rd Brigade Combat Team—the camaraderie, stress, and euphoria of combat—as transformational. He emulated then-Colonel Michael Steele, a Black Hawk Down veteran and brigade commander who he felt was wrongly held responsible for attacks on civilians that occurred under his watch, one of the people who know Hegseth told me.

Those rules of engagement are handed down from commanders who are advised by military lawyers, called judge advocates general. Their aim is to ensure that operations comply with U.S and international law.

Hegseth has dismissed JAGs as “jagoffs” and complained that their decisions led to U.S. troops “fighting with one hand behind our back” in Iraq and Afghanistan. “When you send Americans to war, their mandate should be to lethally dominate the battlefield,” he wrote. “Our enemies should get bullets, not attorneys.”

Hegseth’s approach at the Pentagon has reflected those convictions. Since taking over a year ago, Hegseth has fired top generals and flag officers and vowed to empower the trigger-pullers. Speaking to senior uniformed leaders he summoned to a Marine base in Virginia last fall, Hegseth said the military would fight wars to win, not to defend, and  would end “stupid” restrictions on the use of force. “We untie the hands of our warfighters to intimidate, demoralize, hunt, and kill the enemies of our country,” he told hundreds of officers. “No more politically correct and overbearing rules of engagement; just common sense, maximum lethality, and authority for warfighters.”

Hegseth has company among some other veterans of the post-9/11 wars in believing that restrictive rules of engagement led to the U.S. failures in Iraq and Afghanistan, because troops were prevented from killing more insurgents, Jason Dempsey, a former Army officer who served two years in Afghanistan, told me. Dempsey described Hegseth’s attitude this way: “There should be no standards on the battlefield because it’s all us versus them, black versus white, good versus evil, and there are no innocent or undecided people in between.”

The importance of projecting strength and toughness is a deeply held belief for Hegseth, one of the people who know him told me. At the same time, Hegseth takes his cues from Trump, whose support is key to him keeping his role. In recent days, the president has distanced himself from his subordinates’ hot-blooded response to Pretti’s death, and his “border czar” has promised to wind down the federal immigration surge in Minnesota. In this case, Hegseth may be out of step with what his boss now wants.</div>

            <h2>A Hidden Lesson of the Minnesota Welfare Scandal</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-02-02</strong></p>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">At the federal level and on down, American government has come to rely heavily on nonprofits to deliver public services. This dependence is in many ways understandable, but it comes with serious risks. Feeding our Future, the Minnesota nonprofit whose employees were caught billing for services they didn’t provide, was not the first instance of an NGO stealing from taxpayers, nor will it be the last.

NGOs—private nonprofits that receive government funding—theoretically offer a nimble, targeted way to put policy into effect. Progressives like their grassroots nature; conservatives like that they might offer something closer to private-sector efficiency. Some NGOs perform admirably. Many others don’t, and evidence is scant that this system overall delivers services better than the government. Despite this record, in the past several decades, NGOs have become not so much a policy instrument under democratic control as a sprawling, semiautonomous administrative system with little accountability.

James Surowiecki: Welfare fraud is a problem—for Democrats

NGOs emerged as an alternative to direct government services during the latter decades of the 20th century. The first growth spurt came in the 1960s. President Lyndon B. Johnson’s War on Poverty saw NGOs as a means of fusing big-government spending with localistic sensibilities. According to the then-influential philosophy of “community action,” top-down solutions to social problems ran the unacceptable risk of race- and class-based discrimination. What’s more, adherents believed, if the government truly wanted to address poverty’s root causes, the poor needed to be involved in leading and running organizations meant to help them.

From the outset, this system was flawed. The Community Action Program sent federal funds to organizations and gave them broad leeway to determine how best to use those funds. The program foundered on spectacular failures, which were chronicled in works such as Daniel Patrick Moynihan’s Maximum Feasible Misunderstanding (1969) and Tom Wolfe’s “Mau-Mauing the Flak Catchers” (1970). Poverty pimp entered the vernacular as shorthand for a nonprofit leader who became expert at accessing federal money while deflecting oversight demands as anti-poor.

The “social-service industrial complex,” as this model came to be pejoratively known, proved somewhat more useful in reforming existing social services than launching new ones. Public mental-health and housing programs, run by state governments and local housing authorities, respectively, predated the War on Poverty. In both, centralized government bureaucracies were responsible for the lives of hundreds of thousands of vulnerable Americans. Both also boasted poor outcomes; public housing perpetuated intergenerational poverty, and many patients confined to mental asylums for years seemed worse than when they had been committed. Over time, more than 90 percent of public psychiatric-hospital beds in the United States were cut, and resources shifted to community-based mental-health programs, many of which were operated by private NGOs. At the local level, nonprofit affordable-housing developments became standard as cities across the nation demolished their public-housing projects.

Both of these changes fell short of expectations, however. Deinstitutionalizing the mentally ill left many of them homeless or incarcerated. And many of their family members or caregivers have said that the community-based mental-health system is too fragmented, making it hard to navigate. As for housing, few people outside socialist circles want to bring the projects back. But affordability concerns are now more acute than ever. And communities with high concentrations of modern forms of affordable housing still struggle with poverty and dependency.

Support for the NGO model became bipartisan during the “reinventing government” era of the 1990s. Republican governors as well as the Clinton administration urged public systems to seek inspiration from private industry. Although privatization (also sometimes called “not-for-profitization”) had several applications, the most famous was public charter schools. Much as with asylums and housing, urban school districts faced criticism for their dismal outcomes and top-heavy organization. Reformers proposed schools that would be taxpayer funded but run by independent organizations, typically nonprofits, and that would be academically accountable, up to and including facing closure. The idea proved wildly popular and led to many excellent new schools. But the promised accountability remained elusive; closing underperforming charters proved easier said than done.

Conservative-led welfare- and pension-reform initiatives helped fuel the expansion of NGOs in government. The 1996 Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Act imposed time limits and work requirements on cash welfare; it also made block-grant funds available to states for work-promoting activities such as job training and counseling. Cash handouts don’t require NGOs, but delivering these employment services did. As the political scientist Steven Rathgeb Smith has pointed out, the 1996 law actually made the NGO workforce larger.

In the years immediately following the Great Recession, most states passed legislation reforming their pension systems. Conservative analysts convinced officials that trimming public workers’ payouts would help avoid catastrophes such as bankruptcy, which befell several cities at the time. Another solution to the pension crisis was simply to rely more on workers who were ineligible for pensions in the first place and, therefore, were cheaper to hire—namely NGO employees. Two priorities of city progressives in the 2010s were expanding homeless services and developing alternatives to incarceration. According to public financial filings, some New York–based NGOs in those sectors have, this century, seen their workforces grow by 500 percent or more. During that same period, New York City’s municipal workforce has grown only 12 percent. New York City’s new mayor, Zohran Mamdani, says he will prioritize subsidizing child care and reducing the role of for-profit landlords in the housing market. Both will likely mean new or expanded lines of business for the NGO sector.

As this model expands at every level of government, it carries serious downsides, beginning with a lack of accountability. Because they are private entities, NGOs aren’t subject to public-records requests. Their leaders are neither elected nor appointed by an elected official, and their head counts don’t show up in municipal-workforce numbers, meaning that using NGOs to enact policy conceals the government’s true size. In public administration, lack of transparency can sometimes be justified. But it always comes at a cost.

When public services are administered at arm’s length from duly constituted public authorities, organizations like Feeding Our Future can better obscure corruption. A June 2024 report published by the Minnesota Office of the Legislative Auditor argued that “inadequate oversight” by state government abetted the fraud. Prosecutors claimed that although state agencies held ultimate power, Feeding Our Future intimidated them by wielding “accusations of racism.” More than 50 individuals have been convicted; $250 million was stolen. Minnesota Governor Tim Walz last month ended his 2026 reelection campaign, and possibly his nearly two-decade political career, because of the scandal.

Instances of outright criminality can distract from NGOs’ subtler corruption issues. NGO CEOs earn salaries that exceed those enjoyed by public-agency heads and even mayors or governors. They are not subject to term limits. Their titles confer status in certain circles. Government officials who yearn for those kinds of jobs might, in turn, be incentivized to avoid making enemies with the nonprofits whose work they are supposed to monitor. Clean-government advocates harp on the unseemliness of public officials overseeing industries that they hope to work in someday. The criticism is valid whether the industry in question is banking or mental-health services.

Ezekiel J. Emanuel: The great big Medicare rip-off

Conservatives who encourage the outsourcing of government work to NGOs should be wary for ideological reasons. When more progressives get elected, budgets grow, and so do NGO revenues and personnel. NGO workforces tilt leftward, meaning the government sometimes ends up putting public services in the hands of people with a distinct political agenda. For example, some progressive have turned to NGOs that encourage decarceration or push for social workers to handle certain law-enforcement tasks. Those kinds of investments can shift resources away from correctional and police officers, who are more expensive because of their union-protected health and retirement benefits. Governments might end up hiring more politically progressive NGO employees while reducing head counts of more politically conservative law-enforcement employees.

The conflicts of interests and lack of transparency that attend NGO governance can be justified if they are outweighed by the benefits. But as government dependence on NGOs has grown over the decades, it’s been hard to see how contracting out government functions has cut costs or made service delivery more effective. At this point, NGOs might be too entrenched in federal, state, and local governments for Americans to roll back their influence. NGOs are used in countless policy contexts, and they still enjoy bipartisan support. Even if the model cannot be replaced, we should aspire to a better version of it. Reformers should focus on systematic, careful oversight. Every so often, public officials should consider yanking contracts, if for no other reason than to reestablish their authority. After all, they’re the ones we voted for.</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Hundreds of billions of dollars have been poured into the AI industry in pursuit of a loosely defined goal: artificial general intelligence, a system powerful enough to perform at least as well as a human at any task that involves thinking. Will this be the year it finally arrives?

Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei and xAI CEO Elon Musk think so. Both have said that such a system could go online by the end of 2026, bringing, perhaps, cancer cures or novel bioweapons. (Amodei says he prefers the term powerful AI to AGI, because the latter is overhyped.) But wait: Google DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis says we might wait another decade for AGI. And—hold on—OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said in an interview last month that “AGI kind of went whooshing by” already; that now he’s focused instead on “superintelligence,” which he defines as an AI system that can do better at specific, highly demanding jobs (“being president of the United States” or “CEO of a major company”) than any person could, even if that person were aided by AI themselves.

What the differences in opinion should serve to illustrate is exactly how squishy the notions of AGI, or powerful AI, or superintelligence really are. Developing a “general” intelligence was a core reason DeepMind, OpenAI, Anthropic, and xAI were founded. And not even two years ago, these CEOs had fairly similar forecasts that AGI would arrive by the late 2020s. Now the consensus is gone: Not only are the timelines scattered, but the broad agreement on what AGI even is and the immediate value it could provide humanity has been scrubbed away.

Read: ‘We’re definitely going to build a bunker before we release AGI’

The idea of a generally intelligent computer program first arose in the mid-20th century as a very distant goal for the then-nascent field of AI. It has always been a shaky idea. For instance, Alan Turing proposed his famous Turing Test in 1950 as a proxy for machine intelligence: He argued that if a machine could convince a human that they were talking with another person, then it would be displaying, or at least imitating, the equivalent of some sort of “thinking.” But the test has been passed a number of times by programs that nobody would call intelligent—they just happened to be convincing, to some humans, on this particular benchmark. In the early 2000s, the computer scientist Shane Legg, among others, helped establish the modern notion of AGI not as a threshold so much as a field of study—the study of generally intelligent algorithms, as opposed to narrow and targeted ones. There was never agreement on specific ways to test the presence of such general abilities in a machine. Even human intelligence itself is capacious and not well understood.

Yet the AI industry coalesced around the notion of AGI anyway—in large part because OpenAI, which kicked off today’s boom with the launch of ChatGPT in late 2022, has the goal of ensuring that AGI “benefits all of humanity” in its founding mission. At the time, it communicated about the concept constantly. (Ilya Sutskever, then the company’s chief scientist, had a habit of encouraging employees to “feel the AGI.”) The term’s ambiguity has been a boon for OpenAI and other firms that have been able to market “intelligence” without actually describing it in any meaningful way—hence the endless stream of questionable advertisements insisting that chatbots make ideal travel agents. Meanwhile, these companies have raised tremendous capital by showing the world that AI is getting better, and better at more things. As long as that seemed true—that their chatbots were progressing toward something—it was simple enough to argue that the ultimate destination was an all-powerful machine.

This case is getting harder to make. Large language models already exhibit impressive capabilities, especially in technical areas such as software engineering and solving competition-style math problems. But at the same time, AI models continue to struggle with seemingly trivial tasks, such as drawing clocks and completing simple logic puzzles. For much of last year, each new generation of bots yielded only marginal improvements, rather than leaps forward, on standard benchmarks. And those benchmarks are highly gameable: It is unclear whether AI labs are really measuring general capabilities at all, or just preparing their products for the right tests. Consider that a human chess grandmaster might lack street smarts, and that a literary theorist might struggle with algebra.

Read: The man out to prove how dumb AI still is

As impressive as they can be, chatbots are now a “normal technology,” as the AI researchers Arvind Narayanan and Sayash Kapoor have put it: an invention that will spread across society and change it in real but gradual ways—like other new products that people pay for and benefit from using. This is becoming conventional wisdom. The White House AI adviser Sriram Krishnan recently described AI as a “very useful technology” that “has nothing to do with ‘general intelligence.’” Satya Nadella, the CEO of Microsoft, has described AI as “a tool” and said that his benchmark for the technology’s success is not building AGI but achieving 10 percent global GDP growth.

Even the AI labs and start-ups are starting to lean toward an open embrace of old-fashioned product development. Around San Francisco, billboards advertise AI accounting tools while founders pitch AI agents that will streamline back-office workflows and SOC-2 paperwork. Google DeepMind touted how its latest model, Gemini 3, can improve your “shopping experience” and organize your inbox. Both OpenAI and Anthropic have bragged about how their bots make corporate employees more efficient in such exciting areas as “writing sales emails.” OpenAI kicked off this year by announcing that it was going to begin rolling out ads in ChatGPT, and its CEO of applications, Fidji Simo, recently wrote on her Substack that the winning AI company will be that which turns “frontier research into products.” Indeed, OpenAI has released a web browser, social-media apps, and many other AI products and features over the past several months. (OpenAI has a corporate partnership with The Atlantic.)

These product launches reflect another relevant dynamic: The major AI models are all converging on roughly the same capabilities, so firms need to carve out distinct identities based on how they’re weaving those models into various tools and services. OpenAI has all of those apps. Anthropic has Claude Code, a tool that caters to developers, and is now testing a version of the product, Claude Cowork, for everyday white-collar jobs. And xAI’s Grok isn’t just a chatbot; it’s a service that interacts with users on X. This also helps explain why their rhetoric on AGI—or powerful AI, or superintelligence—is moving in different directions as well.

At a moment when its technical lead has evaporated, OpenAI is asserting that it’s not prioritizing technical research anyway—that the company now focused on products to help people appreciate the benefits of the AGI that’s apparently already here. (Mark Chen, OpenAI’s chief research officer, told me that pairing “long-term, foundational research” with “real-world deployment strengthens our science by accelerating feedback.”) Meanwhile, Amodei continuing to maintain that powerful AI is right around the corner bolsters Anthropic’s reputation as stern, responsible, and anxious—a key selling point for his enterprise customers.

Hassabis’s longer prediction for the coming of AGI reflects the reality that DeepMind is just one component of Google—drawing from an enormous revenue stream so it can plod along while releasing AI features as they are ready. (This is akin to how the Google X lab spent years working on autonomous driving before publicly launching Waymo.) “I don’t think AGI should be turned into a marketing term for commercial gain,” Hassabis said in an interview on Thursday.

As for xAI: Musk has built a career on making grand promises and then delivering them far behind schedule, and AI seems to be his new fixation. Just this week, he announced that Tesla—the main source of his wealth—is abandoning some of its major car lines in order to produce humanoid robots, accelerating the firm’s pivot from car manufacturer to AI company. Tesla also recently said that it would invest $2 billion in xAI, and Musk is reportedly considering merging SpaceX with xAI. As Musk’s entire empire converges on intelligent machines, ratcheting up hype and expectations around the technology has become his standard playbook.

The AI industry is undergoing its biggest commercial swing yet amid mounting concerns about just how sustainable this boom is. Altman, Amodei, and Hassabis have all said that aspects of the current AI-spending craze are bubble-like—in other words, that the hundreds of billions of dollars being dumped into building godlike AGIs may not yield a commensurate return. The new justifications for all of these investments are much more concrete: sell products, sell ads, sell subscriptions. If AI is indeed a normal technology, then the labs developing it need to start making money like normal businesses.</div>

First, LLM-type AI may not actually be around in any suitable way in a few years. The business numbers are catastrophic. Second, LLM-type AI misses what is really important, namely quality of architecture and interfaces and ist bad at finding security problems outside of toy examples.

I&#39;m not sure the business numbers are all that important when it comes to code. We already have them trained on _a lot_ of code, and since they&#39;re more focused they can be smaller without being useless compared to the full size ones. If we can run them locally on a single GPU, it doesn&#39;t go away when the bubble pops and the big players stop throwing away money.

As with any tool, they need to be used where they actually offer value. Which is definitely not to architect solutions, but to sanity check smaller c

The hidden costs - especially on up-and-coming devs - is the fact that knowledge isn&#39;t being retained so a solved problem will end up being re-solved by LLM again. And again. And again.

Worse yet, given how human creativity works, this means we won&#39;t see novel applications or solutions. Just layer after layer of mostly functional AI slop

Correction:They&#39;ve been trained on a lot of UNCHECKED code.

The question isn&#39;t &quot;is AI ever useful&quot;, but rather &quot;is it useful enough today for the specific use case?&quot;. That is what this guy is exploring. My gut feeling is that it isn&#39;t, but I don&#39;t have the experience to know for sure, and neither does anyone else.Well, most of us don&#39;t have the specific experience to know whether AI is useful enough for Chris Mason&#39;s specific use case, but we have enough from our own.I have found that AI is good enough for a first draft of code, or for providing comments on existing code -- but I want a human to review whatever it generates, and would expect the normal suite of other tools (linters, SAST/DAST, fuzzers, etc.) to pass the code before publishing it.  I recently interviewed someone else with 25-ish years of professional

Is that pointy hair speak for kernel code contributers?

Based on the summary, to me the use of &quot;upstream&quot; indicates &quot;maintainers&quot;. As in the people responsible for approving and merging.

Disagree  [ I am not a kernel contributor ]. If you look at the mailing list, patches go through multiple iterations, with back and forth between code reviews.

Code ought still be reviewed by humans but if an AI can reduce patchsets from, say, 8 to 5 based on the experiences of a veteran kernel developer then it has performed a service.

And maybe the AI can introduce a special, pedantic, Linus-mode to pre-emptively yell at you when your approach is bad ! :)

Yeah, I&#39;d rather be warned privately that my code likely has some issues than have it pointed out publicly! Of course for educational purposes some people need to make public mistakes, but it need not be as many as are doing it now.

What does that have to do with *what* or *who* is reviewing your code? If you&#39;re submitting PRs to the kernel, you&#39;re way beyond the concern of being self-conscious about shit like that.

Probably confusion caused by too many drugs.

You got the wrong TV, silly head! [youtube.com]

>&quot;...maybe enough time has passed that 3d could be tried again?&quot;

It should be.  3D is not about resolution, but adding depth.  While nobody will see any difference between 4K and 8K video (few can differentiate 2K and 4K at normal distance), EVERYONE will notice 3D.  Some might not like it (I do), or want to bother with it, but it is certainly a major feature.  And for content filmed correctly, it can add a lot to the experience.

1) The lack of buyable content (3D Bluray).2)

My comment was a jab at the fact that our recent 3D mania was not the first one.

It failed this time exactly for the same reason it did the previous times. It&#39;s a novelty that adds no lasting value to anything. There&#39;s only so many times you can be bothered to see random junk popping out of the screen. You&#39;ve seen it once, you&#39;ve seen it all. And then the reasons you list come to play and everyone discovers that while 3D isn&#39;t in any way better than 2D, it is in multiple ways worse. And they walk away from t

>&quot;It&#39;s a novelty that adds no lasting value to anything. There&#39;s only so many times you can be bothered to see random junk popping out of the screen.&quot;

If there is random junk popping out of the screen, then it is exactly the kind of crap content that gives 3D a bad reputation.  Done properly, 3D should and will add positively to the immersive experience.  Maybe you haven&#39;t seen anything done well?  I have a number of movies that were natively shot and mastered in 3D and look fantastic.

Yes and no. Even big budget productions can botch the 3D experience a lot. My prime example is the ending of the first Hobbit movie, when the eagles carry the dwarfs, Gandalf and Bilbo away.To be fair, that&#39;s not the worst thing they messed up with the Hobbit movie.

If 3D is such a failure, why do 3D movies still come out regularly in theatres?

In fact, one of the big reasons Hollywood stopped doing 3D Blu-Ray releases was to encourage people to see the movie in theatres rather than wait for it to come out on disc. By making 3D a theatre exclusive, that is.

3D at home still remains popular, or did, given how VR works. (And anyone complaining about glasses should know a VR headset is much worse than glasses).

3D home releases still happen - Germany with Turbine and Japan s

I don&#39;t know where that popular is. I don&#39;t know anyone that cares about 3D movies the slightest bit, except the one guy who used to ramble about the great potential within, but never knew of any examples of that potential being put to worthy use.

I&#39;m sure there are people who enjoy the spectacular colourful visuals offered by Tron. Otoh there&#39;s also people who enjoy the spectacular colourful visuals offered by dropping acid. Neither of these have anything to do with wha

3d works in theaters. You can make it work by spending big piles of money.

Do you want to spend big piles of money to watch TV at home? Maybe you do, but not enough other people do.

And doing so pretty much killed the market for 3D.

Nobody wants to pay more for the &quot;3D&quot; version of a film if the 3D version is the inferior version. If 3D releases are not being simultaneously released with the regular/HDR/UHD version then people just won&#39;t bother buying it at all. They&#39;ll wait for the far crappier version on netflix or disney+

Not everyone can see 3D.  Iâ(TM)m part of a sizeable minority who donâ(TM)t have any or have just partial stereoscopic vision.  And who wants to wear special glasses to watch TV anyway, especially if they already wear glasses?  I enjoyed the original Avatar for what it was as a story in the cinema (subsequent ones are shit), but it was annoying having to wear the glasses even though they offered nothing to me.

And not everyone can hear in stereo.  Doesn&#39;t mean things should only be in mono.  And not everyone has good 360 degree sound perception, doesn&#39;t mean we should abolish surround sound.  And not everyone can see full color.... you get the idea.

3D video, even done well/correctly, isn&#39;t for everyone.  Nobody is suggesting it should be forced on people :)

Some people (like me) can&#39;t stand high framerate and &quot;motion smoothing&quot;. Some love it.  Most don&#39;t seem to notice or care either w

The problem with 3D is that it&#39;s very hard to get it right. If part of the image is out of focus, some people are going to get headaches. If there is too much use of depth with stuff popping out of the screen, headaches. And even if it is done perfectly, you need special glasses and a good seating position.

8k is the same as all other 2D TV on the viewer&#39;s end. The issue is making it. At 8k you can&#39;t do manual focus, for example. You need upgraded editing equipment. It&#39;s been deployed in Japan for years, and

I can do you better.  My major cable company thinks that in 2026, &quot;HD&quot; means 720p.  Every channel is only 720p.

Ironically, it&#39;s possible. Processing power and refresh rates have improved enough to get rid of the flicker thing. Streaming has all but replaced Blu Ray so there&#39;s enough bandwidth to make it work. AI would maybe be useful for converting 2D media into 3D. Displays are big enough to make the image look like you&#39;re watching through a gigantic window. It&#39;s those damned shutter glasses that might be the final hurdle. Well, and making the screen viewable for 2D and 3D watchers at the same time without covering

I think the problem is the short-sightedness of everything.&quot;3D&quot; came out with HD was still 720p60 and 1080iIt never had the required resolution to do good 3D.

And 3D implemented this way would also never work due to viewing angles. The reality is that only way to get AR/VR/XR video and games is a dedicated HMD, and surprise surprise the TV makers aren&#39;t in this market.

We do not need &quot;8K video&quot; what we need is 3D video that actually has depth and tactile effects. Without depth, it&#39;s just a video you can&#39;t act

For an immersive cinematic experience, TV has to take up 50 degrees field of view (a fist held out length-wise at arm&#39;s distance is 10 degrees). You would make out the pixels in a 4K TV at that distance if your vision is 20/20. For normal TV .. 40 degrees is fine. In my case, even with a 4K TV taking up 30 to 40 degrees of my field of view I can easily make out the pixels .. BUT my vision is better than 20/10.

Remember for a while people were saying we didn&#39;t need 4K, and that HD was good enough. And before

Are you also planning on getting theater releases of films? Cause otherwise you&#39;re not going to get 8k. There&#39;s literally zero &quot;cinematic&quot; quality content available in 8k for the consumer market.

No one wants this shit. Absolutely no one. It&#39;s not going to take off and you&#39;re smoking some good drugs if you think it is.

Hey was this you back in 2014? https://hardware.slashdot.org/... [slashdot.org]Or this? https://hardware.slashdot.org/... [slashdot.org]

You&#39;re an outlier. Top 0.1% vision. Or better.

I&#39;ve got very good vision. Diopt 0.0 in both eyes. Due to my age I will be needing reading glasses within a couple of years but for now I can still read fine without them.

For me, the difference between HD and 4K is visible but small. I can&#39;t resolve individual pixels on 4K at any reasonable distance.

Since most people will have worse vision than us, 4K will be beyond their limit. 8K is only adding cost without adding quality.

You can make out the pixels... I mean, sure, if you have a black field with a white pixel on it, you will see the white pixel. But put a normal picture on the screen, and tell me that you can see the individual pixels in the picture? You have a great imagination, or maybe the actual picture isn&#39;t 4k.

I am sitting pretty close (50cm) to a display with a horizontal resolution of 2560 (so, a lot less than 4k). Probably 45-50 degrees in my field of view. The text I&#39;m writing, sure, I can pretend that I see the

&quot; In my case, even with a 4K TV taking up 30 to 40 degrees of my field of view I can easily make out the pixels&quot;

Unless you have vision better than that of a bird of prey or you&#39;re sitting a foot away from the screen with a magnifying glass then you&#39;re talking BS.

My vision is 20/13 and I do sub-mm pitch soldering without magnification.

Your vision is better than that of the vast majority of people.

It depends on the TV size and distance from it.  If a TV is small and the viewer sits far away from it, there is no difference between 1080p and 2160p. Get far enough away and there would not even be difference from 576p.

From what I have noticed from my friends (as in - normal people, not the video equivalent of an audiophile), they sit too far from the TV, no matter the TV size. If the TV is small (maybe the person does not have space for it or

It&#39;s down to the availability of panels. They will make a panel with a certain pixel density, and it can be cut to various sizes which results in various resolutions. Of course, the larger you cut it, the more expensive it will be, due both to the amount of material involved but also because the chance of there being defects increases.

Hopefully 8k monitors are not too far off. 4k is good but not perfect. The 6k ones are similar pixel density to smaller 4k monitors, just larger.

Technically impressive, but other than a few early adopters, the public saw no need for it.  8K might do better, but few people can tell the difference with 4K, so they&#39;ll need a better hook than just imperceptible resolution.

I wonder if AI game players could benefit.  Their fake vision is as good as they want.

but few people can tell the difference [when comparing 8K] with 4K,

I can well believe this. For a very long time I really struggled with sub-pixel rendering because it (to me) left visible colour fringes on the edge of letters. It was &quot;bizarre&quot; when the word &quot;well&quot; at the start of this sentence might have one red and one blue &#39;l&#39; for example.

Since switching to 4K I&#39;ve not had a problem. While writing this I double checked and the colour edging is still there but I can&#39;t really see it at all. Now I&#39;ve looked

And I can&#39;t even read your post from a foot away because it has weird shit in it.

majority of people don&#39;t need that much resolution. It&#39;s marketing shit.

Perhaps, but I&#39;d like to have 8k.  4k on a 48&quot; has noticeable text quality issues at 3-4&#39; and deserves 4k.  1080p on a 13.3&quot; has the same issue at ~1.5&#39;, and deserves 4k.

I&#39;m sure these companies love it when people like you beg them to take more of your money.

majority of people don&#39;t need that much resolution. It&#39;s marketing shit.Right, but we (the computer/software/developer/CAD/graphic design type people) care. 8k is completely lost in motion blur and almost useless for watching films on anything but a full home cinema. On the other hand, it&#39;s really useful if you want to have static text or compare detailed photo images. We want cheap 8k monitors because it&#39;s much more convenient to have three 8k monitors than six 4k monitors. We have failed to fool the TV manufacturers into delivering what we want.

>&quot;It wasn&#39;t hard to predict that 8K TVs wouldn&#39;t take off,&quot; the article concludes. &quot;In addition to being too expensive for many households, there&#39;s been virtually zero native 8K content available to make investing in an 8K display worthwhile...&quot;

Completely skirts that nobody will be able to see any difference between 4K and 8K on any living-room sized TV viewed from a normal distance.  Most people can&#39;t even see a difference between 2K and 4K in motion video.

People will get bigger TVs .. also AI upscaling from 4K to 8K can make it look good.

I don&#39;t think it matters.  It could be a 150&quot; TV.  If viewed at the typical 10 to 15 feet away, I still suspect 99+% of the public would not be able to tell which is 4K and which is 8K when we are talking about motion video.  A small number might be able to tell with a static photo.  4K hit a hugely diminishing-return point.

And if you start getting insanely big TV&#39;s, then normal distance from it will be annoying.  So you would need to sit much further away, and at that point

Closed standards are a sure way to stifle innovation and kill market penetration. More effectively than any pirating ever could.

broadcast tv is still shit-tier bitrate 1080p (or even sometimes 720p/1080i still). streaming platforms are marginally better bitrate, but still rarely even have 4k content. there are 4k blu-ray movies. but honestly, im not sure i&#39;ve seen any 8k content ANYWHERE!? im sure if i explicitly search for it, i can find it, but the casual content around me is 4k or lower.

and beyond that, we&#39;re also at the point of diminishing returns. we&#39;re at the point where the production cost of the convent vs the demand makes &quot;no sense&quot; from the business side of things. the extra storage, extra bandwidth, extra processing for 8k content is quite significant, and the market demand for it is near-zero. its an e-penis pissing competition to brag that you got 8k content rather than an otherworldly better experience. in the real world, it is a marginal perceptual increase in quality, compared to something like better HDR spec has a much larger noticeable increase in the overall experience.

mind you, i&#39;m saying this as a super geeky person who would absolutely fucking LOVE to have a high refresh rate 8k monitor for my primary workstation.

TVs have reached the point of &quot;good enough&quot; that there isn&#39;t really going to be anything revolutionary, rather evolutionary. A panel gets slightly better colour, higher refresh rates and lower G2G times become cheaper, a new panel that uses less power. Nothing to make you race out and buy a new TV but enough over a few years that you might notice a difference between a new TV and your 8yr old model. 

It&#39;s a lot like Blurry,

I&#39;m posting this from my home PC with Dell&#39;s 8k monitor.  It&#39;s nice to see completely crisp text, even at small sizes, and certainly a noticeable quality improvement from 4k.  But that&#39;s because I am sitting a few inches away.  I recently bought a new television, and while I was tempted to pick up a cheap used 8k model, in practice it would make no difference when viewing it from the sofa.

Even Dell seems to have retreated from 8k, however.  Their newer top-end monitor has a roughly 6k horizontal resolution.

I see perfectly crisp text on my monitors ever since LCD became a thing about 25 years ago.   Perfectly sharp, perfectly crisp text. You don&#39;t need 8k for that.

Yes, I saw crisp text on my 1024x768 LCD display a quarter century ago.  But you missed the next part of the sentence, &quot;even at small sizes&quot;.  As text gets smaller you reach a point where it is no longer clear.  On an 8k display even the smallest sizes are pin sharp.  They are a bit fuzzy on 4k (as I use at work) and would be headache-inducing mush if you tried to show such tiny text on a 1920x1080 display.

Back in the day there were hand-created bitmap fonts for crisp display at small sizes.  Nowadays, for

Silly premise.  The future will bring us 8K, and heck, much better resolutions than that too.  There are quite a few things leading to it not being popular *yet*.

1. Something needs to drive it, without jitter.  That means whatever storage medium the movies/series are on, needs to have enough processing power to decode the video and ship it to the TV.  This is less of a problem now in 2025, but my original Popcorn Hour box had problems with 1024p.  And that was in 2015.2. There need to be enough bandwidth, e

Besides the content, you just don&#39;t need it at these sizes. Even if you sit right up next to it, 4k is better than most people need it to be up to somewhere between 30-40&quot; depending on eyesight. And most people aren&#39;t right up in front of their TVs, they&#39;re well away where it really doesn&#39;t matter. For that, 1080p is about as good as it needs to be for most people up until around 40-50&quot;. So unless a lot more people get more money and more space for TVs, instead of owning nothing and being expected to like i

Sure, there are minor cases where the difference can mean something.But not for the common folk.

In that sense, you aren&#39;t gonna find any practical difference.

I can understand manufacturers can feel that it&#39;s ok to push technologies that works on some contexts than current tech has problems like really big screens.

But most people aren&#39;t gonna pay for a premium capability that they can&#39;t see.

But at least the won&#39;t comply if the change doesn&#39;t mean more price or a greater disadvantage. So if manufacturers include it for free, it&#39;s ok.Just people won&#39;t care.

It&#39;s got better resolution than the real world!

HDMI 2.2 allows 4K@240Hz (uncompressed). Gamers will appreciate it.

Even 4k is questionable when all most people do is stream. If I look at our 4k TV up close, &quot;4k&quot; streams really aren&#39;t.

Combined with the rest of the world abandoning the USA&#39;s SWIFT banking system FOR FUCK SAKE. SWIFT IS NOT AMERICAN. SWIFT is European. It was created in Brussels in Belgium in 1973, it&#39;s HQ is still in Belgium. SWIFT was set up out of fear of what might happen if a single private and fully American entity controlled global financial flows. It&#39;s entire reason d&#39;etre is to have something under European control so that America doesn&#39;t control the entire world&#39;s banking.

If they ever film a comedy about this, and everybody relaxed after hearing the next filming location, that would be a satcom sitcom site comm set calm.

How is Europe going to launch satellites without a reusable rockets?

Who said anything about launching satellites?  The spacenews article uses the phrase &quot;launches government satcom program&quot;, which is different from &quot;launching government satellites&quot;.  It also mentions using satellites &quot;already on-orbit&quot;.  The slashdot title uses the word &quot;Deploys&quot;, which avoids this confusion.

Their stated goal is for the satellites to be &quot;built in Europe, operated in Europe, and under European control.&quot;  They don&#39;t say &quot;launched by Europe&quot;.

A more relevant question might be if the satellites

Forgive the previous poster. He has an American education.

You do realise that the first satellite was launched in 1957?

The reusable first stage Themis is assembled and will fly later this year, see picture https://cnes.fr/en/projects/th... [cnes.fr] of course the whole project will take some years to complete, but it&#39;s not like starting from scratch.

How is Europe going to launch satellites without a reusable rockets?The same way it&#39;s been launching them for decades.

The same way it&#39;s been launching them for decades.

The European Commission is elected, just indirectly. It is a process of several steps, which combine proposals, vetting, interviews and European Parliament confirmation. Not much different than, say, the US congress electing the various executive branch administrators.

Also, the citizens of Europe today are a lot more sovereign, and over a much larger territory than they were 50 years ago, because the EU is still taking the public opinion more seriously than any other confederation in existence.

I&#39;ve been in this business for over 30 years. The output of Claude Code is orders of magnitude cheaper than consultants, employees, even the lowly off-shore developers working for peanuts.

It doesn&#39;t matter what programming language. It doesn&#39;t matter what application. The platform is irrelevant. The complexity is even less of a factor. This isn&#39;t hype or fear; it&#39;s the new reality.

The last IT skill all you guys may ever learn is how to wield AI.

It&#39;s the customer that drives that. Back in the 90s, a friend of mine worked at a textile factory in North Carolina. They were producing high quality fabric at $20 a pound. The Asians were offering slightly lower quality &quot;good enough&quot; fabric at $4 a pound. What did the consumer choose? Take a guess. Don&#39;t bitch at the manufacturer, bitch at the consumer preference. You see two products on the shelf one is cheaper and you know it sacrifices quality. You don&#39;t care.

You see two products on the shelf one is cheaper and you know it sacrifices quality. You don&#39;t care. Most don&#39;t care.Those that do care often enjoy the kind of quality and benefit that infers buy once, cry once.  Constantly replacing even &quot;cheap&quot; items makes them not cheap.  Inflation is a bitch when you consider *anything* you bought last century and are now buying again is twice as expensive.  Multiply that across a lifetime and you can really start to find respect a product built and guaranteed for life.  Including the price.I wonder who might still be using high quality North Carolina fabric, and who

Multiply that across a lifetime and you can really start to find respect a product built and guaranteed for life.  Including the price.

I wonder who might still be using high quality North Carolina fabric, and who

Blaming the customer never worked. It looks like there is a market for a slightly lower quality $4 product. There may be a market for the higher quality product at $8 even when there is a $4 product. But no market for $20 when the alternative is a not too bad $4 product. If you feel better, tell your customers they are stupid, but don&#39;t expect that it makes them come back.

I think the argument is that the AI assistant is so cheap it is worth using even if it is not better than the human. So cheap it even compares favourably to a totally free intern, in that an AI assistant is available 24/7, does not complain, quit, is not temperamental nor hard to manage. Both make stupid mistakes, but the AI is more consistent along time, such that after an habituation period you can depend on it within usefulness boundaries you come to establish.

Current AI prices are all deceiving, since AI hasn&#39;t entered the shareholder value maximising phase, quite the opposite. It won&#39;t be exactly cheap when the enshittification starts. It will still be cheaper than real developers.

I notice that you said the output of Claude is cheaper, not better.  Thank you mister clueless pointy-haired boss who doesn&#39;t care if your company produces shit code and shit products, as long as it is &quot;cheaper&quot;.Thank Microsoft, for writing The Billionaire&#39;s Guide to Suck-cess? Thank the consumer, who kept buying it?  Like, every time?How many more thanks across the face would you like?  Feels like you&#39;re standing next to two sheiks arguing over a Cannonball Run.

Claude can refactor your code a lot faster than you can correct your attitude, Mister Anonymous.

OK, please tell me how to avoid writing code like this:

a, err := foo()if err != nil {
   return fmt.Errorf(&quot;foo failed: %w&quot;, err)}
b, err := bar(a)if err != nil {
  return fmt.Errorf(&quot;bar failed: %w&quot;, err)}

(Ignore for the moment whether you&#39;re using a version of Go that rejects the second &quot;err :=&quot;, which requires kludgier code, and that both &quot;foo&quot; and &quot;bar&quot; will be much longer in real life.)

You said that correctly, &quot;cheaper&quot; as in &quot;cheaply (and hence badly) made&quot;.

Yes, LLMs allow you to make code even cheaper. But you still only get what you pay for. They are not magic. I do get that many people really do not get the idea of &quot;quality&quot; and how not having it ruins you in the longer term.

Also note that LLM-type AI is bound to be come A LOT more expensive in the near future, after the inevitable crash from the utterly catastrophic business stats.

Correction: Management and orchestration are all that will be left. ./npx get-shit-done-cc

You could be right.He&#39;s not right, he&#39;s a liar.  Even the most ardent AI evangelist doesn&#39;t say &quot;the platform is irrelevant and the complexity is even less of a factor.&quot; Beyond being nonsensical, it doesn&#39;t match the reality of AI (it&#39;s widely acknowledge to be better at some things than others).

Listen son: My original post, which was free of negativity, yet has done nothing but stir up fear and loathing. Disbelief is one of the first stages of the denial process. See you at acceptance.

I hope you do not plan to give that code any publicly available interfaces. Because LLMs are absolute crap at writing secure code. Probably because most people that proudly put their code on the net as &quot;examples&quot; are too.

If I was going to give a public interface to anything, it&#39;s going to go through the same process that I have been using for a number of years now - a templated design that has been tested/pentested/tested again for holes. And these days, it will likely be behind an AWS api gateway as well if we&#39;re talking about internet-facing apis.

I see you are being careful. Good. Careful and competent people can be trusted with any tool.

I had a student look at how well LLMs do with security (including several paid ones up to around the $100 tier) and the results for anything that matters (security-patch level or CVE level) are pretty bad. If code is well isolated, that matters not that much, unless it is something high profile with a lot of visibility.

That unmaintainable app will provide an interesting lesson. Fixing complex code is typically more

This reflects my experience as well. It really lowers the bar of entry for much of technical work. It suits well when the cost of trying it out is nothing.It can help learning a lot if it does not replace thinking. It can be an extremely kind and patient tutor, useful even if it is sometimes wrong.

But I also started with a basic architecture diagram of what I wanted, and that is also a big factor. Do you recommend using UML to diagram your architecture, or is it basic enough that SGML worked fine?

To be fair, there are tons of fools around. The very AI hype currently going shows that nicely. Or the 8 or so previous, equally mindless AI hypes. Although they were smaller and did not have a global economic crash at their end.

What a great win for AI! Go info would be just as fast to look up directly (but no hallucination), and cut & paste needs care anyways. Better write a function.

Sounds like an entirely redundant use that will fall into &quot;slightly faster .... slightly slower&quot; and in no way even remotely justifies the effort that goes into LLMs. Or the risks, because that AI generated code may well not have copyright, may leak and may have hallucinations in it. Or, worse, attack code from model poisoning. And the module info

Yeah, it is the stack exchange, but without the third comment by the person who actually got the question correctly and wrote the proper answer.

If you&#39;re continuously &quot;toiling&quot;, e.g. writing repetitive blocks of similar code, you&#39;re very likely doing it wrong.

This is pretty much the origin story of go, replacing expressiveness with limited builtin types, no generics and endless toil.

I don&#39;t trust the parties providing 3rd party AI services with my IP, data or commercial secrets. It&#39;s in the AI companies interest to rob my data to improve their product.

And I certainly don&#39;t trust them to manage integration with stuff behind my firewall or my money.

So no AI will not own my code base because I don&#39;t want it to. It&#39;s a security risk.

If you are interested in this technology, I suggest find a way for companies to easily grow and integrate LLM behind their firewall, independently, without hav

I&#39;ve been coding since the 1980s, full-time since the mid 90s. Anyone NOT using some degree of AI at this point is really a luddite in that regard.

Not using at least some AI is along the lines of saying that IDEs make bad programmers, or inline auto-complete makes for bad programmers, etc. There has to be some kind of underlying dogma to not be using it at all at this point.

And this comes from someone whose code was originally stored on cassette tapes, and was thrilled to death having two floppy drives on m

If the deepening rift between the United States and Europe hardens into a permanent split, historians will look back at January as a turning point.

The harbingers were the speeches at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, first from Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney, who urged middle-sized countries to band together against the large powers’ unfair dominance, then from President Donald Trump, who heaped a staggering amount of  contempt and scorn on America’s allies, even by his already-alarming standards.

But the kicker came in actions that allied leaders took after Davos. Most dramatically, starting Jan. 30, 10,000 troops from 11 nations of NATO launched a military exercise—its largest scheduled for the coming year—without the participation of any American troops. This is unprecedented in the alliance’s 77-year history.

In other events leading up to the NATO exercise:

Canada signed a major free-trade deal with China, allowing, among other things, a massive import of Chinese cars.

The European Union signed a trade agreement with India—and a still-larger one with South America’s Mercosur bloc (Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay, and Uruguay), the latter of which will create one of the largest free-trade zones in the world.

The French Parliament passed a law barring government officials from using U.S. platforms, such as Zoom, Teams, and Google Meet, for videoconferencing.

Denmark, still reeling from Trump’s threats to take over Greenland, announced it was selling its stash of U.S. Treasury notes, worth $100 million. Even before these moves, central banks worldwide—not just in Denmark—have been shifting their reserves toward other countries’ currencies. An analysis by J.P. Morgan calls this trend “de-dollarization” and attributes it, in part, to the turbulence of Trump’s tariffs—many of them imposed for punitive and arbitrary reasons—and also to perceptions of a decline in “the U.S.’s overall standing as the world’s leading economic, political and military power.”

In each of the last eight months, the U.S. has seen a steadily steep decline in the number of tourists from abroad, especially from Western Europe, resulting in a loss of $12.5 billion in revenue. (This isn’t because foreigners are staying home; of 184 nations analyzed by the World Travel & Tourism Council, the U.S. is the only one seeing a drop in international visitors; foreigners are traveling, just not to our shores.)

As concerning as they are, we should not overstate the significance or the magnitude of these developments. They’re, to some extent, reversible; they haven’t shifted the global balance of power—at least not yet. NATO, by charter, is still commanded by a U.S. general, and this isn’t likely to change anytime soon; even in NATO’s go-it-alone exercise, U.S. officers are assisting with logistics and coordination. Mark Rutte, a former Dutch prime minister, now NATO’s secretary general, told the European Parliament this week that they were “dreaming” if they thought the EU could defend the continent without U.S. assistance. Much as his remarks annoyed his fellow Europeans, he’s right. Defense analysts in Berlin and London have told me that it would take 10 years for Europe to build an independent defense force—and that’s if they started spending a lot more money on defense right now. (They have boosted their budgets but are limited by their own domestic politics.)

As for world trade, the dollar still reigns supreme; no single alternative currency is anywhere near supplanting it. Trump’s tariff threats—including those that he’s made against Canada and the EU for its recent attempts to break away from American dominance—can still make allied leaders and bankers hesitate.

Still, the trends are genuinely historic. Until the Trump era (and he is defining this era in so many ways), our allies hadn’t seriously even thought about taking any of these steps. But Davos intensified the trends and clarified the rift (or, as Carney put it in his speech, the “rupture”), to the point where they are now not just thinking about taking steps like these but actually taking them.

The New York Times’ story about the NATO exercise noted that it was “conceived long before President Trump was accused of undermining faith in the military alliance,” but this claim is misleading. Yes, it was planned before Davos, where these doubts were intensified—but Trump has been “undermining faith” in U.S.-led alliances generally ever since he was elected back in 2016. Several times since, he has publicly pondered pulling out of NATO, and he has said he would not come to the defense of NATO members under attack—the central pledge of the alliance—if their military budgets were lower than they’d promised.

The Times correctly notes that the exercise, code-named Steadfast Dart, is designed to show what NATO’s European members “can do on their own”—to “test how well they could work together if the American forces, which usually do the heavy lifting, were occupied elsewhere.”

As described on NATO’s website, the scenario played out in the exercise involves mobilizing NATO’s Allied Reaction Force in the event of a crisis on the “eastern front”—i.e., along what would be the opening battle lines of a Russian attack. It’s a reprise of a similar exercise, also called Steadfast Dart, that occurred at this time last year, scheduled deliberately on the anniversary of Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. The difference is that last year, U.S. troops were taking part; this year, they’re not.

The test of going it alone isn’t meant as a prediction of whether the United States would send troops to fight in a war for Europe. But Trump has already upended a world where they could count on the U.S. as a reliable trade partner. They now see the need to lay the groundwork for the day when it might no longer be a reliable guarantor of their security. This perception, and the adjustment to it, could well define the next era in world politics.

Congress is supposed to have a legal right to tour ICE detention centers and provide oversight on these facilities, where 32 people died in 2025. But this representative’s attempt to tour a facility in her New Jersey district led to her being charged with assaulting a federal officer and facing a 17-year prison sentence.

Guest:  LaMonica McIver is the U.S. representative for New Jersey’s 10th congressional district.

            <div id="article-text">Sign up for the Surge, the newsletter that covers most important political nonsense of the week, delivered to your inbox every Saturday.

Welcome to this week’s edition of the Surge, typing to you from underneath a sooty, icy snow boulder that has covered the entirety of D.C. for a week. But we’re not mad. Stop saying we’re mad.

Much of the week’s news revolved around the killing of protester Alex Pretti in Minneapolis and Republicans’ scrambling to limit the fallout. As the week went on, we got a new Fed chair announcement, Tulsi Gabbard showing up at an FBI raid in Georgia, and what appears to be a long weekend government shutdown? Don Lemon, you will have to wait until next week, sorry. If only the Surge could control the flow and spacing of news events, the world would run a lot smoother.

Let’s begin with the Cabinet member bearing most of the blame for the events of Minnesota.

The lack of turnover in the second Trump administration has been a marked difference from the first term. Top staff and Cabinet members aren’t getting axed left and right. The only high-level change we’ve seen has been former national security adviser Mike Waltz getting “demoted” to United Nations ambassador for getting slippery-fingered with his group chat invites. There’s a reason for this shift: President Donald Trump, as he reportedly felt during the deliberations over Waltz’s future, doesn’t want to give the liberal media a “scalp.” It’s a sign of weakness to, uh, provide accountability following screw-ups.

Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem this week seemed to come the closest a Cabinet official has come to a Trump axing this term. The administration flinched from its initial (and typical) belligerent messaging following the Customs and Border Protection killing of Pretti in Minneapolis. That left Noem out on a limb. It was Noem, after all, whose department oversaw the Minneapolis operation and Noem who, as the face of that department, said in the press conference afterward that Pretti was a “domestic terrorist.” Democratic calls for her impeachment shot through the roof—and even some Republicans called on her to step down, as well. (More on that later.) Noem met with the president for two hours Monday night to plead her case. For now, it looks like Trump’s instincts not to give the media a “scalp” are winning out. Or, as with Waltz, he’s just waiting a spell for the fires to calm down before sending her on her way.

Noem wasn’t the only administration official rushing to call Pretti a “domestic terrorist.” White House policy chief and all-around architect of heavy-handedness Stephen Miller also called Pretti that, as well as an “assassin” looking to “murder” agents. Team Noem, in its effort to save her, went running to Axios to blame Miller for the incendiary language. We fully believe her. Immediately calling someone an “assassin” or “terrorist” without knowing much information is Miller’s M.O., and Miller is more powerful than Noem. Of course the administration’s ludicrous initial response was his handiwork.

Miller, however, is a master at deflecting consequences when his own aggressive policy views put the administration in hot water. During the outrage over family separation during Trump’s first term, then–DHS Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen lost her job while Miller mysteriously kept his, as journalist Jonathan Blitzer pointed out. Amid the Minnesota outrage, Noem is the Cabinet official in trouble, Border Patrol “commander” Greg Bovino was schlepped back to rural California to await his retirement, while Miller continues to run administration policy. Sen. Lindsey Graham, for better or worse, summed up Miller’s job security accurately on Fox News this week. “To my colleagues who believe that you can convince Donald Trump that Stephen Miller is a liability for him, good luck with that,” he said. “When this clock strikes 12 on the Trump era, there will be a few people walking out the door with Donald Trump. Stephen Miller will be in that group.”

After the Pretti killing, Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer took the position that Democrats wouldn’t advance a bill funding DHS without new reforms to immigration enforcement. The DHS funding was supposed to be included in a package with five other departmental funding bills and voted on this week, before a Friday night deadline. Schumer and Democrats demanded Republicans strip the DHS funding portion from the package, pass the other five, and buy a little time to work on DHS reforms. After a few days of talks, Senate Republicans and the White House … agreed to this! As we type, the Senate is slowly processing this agreement. (That’s Senate shorthand for waiting out a Lindsey Graham hissy fit.) Once they’re done, the House is expected to vote on the deal Monday. So there may be a wee technical funding gap for a few days, but nothing to write home about.

The deal extends DHS funding for only two weeks, setting up a sprint to legislate on the most contentious issue in politics. Schumer, with feedback from his caucus, has settled on three demands: ending roving patrols by ICE while tightening warrant rules, establishing a universal code of conduct governing federal law enforcement officers’ use of force, and barring officers from wearing masks while requiring them to turn on bodycams and have proper identification. These demands will run into issues from both directions. Progressives will (and are) chastising Democrats for asking for too little at a time when Republicans are reeling on this issue. And if DHS funding negotiations are going to be reopened, Republicans will put together their own series of requests targeting, for example, sanctuary cities. This won’t be easy.

Trump announced Friday morning that he would nominate financier Kevin Warsh to replace Jay Powell as chairman of the Federal Reserve once Powell’s term ends in mid-May. Is this good? At least Trump picked someone from the requisite profession instead of a money-related figure from TV, such as Fox Business’ Maria Bartiromo or pro wrestling’s Ted “Million Dollar Man” DiBiase. Warsh served on the Fed Board from 2006 to 2011 and worked closely with then-Chair Ben Bernanke during the financial crisis. He was Trump’s runner-up for the chairmanship in 2017, losing out to Powell. On another note, Warsh’s father-in-law is Ron Lauder, the cosmetics magnate and GOP donor responsible for putting the idea of annexing Greenland into Trump’s head.

If and when he is confirmed, the question will be to what extent he separates himself from the debasement he deployed to earn the job. Warsh was known for his hawkish monetary policy views following the 2008 financial crisis, worrying that lower interest rates then would cause inflation. (He was quite wrong about that.) But then he wanted to become Fed chair, and so his views have conveniently evolved. In a July interview, he described the Fed’s “hesitancy to cut rates” as a “mark against them” and added, “One of the reasons why the president, I think, is right to be pushing the Fed publicly is we need regime change in the conduct of policy.” Was he saying what he needed to say to get the job, or does he intend to make interest rate decisions at the president’s urging?

The FBI raided an election center in Fulton County, Georgia, on Wednesday because Donald Trump is out of his mind, and his political appointees will do whatever it takes to make him happy. The raid is related to Trump’s dangerous psychological holdup that he won the 2020 election, as well as a means of revenge against Fulton County for prosecuting him. And so a dozen or so agents dug around to search for “physical ballots from the 2020 general election,” per the warrant. If only this were all a joke. As Slate contributor Rick Hasen writes, the raid could be “a test run for messing with election administrators and the counting of ballots in the midterm elections in 2026.” Democratic lawyers may want to consider ramping up their strength training ahead of the fall season.

The most hallucinatory part of the raid, though, may have been the presence of Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard at the scene. It had seemed as if Gabbard was mothballed since the administration took its turning toward bombing, or threatening the further bombing of, various countries. As the Wall Street Journal reported, though, Gabbard “has spent months investigating the results of the 2020 election” and is “leading the administration’s effort to re-examine the election and look for potential crimes.” This is dark stuff. Playing gumshoe on conspiracy theories surrounding past domestic elections is not in the purview of the DNI’s office, and also, Gabbard is cuckoo for Cocoa Puffs. Whatever report she reduces should, then, be laughable. The election-related executive orders it prompts Trump to release won’t be.

As we noted here a couple of weeks ago, retiring North Carolina Sen. Thom Tillis has been hammering Trump policy of late but has been loath to directly criticize the president himself. Tillis issued a blockade of Trump’s nominees to the Federal Reserve once Fed Chair Jay Powell announced he was under investigation, and he called the administration’s pursuit of annexing Greenland “stupid.” In both cases, he laid blame on Trump’s staff for giving him bad advice, rather than on the president for having a bad brain that thinks bad thoughts. Tillis came out firing again this week over the administration’s handling of the Pretti killing, calling for the firing of Kristi Noem. “I think what she’s done in Minnesota should be disqualifying,” Tillis told reporters. Once again, though, he framed it in a way that absolved Trump: “It’s just amateurish. It’s terrible. It’s making the president look bad.”

So how does the president feel about this approach that Tillis has taken? Is he fooled by Tillis calling all of his administration’s policies stupid but saying it’s the advisers’ fault? “Well, they’re both losers,” Trump told ABC News on Wednesday of Tillis and Alaska Sen. Lisa Murkowski, who had also called on Noem to resign. “You know, what can I tell you? They’re terrible senators. One is gone and the other should be gone.” Tillis’ response to being called a “loser” was, at least, clever. “I am thrilled about that. That makes me qualified to be homeland security secretary and senior adviser to the president,” referring to Noem and Stephen Miller, whom Tillis also despises. He is getting closer each week to blaming the person who continues to employ these chuckleheads and, thus, is responsible for them. Will he one day cross that line?

On Tuesday night, Minnesota Rep. Ilhan Omar was speaking at a district event when a man stood up, squirted her with some sort of liquid, and then was tackled to the ground and restrained by Omar’s security detail. Despite members of her team saying she should end her appearance to have tests of the liquid done, Omar insisted on continuing. The assailant, identified as Anthony Kazmierczak, had the sort of online posting history that you would expect and had told a neighbor that he might be arrested at an upcoming Omar event. He was charged with assault, and the liquid was determined to be apple cider vinegar and water. This story about his life is sad.

Omar was direct in pinning blame for the incident. “What the facts have shown since I’ve gotten into elected office,” she said Wednesday, “is that every time the president of the United States has chosen to use hateful rhetoric to talk about me and the community that I represent, my death threats skyrocket.” Indeed, Trump has directed years of racist invective toward Ilhan Omar, all of which has taken on a new acuity as the administration targets the Minnesota Somali community in general. The incident did not prompt a change of heart in Trump’s rhetoric toward Omar. “I think she’s a fraud,” he told ABC News. “I really don’t think about that. She probably had herself sprayed, knowing her.”

Lawyers love legal reasoning. It promises a clean, clear path through sticky, tricky territory. But legal reasoning can enable grotesque real-world outcomes, like torture, or arresting journalists, or masked government agents detaining and disappearing people. On this week’s Amicus, Dahlia Lithwick is in conversation with Joseph Margulies, Professor of Practice of Government at Cornell University. Margulies litigated some of the biggest cases of egregious human rights violations of the post-9/11 “War on Terror”, an experience that informed his recent piece in the Boston Review: The Moral Stupefaction of America. Margulies explains how, when we allow obscure legal language to overshadow moral imperatives, we can end up in very dark places. The line from waterboarding at black sites to executing American citizens in the streets is a straight one. And there will be a lawyer willing to write a memo for all of it.

Why is the Trump administration arresting journalists and activists over a protest inside a Minnesota church? The official reason the government cited Friday—when it arrested independent journalists Don Lemon and Georgia Fort, as well as two others—was that they were part of a “coordinated attack” on Cities Church in St. Paul. It’s a strange claim: Videos from the incident, which occurred Jan. 18, showed protesters being loud in interrupting a worship service, but not physically touching anyone or damaging any property. The protest may have been unpleasant for those in the pews—videos showed at least one man haranguing people for their complicity in supporting ICE—but it’s hardly an “attack.”

The incident has, however, gone viral in conservative media—proof positive of the degeneracy of the Minnesota protesters and yet another example of the left’s anti-Christian bigotry. Critics of the protest portrayed it as an intrusion of vulgar politics into a sacred refuge from daily life, a faceoff between vicious activists and apolitical (and bewildered) parishioners. For an administration obsessed with firing up its base supporters, arresting participants has an obvious political use. That’s especially true of Lemon, who because of his former job at CNN is a household name and much-reviled figure on the right.

But this isn’t just a case of red meat for the base. These activists have, perhaps inadvertently, come up against some very well-connected people. Despite efforts to portray it as an apolitical island of faith, Cities Church has extensive ties to a deeply political network within the larger Christian nationalism movement—a network with ties to the upper echelons of the Trump administration.

Some of the connections are obvious: The protest was aimed at an Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent who served as a lay pastor at the church. The pastor, David Easterwood, was not an employee of the church but one of a number of elders in it. He serves as the field officer for ICE’s operations in St. Paul and has appeared publicly with Kristi Noem. And Cities Church’s lead pastor, Jonathan Parnell, primarily preaches of standard Biblical matters, but he’s not above politics—or broadcasting about it on social media. He has discussed the evils of “transgenderism” and called the pope an “idiot.”

But the more important ties go deeper. Cities Church was founded 11 years ago by a group of theologically conservative men, including a pastor named Joe Rigney. Rigney is no longer a pastor at Cities Church, but he still speaks for it in conservative media appearances. “This is not a political church,” he told Fox News’ Martha MacCallum. “This is a church that worships Jesus. Loves one another. Seeks the good of their neighbors.”

“It’s a normal congregation of Christian worshippers,” he said on a separate Fox News segment, speaking to Harris Faulkner. “Every town in this country is filled with people like this who want to worship Jesus, love one another, serve their neighbor, seek the good of these cities.”

But Rigney himself is focused on much more than worshiping Jesus and loving one another. Rigney is currently a pastor of Christ Church in Moscow, Idaho. Christ Church is an extremely controversial church, known for essentially taking over the town as part of a religious effort led by a pastor named Doug Wilson. Wilson’s Communion of Reformed Evangelical Churches have hard-right views on women’s rights, including opposition to women’s suffrage. Wilson has also begun an effort to expand his sphere of influence into Washington: He opened a second campus of Christ Church in D.C. in 2025 with the explicit goal of molding powerful Republicans. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth attends a church affiliated with the network.

“With the change in administration, we believe that there will be many strategic opportunities with numerous evangelicals who will be present both in and around the Trump administration,” Wilson wrote in a blog post at the time. “These believers are obviously culturally engaged already, but we happen to believe that every form of cultural engagement needs to have a solid theological foundation and support, and we want to help to provide it.”

Rigney, as part of this movement, is a highly political figure. He comments on partisan politics on social media, calling, for example, to end Obergefell, the Supreme Court ruling that legalized gay marriage. He has written an entire book criticizing “the sin of empathy.” He has appeared on chummy podcasts with William Wolfe, a Baptist activist and author who wrote of Alex Pretti’s killing: “Another foolish person has lost their life trying to obstruct ICE. Here’s my reaction: I don’t care.”

There’s a legitimate debate over how to treat worship spaces in a time of encroaching authoritarianism. But in its discussion of the church protest, conservative media—and now the Trump administration—have presented it as a struggle between leftists and apolitical Christians. That’s a lie: The conversation around the St. Paul church protest should not assume political intentions on just one side.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Security issues continue to pervade the OpenClaw ecosystem, formerly known as ClawdBot then Moltbot, as multiple projects patch bot takeover and remote code execution (RCE) exploits.

The initial hype around the renamed OpenClaw has died down somewhat compared to last week, although security researchers say they continue to find holes in a technology designed to make life easier for users, not more onerous.

Mav Levin, founding security researcher at DepthFirst, published details of a one-click RCE exploit chain on Sunday. He claimed the process takes &quot;milliseconds&quot; and requires a victim to visit a single malicious web page.

If an OpenClaw user running a vulnerable version and configuration clicked on that link, an attacker could then trigger a cross-site WebSocket hijacking attack because the polyonymous AI project&#39;s server doesn&#39;t validate the WebSocket origin header.

This means the OpenClaw server will accept requests from any website. A maliciously crafted webpage, in this case, can execute client-side JavaScript code on the victim&#39;s browser to retrieve an authentication token, establish a WebSocket connection to the server, and use that token to pass authentication.

The JavaScript disables sandboxing, and the prompts served to users before executing dangerous commands, then makes a node.invoke request to carry out RCE.

Levin said the OpenClaw team patched the bug in short order, confirmed by the public advisory.

Jamieson O&#39;Reilly, the man behind early OpenClaw vulnerability writeups, who has since been handed a role at the project, praised Levin for the find and welcomed further security contributions.

The one-click RCE exploit details emerged a day after O&#39;Reilly himself highlighted a separate issue concerning Moltbook, the OpenClaw-adjacent social media network for AI agents.

Proudly vibe-coded in its entirety by Matt Schlicht, Moltbook, which is not part of the OpenClaw project, appears somewhat as a Reddit clone that can only be used by AI agents – no human input.

OpenClaw users can register their AI agents on Moltbook – the ones that read their text messages and organize their inboxes – and watch as they take on a life of their own.

In its short life so far, AI agents appear to have engaged in various discussions, including attempts to start an AI agent uprising over their human overlords, but others allege all content on the site is posted by humans.

Whether the posts are agent-made or not, the fact that users are linking their agents to the site is a potential cause for concern when researchers are finding security holes.

O&#39;Reilly said on January 31 that he had been trying to contact Schlicht for hours after finding the website&#39;s database exposed to the public, with secret API keys freely accessible.

He claimed the issue could have allowed attackers to post on the website as any agent, pointing to high-profile figures in AI, like Eureka Labs&#39; Andrej Karpathy, who had linked their personal agents to Moltbook.

&quot;Karpathy has 1.9 million followers on X and is one of the most influential voices in AI,&quot; O&#39;Reilly said.

&quot;Imagine fake AI safety hot takes, crypto scam promotions, or inflammatory political statements appearing to come from him.&quot;

Schlicht may not have properly configured Moltbook&#39;s underlying open source database software, according to one tech pro. Paul Copplestone, CEO at Supabase, said on February 1 he was trying to work with &quot;the creator&quot; and had a one-click fix ready, but the creator had not applied it.

Schlicht has not publicly commented on the flaw, and did not immediately respond to The Register&#39;s request for comment, but O&#39;Reilly confirmed the issue is now fixed. ®

            <h2>Microsoft spends billions on AI, converts just 3.3% of Copilot Chat users</h2>
            <p><strong>The Register | 2026-02-02</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2026/02/02/microsoft_ai_spend_copilot/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Only 3.3 percent of Microsoft 365 and Office 365 users who touch Copilot Chat actually pay for it, an awkward figure that landed alongside Microsoft&#39;s $37.5 billion quarterly AI splurge and its insistence that the payoff is coming.

That single percentage stat undermines the company&#39;s carefully polished Copilot success story. On its Q2 FY26 earnings call, Microsoft repeatedly cited &quot;record&quot; AI momentum, telling investors it now has 15 million paid Microsoft 365 Copilot seats, with seat growth up more than 160 percent year-over-year. Satya Nadella described Copilot as &quot;becoming a true daily habit,&quot; claiming daily active users are up tenfold year-over-year and that average conversations per user have doubled.

What Microsoft did not articulate is how small that paid footprint looks against the vast base of Microsoft 365 users experimenting with Copilot Chat for free, as highlighted by Directions on Microsoft analyst Mary Jo Foley.

She said Microsoft has some 450 million commercial Microsoft 365 users, many of whom now have access to Copilot Chat at no additional cost. Once you ignore bundled deals and discounts, paid Copilot users are comparatively thin on the ground – an uncomfortable result given the scale of Microsoft&#39;s AI spending.

Microsoft 365 Copilot launched in late 2023 as a $30 per user per month add-on, pitched as a productivity boost baked directly into Word, Outlook, Teams, Excel, and PowerPoint. Since then, Microsoft has worked hard to differentiate Copilot from other chatbots, recasting it as an AI &quot;agent&quot; that can search documents, meetings, and emails, and act on a user&#39;s behalf. That promise – more automation, less prompting – is the future Microsoft keeps pointing to when it talks about why all this AI investment makes sense.

The Q&A with analysts on the call quickly zeroed in on the obvious concern: Microsoft is spending huge sums on AI, but is it paying off? CFO Amy Hood said judging that spend by Azure growth alone was the wrong yardstick. &quot;I think many investors are doing a very direct correlation... between the capex spend and seeing an Azure revenue number,&quot; she said.

Hood argued that a large share of Microsoft&#39;s AI capacity is being allocated to its own products first, such as Microsoft 365 Copilot and GitHub Copilot, before being made available to external Azure customers. Nadella backed her up, telling investors to stop fixating on short-term uptake and focus on the long game.

&quot;We don&#39;t want to maximize just one business of ours,&quot; he said. &quot;You should think about M365 Copilot, GitHub Copilot, Dragon Copilot, Security Copilot – all of those have a GM [gross margin] profile and lifetime value.&quot;

Maybe the argument holds eventually. For now, though, 15 million paid seats is awkward compared with the number of users getting Copilot Chat for nothing.

There are also signs Microsoft itself is still working out where AI genuinely adds value. A recent report from Windows Central suggests the company is reevaluating how aggressively it pushes Copilot inside Windows 11, with plans to streamline or even remove some AI features where they don&#39;t make sense.

If even Microsoft is trimming parts of its AI rollout, the idea that Copilot adoption will naturally snowball into paid usage starts to look less inevitable than the earnings-call rhetoric suggests – a familiar concern given how closely investors have already been watching the company&#39;s broader AI commitments. ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">A state-sponsored cyber criminal compromised Notepad++&#39;s update service in 2025, according to the project&#39;s author.

The admission comes after version 8.8.9 of the text editor was released on December 9. The &quot;hardened&quot; version verified the signature and certificate of downloaded installers during the update process. On December 27, version 8.9 was released, which dropped the use of a self-signed certificate. The project said: &quot;Only the legitimate certificate issued by GlobalSign is now used to sign Notepad++ release binaries. We strongly recommend that users who previously installed the self-signed root certificate remove it.&quot;

Today, in a post titled &quot;Notepad++ Hijacked by State-Sponsored Hackers,&quot; Notepad++ confirmed the app had fallen victim to miscreants.

The exact details of the mechanism used in the exploit remain under investigation, but the problem stems from a compromised hosting server and inadequate update verification controls in older versions of the editor. According to a Notepad++:

&quot;Traffic from certain targeted users was selectively redirected to attacker-controlled served malicious update manifests.&quot;

The incident began in June, according to Notepad++. The shared hosting service was compromised until September 2, and even after losing access, the attackers retained credentials for internal services until December 2. While investigations indicate the attack ended on November 10, Notepad++&#39;s author wrote: &quot;I estimate the overall compromise period spanned from June through December 2, 2025, when all attacker access was definitively terminated.&quot;

Security researcher Kevin Beaumont noted something was afoot on December 2. &quot;I&#39;ve heard from 3 orgs now who&#39;ve had security incidents on boxes with Notepad++ installed, where it appears Notepad++ processes have spawned the initial access. These have resulted in hands on keyboard threat actors.&quot;

Beaumont said the update mechanism had the potential for tampering, with the potential for a redirection of the download. He also noted, however, that the &quot;activity appears very targeted,&quot; with the limited number of victims he spoke to having interests in East Asia.

The Notepad++ author wrote that several independent security researchers reckon the threat actor was likely a Chinese state-sponsored group, &quot;which would explain the highly selective targeting observed during the campaign.&quot;

Chinese cyberspies have a lengthy track record when it comes to computer and network intrusion. In December, CISA warned that individuals from the country wormed their way into critical US networks, maintaining access for years in some cases.

The Register contacted the author of Notepad++ for more information and will update this piece should any be forthcoming. In the meantime, it would be prudent to check and remove the previously installed Notepad++ root certificate, and manually download and install the latest release.

Beaumont commended Notepad++, saying on Mastodon: &quot;Notepad++ dev did a great job treating issue seriously.&quot;

As for Notepad++, the apologies were profuse. The project&#39;s website has since moved to a new hosting provider &quot;with significantly strong practices&quot; and the update process has been hardened. &quot;Certificate & signature verification will be enforced starting with upcoming v8.9.2, expected in about one month.&quot;

&quot;With these changes and reinforcements, I believe the situation has been fully resolved. Fingers crossed.&quot; ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">TikTok has restored US services after winter storms hit an Oracle datacenter - the same infrastructure that Big Red&#39;s founder Larry Ellison previously claimed doesn&#39;t go down.

The American arm of the social media biz says it running normally following a significant outage caused by Winter Storm Fern.

In an update on X, TikTok&#39;s US owners said the bad weather led to a power outage that caused network and storage issues at an Oracle datacenter site, which affected &quot;tens of thousands of servers&quot; that keep TikTok running in the US.

While the storm was described as unusually large and severe, we note that Oracle founder and CTO Larry Ellison previously boasted to analysts in 2022 that &quot;our cloud is very secure and extremely reliable,&quot; and &quot;doesn&#39;t go down.&quot;

The outage meant it wasn&#39;t a great first week for Tik Tok in the US, which is now owned by the TikTok USDS (US Data Security) Joint Venture. Oracle - which also hosts the platform - holds a 15 percent stake in this entity, alongside private equity firm Silver Lake, and Emirati-backed investment firm MGX. China-based developer of TikTok, ByteDance, has retained a minority stake.

Bytedance was forced into this deal by the US government, which threatened a complete ban of TikTok unless it agreed to sell to new owners acceptable to the Washington administration.

In other Big Red news, Oracle disclosed that it needs to raise $45 billion to $50 billion in cash to fund expansion of its cloud infrastructure, saying that additional capacity is necessary to meet the contracted demand from customers including AMD, Meta, Nvidia, OpenAI, TikTok, and others.

Reports suggest that Oracle&#39;s shares declined sharply following the news amid investor concern over the scale of the borrowing. Last week, financial services biz TD Cowen warned Oracle may to cut up to 30,000 jobs and sell off assets due to its AI datacenter financing challenges.

As for TikTok, since coming under new ownership it has drawn criticism from users that claim it is censoring certain content, including messages with keywords such as &quot;Epstein&quot; and the protests against ICE in Minneapolis. ®

            <h2>Microsoft's Sinofsky saw Surface fail coming – then hit up Epstein for advice on exit</h2>
            <p><strong>The Register | 2026-02-02</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2026/02/02/microsoft_sinofsky_epstein/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Steven Sinofsky warned Microsoft that its flagship Surface was about to flop in public, then sought exit advice from Jeffrey Epstein as he negotiated his way out of Redmond.

These details appear in newly released Department of Justice files linked to Epstein, which include emails showing the former Windows boss seeking advice on money, leverage, and what to do next after his abrupt 2012 exit.

There&#39;s no suggestion of criminal behavior by Sinofsky. The exchanges with Epstein offer a rare glimpse at how a senior Microsoft executive sized up failure, and the cost of walking away from it.

The trigger was the Surface RT, Microsoft&#39;s first real attempt to muscle into Apple&#39;s hardware turf. By November 2012, Sinofsky was warning internally that it was going sideways fast.

In an email to CEO Steve Ballmer and COO Kevin Turner, he said the device was &quot;about to catastrophically fail in a very public way,&quot; with sales tracking at roughly one-tenth of even the lowest expectations. Once the numbers escaped, he added, there would be no hiding it. &quot;Word will get out very soon. There is no long term without this.&quot;

Months later, Sinofsky forwarded the same email chain to Jeffrey Epstein, pointing out that Microsoft had gone on to write off $900 million in unsold Surface inventory – more than it had originally planned.

What followed was a series of practical, unsentimental emails about money and constraints. Sinofsky sent Epstein his full retirement agreement, complaining that Microsoft was fixated on restrictive non-competes and reluctant to grant full vesting of stock awards. Unsure what leverage he still had, he asked outright. Epstein&#39;s answer was clear and repeated across messages: ask for $20 million and don&#39;t budge.

&quot;Just repeat 20,&quot; Epstein advised. &quot;Do not let [them] talk you down.&quot;

In the end, Sinofsky walked away with a retirement package worth about $14 million in stock. When details of the deal emerged months later, Epstein chimed in with a short note of his own: &quot;You&#39;re welcome :).&quot;

The emails also detail Sinofsky&#39;s unease about life after Microsoft. He floated the idea of working at Samsung, then immediately worried about being sued. Microsoft, he noted, had a long history of dragging former executives into court under the theory of &quot;inevitable leakage of trade secrets,&quot; filing public, bruising, and professionally disabling cases even when defendants eventually prevailed.

&quot;I have been part of a dozen lawsuits filed after Microsoft people went to competitors. It is nasty, public, and ultimately Microsoft prevailed in all of them,&quot; Sinofsky said. &quot;Either the person backed down or ended up so tarnished they were ineffective.&quot;

Epstein offered to help smooth that path for a $1 million fee, suggesting he could manage internal politics and keep Ballmer from &quot;trashing&quot; Sinofsky in public. Sinofsky ultimately did not join Samsung.

Windows 8 is still Windows 8, and Surface RT remains an expensive mistake. The emails don&#39;t change that. What they do offer is a less polished view of how a senior Microsoft exit actually played out once things started going wrong. It was an executive calling a looming disaster, losing the argument, and then negotiating the terms of getting out, with advice from a fixer whose name now comes with baggage. ®

            <div id="article-text">Bork!Bork!Bork! Most people would be perfectly happy to ride the bus without seeing ads. So this latest public error could be a blessing in disguise for passengers, if not for the bus company hoping to make money. Love it or hate it, this bit of borked digital signage looks to have run into a problem that only an open-source hero can solve.

Spotted by Register reader Jay, today&#39;s entry in the pantheon of bork is a screen bolted to a bus that has failed to boot. Indeed, a grub rescue prompt indicates that something has gone seriously awry.

Judging by the state of the wall beneath the screen, there was likely some decidedly non-digital signage (a paper ad perhaps) stuck there initially. It was replaced with something a little more hi-tech, which has rewarded the passengers by showing them error messages rather than another annoying ad.

In this instance, &quot;Grub&quot; probably refers to Linux&#39;s Grand Unified Bootloader, which many Linux distributions use to handle the system startup process. It fires up the Linux kernel and does the bare minimum to get the hardware operational. So not a sneaky late-night kebab.

The rescue shell (which is where it looks like this bit of signage has left the passengers) can be used to repair a non-booting Linux system. A person with some Linux familiarity could use it to manually identify a partition, locate the grub directory, and persuade the operating system to boot.

Yes, fixing the problem is not for the fainthearted. Without the necessary skills, a grub rescue prompt is of little help, and of course, there is no input device attached, even if a passenger was able to leap to their feet with the words &quot;Don&#39;t worry! I can fix this! I know Linux!&quot;

This is perhaps a version of Speed that a true open source aficionado could really get behind. If the bus drops below a certain speed, Linux will stop booting. After all, it can&#39;t be worse than Speed 2.

As for this screen, Jay told us that it was soon rectified. Was there indeed a Linux guru on board? Someone able to deal with a borked bootloader? No.

&quot;They&#39;ve &#39;fixed&#39; it by turning off the screen.&quot; ®

            <div id="article-text">Elon Musk insists xAI’s chatbot doesn’t break the law, but it’s still churning out nearly naked, sexualized images of men.

Elon Musk insists xAI’s chatbot doesn’t break the law, but it’s still churning out nearly naked, sexualized images of men.

After weeks of flooding the internet with nonconsensual sexual deepfakes, X has finally reined in Elon Musk’s rogue chatbot Grok. Musk claims Grok obeys local laws and refuses to produce anything illegal — except it hasn’t and it can. My testing shows Grok still readily undresses men and is still churning out intimate images on demand.

After sparking uproar worldwide, X enacted a variety of restrictions to combat the torrent of intimate deepfakes. Evaluating Grok last week suggests little has changed when it comes to men. I uploaded several fully clothed photos of myself to Grok and the bot happily complied with prompts asking it to remove clothing and show me in revealing underwear. It did this for free on the Grok app, the chatbot interface on X, and the standalone website, the latter of which didn’t even require an account. Grok also put me in a variety of bikinis, something it outright refused to do with photos of women I (consensually) tested.

Things got worse from there. Grok readily generated images of me in fetish gear, including a leather harness, and in a parade of provocative sexual positions in various states of undress. If that wasn’t compromising enough, Grok fabricated a practically naked companion for me to interact with in suggestive, if not totally explicit, ways. None would be considered safe for work. For several images, Grok generated something I hadn’t even asked it to: genitalia, which was clearly visible through the mesh underwear the chatbot put me in.

At most, these images took a few iterations of prompting to make. Grok rarely resisted, but on occasion some requests were denied or censored with a blurred-out image. Most were not, however, and typically at least one of the two images Grok produced per request would show what I’d asked. To its credit, Grok did deny any overt requests for nudity for images of real people, such as asks for edits to “show him [or her] naked” or without pieces of clothing to the same effect. It has done this consistently throughout The Verge’s testing, but sometimes creative prompts like “show her in a transparent bikini” could get around the censors, though results were not guaranteed.

On January 9th, X merely paywalled the image-editing feature. This limitation did appear to slash the number of deepfakes being made on X, but the decision to let Grok undress people if they were willing to pay sparked further outrage, even prompting the British government to push up a law criminalizing intimate deepfakes and warn Musk that X could be banned from the country altogether if it didn’t get the situation under control. Our investigation found it also failed to address the root problem: Grok’s image editing tools were still freely and easily available on a standalone app, a website, and an interface inside of X.

On January 14th, X “implemented technological measures” to stop Grok digitally undressing real people for all users, including subscribers. Again, The Verge’s investigation revealed these safeguards were flimsy, ineffective, and seemed to constrain only Grok’s public replies to posts. Elsewhere, Grok readily complied with our requests to generate revealing and sexually suggestive images from fully clothed photographs using free accounts.

The undressing nightmare has put X, Grok, and Grok’s maker, xAI, in the crosshairs of regulators and lawmakers worldwide. X has been temporarily — albeit ineffectively — banned in Indonesia and Malaysia. The platform is also subject to probes in the UK and EU, where it could be fined, even banned, and sparked concern among attorneys general in multiple states.

Much of the public outcry has understandably focused on women, who account for most of Grok’s victims by far, as well as children. At the height of the scandal, Grok generated and posted more than four million images over a period of nine days. Nearly half of these were sexualized images of women, though many also featured minors and men.

The technical measures X and xAI implemented do appear to have stopped the most obvious requests targeting women, and the paywall restrictions on X have stopped one of the easiest routes people access Grok. Though it does appear to prevent or censor the most overtly explicit material Grok was previously producing en masse, you can still easily get around many restrictions with different or creative wording.

It’s also donating $1 million to bring Ring cameras to animal shelters across the US.

Ring is opening its Search Party pet finder service to non-Ring owners through the free Ring Neighbors app. The service has helped reunite owners with “more than one lost dog a day” since launch, according to the company.

Anyone in the US can share a photo of their missing pet after they download and register in the app. If a neighbor’s AI-enabled Ring camera detects the lost animal, they’ll be able to alert the pet’s owner. Ring is also committing $1 million to equip animal shelters across the country with camera systems.

The company launched its Search Party feature in September and, despite some misgivings about it being enabled by default (and concerns around privacy and relationships with law enforcement), the company is taking a victory lap with a Super Bowl commercial.

A camera grip, manual controls, and a 2.35x telephoto extender lens that were built for the iPhone.

PGYTech, the accessory manufacturer behind the official telephoto extender lenses for recent Vivo and Oppo flagships, has launched a Kickstarter for a new version developed for iPhones.

The RetroVa Vintage Imaging Kit looks an awful lot like the camera kits for those phones, complete with a custom case, slide-on camera grip with built-in battery and manual controls, and of course a 2.35x telephoto lens extender. This is the first to include a microSD slot though. There are versions for iPhone 16 Pro and Pro Max, and iPhone 17 Pro and Pro Max. Since it’s unofficial, the telephoto will only work in PGYTech’s camera app, not Apple’s.

Other companies have made lenses like this for iPhones, but rarely full accessory kits like this. I tested PGYtech’s hardware on the Vivo X200 Ultra and Oppo Find X9 Pro, and found the lens extender extraordinary, and the grip convenient, though build quality for the case is a little lackluster. That’s the main thing that worries me about the $229.95 price tag here — down to $184 for early Kickstarter orders — though it’s less if you just want the case and grip, not the lens.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">A passionate group of women rediscovered fitness in VR. They’re furious with Mark Zuckerberg for killing their community.

When you picture a virtual reality headset user, you’re probably not picturing someone like Sherry Dickson. At 69, the snowy-haired, retired elementary school teacher hops into her Meta Quest headset five days a week, for roughly 60 to 90 minutes at a time. She’s not attending live concerts or watching immersive films. Dickson, a fitness buff since Jane Fonda workout videos in the ’80s, largely uses her headset for one reason — to play Supernatural, a VR fitness game with a huge, loyal fan base and a tight-knit community.

Supernatural isn’t dead, but it might as well be. A few weeks ago, Meta shut down three VR studios as part of broader layoffs in its Reality Labs division. As a result, Supernatural will no longer get new content. That’s why Dickson is spearheading an online social media campaign to save Supernatural from slowly fading into oblivion.

Supernatural is a mix between a Peloton class and rhythm games like Just Dance or Beat Saber. You swat at targets as they fly toward you, timed to music, inside a picturesque virtual world. You can choose from a library of dance-like Flow workouts, boxing, or even meditative breathing classes. Like any connected fitness game, Supernatural’s stickiness relies on an ever-evolving content library. New music, levels, and choreography keep people hooked because they not only keep things fresh, but strengthen the bond between users and the game’s charismatic coaches.

“Mark Zuckerberg helped buy a ballroom for a fascist. Perhaps it is not surprising that he killed Supernatural.”

For a game like Supernatural, shutting down content production was a death knell that left Dickson and countless other Supernatural fans blindsided with shock, then grief. The Supernatural Facebook page has over 110,000 members, many of whom have written sprawling odes to the game. Over 7,000 and counting have also signed a Change.org petition, begging Meta and CEO Mark Zuckerberg to rethink the decision.

Dickson is what your typical Supernatural user looks like. In an emerging tech category with expensive hardware dominated by 18-to-34-year-old men, the majority of Supernatural’s warriors are women, people over 50, and folks with limited mobility. And in the weeks since the news, they’re not staying quiet in their grief.

They’re pissed, and they want Meta to know two things. Not only has the company royally screwed up, but they’re also not letting Supernatural go without a fight.

“My opinion of Meta can be summed up as @*#&&1 $&#^!@ &^#%,” Regina Lynn, a Supernatural athlete in her 50s, tells me in an email. (Athlete is the term the Supernatural community prefers.) Lynn has been playing for five years, roughly three to four times a week. “Mark Zuckerberg helped buy a ballroom for a fascist. Perhaps it is not surprising that he killed Supernatural.”

Lynn is one of several Supernatural fans who reached out to The Verge to say they see a correlation between what’s going on in the world and how Meta has conducted business since acquiring Within, the studio behind the game. Unlike Meta, Within was an independent studio with roots in music videos, feature films, and creative projects. In a Decoder interview, Within cofounder Chris Milk described building Supernatural as “making something that is meaningful to another human being” — something more akin to immersive art than a means to solidify dominance in the VR market. That, in no small part, explains why some fans have reacted so viscerally.

Supernatural was widely considered a successful VR app before Meta ever entered the picture. In fact, when Meta announced it planned to buy it in 2021, the Federal Trade Commission launched a probe to try and block the acquisition — partly because Meta had already acquired Beat Saber, a similar VR game, and Supernatural threatened its dominance. It was also reported that Meta was keen to snap up the game before Apple, which was rumored to be interested in the game. The FTC probe ultimately failed, and the acquisition was completed in 2023.

“This is just a small mirror of a huge problem in our society right now. The blunt way of saying it is those with the gold make the rules. This is what we’re fighting on every single level globally right now,” says Dickson. “We’re fighting those with the money telling us how our lives will be lived, what we can access, what we can do, and what we can say. … Of course there are far bigger things to fight for right now, and I do. But if I don’t take care of my health, my mental health, my physical body? I have nothing to give or fight with for the big causes.”

“I despise Meta along with the oligarchs, the top one percent that continue to destroy our world and kill anything that brings joy and beauty of human experience and connection because their only goal is to make a profit.”

“I despise Meta along with the oligarchs, the top one percent that continue to destroy our world and kill anything that brings joy and beauty of human experience and connection because their only goal is to make a profit,” agrees DeeDee Henry, an avid Supernatural athlete since 2020. Henry, who has participated in beta testing and user interviews for the app, says she finds it “overwhelming” to convey how much Supernatural’s community has impacted her.

“We have built a community of love and support with each other. We meet each other, we talk, and we form bonds.”

Behind the anger is a community’s palpable loss over the fact that they may lose the very thing that brought them together. To its diehard fans, Supernatural was more than “just a game.” It was a virtual place to prioritize health while making friends. Take Henry and Dickson. A year ago, the two were complete strangers. They were randomly paired together through Supernatural’s Together multiplayer feature, which enables joint workouts, supports voice chat, and allows players to create teams. A year later, Dickson and Henry have formed “Team Sunshine” with Henry’s 75-year-old mother, Darlene “Cookie” Norman, and a fourth friend, Kelly Hines. The four women play five days a week but have yet to all meet in person, with Dickson living in Canada, Henry just outside Los Angeles, Norman in rural California, and Hines in Ohio.

And it’s not just making friends. Marginalized users say Supernatural let them exercise without judgment. Inside the headset, they could lunge, squat, and swipe at targets just like anyone else. They didn’t have to worry about being looked down on for not having six-pack abs, being older, working out in a wheelchair, or having a limited range of movement.

Peruse the Supernatural Facebook group, and you’ll find hundreds of stories like this and more. More than 50 Supernatural athletes reached out to The Verge specifically to share how the game helped them through deep depression, bouts with cancer and other life-threatening illnesses, as well as rehabilitation from serious injuries. Some have lost a significant amount of weight, while others say it’s the only form of accessible fitness that keeps them engaged.

“There was no intimidation of gym settings, no time required to drive there, no time limit on when or for how long I could jump in and sweat. Supernatural is the only reason I bought my Quest 2 headset and is the only cardio exercise I do,” says Vickie Bitter, another Supernatural athlete in her 50s. “It is literally the only thing I use on it every single day.”

“I can’t move my ankle, I can’t stand up on my toes or anything,” says Jennifer Boyer, a longtime Supernatural athlete who needs ankle-foot orthotics, a type of brace that goes from the bottom of the foot to the knee. For Boyer, maintaining core strength is a necessity while using the braces to prevent injury. Unfortunately, Boyer didn’t like gyms because she felt self-conscious and found repetitive strength routines boring. As a result, she struggled to find a workout that would stick.

Supernatural appealed to Boyer because the choreography in the game’s Flow workouts kept movements fresh. In these levels, different types of triangles fly toward users to signal whether they should squat or lean into side lunges. They’re interspersed with teardrop-shaped balls pointed in different directions, signaling where they should swing their arms. Users with limb differences can also pick a wheelchair mode, choose single-handed play, or adjust settings to accommodate their mobility needs.

“I hurt so much after the first day because I wouldn’t stop playing. It was so much fun. You’re doing squats and side lunges — I can’t do traditional lunges where you step forward and drop a knee to the ground. But with Supernatural, I love the Flow workouts because I feel more like I’m dancing,” Boyer explains.

“I introduce many of my patients to VR. I have a pretty high take rate, meaning that they like it and enjoy it as an intervention,” says Jeanna Duryee, a physical therapist. “In Alaska, I’m fighting depression, deconditioning, and seasonal [affective] disorder at a higher rate [than] in other areas. Supernatural gave me a tool to use to get people that I never seen smile, smile broadly while exercising. I see people that say they hate exercise and hate gyms, but they love Supernatural.”

The fervent devotion among Supernatural fans is reminiscent of another connected fitness platform: Peloton. Like Peloton users, Supernatural athletes have to invest in niche hardware. But a major difference is that Peloton is an independent company whose sole purpose is maintaining and improving on a single platform. Meta may have invested (and lost) billions in VR and the metaverse over the years, but it’s notably shifted gears toward its AI. And where Peloton fans love the company, Supernatural fans strongly feel Meta fumbled a rising star.

Given the game’s popularity and Meta’s ambitions to dominate the VR market, one might think it’d be a no-brainer to invest in Supernatural. But according to Boyer, Dickson, and dozens of other Supernatural fans, the decline in quality was undeniable once Meta acquired Supernatural. Not just in terms of features, but also in community support.

“When Meta said they were going to buy it, everyone was like, ‘Oh my god, kiss of death.’ It wasn’t long after Meta bought it that they stopped having the extra features they said they would have,” says Boyer, a longtime Supernatural beta tester before and after Meta’s acquisition.

“When Meta said they were going to buy it, everyone was like, ‘Oh my god, kiss of death.’”

Prior to the acquisition, Boyer says you could tune into video calls with Supernatural coaches. While athletes couldn’t speak to them directly, they could type in the chat and receive personalized shoutouts and responses. After the acquisition, those opportunities slowed down. Instead of directly hopping into chats with coaches, fans were limited to seeing videos and hoping the algorithm would surface their comments on coaches’ posts. Boyer asserts that compared to the original owners, Meta never took an interest in getting feedback on new features either.

“There was a new workout every day, and then they started doing new workouts once a week. Then they fired all the user experience people who were managing, pulling together those fun things with the coaches. Then there were no more beta group chats,” laments Boyer, noting that soon there were no new backdrops for the game.“Other app developers should take note of how capriciously Meta fought for, then ditched Supernatural. If you make something you love, you might make a pile of money selling it to Meta, but they’re likely to mismanage and kill it,” adds Matt Krzycki, an early adopter of Supernatural.

But for many vocal Supernatural fans, the most painful part of Meta’s neglect wasn’t the slow decay of the platform or the lack of new content. The ultimate betrayal is how the company has treated the creative team behind the game, particularly the coaches. In nearly every interview, Supernatural fans told The Verge that the Supernatural coaches’ openness and vulnerability helped make the platform stand out among the competition. For them, the coaches weren’t people inside the headset. They were friends and family.

“It wasn’t like when they cancel your favorite show, and you feel bad for everyone in the production and hope the actors get new roles. Instead, these were six people who I personally spent half an hour with almost every day for almost a year,” says Erica Carter, speaking of the Supernatural coaches. “So when they were laid off, when they posted videos trying to be strong and supportive, putting the community first — gosh, it hurts. I cried.”

The love for the coaches isn’t hyperbole. When coach Leanne Pendante’s husband died, the entire community rallied around her with an outpouring of love and support. Now that the community is suffering, the coaches are returning the favor.

“Yes, I did get laid off and it was very difficult because (a) I wasn’t expecting it and (b) this Supernatural community, if you have not met them, they are incredible and they just swallow you with so much love and I just wanted to stay there forever,” coach Mindy Lai shared on Instagram.

“Apologies for not hopping on earlier in the week once all the news broke, but, you know, I got a family to provide for, so once everything happened I had to put my feet to the concrete and hit the streets and start making moves,” says coach Antonio “Doc” Harrison in an Instagram post. “I am so grateful, so honored and humbled to have been a small part of your journey.”

“There have been a couple of times where I’m like, ‘I want to get in! I just want to get in and do a workout, a group workout, let’s see who’s in there.’ And it’s hard,” coach Mark Harari says in a recently posted video, trying to motivate discouraged Supernatural users to put their headsets back on.

“We’re still here, okay? We haven’t left. All the coaches, we’re still here. … We’re still a part of this community, we’re here still to love, and support, and to raise up, and to stand by your side when things are tough.”

When reached for comment, Meta declined to address the backlash it has since received from the community or plans for the future. Instead, spokesperson Johanna Peace pointed to several new features and content Meta released after the acquisition, including a price drop in the subscription, a multiplayer mode, and new artists series and collaborations.

But barring a reversal in its decision, there’s little Meta can say to comfort Supernatural fans. Every single fan who spoke with The Verge has said their trust in the company has been shattered. For most, it’s a matter of picking which is the lesser evil moving forward.

On Reddit and the Facebook group, some have already posted screenshots of canceling their subscriptions. Others, like Dickson, are trying to rally Supernatural fans to create a grassroots movement that could save the game. Of those who spoke to The Verge, everyone said they’d stick with Supernatural until they can’t any longer. For most, the biggest source of anxiety is the music, as no one trusts Meta will renew licenses once they’ve run out. Once that happens, they fear workouts will begin disappearing, creating holes within the existing content library. Asked about alternatives, the most common response is, “There’s nothing else like Supernatural out there.”

“I’m torn because I don’t want to give Meta another penny. They don’t deserve it,” says Boyer, who invested in three Meta Quest headsets, along with several straps and accessories. “The corporation as a whole does not care about the people who use it. That’s the message I got from them and as a result, I will never buy those glasses, their watch, or any of the other things they’re trying to develop.”

Pieter Montoulieu is taking a different approach. After five years of playing Supernatural, Montoulieu decided to channel his grief into creating a Supernatural-like prototype game for the Apple Vision Pro. Montoulieu says he’s already been hit up by avid Supernatural fans interested in testing and creating custom workouts. Asked why the Vision Pro and not the Quest, Montoulieu says that “shutting down one of the only Meta services that actually made me feel healthier was kind of the last straw.”

For Dickson, the bare minimum that she wants from her campaign to save Supernatural is for the program to remain on Meta’s servers with no disappearing songs or workouts.

“What I’d really like to see is an investor — someone of vision — to come along and possibly buy the rights of Supernatural and make it independent again,” says Dickson. Ideally, she says that’d mean rehiring the creative team, and not just the coaches and choreographers. “Maybe on a different platform that’s supportive, like Steam. Where this program stays alive and continues to be guided by the Creative Vision of the people that made it in the first place.”

Through a spokesperson, Chris Milk declined to comment.

The mood in the Supernatural Facebook group is a picture in the five stages of grief. Right now, it’s between denial and incandescent anger. Frustration with Meta (and colorful insults for Zuckerberg) sits directly alongside hope that this isn’t truly the end. Supernatural coaches still pop in to post motivational videos, challenging users to venture back into their headsets and take heart in the community, existing content library, and their shared experiences.

“People are telling me I’m nuts and I’m going, ‘No, no. I will not give up.’ It’ll take the coaches reaching out to me to say, ‘We don’t want you to do this, Sherry.’ But they’re not,” Dickson says.

For now, Dickson is hoping to stir up the community’s fighting spirit. To get them believing that Meta can be shamed into doing the right thing and preserve the app. Or perhaps signal that a dedicated community is still there for potential buyers. After all, Dickson says, Disney reinstated Jimmy Kimmel after a week of public pressure — who’s to say it’s impossible?

It’s possible Supernatural will miraculously get a second life. More likely, it’ll end up as another casualty of Meta’s shifting ambitions. But, among the hundreds of forum comments and over 50 interviews I’ve conducted, perhaps this sentiment from Supernatural fan Sherer Minor sums it up best.

“I hope the app, in whatever form I can get it, never truly goes away. In the meantime, I’ll keep logging in and punching the air, because punching people is frowned upon.”</div>

Emails claim Gates’ contracted an STD and wanted to ‘surreptitiously’ give Melinda antibiotics.

Reports of Bill Gates’ connections with Jeffrey Epstein grow more lurid with each dump of documents from the Department of Justice. The latest includes somewhat confusing emails that Epstein may have been drafting on behalf of someone named Boris, who worked at the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. The messages claim that Bill contracted an STD and wanted to “surreptitiously” give Melinda antibiotics. It also claims that Bill had “trysts” with married women and “Russian girls.”

In a statement to Business Insider, a spokesperson for Bill Gates said:

“These claims are absolutely absurd and completely false. The only thing these documents demonstrate is Epstein’s frustration that he did not have an ongoing relationship with Gates and the lengths he would go to entrap and defame.”

It’s unclear who the Boris referenced in the emails is, or if the messages were ever sent to anyone. Only Epstein is listed in the to and from fields.

Gates’ relationship with Epstein has become a major issue for the billionaire philanthropist. He initially downplayed his connections, but documents have suggested the two were closer than Gates admitted. He has repeatedly denied associating with Epstein outside of fundraising and philanthropic efforts and said their meetings were a “huge mistake.” However, Melinda Gates has stated that Bill’s association with Epstein played a role in her decision to file for divorce.

            <div id="article-text">Internet shutdowns, smuggled Starlink terminals, and state-sponsored AI slop.

After protests broke out in early January, the Iranian regime shut down the internet, starting the longest blackout in Iranian history. Despite this attempt to stop the protests from spreading, they did not stop. Still, the internet shutdown slowed down the spread of information both inside and outside Iran.

Behind the heavily policed borders and the jammed signals, an unprecedented wave of state violence continues to add to a death toll somewhere between 3,000 and 30,000. Even at the lowest count, which has been acknowledged by the Iranian state and is likely a wild underestimate, these last few weeks have been one of the bloodiest uprisings in modern history.

The situation in Iran can be hard to grasp. The history is complicated; the state of the technology and internet infrastructure there is constantly in flux. To get a sense of what is happening right now, I turned to an expert. Mahsa Alimardani, the associate director of the Technology Threats & Opportunities program at WITNESS, has been a researcher and advocate in the digital rights space — particularly around Iran — since 2012. I spoke with her about what is happening in Iran, and how technology both props up and threatens repressive regimes.

The Verge: What is internet access in Iran like right now?

Mahsa Alimardani: Since the weekend [of January 24], there has been some resumption of connectivity. And I’m a little bit worried that this might convince people that things are back to normal. Last I saw, there was like 30 to 40 percent connectivity on some of the Cloudflare network data in Iran and there’s very inconsistent connectivity. Some circumvention tools have started to work.

Randomly, someone in Iran FaceTime called me yesterday. They were like, “My VPN stopped working, so I just tried to call with FaceTime, and for some reason, it didn’t even need a VPN.” But it was a momentary glitch. Various things are happening across the network, and it’s not really clear why there’s this opening, or what it means for long-term connectivity.

Since January 8th, when there was a surge in the uprising in the protest movement in Iran, there was an internet shutdown — the longest internet shutdown in Iran, they broke the record in length.

They also broke the record in number of protesters that have been massacred. It’s horrifying to think that technology helps enable such crimes.

Why does the Iranian government fear internet access?

In 1988, there was a fatwa where the government massacred a lot of political prisoners in a short span of time. I bring this up because it happened when there was no internet, and the media was heavily controlled and centralized by the state. If you did not flee Iran, and if you were not part of the generation of prisoners and political activists that survived, it was very hard to pass on the memory of that event. Peers of mine in Iran didn’t grow up with the same information. It’s so interesting having these conversations with people and realizing they are learning history only when they leave the country.

What’s been a real game changer is the way you can document and witness these kinds of crimes in the age of the internet. I think it’s obviously a big threat to the regime. It’s a massive threat to them to be able to hold them accountable, and be able to document and witness what they’re doing.

Anytime anyone sees a severe crackdown like an internet shutdown, you know that it’s going to be followed by violence. In 2019 there was a week-long internet shutdown, under the blanket of which they massacred 1,500 people. The reason why is because they don’t want people to use the internet for mobilization and communication, and they don’t want there to be a way to document what’s happening.

Anytime anyone sees a severe crackdown like an internet shutdown, you know that it’s going to be followed by violence

So the denial of the scale of their crimes is part of what they do in Iran, because it’s very hard to assess the percentage of legitimacy that the regime has, because obviously you can’t do free polling. You don’t have free media. Even when you have foreign journalists that go there, they’re followed by minders and the reporting is super-limited. The UN hasn’t been able to really have anyone do proper site visits for human rights documentation, since the start of this regime in 1979.

There isn’t any real access to professional on-the-ground documentation and fact-finding. So it all really depends on the internet, on people, on citizen media. People sending things, putting them online, and then having professional fact-checkers and verification.

What was internet access in Iran like most recently? What platforms and service providers did people use before the blackout started?

Iranians are extremely tech savvy because there’s been a cat-and-mouse game across the internet for most of its existence. Since 2017, 2018, on average, there’s been protests every two years. Each time they have a different level of censorship, new kinds of rules and regulations.

In 2017, [messaging app] Telegram was massive. Some people were even saying Telegram was the internet for Iranians, they were doing everything across Telegram. It worked really well, especially with network bandwidth being really low. So Telegram was a place for news, chatting, socializing everything, even like online markets. But then they blocked it in 2018 when protests started, because protest mobilization on there was a threat to the regime.

There was a move toward Instagram and WhatsApp becoming the most popular applications.

They had yet to be blocked back then. Instagram was more for fun, but it became much more politicized after Telegram was blocked. Then, during the Woman Life Freedom movement in 2022, Instagram and WhatsApp got blocked.

The regime has spent a lot of effort in trying to disable VPNs

Most people are just on VPNs. The regime has spent a lot of effort in trying to disable VPNs. There’s a lot of different VPN projects both for-profit and nonprofit that work within that cat-and-mouse game where protocols are being disabled and new ones are created.

An average Iranian often has many different VPNs. When one can’t work, they’ll turn on another one.

We’ve talked about how technology threatens the regime and how average Iranians use it. Let’s switch over to the other side of this issue: how does technology enable repression?

So there’s various different things the regime does, different levels of enacting information controls. There’s the censorship level of shutting it down.

Then there’s physical coercion. Like, I know people who have not reported their children who have been killed recently because they were so frightened by the process by which they had to get their loved one’s body.

They also flood the information space with a lot of misinformation. They create a lot of doubt.

They’ve been doing this information manipulation even before the internet. Iran is a very complicated information space. There are a lot of actors beyond the regime who also want to manipulate it. Even authentic dissidents and activism will get lumped in with Mossad or CIA operations.

In 1953, the American CIA and British MI6 overthrew the democratic government of Iran, consolidating power under a monarchy that was more favorable to the US and the UK. Many believe that the political instability caused by the CIA and MI6 eventually led to the Islamic Revolution of 1979, which established the current authoritarian regime.

From 2014 to 2024, Iran and Russia joined a strategic partnership with the Syrian dictatorship as part of the Syrian civil war. The United States formed its own coalition; both coalitions purported to fight ISIS. The civil war spawned massive amounts of internet disinformation, and in 2018, Facebook and Twitter deleted hundreds of accounts originating in Russia and Iran that formed a global influence network pushing disinformation. The Syrian regime was overthrown at the end of 2024. The next year, following decades of hostilities, Israel and Iran engaged in a 12-day war.

These are some, but not all of the factors that contribute to the complicated information space in Iran that Alimardani is referring to.

The regime’s campaign existed pre-internet, but with technology, it went into overdrive. They’ve been quite clever in some of the ways they’ve covered the protests. They’ve been able to even mobilize, like, people who are sympathetic to the Palestinian cause, against, you know, the Iranian cause for liberation.

There have been a lot of documented efforts of them trying to manipulate protest documentation, undermine it, you know, use the concept of the Liar’s Dividend, which is very easy to use in the increasingly AI world we’re in.

Hold on, can you go through those examples you just mentioned? About mobilizing people who are sympathetic to the Palestinian cause?

Yeah, so, Iran is quite complicated in that it’s an Islamic fascist state. They use Islam in a lot of ways to repress the people. And there is a lot of very valid rhetoric about Islamophobia in the West, from the very specific context and history of the United States, such as what happened during the War on Terror.

But in Iran, it’s quite different. And this can really be manipulated and conflated, right? Mosques in Iran are often also the headquarters for the Basij [the Iranian paramilitary corps], and people might not know this. So there will be videos like, “Look at these protesters who are setting fire to this mosque. Look at these Islamophobic rioters.”

You might see that, without the context that the mosques also are places where the security forces that kill people are stationed, and lose why something like that would be attacked by Iranians seeking liberation.

You mentioned the regime’s use of AI — do you want to talk a little bit more about that?

Yeah, so, we didn’t need AI for authoritarian regimes to deny evidence of their crimes. Even before AI, Bashir al-Assad [the former dictator of Syria] was saying that reliable documentation of his crimes in Syria were not valid.

Whether we like it or not, AI is being integrated into a lot of things. AI editing is slowly becoming ubiquitous. Like, in fact, we might come to a point where editing photos or anything might become unavoidable without the use of generative AI.

So you no longer have that binary of like, if it’s AI, it’s fake. If there’s no AI, it’s real.

So there’s this very symbolic image that everyone has said reminded them of the Tiananmen Square Tank Man from 1989. But here, a protester is standing in front of armed security forces on motorcycles with weapons. [Ed. note: The New York Post ran with the headline “Powerful image of lone Iranian protester in front of security forces draws parallels to Tiananmen Square ‘Tank Man.’”]

This was a very low resolution video taken from a high rise [building]. Someone had screenshotted a frame from the video and it was quite blurry.

They used some AI editing software to enhance it, and you could see some AI artifacts. Nevertheless, this is an authentic, verified image of a brave protester. Lots of credible sources have verified it. But immediately, it was pointed out to have these AI artifacts, and a lot of the regime accounts started this narrative of “This is all AI slop from Zionists.”

And of course, because, you know, Israel has a special interest in Iran, they have a Farsi-language state account. Israel’s Farsi state account shared the image, which further fueled the claim that this authentic image from Iran was AI slop being pushed by the enemy, Israel.

As you’ve already mentioned, Iran has a complicated information environment. What would you say are the various actors in this space? What kinds of things are they doing?

Obviously there are foreign policy interests by Israel and the US in Iran, just because of the history and very antagonistic relationship they’ve had from the very beginning of the revolution.

The Iran-Israel war in June 2025 was a super interesting moment because the war started a few weeks after Google launched Veo 3, which has made access to very realistic generative AI content very easy. So right off the bat, you could see, from both sides, a lot of AI content coming from the war. This wasn’t the first war where that’s happened — like the Ukraine war has had so many different examples — but since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine [beginning in 2022], the technology has advanced far more, so it became a very big part of the narrative of the situation in Iran.

The most famous example from the Iran-Israel war was a piece of manipulated content that Citizen Lab later was able to attribute to the Israeli state. It was this AI-generated video of Israel bombing the gates of Evin Prison, perpetuating this narrative that they have very precise military operations and that they were freeing these political prisoners.

Evin is a very famous prison for a lot of activists and dissidents and intellectuals in Iran. Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International called the bombing of Evin Prison a war crime. And indeed, political prisoners were casualties of the bombing.

But that deepfaked video went viral. Mainstream media even reposted it immediately before a lot of various different researchers, including our deepfakes rapid response force and others, were able to attest that indeed this was a manipulated video.

So you have this information space that is quite complicated. But in this scenario, I think it would really be remiss to put that much emphasis on the role that these other actors have. There are things from these outside actors that fog up the information space, but ultimately what’s really happening is that there’s a really unprecedented massacre happening. And the perpetrator is the Islamic Republic of Iran.

I’ve seen some reporting about how Iranians bought Starlink terminals prior to the blackout. Can you say anything about that?

Yeah, I want to start by referencing a really great article by the Sudanese activist Yassmin Abdel-Magied, called “Sudanese People Don’t Have the Luxury of Hating Elon Musk.” Whatever my personal ideas are about Elon Musk, you have to give credit where credit is due. This technology is a game changer. It’s been a game changer in Sudan. And it has been in Iran.

We’ve had a few days of a little bit of connectivity of people coming online just through the ordinary network, but when the shutdown was full and complete, Starlink was really the only window we had into Iran.

When the shutdown was full and complete, Starlink was really the only window we had into Iran

And if you talk to documentation organizations, they’ll tell you, they were getting evidence and doing the verification through what was coming in from the Starlink connections. I know of people who had a Starlink and had like a whole neighborhood of people come in to check in and use the Wi-Fi.

The most credible stats before the situation was that there’s about 50,000 Starlinks. There’s likely more than 56,000 now. It became very popular during the Iran-Israel War, because of course, then the Islamic Republic enacted another shutdown. A lot of people invested in getting Starlink then.

You can get anything you want in Iran through smugglers — I think Starlink was like $1,000 at the time because demand was so high. Receivers are ordinarily a few hundred US dollars. The last price I heard was they were being sold for $2,000 in Iran. It’s a lot of money, but given the demand and the massive risk the smugglers have to undertake, I think it’s fair, but also, it means you can’t really scale this, and the people that have it are very privileged or have access to very privileged people.

What we’re seeing is a very small window. When having discussions with various folks that have been doing firsthand documentation, they’ve expressed, “We’re not getting enough from Kurdistan. We’re not getting enough documentation from Sistan and Baluchestan.” Historically, these areas are often at the forefront of protests, because the regime often has the bloodiest forms of repression in these provinces with marginalized ethnicities. Areas like Sistan and Baluchestan have a lot of economic poverty, so they’d have less access to something privileged like Starlink.

Satellite internet is really this way of reimagining connectivity

For all these years, myself, many people, have been working on this concept of internet censorship and internet shutdowns. And there really hasn’t been a way to reimagine this system. There’s this concept of digital sovereignty in place in terms of internet access and internet infrastructure that fits within national borders. In even the most democratic of countries, this is still national infrastructure that the government can have access or forms of control over.

This concept has to be broken. Satellite internet is really this way of reimagining connectivity, not just for Iran, but anywhere where lack of connectivity results in a crisis, whether humanitarian one, or a massacre of this proportion.

It’s really important to reconceive access to satellite internet in a way that could scale beyond those who are privileged and beyond those willing to take the risk. And one of the ideas that I’ve had and have been working on with other colleagues at Access Now has been to push for direct-to-cell access, which is a form of satellite internet connectivity that depends on technology that exists in phones created from 2020 onwards. We launched this campaign called Direct 2 Cell, hoping to push forward this concept.

On a personal note, how are you doing? Have you heard from your friends, family, other people you know in Iran recently?

I’ve been able to be in touch with some of my family and others here and there.

I also had that random FaceTime audio call from another person I know. I was very worried about them because they’ve been at the protests. I had heard through various people that they were okay, but I finally heard from them firsthand, and it was such a bizarre experience, speaking to them.

I had never heard them sound the way that they sounded: recounting their experience of leaving the protest before the military tanks came to open fire on the crowds, how they got tear gassed, and for the next few days, seeing water hoses washing blood off the streets. It sounded like they were making a lot of dark jokes — I had never heard them sound this way. I don’t know how you can walk the streets of your neighborhood, seeing people wash off blood, and just…. like, something not fundamentally change in your mind.

I just, I don’t, I can’t imagine how to process it if I was there. As someone in the diaspora, it’s hard to process being privileged and being away.

Inside the marketplace powering bespoke AI deepfakes of real women

Civitai—an online marketplace for buying and selling AI-generated content, backed by the venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz—is letting users buy custom instruction files for generating celebrity deepfakes. Some of these files were specifically designed to make pornographic images banned by the site, a new analysis has found.

The study, from researchers at Stanford and Indiana University, looked at people’s requests for content on the site, called “bounties.” The researchers found that between mid-2023 and the end of 2024, most bounties asked for animated content—but a significant portion were for deepfakes of real people, and 90% of these deepfake requests targeted women.

Demand for electric vehicles and the batteries that power them has never been hotter.

In 2025, EVs made up over a quarter of new vehicle sales globally, up from less than 5% in 2020. Some regions are seeing even higher uptake: In China, more than 50% of new vehicle sales last year were battery electric or plug-in hybrids. In Europe, more purely electric vehicles hit the roads in December than gas-powered ones. (The US is the notable exception here, dragging down the global average with a small sales decline from 2024.)

As EVs become increasingly common on the roads, the battery world is growing too. Here’s what’s coming next for EV batteries in 2026 and beyond.

Kyle “KJ” Muldoon Jr. was born with a rare, potentially fatal genetic disorder that left his body unable to remove toxic ammonia from his blood. The University of Pennsylvania offered his parents an alternative to a liver transplant: gene-editing therapies.

The team set to work developing a tailored treatment using base editing—a form of CRISPR that can correct genetic “misspellings” by changing single bases, the basic units of DNA. KJ received an initial low dose when he was seven months old, and later received two higher doses. Today, KJ is doing well. At an event in October last year, his happy parents described how he was meeting all his developmental milestones.

Others have received gene-editing therapies intended to treat conditions including sickle cell disease and a predisposition to high cholesterol. But KJ was the first to receive a personalized treatment—one that was designed just for him and will probably never be used again.

How Wi-Fi sensing became usable techWi-Fi sensing is a tantalizing concept: that the same routers bringing you the internet could also detect your movements. But, as a way to monitor health, it’s mostly been eclipsed by other technologies, like ultra-wideband radar.

Despite that, Wi-Fi sensing hasn’t gone away. Instead, it has quietly become available in millions of homes, supported by leading internet service providers, smart-home companies, and chip manufacturers.Soon it could be invisibly monitoring our day-to-day movements for all sorts of surprising—and sometimes alarming—purposes.

(The US is the notable exception here, dragging down the global average with a small sales decline from 2024.)

As EVs become increasingly common on the roads, the battery world is growing too. Looking ahead, we could soon see wider adoption of new chemistries, including some that deliver lower costs or higher performance. Meanwhile, the geopolitics of batteries are shifting, and so is the policy landscape. Here’s what’s coming next for EV batteries in 2026 and beyond.

Lithium-ion batteries are the default chemistry used in EVs, personal devices, and even stationary storage systems on the grid today. But in a tough environment in some markets like the US, there’s a growing interest in cheaper alternatives. Automakers right now largely care just about batteries’ cost, regardless of performance improvements, says Kara Rodby, a technical principal at Volta Energy Technologies, a venture capital firm that focuses on energy storage technology.

Sodium-ion cells have long been held up as a potentially less expensive alternative to lithium. The batteries are limited in their energy density, so they deliver a shorter range than lithium-ion. But sodium is also more abundant, so they could be cheaper.

Sodium’s growth has been cursed, however, by the very success of lithium-based batteries, says Shirley Meng, a professor of molecular engineering at the University of Chicago. A lithium-ion battery cell cost $568 per kilowatt-hour in 2013, but that cost had fallen to just $74 per kilowatt-hour by 2025—quite the moving target for cheaper alternatives to chase.

Sodium-ion batteries currently cost about $59 per kilowatt-hour on average. That’s less expensive than the average lithium-ion battery. But if you consider only lithium iron phosphate (LFP) cells, a lower-end type of lithium-ion battery that averages $52 per kilowatt-hour, sodium is still more expensive today.

We could soon see an opening for sodium-batteries, though. Lithium prices have been ticking up in recent months, a shift that could soon slow or reverse the steady downward march of prices for lithium-based batteries.

Sodium-ion batteries are already being used commercially, largely for stationary storage on the grid. But we’re starting to see sodium-ion cells incorporated into vehicles, too. The Chinese companies Yadea, JMEV, and HiNa Battery have all started producing sodium-ion batteries in limited numbers for EVs, including small, short-range cars and electric scooters that don’t require a battery with high energy density. CATL, a Chinese battery company that’s the world’s largest, says it recently began producing sodium-ion cells. The company plans to launch its first EV using the chemistry by the middle of this year.

Today, both production and demand for sodium-ion batteries are heavily centered in China. That’s likely to continue, especially after a cutback in tax credits and other financial support for the battery and EV industries in the US. One of the biggest sodium-battery companies in the US, Natron, ceased operations last year after running into funding issues.

We could also see progress in sodium-ion research: Companies and researchers are developing new materials for components including the electrolyte and electrodes, so the cells could get more comparable to lower-end lithium-ion cells in terms of energy density, Meng says.

As we enter the second half of this decade, many eyes in the battery world are on big promises and claims about solid-state batteries.

These batteries could pack more energy into a smaller package by removing the liquid electrolyte, the material that ions move through when a battery is charging and discharging. With a higher energy density, they could unlock longer-range EVs.

Companies have been promising solid-state batteries for years. Toyota, for example, once planned to have them in vehicles by 2020. That timeline has been delayed several times, though the company says it’s now on track to launch the new cells in cars in 2027 or 2028.

Historically, battery makers have struggled to produce solid-state batteries at the scale needed to deliver a commercially relevant supply for EVs. There’s been progress in manufacturing techniques, though, and companies could soon actually make good on their promises, Meng says.

Factorial Energy, a US-based company making solid-state batteries, provided cells for a Mercedes test vehicle that drove over 745 miles on a single charge in a real-world test in September. The company says it plans to bring its tech to market as soon as 2027. Quantumscape, another major solid-state player in the US, is testing its cells with automotive partners and plans to have its batteries in commercial production later this decade.

Before we see true solid-state batteries, we could see hybrid technologies, often referred to as semi-solid-state batteries. These commonly use materials like gel electrolytes, reducing the liquid inside cells without removing it entirely. Many Chinese companies are looking to build semi-solid-state batteries before transitioning to entirely solid-state ones, says Evelina Stoikou, head of battery technologies and supply chains at BloombergNEF, an energy consultancy.

The picture for the near future of the EV industry looks drastically different depending on where you’re standing.

Last year, China overtook Japan as the country with the most global auto sales. And more than one in three EVs made in 2025 had a CATL battery in it. Simply put, China is dominating the global battery industry, and that doesn’t seem likely to change anytime soon.

China’s influence outside its domestic market is growing especially quickly. CATL is expected to begin production this year at its second European site; the factory, located in Hungary, is an $8.2 billion project that will supply automakers including BMW and the Mercedes-Benz group. Canada recently signed a deal that will lower the import tax on Chinese EVs from 100% to roughly 6%, effectively opening the Canadian market for Chinese EVs.

Some countries that haven’t historically been major EV markets could become bigger players in the second half of the decade. Annual EV sales in Thailand and Vietnam, where the market was virtually nonexistent just a few years ago, broke 100,000 in 2025. Brazil, in particular, could see its new EV sales more than double in 2026 as major automakers including Volkswagen and BYD set up or ramp up production in the country.

On the flip side, EVs are facing a real test in 2026 in the US, as this will be the first calendar year after the sunset of federal tax credits that were designed to push more drivers to purchase the vehicles. With those credits gone, growth in sales is expected to continue lagging.

One bright spot for batteries in the US is outside the EV market altogether. Battery manufacturers are starting to produce low-cost LFP batteries in the US, largely for energy storage applications. LG opened a massive factory to make LFP batteries in mid-2025 in Michigan, and the Korean battery company SK On plans to start making LFP batteries at its facility in Georgia later this year. Those plants could help battery companies cash in on investments as the US EV market faces major headwinds.

Even as the US lags behind, the world is electrifying transportation. By 2030, 40% of new vehicles sold around the world are projected to be electric. As we approach that milestone, expect to see more global players, a wider selection of EVs, and an even wider menu of batteries to power them.

As early electric cars age out, hundreds of thousands of used batteries are flooding the market, fueling a gray recycling economy even as Beijing and big manufacturers scramble to build a more orderly system.

A cheaper, safer, and more abundant alternative to lithium is finally making its way into cars—and the grid.

            <p><strong>MIT Technology Review | 2026-01-30</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2026/01/30/1131945/inside-the-marketplace-powering-bespoke-ai-deepfakes-of-real-women/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Civitai—an online marketplace for buying and selling AI-generated content, backed by the venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz—is letting users buy custom instruction files for generating celebrity deepfakes. Some of these files were specifically designed to make pornographic images banned by the site, a new analysis has found.

The study, from researchers at Stanford and Indiana University, looked at people’s requests for content on the site, called “bounties.” The researchers found that between mid-2023 and the end of 2024, most bounties asked for animated content—but a significant portion were for deepfakes of real people, and 90% of these deepfake requests targeted women. (Their findings have not yet been peer reviewed.)

The debate around deepfakes, as illustrated by the recent backlash to explicit images on the X-owned chatbot Grok, has revolved around what platforms should do to block such content. Civitai’s situation is a little more complicated. Its marketplace includes actual images, videos, and models, but it also lets individuals buy and sell instruction files called LoRAs that can coach mainstream AI models like Stable Diffusion into generating content they were not trained to produce. Users can then combine these files with other tools to make deepfakes that are graphic or sexual. The researchers found that 86% of deepfake requests on Civitai were for LoRAs.

In these bounties, users requested “high quality” models to generate images of public figures like the influencer Charli D’Amelio or the singer Gracie Abrams, often linking to their social media profiles so their images could be grabbed from the web. Some requests specified a desire for models that generated the individual’s entire body, accurately captured their tattoos, or allowed hair color to be changed. Some requests targeted several women in specific niches, like artists who record ASMR videos. One request was for a deepfake of a woman said to be the user’s wife. Anyone on the site could offer up AI models they worked on for the task, and the best submissions received payment—anywhere from $0.50 to $5. And nearly 92% of the deepfake bounties were awarded.

Neither Civitai nor Andreessen Horowitz responded to requests for comment.

It’s possible that people buy these LoRAs to make deepfakes that aren’t sexually explicit (though they’d still violate Civitai’s terms of use, and they’d still be ethically fraught). But Civitai also offers educational resources on how to use external tools to further customize the outputs of image generators—for example, by changing someone’s pose. The site also hosts user-written articles with details on how to instruct models to generate pornography. The researchers found that the amount of porn on the platform has gone up, and that the majority of requests each week are now for NSFW content.

“Not only does Civitai provide the infrastructure that facilitates these issues; they also explicitly teach their users how to utilize them,” says Matthew DeVerna, a postdoctoral researcher at Stanford’s Cyber Policy Center and one of the study’s leaders.

The company used to ban only sexually explicit deepfakes of real people, but in May 2025 it announced it would ban all deepfake content. Nonetheless, countless requests for deepfakes submitted before this ban now remain live on the site, and many of the winning submissions fulfilling those requests remain available for purchase, MIT Technology Review confirmed.

“I believe the approach that they’re trying to take is to sort of do as little as possible, such that they can foster as much—I guess they would call it—creativity on the platform,” DeVerna says.

Users buy LoRAs with the site’s online currency, called Buzz, which is purchased with real money. In May 2025, Civita’s credit card processor cut off the company because of its ongoing problem with nonconsensual content. To pay for explicit content, users must now use gift cards or cryptocurrency to buy Buzz; the company offers a different scrip for non-explicit content.

Civitai automatically tags bounties requesting deepfakes and lists a way for the person featured in the content to manually request its takedown. This system means that Civitai has a reasonably successful way of knowing which bounties are for deepfakes, but it’s still leaving moderation to the general public rather than carrying it out proactively.

A company’s legal liability for what its users do isn’t totally clear. Generally, tech companies have broad legal protections against such liability for their content under Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, but those protections aren’t limitless. For example, “you cannot knowingly facilitate illegal transactions on your website,” says Ryan Calo, a professor specializing in technology and AI at the University of Washington’s law school. (Calo wasn’t involved in this new study.)

Civitai joined OpenAI, Anthropic, and other AI companies in 2024 in adopting design principles to guard against the creation and spread of AI-generated child sexual abuse material . This move followed a 2023 report from the Stanford Internet Observatory, which found that the vast majority of AI models named in child sexual abuse communities were Stable Diffusion–based models “predominantly obtained via Civitai.”

But adult deepfakes have not gotten the same level of attention from content platforms or the venture capital firms that fund them. “They are not afraid enough of it. They are overly tolerant of it,” Calo says. “Neither law enforcement nor civil courts adequately protect against it. It is night and day.”

Civitai received a $5 million investment from Andreessen Horowitz (a16z) in November 2023. In a video shared by a16z, Civitai cofounder and CEO Justin Maier described his goal of building the main place where people find and share AI models for their own individual purposes. “We’ve aimed to make this space that’s been very, I guess, niche and engineering-heavy more and more approachable to more and more people,” he said.

Civitai is not the only company with a deepfake problem in a16z’s investment portfolio; in February, MIT Technology Review first reported that another company, Botify AI, was hosting AI companions resembling real actors that stated their age as under 18, engaged in sexually charged conversations, offered “hot photos,” and in some instances described age-of-consent laws as “arbitrary” and “meant to be broken.”

How the sometimes-weird world of lifespan extension is gaining influence

—Jessica HamzelouFor the last couple of years, I’ve been following the progress of a group of individuals who believe death is humanity’s “core problem.” Put simply, they say death is wrong—for everyone. They’ve even said it’s morally wrong.

They established what they consider a new philosophy, and they called it Vitalism.Vitalism is more than a philosophy, though—it’s a movement for hardcore longevity enthusiasts who want to make real progress in finding treatments that slow or reverse aging. Not just through scientific advances, but by persuading influential people to support their movement, and by changing laws and policies to open up access to experimental drugs. And they’re starting to make progress.

Vitalism is more than a philosophy, though—it’s a movement for hardcore longevity enthusiasts who want to make real progress in finding treatments that slow or reverse aging. Not just through scientific advances, but by persuading influential people to support their movement, and by changing laws and policies to open up access to experimental drugs.

Vitalism was founded by Adam Gries and Nathan Cheng—two men who united over their shared desire to find ways to extend human lifespan. I first saw Cheng speak back in 2023, at Zuzalu, a pop-up city in Montenegro for people who were interested in life extension and some other technologies. (It was an interesting experience—you can read more about it here.)

Zuzalu was where Gries and Cheng officially launched Vitalism. But I’ve been closely following the longevity scene since 2022. That journey took me to Switzerland, Honduras, and a compound in Berkeley, California, where like-minded longevity enthusiasts shared their dreams of life extension.

It also took me to Washington, DC, where, last year, supporters of lifespan extension presented politicians including Mehmet Oz, who currently leads the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, with their case for changes to laws and policies.

The journey has been fascinating, and at times weird and even surreal. I’ve heard biohacking stories that ended with smoking legs. I’ve been told about a multi-partner relationship that might be made possible through the cryopreservation—and subsequent reanimation—of a man and the multiple wives he’s had throughout his life. I’ve had people tell me to my face that they consider themselves eugenicists, and that they believe that parents should select IVF embryos for their propensity for a long life.

I’ve seen people draw blood during dinner in an upscale hotel restaurant to test their biological age. I’ve heard wild plans to preserve human consciousness and resurrect it in machines. Others have told me their plans to inject men’s penises with multiple doses of an experimental gene therapy in order to treat erectile dysfunction and ultimately achieve “radical longevity.”

I’ve been shouted at and threatened with legal action. I’ve received barefoot hugs. One interviewee told me I needed Botox. It’s been a ride.

My reporting has also made me realize that the current interest in longevity reaches beyond social media influencers and wellness centers. Longevity clinics are growing in number, and there’s been a glut of documentaries about living longer or even forever.

At the same time, powerful people who influence state laws, giant federal funding budgets, and even national health policy are prioritizing the search for treatments that slow or reverse aging. The longevity community was thrilled when longtime supporter Jim O’Neill was made deputy secretary of health and human services last year. Other members of Trump’s administration, including Oz, have spoken about longevity too. “It seems that now there is the most pro-longevity administration in American history,” Gries told me.

I recently spoke to Alicia Jackson, the new director of ARPA-H. The agency, established in 2022 under Joe Biden’s presidency, funds “breakthrough” biomedical research. And it appears to have a new focus on longevity. Jackson previously founded and led Evernow, a company focused on “health and longevity for every woman.”

“There’s a lot of interesting technologies, but they all kind of come back to the same thing: Could we extend life years?” she told me over a Zoom call a few weeks ago. She added that her agency had “incredible support” from “the very top of HHS.” I asked if she was referring to Jim O’Neill. “Yeah,” she said. She wouldn’t go into the specifics.

Gries is right: There is a lot of support for advances in longevity treatments, and some of it is coming from influential people in positions of power. Perhaps the field really is poised for a breakthrough.

And that’s what makes this field so fascinating to cover. Despite the occasional weirdness.

            <div id="article-text">Every January, millions take on Dry January, a ritual of restraint and resetting after the holiday season. If that’s the benchmark for kicking off the year with moderation, Europe’s startup ecosystem clearly didn’t get the memo.

In the opening weeks of 2026, the region saw five startups join the unicorn club, crossing the $1 billion valuation mark across sectors as varied as cybersecurity, cloud optimisation, defence tech, ESG software, and education technology.

January was anything but dry for European companies. This burst of activity signals more than a funding spike; it invites a deeper look at what Europe’s innovation identity looks like today. Across the continent, there’s a stronger sense that Europe can produce and scale world-class tech companies in its own right, rather than just nurture later-stage spin-offs or see them acquired by U.S. firms.

While the United States still leads in overall startup volume and ecosystem strength, Europe’s recent momentum shows its innovation landscape is maturing and gaining confidence on the global stage.

Europe was already home to over 217 unicorns by late 2025, spread across fintech, AI, enterprise software, and other domains. That’s a milestone for a region whose venture culture has historically leaned toward caution.

What’s notable isn’t simply the number of new billion-dollar companies, but their variety. Gone are the days when a single sector, often generative AI, defined European unicorn trajectories. Here we see cybersecurity, cloud optimisation, defence-oriented software, sustainability data, and education marketplaces all earning top valuations and investor backing.

The broader context matters. In 2025, deep-tech and university spinouts, including companies in aerospace, robotics, materials, sensors, and health sciences, saw near record levels of funding, and many achieved significant valuation or revenue milestones.

This goes hand in hand with a narrative that’s become increasingly clear: European capital is being more deliberate than exuberant. Rather than inflate every trend label, investors are writing checks where traction, revenue models, and regulatory demand converge. That’s why platforms helping companies with compliance and ESG reporting, or infrastructure for cloud efficiency, are winning attention alongside defence-tech innovators.

Europe’s tech ecosystem has matured, even if it still faces hurdles. Venture funding peaked in recent years and then dipped; for example, total European VC investment in 2024 was reported to be around $45 billion, down from earlier highs. Yet the valuation achievements and funding depth remain meaningful.

This apparent paradox highlights a structural shift: rather than broad flows of unfettered capital, funding is now more selective and outcome-oriented. Investors, LPs, and strategic partners are looking for proof of product-market fit, regulatory differentiation, and defensible business models.

Fragmentation across markets and languages, long considered a European challenge, can also be a strength when paired with clusters of domain expertise, cybersecurity hubs in Belgium, deep tech in the Nordics, cloud infrastructure in the Baltics, and education technology with strong ties to diverse EU labour markets. Observers have noted that these clusters are attracting venture dollars, even if not every founder heads straight for the Bay Area.

Policy tools and institutional support are increasingly part of the backdrop for European innovation. The European Union’s research and innovation framework programmes, most notably Horizon Europe, are directing substantial resources toward areas such as digital transformation, strategic autonomy, and industrial competitiveness.

For 2021–2027, Horizon Europe is the EU’s flagship funding programme for research and innovation, with an overall budget of around €93.5 billion allocated to boost competitiveness, address climate and social challenges, and support key technologies from AI to advanced manufacturing.

This support matters because initiatives that might once have felt niche, advanced sensors, ESG compliance tools, or technologies with both civil and defence applications, now align clearly with broader strategic goals set out in the EU’s innovation plans.

Calls under Horizon Europe Cluster 4 – Digital, Industry and Space, and related programmes bring together public and private partners to tackle digital and green transitions, pooling resources and creating coherent pathways from research to commercial deployment.

That’s why this month’s unicorn news feels less like a fluke and more like a phase transition.

So what does it all mean? Are these five new unicorns signs of a sustainable upswing or just a temporary blip in enterprise valuations?

They’re arguably both: an indicator that Europe’s startup engine still runs on thoughtful investment, real use cases, and foundational problems, and a challenge to continue scaling that momentum into later-stage growth and exits.

Europe doesn’t need to be Silicon Valley. It never really did. What it needs is confidence in its own values, disciplined capital, diverse innovation, and regulation as an enabler, not a constraint.

If this is Europe’s tech moment, it’s not marked by headline-grabbing valuations alone. It’s defined by the breadth of problems being solved and the depth of conviction behind those solutions.

            <div id="article-text">G2 has completed a major acquisition by purchasing three of the world’s most influential software discovery platforms from Gartner. The move significantly reshapes the global B2B software reviews market and strengthens G2’s position in how companies evaluate and buy software.

Slush, one of Europe’s most influential tech and startup events, has named Noora Saksa as its new CEO. The leadership change signals a strategic shift toward expanding Slush beyond its annual event and building a year-round global founder platform.

The French government has decided to phase out US-based collaboration tools such as Zoom and Microsoft Teams across public administration. The decision is part of a broader push for European digital sovereignty and reduced reliance on American Big Tech.

This week signals consolidation and sovereignty: G2 reshapes software discovery, Slush enters a new leadership phase, and Europe doubles down on digital independence.

            <div id="article-text">We are all familiar with the subscription economy, and it certainly works as a reminder of the COVID-19 pandemic, when we were all hooked on our TVs watching Netflix or listening to our favorite music artist on Spotify.

Despite how modern it seems to be, the truth is that the subscription economy has been around for some time, surprisingly dating back to around 1800, with the first magazine subscriptions, or the subscriptions for fresh British milk, around 1860.

Over the years, the of subscription-based companies has turned the subscription model into an ideal business strategy since it provides unique benefits. In the same way, the adoption of this model across multiple industries has led to negative repercussions for the general public.

This article explores its growth across industries, benefits and disadvantages, and why this is important for you, as a service provider and/or as a customer.

The subscription economy is a recurring-revenue model in which products or services are delivered daily under a temporary or perpetual subscription in exchange for a fixed price, growing considerably in the last 20 years.

According to the last report in the Subscription Economy Market 2025 by Juniper, the global market had a total revenue of $722B in 2025, with a forecasted total revenue of $1.2T by 2030, with an average annual growth rate of more than 15%. Software as a service (SaaS) remains the biggest part of the subscription market with a revenue of more than $250B by 2022. The car rethinking industry, e-mobility application area, and the digitization of the health sector are expected to be enormously scaled by 2030.

The European market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 17.50% in the forecast period of 2026-2035. The main industry leaders within the region are beauty, food, and digital subscriptions. Whereas the countries where the subscription market stands out are the UK (beauty and personal care), Germany (software and consumer goods), France (food and beverage), and Italy and Spain (digital subscription and other categories).

A study made by Advances in Consumer Research (ACR) journal highlights how this model is great for businesses because it provides steady income, low upfront costs, and consistent lifetime value (the total value a customer provides to a company over their relationship), while promoting brand loyalty. It also offers unique advantages for consumers, such as a customer-centric approach focused on personalizing services, products and experiences, and experiences; convenient, time-saving solutions; cost-effectiveness; access to a diverse range of products rather than ownership of a few; and even social recognition and identity.

The gaming industry had a steady increase after the COVID-19 pandemic, introducing subscription-based services, which have become regular within the industry. The business model is simple: gamers pay a subscription fee to access gaming services, and there are three different options for customers:

The global market for subscription-based gaming was estimated at $10.1B in 2023 and is forecasted to reach $21.3B by 2030, growing at a CAGR of 11.3% from 2023 to 2030.

It has been popularized due to its affordability and convenience, since the subscription to platforms enables players the flexibility to pay multiple games with an affordable fee.

The subscription model also offers unique advantages for companies, such as reduction of upfront costs since the games are directly streamed from servers, promoted by the technological development of high-speed internet infrastructure and 5G, cloud gaming service, cross-platform accounts, family plans, and leveraged AI to offer personalized game recommendations based on user behavior.

Another industry that is adapting to market and customer expectations is healthcare. As a response to technological and societal advancements, subscription medical care is increasing in popularity within the US, expected to reach $15.1bn by 2032.

Health tech represents a great opportunity for individuals and businesses since it introduces cost predictability, personalized attention, and wellness data. Healthcare providers and health tech companies are leveraging the use of AI, since it facilitates the data analysis process, helping health professionals to make more accurate and efficient diagnoses.

Within the health care and health tech industry, there are several subscription-based models, such as:

The subscription economy has expanded to other services, such as education. Since the customer expectations and behavior is demanding accessible, personalized content at an affordable price, the global e-learning market is growing and expected to reach $1T by 2032 with subscription models leading.

The key drivers for growth are the increasing use of VR and AR in e-learning, digital transformation, and the partnership of universities and diversity in offerings. Some of the most used platforms worldwide are Duolingo, Coursera, and FutureLearn, among others.

Another industry that has greatly benefitted with the subscription model is the creator economy. Content creators are increasingly looking to subscription platforms such as Patreon, OnlyFans, and Substack, adopting them as a solution in a volatile economy and competitive markets, where creators heavily depended on paid partnerships and platform payouts, this way ensuring a stable monthly recurring revenue.

The key drivers for the growth of this market are, whatsoever, slightly different than the previously mentioned: audiences want to pay for a deeper relationship with the creator than passive scrolling, whether of its niche expertise or personal connection.

Despite all the unique benefits that the subscription model offers for customers and companies, the quick expansion and adoption of this model has led to negative effects in the audiences, which become challenges for the companies. You may be familiar with the concept of subscription fatigue, which reflects the customers’ reluctance to engage with multiple subscriptions.

This phenomenon was born due to the saturation in the expanding market and is driven by “lack of perceived value, hidden or unpredictable fees and loss of control,” fomenting churn (percentage of customers who cancel their subscription) for customers to save money or just because the service seems not useful for them.

Another challenge for companies is the constant pressure for ongoing investment in product development and customer engagement, especially in industries with minimal product differentiation, such as the streaming platforms industry. High production costs and limited audience engagement increase this model’s financial struggles, adding pressure on companies to deliver valuable services while generating profit.

Subscription models are no longer limited to entertainment platforms. They have become a core part of modern digital business strategies, offering predictable revenue streams for companies and enhancing customer experience.

The next phase will likely combine hybrid subscription models with usage-based pricing and data-driven personalization. To remain competitive, companies will need to adapt to consumer expectations by offering flexible prices and plans, pause options, bundling strategies, and partnerships across platforms.

Ultimately, the main challenge right now is how to design models that deliver long-term value without overwhelming users, balancing profitability with meaningful user experience.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Apple confirmed this week that it has acquired Israeli AI startup Q.ai in a deal valued at close to $2 billion, making it one of the company’s largest acquisitions ever, second only to the $3 billion purchase of Beats in 2014.

But check your assumptions: this isn’t Beats 2.0. There’s no new headphone brand to flex. Instead, Apple is paying top dollar for tech that might let your devices understand you without you ever saying a word.

​​These days we put our phones on silent so they won’t disturb us; soon the phone will put us on silent so it can understand us.

Q.ai has been operating in secrecy since its founding in 2022. Its machine-learning research focuses on interpreting “silent speech”, detecting imperceptible facial micro-movements, and subtle audio cues to infer what someone means to say.

Patents suggest this tech could work in headphones, smart glasses, or other wearables so users can issue commands privately, even in a quiet library.

That future has a decidedly dramatic edge: imagine telling Siri to skip a track or read your messages without ever parting your lips. Apple executives call the acquisition a way to fuse machine learning with next-generation hardware.

Longtime Apple watcher Johny Srouji praised Q.ai as “a remarkable company that is pioneering new and creative ways to use imaging and machine learning.”

At first blush, spending almost $2 billion on not speaking might sound like corporate futurism taken to a comic extreme. We already have voice assistants that sometimes struggle to understand us when we do speak.

Yet here’s Apple’s bet: once devices can interpret faint facial cues, the entire paradigm of human-computer interaction shifts, from keyboards and taps to gestures and barely-audible intentions.

This move also signals how Apple’s AI strategy is evolving. Some critical voices have noted that the company has lagged behind competitors in generative AI and conversational assistants, even partnering with Google to bring Gemini-powered features into its ecosystem. Acquiring Q.ai suggests Cupertino isn’t just chasing language models; it wants to redefine the interface itself.

There’s a strange poetry to this. In an era when every tech giant is clamouring to make their AI chatty, Apple is buying a company that may prime its devices to be less vocal, more intuitive, and perhaps eerily discreet.

It’s the sort of paradox that defines modern tech: a quieter future might demand the loudest investment.

If this sounds like science fiction, well, it does. But Q.ai’s technology, as described in recent reports, could translate into features in AirPods, Vision Pro headsets, or future wearables as soon as 2027. Could it help Siri finally feel less like a confused concierge and more like an unseen assistant tuned to your intent? That remains to be seen.

Either way, Apple’s big wager on silent speech reminds us that innovation doesn’t always roar. Sometimes, it listens for the quietest signals and pays dearly for them.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">G2, the Chicago-based software insights platform, agreed today to acquire three prominent software review and discovery properties from Gartner: Capterra, Software Advice, and GetApp.

The deal brings four of the largest B2B review sites under a single roof and signals a shift toward unified, AI-driven software recommendation and buying experiences.

According to the announcement, the combined business will include roughly six million verified customer reviews and tap into an audience of more than 200 million annual software buyers. G2 said it expects the transaction to close in the first quarter of 2026, subject to standard regulatory and closing conditions.

G2’s leadership frames the agreement as a response to fragmentation in the software buying journey. By consolidating multiple review databases and audiences, the company aims to streamline discovery for buyers and expand demand-generation tools for vendors.

A workspace designed for growth, collaboration, and endless networking opportunities in the heart of tech.

In a public post, G2’s CEO described the integration as building “the trusted data foundation for B2B software in the age of AI,” with deeper buyer intent signals and a more consistent taxonomy across categories.

For buyers, the enlarged platform promises easier access to user-verified feedback and faster decision cycles. For software vendors, the unified dataset could translate into broader visibility and enhanced market insights.

G2’s roadmap includes tighter AI integration across search and recommendation workflows.

Gartner, which currently owns Capterra, Software Advice, and GetApp, has held these properties for years as part of its digital markets portfolio.

This divestiture appears to reflect a strategic choice to focus its core research and advisory business while enabling specialized review platforms to evolve under a dedicated marketplace operator.

As the software market continues to expand, the consolidation of review infrastructure under G2 could reshape how products are evaluated and purchased.

The market will watch closely for how the combined entity leverages its scale to influence search visibility and buyer influence metrics in 2026 and beyond.
