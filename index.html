            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2026/01/apple-introduces-new-airtag-with-better-range-and-a-louder-speaker/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Apple is introducing a new version of its AirTag tracking device—simply dubbed “the new AirTag&quot;—and claims it offers substantial improvements thanks to a new Bluetooth chip.

The original AirTag came out five years ago now, and it became popular in a variety of contexts. There were some problems, though—there was real concern about unwanted tracking and stalking with the devices, based on real stories of it being used for that. The company gradually introduced new features and protections against that, getting it to a much better place.

This new version is focused on making the device more effective in general. Thanks to the inclusion of the second-generation Ultra Wideband chip (the same one found in other recently released Apple devices like the iPhone 17), Apple says the new AirTag can work with the Precision Finding feature in the Find My app to direct users to the AirTag (and whatever lost item it’s stored with or attached to) from up to 50 percent farther away.

Additionally, the speaker in the AirTag is now 50 percent louder, Apple says. These two things together address some user complaints that, as useful as an AirTag can be in ideal circumstances, sometimes it is frustrating trying to get things just right to find something. It won’t eliminate all edge cases, but it ought to help.

Apple used this announcement to also talk up some of the features of the AirTag, including the encryption that it says prevents anyone but the AirTag owner from using it, and an arrangement with airlines where users can temporarily give airlines the ability to use Apple’s network to find a specific AirTag to locate lost luggage and the like.

To be clear, the new AirTag doesn’t introduce any major new features that aren’t already offered in the previous generation—this is just an update to the device’s accuracy, volume, and range.

The price remains unchanged, at $29 for one AirTag or $99 for a pack of four. The new model is available for order on Apple’s website now and will hit physical stores later this week.</div>

            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2026/01/wildly-irresponsible-dots-use-of-ai-to-draft-safety-rules-sparks-concerns/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The US Department of Transportation apparently thinks it’s a good idea to use artificial intelligence to draft rules impacting the safety of airplanes, cars, and pipelines, a ProPublica investigation revealed Monday.

It could be a problem if DOT becomes the first agency to use AI to draft rules, ProPublica pointed out, since AI is known to confidently get things wrong and hallucinate fabricated information. Staffers fear that any failure to catch AI errors could result in flawed laws, leading to lawsuits, injuries, or even deaths in the transportation system.

But the DOT’s top lawyer, Gregory Zerzan, isn’t worried about that, December meeting notes revealed, because the point isn’t for AI to be perfect. It’s for AI to help speed up the rulemaking process, so that rules that take weeks or months to draft can instead be written within 30 days. According to Zerzan, DOT’s preferred tool, Google Gemini, can draft rules in under 30 minutes.

“We don’t need the perfect rule on XYZ,” Zerzan told DOT staffers at the meeting. “We don’t even need a very good rule on XYZ. We want good enough.”

ProPublica spoke to experts and granted six DOT staffers anonymity to discuss their concerns about DOT’s use of Google Gemini to draft rules.

Some experts who monitor AI use in government told ProPublica that DOT could save time using Gemini as a research assistant “with plenty of supervision and transparency.” For example, at a presentation, DOT staffers were told that “most of what goes into the preambles of DOT regulatory documents is just ‘word salad,’” and “Gemini can do word salad.”

However, staffers told ProPublica they felt “deeply skeptical” that Gemini was up to the task. They emphasized that DOT rulemaking is “intricate work” requiring sometimes decades of “expertise in the subject at hand as well as in existing statutes, regulations, and case law.” Likely unsettling staffers further, ProPublica noted that a demonstration of Gemini’s rule-drafting produced a document missing key text, which a staffer would then have to fill in. Additionally, the DOT’s move comes after a year of AI hallucinations scrambling courts, with many lawyers fined and even judges admitting they can be fooled by fabricated information.

Any errors in the rules could have serious consequences. These rules “touch virtually every facet of transportation safety,” keeping “airplanes in the sky,” preventing “gas pipelines from exploding,” and stopping “freight trains carrying toxic chemicals from skidding off the rails,” ProPublica reported.

“It seems wildly irresponsible,” one staffer said.

Despite staffers’ concerns, DOT appears to be racing forward with the plan, ProPublica reported. The department has already used Gemini to draft a “still-unpublished Federal Aviation Administration rule, according to a DOT staffer briefed on the matter.”

Donald Trump has urged federal agencies to adopt AI at a rapid pace, but nowhere in his orders has the president pushed for AI to draft laws, ProPublica noted.

However, Trump is “very excited” about the DOT initiative, Zerzan told staffers at the meeting, suggesting that Trump sees DOT as the “point of the spear” and expects other agencies to follow its lead.

At DOT, Trump likely hopes to see many rules quickly updated to modernize airways and roadways. In a report highlighting the Office of Science and Technology Policy’s biggest “wins” in 2025, the White House credited DOT with “replacing decades-old rules with flexible, innovation-friendly frameworks,” including fast-tracking rules to allow for more automated vehicles on the roads.

Right now, DOT expects that Gemini can be relied on to “handle 80 to 90 percent of the work of writing regulations,” ProPublica reported. Eventually all federal workers who rely on AI tools like Gemini to draft rules “would fall back into merely an oversight role, monitoring ‘AI-to-AI interactions,’” ProPublica reported.

Google did not respond to Ars’ request to comment on this use case for Gemini, which could spread across government under Trump’s direction.

Instead, the tech giant posted a blog on Monday, pitching Gemini for government more broadly, promising federal workers that AI would help with “creative problem-solving to the most critical aspects of their work.”

Google has been competing with AI rivals for government contracts, undercutting OpenAI and Anthropic’s $1 deals by offering a year of access to Gemini for $0.47.

The DOT contract seems important to Google. In a December blog, the company celebrated that DOT was “the first cabinet-level agency to fully transition its workforce away from legacy providers to Google Workspace with Gemini.”

At that time, Google suggested this move would help DOT “ensure the United States has the safest, most efficient, and modern transportation system in the world.”

Immediately, Google encouraged other federal leaders to launch their own efforts using Gemini.

“We are committed to supporting the DOT’s digital transformation and stand ready to help other federal leaders across the government adopt this blueprint for their own mission successes,” Google’s blog said.

DOT did not immediately respond to Ars’ request for comment.</div>

            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-01-26</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2026/01/how-to-encrypt-your-pcs-disk-without-giving-the-keys-to-microsoft/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">In early 2025, Forbes reports, investigators at the FBI served Microsoft with a warrant seeking the BitLocker encryption recovery keys for several laptops it believed held evidence of fraud in Guam’s COVID-19 unemployment assistance program. And Microsoft complied with the FBI’s request.

BitLocker is the name of the full-disk encryption technology that has been part of Windows for nearly two decades. Though initially only available to owners of the Pro editions of Windows who turned it on manually, during the Windows 8 era Microsoft began using BitLocker to encrypt local disks automatically for all Windows 11 Home and Pro PCs that signed in with a Microsoft account. Using BitLocker in this way also uploads a recovery key for your device to Microsoft’s servers—this makes it possible to unlock your disk so you don’t lose data if something goes wrong with your system, or if you install a CPU upgrade or some other hardware change that breaks BitLocker. But it also (apparently) makes it possible for Microsoft to unlock your disk, too.

A Microsoft rep said that the company handled “around 20” similar BitLocker recovery key requests from government authorities per year, and that these requests often fail because users haven’t stored their recovery keys on Microsoft’s servers. Microsoft and other tech companies have generally refused requests to install universal encryption backdoors for law enforcement purposes, and some companies (like Apple) claim to store device encryption keys using another layer of encryption that renders the keys inaccessible to the company.

But storing your device’s recovery keys in someone else’s cloud can still represent a privacy and security risk, especially at a time when the US government has become more interested in targeting journalists and the Trump administration’s political opponents.

If you want to encrypt your Windows PC’s disk but you don’t want to store your recovery key with Microsoft, you do have options. We’ll recap the requirements, as well as the steps you’ll need to take.

Before we begin: Disk encryption is one of the handful of differences between the Home and Pro versions of Windows.

Both the Home and Pro versions of Windows support disk encryption, but only the Pro versions give users full control over the process. The Home version of Windows only supports disk encryption when logged in with a Microsoft account and will only offer to store your encryption key on Microsoft’s servers.

To access the full version of BitLocker and back up your own recovery key, you’ll need to upgrade to the Pro version of Windows. Microsoft offers its own first-party upgrade option through the Microsoft Store for a one-time fee of $99, but it’s also possible to bring your own product key and upgrade yourself. This Macworld-affiliated listing from StackCommerce claims to be an official Microsoft partner and is offering a Windows 11 Pro key for just $10, though your mileage with third-party key resellers may vary.

However you get it, once you have a valid key, open Settings, then System, then Activation, click upgrade your edition of Windows, click change product key, and then enter your Windows 11 Pro key (Windows 10 Pro keys should also work, if you already have one). Luckily, changing Windows editions doesn’t require anything more disruptive than a system restart. You won’t need to reinstall Windows, and you shouldn’t lose any of your installed apps or data.

And once you’ve upgraded a PC to Windows 11 Pro once, you should be able to reinstall and activate Windows 11 Pro on that system again any time you want without having to re-enter your product key. Keep the product key stored somewhere, though, just in case you do need to use it for a reinstall, or if you ever need to re-activate Windows after a hardware upgrade.

Once you’ve got Windows 11 Pro set up, it’s time to either encrypt or re-encrypt your disk.

If you’ve signed in with a Microsoft account, your disk is likely already encrypted, and the key is likely already stored on Microsoft’s servers. If this is the case, this process will actually involve fully unencrypting and re-encrypting your drive, which can take an hour or two depending on the speed of your PC and the size of your drive.

Here’s how to check your current encryption status and the steps to follow if you’ve already got a key backed up with Microsoft:

Once your disk is re-encrypted, your PC should work just as it did before. The actual encryption technology hasn’t changed at all—all we’ve done is change where the recovery key is saved.

This does put the burden on the user if and when it comes time to use your recovery key. You’ll have to remember where you put it and not get it mixed up with any other recovery keys you’ve stored for other PCs or old Windows installations. But for anyone concerned about Microsoft giving their device’s encryption keys to the government or anyone else with a valid subpoena, the extra hassle may be worth it in exchange for the added privacy and peace of mind.</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Universal Pictures and Illumination dropped a new trailer for the upcoming Super Mario Galaxy Movie, and gaming fans will no doubt be delighted at the news that Yoshi, the little green dinosaur, features prominently, along with plenty of other Easter eggs for sharp-eyed fans.

As previously reported, the first attempt at a Super Mario movie adaptation in 1993 was notoriously a dismal failure, although it still has its ’90s-nostalgic fans. But 2023’s Super Mario Bros. Movie won over gaming fans who were skeptical about another adaptation—including Ars Senior Gaming Editor Kyle Orland.

The 2023 film reintroduced Mario and Luigi, two tight-knit but struggling Brooklyn plumbers who got separated when they unexpectedly fell into the fantastical Mushroom Kingdom. Mario sought Princess Peach’s help to rescue his brother from the evil clutches of Bowser, ruler of the Dark Lands, who was keen to marry Peach and threatened to destroy the Mushroom Kingdom with a Super Star if she refused him. So Peach led Mario on a quest to recruit allies and stop Bowser for good. They succeeded, shrinking Bowser and imprisoning him in a jar. Mario and Luigi moved to the Mushroom Kingdom and continued their plumbing work there.

The main voice cast is returning for the sequel: Chris Pratt as Mario, Charlie Day as Luigi, Anya Taylor-Joy as Princess Peach, Jack Black as Bowser, Keegan-Michael Key as the anthropomorphic mushroom Toad, and Kevin Michael Richardson as Bowser’s advisor and informant Kamek. We’re also getting two new cast members: Brie Larson as Princess Rosalina, protector of the cosmos and the Lumas, and Benny Safdie as Bowser, Jr., Bowser’s son and heir to the throne. Directors Aaron Horvath and Michael Jelenic are also back, as is screenwriter Matthew Fogel.

Details on the actual plot are fuzzy, but the first trailer (released last November) focused on Bowser and Bowser Jr., who seemed intent on freeing his dad and (one assumes) taking revenge on the brothers. This latest trailer shows Mario and Luigi at the scene of a “troubled” pipe in the desert of San Kingdom, populated by the sombrero-wearing Tostarenans. When they clear away some rubble covering an opening, who should be lurking inside but Yoshi—not a monster to hit with fire flowers, but a friendly green dinosaur. Yoshi is keen to join the team, although Toad seems less than impressed.

The Super Mario Galaxy Movie hits theaters on April 1, 2026.</div>

“Since yesterday we’ve been working to restore our services following a power outage at a US data center impacting TikTok and other apps we operate,” the TikTok USDS Joint Venture posted on X on Monday morning. “We’re working with our data center partner to stabilize our service. We’re sorry for this disruption and hope to resolve it soon.”

A DownDetector report tracking outages showed problems began early Sunday morning, with the majority of problems seemingly resolved by early Monday. However, The Verge reported that some US users continue to experience issues, including issues logging in, long delays uploading videos, generic content flooding For You pages, problems accessing comments, and other issues.

It’s clear that the TikTok USDS Joint Venture is still working to resolve problems connected to the power outage. But their decision to remain silent while the app got buggy during the first weekend under the control of right-wing US owners hand-picked by Donald Trump sparked conspiracy theories on social media that the app had begun censoring left-leaning users.

As the app comes back online, users have also taken note that TikTok is collecting more of their data under US control. As Wired reported, TikTok asked US users to agree to a new terms of service and privacy policy, which allows TikTok to potentially collect “more detailed information about its users, including precise location data.”

“Before this update, the app did not collect the precise, GPS-derived location data of US users,” Wired reported. “Now, if you give TikTok permission to use your phone’s location services, then the app may collect granular information about your exact whereabouts.”

New policies also pushed users to agree to share all their AI interactions, which allows TikTok to store their metadata and trace AI inputs back to specific accounts.

Already seeming more invasive and less reliable, for TikTok users, questions likely remain how much their favorite app might change under new ownership, as the TikTok USDS Joint Venture prepares to retrain the app’s algorithm.

Trump has said that he wants to see the app become “100 percent MAGA,” prompting fears that “For You” pages might soon be flooded with right-wing content or that leftist content like anti-ICE criticism might be suppressed. And The Information reported in July that transferring millions of users over to the US-trained app is expected to cause more “technical issues.”</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Over the years, hackers and modders at large have made it their mission to port classic first-person shooter Doom to practically anything with a display. Recently, though, coder Arin Sarkisan has taken the “Can it Run Doom?” idea in an unlikely direction: wireless earbuds that aren’t designed to output graphics at all.

To be clear, this hack doesn’t apply to any generic set of earbuds. The “Doombuds” project is designed specifically for the PineBuds Pro, which are unique in featuring completely open source firmware and a community-maintained SDK.

That means Sarkisan was able to code up a JavaScript interface that uses the earbuds’ UART contact pads to send a heavily compressed MJPEG video stream to a web server (via a serial server). The 2.4 MB/s data stream from the UART connection can put out about 22 to 27 frames per second in this format, which is more than enough for a CPU that can only run the game at a maximum of 18 fps anyway.

Squeezing the entirety of Doom onto modern earbuds wasn’t an easy task, either. The 4.2MB of game data won’t quite fit on the PineBuds’ 4MB of flash memory, for instance. That means the project needed to use a 1.7MB “squashware” build of Doom, which eliminates some animation frames and shortens some music tracks to make the game even more portable.

The earbuds also have just under 1MB of RAM, requiring the coding of a new version of the game that optimizes away many of the bits that usually fill up a full 4MB of RAM in the standard game. “Pre-generating lookup tables, making variables const, reading const variables from flash, disabling DOOM’s caching system, removing unneeded variables… it all adds up,” Sarkisan writes.

For those without their own PineBuds to test this wild idea, Sarkisan has set up an interactive Twitch stream that players can queue up to control for 45-second sessions via doombuds.com. It’s a great little break-time diversion, especially for people ready to marvel that a set of $70 earbuds can now run a game that required a $1,000-plus computer tower a few decades ago.</div>

            <h2>Tesla Kills Autopilot After Storm of Criticism, Paywalls Basic Features</h2>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The concept for Tesla’s driver-assistance system, Autopilot, has been around for well over a decade. Elon Musk’s EV maker has long used the term to describe features like advanced cruise control and auto-steer, all the while admitting that drivers still need to be able to take over at any time.

But in light of plummeting sales and shrinking profits, Tesla has killed the feature in the United States and Canada for good. It’s a major reversal after over a decade of Musk making yearly — and flat-out wrong — predictions of achieving fully autonomous, or Level 5, driving “next year.”

Autopilot has also been caught up in several high-profile investigations by federal regulators, following hundreds of crashes and dozens of deaths involving the feature. The EV maker has also faced a litany of lawsuits over the software, including a $329 million wrongful death settlement last year.

To raise much-needed revenue now that car sales have taken a major hit, the company has instead paywalled most of the basic features. Starting on February 14, Tesla owners will need to shell out a steep $99 a month to enable features like autosteer or advanced lane keep assist, something the vehicles were previously capable of without a subscription. (Traffic Aware Cruise Control, however, will remain standard, even without a subscription.)

The timing is suspect, to say the least. As Ars Technica points out, a court ruled in December that Tesla deceived its customers by implying that its “Autopilot” branding amounts to “deceptive marketing,” giving the company a mere 60 days to fix any misleading claims or be banned from selling cars in California, one of its biggest markets.

The start of the subscription service almost perfectly aligns with that deadline, although it remains unclear what exactly motivated the company to kill Autopilot. Another major motivating factor may be Musk’s $1 trillion pay package, which requires the company to reach 10 million active subscriptions to its driver assistance software.

Tesla’s branding for the features has been especially confusing as of late, differentiating between Autopilot and “Full Self-Driving” (FSD), a highly controversial and easily fooled add-on package that also still requires the driver to stay engaged at all times, despite its misleading name.

As of February 14, owners will only be able to either pay $99 a month for an FSD subscription — or live with the fact that their vehicles’ driver assistance capabilities will be considerably reined in. Before that date, users can still shell out a steep $8,000 to permanently unlock FSD.

Musk has boasted that it’s an incredible value add — and one that’s going to become even more expensive as time goes on.

“I should also mention that the $99/month for supervised FSD will rise as FSD’s capabilities improve,” Musk warned in a January 22 tweet. “The massive value jump is when you can be on your phone or sleeping for the entire ride (unsupervised FSD).”

When such an “unsupervised” version of FSD will materialize remains a mystery. However, given Musk’s track record of making predictions about the tech, such a future may still be many years out — if it ever materializes.

            <div id="article-text">If you thought humanity already had its hands full with climate change, think again.

With satellites and space junk increasingly cluttering our planet’s low Earth orbit, a team of scientists warn that this entire region could suddenly collapse into a destructive maelstrom of swirling debris, posing a threat to any spacecraft that dares to venture up there, and hurling dangerous missiles of space junk down onto our planet below.

Their study, which is yet-to-be-peer reviewed, builds on a theoretical scenario first laid out by NASA scientist Donald Kessler, which describes how just a few accidental collisions between satellites could quickly cascade into a vicious cycle in which the resulting debris causes even more smash-ups, and thus even more debris. At worst, the ensuing vortex of dangerous debris could trap us on our planet and set back spaceflight for decades.

With more satellites being launched into low Earth orbit than ever, this scenario — dubbed Kessler syndrome — is starting to be considered as a serious possibility. Elon Musk’s SpaceX alone maintains a “megaconstellation” of over 9,000 expendable satellites, with Amazon set to follow suit with its own megaconstellation and China working on yet another.

Kessler originally envisioned this orbital catastrophe unfolding over many years. But the new work adds a grim twist to the mix. What if a Kessler syndrome type scenario was suddenly kicked off by a violent solar storm? These outbursts by the Sun blast the Earth with electromagnetic waves that can disrupt electrical grids and communications. In theory, a powerful enough one could cut off our contact with satellites and fry their navigation systems, leaving them with no means to stay on course.

It’s a concerning possibility. With all that stuff up there, SpaceX’s expendable satellites have to constantly perform maneuvers to avoid hitting each other and other objects, with over 300,000 of these maneuvers performed last year.

Investigating this possibility, the researchers created a new metric called the CRASH clock, which measures how long it would take a catastrophic collision to occur if the satellites lose navigation in a crisis like a solar storm.

The gist is that things would go south very quickly. The researchers calculated that satellites may be having a “close approach,” or pass within one kilometer of each other, once every 36 seconds in low Earth orbit — an uncomfortably close distance in space.

Factoring that in, they put the CRASH clock at just 5.5 days, meaning that humanity would have very little time to intervene if this solar storm did occur. On the other hand, if we were struck by a solar event of this magnitude — like the infamous Carrington Event in 1859, which took out the planet’s burgeoning telegraph infrastructure and today would likely cause blackouts the world over— we would probably have more immediate concerns to worry about.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Experts have long questioned president Donald Trump’s claims of having a clean bill of health. He has been spotted with swollen ankles and dark bruises on both of his hands, which experts argue could be a sign that he’s receiving frequent intravenous treatments.

His mental acuity has also been called into question, with critics pointing to his slurred speech, nonsensical rants, and lapses in memory.

Case in point, in a recently published interview with New York Magazine, Trump struggled to recall the name of Alzheimer’s disease — a particularly dark blunder, considering the condition is characterized by progressive memory loss, and Trump has a family history of it.

When discussing his father, Fred Trump, he struggled to remember what the disease was called.

“He had one problem. At a certain age, about 86, 87, he started getting… what do they call it?” he pondered during the video.

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt came to his rescue.

“Like an Alzheimer’s thing,” the president continued. “Well, I don’t have it.”

When asked if the disease is “something you think about at all,” Trump was vehement in his denial, but once again struggled to sound coherent.

“No, I don’t think about it at all,” he said. “You know why? Because whatever it is, my attitude is whatever.”

Swirling questions about Trump’s cognitive condition have clearly frustrated the 79-year-old. During baffling remarks from the Oval Office earlier this month, made after signing a bipartisan Whole Milk for Healthy Kids Act, Trump boasted that a penchant for dairy had allowed him to “ace” all of his cognitive tests.

“I’ve aced every one of them because I drink milk,” he said.

He also boasted about passing cognitive tests on January 2 and December 9, suggesting that his neurological condition has been evaluated frequently in recent months. (He’s discussed the topic for years now, claiming to have achieved a top score on the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), a 30-point cognitive screening tool to detect cognitive impairment, back in 2018.)

Also concerning is his family history. Fred Trump died at the age of 93 in 1999, after struggling with the disease for almost a decade.

Adding to Trump’s optics conundrum around his health, his top staff often defends his physical and mental health in terms so strong that it can be unintentionally comical.

Leavitt, for instance, insisted to NY Mag that the “Marine sentries who stand outside the Oval Office, they had to request more staff and bring up more Marines because the president is in the Oval Office so much.”

“They’ve never had to do that before,” she said. “They had to request more guys to stand by the door because they are running out of men to fill the shifts.”

“He’s working harder now than he did in his entire life,” she told the magazine. “Even in real estate when he was on top of the world in New York.”

            <h2>Scientists Investigating 2,000-Year-Old Artifact That Appears to Be a Battery</h2>
            <p><strong>Futurism | 2026-01-26</strong></p>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">A 2,000 year old battery, or just a very interesting pot?

This is the debate that’s been swirling over the fragments of a puzzling artifact discovered in Iraq nearly a century ago. Dubbed the “Baghdad battery,” it’s believed to have originally been a clay jar housing a copper vessel, at the center of which was an iron rod. This arrangement, either by coincidence or design, could’ve allowed it to function as a primitive galvanic cell, some archaeologists argue — a primitive energy storage device pioneered in the Western world by Alessandro Volta, after whom the “volt” was named.

These are tough claims to bear out, not least of all because the original artifact has been lost since the US’s invasion of Iraq in 2003. As such, archaeologists have had to rely on reconstructing the strange vessel based on records to try to tease out its origins.

Now a new study highlighted by Chemistry World purports that the Baghdad battery wasn’t just a battery, but one that was capable of outputting much more power than once believed.

“If this artefact were truly a battery — and I could be wrong of course — then my experiment shows the most effective and convenient way it could have been used as one,” the author, independent researcher Alexander Bazes, told the outlet.

Skeptics argue that the artifact, in its suspected arrangement, would’ve outputted too puny an amount of power to have intentionally been a battery.

Bazes’s reconstruction argues otherwise. His experiments suggests that the clay jar’s porous exterior acted like a separator between an electrolyte, perhaps lye, and air, which connected with the copper vessel to create an outer cell. Meanwhile, the iron rod inside the copper vessel acted as an inner cell, creating an electrical series that could’ve produced 1.4 volts of electricity — approximately the same voltage of a modern AA battery.

Still, Bazes doesn’t buy the argument purported by some fringe archaeologists that the battery’s copper vessel would’ve been used to electroplate jewelry, or coat them in a thin layer of metal. Instead, he argues the Baghdad battery may have been used to “ritually corrode” prayers written on paper, as witnessing the corrosion would’ve been seen as “visual evidence of an energetic influence having passed through their prayer,” Bazes wrote in the study.

Or maybe it wasn’t a battery at all, counters University of Pennsylvania archaeologist William Hafford, who has extensively researched the artifact. In reality, it was likely a sacred jar for storing prayers, he told Chemistry World, noting that other magic items like it have been found buried nearby, including a similar clay jar with ten copper vessels, which is obviously too many to form a battery. The iron rod that supposedly acted as an electrode for the inner battery cell were really just iron nails that were part of the magical ritual.

“You would drop the prayer through the neck of the jar, seal it with bitumen and then bury it with a ritual,” Hafford told the outlet. “They were usually buried in the ground because you were giving them to the chthonic deities.”

            <div id="article-text">As much of North America is still recovering from a devastating winter storm over the weekend, other parts of the globe have already been through much worse.

Consider the Kamchatka Peninsula, a Russian territory that reaches into the Pacific Ocean north-east of Japan, which has been battling with record amounts of snow this winter. On January 16 alone, a small city on the peninsula’s southern coast, called Petropavlovsk-Kamchatskiy, experienced a baffling five and a half feet of snow, effectively burying local residents and their cars completely. Some areas saw more than six and a half feet in just the first half of January.

One video that went viral on social media last week shows a local resident jumping out of his window several stories up, only to land in a deep blanket of snow below. A time-lapse recorded by a CCTV camera shows entire cars being buried in a matter of hours, forcing residents to shovel narrow channels just to get down the block.

According to the Russian state-operated news agency RIA Novosti, it was the most snowfall in the peninsula the Kamchatka hydrometeorology department has seen in about 60 years. Satellite images highlighted by NASA show the peninsula being buried by snow, turning it into a white snowball that can easily be spotted from space.

Yet as the New York Times reports, AI-generated videos have added to the confusion, showing unrealistic apocalyptic scenes. One fake clip, for instance, shows residents sliding down massive ramps of snow that reach the top of ten-story apartment blocks.

Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky local Andrey Stepanchuk told the NYT that many of the videos circulating online were not real, describing the situation as “nothing catastrophic.”

Apart from record amounts of snow, the region had to deal with other kinds of natural disasters as well. After all, per NASA, it’s the most volcanically active region in the entire world.

Case in point, Kamchatka was struck by a magnitude 8.8 earthquake last summer, the sixth largest on record since 1900. Just weeks later, the Krasheninnikov volcano near the east coast erupted for the first time in “at least 400 years.”

In short, Kamchatka’s experiences with the brute force of Mother Nature really put the latest snowstorm blanketing much of the United States and Canada into perspective.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Generative AI relies on a massive body of training material, primarily made up of human-authored content haphazardly scraped from the internet.

Scientists are still trying to better understand what will happen when these AI models run out of that content and have to rely on synthetic, AI-generated data instead, closing a potentially dangerous loop. Studies have found that AI models start cannibalizing this AI-generated data, which can eventually turn their neural networks into mush. As the AI iterates on recycled content, it starts to spit out increasingly bland and often mangled outputs.

There’s also the question of what will happen to human culture as AI systems digest and produce AI content ad infinitum. As AI executives promise that their models are capable enough to replace creative jobs, what will future models be trained on?

In an insightful new study published in the journal Patterns this month, an international team of researchers found that a text-to-image generator, when linked up with an image-to-text system and instructed to iterate over and over again, eventually converges on “very generic-looking images” they dubbed “visual elevator music.”

“This finding reveals that, even without additional training, autonomous AI feedback loops naturally drift toward common attractors,” they wrote. “Human-AI collaboration, rather than fully autonomous creation, may be essential to preserve variety and surprise in the increasingly machine-generated creative landscape.”

As Rutgers University professor of computer science Ahmed Elgammal writes in an essay about the work for The Conversation, it’s yet another piece of evidence that generative AI may already be inducing a state of “cultural stagnation.”

The recent study shows that “generative AI systems themselves tend toward homogenization when used autonomously and repeatedly,” he argued. “They even suggest that AI systems are currently operating in this way by default.”

“The convergence to a set of bland, stock images happened without retraining,” Elgammal added. “No new data was added. Nothing was learned. The collapse emerged purely from repeated use.”

It’s a particularly alarming predicament considering the tidal wave of AI slop drowning out human-made content on the internet. While proponents of AI argue that humans will always be the “final arbiter of creative decisions,” per Elgammal, algorithms are already starting to float AI-generated content to the top, a homogenization that could greatly hamper creativity.

“The risk is not only that future models might train on AI-generated content, but that AI-mediated culture is already being filtered in ways that favor the familiar, the describable and the conventional,” the researcher wrote.

It remains to be seen to what degree existing creative outlets, from photography to theater, will be affected by the advent of generative AI, or whether they can coexist peacefully.

Nonetheless, it’s an alarming trend that needs to be addressed. Elgammal argued that to stop this process of cultural stagnation, AI models need to be encouraged or incentivized to “deviate from the norms.”

“If generative AI is to enrich culture rather than flatten it, I think systems need to be designed in ways that resist convergence toward statistically average outputs,” he concluded. “The study makes one thing clear: Absent these interventions, generative AI will continue to drift toward mediocre and uninspired content.”

            <div id="article-text">To understand the stance of an unwavering Trump loyalist after United States Custom and Enforcement shocked the nation this weekend by shooting another American citizen in Minneapolis, look no further than Khosla Ventures partner Keith Rabois.

Rabois’ public support for ICE’s actions in the killing of Alex Pretti, made via posts on X, was so vehement that Khosla Ventures partner Ethan Choi and firm founder Vinod Khosla both publicly disavowed it.

Rabois argued that Pretti was at fault, writing that the protester was committing a “felony.” One of Rabois’ posts said, “[N]o law enforcement has shot an innocent person. [I[llegals are committing violent crimes every day.” Another said: “[H]e unequivocally attempted to draw his weapon. [F]uck you.” In another post that discussed citizens’ ability to exercise their First, Second and Fourth Amendment rights, the VC responded weighed in to write: “[Y]es but interfering w a law enforcement operation is not protected by any of those amendments.”

Among other comments, Rabois went on to say he doesn’t believe that the Minneapolis police could be credible sources in an investigation. “[I] don’t think you should ask any law enforcement in MN. But i am very open to reading views from any other urban jurisdiction.” He instead blamed the city’s police for the situation. “Because the MN police’s refusal to cooperate is exactly what is leading to these treacherous conditions (for everyone).”

X reacted as you might expect. Other Trump supporters cheered Rabois on, while those who condemn ICE’s actions argued with and condemned the investor.

The situation spiraled so much that when one person suggested that founders remove Khosla from their cap tables altogether, Khosla partner Choi piped up to distance himself.

Choi posted: “I want to make it clear that Keith doesn’t represent everyone’s views here at @khoslaventures, at least not mine. What happened in Minnesota is plain wrong. Don’t know how you could really see it differently. Sad to see a person’s life taken unnecessarily.”

Then the founder of the firm, Khosla himself, stood by Choi. “I agree with @EthanChoi7 . Macho ICE vigilantes running [amok] empowered by a conscious-less administration,” he said in his post on X.

I agree with @EthanChoi7 . Macho ICE vigilantes running amuck empowered by a conscious-less administration. The video was sickening to watch and the storytelling without facts or with invented fictitious facts by authorities almost unimaginable in a civilized society. ICE… https://t.co/ASvjZQB0Gg

Under normal circumstances, opposing political points of view can be a strength for a VC firm. Whatever anyone thinks of Rabois’ politics, he’s been a very successful investor backing such companies as DoorDash, Affirm, Faire, and Stripe, as well as co-founding Opendoor, among other startups.

But sometimes they are internally disruptive.

Sequoia was embroiled in a controversy over partner Shaun Maguire’s comments attacking New York City mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani. Maguire (whose comments over the weekend on ICE align with Rabois’) remains as an investor at Sequoia. But its leader at the time of the Mamdani controversy, Roelof Botha, stepped down as senior steward in November. Botha was replaced by Alfred Lin and Pat Grady (neither of whom weighed in over the weekend).

In this case, the rift between Khosla partners spilled out publicly. But note that Khosla did not directly chastise Rabois. (The company did not respond to our request for comment.)

When Khosla Ventures re-hired Rabois in 2024, the firm knew it was bringing in an outspoken, self-proclaimed “contrarian” into its ranks, of the ilk that liked to blame the “woke” and praise President Trump. For Rabois’ part, he knew he would be working for a vocal Trump critic (Vinod Khosla has made his point of view on Trump very clear for years).

Will there be continued fallout? Perhaps — but only if founders really do start dumping Khosla Ventures from their cap tables.

            <h2>YouTubers sue Snap for alleged copyright infringement in training its AI models</h2>
            <p><strong>TechCrunch | 2026-01-26</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/26/youtubers-sue-snap-for-alleged-copyright-infringement-in-training-its-ai-models/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">A group of YouTubers who are suing tech giants for scraping their videos without permission to train AI models has now added Snap to their list of defendants. The plaintiffs — internet content creators behind a trio of YouTube channels with roughly 6.2 million collective subscribers — allege that Snap has trained its AI systems on their video content for use in AI features like the app’s “Imagine Lens,” which allows users to edit images using text prompts.

The plaintiffs earlier filed similar lawsuits against Nvidia, Meta, and ByteDance over similar matters.

In the newly filed proposed class action suit, filed on Friday in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California, the YouTubers specifically call out Snap for its use of a large-scale, video-language data set known as HD-VILA-100M, and others that were designed for only academic and research purposes. To use these datasets for commercial purposes, the plaintiffs claim Snap circumvented YouTube’s technological restrictions, terms of service, and licensing limitations, which prohibit commercial use.

The suit is seeking statutory damages and a permanent injunction to stop the alleged copyright infringement going forward.

The case itself is being led by the creators behind the h3h3 YouTube channel, with 5.52 million subscribers, and the smaller golfing channels MrShortGame Golf and Golfoholics.

It’s now one of many lawsuits pitting content creators against AI model providers, which have included copyright disputes from publishers, authors, newspapers, user-generated content sites, artists, and more. It’s also not the first case to hail from a YouTuber. According to the non-profit organization Copyright Alliance, over 70 copyright infringement cases have been filed against AI companies.

In some cases, like one between Meta and a group of authors, a judge has ruled in favor of the tech giant. In others, like the case between Anthropic and a group of authors, the AI giant has settled with and paid out the plaintiffs to resolve their claims. Many cases are still in active litigation.

Snap was asked for comment. TechCrunch will update if one is provided.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">President Donald Trump said he would make countering immigration one of his flagship policies during his second term in the White House, promising an unprecedented number of deportations.

A year in, data shows that deportations by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and Customs and Border Protection have surpassed at least 350,000 people.

ICE has taken center stage in Trump’s mass removal campaign, raiding homes, workplaces, and public parks in search of undocumented people, prompting widespread protests and resistance from communities across the United States.

ICE uses several technologies to identify and surveil individuals. Homeland Security has also leveraged the shadow of Trump’s deportations to challenge long-standing legal norms, including forcibly entering homes to arrest people without a judicial warrant, a move that legal experts say violates the Fourth Amendment protections against unreasonable searches and seizures.

Here are some of the technologies that ICE is relying on.

ICE has a technology known as cell-site simulators to snoop on cellphones. These surveillance devices, as the name suggests, are designed to appear as a cellphone tower, tricking nearby phones into connecting to them. Once that happens, the law enforcement authorities who are using the cell-site simulators can locate and identify the phones in their vicinity, and potentially intercept calls, text messages, and internet traffic.

Cell-site simulators are also known as “stingrays,” based on the brand name of one of the earliest versions of the technology, which was made by U.S. defense contractor Harris (now L3Harris); or IMSI catchers, a technology that can capture a nearby cell phone’s unique identifier, which law enforcement can use for identifying the phone’s owner.

In the last two years, ICE has signed contracts for more than $1.5 million with a company called TechOps Specialty Vehicles (TOSV), which produces customized vans for law enforcement.

A contract worth more than $800,000, dated May 8, 2025, said TOSV will provide “Cell Site Simulator (CSS) Vehicles to support the Homeland Security Technical Operations program.”

TOSV president Jon Brianas told TechCrunch that the company does not manufacture the cell-site simulators, but rather integrates them “into our overall design of the vehicle.”

Cell-site simulators have long been controversial for several reasons.

These devices are designed to trick all nearby phones to connect to them, which means that, by design, they gather the data of many innocent people. Also, authorities have sometimes deployed them without first obtaining a warrant.

Authorities have also tried to keep their use of the technology secret in court, withholding information and even accepting plea deals and dropping cases rather than disclose information about their use of cell-site simulators. In a court case in 2019 in Baltimore, it was revealed that prosecutors were instructed to drop cases rather than violate a non-disclosure agreement with the company that makes the devices.

Clearview AI is perhaps the most well-known facial-recognition company today. For years, the company promised to be able to identify any face by searching through a large database of photos it had scraped from the internet.

On Monday, 404 Media reported that ICE has signed a contract with the company to support its law enforcement arm, Homeland Security Investigations (HSI), “with capabilities of identifying victims and offenders in child sexual exploitation cases and assaults against law enforcement officers.”

According to a government procurement database, the contract signed last week is worth $3.75 million.

ICE has had other contracts with Clearview AI in the last couple of years. In September 2024, the agency purchased “forensic software” from the company, a deal worth $1.1 million. The year before, ICE paid Clearview AI nearly $800,000 for “facial recognition enterprise licenses.”

Clearview AI did not respond to a request for comment.

ICE is also using a facial-recognition app called Mobile Fortify, which federal agents use to identify people on the street. The app relies on scanning a person’s driver’s license photo against 200 million photos, much of the data sourced from state driver’s license databases.

In September 2024, ICE signed a contract worth $2 million with Israeli spyware maker Paragon Solutions. Almost immediately, the Biden administration issued a “stop work order,” putting the contract under review to make sure it complied with an executive order on the government’s use of commercial spyware.

Because of that order, for nearly a year, the contract remained in limbo. Then, last week, the Trump administration lifted the stop-work order, effectively reactivating the contract.

At this point, the status of Paragon’s relationship with ICE in practice is unclear.

The records entry from last week said that the contract with Paragon is for “a fully configured proprietary solution including license, hardware, warranty, maintenance, and training.” Practically speaking, unless the hardware installation and training were done last year, it may take some time for ICE to have Paragon’s system up and running.

It’s also unclear if the spyware will be used by ICE or HSI, an agency whose investigations are not limited to immigration, but also cover online child sexual exploitation, human trafficking, financial fraud, and more.

Paragon has long tried to portray itself as an “ethical” and responsible spyware maker, and now has to decide if it’s ethical to work with Trump’s ICE. A lot has happened to Paragon in the last year. In December, American private equity giant AE Industrial purchased Paragon, with a plan to merge it with cybersecurity company RedLattice, according to Israeli tech news site Calcalist.

In a sign that the merger may have taken place, when TechCrunch reached out to Paragon for comment on the reactivation of the ICE contract last week, we were referred to RedLattice’s new vice president of marketing and communications, Jennifer Iras.

RedLattice’s Iras did not respond to a request for comment for this article, nor for last week’s article.

In the last few months, Paragon has been ensnared in a spyware scandal in Italy, where the government has been accused of spying on journalists and immigration activists. In response, Paragon cut ties with Italy’s intelligence agencies.

In mid-September, ICE’s law enforcement arm, Homeland Security Investigations, signed a contract with Magnet Forensics for $3 million.

This contract is specifically for software licenses so that HSI agents can “recover digital evidence, process multiple devices,” and “generate forensic reports,” according to the contract description.

Magnet is the current maker of the phone hacking and unlocking devices known as Graykey. These devices essentially give law enforcement agents the ability to connect a locked phone to them, unlock it, and access the data inside of it.

Magnet Forensics, which merged with Graykey maker Grayshift in 2023, did not respond to a request for comment.

At the end of September, 404 Media reported that ICE bought access to an “all-in-one” surveillance tool that allows the agency to search through databases of historical cellphone location data, as well as social media information.

The tool appears to be made of two products called Tangles and Webloc, which are made by a company called Penlink. One of the tools promises to leverage “a proprietary data platform to compile, process, and validate billions of daily location signals from hundreds of millions of mobile devices, providing both forensic and predictive analytics,” according to a redacted contract found by 404 Media.

The redacted contract does not identify which one of the tools makes that promise, but given its description, it’s likely Webloc. Forbes previously cited a case study that said Webloc can search a given location to “monitor trends of mobile devices that have given data at those locations and how often they have been there.”

This type of cellphone location data is harvested by companies around the world using software development kits (SDKs) embedded in regular smartphone apps, or with an online advertising process called real-time bidding (RTB), where companies bid in real-time to place an ad on the screen of a cellphone user based on their demographic or location data. The latter process has the by-product of giving ad tech companies that kind of personal data.

Once collected, this mass of location data is transferred to a data broker who then sells it to government agencies. Thanks to this layered process, authorities have used this type of data without getting a warrant by simply purchasing access to the data.

The other tool, Tangles, is an “AI-powered open-source intelligence” tool that automates “the search and analysis of data from the open, deep, and the dark web,” according to Penlink’s official site.

Forbes reported in September that ICE spent $5 million on Penlink’s two tools.

Penlink did not respond to a request for comment.

ICE relies on automated license plate reader (ALPR) companies to follow drivers across a large swath of the U.S., noting where people go and when.

ICE also leans on its connections with local law enforcement agencies, which have contracts with ALPR providers, like surveillance company Flock Safety, to obtain immigration data by the back door. Flock is one of the largest ALPR providers, with over 40,000 license plate scanners around the United States, and only getting larger with its partnerships with other companies, such as video surveillance company Ring.

Efforts by ICE to informally request data from local law enforcement have prompted some police departments to cut off federal agencies from their access.

Border Patrol runs its own surveillance network of ALPR cameras, the Associated Press reported.

For years, ICE has used the legal research and public records data broker LexisNexis to support its investigations.

In 2022, two non-profits obtained documents via Freedom of Information Act requests, which revealed that ICE performed more than 1.2 million searches over seven months using a tool called Accurint Virtual Crime Center. ICE used the tool to check the background information of migrants.

A year later, The Intercept revealed that ICE was using LexisNexis to detect suspicious activity and investigate migrants before they even committed a crime, a program that a critic said enabled “mass surveillance.”

According to public records, LexisNexis currently provides ICE “with a law enforcement investigative database subscription (LEIDS) which allows access to public records and commercial data to support criminal investigations.”

This year, ICE has paid $4.7 million to subscribe to the service.

LexisNexis spokesperson Jennifer Richman told TechCrunch that ICE has used the company’s product “data and analytics solutions for decades, across several administrations.”

“Our commitment is to support the responsible and ethical use of data, in full compliance with laws and regulations, and for the protection of all residents of the United States,” said Richman, who added that LexisNexis “partners with more than 7,500 federal, state, local, tribal, and territorial agencies across the United States to advance public safety and security.”

Data analytics and surveillance technology giant Palantir has signed several contracts with ICE in the last year. The biggest contract, worth $18.5 million from September 2024, is for a database system called “Investigative Case Management,” or ICM.

The contract for ICM goes back to 2022, when Palantir signed a $95.9 million deal with ICE. The Peter Thiel-founded company’s relationship with ICE dates back to the early 2010s.

Earlier this year, 404 Media, which has reported extensively on the technology powering Trump’s deportation efforts, and particularly Palantir’s relationship with ICE, revealed details of how the ICM database works. The tech news site reported that it saw a recent version of the database, which allows ICE to filter people based on their immigration status, physical characteristics, criminal affiliation, location data, and more.

According to 404 Media, “a source familiar with the database” said it is made up of ‘tables upon tables’ of data and that it can build reports that show, for example, people who are on a specific type of visa who came into the country at a specific port of entry, who came from a specific country, and who have a specific hair color (or any number of hundreds of data points).”

The tool, and Palantir’s relationship with ICE, was controversial enough that sources within the company leaked to 404 Media an internal wiki where Palantir justifies working with Trump’s ICE.

Palantir is also developing a tool called “ImmigrationOS,” according to a contract worth $30 million revealed by Business Insider.

ImmigrationOS is said to be designed to streamline the “selection and apprehension operations of illegal aliens,” give “near real-time visibility” into self-deportations, and track people overstaying their visa, according to a document first reported on by Wired.

First published on September 13, 2025, and updated on September 18, 2025, to include Magnet Forensics’ new contract, again on October 8, 2025, to include cell-site simulators and location data, and again on January 26, 2026, to include license plate readers.

            <p><strong>TechCrunch | 2026-01-26</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/26/social-network-upscrolled-sees-surge-in-downloads-following-tiktoks-us-takeover/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">In the wake of TikTok’s U.S. ownership change last week, some users are seeking out alternative platforms. One app gaining traction is UpScrolled, a social network that pledges to remain impartial to political agendas. The app currently ranks 12th overall in Apple’s App Store and second in the social networking category.

UpScrolled blends familiar features from Instagram and X, letting users share photos, videos, and text posts, discover new content, and send direct messages.

The app was founded last year by Issam Hijazi, a Palestinian-Jordanian-Australian technologist, with the aim of giving users a place to “freely express thoughts, share moments, and connect with others,” according to the app’s website. The team behind the app says they’re “building a platform that belongs to the people who use it — not to hidden algorithms or outside agendas.”

“UpScrolled is the foundation for a digital ecosystem that puts power back into the hands of the people — not the corporations,” Hijazi said in a statement on UpScrolled’s website. “It’s more than just an alternative to Meta, X, or TikTok — it’s a reimagining of what social media should be: a space where creators, communities, and businesses thrive independently, with real control, transparency, and accountability.”

The app, available on both iOS and Android, is grappling with a surge of new users but says it’s scaling to keep up with the demand.

According to data from the market intelligence provider Appfigures, UpScrolled saw approximately 41,000 downloads between Thursday, the day the TikTok deal was finalized, and Saturday, accounting for nearly one-third of its lifetime installs. UpScrolled has seen an average of about 14,000 daily downloads since Thursday, representing a 2,850% increase in daily downloads.

In total, the app has been downloaded 140,000 times to date, with 75,000 of those being U.S.-based installs.

“Well, this is new … You showed up so fast our servers tapped out,” the company wrote in a post on X. “Frustrating? Yes. Emotional? Also yes. We’re a tiny team building what Big Tech stopped being. Right now we’re scaling on caffeine to keep up with what YOU started. Bear with us. We’re on it.”

The surge comes as TikTok announced last Thursday that it signed a deal with a group of non-Chinese investors to form a majority American-owned joint venture to keep the social app operating in the U.S. TikTok’s Chinese parent ByteDance owns less than 20% of the new entity, while the venture’s three managing investors — Oracle, private equity firm Silver Lake, and Abu Dhabi-based investment company MGX — each hold a 15% stake. Some users worry that TikTok’s new U.S. investors may have political allegiances to Trump.

Following the takeover, some users accused the app of potentially censoring certain political content. This criticism included a handful of high-profile users, including Senator Chris Murphy and singer Billie Eilish, who raised concerns that TikTok was suppressing or limiting posts criticizing ICE. Additionally, some said they were unable to search for information about ongoing protests in Minneapolis following the killing of Alex Pretti by border patrol agents.

However, TikTok attributed these issues to an ongoing data center outage, which has been impacting its app’s functionality.

Concerns also grew when TikTok released an updated privacy policy that allows the app to track users’ GPS coordinates, among other things. This led to some users encouraging people to delete the app in favor of alternatives, with UpScrolled being one of the popular choices, largely due to its promise to not shadowban anyone and give “every post a fair chance to be seen.”

UpScrolled isn’t the only app that’s seeing a surge in users following the takeover. Skylight, a TikTok alternative built on open source technology, says it has now topped over 380,000 sign-ups and is continuing to grow.

            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/26/rad-power-bikes-reaches-deal-to-sell-itself-for-13-2-million/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Electric bike company Rad Power Bikes has reached a deal to sell itself to a company called Life Electric Vehicles Holdings (or Life EV) for around $13.2 million, a little more than a month after entering the bankruptcy process.

Florida-based Life EV bills itself as a “developer, manufacturer, and distributor in the light electric vehicle industry.” It offers a number of electric bikes for sale on its website, although most of them were labeled as “sold out” at the time this article was published.

A filing to the bankruptcy docket over the weekend shows that five entities participated in an auction on the Rad Power assets on January 22. The first bid came in at $8 million, and parties traded bids until Life Electric Vehicles came away as the winner. When accounting for Rad Power’s liabilities, the total value of the bid is $14.9 million.

Another e-bike company called Retrospec had the second-highest bid of $13 million and is being labeled as the “backup bidder” in case the deal with Life EV falls through. The bids were a steep discount to Rad Power’s peak $1.65 billion valuation, which was reached in October 2021, per PitchBook. The company has raised a total of $329.2 million, according to PitchBook data.

The acquisition still needs to be approved by the bankruptcy judge.

Rad Power is not the only company in the micromobility world to seek bankruptcy protection in recent years. Peers like VanMoof and Cake went through restructurings and found new owners. Scooter company Bird also went through the bankruptcy process.

It’s not clear what Life EV plans to do with Rad Power; Life EV CEO Robert Provost directed questions to Rad Power. “There is still a process underway and there is an exciting future being planned for Rad Power,” he wrote in a message.

TechCrunch was unable to reach Rad Power for comment; this article will be updated if the company responds.

Like many of those peers, Rad Power saw a huge increase in sales during the pandemic but struggled as that momentum dried up.

The company went through multiple rounds of layoffs in recent years, juggled CEOs, and more recently had trouble with some of its older batteries catching fire. The Consumer Product Safety Commission found 31 reported fires tied to the batteries.

Rad Power told TechCrunch at the time that it “firmly stands behind our batteries and our reputation as leaders in the e-bike industry, and strongly disagrees with the CPSC’s characterization of certain Rad batteries as defective or unsafe.”

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Industrial AI startup CVector built a brain and nervous system for big industry. Now, founders Richard Zhang and Tyler Ruggles are tasked with a bigger challenge: showing customers and investors how this AI-powered software layer translates to real savings on an industrial scale.

The New York-based startup has had some success following its pre-seed funding round last July. Its system is now running with real customers, including public utilities, advanced manufacturing facilities, and chemical producers. It’s given the duo more concrete examples of what problems they can solve — and money they can save — for their big industry clients.

“One of the core things we’re witnessing,” he said, is customers “really lack the tool to translate a small action, like turning on and off a valve, [into] did that just save me money?”

As a homeowner with bills to pay, it’s a bit unnerving to think about one nondescript valve making such a big difference in the bottom line of a company and its customers. But it’s examples like this that helped CVector reach a new milestone, as it has now closed a $5 million seed round, Zhang and Ruggles told TechCrunch.

The financing was led by Powerhouse Ventures and included a mix of venture and strategic backing, with participation from early-stage funds like Fusion Fund and Myriad Venture Partners, as well as Hitachi’s corporate venture arm.

With the funding round closed, CVector is talking a bit more about some of its first customers — and just how different they are.

“The joy of the last, say, six to eight months has been going to the industrial heartland, to all of these places that are just in the middle of nowhere, but have massive production plants that are either reinventing themselves or really transforming how they make decisions,” Zhang said in an interview.

One of those customers is a metals processing company based in Iowa called ATEK Metal Technologies, which makes aluminum castings for Harley-Davidson motorcycles, among other things. CVector is doing things like helping spot potential problems that could lead to equipment downtime, monitor the whole plant’s energy efficiency, and keep an eye on commodity prices that impact raw material cost.

“That is, to me, such a good example where this is really skilled labor, and they will need all the help they can get from for us, from the software side, from technology side, to really help that group of people transform, take the business to the next level so they can keep growing,” Zhang said.

Finding optimizations in older plants might seem like the most obvious path for a company like CVector. But it has also picked up startups as customers, too, including Ammobia, a materials science startup based in San Francisco that is working to lower the cost of making ammonia. And yet the work CVector is doing for Ammobia is surprisingly similar to what it’s doing for ATEK, Zhang said.

CVector is also growing. The company is up to 12 people, and it’s locked down its first physical office in the financial district in Manhattan. Zhang said he’s been attracting talent from the worlds of fintech and finance, especially hedge funds. The latter is ripe for recruiting, he said, since the people who work in the hedge fund industry are already pretty focused on using data to gain a financial edge.

“That’s the core of our sales pitch; it’s what we call ‘operational economics,’” Zhang said. “We position it to sit between the operation of the plant and the actual economics — the margin of how much you’re making money.”

Zhang still sees public utilities as a great place to apply CVector’s technology, though. (That’s where the valve example came from.) And he’s found that even these types of customers have become far more fluent in talking about the kinds of work CVector does.

“Tyler and I were just talking about how when we first started [the] company almost exactly a year ago, it was still like a taboo to talk about AI in general. There was a 50/50 chance if the customer would embrace AI or just kind of discredit you, right?” he said. “But now, over the especially last six months, everyone is asking for more AI-native solutions, even when sometimes the ROI calculation might not be clear. This kind of adoption craze is real.”

Ruggles said that’s in large part because what CVector does ultimately comes down to one thing: money. And with so much uncertainty in the world, managing costs has only gotten harder.

“We’re at this time when companies are really intimately worried about their supply chain and the costs and variability there, and being able to kind of layer AI on top [to make an] economic model of a facility, it’s really resonated with a lot of customers, whether it’s old and industrial in the heartland, or whether it’s new energy producers who are trying to do new and novel things,” he said.

            <h2>ICE Is Failing the Legitimacy Test</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-01-26</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/2026/01/policing-open-carry-minnesota-pretti/685767/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Carrying a concealed handgun in public is now commonplace in much of the country. For many, this is not only a prudent act of personal safety, but an expression of liberty and a bulwark against government overreach. At the same time, America&#39;s law-enforcement officers insist they must exercise vigilance while patrolling dangerous streets. When officers make a split-second decision to shoot someone who is carrying a gun, many political leaders, especially on the right, believe they need to be given deference because their lives were at risk.

The tension between these two ideas is acute, putting law enforcement and citizens on a potentially catastrophic collision course. One such collision took place in Minnesota on Saturday. It was fatal for the citizen. And it was potentially delegitimizing for law enforcement. A broader crisis of government legitimacy is imminent in the absence of a change in direction by the Trump administration.

Judging from the video evidence and news reports, this is what seems to have taken place: The Minneapolis nurse Alex Pretti carried his loaded, concealed 9-mm handgun to a protest against the ICE agents.  He had no criminal record, and a permit to carry the gun. Holding only a phone when an agent moved in to make an arrest, he was pepper-sprayed and thrown to the ground. Then, as federal agents wrestled him into submission, Pretti’s coat rode up and his holstered gun came into view. It set off panicked screams of “Gun!” among the agents. One of them reached in and removed the pistol from Pretti’s waistband; another then drew his own pistol and shot Pretti in the back. Pretti died in the street never having touched his gun. He had been disarmed before the first shot was even fired.

In response to this tragedy, the president of the United States wrote on social media: “LET OUR ICE PATRIOTS DO THEIR JOB!”

But surely doing their job well must include respecting the people they serve. For true Second Amendment advocates, Pretti’s decision to bring a gun to a protest in no way excuses his killing. A protester with a gun, they believe, is not courting his own demise. To these advocates, under the Second Amendment, there is no wrong time and place for a citizen to be armed; it is a right that “shall not be infringed.” Some states prohibit guns at protests, but Minnesota is not one of them. As of 2025, more than 20 million Americans held a concealed carry permit. And 29 states have adopted Constitutional Carry, meaning a permit is not required.

Robert F. Worth: Welcome to the American winter

None of this is to say that policing an armed society is easy. It requires highly trained, well-led officers who can navigate incidents including routine calls and crimes in progress with discipline and restraint. It also requires a commitment to transparency—and to accountability, when police wrongly shoot a person exercising their right to carry a gun. In this regard, ICE and the federal government have failed dismally.

ICE agents are poorly screened and quickly hired. They spend just 47 days in their training academy, a shorter duration than nearly all law enforcement organizations; Minnesota, for example, requires about double the training for its police officers at 1,050 hours. In the field, they are saddled with quotas for how many people they must apprehend. That leads to desperate measures and poor decisions. Many of these agents wear masks to conceal their identity and project an air of menace. They regularly flout their own body-camera policy, which their agency is seeking to roll back. They have been instructed to use force to enter homes without the judicial warrant the Constitution requires. They perform poorly at crowd control, resorting to tear gas and pepper spray with an alarming frequency.

Compounding these problems, the federal government has vilified the men and women shot by ICE agents, including U.S. citizens; refused to conduct transparent investigations; and contemptuously blocked state agencies from doing so. Federal officials have declared ICE’s killings lawful and justified over social media without any pretense of a formal review, making statements that are cruel, derogatory, misleading, or simply false. People who want the government to account for what it has done are told to go pound sand.

A particularly vivid example of this dynamic occurred three weeks ago, when an ICE agent, also in Minneapolis, killed Renee Good as she tried to drive away from him. The agency argued that a car on the move is a lethal threat, so an officer who steps in front of a car can shoot a driver who doesn’t stop. The New York City Police Department prohibited shooting at moving vehicles in 1972, and most major cities tightly regulate the practice. Professional police agencies have learned that shooting the driver doesn’t stop the car or make the officer any safer; the best bet is to get out of the way. Rather than explain this contradiction, ICE dismissed criticism, immediately declared Good’s killing necessary and lawful, labeled her a domestic terrorist and the officer a hero, and shut down efforts to investigate the incident. Then the Department of Justice ordered federal prosecutors and the FBI to investigate Good’s family for ties to left-wing radicals, leading several prosecutors to resign. This is not the behavior of government officials who can plausibly argue that they have a legitimate right to use force against citizens.

Contrary to the administration’s feverish claims, the protesters in Minneapolis are not “woke” leftist domestic terrorists confronting responsible law-enforcement officers to foment an insurrection. As best we can tell, among the cast of activists are citizens of every class, ideology, and race, standing up for basic decency and constitutional liberties. One of our mothers-in-law regularly demonstrates against ICE, and she hasn’t protested anything since the Vietnam War. In the face of the dangers posed by armed, masked men who have been reassured by the president that they will receive immunity for their actions—both legally incorrect and a bad idea—these citizens are putting themselves on the line to say that what is happening is inconsistent with America’s most fundamental values.

There is a lot of overlap between the elected officials who exhort Americans to carry guns wherever they like, and the ones who tend to stand by law-enforcement officers who use lethal force. These positions are not always contradictory, but in this situation they are flatly incompatible. If elected officials are going to stump for the Second Amendment, and at the same time refuse to hold a federal agency accountable for killing an American exercising that very right, the country is at risk of losing any right to protest. And the federal government is calling into question its legitimacy.</div>

            <h2>The Worst Thing About the Black Dahlia Case</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-01-26</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/books/2026/01/woman-who-became-black-dahlia/685739/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Elizabeth Short liked to wander. Sometimes this wandering was merely in her mind, watching movies and dreaming of a life far beyond her hometown of Medford, Massachusetts. Many times, it was physical; she’d land in a new city—Miami, Jacksonville, Chicago, Long Beach, San Diego, Los Angeles—and explore its streets on foot. Sometimes her travels revolved around family, as when she tracked down her long-lost father and lived with him for a time—until he cast her out. On January 9, 1947, Short, who was 22, told a gentleman friend to drop her off at the Biltmore Hotel in downtown Los Angeles, where her sister was supposedly waiting. She was never seen alive again.

A contemporary version of Elizabeth—dreamy, elusive, independent, and canny—might be called a flaneuse, someone curious about the world. But we’ll never know what kind of life she would have led; by the time her bisected body was found in a vacant lot, six days after she left the Biltmore, Elizabeth had ceased to be a person. From then on, she became “The Black Dahlia,” an archetype, a myth, a riddle that countless people have attempted to solve in books, films, television shows, podcasts, websites, internet-message boards, and social-media posts.

“After we are dead, the pretense that we may be protected against the world’s careless malice is abandoned,” Janet Malcolm wrote in her book The Silent Woman. She was referring to the poet and novelist Sylvia Plath, another beautiful young woman who died too soon, after which her life and words became grist for the biographical mill. But Malcolm’s words apply equally, even eerily, to the afterlife of Short—one of America’s most famous murder victims, and certainly among the most persistent subjects of the true-crime industrial complex.

From the moment Short’s killing became headline news, sensation was the prime directive. With every new lead, confession, and suspect, the actual Elizabeth receded further. It didn’t help that she was an enigmatic character in life, prone to embellishment and even lies. She recounted tales of woe to paramours only to ask them for money, exaggerated her prospects in missives to her mother, told friends about a dead husband and a child who probably didn’t exist—all without letting on about her actual precarious straits. Short avoided the spotlight, but over the nearly 80 years since her death, it has wholly consumed her.

This kind of flattening happens all too often with murder victims, particularly young women and girls who die at the hands of a serial killer, usually male. (Never mind that more marginalized women, especially women of color, are less likely to merit any attention at all.) In Short’s case, the flattening is particularly egregious, because the inchoate facts of her life are shoehorned into the obsessions of amateur sleuths who continue to get those facts wrong.

Read: A provocative argument about what creates serial killers

William J. Mann’s new book, Black Dahlia: Murder, Monsters, and Madness in Midcentury Hollywood, attempts a different approach: to weave the fragments we have into a narrative whole that prioritizes Short, in all of her contradictions, and tries to debunk decades’ worth of accumulated myths. Although Mann’s effort stands apart from the overlong run of books about the case, it, too, is undercut by the need to name a likely suspect, playing into the true-crime imperative it aims to leave behind.

Mann begins Black Dahlia in late July 1946, several months before Short’s murder and not long after her arrival in Long Beach, California. Over the ensuing period, Short befriends women and dates men; wears sophisticated clothing, ankle-strapped high heels, and flowers in her hair; and comes across as “a very modest girl who never cursed or acted sexy,” in the words of one friend. The reader comes to understand why fascination has proved more appealing than facts: We know very little about her life. Short defied norms and customs. She seemed innocent in the ways of men but savvy enough to keep her dates at a respectful distance. The two women who knew her best during this time, Marjorie Graham and Anne Toth, whom Mann renders more fully than any author before him, still had trouble understanding what made Short tick.

Mann starts the story, however, from the vantage point of Tod Faulkner, who says he first spotted Short in a two-piece bathing suit, walking alone toward the beach, and saw her again several more times that summer. Faulkner was 11 at the time, and says he never forgot her. Yet after growing up to become a journalist, he was the one who immortalized the erroneous middle name “Ann,” in a 1971 article for the Los Angeles Times. Faulkner’s error would propagate in numerous articles, books, and films before being codified in the 1975 TV movie Who Is the Black Dahlia?, which starred Lucie Arnaz (the daughter of Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz) as Short. Already we have the conflict between truth and myth, and we’re only on page four.

From there, Mann situates the known facts about the last few months of Short’s life in postwar Los Angeles, whose rising murder rate led to an even sharper spike in fear. From 1945 to 1946, “while the homicide rate for men grew by 26.8 percent, the number of women murdered in that same period shot up by 52.9 percent,” Mann points out. Over the next few years, the increase in violent deaths of women, seemingly at the hands of strangers, was reflected in the growing genre of film noir and in novels including Dorothy B. Hughes’s In a Lonely Place, which was published less than a year after Short’s murder.

Fear also sold newspapers, as any tabloid journalist at the time could tell you. And tell people they did, particularly in the early days and weeks after Short’s death, when the tiniest new detail about the “Black Dahlia” investigation—even, or especially, if that detail wasn’t true—could boost circulation. Mann calls out many instances of “sexing up the news” (a phrase he uses multiple times): the description of the block where Short’s body was discovered as a “lover’s lane”; invented testimony from witnesses and family members (including Short’s grieving mother, Phoebe); exaggerations in the memoirs of the L.A. newspaper editors Agness Underwood and Jimmy Richardson, early chroniclers—and shapers—of the murder narrative.

The errors and suppositions would multiply over the decades—most of them cataloged by the former L.A. Times reporter and historian Larry Harnisch. Was Short a sex worker? Blame John Gregory Dunne’s otherwise terrific 1977 novel, True Confessions, which gave its Short stand-in the moniker “The Virgin Tramp” along with a past career in pornography. (Without True Confessions, James Ellroy probably wouldn’t have written his own The Black Dahlia novel in 1987, which led to a 2006 film adaptation.) Did she have sexual dysfunction? That’s an invention of a former Examiner reporter, Will Fowler, bolstered by John Gilmore in his supposedly nonfiction 1994 account, Severed, which includes information from a detective, “Herman Willis,” who doesn’t seem to have existed.

False suspects also proliferated. Was George Hodel the killer? So his son Steve Hodel keeps insisting, first in his 2003 book, Black Dahlia Avenger, then in a later book that also puts George forward as the Zodiac Killer (oy). Janice Knowlton, too, believed that her father murdered Elizabeth: Read about it in Daddy Was the Black Dahlia Killer. Piu Eatwell’s Black Dahlia, Red Rose initially convinced me that Leslie Dillon was the culprit, but Mann’s account definitively rules Dillon out. Eli Frankel’s Sisters in Death, published just last year, strains (and, to my mind, fails) to connect Short to an unsolved murder in Kansas City. And a new podcast hosted by Michael Connelly, Killer in the Code, also tries to connect the Black Dahlia and the Zodiac Killer, with the help of a “cold-case consultant” who bases his “smoking gun” on a deathbed sketch that better resembles fan art.

Shiftiness, con artistry, and even violence toward women don’t add up to hard, incriminating evidence. Mann, too, succumbs to the temptation, perhaps reluctantly; he spends precious pages explaining why one of Elizabeth’s Long Beach boyfriends, a military veteran named Marvin Margolis who died in 1993—the same suspect in Connelly’s podcast—can’t be ruled out as the killer. (The original detectives crossed him off the list early in the investigation.) Even Mann seems dissatisfied when he mulls the prospect that a stranger killed Short: “She was simply a vulnerable young woman who came face-to-face with someone with severe and violent psychopathology who decided, either on impulse or deliberation, to kill her, to use her body to express rage and resentment at the world.”

After so much time has passed, no one is likely to be satisfied with any identification of Short’s killer. If the lead detective, Harry Hansen, is to be believed, the Los Angeles Police Department never once interviewed the actual killer despite interrogating scores of suspects—including all of those mentioned in prior books, and now Mann’s. Any outcome would likely resemble the identification last September, via investigative genetic genealogy, of the man responsible for the 1991 quadruple homicide in Austin, Texas, known as the “Yogurt Shop Murders.” In that case, pinning down the murderer didn’t erase the 34 years of anguish and damage sustained by the girls’ families and the young men wrongfully convicted—including one who had been on death row. After decades of pain and exploitation, solving the case feels like an anticlimax.

“Solving” the Black Dahlia case, most likely through genetic genealogy, may bring an answer, but it would only generate many more questions. Harnisch, the historian, who knows more about the case than almost anybody (and has a credible theory relegated to a footnote in Mann’s book), put it best in a 2020 interview: “This is a story that fades to conjecture. This is a story without an ending.”

Look past the need for narrative and there, out on the horizon, is Elizabeth Short, walking down a California boulevard, trying to create a better story for herself. She didn’t have to remain forever a girl wounded by her father’s rejection, too proud to admit the truth about her life to her mother and sisters, yet resourceful enough to survive, for a time, in a world that couldn’t care less. Her luck ran out, and we don’t know why, or who killed her. But the brutality of Short’s death shouldn’t supersede her life any more than myth should overshadow a larger truth: that her murder will never truly make any sense.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Anyone who thinks the contemplative life amounts to a form of quietism or a retreat from the world’s suffering should spend some time shadowing Joan Halifax, the Zen priest and anthropologist. I’d been curious about Halifax for years, ever since I heard about an annual trek that she leads through the mountains of Nepal, bringing a cadre of doctors and dentists to remote mountain villages with little access to health care.

Each summer over the course of two weeks or so, this Nomads Clinic covers more than 100 miles on foot and horseback, at altitudes of nearly 18,000 feet. These “medical mountaineers,” as they’ve been called,  all volunteers, sleep in tents, often in freezing temperatures. But after some 40 annual trips to Nepal—Halifax is normally based in Santa Fe—she recently decided it was time to hang it up. She had just turned 80.

In addition to bringing medical care to remote mountain villages half a world away, Halifax has ministered to the dying in hospice, worked with the homeless in New Mexico, cared for prisoners on death row, and led countless protests for peace. I don’t know if Halifax has shed the last remnants of her ego—she would say she hasn’t—but the selflessness she manifests in the conduct of her life is something to behold, a reminder of what the exploration of human consciousness can lead a person to do and be. This, too, is a Buddhist principle—that overcoming one’s own small self should lead to greater compassion for others, and that the suffering alleviated when we transcend the ego is not only our own.

For more than 30 years, Halifax has been the abbot at Upaya Zen Center, the retreat she founded in Santa Fe in 1990. I’ve had the chance to meet her a couple of times; once, we appeared together on a panel to talk about psychedelics. Halifax was married to the pioneering Czech psychiatrist Stanislav Grof for several years in the 1970s. Working together, they gave transformative doses of LSD to the dying. For a period of time, Halifax regularly took large doses of LSD herself. Her first psychedelic trip, while wandering the streets of Paris in 1968, showed her “that there was beauty behind the beauty I perceived, and that mind was both in here and out there. I was dumbstruck.”

I could relate. After years of curiosity about psychoactive plants, my own experimentation with mushrooms and LSD in recent years fundamentally changed the way I understand the mysteries of consciousness and the self. So in 2024, I emailed Halifax to see if I might pay a visit to Upaya. My idea was to spend a week or so in residence, meditating with the aspiring monks, performing monkish chores, interviewing Halifax, and seeing if I could make a little more progress untying the knot of self. “Upaya is a factory for the deconstruction of selves,” she had told me. I was curious to find out how that worked.

Read: Psychedelics open your brain. You might not like what falls in.

But Roshi Joan, as everyone calls her, had other plans for me. She decided I should spend a day or two at Upaya and then accompany her up to “the refuge,” an off-the-grid compound of tiny houses and huts stretched out across a broad hammock of meadow at 9,400 feet in the Sangre de Cristo Mountains, north of Santa Fe. Whenever she’s not traveling or running conferences or teaching, Halifax retreats to these mountains, where she meditates and hikes and paints and writes and doesn’t have to play the role of abbot. She dispatches students to the refuge when she deems them in need of a period of monastic solitude—for years at a time, in some cases.

“After you’ve acclimated to the altitude, we’ll drive up to the refuge,” she said by email before my arrival in Santa Fe. “You can stay in the cave.” This was not put in the form of a question.

Halifax explained that even though it had neither plumbing nor electricity nor an internet connection, this was “a five-star cave” and I would be comfortable—or, more likely, I’d be uncomfortable in a spiritually productive way. I’m not much of a camper but decided I might as well put myself in her hands to see what the experience would yield.

The first thing you notice about Joan Halifax is her undiminished beauty—the shining blue eyes and the easy smile and the generous sweep of white hair. That she’s 83 is hard to believe. She moves through Upaya’s little village of low-slung adobes and tended gardens with a graceful authority. Yet abbot is a role that, these days, she’s more than happy to trade for the solitude and freedom of the refuge.

The refuge is at the end of a 25-mile-long rutted dirt road that climbs through a shadowy forest of pine and spruce, punctuated by the sparkle of the occasional stream or meadow. Though it was well into June, spring was still unfolding at this altitude, the meadow grasses and spruce tips bright green and the groves of ivory-trunked aspen just leafing out. After we unloaded our SUV at the main house, where we would gather for meals (and connect to the outside world, as the house has a satellite internet connection), Halifax escorted me to my lodgings, a hike of half a mile along a path through meadows lined with aspen trees, their new leaves fluttering gently. Along the way, she identified the scat of elk, deer, and bears.

The cave was a 12-by-15-foot cell dug into a south-facing hillside and lined with brown stucco; it was windowless except for a sliding glass door overlooking the meadow. In one corner stood a spartan single bed, in the other a small woodstove. Between them, against the back wall, a meditation cushion sat on a raised platform, beneath an embroidered fabric depicting a Buddhist figure I didn’t recognize. I pictured myself seated cross-legged on the platform, like one of those levitating yogis in a New Yorker cartoon. The room also had a small sink fed by a five-gallon jug of water suspended above it, a two-burner camp stove, some shelving for clothes and books, and a car battery hooked up to a small solar panel outside. This produced just enough juice to power a reading light and charge a phone, though with no cell service or internet connection, what was the point?

What was the point? Why did Roshi Joan want me here rather than at Upaya or the main house, with its creature comforts? (And why did she keep putting off our interview?) I came to suspect she had decided that the questions I had for her—questions regarding Buddhist ideas about the self and consciousness and her own path from psychedelics to Zen—were best approached obliquely, perhaps by way of firsthand experience rather than words; that I should answer them myself. When I’d told her what I was working on, she had diagnosed me as hopelessly stuck in my head. Better to spend several days alone with myself meditating and navigating these hills than in the more familiar landscape of concepts, something to which I should have known a Zen priest would be allergic. When we finally did sit down for our interview, in the main house on the morning of the third day, Roshi Joan began by saying, somewhat cryptically, that she had “divested from meaning.” Okay.

It took me a while to realize that for Halifax, the practice of Buddhism was everything and theories were of little use or consequence. It was only through doing that she had learned her most enduring life lessons, whether that meant sitting with death-row inmates who taught her how powerlessness ferments into anger, or ministering to people in their last days and hours. “You learn to be nimble toward whatever is arising, because there’s no one death,” she said, “and if you cling to expectations, you will experience futility.” It was here, in doing the work, that Buddhist ideas about impermanence, conditioning, and dependent arising became flesh.

I took the hint. When I asked Halifax about herself or about Buddhist philosophy, she often ducked my questions or directed me elsewhere, so during one of our daily walks, I instead asked her to describe exactly how her factory for the deconstruction of selves operated.

People come on silent retreat for a week or two at a time and spend most of their days sitting in the Zendo—the meditation hall—facing a wall or tracing walking meditations on the gravel paths that meander through Upaya’s gardens. (I’d witnessed this glacial parade of earnest zombies.) I asked if novices received any guidance or technique. Not much, she said. Students are instructed about posture, and beginners are told to follow the breath, which “unifies body, mind, and space.” As Halifax has written, zazen, or sitting, “is not a mental exercise, a thing you do with your mind.” Rather, “it is about being radically open to things just as they are, not grasping at or rejecting phenomena, but simply being present and at ease with moment-to-moment uncertainty and groundlessness” and “letting openness or not-knowing deconstruct our version of reality. It is the method of non-method.” Just sitting, upright—that, apparently, is all there is to zazen.

“Zen is the hardest school,” Halifax explained, “because there is so little support.” But at Upaya, she told me, “there is the jungle gym of structure”—the strict rules and rituals and routines that govern life on retreat.

“There’s a certain point at about day three where you can feel the whole room go poof,” she said. “And everyone realizes we’re now in one body, one mind.” I asked her how this transformation was achieved. “We don’t say we’re deconstructing the self, but that is what we’re doing,” she told me. “Living in silence means you can’t start a conversation, so there’s no opportunity for self-presentation. Then there are the rituals that organize the day. These draw people into the group and relieve them of having to make decisions. Rituals take the place of a certain amount of volition.” It hadn’t occurred to me that ritual and silence could serve as tools to change consciousness and breach the hard shell of self.

But it is the agony of meditating for hours at a time that finally breaks down the ego. I asked her what people meditate about. “Mostly they ruminate and plan,” she said. “They do that until they can’t stand the thought of themselves any longer. You’re just sitting there for hours on end, and the entertainment value of watching the same reruns all day long diminishes over time. Pretty soon, it becomes unsustainable; they’re exhausted and uncomfortable, and that’s when they drop in.”

To “drop in,” Halifax explained, is to enter a state of being completely present in time and space, experiencing “the sense field”—the world as it appears to our senses prior to thought—without conceptualizing, and surrendering the sense of a separate self. The recipe was simpler (and much less appetizing) than I would have imagined: To transcend the self, force yourself to be alone with it long enough to get so bored and exhausted that you are happy to let it go.

Halifax, who did anthropological fieldwork in Africa, thinks of the Zen retreat as an initiation ceremony, or rite of passage, and like most such rites, it involves the metaphorical death of the ego followed by rejoining the group. She regards the psychedelic trip as another rite of initiation, but “it’s a shortcut,” and one she’d rather her students not take. I wondered if this helped explain why she preferred that I stay at the refuge rather than mingle with her students at Upaya. Perhaps she thought contact with me would undermine the process by encouraging them to take the psychedelic shortcut.

“There is a lot gained when we give up the self,” she noted. “We break out of rumination. We discover we’re part of something larger, and we learn it feels good to care for others.” When I asked Halifax if she had succeeded in exorcising her own self, she allowed that she can be self-righteous at times. “There is moral injury, moral outrage, moral apathy—all of them are products of either a sense of superiority or inferiority,” she said. “So they’re all ego-based.”

I came to understand that Roshi Joan had sent me to the cave because there were no words or ideas she could offer that would teach me as much as simply being completely alone with myself in the middle of these mountains, with no phone or any other screens (and no toilet). Her idea, I eventually saw, was to pose a kind of experiential koan for me to puzzle and, perhaps, to help me unlearn some of the things I thought I had learned about consciousness and the self.

Cave life quickly stripped down to the bare essentials: collecting, splitting, and stacking wood; building fires; hauling water; digging pits in the woods; sweeping the floor and threshold; and, for hours each day, meditating on the platform. I’ve meditated for several years now, but never as easily or as deeply or as strangely as I did in my little cave. It may have been the silence, which felt bottomless, or the certainty that I would not be interrupted or distracted. Even the air there felt different, as if the absence of the electromagnetic waves that normally surround and pass through us made it easier to empty the mind of its usual detritus. I found I could sit for hours at a time, something I’d never managed to do before.

It helped that there was nothing else I needed to do, except maybe brew a cup of tea or sweep the cave again. Somehow, these seemed like particularly cave-appropriate activities. I fell into a routine so elemental and repetitive that it began to feel like ritual. The only snafu came the first time I attempted to use my hand-dug pit toilet and, failing to position myself properly, managed to pee into my sneaker. Now I was a shoeless monk. Which also seemed cave-appropriate.

One morning, I decided to try a meditation I’d learned from my time with the Nepalese French Buddhist monk Matthieu Ricard, who has written extensively on the self as an illusion. To see this, he suggested I explore the rooms of my mind, one by one, as if searching for a thief—what he called “the thief of self.” Looking within, I found all sorts of mental stuff but, as Ricard had predicted, none of it qualified as a self. Rather, I witnessed a parade of unbidden, free-floating perceptions, feelings, images, sensations, and thoughts, but I could locate no thinker of these thoughts or perceiver of these perceptions.

The longer I sat, the stranger these appearances became, as the space of my awareness became an empty stage. Picture a circus ring where all kinds of images might suddenly and inexplicably appear out of nowhere. Why is there now a bank of three old-timey telephone booths with men inside making calls? And what’s this hammer suddenly coming down on a knee?! Or that automatic glass door swinging open for no one? These stray images were then blasted away by a blazing sun that completely filled the space of awareness before transforming itself into a gigantic eyeball—a sighted sun with a black circle of iris. Could this be the anarchic mind that emerges when the ego relinquishes its hold?

Maybe, and yet these dreamy, hypnagogic images were more curious than frightening, probably because it was easy enough to chase them away, to change the mental channel, simply by willing it. So then who, or what, did the chasing? The source of that will, that inchoate “I,” might have escaped introspective detection, yet it could still make things happen or stop happening. The self might well be illusory, I decided, but no more so than color or any other construct of the mind. Put another way, the self can be both illusory and real, or real enough.

Initially, I found I was talking to myself out loud, trying to fill the vast space of silence, which made it feel as though I had doubled my self rather than eliminated it—given it a little company. “Should I brew a cup of tea? Put another log on the fire?” I would ask. And I would answer: “Sure,” or “Good idea.” But after a day or two, I fell in love with the silence, and the voices stopped. I found the handful of chores completely absorbing, as if nothing in the world mattered as much as splitting firewood, fully occupying my attention and leaving no remainder of thought, self-consciousness, or anticipation. The distance between living and meditating had narrowed to a sliver. When I described the satisfactions of my routine to Roshi Joan during one of our hikes, she smiled: “That’s the sacredness of the everyday.”

Something was happening to my sense of self, and it seemed to have everything to do with what was happening to my sense of time. I had never given much thought to the relationship between self and time, but it explains a lot. When the self is deprived of time past (memory) and future (anticipation), it melts away. Absorbed in meditation, or in my chores, or in watching a small herd of elk graze in the meadow below at sunset, I could feel my time horizon shrink. The feeling was unfamiliar, since my usual mental coordinates place me somewhere in the proximate future, a locus of anticipation and, all too often, unfocused worry. But now, for longer and longer stretches, I was simply here, being, with no thought of the past or the future.

To my surprise, these moments of simple and more or less self-less consciousness did not occur when my eyes were closed—in fact, the darkness sent me zooming off to all kinds of strange places. No, now it was when my eyes were open that the stream of thought stilled and pooled, and not only on the meditation platform; it could happen when I was moving around the cave doing chores or hiking in the woods. The miraculous everyday fact of consciousness loomed larger than “the hard problem” of how a brain produces subjective experience.

Had I “dropped in”? There were moments when all I experienced was what Roshi Joan had called the “sense field.” This happened especially upon opening my eyes in meditation, but it was never very long before I slipped back into reflection and then the inevitable jotting-down of notes, and all at once I was back in the self-world. To stay in that state of unthinking presence was like walking a tightrope only to suddenly look down, panic, and come plunging back to Earth.

Except once, when I managed to look not down but up. I had woken up in the middle of the night and stepped outside into the cold night air. There was a new moon, and the only light in the world was that of the stars, which were out in force, brighter and more numerous than I’d ever seen them, but also strangely different. Instead of dotting the same black scrim, like pinholes in a two-dimensional theater backdrop, the stars were scattered through space at dramatically varying distances, a vast swarm of them filling every last corner of an even vaster, more numinous, and emphatically three-dimensional darkness. Even stranger, the negative space between the stars had flipped to positive, forming a soft, almost palpable blackness that embraced the stars and reached all the way to Earth, enveloping it and me in the same intergalactic blanket. For the first time, I could see—no, could feel—that the stars and I shared the same infinite space.

My brain’s usual priors, predictions, and inferences about the night sky had broken down, it seemed, allowing me to see more of the galaxy and space itself than I ever had. There was hugely more of it and less of me, rendered infinitesimal in the presence of this immensity. I felt as though every previous experience I’d had of the night sky had been filtered through some idea or model or expectation and so had been something less than completely conscious. And I understood that this state—abstracted, distracted—had been my default. A line in a poem by Jorie Graham came to me:

This is what is wrong: we, only we, the humans, can retreat from ourselves and

Only we, the humans. Yes! What other animal can afford to be anything less than completely conscious?

This moment of being fully, freshly present to the universe stopped me cold and made me wonder if all my hard thinking about consciousness had missed something crucial about it. The more I focused the narrow beam of my attention on what consciousness is and what it does and how it came to be, the less of it I was actually experiencing—whatever it was. My time in the cave and, now, beneath this night sky showed me the price of my impatience with the mystery.

“Always keep a don’t-know mind,” Roshi Joan had said to me. Sometimes not knowing opens us to possibilities that knowing, or trying to know, or thinking we already know, closes off. In the years since I had embarked on this inquiry, desperate to know, I had narrowed the aperture of my awareness, sacrificing this, the glory of the night sky, for a keen intellectual focus. But as my days of solitude in these mountains had shown me, that wider circle of light, that numinous lantern of awareness, is still available to us, so long as we can break the spell of self and its distractions. Consciousness is a miracle, truly, and remains the deepest of mysteries, yes, but it is also so very simple that it can fit into a sentence: I open my eyes and a world appears.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Pity Chris Summerlin, the dean of students at the University of Florida. He’s being sued by an anti-Semite, and that’s not the worst of his predicament. So far, judges who have ruled on the case have given mixed verdicts on whether he is likely to win or lose at trial. Summerlin deserves to lose on the merits: He expelled a law-school student for speech that, while morally degenerate, is properly protected by the First Amendment. And––this is the pitiable part––it’s easy to see how he might have concluded that giving a bigot grounds to win a civil-rights lawsuit was his best option.

College deans and administrators keep confronting the same dilemma: They face intense pressure to punish speech that elicits fear or moral disgust on campus. They also have legal obligations—and face countervailing pressure—to refrain from violating the free-speech rights of students. They cannot always do both. The result is cases such as Damsky v. Summerlin—cases that might be avoided under a better approach to fighting anti-Semitism and other hateful ideas.

Preston Damsky was a law student at the University of Florida who was open about his belief that America was founded by and for the white race and that its racial character should be preserved, by force if necessary. According to court documents, he wrote in one assignment that “the founding generations” fought, killed, and died for their sovereignty, and argued, “We are not yet so outnumbered and so neutered that we cannot seize back what is rightfully ours.” To survive “as masters in the ancestral lands of their ancestors,” he wrote in another paper, “the People” must exercise “their revolutionary right to dismember or overthrow” the government, “a process which no deskbound jurist can gleefully look forward to; for it will be a controversy decided not by the careful balance of Justitia’s scales, but by the gruesome slashing of her sword.”

Neither passage was initially deemed to violate school rules, however much they upset Damsky’s peers. But they informed the way that administrators reacted when Damsky went on X on March 21 and posted the following:

My position on Jews is simple: whatever Harvard professor Noel Ignatiev meant by his call to “abolish the White race by any means necessary” is what I think must be done with Jews. Jews must be abolished by any means necessary.

Ignatiev, who died in 2019, was a factory worker who entered academia late in life as a Marxist and gained minor notoriety with his 1995 book, How the Irish Became White. A few years prior, he co-founded a journal called Race Traitor. He believed that whiteness and white privilege were social constructs that impeded working-class solidarity and that people ought to renounce their privilege and become “unwhite,” thus abolishing whiteness. “Without the privileges attached to it, the white race would not exist, and white skin would have no more social significance than big feet,” he once said.

After Damsky invoked Ignatiev in his X post, a Jewish law professor replied, “Are you saying you would murder me and my family? Is that your position?” To which Damsky retorted, “Did Ignatiev want Whites murdered? If so, were his words as objectionable as mine? If Ignatiev sought genocide, then surely a genocide of all Whites would be an even greater outrage than a genocide of all Jews, given the far greater number of Whites.”

The exchange troubled many observers inside and outside the university, though they differed on what to make of it. Should Damsky’s statement that “Jews must be abolished by any means necessary” be received as a portent of murderous violence? Was it the hateful rhetoric of a contemptible but presumably nonmurderous anti-Semite? Or, given the reference to a leftist academic who wanted to abolish whiteness, was it the snide trolling of a shitposter mocking a double standard? No one knew for sure. Even the closest readers of the post could trouble themselves wondering if Damsky’s words implied something more than a call for members of that group to voluntarily abjure their own identity.

Soon, Damsky was suspended, then expelled. In suspending Damsky, the school asserted that he’d “created a material and substantial disruption to the academic operation of the UF College of Law.” When it expelled him, it cited provisions in its student code that prohibit “disruptive conduct” and “harassment”––but both provisions state that whatever they prohibit does not include “conduct protected by the First Amendment.”

In subsequent legal proceedings, the University of Florida would defend the expulsion of the student, arguing that Damsky’s words constituted “true threats,” which are not protected by the First Amendment, and were disruptive. Though public schools can prohibit some speech that is “substantially disruptive to learning,” even if, outside of schooling, the same speech would be protected, there is disagreement about whether and how that precedent applies to higher education. “UF cannot hold its adult students to a standard created for students as young as five years old,” the ACLU stated in an amicus brief supporting Damsky as he sought a preliminary injunction to reverse his expulsion. “That is especially true when the adult is engaging in speech off-campus.”

To win at that preliminary stage, Damsky had to show a substantial likelihood that he would prevail in the case overall. He cleared that high hurdle, according to Judge Allen Winsor. “Some may assume that anyone uttering such commentary is more likely to act violently than someone who does not,” he wrote in his U.S. District Court opinion, but “the test is whether Damsky’s posts constituted a ‘serious expression’ that he meant ‘to commit an act of unlawful violence.’” Acknowledging that “many would not love the idea of attending school with someone who burns crosses, marches in Nazi parades, or engages in countless other forms of offensive expression,” Winsor noted—quoting Justice William Brennan’s landmark First Amendment ruling in Texas v. Johnson—it is still the case that “the government may not prohibit the expression of an idea simply because society finds the idea itself offensive or disagreeable.” Nor, the judge ruled, did the university meet the burden for showing the speech to be disruptive in a way that rendered it unprotected.

But the judge’s order to reinstate Damsky was paused pending appeal. And the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that in its estimation, the University of Florida was likely to prevail, because under the precedent set in Tinker v. Des Moines Independent Community School District, “the First Amendment does not protect speech that ‘materially disrupts classwork or involves substantial disorder or invasion of the rights of others.’” The trial court, and perhaps future appeals-court judges and the Supreme Court, will decide if they agree with the panel’s ruling that “UF students, faculty, and staff could reasonably interpret Damsky’s posts as threatening violence on UF’s campus,” and that the community “could reasonably interpret Damsky’s posts as promoting extralegal violence, and schools can regulate at least some speech that calls for illegal conduct.” (I hope other judges disagree: Such a precedent would suggest that college students can be expelled for political speech as common as “abolish whiteness,” “globalize the intifada,” and “no justice, no peace.”)

When a college decisively loses at any stage of free-speech litigation, civil libertarians typically point to the loss as a powerful case for honoring the First Amendment if only out of self-interest: Don’t expel a student like that dean did, or your school will get sued and lose too. But colleges are caught between conflicting incentives right now. Few in higher education have forgotten the 2023 congressional hearings in which Representative Elise Stefanik questioned the presidents of Harvard, MIT, and the University of Pennsylvania about anti-Semitism on campus. Each leader was asked, “Does calling for the genocide of Jews violate your rules, conduct codes, or harassment policies?” All attempted nuanced answers. For example, was the call for genocide targeted at an individual, thus amounting to harassing conduct, or was it mere vile speech?

Their answers, though legally sound, elicited a furious backlash. Stefanik called on the presidents to resign. The House passed a resolution calling the presidents “evasive and dismissive” and condemning “their failure to clearly state that calls for the genocide of Jews constitute harassment and violate their institutions’ codes of conduct.” Kathy Hochul, the governor of New York, wrote a letter to college presidents asserting that calls for genocide violate New York’s Human Rights Law, Title VI of the Civil Rights Act, and SUNY’s code of conduct; she threatened “enforcement action” if colleges and universities were found not in compliance. In Florida, Governor Ron DeSantis said that he wanted the college presidents to lose their jobs (the fate that befell Liz Magill, who resigned as Penn’s president because of that viral congressional hearing on anti-Semitism). Donald Trump and his administration would later target those same universities with anti-Semitism probes and regulatory actions that threatened billions of dollars in federal funding while severely constraining their autonomy.

For administrators at the University of Florida, who declined to comment while this litigation is ongoing, the message was presumably clear: If a student calls for the genocide of Jews, deciding whether to punish them based on whether the First Amendment technically protected the speech would be seen as suspect by federal and state officials––and might, if history repeated itself, result in job loss and significant funding losses.

Then along came Damsky with a social-media post that concluded, “Jews must be abolished by any means necessary.”

“Confronting the fact pattern in his case, an institution might well ask their legal advisers if they could justify punishing the speech,” Jackie Gharapour Wernz, an attorney who advises educational institutions about complying with nondiscrimination laws such as Title VI and Title IX, told me. And she could imagine a legal adviser signing off on a punishment, despite its risks. “If they act, they may get sued for violating free-speech rights,” she explained. “If they don’t act, they may face complaints or lawsuits from students or employees claiming they’re ignoring or contributing to a hostile environment. In a very real sense, the institution is choosing which lawsuit it wants.” Institutions may decide to consider a range of risks, she said, “including political pressure, federal attention, and backlash from different parts of the community, and sometimes those pressures drive decisions as much as the legal merits.” An institution might even want to lose in court, she said, “because that gives them cover later to say, We actually can’t punish this speech.”

Damsky’s lawyer, Anthony Sabatini, believes that the political climate is affecting what would normally be a simple case about unambiguously protected speech. “UF clearly tried to use heightened political concerns about antisemitism (or what gets called antisemitism) to pressure the district judge, as you’ll see in their pleadings,” he told me via email. “The Trump administration is clearly using Title VI to unlawfully attempt to stop lawful criticism of Israel by equating it with antisemitism and will lose in court on that.”

Of course, college administrators might also punish speech of the sort Damsky deployed out of a desire to oppose anti-Semitism or to protect the educational experience of Jews. Kenneth L. Marcus, the founder and leader of the Louis D. Brandeis Center for Human Rights Under Law, a legal organization focused on fighting anti-Semitism, argues that anti-discrimination law is a vital tool for protecting the rights of Jewish students and any others targeted on the basis of their race, color, or national origin. “Whenever we take seriously our civil-rights laws, there will be questions about conduct that falls in a gray area between protected speech and unprotected activity,” he told me. “Just because there are some tough cases doesn’t mean that we should throw out the rules altogether.”

It is dangerous, he argued, “to minimize threats and to assume that persons involved in threatening communications don’t mean what they’re saying seriously.” In the Damsky case, “administrators simply cannot wait for apparently violent threats to turn lethal before they take action,” he argued. “Can you imagine if the university had done nothing and then the speaker actually followed up on his apparent threat by making an actual effort to abolish Jews by any means necessary? The university would at a minimum be held liable for its failure to exercise due care, and it should be.”

While I agree with Marcus that “the world that we’re living in since October 7, 2023, is one in which Jewish Americans and others face continuing and real threats,” and that anti-Semitism must be fought in any healthy and morally decent society, there is no simple correlation between acts of violence and rhetoric of the sort Damsky spewed. His words clearly don’t meet the long-standing Supreme Court threshold for “true threats,” and insofar as a student is secretly planning violence, expulsion presumably wouldn’t stop them. I also doubt that compelling colleges to punish students like Damsky, despite the lack of a strong legal case, is an effective way to fight anti-Semitism.

While no one, least of all Jews, deserves to live in a world with anti-Semites, nonviolent ones included, we do live in such a world. In a country where Tucker Carlson and Candace Owens expose massive audiences to the most nonsensical conspiracy theories, and as vile an anti-Semite as Nick Fuentes has more than 1 million followers on X, insulating schools from anti-Semitism is impossible. Administrators cannot make it disappear. They can, however, help students improve at countering bad ideas.

The academic philosopher Dan Williams recently argued that establishment institutions “have clung to a set of habits and norms—most fundamentally, an aversion to engaging with illiberal ideas to avoid ‘platforming’ and ‘normalising’ them—adapted to a world that no longer exists.” From his perspective, which I find persuasive, the modern internet makes this sort of aversion unwise: Gatekeepers don’t exist in the digital era, and “once established institutions lost the privilege to control the public conversation, they acquired an obligation to participate within it.” I’d feel more hopeful about the ability of American institutions to adapt if universities prepared the rising generation to rebut history’s worst ideas rather than trying to suppress them.

If Damsky returns to law school, some classmates will treat him as a social pariah who deserves scorn. Some will fear for his everlasting soul as he transgresses morality by indulging hatred. To forbear bigots is no easy thing, and it is not for me to judge how others do it. But I hope some of his classmates would use the presence of an anti-Semitic white nationalist to hone the strongest and most persuasive arguments against his views. I hope some would study the example of Daryl Davis, the Black musician who has successfully talked multiple members of the Klu Klux Klan into giving up their hoods, and that others would follow the example of the New College of Florida students who converted a white-nationalist classmate into an anti-racist activist.

Anti-discrimination laws have a role to play in academia: College administrators have an obligation to ensure that no student is denied educational opportunities on the basis of their race, religion, ethnicity, or national origin, and that, insofar as their student bodies include bigots, they don’t harass or bully Jews or anyone else. But the policing of speech that is protected by the First Amendment is both unlawful and insufficient. Perhaps, in a world where hateful speech can be distributed to mass audiences more easily than ever before, it’s even counterproductive.</div>

            <h2>How the Bernie Goetz Shootings Explain the Trump Era</h2>

            <div id="article-text">Without Trumpism, Democrats and anti–Donald Trump conservatives tell themselves, America can once again be the nation it always was. This political moment, many feel certain, is an aberration, an unfortunate detour from who we are and what we stand for. Surely, they hope, if the MAGA Republicans can just be unseated in this fall’s midterm elections, then once Trump leaves office, this country can get back on track.

But the political space we inhabit has deep roots. It did not erupt out of nowhere in 2016. The racialized rage and contempt for the rule of law that so thoroughly mark the present are the products of a longer political project set in motion during the 1980s, when the Reagan Revolution—itself anchored in white resentment—recast racial violence as necessary and defensible, restoring to it a legitimacy that had not been seen since the Jim Crow era and the Gilded Age.

Clint Smith: Those who try to erase history will fail

One particularly notorious event, which took place four decades ago on a New York City subway car just three days before Christmas, both reflected and fueled this dramatic political shift. On December 22, 1984, a downtown-bound 2 train rattled out of the 14th Street station, its walls layered in graffiti, its riders reading newspapers or staring silently in the exhausted intimacy of a city still struggling to rebound from a major fiscal crisis in the 1970s—and finding this new decade even more challenging.

On the subway car that day were four Black teenagers who lived in the same housing project in the heart of the South Bronx—Darrell Cabey, James Ramseur, Barry Allen, and Troy Canty. This neighborhood had been especially ravaged in recent years: recreational opportunities ended, public libraries closed, streets left grim by an illegal economy of drugs and sex that had become one of the few remaining ways to make money. With little else to do on what was an unseasonably balmy afternoon, this group of friends decided to head into Manhattan. Their plan for the day was modest and desperate at once—to stop at a video arcade, jimmy open a few coin receptacles, and come away with at least a few stolen dollars in their pockets.

Seated in the same car, directly across from two of the teenagers, was a white loner named Bernie Goetz. A 37-year-old single, self-employed electronics nerd living in Greenwich Village, Goetz was also trying to simply live his life in a city coming apart at the seams. He still had a decent income and a roof over his head, but Goetz’s own material security did not temper the growing resentment he felt every time he stepped outside his apartment and onto city streets. Disconcerting numbers of unhoused people were in Union Square Park, and visibly ill men—gaunt, with lesions and ragged coughs—streamed each day into the emergency room at the nearby St. Vincent’s Hospital. Meanwhile, trash littered the sidewalks and piled up on stoops, and the illicit economy seemed to occupy every corner.

Goetz understood this disorder not as the product of scant civic resources or state retreat but rather as the result of liberal misrule—do-gooder bureaucrats, failed social programs, and a city that had coddled the undeserving and the criminal. He had long since concluded that ordinary men like him would just have to look out for themselves.

When he took his seat on the 2 train that Saturday, Goetz had just spent a frustrating morning working on a piece of electrical equipment and had decided to head downtown for a bit. As he now regularly did, he was carrying a loaded .38-caliber Smith & Wesson hidden in a quick-draw holster inside his waistband.

Canty took in the white guy who had boarded at Union Square, paused the fooling-around that he had been doing with his friends—slapping at the plastic straps that hung from the ceiling of the train car, joking loudly—and greeted the man. Encouraged when he got a terse “Fine” after a “How are you?” Canty asked if the man had $5. He didn’t mind panhandling. That had become a way of life for the city’s poorest residents, young and old alike.

Allen was even more encouraged when this man stood slowly, turning as if he might be getting his wallet. But then Goetz swung back around, assumed a combat stance, and began firing.

Within seconds, Goetz shot Canty in the chest and Allen, who had been standing nearby, in the back as he tried to flee. Goetz next aimed his weapon at Ramseur and then Cabey, who sat farther down the car. He hit Ramseur, who was also trying to run. The bullet pierced Ramseur’s arm and entered his chest through his side. But Goetz’s fourth bullet missed Cabey, and the shooter was, as he later made clear, determined to take every one of the kids out.

As Cabey cowered in his seat, Goetz walked over to him and said, “You seem to be all right. Here’s another,” before shooting at him again from point-blank range.

Goetz didn’t kill these teenagers, but not because he hadn’t tried. He later said, “If I had more bullets, I would have shot ’em all again and again. My problem was I ran out of bullets.”

Yet this man, who then disappeared into the tunnels of the NYC subway system and remained on the lam for nine days, was not reviled as a vicious and violent criminal by a stunning number of New Yorkers, particularly white ones. Goetz became an overnight celebrity, heralded as a real-life “Death Wish Vigilante,” a reference to the blockbuster movies of this era, in which Charles Bronson plays a regular white guy who chooses to meet urban threats with lethal force. Here was a man who had had enough, who had done what others wished they could.

Goetz’s victims were, in turn, villainized and bombarded with hate mail. No matter that these young people were all only 18 or 19, and also unarmed and slight, the tallest of them only 5 feet 6 inches. No matter that Goetz had severed Cabey’s spinal cord and permanently paralyzed him from the waist down. No matter that Ramseur was found dead, likely from suicide, on an anniversary of this horrific event, and that Allen would descend into drug addiction.

They were deemed thugs and animals, and were said to symbolize all that was wrong with America’s cities as well as with the liberals who had enabled the city’s poor, lazy, and criminal elements. They were proof that hard-working Americans were under siege. These teens had gotten exactly what they deserved.

But the public’s reaction to the subway shooting was neither obvious nor inevitable; it was actively cultivated. Doing much of the work to normalize hatred and violence after the event were conservative, misinformation-driven media that were themselves aggressive and ascendant. The Goetz case was a long-awaited opportunity, particularly for the conservative Australian media mogul Rupert Murdoch, who dreamed of making his paper the New York Post the dominant tabloid in NYC and then taking over the entire U.S. news-media market.

From the moment that Goetz pulled the trigger on Cabey, Ramseur, Allen, and Canty, columnists from both the New York Post and the other major New York tabloid trying to hold its own, the Daily News, framed the case as a referendum on self-defense rather than an act of attempted murder. Even though the teens were the ones in ICUs and Goetz had been carrying an illegal weapon on the train that day, they were the “predator” and he was the “prey.”

During the 1980s, both tabloids pandered to the racial resentments and fears of white New Yorkers when covering all of the city’s ills. The New York Post seemed to practically invite readers to cheer for acts of white rage—in the Goetz case and the brutal white-mob killings of Black New Yorkers in Howard Beach and later in Bensonhurst—as well as to steadfastly ignore the civic wreckage that had paved the way for such acts of lawlessness in the first place.

Facts had begun to matter less and less. For example, even though it was fiction, a story that the teenagers Goetz shot were wielding sharpened screwdrivers soon became gospel in tabloid and mainstream press alike. This very much mattered to how the public felt about the case.

But what mattered more was a political shift that was taking place, one that had made it possible for the right-leaning media to profit so handsomely off the resentment and rage of ordinary people.

In 1980, Ronald Reagan took the White House. He insisted that government was bloated and inefficient, that liberal social programs bred only dependency and crime, and that law-abiding citizens, implicitly white, had been abandoned in favor of a lazy “underclass,” often marked explicitly as Black. The Reagan administration counted on Murdoch’s newspapers to hammer away at these messages on its behalf.

According to Reagan Republicans, America’s problems could be solved by cutting federal spending, slashing taxes, and gutting regulations on business. If the rich thrived, their argument went, the benefits would trickle downward to the nation as a whole.

The desire to do all of these things was not new—it had long animated the ambitions of the country’s wealthiest Americans. Ever since the New Deal had constructed a meaningful social safety net in response to the devastation of the Great Depression, the rich had sought to weaken labor, shrink the public sector, delegitimize redistributive social policies, deregulate finance and industry, and drive taxes lower. They had long insisted that private control of public life simply made sense.

Yet it was politically risky for any administration to openly slash the tax base that funded public schools, affordable housing, city services, and public-health systems. As jobs disappear, wages fall, housing and health care grow scarce, and education becomes an engine of debt, people might not only be left poorer; they also might demand accountability and redress.

Reagan Republicans fully understood the political risks of dismantling more than 50 years of public policy, yet—more effectively than any of their predecessors—they succeeded in manufacturing the popular consent needed to do precisely that. The key to this achievement was a simple but devastating insight: The most effective way to discredit liberal social policy was to starve it of resources and then point to its inevitable failure. As the Reagan aide James Cicconi explained in an internal memo, the era of “decreasing governmental resources” would make  the “liberal approach” to governance “impossible to sustain financially.” This would force the adoption of “alternatives.”

With each passing year of the 1980s, this engineered collapse was recast as proof that the nation’s problems flowed from liberal social, political, and racial policies, and from the supposed moral failures of people who, it was claimed, simply did not want to work. Inequality was framed as meritocracy.

As the Reagan Revolution matured, taxes were slashed and regulations rolled back; in turn, the social programs and city services upon which ordinary Americans depended were devastated. And as the rich grew richer and the lives of ordinary people grew more difficult, the narratives emanating from the White House down continued to blame the deepening crisis—the rise in homelessness, the AIDS epidemic, the garbage-strewn streets, the turn to illegal economies—not on policy choices but on bad people. Crime, disease, and addiction were cast as moral failures rather than as the predictable consequences of political decisions.

Arguments such as these distracted the public from rethinking the true cost of stripping public coffers and actively widening the country’s income gap. In this sense, politicians interested in remaking the economy in ways more favorable to the rich did not merely rely on racialized resentment; they also helped ensure that anger would be directed downward, toward those even less fortunate than themselves.

White Americans in particular were offered a Faustian bargain during the Reagan ’80s: accept a thinner safety net, a harsher economy, and a more unequal society—but in return, receive the emotional satisfaction of seeing the “right” people punished by an ever-expanding criminal-justice system, and the tacit assurance that if they happened to visit their own frustrations on someone who did not look like them, that same system would protect them.

Ultimately, the fueling of racial fear did extraordinary political and cultural work, fixing public attention on crime rather than wage theft, on disorder rather than deregulation, on punishment rather than the public good. The Goetz saga proved just how effectively narratives of crime, and outright misinformation, could be used to discredit government, justify inequality, and legitimize extrajudicial violence—all while claiming the mantle of common sense.

When he was finally apprehended, Goetz claimed that he had no regrets for what he did. He made no apologies for wanting “to kill those guys; I wanted to maim those guys; I wanted to make them suffer in every way I could”—not because his victims were armed (they were not), but because he felt besieged and abandoned, and thus justified in striking back. He railed at the assistant district attorney who took his statement: The subway system was “a disaster,” crime in the city was “a disaster,” and the government in charge of all of it was “a disgrace.”

Goetz’s journey through the justice system reinforced the idea that his worldview had merit. A grand jury was convened despite extraordinary public pressure to simply let him skate, and then it declined to indict Goetz on attempted-murder charges. However, word got out that Goetz had confessed to gunning down the teens, had told detectives that “robbery had nothing to do [with] it,” and, what is more, had admitted to shooting Cabey a second time. A second grand jury was convened that indicted Goetz for a range of serious charges, including attempted murder. In the trial that followed, however, a jury of Goetz’s peers decided that, despite the evidence mounted against him, he was guilty of only the most minor gun charges he faced.

Goetz served eight months in jail. The message sent to the American public was unmistakable: It is perfectly okay for at least some people to take the law into their own hands.

Goetz’s case helped build the early architecture of conservative tabloid media and inflammatory talk radio. This seeded the ecosystem of social media and Fox News coverage that, together, perfected the art of viral outrage and the mobilization of economic anxiety for political ends. And although mainstream news outlets did not openly revel in—or explicitly justify—the Goetz shootings, they did privilege coverage of urban crime and disorder over careful, sustained attention to the structural conditions and policy choices that made cities less safe and eroded the material security of ordinary people.

Equally significant was the fact that the economic and cultural transformation that this country had undergone since the 1980s was never a project confined to conservative politicians. Politicians across party lines contributed to the steady dismantling of America’s social safety net and the stoking of resentment and rage, even as they worked to channel these for their own partisan ends. Bill Clinton would deliver the most devastating blow to welfare; Trump would perfect the art of turning fear into fury.

We are still living today through the long Reagan Revolution: A teenager crosses state lines with an assault rifle and is hailed as a patriot for killing protesters; a mob storms the Capitol, convinced that violence is necessary to “save” democracy, and is pardoned; an ICE agent shoots and kills a mother and is said to have acted in self-defense, despite all evidence to the contrary; politicians denounce crime while simultaneously cutting the very social programs that ordinary people need to survive and that help sustain safe communities.

Gal Beckerman: Minnesota had its Birmingham moment

Trump did not invent these dynamics; he inherited them. He did not create the legitimacy of white grievance. And he did not usher in a new age of white racial violence or escalating income inequality; he has merely decided to unabashedly incite the former and defend the latter.

As the country moves toward the 2026 midterms, the temptation will be to treat our current racial, political, and economic crisis as a sharp break from the past; to search for singular villains; and to imagine that a return to normalcy is just one election away. But political cultures do not change course simply because their most flamboyant representatives enter or exit the stage.

The hard and necessary task now is to reckon with how past moments such as the Bernie Goetz shootings of 1984 helped remake the boundaries of how much racial violence, inequality, hatred, and indifference we as a society are willing to quietly endorse or even embrace. Only by confronting our history honestly can we begin to understand why appeals to fear remain potent, why calls for punishment eclipse demands for justice, and why the promise of democracy has been so unevenly realized.</div>

We don&#39;t even need a very good rule on XYZ,&quot; he said, according to the meeting notes. &quot;We want good enough.&quot; Zerzan added, &quot;We&#39;re flooding the zone.&quot;&#39;

This is self-satire.  &quot;Good enough&quot;?  Good enough for what?  &quot;Government work&quot;?  The point of that joke is that it&#39;s not really good enough!

And &quot;We&#39;re flooding the zone&quot;?  The end of that sentence is &quot;with shit&quot;.  That&#39;s not me editorializing.  That&#39;s just a fact.

If text requires no thought to write, if it contributes no semantic data, it shouldn&#39;t be written in the first place.

The more I hear about this, the more I think that the &quot;AI Revolution&quot; is really just people not knowing how to type.

Also, when rules are being written thoughtlessly, the fact that you can write them faster is BAD.  Everybody KNOWS that, right?  Because then you&#39;ve got tons of thoughless rules.  That&#39;s bad!  That&#39;s clearly bad!

I come here to concur on your argument on the thoughtless rules. This is so incredible it has to be an April 1st joke.

This should tell you all you need to know about not only Trump administrations view of law and administrative procedure but law in general.

So very very much of it exists not because its good, needed, or even makes sense but for its own sake and to be purposefully vague so that it can be twisted to mean whatever the hell bureaucrats in charge want to mean at any given time.

Honestly no free society should tolerate this. We should create a constitutional amendment that requires fines and penalties vary inverse

This &quot;full steam ahead damn the consequences&quot; attitude scares me.

They took care of content distribution. They took care of international sales / taxes / etc. They took care of currency conversions. They took care of folks who wanted returns (not many, but still).

They made my game accessible world-wide with almost zero effort on my part.

Did I give them a 30% commission to sell my game? Yes. Would I like that percentage to be lower? Sure. Would I call it excessive? Hell no. Especially since retail stores get a similar cut, and I didn&#39;t have to worry about manufacturing, distribution, stock, returns, etc.

Yeah I don&#39;t understand this recent backlash against Steam. They provide an amazing service. They&#39;re #1 because all competitors were horrible. I still remember when services like EA Downloader and Direct2Drive would try to charge you an additional fee for &quot;download insurance,&quot; otherwise you couldn&#39;t re-download your game. Valve never pulled stuff like that, just consistently gives a great customer experience. Is all this just paid-for FUD from Epic?

The conclusion of your comment is also my conclusion on the subject, or very close to it. There are plenty of interested parties, the funding didn&#39;t have to come from epic games. Since valve is by far the best at what they do the other players can&#39;t outcompete them.

There was a local forum about houses etc, and a 800+ post thread with &quot;glorious&quot; photos from real estate agents. It wasn&#39;t just altered photos but also weird camera angles and odd photos. My favourites:- TV lying on its side in the basement for storage. With the picture on.- Several photos of the garden but none that showed the whole thing. In one of the photos inside you could see out of the window that the garden photos avoided a 1 meter tall light-blue concrete snail sculpture.- Stove top edited to look

The fools who buy houses like it&#39;s something on amazon are why we need laws like this.  My neighbor bought his house online without looking at it and it sits empty because they ended up disliking it. They didn&#39;t move in just looked at it once and realized they couldn&#39;t fit and his wife never has been seen again after that 1st visit.

I really can’t find fault here. If you doctor photos then you have to provide the originals. How is that bad?

We don&#39;t need laws to protect him, obviously, if he can afford to buy a home he doesn&#39;t need. In fact we need laws for protection FROM people like him, who are reducing the housing supply. The solution is an empty unit tax.

The real estate agent is happy to have a busy open house.  Everyone else suffers from wasted time, inefficient markets, and occasionally being suckered into a bad deal.

They should have added a provision in the law that expressly forbids making any property photo look like a creepy glowing Thomas Kinkade painting. That would cover most of the issues.

Although they should also ban using whatever software straightens out all the curved lines in their ultra-fisheye lens images. It just don&#39;t look right.

Don&#39;t most &quot;physical copies&quot; nowadays just come with an essentially empty disc? For example, the physical release of Doom: The Dark Ages had no data on disc, just a stub so it could validate you own the game and let you download it. Pretty shady, but you&#39;d have had to download a 100GB day-zero patch anyways so why put anything on the disc at all?

Could someone please elaborate on the entire point of releasing a digital version and a &quot;boxed&quot; version at different times?  The hell is the difference and why are fans excited about that concept?  Do I get trading cards and limited edition stickers in the landfill version, with the added bonus of waiting weeks longer for it?

I&#39;m guessing this is a move buried in pointless capitalistic greed driven by bullshit hype that executives hope will still work on an audience who didn&#39;t exactly wait around to make Duk

Some people like to collect physical objects. That includes a box, even if it&#39;s empty. There&#39;s still a market for it, so they&#39;ll sell it. The days of being able to play a game offline entirely from the disc are long gone, though.

Because you need to print and have the physical copies ahead of time...Using the word &quot;need&quot; here, is a bit laughable in the 21st Century that has already distributed digital-only games.

Offering an effectively empty box at a big markup is definitely anti consumer. But that&#39;s true of literally any software sale where you don&#39;t get media you can install from without a network connection. A digital download that you can install from later without approval from a server is better than a disc where you can&#39;t, let alone no disc.

One could hope you got a version on a disc that you could run when their auth servers are long gone but that is probably not going to happen

Considering just how bad the single player game was for GTA 5, I&#39;m taking a pass on this next one...so I really don&#39;t care about the release.

What was so bad about the single player game? It was fine, and a lot of fun. It didn&#39;t get all of the additions that online got over the years, but considering the stupid shit like flying motorcycles that was added, that isn&#39;t really a bad thing.

We all know that any physical release of a game as big as GTA6 is going to need a day-one patch anyway. So make it that the game wont play until it&#39;s been patched.

If disks leak early, they will be useless to anyone until release day anyway.

Just the opposite--the article says: &quot;It rapidly became clear that the Marconi system was far superior and Baird&#39;s was dropped after just three months.&quot;

The Baird system was just an evolution of the Nipkow disc from the 1880s.  It took more than 40 years for someone to make it even somewhat viable for some reason, but if you include mechanical transmission, I&#39;d argue that it was invented in 1883.

But practically speaking, I would say that the 100-year anniversary of TV is in 2027, 100 years after Farnsworth transmitted the first electronically scanned TV signal.

The Marconi system (1930s) was an improved version of Farnsworth&#39;s system from 1927 (as proven by patent lawsuits).

So that&#39;s how young TV is.  Analog transmission stopped in 2009, 3 years after google bought youtube, and on-demand viewing started to dominate within 5 or 10 years.  So the effective lifetime of  &quot;TV&quot;

Sadly, his business failed because his television lacked any internet connectivity that would have enabled him to monetize his users&#39; personal info.

And there wasn&#39;t any porn available on it.

Which explains why there wasn&#39;t any porn. But doesn&#39;t change the fact that porn has made a lot of new technologies successful.

He chose the creepiest image he could find, seemingly.

Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Customs and Border Protection agents have now killed two U.S. citizens in Minnesota under the made-up banner of “absolute immunity” for federal law enforcement officials, regardless of what they do or how they do it. The notion of immunity for state actors in American law goes back decades, and much of what we are seeing on the ground now in terms of violent immigration enforcement has its antecedents in long-standing and deeply flawed American ideas about good guys versus bad guys and who bears the burden of law enforcement run amok. On this week’s Amicus podcast, as the nation struggles to process the executions of Renee Good and Alex Pretti, Dahlia Lithwick was joined by Alex Reinert, the Max Freund Professor of Litigation and Advocacy at Cardozo School of Law. Their conversation has been edited and condensed for clarity.

Dahlia Lithwick: ICE agents, like all federal agents, are protected by qualified immunity, and that protects them from lawsuits for constitutional violations committed in the course of duty. And we’ve had that for a long time. Help us understand this foundational idea that for the most part, law enforcement officers cannot be held liable for their actions when they violate your rights. How did we get here?

Alex Reinert: Really, there are two foundational ideas in play in these cases involving federal officials. One is what I’m about to talk about, which is qualified immunity, and a second is something called Bivens doctrine, which is a common law doctrine that used to allow people to sue federal officials for constitutional violations. Let’s start with qualified immunity, which is not long-standing in the sense that it’s really a modern introduction to the law of constitutional torts. It was introduced by the Supreme Court in 1967 in the context of a Freedom Riders case. That was the context in which a lawsuit was brought against state and local officials, and the Supreme Court basically said: We think, even though Congress didn’t spell it out in detail in a statute that gave you the right to sue these officials, and even though Congress didn’t say anything about an immunity doctrine, we think this common law doctrine that may have existed in 1871 should be incorporated into our constitutional tort regime. Fast-forward to 1982, which is where we got a case called Harlow v. Fitzgerald. In that case the Supreme Court said: We also think there should be an immunity doctrine that applies to federal officials.

What it means in practice is that any officer—whether state, local, or federal—who violates the Constitution won’t be held liable unless there is some prior case that makes it clear, from a court’s perspective, that the officer’s conduct was obviously a violation of the Constitution.

So qualified immunity is only really used, or it really only has an impact, when an officer is violating the Constitution. If officers don’t violate the Constitution, they don’t need the protection of qualified immunity. It’s only when officers violate the Constitution that they are able to obtain the protection of qualified immunity.

On its face, if you explained it to somebody and said that we should only hold officers liable when they were on reasonable notice of the unlawfulness of their conduct, people might look at it and think that makes sense. In practice, it has been applied in the widest range of circumstances where most people would say: How is it possible? How is it possible that somebody could get immunity when, for instance, they’re ordered by their supervisor not to fire a shot and they fire six shots and kill someone? When they are executing a search warrant and they decide to steal about $200,000 worth of valuables and a court says, Well, there’s qualified immunity because there wasn’t a prior case in point saying that when you’re executing a search warrant, you can’t steal money? Those are the kinds of cases in which qualified immunity comes into play.

It’s probably shocking to the ordinary person that in this country, a country purported to be governed by the rule of law, and where the Constitution is thought of as foundational, it turns out that violations of the Constitution by our highest-level officers and officials aren’t remediable because of this doctrine of qualified immunity.

Explain Bivens doctrine now, to set the table for what follows.

This is the other part of what is a perverse design of our constitutional scheme. Bivens is special because it applies only to federal officials. When state and local officials violate our rights, there’s a statute that goes all the way back to Reconstruction enacted in 1871 that allows us to sue state and local officials for violations of our constitutional rights. Qualified immunity still applies, but at least there’s a right to sue. There is no similar statute when federal officials violate the Constitution.

In 1971, in a case by the name of Bivens, the Supreme Court said: We think that we are going to find a right to sue in the Fourth Amendment, for Fourth Amendment violations when federal officials violate someone’s rights. Over the course of the next 10 years, the Supreme Court expanded that doctrine to include Eighth Amendment violations, and claims for sex discrimination. During the 1970s, lower courts were also rapidly expanding the Bivens doctrine.

All that changed in 1980. From 1980 on, the Supreme Court said: We are not going to entertain Bivens actions. And the court has given us a variety of reasons to the point where today, when the Supreme Court hears a Bivens claim, it basically says: We’re not sure that this court would even recognize the right to sue federal officials for constitutional violations. We’re certainly not going to extend that right to sue beyond the narrow category of the three cases in which the Bivens right was recognized in the 1970s. Furthermore, we’re going to confine those categories very narrowly.

I come back to this principle that we have a Constitution that is supposed to be meaningful in this country and it’s supposed to govern the conduct of all of our officers. It’s perverse that we have a federal Constitution that means less for federal officials than it does for state and local officials. We have a federal Constitution that is harder to enforce against federal officials than almost anyone else. That’s really a product of the Bivens doctrine.

And the last piece of this that I think is really important, just historically, for people to understand is that this wasn’t the model of remediation we had in the 19th century. You could sue federal officers in the 19th century when they violated your rights. It was not a unique occurrence. It was accepted that this was a way for people to obtain remedies. It also was accepted that it was a way to test the legality of executive conduct, of the policies and conduct of federal officials. Now we live in this world in which there are so many barriers to that kind of accountability, to those tests for legality.

That’s just a bad way to design courts. We want to learn from our mistakes. We want law to be able to develop if it should. It’s also bad, obviously, for people who are bringing these kinds of claims. I also think  it’s bad for policing. We want police to do their job consistent with the Constitution. Having answers to the question of when they violate rights and when they don’t should be, and is, important to them. So we’re losing all these opportunities in these cases to develop the law in ways that I think should help everyone.

Last week the AP reported a whistleblower complaint that showed that in violation of long-standing Fourth Amendment principles, ICE is taking the position that they can just enter folks’ homes without a judicial warrant. They can just use an administrative warrant. The whistleblower complaint alleges that the secret memo outlining this policy, signed by acting deputy ICE Director Todd Lyons, says, “although the U.S. Department of Homeland Security has not historically relied on administrative warrants alone to arrest aliens subject to final orders of removal in their place of residence, the DHS Office of General Counsel has recently determined that the U.S. Constitution, the INA, and the immigration regulations do not prohibit relying on administrative warrants for this purpose.”

I think it is extremely concerning and also an untenable interpretation of the Fourth Amendment. The Supreme Court hasn’t addressed this question, but the whole premise of the warrant requirement is that there should be some independent adjudicator—someone outside the executive branch—to decide whether or not there is a justification for invading the sanctity of someone’s home. Administrative warrants don’t provide that; judicial warrants do. That doesn’t mean judicial warrants are perfect, but they are at least outside the executive branch. It’s important from a separation-of-powers perspective, of course, and it’s important from an institutional design perspective. We already have so much about the immigration system over which the executive has so much authority: the appointment of immigration judges, all of these policy memos. So to fold the power to issue warrants, and act on warrants, into the executive in this way is just an extreme power grab. And the line about use of force gets us back to what we were talking about with Bivens and qualified immunity, which is when the officers use force in those circumstances, when they go overboard in their use of force—as inevitably some will—what kinds of remedies will there be? Those will be few and far between.

It reminds me of Justice Kavanaugh’s concurrence in Noem v. Vasquez-Perdomo, where he says, essentially, People are talking about use of force, but this case isn’t about use of force. If there is a use of force, then people should be able to go to court and sue. He says all that in his concurrence, but at the same time we know that Justice Kavanaugh is one of the justices who has led the charge for undermining the Bivens remedy. It’s exactly what the Supreme Court does in so many contexts in the civil rights world. They’ll say: We’re not going to give you this remedy here, but don’t worry. There’s all these other ways you can enforce your rights. And then when they’re over there in the other box, they say: Well, we’re not going to allow you to enforce your rights here because there’s something else over here. Pam Karlan calls it a shell game and it works like this: When I’m over here, I’m going to say, Don’t worry about me limiting your rights because there’s some other way for you to enforce them. And then I’m just going to undermine your means of enforcing them in that other part of the jurisprudence. So it is troubling to the extreme that ICE officers are going to be acting on this authority.

Since 2020, and the murder of George Floyd and the flash of recognition that police reform was past due, there has been a significant public silence. As a consequence, in that silence, we have to grapple with that which makes us very uncomfortable. By “we” I mean a culture that has turned a blind eye to a lot of these issues and is suddenly startled by the ways police immunity and impunity have been weaponized for immigration enforcement. So help us think through reform in ways that are conducive to meaningful accountability and conducive to having a civic life that doesn’t include masked officers pepper-spraying or shooting somebody who’s already restrained on the ground. How do we think in a bigger, more generous way about getting to where we want to be?

I guess I would think about it in at least two different ways. The first is part of the reason there’s resistance to increasing accountability, particularly for our policing apparatus. It has to do with the sense that it’s a hard job. And it’s a job that at some level, most people think we need people to do. And what do we do when something that people see as really important, that’s also hard, what do we do when that imposes costs? When that imposes costs on people who did nothing wrong, who are left traumatized, maybe dead, seriously injured? I’ve always thought that the problem with a lot of the doctrine we’ve been talking about is it leaves those costs on the people who suffered them. It leaves those costs directly on the people who suffered them. But if we allow it, if we think there’s something good that comes out of policing, if we think it creates some value for the public at large, why should the costs be borne solely by the people who suffered most significantly as a result of it? So that’s one piece of it that always resonates with me about why some of the doctrine we’ve been talking about is so wrong.

For a while, or at least for I don’t know how long of a moment after the murder of George Floyd, there was a conversation. I would go to demonstrations and I’d see signs that said “End qualified immunity.” There was a way in which the doctrine that previously mostly lawyers knew about or scholars were talking about and mostly other people didn’t know about, that doctrine came into the public consciousness and became important. I think there is still some of that going on. I think there is still some momentum for that.

When we think about accountability, we usually think about accountability for an individual, an individual who behaved in some unlawful way. It makes sense to think about accountability that way. But the problems we’re talking about are systemic. That doesn’t mean there aren’t some individuals, the so-called bad apples, who no matter what kind of training we have, no matter what way we approach hiring, no matter what kind of supervision we provide, there are some people who may just act egregiously because they can, because they have a badge. But I think for the most part, the problems we’re talking about are systemic. And if the problems are systemic, then talking about accountability for individuals isn’t necessarily the right frame. I think we need to approach solutions to the problem systemically. And those solutions are as much about: Who ends up paying the damages for the people who suffer? Should it be the individual officer or should it be the departments that employ them? As a matter of practice, it’s always the departments who employ them. So we need to find a way for those agencies to learn better from the kinds of misconduct that their officers enter into. But it’s also about the legal regime that we set up to allow people to sue and what kinds of things they sue for, the way we allow people, really limit the ability of people, to bring so-called injunctive relief and systemic reform of departments.

So if we think about accountability more broadly, and we think about the problems we’ve been talking about, through a systemic lens, it’s not so much about the individual officer. It’s about creating a legal regime that allows us to get answers to the questions of how people were mistreated, whether the way in which they were mistreated was unlawful, and making sure that we can build systems so that it doesn’t keep happening. Because right now we’re in a world where it is happening over and over again and it seems like there are very few tools in our toolbox to prevent the reoccurrence.

Early Saturday morning, it appeared as if enough Senate Democrats were willing to fund the Department of Homeland Security and its deportation machine, if that’s what it took to keep the rest of the government open.

The House had passed funding for the DHS late last week, with seven centrist Democrats joining nearly all Republicans to get it over the line. The Senate was to take it up this week alongside a handful of other funding bills. It was expected that, as with the House vote, enough Democrats would hold their noses and support it, even if it meant absorbing blowback from a furious Democratic base that has been dusting off the largely dormant “Abolish ICE” slogan. Democratic negotiators felt that approving full-year, carefully negotiated spending bills and reasserting Congress’ power of the purse over a freewheeling executive branch was the priority of the moment.

“There is much more we must do to rein in DHS, which I will continue to press for,” Sen. Patty Murray, the top Democrat on the Senate Appropriations Committee, said in a statement last Tuesday, once the deal was released. She listed some pittances she had secured in the DHS bill, such as more money for body cameras for Immigrations and Customs Enforcement. She knew, though, that wouldn’t ease any anger within the base. Ultimately, she leveled.

“But the hard truth,” she added, “is that Democrats must win political power to enact the kind of accountability we need.”

All of this changed on Saturday in Minneapolis, when Border Patrol agents killed 37-year-old observer Alex Pretti. All of this changed when videos showed Pretti subdued, being pepper-sprayed and then shot, over and over again, without brandishing the firearm that he was permitted to carry. All of this changed when, as after the killing of Renee Good, White House adviser Stephen Miller and DHS Secretary Kristi Noem absurdly described Pretti as a “domestic terrorist” or “assassin.” After Pretti’s killing and the administration’s eyesight-defying remorselessness over what happened, there was no way Senate Democrats could put their fingerprints on a bill to fund the administration’s deportation machine.

“I will NOT support the DHS bill as it stands,” Patty Murray said Saturday.

She was hardly the only one. Democrats who’ve previously broken from the pack to join Republicans in advancing government funding bills, like Sens. Tim Kaine, Catherine Cortez Masto, Angus King, and Jacky Rosen, all said the same. On the House side, meanwhile, one Democrat who had voted for the DHS funding bill, New York Rep. Tom Suozzi, offered a mea culpa on social media, saying that he had “long been critical of ICE’s unlawful behavior and I must do a better job demonstrating that.”

Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer put a bow on Democrats’ new posture Saturday night: Democrats would filibuster DHS funding without changes. And it didn’t sound like there was much handwringing about it.

Does this make a partial government shutdown, after funding lapses after Jan. 30, inevitable? Let’s say much more likely. The situation is complicated for reasons including, but not limited to, the weather.

The funding bill the Senate will be voting on does not just cover DHS. It combines half a dozen bills that the House has passed in January funding everything from the Pentagon to the State Department to the departments of Health and Human Services, Transportation, Education, Labor, and more. Although this package includes only half of the 12 yearly appropriations bills, the specific departments it includes—especially Defense and HHS—comprise a comfortable majority of annual spending.

Senate Democrats are calling on their Republican counterparts, in Schumer’s words, to “work with Democrats to advance the other five funding bills while we work to rewrite the DHS bill.” In other words, to strip DHS funding from the package, pass everything else, and then allow for more time to negotiate the DHS budget.

Would Republicans be willing to do this? They typically don’t take orders from Democrats. But Republican leaders, just as much as Democratic ones, don’t want appropriators’ delicate work on the biggest funding bills to get sent to an incinerator of fury. The New York Times reported Saturday that “recognizing the depth of Democratic rage,” Senate Republicans “immediately began examining whether they could separate the homeland security funding from the rest of the package and preserve the bulk of what had been a bipartisan deal to fund a large chunk of the government.” Maine Sen. Susan Collins, the chair of the Appropriations Committee, said her committee was “exploring all options.”

If—if—leaders in the Senate reach an agreement to amend the package, then there’s another problem: The House is on recess this week, and House Republicans’ leaders wouldn’t be particularly enthused about summoning members to Washington to revote on a package amended at Democrats’ request. Plus, a substantial portion of the continental United States is buried under a sheet of ice and snow, conditions that aren’t conducive to travel.

It’s important to note that a lapse in DHS funding wouldn’t impede deportation operations much. As Patty Murray repeatedly said when she was trying to push the deal through, ICE is sitting on substantial funds that were made available to it in Republicans’ party-line megabill last year.

Murray is still saying that, posting on Sunday that “Americans must be eyes wide open that blocking the DHS funding bill will not shut down ICE. ICE is now sitting on a massive slush fund it can tap, whether or not we pass a funding bill.”

“But,” she added, “we all saw another American shot and killed in broad daylight.” They’re not about to bless it with their votes.

On Saturday, Alex Pretti was pushed to the ground and fatally shot by federal agents. Video shows that, moments before, Pretti was holding a cellphone in one hand and had his other hand up. Pretti was 37 and worked as an ICU nurse at a VA hospital. He enjoyed biking and had a dog named Joule.

Later that day, What Next’s Mary Harris spoke to Dimitri Drekonja, a colleague and friend of Pretti’s, who remembers him as “a kind guy” who modeled cooperation and who, right out of school, took one of the hardest jobs available to nurses. Their conversation has been edited and condensed for clarity.

Mary Harris: How did you learn about what happened?

Dimitri Drekonja: We were at [my son’s ski] race in the morning, and one of the other parents said, “Did you hear there was another shooting?” It sort of filtered through: “It sounds like another shooting.” “Another person died.” And there was a lot of sort of like, “This is just heavy.” “Awful.”

And then we got back from the race, and on a group chat, someone said, “ICE executed Alex Pretti.” [Editor’s note: It later became clear that the officers were with Customs and Border Protection.] It was from our group that we had had when we had first hired him to be study staff on our research project. It was like, What? You have to be kidding me.

I had seen one of the videos. [In it,] you can’t see the defined definitions of someone’s face and recognize them. But once the name was out there and I saw the build, the facial hair, it’s like, Oh, shit, that was Alex.

People have asked, “Are you surprised that he was protesting?” And, in all honesty, no one can be surprised that anyone in Minneapolis is protesting. We see 80-year-olds out protesting. We see kids out protesting. The city is pretty, pretty pissed off about what is happening, and people are out there doing their civic duty of being out there peacefully protesting.

Have you been able to watch the videos? I can’t stop myself watching the videos.

I don’t know how you watch someone you know—

I have not sought them out. I mean, my wife has shown me some, like, “Oh, God, with this new view you can see …” I’ve seen a few that way. It’s awful.

You posted on social media that you were feeling white-hot rage. What do you do with that feeling in this moment?

Right now, delay going to dinner with friends because I don’t feel terribly sociable. I’ve been really appreciative of people who have been reaching out to say, “Hey, sorry to hear—sounds like Alex was a great guy. This is hard.”

I think other people are enraged. I think the worst thing right now would be to have random violence. I’ve been really proud of Minneapolis—the scope and scale of the protests, the fact that they have been peaceful.

The administration has said your friend must have been trying to kill officers. Is there something you want to tell people who may have that belief about Alex?

The thing that I would say is that I have known Alex for years. I’ve known him to be a kind guy, a guy quick with a laugh, a joke, willing to help. He has never shared a conspiracy theory or shared anger at a group or been unpatriotic. I mean, he is the kind of guy that you would want as your neighbor and your friend. I would be thrilled if he were to move into the house next door.

We have a shared interest in mountain biking. We were planning on going out together. I was always the one who was having to say, “No, sorry, my kid has a race this week. Can’t do it.” But we liked the same trail systems, and we talked about riding them.

I have observed him clinically. He is fabulous, he gives great assessments, he’s enthusiastic, he is smart, and I will just say that anybody going into the ICU fresh out of nursing school—you’re gonna deal with very sick patients. A [large] percent of the patients in the ICU will die, and you’ll have to deal with grieving, upset families. You’ll have to use all your skills to try to keep that person alive. To do that right out of nursing school is impressive.

Sometimes medicine is a hierarchical place. He was not like that, and I loved that. I would run into him, and he would say, “Hey, Dimitri, how’s it going? It’s good to see you again.” I love that he had that informal relationship. I love it was modeled for trainees who worked with us. Like, yeah, this is how you do it: You’re colleagues, you’re friendly, you are nice to each other, and you work well together.

Once again, federal agents have shot and killed a legal observer in Minneapolis. Once again, the shooting is on video. And once again, the Trump Administration has closed ranks around the officers. But could the fallout from Alex Pretti’s death be different? And Minnesotans want to know – when will the feds finally leave?

Early Saturday morning in downtown Minneapolis, 37-year-old Alex Pretti was killed by federal agents in full public view. Within hours, Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Customs and Border Protection officials released a familiar statement: An agent, they said, had acted in lawful self-defense against an armed and violent agitator. According to this narrative, Pretti instigated the violence that led to his death. A multitude of videos filmed by witnesses from multiple angles show this to be a lie.

They show Alex Pretti holding up his phone, filming as masked ICE and CBP agents shove demonstrators and pepper-spray the crowd. They show an agent shoving a woman in the street. They show Pretti stepping forward, without striking anyone or reaching for a weapon, attempting to shield the woman from the agent’s blows. They show an agent spraying Pretti directly in the face with chemical irritant. They show Pretti being tackled to the ground. They show six or seven agents piling on top of him, striking him while he lies immobilized. And they show one agent removing Pretti’s licensed handgun—which he was carrying in compliance with state law—from his waistband.

Then, while he remains pinned to the pavement, helpless beneath a mass of armed bodies, gunshots ring out. Agents scatter, and one of them appears to clap. Pretti does not get up. This is not self-defense. It is much more akin to an execution.

Pretti was a licensed, law-abiding gun owner and registered nurse who worked at a veterans hospital.

The sequence of events matters, not only because it starkly contradicts the official account but because it exposes how the language of self-defense has been distorted to the point that it now functions as a near-automatic exoneration for state violence. When authorities invoke “self-defense” today, they rarely describe a factual necessity. They are deploying a rhetorical shield with deep historical roots and devastating contemporary consequences.

Just weeks earlier, on Jan. 7, Renee Good was shot three times and killed by an ICE agent as she attempted to flee in her car. In that case, too, officials framed the killing as justified and necessary, as self-defense rather than aggression. In that case, too, video evidence and eyewitness accounts—including an agent muttering “Fucking bitch” after the shooting—raised serious questions about the agents’ alleged “fear for their lives.” There is little to suggest that lethal force was unavoidable in this case, and yet Donald Trump’s Department of Justice is refusing to investigate the killing as a homicide. Instead, it is investigating Good’s widow. The pattern should be clear: Use an empty claim of self-defense to vindicate the shooter, then frame the victim as the perpetrator.

What we are witnessing is not a series of isolated tragedies. We have reached the logical end point of a political and legal culture that has long distorted claims of vulnerability, of “reasonable fear,” in the service of power, conflating aggressive, state-sanctioned violence with necessary self-protection.

From the nation’s founding, claims of self-defense have been used to justify extraordinary brutality. Systematic colonial violence against Indigenous nations was routinely rationalized as necessary to the protection of settler families and communities. Entire Indigenous communities were eradicated under the guise of lawful defense, with Indigenous resistance labeled “Savage Wars,” as a confrontation among equals rather than a genocidal onslaught.

After the Civil War, the Ku Klux Klan organized itself “to maintain forever the supremacy of the white race.” At the center of its mission lay the claim that white society required urgent protection from formerly enslaved people. Their founding documents emphasized “the sacred duty of protecting [white] womanhood” from sexual violence, with violence as necessary.

This mandate of protection congealed into widespread racial terror, claiming the lives of thousands of Black men, women, and children between Reconstruction and the mid-20th century. The Equal Justice Initiative estimates that 4,400 lynchings took place during this time period, which was also characterized by legalized segregation, mass disenfranchisement, economic coercion, and sexual violence perpetrated against Black women. And yet, when anti-lynching bills appeared before Congress—again and again—white leaders defended ritualized, spectacular acts of racial terror as a regrettable but necessary response to generally false claims of sexual violence by Black men against white women.

This “rape-lynch” mythology “that Negro men rape white women” was a “threadbare lie,” as journalist Ida B. Wells painstakingly documented in 1892, and she was almost murdered for speaking the truth. But truth was never the point. The claim of self-defense functioned as a form of camouflage to shroud the economic, political, and social project of keeping Black Americans subordinate under a blanket of legitimacy. It worked because enough people were willing to accept it, to pretend that racial terror was necessary to (white) public safety.

A similarly pernicious logic has insulated law enforcement from legal accountability for generations. Police violence, no matter how extreme, is routinely reframed as a defensive reaction to a threat rather than aggression. “The officer feared for his life.” “The suspect was reaching … for something.” “The situation escalated quickly, and the officer had no choice but to shoot.” The language is reflexive, ritualized, and remarkably effective. It is baked into our nation’s DNA to frame the victims of state-sanctioned violence as perpetrators.

In recent decades, that logic has been codified into law and expanded to select citizens through “Stand Your Ground” laws and permissive gun regulations that collapse the distinction between defense and dominance. These laws encourage armed confrontation while removing the legal duty to retreat or de-escalate. They transform subjective fear into legal justification while inviting ordinary citizens to imagine themselves as lone sentinels in a hostile world, as heroic “good guys with guns,” and as “armed citizens” exercising their Second Amendment rights. The laws reward those who act on that fantasy with legal immunity.

But only when they are acting in the service of repressive power. By all accounts, including the video evidence, Alex Pretti was a law-abiding good guy with a gun, who stepped in to protect an unarmed woman from an assault. He did not draw his weapon, nor did he attack the agents who disarmed him before shooting him multiple times while he was pinned to the ground.

What is new today is not the twisted rhetoric of self-defense but its escalation, and its targets. Masked federal agents, many of them poorly trained, now patrol public streets with military-grade weapons and broad discretionary authority. They detain, assault, and, increasingly, kill people based on vague or erroneous claims of public safety. They do so while invoking the same exonerating language that has long enabled state violence.

For generations, public state violence has been normalized precisely because it was disproportionately inflicted on nonwhite people, immigrants, low-income and other marginalized individuals. Many learned to look away or to justify this violence as the necessary price of “law and order.” Part of race and class privilege was the capacity to see such violence as a regrettable but necessary byproduct of maintaining order and keeping “us” safe.

We are now witnessing—some of us in incredulous horror—what happens when a society confuses authority with innocence and violence with virtue. We have built legal doctrines that reward escalation. We have granted weapons to institutions without demanding restraint. We have taught ourselves that “good guys” with guns will keep us safe from “bad guys.” Maybe now we are learning that the boundary separating the two was never clear in the first place.

            <h2>How one developer used Claude to build a memory-safe extension of C</h2>
            <p><strong>The Register | 2026-01-26</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2026/01/26/trapc_claude_c_memory_safe_robin_rowe/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">feature TrapC, a memory-safe version of the C programming language, is almost ready for testing.

&quot;We&#39;re almost there,&quot; Robin Rowe told The Register in a phone interview. &quot;It almost works.&quot;

We caught up with Rowe, a computer science professor and entrepreneur, amid debugging efforts that had kept him up until four in the morning. The long-awaited TrapC website has appeared.

&quot;My work building TrapC has taken two parallel paths,&quot; Rowe explains in his initial post. &quot;A TrapC interpreter called itrapc and a separate compiler called trapc. I had wanted to make a software release by 1 January 2026, but too many bugs. I only reached code complete this month and am now on the painstaking and sleepless process of debugging. When I have something stable that mostly works I will make a release. Sorry to make you wait a little longer. Aiming for Q1 2026.&quot;

Back in November 2024, Rowe explained that he was working on TrapC. At the time, the public and private sector had undertaken a campaign to promote memory-safe software development as a way to reduce exposure to serious vulnerabilities.

Memory safety provides a way of ensuring that memory-related bugs like out-of-bounds reads/writes and use-after-free don&#39;t happen. In large codebases, like Chromium and Windows, most of the security vulnerabilities follow from memory bugs. As that message has been repeated in recent years, memory safety has become an imperative, evangelized by the likes of Google and Microsoft, and more recently by authorities in the US and elsewhere.

For at least the past ten years, there&#39;s been a rising chorus of voices calling for the adoption of memory-safe programming languages and techniques. This has meant encouraging developers to avoid languages like C and C++ where feasible, and to adopt languages like C#, Go, Java, Python, Swift, and Rust, instead, particularly for new projects.

To remain relevant, the C and C++ communities have tried to address those concerns with projects like TrapC, FilC, Mini-C, Safe C++, and C++ Profiles. There&#39;s also a C to Rust conversion project under development at DARPA called TRACTOR – TRanslating All C TO Rust.

But progress has been slow and those writing in C and C++ haven&#39;t found a widely accepted approach. The C++ standards committee recently rejected the Safe C++ proposal. And Rowe said he doubted TRACTOR would have anything to show this year.

Meanwhile, the clock is ticking. Microsoft engineer Galen Hunt last month said, &quot;My goal is to eliminate every line of C and C++ from Microsoft by 2030. Our strategy is to combine AI and algorithms to rewrite Microsoft&#39;s largest codebases.&quot;

&quot;There are some efforts to port C code by hand to Rust,&quot; said Rowe. &quot;But there&#39;re some real challenges to doing that because there are some idioms in C that cannot be expressed in Rust.

&quot;Rust is much more type safe than C is. And so if you have a void pointer, what does that mean in Rust? There&#39;s no translation for it. And that&#39;s how TrapC is fundamentally different because it actually remembers what that void pointer actually is.&quot;

Rowe said he expects TRACTOR will eventually be able to accomplish C to Rust translation using AI. But he said he thinks it&#39;s better to just build the necessary tooling into the C compiler, so you don&#39;t have to rely on some external tool that rewrites your code in an unfamiliar language.

Rowe has been using AI tools himself and has been teaching others to do so. This past semester, he taught AI Cybersecurity Programmer Analyst (PCO471) at Community College of Baltimore County – Linux administration using vibe coding in bash with no prerequisites. And starting in February, he&#39;s teaching C++ Programming with Generative AI (PCO472) – vibe coding in C++.

Rowe said programming has fundamentally changed as a result of AI tools. &quot;I think this is sort of the same type of discussion as when C came in and people said, &#39;Well, I&#39;m happy in assembly.&#39; There will still be people doing it the old way. But because vibe programming is so much more efficient on time when done correctly, there&#39;s gonna be no choice. You just won&#39;t be competitive if you&#39;re not vibe programming.&quot;

Then he shifted gears, slightly. &quot;But I have to walk that back a little bit because the reason I was up until four in the morning is I had vibe programming working on the Trap C compiler. And it took a fundamentally wrong design turn. And I didn&#39;t detect that it had made a design mistake. I had told it how I wanted to approach it. But somehow it misunderstood me or it forgot or something happened and I forgot to check. And so I spent hours doodling around in the debugger and trying to understand why code was acting weird before I finally looked at it and said, &#39;wait a minute, this isn&#39;t even the right design.&#39;&quot;

Rowe said a similar situation crops up in pair programming, where you&#39;ve told someone to do something and they didn&#39;t do it, and you don&#39;t realize that until later.

&quot;[C++ creator] Bjarne Stroustrup famously said that the most important thing in software design is to be clear about what you&#39;re trying to build,&quot; Rowe said. &quot;And vibe [programming] just puts that on steroids. Now we not only have to be ourselves clear, but we have to communicate it clearly to an LLM.&quot;

Rowe argues that developers have to be encouraged to try AI tools and to make mistakes. He recounted how during his AI Cybersecurity Programmer Analyst course, his students expressed interest in doing more hands-on work in lieu of lectures.

&quot;So I said, &#39;I&#39;ve got real servers on the internet that are my companies. I&#39;ll give you root,&#39;&quot; he recalled. &quot;I&#39;ll set loose students who know nothing on my own servers and hope for the best and we&#39;ll see how this goes. And the reaction was panic. I couldn&#39;t get past the timidity cliff.&quot;

Rowe said that what he learned from that exchange was that they didn&#39;t want their own hands-on, they wanted to watch him work.

&quot;I said to them, &#39;But guys, this is like learning to play the piano. You can&#39;t learn to play the piano by watching me. Yeah, you guys have to practice. And it&#39;s gonna be embarrassing at first. You know, you&#39;re gonna play a lot of bad notes and sound terrible. You have to get over that situation&#39;.&quot;

That&#39;s a scenario playing out in various companies where AI tools remain underutilized, for various reasons, including lack of training, security concerns, lack of utility, and poor tool design.

Rowe has traveled often to China to speak at the China Association of Higher Education conference. In December, he said, he was interviewed on China News Television about how China&#39;s plan for AI compares with America&#39;s.

In an email he explained, &quot;I said, &#39;China&#39;s AI-Plus plan calls for efficient AI on devices everywhere, from farm to factory to city, while the White House plan calls for building 500-billion-dollar cloud data centers ... using chips that will, inevitably, seem obsolete within two years.&#39;&quot;

Rowe argues China&#39;s approach will prevail and that the US has taken the wrong turn by focusing on centralized cloud datacenters to run LLMs. Within two years, he said, we&#39;ll have AI models we can run locally on our phones, with no need for network access for most tasks. Apple and Huawei, he said, are likely to be the winners in this scenario.

Rowe pointed to China&#39;s DeepSeek as an example. While it may not be quite as good as the leading US commercial models, he said, it runs with far less power.

&quot;This is a very Moore&#39;s Law type of strategy,&quot; he said. &quot;I remember when I had a Navy supercomputer in 1994. That was an amazing technology. But in 1995, Cray went bankrupt. There weren&#39;t enough buyers for it, even though it was an amazing device.

&quot;And now I&#39;ve got an iPhone that&#39;s in my pocket. That runs on a battery. It doesn&#39;t have a whole room devoted to it and exotic cooling and all kinds of stuff. And it&#39;s more powerful than that [the Cray from 1994]. So as a long-term strategy, you know, going toward the device makes a lot more sense, because that half-trillion dollar data center is going to be on my iPhone eventually.&quot;

Rowe also said that on the recommendation of a friend from his time at the AT&T DIRECTV Innovation Lab, he tried running Deepseek at a time when Claude wasn&#39;t available. Deepseek, he said, was able to find a bug that Claude couldn&#39;t.

&quot;Surprisingly, the bug was in code Claude had generated, that I had cut-and-pasted carelessly,&quot; he said. &quot;With hindsight it was a silly code mistake I should have caught, but was in an &#39;else&#39; branch outside where I was looking. I&#39;d not expected or intended to have Claude make any change to that block of code. And because the code was valid but the logic wrong, the compiler didn&#39;t catch it.&quot;

But the bug was obvious, he said, as soon as Deepseek pointed it out. He added, &quot;I&#39;m paying $200/year for Claude. Deepseek is free.&quot; ®

            <h2>Microsoft's Maia 200 promises Blackwell levels of performance for two-thirds the power</h2>
            <p><strong>The Register | 2026-01-26</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2026/01/26/microsoft_maia_200/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Microsoft on Monday unveiled a new in-house AI accelerator to rival Nvidia&#39;s Blackwell GPUs.

Fabbed on TSMC&#39;s N3 process node, Redmond&#39;s second-gen Maia 200 accelerator packs 144 billion transistors capable of churning out a collective 10 petaFLOPS of FP4 performance.

That puts the chip in direct contention with Nvidia&#39;s first-generation Blackwell GPUs, like the B200 — at least in terms of inference.

According to Scott Guthrie, EVP of cloud and AI at Microsoft, the chip has been &quot;specifically optimized for inferencing very large models, including both reasoning and chain of thought.&quot;

Compared to training, inference is much more sensitive to memory bandwidth. For each token (think words or punctuation) generated, the entirety of the model&#39;s active weights needs to be streamed from memory. Because of this, memory bandwidth puts an upper bound on how interactive — that&#39;s how many tokens per second per user — a system can generate.

To address this, Maia 200 has been equipped with 216GB of high-speed memory spread across what appears to be six HBM3e stacks, good for a claimed 7TB/s of bandwidth.

To put that in perspective, Nvidia&#39;s B200 GPUs offer between 180 GB and 192 GB of HBM3e with up to 8 TB/s of bandwidth each. More recent iterations of Blackwell increase this to 288 GB but bandwidth remains the same.

Microsoft is also keen to point out just how much more cost- and power-efficient Maia 200 is than competing accelerators.

&quot;Maia is 30 percent cheaper than any other AI silicon on the market today,&quot; Guthrie said in a promotional video.

At 750 watts, the chip uses considerably less power than either Nvidia&#39;s chips, which can chew through more than 1,200 watts each. This is low enough that Microsoft says Maia can be deployed in either air- or liquid-cooled datacenters.

However, it&#39;s important to remember that Maia is an inference chip. So while it may compare favorably to Nvidia&#39;s older Blackwell parts, it&#39;s not nearly as versatile.

Diving into the chip&#39;s speeds and feeds, we see Microsoft has made some significant concessions in order to maximize performance per watt.

The chip&#39;s tile tensor unit (TTU), which Microsoft calls a tensor core, supports only FP8, FP6, and FP4 datatypes in hardware. So while we still see a 2x jump in FLOPS from FP8 to FP4, workloads requiring 16- or 32-bit precision incur a stiff performance penalty, as they have to be computed on the chip&#39;s tile vector processors (TVPs).

Here&#39;s a quick rundown of the Maia 200&#39;s speeds and feeds - Click to enlarge

The good news is most LLM inference is now done at lower precisions than BF16. In fact, it&#39;s not uncommon for model weights to be stored in a 4-bit block floating point precision like NVFP4 or MXFP4, while the actual activations and KV caches (the model&#39;s short-term memory) are computed at a higher precision like MXFP8 in order to maintain accuracy.

Nonetheless, Microsoft isn&#39;t lying about this chip being an inference accelerator. Despite some advancements in ultra-low precision training, most GenAI models are still trained at higher precisions, with BF16 still the most common.

All of this is to say, while Maia 200 may be Microsoft&#39;s most competitive AI chip to date, don&#39;t expect Redmond to cut back its Nvidia GPU orders any time soon, especially with Rubin promised to deliver a 5x uplift in inference performance compared to either Blackwell or Maia 200 launching later this year.

Maia 200 doesn&#39;t just deliver more performance and memory than last-gen, it&#39;s also designed to scale to support massive multi-trillion parameter models.

Each Maia 200 is equipped with 2.8 TB/s of bidirectional bandwidth (1.4 TB/s in each direction), which enables it to pool its compute and memory resources across clusters of up to 6,144 chips. That works out to 61 exaFLOPS of AI compute and 1.3 petabytes of HBM3e.

This is achieved using an integrated Ethernet network on chip (NoC), which by our estimates either has 56 200 Gbps or 112 100 Gbps SerDes each. Running atop this is Microsoft&#39;s own AI transport layer protocol.

As strange as this might sound at a time when Nvidia is pushing NVLink Fusion and AMD UALink, it&#39;s not the first time we&#39;ve seen Ethernet used this way. AMD is tunneling UALink over Ethernet on its MI455X series chips, and you may recall that Intel used Ethernet for chip-to-chip communications on its Gaudi family of AI accelerators.

As for Microsoft&#39;s scale-up topology, the cloud giant says it&#39;s using a two-tier scale-up domain, which involves Ethernet packet switches. To us this sounds like a two-layer fat tree topology normally associated with scale-out networks.

To avoid performance bottlenecks in larger clusters, Microsoft can dynamically partition the Maia 200&#39;s 272 MB of SRAM into cluster level (CSRAM) and tile-level (TSRAM) pools.

The CSRAM pool functions as a buffer for collective communications, avoiding unnecessary data transfers between the speedy on chip memory and HBM. The TSRAM, meanwhile, serves as a cache for intermediary matrix multiplication operations and attention kernels.

We&#39;ve reached out to Microsoft for clarification on both its scale-up topology; we&#39;ll let you know if we hear anything back.

In any case, Microsoft&#39;s networking is clearly designed to ensure it can run even the largest frontier models for its customers, and that includes OpenAI&#39;s GPT-5.2.

Maia 200 is already running in Microsoft&#39;s Central region in Des Moines, Iowa, with plans to bring it to its West 3 region in Phoenix and other locations in the near future.

Alongside the new chips, Microsoft has also launched an SDK in preview to provide prospective customers the tools they need to start integrating the chip into their workflows – sign up to request access here. The company says the chip will support both PyTorch and Triton kernels, which should lower the barrier to adoption. ®

            <div id="article-text">TikTok&#39;s new life under majority American ownership is off to a rough start, after users complained of widespread service disruptions the company blamed on a datacenter power outage.

Users began reporting problems with TikTok&#39;s app and website on Sunday. Many took to Reddit to say that they couldn&#39;t post and were unable to access their feeds, and when they could, they were finding garbage and unusual posts. Others posted that view counts were stuck at zero, suggesting something was definitely wrong days after a new majority American-owned joint venture was set up to operate key parts of TikTok&#39;s US business, following months of wrangling to get it out of Chinese hands.

The TikTok USDS (US Data Security) Joint Venture - the entity backed by Trump ally Larry Ellison&#39;s Oracle, private equity firm Silver Lake, and Emirati-backed investment firm MGX, with ByteDance retaining a minority stake - took to X on Monday to explain the issues as resulting from a power outage at a US datacenter.

&quot;Since yesterday we&#39;ve been working to restore our services following a power outage at a U.S. data center impacting TikTok and other apps we operate,&quot; the Joint Venture said. &quot;We&#39;re working with our data center partner to stabilize our service. We&#39;re sorry for this disruption and hope to resolve it soon.&quot;

The TikTok USDS Joint Venture confirmed the issue to The Register, explaining that the outage is impacting TikTok for US users, although we note that other self-reported TikTok users outside the US said on Reddit that the issue is also affecting them. The new owners are still working to stabilize the service.

It would make sense that the company is experiencing a widespread outage, given the massive winter storm that barreled across much of the US over the weekend. We asked the Joint Venture if the storm and service outage were related multiple times, but a spokesperson didn&#39;t answer the question.

Some TikTok users noted the outage coincided with the federal agents&#39; fatal shooting of a second American citizen in Minneapolis - this time Alex Pretti - and speculated that it was an attempt to restrict the flow of information about the incident. A TikTok USDS Joint Venture spokesperson told us that TikTok content guidelines haven&#39;t changed since the majority American-owned joint venture was established. ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Anthropic&#39;s Claude can now present the interfaces of other applications within its chat window, thanks to an extension of the Model Context Protocol (MCP).

Claude has long been able to fetch data from third-party applications through an MCP server connection. That capability has been expanded to present user interface elements like charts, forms, and dashboards, allowing third-party apps to be operated from within the chat window.

&quot;Claude already connects to your tools and takes actions on your behalf,&quot; the company said in a blog post. &quot;Now those tools show up right in the conversation, so you can see what&#39;s happening and collaborate in real time.&quot;

The change makes Claude&#39;s chat environment more like a cross-application interface layer – users no longer have to switch application focus to access app-specific tools. It could pose a challenge to operating system makers like Apple, Google, and Microsoft, similar to the one presented by web browsers – it reduces the need to interact with the operating system.

And it&#39;s not just Claude that stands to benefit. The extension, called MCP Apps, should be available in other vendors&#39; AI applications, including Goose, Visual Studio Code, and ChatGPT, either today or soon.

The MCP Apps Extension (SEP-1865) was first proposed back in November 2025 and is based on MCP-UI and the OpenAI Apps SDK. It allows MCP servers to deliver interactive user interface elements that hosts can render in-conversation, rather than returning data alone.

&quot;MCP Apps address a real gap between what agentic tools can provide and how users naturally want to interact with them,&quot; said Clare Liguori, senior principal engineer at AWS, in remarks accompanying the MCP blog post. &quot;The ability to render dynamic interfaces directly in conversation makes it easier to leverage MCP server capabilities in practical ways.&quot;

Initially, this ability to be proxied within Claude is limited to Anthropic&#39;s launch partners: Amplitude, Asana, Box, Canva, Clay, Figma, Hex, monday.com, Slack, and (soon) Salesforce. But expect that to expand over time as other software makers adapt their apps.

MCP Apps surface third-party interface elements in iframes, but with additional capabilities like logging events for debugging, opening links in the user&#39;s browser, sending follow-up messages, and updating the underlying model&#39;s context.

&quot;Running UI from MCP servers means running code you didn&#39;t write within your MCP host,&quot; the MCP post explains, citing various security layers like iframe sandboxing, pre-declared templates for prevailing HTML content prior to rendering, auditable messages, and host-managed approvals for UI-initiated tool calls.

Whether those defenses prove sufficient to avoid creating novel risks will be tested in time. ®

            <div id="article-text">More than 400 tech workers have urged their CEOs to &quot;call the White House and demand ICE leave our cities&quot; after masked federal agents shot and killed Alex Pretti over the weekend and the world&#39;s richest and most powerful chief executives remained silent.

In October, when President Trump threatened to send federal law enforcement to San Francisco, tech leaders reportedly called the White House and Trump reversed course, telling reporters that phone calls from Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang and Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff had changed his mind.

Meanwhile, US Immigration and Customs Enforcement and National Guard troops were deployed to other cities, including Portland, Los Angeles, Chicago, and Minneapolis, where federal agents have now shot and killed two people, Pretti and Renee Good, this month.

The tech industry&#39;s C-suite has yet to publicly speak out against these recent fatal shootings involving federal agents - or the larger dismantling of democracy and the international order under the Trump administration - but their employees are, with hundreds of workers from Amazon, Apple, Google, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia, Salesforce, and many, many other companies demanding ICE leave American cities.

&quot;This cannot continue, and we know the tech industry can make a difference,&quot; according to the ICEout tech petition that calls on CEOs to do three things:

As of mid-Monday, about 450 tech employees had signed the letter.

The Register contacted 16 companies (Amazon, Apple, Cisco, Cloudflare, Google, IBM, Lyft, Intel, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia, Okta, OpenAI, PayPal, Salesforce, and Stripe) whose employees signed their support for the ICEout efforts and asked if their CEOs planned to take any of the above actions.

None of them immediately responded to our inquiries.

On Sunday, more than 60 CEOs of large Minnesota-based companies, including 3M, Best Buy, General Mills, Target, and UnitedHealth, signed an open letter &quot;calling for an immediate deescalation of tensions and for state, local and federal officials to work together to find real solutions.&quot; ®

Don&#39;t let that fool you into thinking AI is taking over work, though: frequent AI users are still a tiny minority of overall workers.

Sharp increases in the workplace usage of AI throughout the year almost entirely leveled off between Q3 and Q4 2025, Gallup reported over the weekend. The total percentage of workers using AI climbed just a single percentage point in the final three months of the year, from 45 percent in Q3 to 46 percent. Similarly, respondents noting that their company had adopted AI hovered at 38 percent in Q4 – just a single percentage point higher than Q3 adoption numbers.

That said, while AI adoption and usage were flat over the final quarter of 2025, the number of workers reporting frequent and daily usage of AI did increase.

There was a three percent increase in frequent AI usage, defined as being a few times a week, and a two percent increase in daily AI usage. While greater than the overall one percent increase, those changes are still small, and it&#39;s also worth noting they comprise a vast minority of AI users overall. Per the responses, only 26 percent of workers are using AI frequently, and just 12 percent are using it daily.

So who&#39;s jumping aboard? The results there aren&#39;t surprising either.

Per Gallup, knowledge-based industries are dominating in AI usage, with the tech sector particularly fond of it – 77 percent of tech professionals report using AI in the workplace, with 57 percent doing so frequently and 31 percent using AI daily. University workers and finance professionals are also high adopters.

Interestingly enough, workers in &quot;remote-capable&quot; roles, which Gallup defines as jobs that &quot;could reasonably be completed remotely regardless of where the employee actually works,&quot; are big fans of AI, with 66 percent of them reporting using it in Q4. Far fewer employees in non-remote capable positions report using AI – just 32 percent – though that could be the nature of their jobs, as Gallup notes remote positions tend to be desk and office-based, while on-site jobs often involve more physical work.

Leadership positions, which Gallup defines separately from managers and individual contributors and which tend to be desk- and office-based roles, are also more likely to use AI than other workers, the pollster said, while noting the gap between leadership and rest-of-the-workplace AI usage has widened in recent years.

Taken as a whole, Gallup argues that the growing divide between users and non-users, and stagnating expansion, means that AI has a use-case problem.

&quot;Gallup research shows that lack of utility is the most common barrier to individual AI use, suggesting that clear AI use cases may be more apparent for leaders than employees in other roles,&quot; the polling agency concluded of its Q4 numbers.

&quot;This underscores the importance of grounding decisions about AI adoption in a clear understanding of how AI may be applied to different roles and functions, not just among those closest to decision-making,&quot; Gallup added.

In other words, the C-suite ought to start thinking outside its own experience on AI adoption, because the average employee doesn&#39;t seem to find it particularly useful. That, or they&#39;re realizing AI isn&#39;t saving them any time, and may even be eating up more of it. ®

For those of us who don’t ever seem to know where our keys or wallets have gone.

Some people rarely lose things. Wallets are always exactly where they’re supposed to be, keys never go missing, and remotes never slip between the couch cushions. And then there’s the rest of us — the folks who can’t ever seem to find the thing that was right there a few seconds ago. For us, there are Bluetooth trackers.

Bluetooth trackers have been around for a long time, and they all generally work the same way. You stick the tracker onto an object, pair it with your phone, and then, when you lose said object, you can go into an app and ring the tracker. But these days, Bluetooth trackers can do a lot more. Some have ultra-wideband chips that enable precision tracking, so you can find exactly where in a room your item is. Increasingly, trackers also tap into large networks — like Apple’s and Google’s — making it easier to locate lost items outside the home. Many will notify you if they detect you’ve left the device behind or come with QR codes that link to your contact information so people can easily return lost devices.

Bluetooth trackers are meant to find lost items. To test that, we lose items — both organically (some of us really do misplace wallets and keys daily) and in more controlled test environments. For the latter, one example is testing how these trackers perform in office environments or in multi-story houses. Sometimes, we also enlist the help of family and friends to “hide” objects to evaluate precision finding features. We’ll also enlist help to simulate and evaluate unwanted tracking alerts. In our testing, we’re also looking to assess factors like Bluetooth and network (ie., Find My, Tile, etc.) range, battery life, and how loud chimes / alerts are.

Are you limited to Bluetooth range, or can you make use of wider networks like Apple’s Find My, Google’s Find Hub network, or Amazon Sidewalk? Is it hard to hear the tracker when you ring it?

A technology that lets you track small objects can be abused to track people without their consent. Tracker companies know this, and an increasing number now come with anti-stalking features. These features may never prevent abuse 100 percent of the time, but we investigate whether these features were crafted with care, how well the company educates users about them, and if the company is proactive about updating them according to feedback from experts.

Do you need to pay a subscription fee to get all available features? If so, is it worth the moolah?

Most Bluetooth trackers last at least a year, but not all of them allow you to replace the battery. That means you have to buy a whole new tracker when the battery dies. I prefer the ability to replace batteries whenever possible.

These features are incredibly handy but also have the potential for misuse. Take AirTags. When Apple launched the trackers, it hadn’t anticipated they’d be used to track people or stolen items — but that’s exactly what happened. It’s since beefed up its anti-stalking features, and companies like Tile have also followed suit. Apple and Google have launched a standard that enables unwanted tracking alerts across both Android and iOS devices — and major players like Tile, Samsung, and Chipolo are on board. But until this standard is up and running, it pays to be aware of each tracker’s current approach when you’re deciding the best option for you.

As a consummate Loser of Things, I’ve tested my fair share of Bluetooth trackers on wallets, keys, and luggage. Here’s what I’d recommend if you, too, have a hard time finding things.

Apple’s AirTags can help you find your lost items with their ultra wideband technology. You’ll get the best compatibility with an iPhone, though Apple released an Android app that can detect an AirTag’s location and notify you if one seems to be following you.

When Apple launched AirTags in 2021, it really did shake up the category. That’s because AirTags are equipped with Apple’s Ultra Wideband (UWB) chip and tap into Apple’s vast Find My network. That’s a potent combo. And even though you can now get third-party accessories that work with the Find My network — including the Pebblebee trackers featured later in this guide — AirTags are still the best, thanks to UWB.

Basically, UWB enables precision tracking while Find My compatibility expands range far, far beyond Bluetooth’s limitations. With precision tracking, all you have to do is open the Find My app, tap “Find,” and you should see an arrow pointing you in the exact direction you need to go to find your item. Using the Find My network also means that so long as there’s an Apple device nearby, a lost AirTag can ping its location to Apple’s iCloud servers without notifying the owners of those other devices. And there are over a billion Apple products out there.

That accuracy is super convenient. My keys fell out of my pocket while running once, and I didn’t notice until my phone pinged me to say my keys were no longer with me. While I wasn’t able to use the precision tracking outdoors, I could see the last reported location in the Find My app. Twenty minutes had already passed, but I was still able to find my keys. I haven’t had that degree of success with any other item tracker.

However, this accuracy is a double-edged sword. In 2022, I ran a test to see whether I could track a friend and my spouse (with their consent) in real time. And I could, to a disturbing degree. While Apple’s unwanted tracking prevention measures worked, there were also inherent flaws. (You can read about our testing in full here.) However, Apple has since improved unwanted tracking alerts by shortening the time before you’re notified an unknown AirTag is in your vicinity, making chimes louder, and creating a separate app that lets Android users scan for unknown AirTags. Apple also now informs users during setup that unwanted tracking is a crime and that AirTags are “intended solely to track items that belong to you.”

Apple has also added more ways to share AirTag locations with trusted people. iOS 17 introduced AirTag sharing, which means shared items won’t trigger unwanted tracking alerts. As of iOS 18.2, you can also share the location of a lost AirTag with other people via a temporary link. So if an airline loses your luggage, you can send them a link to an interactive map showing your item’s last known location. (Apple is partnering with more than 15 airlines for this particular use case.)

The only thing I really don’t like about AirTags is that they aren’t truly $29. They’re $29, plus the cost of any accessory needed to attach them to the item you want to track. For example, you’ll need a holder to attach it to your keys or luggage. Thankfully, there’s a robust third-party accessory market, so you don’t have to pay Apple’s prices if you don’t want to. The fact that you can easily replace the battery with a regular CR2032 coin cell battery helps take the sting out, too. I’ve done it for two of my AirTags, and it’s much, much cheaper than buying two new ones.

All that being said, it’s worth noting that Apple just announced a new AirTag that costs $29 and still lacks a lanyard hole, meaning you’ll still need an accessory to attach it to anything. We’ll be testing it soon, but the key updates include a second-gen UWB chip for improved Precision Finding, helping you locate items from “50 percent farther away” using haptic, visual, and audio signals. It also features an upgraded Bluetooth chip that further expands its tracking range, along with an updated speaker that’s supposedly twice as loud.

The Tile Pro is the company’s loudest Bluetooth tracker and has the widest range at 400 feet. It also has a user-replaceable battery, unlike other Tiles.

More and more trackers now support both Google’s and Apple’s Find My networks, but Tile’s trackers — especially the $34.99 Tile Pro — are still our top recommendation for Android users or mixed iOS / Android households. Functionally, the platform-agnostic trackers can do just about anything an AirTag can. Like AirTags, Tile devices can tap into a larger network — in this case, the Tile Network and Amazon Sidewalk — to help you find your devices outside of your phone’s Bluetooth range. While this network isn’t as expansive as Apple’s or Google’s, Amazon Sidewalk’s coverage has improved significantly. When we tested Google’s Find Hub-compatible trackers — including the Chipolo Pop, Pebblebee Clip 5, and the Moto Tag — we found that Tile still did better at tracking items outside the home.

Unfortunately, Tile still can’t do true real-time tracking, and it still doesn’t offer a tracker with UWB, so it lacks the AirTag’s precision tracking. The company announced one back in 2021, but we’re still waiting, partly because Apple is effectively blocking UWB compatibility for third parties in iOS and because Tile’s priorities shifted once it was acquired by Life360.

In 2024, Google finally launched its Find My Device network, which was later renamed Find Hub. It works similarly to Apple’s Find My network: you’ll be able to share trackers with family members, and there are also unwanted tracking alerts.

Initially, the network lagged behind Apple’s, but it’s starting to catch up. After several weeks of testing Find Hub-compatible trackers — specifically the Chipolo Pop, Pebblebee Clip 5, and Moto Tag — in April, we found the network had improved significantly over the past year or so, especially in busy areas. Still, it’s clear Google prioritized privacy over precision.

Google is making some progress, though. In May, Google added UWB support for more precise tracking with Motorola’s Moto Tag and, eventually, other compatible phones and trackers. Google also rolled out satellite connectivity to Pixel 9 phones and newer devices in August, with the ability to share tracker locations with airline staff coming soon.

That said, Life360’s acquisition has brought some meaningful upgrades. Pressing a Tile button three times now sends an SOS alert to emergency contacts through Life360. You can also add others to your Circle so they can view and ring nearby Tiles on a shared Life360 map. More recently, Tile trackers have become fully integrated into Life360, letting users manage their trackers directly within the Life360 app. This merger unlocked a few premium features for free, including push alerts for forgotten items and two-day location history.

Still, most of the good stuff — like 30-day location history, unlimited sharing with friends and family, free replacements for damaged Tiles, and up to $100 reimbursement for lost items — sits behind a $29.99/year subscription. Fortunately, Tile offers new members a one-year trial, and a single subscription covers all your devices. You also still get a lot of core functionality without paying: you can find your Tile via Bluetooth, view its last known location on a map, ring your phone from the Tile, and share access with one other person for free.

Tile also stands out for its versatility. While AirTags come in a single puck-like design, Tile offers four distinct form factors to suit different needs. The card-shaped Tile Slim ($29.99), for example, is the best option if you’re constantly losing your wallet. The square Tile Mate ($24.99) comes with a hole so you can stick it on a key ring or carabiner, and is probably the most versatile. The $24.99 Tile Sticker, meanwhile, is a small disc that comes with a sticky backing so you can put it on remotes, pet collars, and anything else you can stick it on.

The best Tile will depend on what you’re looking to track. My personal favorite, however, is the $34.99 Tile Pro, which is shaped like a key fob, is larger than the Mate, and can also be attached to other items. Of the four, it has the longest Bluetooth range at 500 feet and the loudest ring. It’s also the only one that has a replaceable one-year CR2032 battery.

Last but not least, Tile may actually be better than AirTags for tracking stolen items. The company rolled out an anti-theft feature in 2023, which renders Tile devices invisible to unwanted tracking detection in the event someone steals your item. Just know that to use it, Tile requires you to submit a government ID for verification, agree to Tile working with law enforcement without a subpoena, and consent to a $1 million fine if you misuse this feature. For anti-stalking measures, Tile also has a “Scan and Secure” feature, which allows you to use the Tile app to scan for unknown Tile devices in your vicinity. While better than nothing, it’s a flawed measure, as it requires the potential victim to proactively scan their surroundings.

The Pebblebee Clip 5 supports Apple’s Find My and Google’s Find Hub networks, but also has a 500-foot Bluetooth range, LEDs that flash to help you locate it, and a rechargeable battery that lasts up to 12 months on a single charge.

If you’re looking for an AirTag or Tile alternative, the $34.99 Pebblebee Clip 5 is an excellent choice. It’s one of a growing number of trackers that support both Apple’s Find My and Google’s Find Hub networks, which is a major improvement over its predecessor. Setup is seamless for iOS and Android users, but because Pebblebee’s app doesn’t handle tracking, features like geofencing and safe locations depend on which network you choose. Apple’s Find My, for instance, supports “left behind” alerts and safe locations; Google’s Find Hub still lacks an equivalent.

The thing I like best about the Pebblebee Clip 5 is its rechargeable battery. It can last up to a year on a single charge, though you may get longer than that depending on your usage. It features a USB-C port, and Pebblebee advertises a Bluetooth range of up to 500 feet, which is 100 feet more than the Tile Pro, our pick for Android users. Additionally, the Clip 5 features a blinking LED strip that’s noticeably brighter than prior models and a significantly louder ringtone, making lost items easier to find, even in dark or noisy environments.

You can still use Pebblebee’s app to set voice tags, ask Amazon Alexa or Google Assistant for help, or double-tap the tracker to ring your phone. While the Clip 5 is larger than an AirTag, it also includes a snap-on key ring, so you don’t need to pay for an extra accessory just to attach it to your belongings. It’s also rated IP66 for dust and water resistance, making it slightly more durable than earlier Pebblebee trackers. ~ Sheena Vasani, Commerce Writer

The Pebblebee Card 5 has a rechargeable battery that lasts up to 18 months and supports wireless charging. It works with Apple’s Find My and Google’s Find Hub, but you can also use the Pebblebee app for voice tagging.

You could try stuffing an AirTag into a bifold wallet and hope it stays put — or opt for a Find My–compatible alternative that’s actually designed for wallets, like the $34.99 Pebblebee Card 5. It plays nicely with both Apple’s Find My and Google’s Find Hub networks, giving you cross-platform flexibility and the benefits of each, all with a super loud ringtone. It doesn’t offer precision tracking because it lacks UWB, but it makes up for it with said ringtones. It also supports unwanted tracking alerts as part of the Find My network.

The Card 5 stands out for its sleek design and wireless charging. At just 1.8mm thick, it’s one of the thinnest trackers you can buy and measures about the size of a credit card, meaning you can easily slip it into an overstuffed wallet packed to the brim with receipts, gift cards, and cash. The same can’t always be said of Tile’s wallet tracker, which is nearly twice as thick. What’s more, the Card 5 lasts up to 18 months on a single charge and supports wireless charging, so you don’t have to worry about replacing any batteries.

Unsurprisingly, the Card 5 shares many of the same strengths as the Pebblebee Clip 5, including support for the Pebblebee app and voice tagging. You also get a range of up to 500 feet, an IP66 rating for dust and water resistance, and a built-in button you can press to help locate your phone. ~ Sheena Vasani, Commerce Writer

The $29 Chipolo Pop offers a similar form factor to Apple’s AirTag in a lighter, more colorful package with a hole for a keychain or lanyard, a louder beep, and compatibility with both Apple’s Find My and Google’s Find Hub networks (though only one at a time). You can even use the Pop as a remote camera shutter and press the built-in button twice to find your lost phone. Unlike Chipolo’s other trackers, it boasts a wider 300-foot Bluetooth range, a more robust IP55 rating for water and dust resistance, and includes a user-replaceable battery that can last up to a year.

In my testing, tracking was accurate on both Apple’s and Google’s networks in most cases, Google’s struggled to track items outside my home as reliably as the Tile. And without UWB, the Pop couldn’t match the AirTag’s pinpoint precision. Still, the Chipolo app provides Android users with reliable out-of-range alerts and left-behind notifications — something Pebblebee and Moto Tag’s trackers lack —which, in my experience, triggered even faster than the AirTag and Tile.

If you’re willing to spend an extra $10, the $39 Chipolo Loop is very similar to the Chipolo Pop, with many of the same strengths and weaknesses. However, it charges via USB-C and includes a built-in silicone ring that’s easy to attach to keys, bags, and other items. You also get a more durable IP67 rating and an extra 100 feet of Bluetooth range — up to 400 feet total. Just note you’ll have to supply your own USB-C cable. ~ Sheena Vasani, Commerce Writer

If you’re a Samsung Galaxy phone user, the $29.99 Samsung SmartTag2 gets you UWB tracking and can tap into the Galaxy Find network, which operates similarly to Apple’s Find My network. It’s a great AirTag alternative but isn’t our overall pick for Android because it’s limited to Samsung Galaxy users. But for Samsung users, the latest SmartTag2 includes an improved Compass View, longer battery life, and a better app experience. It also has a newer, oblong design with a larger key ring than the original SmartTag.

Motorola’s $29.99 Moto Tag is the first tracker on Google’s Find Hub network to offer ultra wideband for locating lost items on phones equipped with a UWB chip, which is a feature Google only recently enabled via a firmware update. Like Apple’s AirTag, it can guide you directly to your missing item via directional cues in the Find Hub app. It worked well in my testing, helping me find the exact location of nearby items in my small apartment, though Apple’s AirTag was occasionally more precise when tracking objects farther away or through walls. The Moto Tag was also less effective than Tile’s trackers at locating items outside my home.

Still, if you want a tracker to find things around the house, the Moto Tag is a solid pick. It also fits most AirTag accessories, carries an IP67 rating for dust and water resistance, and uses a replaceable CR2032 battery that lasts up to a year. It can ring your misplaced phone, too, and doubles as a remote shutter for Motorola phones. ~ Sheena Vasani, Commerce Writer

The rechargeable Chipolo Card is also a good tracker for wallets. Priced at $39, it works with either Apple’s Find My or Google’s Find Hub network and carries an IP67 rating for dust and water resistance. It supports Qi wireless charging, unlike the Chipolo Loop, and features a slim design that slips neatly into your wallet. It also offers a 400-foot Bluetooth range — a bit less than the Pebblebee Card 5 — and lasts about six months per charge. Overall, it’s a solid choice if you want something simple, even if it lacks the QR code found on some competing trackers. ~ Sheena Vasani, Commerce Writer

Eufy’s rechargeable $34.99 SmartTrack Card E30 is another good option for wallets, one that offers the same Find My network benefits as the aforementioned Pebblebee Card 5. On the back, there’s also a QR code — similar to the ones Tile uses — that helps good Samaritans return your item to you. Like the Pebblebee’s newest offerings, you can share it with multiple people if you set it up via the Eufy Security app. The bummer here is that it doesn’t work with Android and lacks UWB.

Update, January 26th: Adjusted pricing / availability and added the Pebblebee Clip 5, Pebblebee Card 5, and Chipolo Card to our list of recommendations. We also mentioned Apple’s latest AirTag and removed a pair of former Chipolo picks.

            <div id="article-text">Greg Brockman said he started “getting involved politically” in 2025.

Greg Brockman said he started “getting involved politically” in 2025.

OpenAI’s co-founder and longtime president, Greg Brockman, didn’t just make a run-of-the-mill donation to the main pro-Trump super PAC — together, he and his wife Anna’s September 2025 donations equaled the largest of them all, totaling $25 million to “MAGA Inc.,” per a recent filing. The Brockmans’ donations made up nearly one-fourth of the six-month fundraising cycle.

It’s the latest in a string of examples of tech executives cozying up to President Trump’s administration, happening as the administration pushes to aggressively back the AI industry and defang state-level regulations that companies like OpenAI have largely opposed. OpenAI did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Brockman’s multimillion-dollar donation isn’t the only example of him spending big, under his own name, on lobbying efforts that have their sights set on dismantling potential AI industry regulation. The pro-AI super PAC “Leading the Future,” of which Brockman is a significant backer, has bought ads targeting New York State Assemblymember Alex Bores — a cosponsor of New York’s RAISE Act, which was watered down at the last minute after coordinated lobbying efforts.

Though news of the Brockmans’ donations first broke earlier this month, it’s seen a resurgence in online discussion after the recent death of Alex Pretti in Minneapolis, where federal officers have fatally shot two people during an anti-immigrant crackdown. Tech workers from across the industry, including multiple employees at OpenAI, have signed a letter calling for their CEOs to cancel all contracts with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and publicly condemn the department’s actions. “When Trump threatened to send the national guard to San Francisco in October, tech industry leaders called the White House,” the petition’s website states. “It worked: Trump backed down. Today we’re calling on our CEOs to pick up the phone again.”

However, since Trump’s inauguration, tech leader after tech leader has donated to his inauguration fund, flocked to Mar-a-Lago to meet with him, or attended White House dinners by his side. In return, they’ve gotten an administration eager to roll back consumer protections and tech regulation. Trump’s AI Action Plan resurrected a failed Republican attempt to bar states from passing AI regulations, to tech leaders’ delight. The new provision states that “AI is far too important to smother in bureaucracy at this early stage” and that the government “should not allow AI-related Federal funding to be directed toward states with burdensome AI regulations that waste these funds,” though it should also “not interfere with states’ rights to pass prudent laws that are not unduly restrictive to innovation.” Targets of the moratorium include SB 53, the landmark AI transparency bill California Gov. Gavin Newsom signed in September despite many tech companies lobbying against it, including OpenAI.

In 2019, Brockman co-wrote a blog post about how hard it is to “change powerful systems … once they’ve been deployed,” and that it’s “important to address AGI’s safety and policy risks before it is created.” Six years later, his posts have shifted in tone, highlighting the importance of “approach[ing] emerging technology with a growth-focused mindset.” In a New Year’s Eve post on X, Brockman wrote that “this year, my wife Anna and I started getting involved politically, including through political contributions, reflecting support for policies that advance American innovation and constructive dialogue between government and the technology sector.” He added that “it’s been great to see the president’s and his administration’s willingness to engage directly with the AI community.”

            <p><strong>The Verge | 2026-01-26</strong></p>

            <div id="article-text">The class-action was spurred by a 2019 report about human contractors listening to recordings made when devices like Pixel phones or Google Home speakers were triggered inadvertently.

The class-action was spurred by a 2019 report about human contractors listening to recordings made when devices like Pixel phones or Google Home speakers were triggered inadvertently.

Google could owe you some money, now that it’s moving to settle a class-action lawsuit over how it handled recordings captured when its devices were activated by something other than Google Assistant’s actual trigger word, “Ok Google.” German outlet VRT NWS’s 2019 report exposed the issue, and court filings from last Friday say the proposed settlement number is $68 million, as reported previously by Reuters.

The lawsuit accuses Google of “unlawful and intentional recording of individuals’ confidential communications without their consent,” during these “False Accepts.” VRT NWS reported that human workers who analyzed Assistant audio clips recalled hearing personal information and private conversations in instances where Google Assistant was triggered inadvertently or by someone who wasn’t supposed to be using it, like children.

The plaintiffs’ accusations had also included a claim that “information gleaned from these recordings was wrongly transmitted to third parties for targeted advertising and for other purposes,” which Google denied, and in the proposed settlement, it denies any allegations of wrongdoing.

Google, Apple, and Amazon all faced accusations of inadvertent recordings tied to trigger words for their AI helpers being shared for review by human contractors in 2019. Apple settled a similar class-action lawsuit in January 2025 for $95 million, and continued to refute rumors it used recordings to target ads. These days, Siri is in line for a generative AI upgrade, Alexa’s is rolling out, and Assistant is slowly being shoved aside in favor of Gemini.

If the settlement is approved, it will be paid out to people whose Google accounts were associated with at least one device with Google Assistant pre-installed as early as 2016, including Pixel phones, Google Home devices, Google smart speakers and smart displays, Nest Hub, and Nest Hub Max. Customers who purchased one of these devices will be eligible for a recovery payout of $18 to $56. Anyone who used Google Assistant or lived in a household with an Assistant device that illegally recorded their conversations will also be eligible for a payout of $2 to $10.

If you prefer over-ear headphones to earbuds and own an iPhone or another Apple device, the AirPods Max with USB-C are worth a look, especially now that you can buy them at Best Buy as part of a flash deal for $429.99 ($120 off) through tomorrow, January 27th. That’s $30 shy of their lowest price to date, and a notable deal given these over-ears don’t often drop below $449.99 outside of big sales events.

The AirPods Max stand out thanks to their premium design, which uses premium materials like aluminum, steel, and fabric that feel more high-end than plastic rivals from Sony and Bose. They’re also one of the few pairs of over-ear headphones designed to work seamlessly with Apple gadgets, thanks to features like automatic device switching and hands-free Siri access. Additionally, they can tap into Apple’s Find My network and the company’s nifty audio sharing feature, which lets two pairs of AirPods or Beats headphones listen from a single iPhone or iPad.

In terms of audio, the AirPods Max deliver well-balanced, natural sound with support for 24-bit / 48kHz lossless audio playback over USB-C, so you can listen to compatible songs with better detail and clarity. They also continue to deliver top-tier noise cancellation, support ultra-low latency audio, and feature a clear transparency mode, making them a great all-around option for Apple users.

            <div id="article-text">﻿After immigration agents killed a second person in Minneapolis, anti-ICE sentiment has reached every corner of the internet — including adult subreddits.

﻿After immigration agents killed a second person in Minneapolis, anti-ICE sentiment has reached every corner of the internet — including adult subreddits.

“Fuck ICE first, second, third, and fourth. Then worry about fucking me,” a Reddit post reads. “Immigrants of any status are my friends, neighbors, and colleagues.”

Across the internet — and in the streets — the sentiment is unavoidable, especially after a federal immigration agent shot and killed Alex Pretti, a 37-year-old nurse, in Minneapolis on Saturday. The killing came just weeks after an immigration agent shot and killed another person, Renee Good, who federal officials smeared as a “domestic terrorist” with no evidence. This Reddit post’s message would fit right in in online spaces for countless hobbies, interests, and creators: anti-ICE discussions are happening everywhere from r/Military to cat subreddits. Except this time, it was posted to an adult forum.

r/MassiveCock is a subreddit that is primarily photos of users’ penises. Prior to this weekend, the forum was largely apolitical: a place for users to sext or promote their OnlyFans accounts. Over the weekend, peppered between the usual dick pics, some posts began to take an explicitly anti-ICE stance.

“How hard I get when I think about abolishing ICE,” one post reads, accompanied by a photo to demonstrate. “Sorry, I was just thinking about ICE agents rotting behind bars for the rest of their lives,” says another post with a photo.

A user who goes by tomatoe1987 posted one of the “Fuck ICE” messages in the subreddit that became one of the top submissions over the weekend. The user, who requested anonymity because he’s a private person, says he’s active in adult subreddits that he primarily uses to meet people and to show off. He told The Verge that he’s moderately politically active — always votes, has attended a few rallies — but doesn’t consider himself an activist of any kind. His Reddit account is his main platform, and he says he has zero social media in his personal life outside of it.

“ICE events have been having a devastating effect on my community, friends, and colleagues.”

“I admit I find what I did to be a little (very) silly,” he said in a message to The Verge. “There’s certainly a large element of what I did that was just to vent frustration in the only public way I could. ICE events have been having a devastating effect on my community, friends, and colleagues.”

There are several dozen “Fuck ICE” or similar posts in the subreddit as of Monday, some with hundreds of comments.

Many of the comments under tomatoe1987’s post were supportive of his anti-ICE statement, but there were, of course, complaints along the lines of “Why bring politics into sex?”

“Someone else said to me that nothing in life should feel ‘normal’ when these sorts of things are happening in our country. Even porn and sex,” he said. “All of it should make supporters of unchecked political violence and fascism uncomfortable.” He also said it was a way to reject the assumption that because he posts on “dominant, physically imposing styled subreddits” that he has certain political leanings or lacks empathy.

“I hope at least a few people that pay attention to me see that you can be ‘manly’ and still have compassion for fellow human beings,” tomatoe1987 said.

Politics and sex have always been deeply intertwined, of course, and adult content online is increasingly under attack, including via age verification laws that critics say are ineffective at keeping adult content away from minors, but that have a chilling effect on free speech and raise privacy concerns. In the UK, Reddit requires users to verify their age by uploading a selfie or a photo of their ID before they access some mature content, though users have figured out ways to bypass the verification process.

ICE has become a topic of conversation in other adult subreddits. A moderator of r/RandomActsofBlowJob (exactly what it sounds like) posted on Sunday that “Fuck ICE” was the subreddit’s “stance on what’s going on regarding immigration enforcement.” (A related subreddit also had the same stance.) There’s also been debate over the ethics of continuing to run a fascist kink subreddit in an age of violent state repression.

tomatoe1987 says he has no idea if anti-ICE content will stick in r/MassiveCock. For now it’s simply “a little bit of day to day hope,” he says. “Just letting people know that there’s a lot of people out there who are concerned about their safety and well-being.”

            <div id="article-text">The platform is using AI to repurpose old films for mobile, but its first effort is an awkward fit for the format.﻿

The platform is using AI to repurpose old films for mobile, but its first effort is an awkward fit for the format.﻿

Most vertical video microdrama apps have been focused on putting out newly produced series meant to be watched on your phone. But Tattle TV thinks that people might also be interested in checking out bite-size pieces of cinematic history.

Though Tattle TV — a UK-based streaming platform created by filmmakers Philip McGoldrick and Marina Elderton — features a reality dating series about dog owners and a modern drama about a female MMA fighter, the company’s latest debut is a vertically oriented edit of Alfred Hitchcock’s silent film The Lodger: A Story of the London Fog.

Similar to other microdrama apps, Tattle TV splits all of its content into short segments that can be purchased individually using an in-app currency (Tattle Coins) that you buy using actual money. The platform also offers monthly and yearly subscriptions for $3.99 and $29.99, respectively, and Reward Coins — which are essentially the same as regular Tattle Coins — can be obtained by “engaging with fun activities” like watching advertisements.

Tattle TV’s content library is relatively scant right now, and its vertical spin on The Lodger is only available in the US (where the film is part of the public domain) due to licensing restrictions. But in a recent interview with Deadline, Elderton said that the company has plans to flesh out its catalog by obtaining the rights to other British classics like Monty Python and The Crystal Maze.

“Repurposing recognizable shows would be such an interesting introduction to what a vertical is,” Elderton explained. “There is a huge proportion of the British population who don’t know what verticals are and if we can access those audiences as well as verticals fans then that is a bit of a goldmine.”

Watching The Lodger on Tattle TV is a rather odd experience because there are many elements of the movie, like its original aspect ratio, that simply weren’t designed for the vertical format. While you can still get the gist of the story thanks to intertitle cards, many actors are essentially cropped out of the film in order to keep your focus on main characters Daisy Bunting (June Tripp) and Jonathan Drew / The Lodger (Ivor Novello). Tattle TV’s version of The Lodger is also scored with music that sounds more like the ominous stuff you hear in trailers for contemporary thrillers as opposed to the type of music silent films are typically accompanied by.

Tattle TV’s format and interstitial ads make it hard to get lost in The Lodger’s fantasy. But McGoldrick is confident that, because the company is “an early adopter of cutting-edge AI tools,” it’s in a prime position to quickly produce more vertical editions of classic movies and shows that people will be interested in watching. The company probably can crank out a few more of these things if it can secure the right permissions, but as they currently exist, it’s a little hard to imagine these verticals capturing people’s imaginations.

            <h2>Inside OpenAI’s big play for science</h2>
            <p><strong>MIT Technology Review | 2026-01-26</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2026/01/26/1131728/inside-openais-big-play-for-science/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">In the three years since ChatGPT’s explosive debut, OpenAI’s technology has upended a remarkable range of everyday activities at home, at work, in schools—anywhere people have a browser open or a phone out, which is everywhere.

Now OpenAI is making an explicit play for scientists. In October, the firm announced that it had launched a whole new team, called OpenAI for Science, dedicated to exploring how its large language models could help scientists and tweaking its tools to support them.

The last couple of months have seen a slew of social media posts and academic publications in which mathematicians, physicists, biologists, and others have described how LLMs (and OpenAI’s GPT-5 in particular) have helped them make a discovery or nudged them toward a solution they might otherwise have missed. In part, OpenAI for Science was set up to engage with this community.

And yet OpenAI is also late to the party. Google DeepMind, the rival firm behind groundbreaking scientific models such as AlphaFold and AlphaEvolve, has had an AI-for-science team for years. (When I spoke to Google DeepMind’s CEO and cofounder Demis Hassabis in 2023 about that team, he told me: “This is the reason I started DeepMind … In fact, it’s why I’ve worked my whole career in AI.”)

So why now? How does a push into science fit with OpenAI’s wider mission? And what exactly is the firm hoping to achieve?

I put these questions to Kevin Weil, a vice president at OpenAI who leads the new OpenAI for Science team, in an exclusive interview last week.

Weil is a product guy. He joined OpenAI a couple of years ago as chief product officer after being head of product at Twitter and Instagram. But he started out as a scientist. He got two-thirds of the way through a PhD in particle physics at Stanford University before ditching academia for the Silicon Valley dream. Weil is keen to highlight his pedigree: “I thought I was going to be a physics professor for the rest of my life,” he says. “I still read math books on vacation.”

Asked how OpenAI for Science fits with the firm’s existing lineup of white-collar productivity tools or the viral video app Sora, Weil recites the company mantra: “The mission of OpenAI is to try and build artificial general intelligence and, you know, make it beneficial for all of humanity.”

Just imagine the future impact this technology could have on science he says: New medicines, new materials, new devices. “Think about it helping us understand the nature of reality, helping us think through open problems. Maybe the biggest, most positive impact we’re going to see from AGI will actually be from its ability to accelerate science.”

He adds: “With GPT-5, we saw that becoming possible.”

As Weil tells it, LLMs are now good enough to be useful scientific collaborators. They can spitball ideas, suggest novel directions to explore, and find fruitful parallels between new problems and old solutions published in obscure journals decades ago or in foreign languages.

That wasn’t the case a year or so ago. Since it announced its first so-called reasoning model—a type of LLM that can break down problems into multiple steps and work through them one by one—in December 2024, OpenAI has been pushing the envelope of what the technology can do. Reasoning models have made LLMs far better at solving math and logic problems than they used to be. “You go back a few years and we were all collectively mind-blown that the models could get an 800 on the SAT,” says Weil.

But soon LLMs were acing math competitions and solving graduate-level physics problems. Last year, OpenAI and Google DeepMind both announced that their LLMs had achieved gold-medal-level performance in the International Math Olympiad, one of the toughest math contests in the world. “These models are no longer just better than 90% of grad students,” says Weil. “They’re really at the frontier of human abilities.”

That’s a huge claim, and it comes with caveats. Still, there’s no doubt that GPT-5, which includes a reasoning model,  is a big improvement on GPT-4 when it comes to complicated problem-solving. Measured against an industry benchmark known as GPQA, which includes more than 400 multiple-choice questions that test PhD-level knowledge in biology, physics, and chemistry, GPT-4 scores 39%, well below the human-expert baseline of around 70%. According to OpenAI, GPT-5.2 (the latest update to the model, released in December) scores 92%.

The excitement is evident—and perhaps excessive. In October, senior figures at OpenAI, including Weil, boasted on X that GPT-5 had found solutions to several unsolved math problems. Mathematicians were quick to point out that in fact what GPT-5 appeared to have done was dig up existing solutions in old research papers, including at least one written in German. That was still useful, but it wasn’t the achievement OpenAI seemed to have claimed. Weil and his colleagues deleted their posts.

Now Weil is more careful. It is often enough to find answers that exist but have been forgotten, he says: “We collectively stand on the shoulders of giants, and if LLMs can kind of accumulate that knowledge so that we don’t spend time struggling on a problem that is already solved, that’s an acceleration all of its own.”

He plays down the idea that LLMs are about to come up with a game-changing new discovery. “I don’t think models are there yet,” he says. “Maybe they’ll get there. I’m optimistic that they will.”

But, he insists, that’s not the mission: “Our mission is to accelerate science. And I don’t think the bar for the acceleration of science is, like, Einstein-level reimagining of an entire field.”

For Weil, the question is this: “Does science actually happen faster because scientists plus models can do much more, and do it more quickly, than scientists alone? I think we’re already seeing that.”

In November, OpenAI published a series of anecdotal case studies contributed by scientists, both inside and outside the company, that illustrated how they had used GPT-5 and how it had helped. “Most of the cases were scientists that were already using GPT-5 directly in their research and had come to us one way or another saying, ‘Look at what I’m able to do with these tools,’” says Weil.

The key things that GPT-5 seems to be good at are finding references and connections to existing work that scientists were not aware of, which sometimes sparks new ideas; helping scientists sketch mathematical proofs; and suggesting ways for scientists to test hypotheses in the lab.

“GPT 5.2 has read substantially every paper written in the last 30 years,” says Weil. “And it understands not just the field that a particular scientist is working in; it can bring together analogies from other, unrelated fields.”

“That’s incredibly powerful,” he continues. “You can always find a human collaborator in an adjacent field, but it’s difficult to find, you know, a thousand collaborators in all thousand adjacent fields that might matter. And in addition to that, I can work with the model late at night—it doesn’t sleep—and I can ask it 10 things in parallel, which is kind of awkward to do to a human.”

Most of the scientists OpenAI reached out to back up Weil’s position.

Robert Scherrer, a professor of physics and astronomy at Vanderbilt University, only played around with ChatGPT for fun (“I used to it rewrite the theme song for Gilligan’s Island in the style of Beowulf, which it did very well,” he tells me) until his Vanderbilt colleague Alex Lupsasca, a fellow physicist who now works at OpenAI, told him that GPT-5 had helped solve a problem he’d been working on.

Lupsasca gave Scherrer access to GPT-5 Pro, OpenAI’s $200-a-month premium subscription. “It managed to solve a problem that I and my graduate student could not solve despite working on it for several months,” says Scherrer.

It’s not perfect, he says: “GTP-5 still makes dumb mistakes. Of course, I do too, but the mistakes GPT-5 makes are even dumber.” And yet it keeps getting better, he says: “If current trends continue—and that’s a big if—I suspect that all scientists will be using LLMs soon.”

Derya Unutmaz, a professor of biology at the Jackson Laboratory, a nonprofit research institute, uses GPT-5 to brainstorm ideas, summarize papers, and plan experiments in his work studying the immune system. In the case study he shared with OpenAI, Unutmaz used GPT-5 to analyze an old data set that his team had previously looked at. The model came up with fresh insights and interpretations.

“LLMs are already essential for scientists,” he says. “When you can complete analysis of data sets that used to take months, not using them is not an option anymore.”

Nikita Zhivotovskiy, a statistician at the University of California, Berkeley, says he has been using LLMs in his research since the first version of ChatGPT came out.

Like Scherrer, he finds LLMs most useful when they highlight unexpected connections between his own work and existing results he did not know about. “I believe that LLMs are becoming an essential technical tool for scientists, much like computers and the internet did before,” he says. “I expect a long-term disadvantage for those who do not use them.”

But he does not expect LLMs to make novel discoveries anytime soon. “I have seen very few genuinely fresh ideas or arguments that would be worth a publication on their own,” he says. “So far, they seem to mainly combine existing results, sometimes incorrectly, rather than produce genuinely new approaches.”

I also contacted a handful of scientists who are not connected to OpenAI.

Andy Cooper, a professor of chemistry at the University of Liverpool and director of the Leverhulme Research Centre for Functional Materials Design, is less enthusiastic. “We have not found, yet, that LLMs are fundamentally changing the way that science is done,” he says. “But our recent results suggest that they do have a place.”

Cooper is leading a project to develop a so-called AI scientist that can fully automate parts of the scientific workflow. He says that his team doesn’t use LLMs to come up with ideas. But the tech is starting to prove useful as part of a wider automated system where an LLM can help direct robots, for example.

“My guess is that LLMs might stick more in robotic workflows, at least initially, because I’m not sure that people are ready to be told what to do by an LLM,” says Cooper. “I’m certainly not.”

LLMs may be becoming more and more useful, but caution is still key. In December, Jonathan Oppenheim, a scientist who works on quantum mechanics, called out a mistake that had made its way into a scientific journal. “OpenAI leadership are promoting a paper in Physics Letters B where GPT-5 proposed the main idea—possibly the first peer-reviewed paper where an LLM generated the core contribution,” Oppenheim posted on X. “One small problem: GPT-5’s idea tests the wrong thing.”

He continued: “GPT-5 was asked for a test that detects nonlinear theories. It provided a test that detects nonlocal ones. Related-sounding, but different. It’s like asking for a COVID test, and the LLM cheerfully hands you a test for chickenpox.”

It is clear that a lot of scientists are finding innovative and intuitive ways to engage with LLMs. It is also clear that the technology makes mistakes that can be so subtle even experts miss them.

Part of the problem is the way ChatGPT can flatter you into letting down your guard. As Oppenheim put it: “A core issue is that LLMs are being trained to validate the user, while science needs tools that challenge us.” In an extreme case, one individual (who was not a scientist) was persuaded by ChatGPT into thinking for months that he’d invented a new branch of mathematics.

Of course, Weil is well aware of the problem of hallucination. But he insists that newer models are hallucinating less and less. Even so, focusing on hallucination might be missing the point, he says.

“One of my teammates here, an ex math professor, said something that stuck with me,” says Weil. “He said: ‘When I’m doing research, if I’m bouncing ideas off a colleague, I’m wrong 90% of the time and that’s kind of the point. We’re both spitballing ideas and trying to find something that works.’”

“That’s actually a desirable place to be,” says Weil. “If you say enough wrong things and then somebody stumbles on a grain of truth and then the other person seizes on it and says, ‘Oh, yeah, that’s not quite right, but what if we—’ You gradually kind of find your trail through the woods.”

This is Weil’s core vision for OpenAI for Science. GPT-5 is good, but it is not an oracle. The value of this technology is in pointing people in new directions, not coming up with definitive answers, he says.

In fact, one of the things OpenAI is now looking at is making GPT-5 dial down its confidence when it delivers a response. Instead of saying Here’s the answer, it might tell scientists: Here’s something to consider.

“That’s actually something that we are spending a bunch of time on,” says Weil. “Trying to make sure that the model has some sort of epistemological humility.”

Another thing OpenAI is looking at is how to use GPT-5 to fact-check GPT-5. It’s often the case that if you feed one of GPT-5’s answers back into the model, it will pick it apart and highlight mistakes.

“You can kind of hook the model up as its own critic,” says Weil. “Then you can get a workflow where the model is thinking and then it goes to another model, and if that model finds things that it could improve, then it passes it back to the original model and says, ‘Hey, wait a minute—this part wasn’t right, but this part was interesting. Keep it.’ It’s almost like a couple of agents working together and you only see the output once it passes the critic.”

What Weil is describing also sounds a lot like what Google DeepMind did with AlphaEvolve, a tool that wrapped the firms LLM, Gemini, inside a wider system that filtered out the good responses from the bad and fed them back in again to be improved on. Google DeepMind has used AlphaEvolve to solve several real-world problems.

OpenAI faces stiff competition from rival firms, whose own LLMs can do most, if not all, of the things it claims for its own models. If that’s the case, why should scientists use GPT-5 instead of Gemini or Anthropic’s Claude, families of models that are themselves improving every year? Ultimately, OpenAI for Science may be as much an effort to plant a flag in new territory as anything else. The real innovations are still to come.

“I think 2026 will be for science what 2025 was for software engineering,” says Weil. “At the beginning of 2025, if you were using AI to write most of your code, you were an early adopter. Whereas 12 months later, if you’re not using AI to write most of your code, you’re probably falling behind. We’re now seeing those same early flashes for science as we did for code.”

He continues: “I think that in a year, if you’re a scientist and you’re not heavily using AI, you’ll be missing an opportunity to increase the quality and pace of your thinking.”

How do tech companies check if their users are kids?

This question has taken on new urgency recently thanks to growing concern about the dangers that can arise when children talk to AI chatbots. For years Big Tech asked for birthdays (that one could make up) to avoid violating child privacy laws, but they weren’t required to moderate content accordingly. Two developments over the last week show how quickly things are changing in the US and how this issue is becoming a new battleground, even among parents and child-safety advocates.

In one corner is the Republican Party, which has supported laws passed in several states that require sites with adult content to verify users’ ages. Critics say this provides cover to block anything deemed “harmful to minors,” which could include sex education. Other states, like California, are coming after AI companies with laws to protect kids who talk to chatbots (by requiring them to verify who’s a kid). Meanwhile, President Trump is attempting to keep AI regulation a national issue rather than allowing states to make their own rules. Support for various bills in Congress is constantly in flux.

So what might happen? The debate is quickly moving away from whether age verification is necessary and toward who will be responsible for it. This responsibility is a hot potato that no company wants to hold.

In a blog post last Tuesday, OpenAI revealed that it plans to roll out automatic age prediction. In short, the company will apply a model that uses factors like the time of day, among others, to predict whether a person chatting is under 18. For those identified as teens or children, ChatGPT will apply filters to “reduce exposure” to content like graphic violence or sexual role-play. YouTube launched something similar last year.

If you support age verification but are concerned about privacy, this might sound like a win. But there&#39;s a catch. The system is not perfect, of course, so it could classify a child as an adult or vice versa. People who are wrongly labeled under 18 can verify their identity by submitting a selfie or government ID to a company called Persona.

Selfie verifications have issues: They fail more often for people of color and those with certain disabilities. Sameer Hinduja, who co-directs the Cyberbullying Research Center, says the fact that Persona will need to hold millions of government IDs and masses of biometric data is another weak point. “When those get breached, we’ve exposed massive populations all at once,” he says.

Hinduja instead advocates for device-level verification, where a parent specifies a child’s age when setting up the child’s phone for the first time. This information is then kept on the device and shared securely with apps and websites.

That’s more or less what Tim Cook, the CEO of Apple, recently lobbied US lawmakers to call for. Cook was fighting lawmakers who wanted to require app stores to verify ages, which would saddle Apple with lots of liability.

More signals of where this is all headed will come on Wednesday, when the Federal Trade Commission—the agency that would be responsible for enforcing these new laws—is holding an all-day workshop on age verification. Apple’s head of government affairs, Nick Rossi, will be there. He’ll be joined by higher-ups in child safety at Google and Meta, as well as a company that specializes in marketing to children.

The FTC has become increasingly politicized under President Trump (his firing of the sole Democratic commissioner was struck down by a federal court, a decision that is now pending review by the US Supreme Court). In July, I wrote about signals that the agency is softening its stance toward AI companies. Indeed, in December, the FTC overturned a Biden-era ruling against an AI company that allowed people to flood the internet with fake product reviews, writing that it clashed with President Trump’s AI Action Plan.

Wednesday’s workshop may shed light on how partisan the FTC’s approach to age verification will be. Red states favor laws that require porn websites to verify ages (but critics warn this could be used to block a much wider range of content). Bethany Soye, a Republican state representative who is leading an effort to pass such a bill in her state of South Dakota, is scheduled to speak at the FTC meeting. The ACLU generally opposes laws requiring IDs to visit websites and has instead advocated for an expansion of existing parental controls.

While all this gets debated, though, AI has set the world of child safety on fire. We’re dealing with increased generation of child sexual abuse material, concerns (and lawsuits) about suicides and self-harm following chatbot conversations, and troubling evidence of kids’ forming attachments to AI companions. Colliding stances on privacy, politics, free expression, and surveillance will complicate any effort to find a solution. Write to me with your thoughts.

            <h2>The power of sound in a virtual world</h2>
            <p><strong>MIT Technology Review | 2026-01-26</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2026/01/26/1124655/the-power-of-sound-in-a-virtual-world/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">In an era where business, education, and even casual conversations occur via screens, sound has become a differentiating factor. We obsess over lighting, camera angles, and virtual backgrounds, but how we sound can be just as critical to credibility, trust, and connection.

That’s the insight driving Erik Vaveris, vice president of product management and chief marketing officer at Shure, and Brian Scholl, director of the Perception & Cognition Laboratory at Yale University. Both see audio as more than a technical layer: It’s a human factor shaping how people perceive intelligence, trustworthiness, and authority in virtual settings.

&quot;If you&#39;re willing to take a little bit of time with your audio set up, you can really get across the full power of your message and the full power of who you are to your peers, to your employees, your boss, your suppliers, and of course, your customers,&quot; says Vaveris.

Scholl’s research shows that poor audio quality can make a speaker seem less persuasive, less hireable, and even less credible.

&quot;We know that [poor] sound doesn&#39;t reflect the people themselves, but we really just can&#39;t stop ourselves from having those impressions,&quot; says Scholl. &quot;We all understand intuitively that if we&#39;re having difficulty being understood while we&#39;re talking, then that&#39;s bad. But we sort of think that as long as you can make out the words I&#39;m saying, then that&#39;s probably all fine. And this research showed in a somewhat surprising way, to a surprising degree, that this is not so.&quot;

For organizations navigating hybrid work, training, and marketing, the stakes have become high.

Vaveris points out that the pandemic was a watershed moment for audio technology. As classrooms, boardrooms, and conferences shifted online almost overnight, demand accelerated for advanced noise suppression, echo cancellation, and AI-driven processing tools that make meetings more seamless. Today, machine learning algorithms can strip away keyboard clicks or reverberation and isolate a speaker’s voice in noisy environments. That clarity underpins the accuracy of AI meeting assistants that can step in to transcribe, summarize, and analyze discussions.

The implications across industries are rippling. Clearer audio levels the playing field for remote participants, enabling inclusive collaboration. It empowers executives and creators alike to produce broadcast-quality content from the comfort of their home office. And it offers companies new ways to build credibility with customers and employees without the costly overhead of traditional production.

Looking forward, the convergence of audio innovation and AI promises an even more dynamic landscape: from real-time captioning in your native language to audio filtering, to smarter meeting tools that capture not only what is said but how it’s said, and to technologies that disappear into the background while amplifying the human voice at the center.

&quot;There&#39;s a future out there where this technology can really be something that helps bring people together,&quot; says Vaveris. &quot;Now that we have so many years of history with the internet, we know there&#39;s usually two sides to the coin of technology, but there&#39;s definitely going to be a positive side to this, and I&#39;m really looking forward to it.

In a world increasingly mediated by screens, sound may prove to be the most powerful connector of all.

This episode of Business Lab is produced in partnership with Shure.

Megan Tatum: From MIT Technology Review, I&#39;m Megan Tatum, and this is Business Lab, the show that helps business leaders make sense of new technologies coming out of the lab and into the marketplace.This episode is produced in partnership with Shure.Our topic today is the power of sound. As our personal and professional lives become increasingly virtual, audio is emerging as an essential tool for everything from remote work to virtual conferences to virtual happy hour. While appearance is often top of mind in video conferencing and streaming, audio can be as or even more important, not only to effective communication, but potentially to brand equity for both the speaker and the company.Two words for you: crystal clear.My guests today are Erik Vaveris, VP of Product Management and Chief Marketing Officer at Shure, and Brian Scholl, Director of the Perception & Cognition Laboratory at Yale University.Welcome, Erik and Brian.

Erik Vaveris: Thank you, Megan. And hello, Brian. Thrilled to be here today.

Megan: Fantastic. Thank you both so much for being here. Erik, let&#39;s open with a bit of background. I imagine the pandemic changed the audio industry in some significant ways, given the pivot to our modern remote hybrid lifestyles. Could you talk a bit about that journey and some of the interesting audio advances that arose from that transformative shift?

Erik: Absolutely, Megan. That&#39;s an interesting thing to think about now being here in 2025. And if you put yourself back in those moments in 2020, when things were fully shut down and everything was fully remote, the importance of audio quality became immediately obvious. As people adopted Zoom or Teams or platforms like that overnight, there were a lot of technical challenges that people experienced, but the importance of how they were presenting themselves to people via their audio quality was a bit less obvious. As Brian&#39;s noted in a lot of the press that he&#39;s received for his wonderful study, we know how we look on video. We can see ourselves back on the screen, but we don&#39;t know how we sound to the people with whom we&#39;re speaking.

If a meeting participant on the other side can manage to parse the words that you&#39;re saying, they&#39;re not likely to speak up and say, &quot;Hey, I&#39;m having a little bit of trouble hearing you.&quot; They&#39;ll just let the meeting continue. And if you don&#39;t have a really strong level of audio quality, you&#39;re asking the people that you&#39;re talking to devote way too much brainpower to just determining the words that you&#39;re saying. And you&#39;re going to be fatiguing to listen to. And your message won&#39;t come across. In contrast, if you&#39;re willing to take a little bit of time with your audio set up, you can really get across the full power of your message and the full power of who you are to your peers, to your employees, your boss, your suppliers, and of course your customers. Back in 2020, this very quickly became a marketing story that we had to tell immediately.

And I have to say, it&#39;s so gratifying to see Brian&#39;s research in the news because, to me, it was like, &quot;Yes, this is what we&#39;ve been experiencing. And this is what we&#39;ve been trying to educate people about.&quot; Having the real science to back it up means a lot. But from that, development on improvements to key audio processing algorithms accelerated across the whole AV industry.

I think, Megan and Brian, you probably remember hearing loud keyboard clicking when you were on calls and meetings, or people eating potato chips and things like that back on those. But you don&#39;t hear that much today because most platforms have invested in AI-trained algorithms to remove undesirable noises. And I know we&#39;re going to talk more about that later on.

But the other thing that happened, thankfully, was that as we got into the late spring and summer of 2020, was that educational institutions, especially universities, and also businesses realized that things were going to need to change quickly. Nothing was going to be the same. And universities realized that all classrooms were going to need hybrid capabilities for both remote students and students in the classroom. And that helped the market for professional AV equipment start to recover because we had been pretty much completely shut down in the earlier months. But that focus on hybrid meeting spaces of all types accelerated more investment and more R&D into making equipment and further developing those key audio processing algorithms for more and different types of spaces and use cases. And since then, we&#39;ve really seen a proliferation of different types of unobtrusive audio capture devices based on arrays of microphones and the supporting signal processing behind them. And right now, machine-learning-trained signal processing is really the norm. And that all accelerated, unfortunately, because of the pandemic.

Megan: Yeah. Such an interesting period of change, as you say. And Brian, what did you observe and experience in academia during that time? How did that time period affect the work at your lab?

Brian: I&#39;ll admit, Megan, I had never given a single thought to audio quality or anything like that, certainly until the pandemic hit. I was thrown into this, just like the rest of the world was. I don&#39;t believe I&#39;d ever had a single video conference with a student or with a class or anything like that before the pandemic hit. But in some ways, our experience in universities was quite extreme. I went on a Tuesday from teaching an in-person class with 300 students to being on Zoom with everyone suddenly on a Thursday. Business meetings come in all shapes and sizes. But this was quite extreme. This was a case where suddenly I&#39;m talking to hundreds and hundreds of people over Zoom. And every single one of them knows exactly what I sound like, except for me, because I&#39;m just speaking my normal voice and I have no idea how it&#39;s being translated through all the different levels of technology.

I will say, part of the general rhetoric we have about the pandemic focuses on all the negatives and the lack of personal connection and nuance and the fact that we can&#39;t see how everyone&#39;s paying attention to each other. Our experience was a bit more mixed. I&#39;ll just tell you one anecdote. Shortly after the pandemic started, I started teaching a seminar with about 20 students. And of course, this was still online. What I did is I just invited, for whatever topic we were discussing on any given day, I sent a note to whoever was the clear world leader in the study of whatever that topic was. I said, &quot;Hey, don&#39;t prepare a talk. You don&#39;t have to answer any questions. But just come join us on Zoom and just participate in the conversation. The students will have read some of your work.&quot;

Every single one of them said, &quot;Let me check my schedule. Oh, I&#39;m stuck at home for a year. Sure. I&#39;d be happy to do that.&quot; And that was quite a positive. The students got to meet a who&#39;s who of cognitive science from this experience. And it&#39;s true that there were all these technological difficulties, but that would never, ever have happened if we were teaching the class in real life. That would&#39;ve just been way too much travel and airfare and hotel and scheduling and all of that. So, it was a mixed bag for us.

Erik: That is really interesting. And that&#39;s such a cool idea. And it&#39;s so wonderful that that worked out. I would say that working for a global company, we like to think that, &quot;Oh, we&#39;re all together. And we&#39;re having these meetings. And we&#39;re in the same room,&quot; but the reality was we weren&#39;t in the same room. And there hadn&#39;t been enough attention paid to the people who were conferencing in speaking not their native language in a different time zone, maybe pretty deep into the evening, in some cases. And the remote work that everybody got thrown into immediately at the start of the pandemic did force everybody to start to think more about those types of interactions and put everybody on a level playing field.

And that was insightful. And that helped some people have stronger voices in the work that we were doing than they maybe did before. And it&#39;s also led businesses really across the board, there&#39;s a lot written about this, to be much more focused on making sure that participants from those who may be remote at home, may be in the office, may be in different offices, may be in different time zones, are all able to participate and collaborate on really a level playing field. And that is a positive. That&#39;s a good thing.

Megan: Yeah. There are absolutely some positive side effects there, aren&#39;t there? And it inspired you, Brian, to look at this more closely. And you&#39;ve done a study that shows poor audio quality can actually affect the perception of listeners. So, I wonder what prompted the study, in particular. And what kinds of data did you gather? What methodology did you use?

Brian: Yeah. The motivation for this study was actually a real-world experience, just like we&#39;ve been talking about. In addition to all of our classes moving online with no notice whatsoever, the same thing was true of our departmental faculty meetings. Very early on in the pandemic, we had one of these meetings. And we were talking about some contentious issue about hiring or whatever. And two of my colleagues, who I&#39;d known very well and for many, many years, spoke up to offer their opinions. And one of these colleagues is someone who I&#39;m very close with. We almost always see eye to eye. He was actually a former graduate student of mine once upon a time. And we almost always see eye to eye on things. He happened to be participating in that meeting from an old not-so-hot laptop. His audio quality had that sort of familiar tinny quality that we&#39;re all familiar with. I could totally understand everything he was saying, but I found myself just being a little skeptical.

I didn&#39;t find his points so compelling as usual. Meanwhile, I had another colleague, someone who I deeply respect, I&#39;ve collaborated with, but we don&#39;t always see eye to eye on these things. And he was participating in this first virtual faculty meeting from his home recording studio. Erik, I don&#39;t know if his equipment would be up to your level or not, but he sounded better than real life. He sounded like he was all around us. And I found myself just sort of naturally agreeing with his points, which sort of was notable and a little surprising in that context. And so, we turned this into a study.

We played people a number of short audio clips, maybe like 30 seconds or so. And we had these being played in the context of very familiar situations and decisions. One of them might be like a hiring decision. You would have to listen to this person telling you why they think they might be a good fit for your job. And then afterwards, you had to make a simple judgment. It might be of a trait. How intelligent did that person seem? Or it might be a real-world decision like, &quot;Hey, based on this, how likely would you be to pursue trying to hire them?&quot; And critically, we had people listen to exactly the same sort of scripts, but with a little bit of work behind the scenes to affect the audio quality. In one case, the audio sounded crisp and clear. Recorded with a decent microphone. And here&#39;s what it sounded like.

Audio Clip: After eight years in sales, I&#39;m currently seeking a new challenge which will utilize my meticulous attention to detail and friendly professional manner. I&#39;m an excellent fit for your company and will be an asset to your team as a senior sales manager.

Brian: Okay. Whatever you think of the content of that message, at least it&#39;s nice and clear. Other subjects listened to exactly the same recording. But again, it had that sort of tinny quality that we&#39;re all familiar with when people&#39;s voices are filtered through a microphone or a recording setup that&#39;s not so hot. That sounded like this.

Audio Clip: After eight years in sales, I&#39;m currently seeking a new challenge which will utilize my meticulous attention to detail and friendly professional manner. I&#39;m an excellent fit for your company and will be an asset to your team as a senior sales manager.

Brian: All right. Now, the thing that I hope you can get from that recording there is that although it clearly has this what we would call, as a technical term, a disfluent sound, it&#39;s just a little harder to process, you are ultimately successful, right? Megan, Erik, you were able to understand the words in that second recording.

Brian: And we made sure this was true for all of our subjects. We had them do word-for-word transcription after they made these judgments. And I&#39;ll also just point out that this kind of manipulation clearly can&#39;t be about the person themselves, right? You couldn&#39;t make your voices sound like that in real world conversation if you tried. Voices just don&#39;t do those sorts of things. Nevertheless, in a way that sort of didn&#39;t make sense, that was kind of irrational because this couldn&#39;t reflect the person, this affected all sorts of judgments about people.

So, people were judged to be about 8% less hirable. They were judged to be about 8% less intelligent. We also did this in other contexts. We did this in the context of dateability as if you were listening to a little audio clip from someone who was maybe interested in dating you, and then you had to make a judgment of how likely would you be to date this person. Same exact result. People were a little less datable when their audio was a little more tinny, even though they were completely understandable.

The experiment, the result that I thought was in some ways most striking is one of the clips was about someone who had been in a car accident. It was a little narrative about what had happened in the car accident. And they were talking as if to the insurance agent. They were saying, &quot;Hey, it wasn&#39;t my fault. This is what happened.&quot; And afterwards, we simply had people make a natural intuitive judgment of how credible do you think the person&#39;s story was. And when it was recorded with high-end audio, these messages were judged to be about 8% more credible in this context. So those are our experiments. What it shows really is something about the power of perception. We know that that sort of sound doesn&#39;t reflect the people themselves, but we really just can&#39;t stop ourselves from having those impressions made. And I don&#39;t know about you guys, but, Erik, I think you&#39;re right, that we all understand intuitively that if we&#39;re having difficulty being understood while we&#39;re talking, then that&#39;s bad. But we sort of think that as long as you can make out the words I&#39;m saying, then that&#39;s probably all fine. And this research showed in a somewhat surprising way to a surprising degree that this is not so.

Megan: From an industry perspective, Erik, what are your thoughts on those study results? Did it surprise you as well?

Erik: No, like I said, I found it very, very gratifying because we invest a lot in trying to make sure that people understand the importance of quality audio, but we kind of come about that intuitively. Our entire company is audio people. So of course, we think that. And it&#39;s our mission to help other people achieve those higher levels of audio in everything that they do, whether you&#39;re a minister at a church or you&#39;re teaching a class or you&#39;re performing on stage. When I first saw in the news about Brian&#39;s study, I think it was the NPR article that just came up in one of my feeds. I read it and it made me feel like my life&#39;s work has been validated to some extent. I wouldn&#39;t say we were surprised by it, but iIt made a lot of sense to us. Let&#39;s put it that way.

Brian: This is what we&#39;re hearing. Oh, sorry. Megan, I was going to say this is what we&#39;re hearing from a lot of the audio professionals as they&#39;re saying, &quot;Hey, you scientists, you finally caught up to us.&quot; But of course-

Brian: Erik, you&#39;re in an unusual circumstance because you guys think about audio every day. When we&#39;re on Zoom, look, I can see the little rectangle as well as you can. I can see exactly how I look like. I can check the lighting. I check my hair. We all do that every day. But I would say most people really, they use whatever microphone came with their setup, and never give a second thought to what they sound like because they don&#39;t know what they sound like.

Megan: Avoid listening to yourself back as well. I think that&#39;s common. We don&#39;t scrutinize audio as much as we should. I wonder, Erik, since the study came out, how are you seeing that research play out across industry? Can you talk a bit about the importance of strong, clear audio in today&#39;s virtual world and the challenges that companies and employees are facing as well?

Erik: Yeah. Sure, Megan. That&#39;s a great question. And studies kind of back this up, businesses understand that collaboration is the key to many things that we do. They know that that&#39;s critical. And they are investing in making the experiences for the people at work better because of that knowledge, that intuitive understanding. But there are challenges. It can be expensive. You need solutions that people who are going to walk into a room or join a meeting on their personal device, that they&#39;re motivated to use and that they can use because they&#39;re simple. You also have to overcome the barriers to investment. We in the AV industry have had to look a lot at how can we bring down the overall cost of ownership of setting up AV technology because, as we&#39;ve seen, the prices of everything that goes into making a product are not coming down.

Simplifying deployment and management is critical. Beyond just audio technology, IoT technology and cloud technology for IT teams to be able to easily deploy and manage classrooms across an entire university campus or conference rooms across a global enterprise are really, really critical. And those are quickly evolving. And integrations with more standard common IT tools are coming out. And that&#39;s one area. Another thing is just for the end user, having the same user interface in each conference room that is familiar to everyone from their personal devices is also important. For many, many years, a lot of people had the experience where, &quot;Hey, it&#39;s time we&#39;re going to actually do a conference meeting.&quot; And you might have a few rooms in your company or in your office area that could do that. And you walk into the meeting room. And how long does it take you to actually get connected to the people you&#39;re going to talk with?

There was always a joke that you&#39;d have to spend the first 15 minutes of a meeting working all of that out. And that&#39;s because the technology was fragmented and you had to do a lot of custom work to make that happen. But these days, I would say platforms like Zoom and Teams and Google and others are doing a really great job with this. If you have the latest and greatest in your meeting rooms and you know how to join from your own personal device, it&#39;s basically the same experience. And that is streamlining the process for everyone. Bringing down the costs of owning it so that companies can get to those benefits to collaboration is kind of the key.

Megan: I was going to ask if we could dive a little deeper into that kind of audio quality, the technological advancements that AI has made possible, which you did touch on slightly there, Erik. What are the most significant advancements, in your view? And how are those impacting the ways we use audio and the things we can do with it?

Erik: Okay. Let me try to break that down into-

Erik: ... a couple different sections. Yeah. No, and one that&#39;s just so exciting. Machine-learning-based digital signal processing, or DSP, is here and is the norm now. If you think about the beginning of telephones and teleconferencing, just going way back, one of the initial problems you had whenever you tried to get something out of a dedicated handset onto a table was echo. And I&#39;m sure we&#39;ve all heard that at some point in our life. You need to have a way to cancel echo. But by the way, you also want people to be able to speak at the same time on both ends of a call. You get to some of those very rudimentary things. Machine learning is really supercharging those algorithms to provide better performance with fewer trade-offs, fewer artifacts in the actual audio signal.

Noise reduction has come a long way. I mentioned earlier on, keyboard sounds and the sounds of people eating, and how you just don&#39;t hear that anymore, at least I don&#39;t when I&#39;m on conference calls. But only a few years ago, that could be a major problem. The machine-learning-trained digital signal processing is in the market now and it&#39;s doing a better job than ever in removing things that you don&#39;t want from your sound. We have a new de-verberation algorithm, so if you have a reverberant room with echoes and reflections that&#39;s getting into the audio signal, that can degrade the experience there. We can remove that now. Another thing, the flip side of that is that there&#39;s also a focus on isolating the sound that you do want and the signal that you do want.

Microsoft has rolled out a voice print feature in Teams that allows you, if you&#39;re willing, to provide them with a sample of your voice. And then whenever you&#39;re talking from your device, it will take out anything else that the microphone may be picking up so that even if you&#39;re in a really noisy environment outdoors or, say, in an airport, the people that you&#39;re speaking with are going to hear you and only you. And it&#39;s pretty amazing as well. So those are some of the things that are happening today and are available today.

Another thing that&#39;s emerged from all of this is we&#39;ve been talking about how important audio quality is to the people participating in a discussion, the people speaking, the people listening, how everyone is perceived, but a new consumer, if you will, of audio in a discussion or a meeting has emerged, and that is in the form of the AI agent that can summarize meetings and create action plans, do those sorts of things. But for it to work, a clean transcription of what was said is already table stakes. It can&#39;t garbled. It can&#39;t miss key things. It needs to get it word for word, sentence for sentence throughout the entire meeting. And the ability to attribute who said what to the meeting participants, even if they&#39;re all in the same room, is quickly upon us. And the ability to detect and integrate sentiment and emotion of the participants is going to become very important as well for us to really get the full value out of those kinds of AI agents.

So audio quality is as important as ever for humans, as Brian notes, in some ways more important because this is now the normal way that we talk and meet, but it&#39;s also critical for AI agents to work properly. And it&#39;s different, right? It&#39;s a different set of considerations. And there&#39;s a lot of emerging thought and work that&#39;s going into that as well. And boy, Megan, there&#39;s so much more we could say about this beyond meetings and video conferences. AI tools to simplify the production process. And of course, there&#39;s generative AI of music content. I know that&#39;s beyond the scope of what we&#39;re talking about. But it&#39;s really pretty incredible when you look around at the work that&#39;s happening and the capabilities that are emerging.

Megan: Yeah. Absolutely. Sounds like there are so many elements to consider and work going on. It&#39;s all fascinating. Brian, what kinds of emerging capabilities and use cases around AI and audio quality are you seeing in your lab as well?

Brian: Yeah. Well, I&#39;m sorry that Brian himself was not able to be here today, but I&#39;m an AI agent.

Brian: Just kidding. The fascinating thing that we&#39;re seeing from the lab, from the study of people&#39;s impressions is that all of this technology that Erik has described, when it works best, it&#39;s completely invisible. Erik, I loved your point about not hearing potato chips being eaten or rain in the background or something like that. You&#39;re totally right. I used to notice that all the time. I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve noticed that recently, but I also didn&#39;t notice that I haven&#39;t noticed that recently, right? It just kind of disappears. The interesting thing about these perceptual impressions, we&#39;re constantly drawing intuitive conclusions about people based on how they sound. And that might be a good thing or a bad thing when we&#39;re judging things like trustworthiness, for example, on the basis of a short audio clip.

But clearly, some of these things are valid, right? We can judge the size of someone or even of an animal based on how they sound, right? A chihuahua can&#39;t make the sound of a lion. A lion can&#39;t make the sound of a chihuahua. And that&#39;s always been true because we&#39;re producing audio signals that go right into each other&#39;s ears. And now, of course, everything that Erik is talking about, that&#39;s not true. It goes through all of these different layers of technology increasingly fueled by AI. But when that technology works the best way, it&#39;s as if it isn&#39;t there at all and we&#39;re just hearing each other directly.

Erik: That&#39;s the goal, right? That it&#39;s seamless open communication and we don&#39;t have to think about the technology anymore.

Brian: It&#39;s a tough business to be in, I think, though, Erik, because people have to know what&#39;s going on behind the surface in order to value it. Otherwise, we just expect it to work.

Erik: Well, that&#39;s why we try to put the logo of our products on the side of them so they show up in the videos. But yeah, it&#39;s a good point.

Megan: And we&#39;ve talked about virtual meetings and conversations quite a bit, but there&#39;s also streamed and recorded content, which are increasingly important at work as well. I wondered, Erik, if you could talk a bit about how businesses are leveraging audio in new ways for things like marketing campaigns and internal upskilling and training and areas like that?

Erik: Yeah. Well, one of the things I think we&#39;ve all seen in marketing is that not everything is a high production value commercial anymore. And there&#39;s still a place for that, for sure. But people tend to trust influencers that they follow. People search on TikTok, on YouTube for topics. Those can be the place that they start. And as technology&#39;s gotten more accessible, not just audio, but of course, the video technology too, content creators can produce satisfying content on their own or with just a couple of people with them. And Brian&#39;s study shows that it doesn&#39;t really matter what the origins of the content are for it to be compelling.

For the person delivering the message to be compelling, the audio quality does have to hit a certain level. But because the tools are simpler to use and you need less things to connect and pull together a decent production system, creator-driven content is becoming even more and more integral to a marketing campaign. And so not just what they maybe post on their Instagram page or post on LinkedIn, for example, but us as a brand being able to take that content and use that actually in paid media and things like that is all entirely possible because of the overall quality of the content. So that&#39;s something that&#39;s been a trend that&#39;s been in process really, I would say, maybe since the advent of podcasts. But it&#39;s been an evolution. And it&#39;s come a long, long way.

Another thing, and this is really interesting, and this hits home personally, but I remember when I first entered the workforce, and I hope I&#39;m not showing my age too badly here, but I remember the word processing department. And you would write down on a piece of paper, like a memo, and you would give it to the word processing department and somebody would type it up for you. That was a thing. And these days, we&#39;re seeing actually more and more video production with audio, of course, transfer to the actual producers of the content.

In my company, at Shure, we make videos for different purposes to talk about different initiatives or product launches or things that we&#39;re doing just for internal use. And right now, everybody, including our CEO, she makes these videos just at her own desk. She has a little software tool and she can show a PowerPoint and herself and speak to things. And with very, very limited amount of editing, you can put that out there. And I&#39;ve seen friends and colleagues at other companies in very high-level roles just kind of doing their own production. Being able to buy a very high quality microphone with really advanced signal processing built right in, but just plug it in via USB and have it be handled as simply as any consumer device, has made it possible to do really very useful production where you are going to actually sound good and get your message across, but without having to make such a big production out of it, which is kind of cool.

Megan: Yeah. Really democratizes access to sort of creating high quality content, doesn&#39;t it? And of course, no technology discussion is complete without a mention of return on investment, particularly nowadays. Erik, what are some ways companies can get returns on their audio tech investments as well? Where are the most common places you see cost savings?

Erik: Yeah. Well, we collaborated on a study with IDC Research. And they came up with some really interesting findings on this. And one of them was, no surprise, two-thirds or more of companies have taken action on improving their communication and collaboration technology, and even more have additional or initial investments still planned. But the ROI of those initiatives isn&#39;t really tied to the initiative itself. It&#39;s not like when you come out with a new product, you look at how that product performs, and that&#39;s the driver of your ROI. The benefits of smoother collaboration come in the form of shorter meetings, more productive meetings, better decision-making, faster decision-making, stronger teamwork. And so to build an ROI model, what IDC concluded was that you have to build your model to account for those advantages really across the enterprise or across your university, or whatever it may be, and kind of up and down the different set of activities where they&#39;re actually going to be utilized.

So that can be complex. Quantifying things can always be a challenge. But like I said, companies do seem to understand this. And I think that&#39;s because, this is just my hunch, but because everybody, including the CEO and the CFO and the whole finance department, uses and benefits from collaboration technology too. Perhaps that&#39;s one reason why the value is easier to convey. Even if they have not taken the time to articulate things like we&#39;re doing here today, they know when a meeting is good and when it&#39;s not good. And maybe that&#39;s one of the things that&#39;s helping companies to justify these investments. But it&#39;s always tricky to do ROI on projects like that. But again, focusing on the broader benefits of collaboration and breaking it down into what it means for specific activities and types of meetings, I think, is the way to go about doing that.

Megan: Absolutely. And Brian, what kinds of advancements are you seeing in the lab that perhaps one day might contribute to those cost savings?

Brian: Well, I don&#39;t know anything about cost savings, Megan. I&#39;m a college professor. I live a pure life of the mind.

Brian: ROI does not compute for me. No, I would say we are in an extremely exciting frontier right now because of AI and many different technologies. The studies that we talked about earlier, in one sense, they were broad. We explored many different traits from dating to hiring to credibility. And we isolated them in all sorts of ways we didn&#39;t talk about. We showed that it wasn&#39;t due to overall affect or pessimism or something like that. But in those studies, we really only tested one very particular set of dimensions along which an audio signal can vary, which is some sort of model of clarity. But in reality, the audio signal is so multi-dimensional. And as we&#39;re getting more and more tools these days, we can not only change audio along the lines of clarity, as we&#39;ve been talking about, but we can potentially manipulate it in all sorts of ways.

We&#39;re very interested in pushing these studies forward and in exploring how people&#39;s sort of brute impressions that they make are affected by all sorts of things. Meg and Erik, we walk around the world all the time making these judgments about people, right? You meet someone and you&#39;re like, &quot;Wow, I could really be friends with them. They seem like a great person.&quot; And you know that you&#39;re making that judgment, but you have no idea why, right? It just seems kind of intuitive. Well, in an audio signal, when you&#39;re talking to someone, you can think of, &quot;What if their signal is more bass heavy? What if it&#39;s a little more treble heavy? What if we manipulate it in this way? In that way?&quot;

When we talked about the faculty meeting that motivated this whole research program, I mentioned that my colleague, who was speaking from his home recording studio, he actually didn&#39;t sound clear like in real life. He sounded better than in real life. He sounded like he was all around us. What is the implication of that? I think there&#39;s so many different dimensions of an audio signal that we&#39;re just being able to readily control and manipulate that it&#39;s going to be very exciting to see how all of these sorts of things impact our impressions of each other.

Megan: And there may be some overlap with this as well, but I wondered if we could close with a future forward look, Brian. What are you looking forward to in emerging audio technology? What are some exciting opportunities on the horizon, perhaps related to what you were just talking about there?

Brian: Well, we&#39;re interested in studying this from a scientific perspective. Erik, you talked about how when you started. When I started doing this science, we didn&#39;t have a word processing department. We had a stone tablet department. But I hear tell that the current generation, when they send photos back and forth to each other, that they, as a matter, of course, they apply all sorts of filters-

Brian: ... to those video signals, those video or just photographic signals. We&#39;re all familiar with that. That hasn&#39;t quite happened with the audio signals yet, but I think that&#39;s coming up as well. You can imagine that you record yourself saying a little message and then you filter it this way or that way. And that&#39;s going to become the Wild West about the kinds of impressions we make on each other, especially if and when you don&#39;t know that those filters have been operating in the first place.

Megan: That&#39;s so interesting. Erik, what are you looking forward to in audio technology as well?

Erik: Well, I&#39;m still thinking about what Brian said.

Erik: I have to go back again. I&#39;ll go back to the past, maybe 15 to 20 years. And I remember at work, we had meeting rooms with the Starfish phones in the middle of the table. And I remember that we would have international meetings with our partners there that were selling our products in different countries, including in Japan and in China, and the people actually in our own company in those countries. We knew the time zone was bad. And we knew that English wasn&#39;t their native language, and tried to be as courteous as possible with written materials and things like that. But I went over to China, and I had to actually be on the other end of one of those calls. And I&#39;m a native English speaker, or at least a native Chicago dialect of American English speaker. And really understanding how challenging it was for them to participate in those meetings just hit me right between the eyes.

We&#39;ve come so far, which is wonderful. But I think of a scenario, and this is not far off, there are many companies working on this right now, where not only can you get a real time captioning in your native language, no matter what the language of the participant, you can actually hear the person who&#39;s speaking&#39;s voice manipulated into your native language.

I&#39;m never going to be a fluent Japanese or Chinese speaker, that&#39;s for sure. But I love the thought that I could actually talk with people and they could understand me as though I were speaking their native language, and that they could communicate to me and I could understand them in the way that they want to be understood. I think there&#39;s a future out there where this technology can really be something that helps bring people together. Now that we have so many years of history with the internet, we know there&#39;s usually two sides to the coin of technology, but there&#39;s definitely going to be a positive side to this, and I&#39;m really looking forward to it.

Meet the new biologists treating LLMs like aliens

How large is a large language model? We now coexist with machines so vast and so complicated that nobody quite understands what they are, how they work, or what they can really do—not even the people who build them.That’s a problem. Even though nobody fully understands how it works—and thus exactly what its limitations might be—hundreds of millions of people now use this technology every day.

To help overcome our ignorance, researchers are studying LLMs as if they were doing biology or neuroscience on vast living creatures—city-size xenomorphs that have appeared in our midst. And they’re discovering that large language models are even weirder than they thought. Read the full story.—Will Douglas Heaven

Job titles of the future: Head-transplant surgeon

The Italian neurosurgeon Sergio Canavero has been preparing for a surgery that might never happen. His idea? Swap a sick person’s head—or perhaps just the brain—onto a younger, healthier body.Canavero caused a stir in 2017 when he announced that a team he advised in China had exchanged heads between two corpses. But he never convinced skeptics that his technique could succeed—or to believe his claim that a procedure on a live person was imminent.

Canavero may have withdrawn from the spotlight, but the idea of head transplants isn’t going away. Instead, he says, the concept has recently been getting a fresh look from life-extension enthusiasts and stealth Silicon Valley startups. Read the full story.

In science fiction, they were envisioned as a fundamental part of the future—even in dystopias like George Orwell’s 1984, where they help to deliver orders for the main character, Winston Smith, in his job rewriting history to fit the ruling party’s changing narrative.In real life, the tubes were expected to transform several industries in the late 19th century through the mid-20th. For a while, the United States took up the systems with gusto.But by the mid to late 20th century, use of the technology had largely fallen by the wayside, and pneumatic tube technology became virtually obsolete.

For the past two decades, there’s been a clear first step for anyone who starts experiencing new medical symptoms: Look them up online. The practice was so common that it gained the pejorative moniker “Dr. Google.” But times are changing, and many medical-information seekers are now using LLMs. According to OpenAI, 230 million people ask ChatGPT health-related queries each week.

That’s the context around the launch of OpenAI’s new ChatGPT Health product, which debuted earlier this month. The big question is: can the obvious risks of using AI for health-related queries be mitigated enough for them to be a net benefit? Read the full story.

In the final weeks of 2025, the battle over regulating artificial intelligence in the US reached boiling point. On December 11, after Congress failed twice to pass a law banning state AI laws, President Donald Trump signed a sweeping executive order seeking to handcuff states from regulating the booming industry.

Instead, he vowed to work with Congress to establish a “minimally burdensome” national AI policy. The move marked a victory for tech titans, who have been marshaling multimillion-dollar war chests to oppose AI regulations, arguing that a patchwork of state laws would stifle innovation.

In 2026, the battleground will shift to the courts. While some states might back down from passing AI laws, others will charge ahead. Read our story about what’s on the horizon.

This week marked a rather unpleasant anniversary: It’s a year since Texas reported a case of measles—the start of a significant outbreak that ended up spreading across multiple states. Since the start of January 2025, there have been over 2,500 confirmed cases of measles in the US. Three people have died.

As vaccination rates drop and outbreaks continue, scientists have been experimenting with new ways to quickly identify new cases and prevent the disease from spreading. And they are starting to see some success with wastewater surveillance. Read the full story.

After falling steadily for decades, the prevalence of global hunger is now on the rise—nowhere more so than in sub-Saharan Africa.

Africa’s indigenous crops are often more nutritious and better suited to the hot and dry conditions that are becoming more prevalent, yet many have been neglected by science, which means they tend to be more vulnerable to diseases and pests and yield well below their theoretical potential.

Now the question is whether researchers, governments, and farmers can work together in a way that gets these crops onto plates and provides Africans from all walks of life with the energy and nutrition that they need to thrive, whatever climate change throws their way. Read the full story.

In the final weeks of 2025, the battle over regulating artificial intelligence in the US reached a boiling point. On December 11, after Congress failed twice to pass a law banning state AI laws, President Donald Trump signed a sweeping executive order seeking to handcuff states from regulating the booming industry. Instead, he vowed to work with Congress to establish a “minimally burdensome” national AI policy, one that would position the US to win the global AI race. The move marked a qualified victory for tech titans, who have been marshaling multimillion-dollar war chests to oppose AI regulations, arguing that a patchwork of state laws would stifle innovation.

In 2026, the battleground will shift to the courts. While some states might back down from passing AI laws, others will charge ahead, buoyed by mounting public pressure to protect children from chatbots and rein in power-hungry data centers. Meanwhile, dueling super PACs bankrolled by tech moguls and AI-safety advocates will pour tens of millions into congressional and state elections to seat lawmakers who champion their competing visions for AI regulation.

Trump’s executive order directs the Department of Justice to establish a task force that sues states whose AI laws clash with his vision for light-touch regulation. It also directs the Department of Commerce to starve states of federal broadband funding if their AI laws are “onerous.” In practice, the order may target a handful of laws in Democratic states, says James Grimmelmann, a law professor at Cornell Law School. “The executive order will be used to challenge a smaller number of provisions, mostly relating to transparency and bias in AI, which tend to be more liberal issues,” Grimmelmann says.

For now, many states aren’t flinching. On December 19, New York’s governor, Kathy Hochul, signed the Responsible AI Safety and Education (RAISE) Act, a landmark law requiring AI companies to publish the protocols used to ensure the safe development of their AI models and report critical safety incidents. On January 1, California debuted the nation’s first frontier AI safety law, SB 53—which the RAISE Act was modeled on—aimed at preventing catastrophic harms such as biological weapons or cyberattacks. While both laws were watered down from earlier iterations to survive bruising industry lobbying, they struck a rare, if fragile, compromise between tech giants and AI safety advocates.

If Trump targets these hard-won laws, Democratic states like California and New York will likely take the fight to court. Republican states like Florida with vocal champions for AI regulation might follow suit. Trump could face an uphill battle. “The Trump administration is stretching itself thin with some of its attempts to effectively preempt [legislation] via executive action,” says Margot Kaminski, a law professor at the University of Colorado Law School. “It’s on thin ice.”

But Republican states that are anxious to stay off Trump’s radar or can’t afford to lose federal broadband funding for their sprawling rural communities might retreat from passing or enforcing AI laws. Win or lose in court, the chaos and uncertainty could chill state lawmaking. Paradoxically, the Democratic states that Trump wants to rein in—armed with big budgets and emboldened by the optics of battling the administration—may be the least likely to budge.

In lieu of state laws, Trump promises to create a federal AI policy with Congress. But the gridlocked and polarized body won’t be delivering a bill this year. In July, the Senate killed a moratorium on state AI laws that had been inserted into a tax bill, and in November, the House scrapped an encore attempt in a defense bill. In fact, Trump’s bid to strong-arm Congress with an executive order may sour any appetite for a bipartisan deal.

The executive order “has made it harder to pass responsible AI policy by hardening a lot of positions, making it a much more partisan issue,” says Brad Carson, a former Democratic congressman from Oklahoma who is building a network of super PACs backing candidates who support AI regulation. “It hardened Democrats and created incredible fault lines among Republicans,” he says.

While AI accelerationists in Trump’s orbit—AI and crypto czar David Sacks among them—champion deregulation, populist MAGA firebrands like Steve Bannon warn of rogue superintelligence and mass unemployment. In response to Trump’s executive order, Republican state attorneys general signed a bipartisan letter urging the FCC not to supersede state AI laws.

With Americans increasingly anxious about how AI could harm mental health, jobs, and the environment, public demand for regulation is growing. If Congress stays paralyzed, states will be the only ones acting to keep the AI industry in check. In 2025, state legislators introduced more than 1,000 AI bills, and nearly 40 states enacted over 100 laws, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.

Efforts to protect children from chatbots may inspire rare consensus. On January 7, Google and Character Technologies, a startup behind the companion chatbot Character.AI, settled several lawsuits with families of teenagers who killed themselves after interacting with the bot. Just a day later, the Kentucky attorney general sued Character Technologies, alleging that the chatbots drove children to suicide and other forms of self-harm. OpenAI and Meta face a barrage of similar suits. Expect more to pile up this year. Without AI laws on the books, it remains to be seen how product liability laws and free speech doctrines apply to these novel dangers. “It’s an open question what the courts will do,” says Grimmelmann.

While litigation brews, states will move to pass child safety laws, which are exempt from Trump’s proposed ban on state AI laws. On January 9, OpenAI inked a deal with a former foe, the child-safety advocacy group Common Sense Media, to back a ballot initiative in California called the Parents & Kids Safe AI Act, setting guardrails around how chatbots interact with children. The measure proposes requiring AI companies to verify users’ age, offer parental controls, and undergo independent child-safety audits. If passed, it could be a blueprint for states across the country seeking to crack down on chatbots.

Fueled by widespread backlash against data centers, states will also try to regulate the resources needed to run AI. That means bills requiring data centers to report on their power and water use and foot their own electricity bills. If AI starts to displace jobs at scale, labor groups might float AI bans in specific professions. A few states concerned about the catastrophic risks posed by AI may pass safety bills mirroring SB 53 and the RAISE Act.

Meanwhile, tech titans will continue to use their deep pockets to crush AI regulations. Leading the Future, a super PAC backed by OpenAI president Greg Brockman and the venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz, will try to elect candidates who endorse unfettered AI development to Congress and state legislatures. They’ll follow the crypto industry’s playbook for electing allies and writing the rules. To counter this, super PACs funded by Public First, an organization run by Carson and former Republican congressman Chris Stewart of Utah, will back candidates advocating for AI regulation. We might even see a handful of candidates running on anti-AI populist platforms.

In 2026, the slow, messy process of American democracy will grind on. And the rules written in state capitals could decide how the most disruptive technology of our generation develops far beyond America’s borders, for years to come.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Warsaw, Poland 26 January 2026 – Rainbow Weather has raised $5.5 million in seed funding to push weather forecasting further into the short-term, high-precision territory it believes the industry still underserves.

The Warsaw-based climate tech startup focuses on hyperlocal, minute-by-minute forecasts, zeroing in on what happens in the next few hours rather than days out.

The round was backed by a syndicate of investors, including Yuri Gurski, founder of Flo Health, one of Europe’s best-known consumer tech unicorns.

Rainbow Weather’s core product is a mobile app that delivers four-hour precipitation forecasts calculated from the exact moment a user checks the weather.

Open the app at 3:51 am, and it forecasts conditions through 7:51am, refreshed every 10 minutes and mapped down to a one-square-kilometre grid. That level of temporal and spatial precision is what the company says sets it apart from mainstream weather apps.

Most major providers, including AccuWeather, Apple Weather, and The Weather Company, still rely on approaches that either simplify cloud movement or depend on large-scale numerical models designed for longer forecasts. According to Rainbow Weather, both methods struggle when conditions change quickly.

“Many legacy forecasting providers rely on optical flow for short-term precipitation forecasting. That’s a fast but simplistic method that treats clouds as shapes in motion, without any understanding of atmospheric physics,” explained Alexander Matveenko, co-founder of Rainbow Weather. “A second category of services uses large-scale mathematical models that do incorporate physical principles, but they’re so cumbersome and slow that they can’t respond quickly to real-time weather changes.”

Rainbow Weather positions itself in between, using machine learning to fuse high-resolution data from radar, satellites, weather stations, and even smartphone barometers. By combining these sources, the company claims it can reduce the noise and bias inherent in individual datasets, then generate forecasts faster than traditional systems.

The app currently focuses on short-term precipitation, but it has expanded into tracking wildfires and hurricanes, a feature added after the Palisades fire in Los Angeles. That expansion reflects a broader ambition to become a real-time risk awareness tool, not just a rain predictor.

The new funding will be used to extend Rainbow Weather’s forecasting window from four hours to 24 hours, add more weather parameters beyond precipitation, and grow its B2B offering.

The commercial weather intelligence market is expected to grow steadily over the next decade, driven by industries that depend on precise, near-term forecasts, from logistics and agriculture to aviation and drone operations.

Rainbow Weather says it has surpassed one million installs and has launched APIs aimed at companies that “can’t afford to get weather wrong.” It has also partnered with an unnamed long-term forecasting firm, supplying near-term data to improve broader climate models.

The founding team brings a track record of exits in applied AI. CEO Yuriy Melnichek previously founded AIMatter, acquired by Google, as well as consumer apps later bought by Pinterest and Farfetch. Matveenko previously sold mapping startup MapData to Mapbox.

Alongside its commercial products, the team also runs weatherindex.ai, an open-source project that evaluates short-term precipitation forecasts from major providers in real time. The tool compares live forecasts against verified airport weather reports, using standard accuracy metrics. It’s an unusual move in an industry not known for transparent benchmarking.

For Rainbow Weather, that openness is part of the pitch. The company is betting that as climate volatility increases, users and businesses will care less about next week’s weather and more about what happens in the next hour, and whether the forecast can be trusted.

Rainbow Weather is a next-gen climate tech startup for ultra-accurate short-term forecasts founded in 2021 by Yuriy Melnichek, who previously built AIMatter (acquired by Google), a neural network-based AI platform, as well as the video creation and editing app Vochi (acquired by Pinterest), and fashion marketplace Wanna (acquired by Farfetch), and Alexander Matveenko, a founder of artificial intelligence mapping startup MapData that he sold to Mapbox in 2017.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">London-based AI video startup Synthesia has raised $200 million in a Series E round, nearly doubling its valuation to around $4 billion and cementing its position as one of Europe’s most valuable AI companies.

The round was led by Google Ventures, with participation from existing investors, underscoring continued appetite for applied AI products that have already found a clear commercial use.

Synthesia builds generative AI tools that let companies create videos using AI-generated avatars instead of cameras, studios, or presenters. The technology has found a strong foothold in corporate training, internal communications, and product explainers, areas where speed, scale, and consistency often matter more than production gloss.

“Synthesia was founded on two core beliefs: first, that AI will bring the cost of content creation down to zero. And secondly, that AI video provides a better, more engaging way for organizations to communicate and learn,” said Victor Riparbelli, Synthesia’s co-founder and CEO.

Synthesia says a significant share of Fortune 100 companies now use its platform, a rare level of enterprise penetration for a European AI startup at this stage. Rather than chasing consumer virality, the company has built its business around predictable, high-value enterprise use cases, a strategy investors have increasingly rewarded over the past year.

The funding comes at a moment when enthusiasm around generative AI has shifted from experimentation to execution. Enterprises are no longer asking whether AI video works, but how reliably it can plug into existing workflows.

Synthesia’s pitch is that AI-generated video should be as routine as slides or documents, created quickly, updated easily, and deployed globally without production bottlenecks.

At a $4 billion valuation, Synthesia joins a small group of European AI companies that have managed to scale beyond regional relevance.

Its rise also highlights a broader pattern: applied AI startups, focused on specific business functions rather than general-purpose models, are attracting some of the largest growth rounds in the market.

For the UK tech ecosystem, the deal is another signal that London remains a serious hub for commercial AI, even as regulatory debates continue around model safety, copyright, and synthetic media.

Synthesia has previously positioned itself as cautious about misuse, building safeguards around consent and disclosure for its avatars, a stance that may become more important as scrutiny of AI-generated content increases.

The challenge ahead is less about proving demand and more about maintaining trust and differentiation as competitors multiply.

But with deep enterprise adoption, a clear product focus, and backing from one of Silicon Valley’s most influential investors, Synthesia is entering its next phase with momentum firmly on its side.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Amsterdam-based hospitality tech platform Mews has raised €255 million (about $300 million) in a Series D funding round as it pushes deeper into automation and AI-powered workflows for hotels around the world.

The round was led by EQT Growth with new participation from Atomico and HarbourVest Partners, alongside existing backers including Kinnevik, Battery Ventures and Tiger Global. The investment values the company at roughly $2.5 billion.

Founded in 2012 by Richard Valtr and Matt Welle, Mews builds a cloud-native “operating system” for hotels  software that ties together reservations, check-ins, housekeeping, payments and more in one platform.

Its technology is designed to replace legacy systems that many hotels still rely on, offering a more flexible, connected way to manage day-to-day operations.

The new funding will be used to expand the company’s AI and automation capabilities at the core of its product.

That includes embedding agent-driven systems that can take on complex routine tasks, reduce manual work for staff and streamline how hotels handle everything from guest interactions to revenue management.

Mews says its platform already supports more than 15,000 properties in 85 countries, and in 2025 it processed nearly 42.3 million check-ins and handled nearly $20 billion in transaction volume.

The software also helped generate over $500 million in additional revenue for hoteliers through features like its Mews Spaces module.

In a statement, CEO Matt Welle said the new capital will help Mews build an operating system that handles operational complexity so hotel teams can focus on guest experience rather than juggling disparate tools.

“We are engineering an operating system that is changing how hoteliers interact with their guests,” CEO Matt Welle said, adding that the goal is to lighten the cognitive load on staff and make everyday operations smoother.

Industry observers say the round is one of the largest ever in hospitality software and reflects broader investor interest in infrastructure-level platforms that bring AI and fintech together for real-world business operations.

As hotels embrace digital transformation, technology that can automate workflows and personalise guest experiences  without adding complexity is increasingly in demand.

For Mews, the challenge now is execution: turning generous funding into tangible upgrades that deliver value for hoteliers of all sizes.

But with strong adoption, a global footprint and a growing suite of automation tools, the company is positioning itself as a central technology partner at a time when hotels are looking to modernise their operations and enhance guest satisfaction.

            <h2>How Flippa Is Removing the Language Barrier from Global Deal-Making</h2>
            <p><strong>The Next Web | 2026-01-23</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://thenextweb.com/news/how-flippa-is-removing-the-language-barrier-from-global-deal-making">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">For decades, access to high-quality deal flow and sophisticated M&A infrastructure has been largely designed for well-connected investors and industry giants. Small businesses and independent founders, particularly those operating outside English-speaking markets, may often find the barriers even higher. Language, geography, and limited access to networks could mean that opportunity stops at the border.

Amidst this trend, Flippa, a platform for buying and selling digital businesses, is rewriting the script and dismantling those barriers. Under the leadership of CEO Blake Hutchison, the company has connected buyers and sellers across continents, linguistic differences, and price points, closing deals from $100,000 up to $10 million. Now, with the launch of its AI-powered multi-language Deal Room, Flippa is addressing what it sees as one of the last major points of disadvantage in global business deals and M&A, calling it the “Language Tax.”

Founded in 2009, Flippa has grown into a global marketplace where entrepreneurs can buy and sell digital assets ranging from e-commerce stores and SaaS businesses to YouTube channels, online communities, and mobile applications. According to Hutchison, the platform supports users from 189 countries, attracting over 450,000 new buyers in the last two years alone. “Our internal data shows that cross-border transactions now account for approximately 85% of all deals completed on the platform,” Hutchison says. “That growth has been especially pronounced in Europe. As a highly fragmented market with high cross-border trade volume but multiple operating languages, I believe Europe often faces structural friction in cross-border dealmaking.”

He notes that European businesses are increasingly being acquired by international buyers, with US-based acquirers representing a significant share of demand. Yet, as deal volumes continue to decline, Hutchison believes that language barriers have historically slowed or derailed otherwise viable transactions.

The company’s new multi-language Deal Room is designed to remove that friction entirely. Within the Deal Room, Hutchison notes that buyers and sellers can now negotiate and transact in their preferred languages. “For example, a French seller can communicate in French with an Italian or English-speaking buyer, who receives the message instantly translated into their own language,” he says, explaining how replies can be translated back in real time, while preserving the original message for verification and clarity.

Hutchison states, “Our goal is to make deal-making as efficient and approachable as possible. Whether you are a SaaS founder in Paris or an e-commerce operator in Berlin, you should be able to negotiate your exit in the language of your choice.”

Alongside the Deal Room translation tool, Flippa has also launched a fully localized French version of its platform, with Spanish scheduled to follow shortly. The expansion reflects the user demand and the reality that French and Spanish are not only widely spoken across Europe, but globally. Spanish is spoken by 550 million people globally, and is spoken widely across the US and Brazil. Similarly, French, being the 5th most widely spoken language in the world, has 321 million speakers, with 61.8% of those speakers living in parts of North Africa and Sub-Saharan Africa, significantly extending the global reach of European-founded businesses.

According to Hutchison, this shift comes as Europe’s M&A market continues to rise again, with an estimated USD412 billion in deal value, with mid-market and digital-first businesses representing one of the fastest-growing segments. Flippa’s role, according to Hutchison, has been to create infrastructure for businesses to source deals with greater reach than elite investment banks, but with a fraction of the cost.

“We often describe Flippa as the investment bank for the 99%,” Hutchison says. “The difference now is that geography and language no longer define who gets access. The demand for cross-border deals was already there. The technology simply needed to catch up.”

Flippa continues to integrate AI-driven discovery, valuation, and outreach tools through its proprietary LaurenAI engine. “The model is trained on more than 200,000 historical listings and transactions,” he explains. “The system then helps buyers identify opportunities, estimate enterprise value, and initiate conversations at scale.” It autonomously indexes the web to identify businesses across SaaS, e-commerce, apps, publishing, and next-generation media.

Human expertise remains embedded in the process, with certified brokers and M&A professionals supporting transactions once a match is made. As Hutchison puts it, “LaurenAI gives people the ability to access off-market deals and build pipelines the same way Wall Street players do, but without the barriers of capital or connections.”

He notes that entrepreneurs who may not feel confident negotiating complex deal terms in English can now access global liquidity without intermediaries or external advisors. At the same time, international buyers can gain visibility into high-quality European businesses that were previously difficult to source or engage.

As digital entrepreneurship continues to globalize, Flippa is positioning itself at the center of a more inclusive M&A ecosystem, one where language is no longer a tax on ambition and opportunities. Flippa’s multi-language Deal Room represents a structural shift in how global deal-making can be done. For founders and buyers alike, it signals a future where the next meaningful transaction can begin in any language, from anywhere in the world.

            <h2>French fintech Pennylane raises €175M</h2>
            <p><strong>The Next Web | 2026-01-23</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://thenextweb.com/news/french-fintech-pennylane-raises-e175m">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Paris-based fintech Pennylane has just pulled off one of Europe’s most noteworthy funding rounds of the year, announcing €175 million in new capital to accelerate its push into artificial intelligence and expand its footprint across the continent. 
The round was led by growth investor TCV, with participation from Blackstone Growth and a group of existing backers that includes Sequoia Capital, DST Global, CapitalG and Meritech Capital.

What makes this raise stand out isn’t just the size of the cheque, though €175 million is hard to ignore in a selective funding market, but the strategic timing and purpose behind it. Pennylane says it didn’t need the capital to survive; it chose to raise now to double down on AI product development and prepare for a phase of market consolidation in European financial software.

Since its founding in 2020, Pennylane has positioned itself as more than just an accounting tool. It has built what it calls a financial operating system for small and mid-sized businesses and the accountants who serve them, bringing invoicing, payments, bookkeeping, and cash-flow management into a shared platform.

That unified approach taps a persistent pain point in Europe’s SME economy, where many companies still stitch together separate systems to manage their finances.

TNW City Coworking space - Where your best work happens

A workspace designed for growth, collaboration, and endless networking opportunities in the heart of tech.

The new funds will support expanded R&D, particularly in generative AI, with early efforts already focused on building intelligent assistants that help accountants interpret data, automate routine bookkeeping, and deliver richer insights to their clients.

The company is also gearing up for regulatory shifts, including electronic invoicing mandates rolling out across several EU countries and refining localisation for key markets like Germany.

Pennylane’s latest round reportedly values the company at about $4.25 billion (€3.6 billion), reinforcing its unicorn status and standing among Europe’s higher-valued fintech startups. That valuation reflects both investor confidence and the company’s growing footprint: Pennylane is used by thousands of accounting firms and hundreds of thousands of businesses across several European markets.

This deal also underscores a broader trend in European tech: AI is moving beyond buzzy chatbots and large language models into critical business infrastructure.

Fintech tools, compliance software, and productivity platforms are increasingly weaving machine learning and automation into once manual workflows. For accountants juggling multiple clients in different jurisdictions, AI isn’t a luxury; it’s a practical way to keep up with regulatory complexity and expectations for real-time financial insights.

Strategically, Pennylane’s timing matters. European financial software is under pressure to modernise rapidly as digital tax reporting and e-invoicing standards become the norm rather than the exception.

By raising capital now, even without immediate pressure,  Pennylane is planting a flag as these shifts accelerate. The presence of heavyweight global investors like TCV and Blackstone signals that international capital still sees promise in Europe’s SaaS and AI stack.

But there’s a deeper dynamic at play. In Europe, fintech innovation often means balancing diversification with consolidation. Investors backing Pennylane now are betting that the company can serve as a common platform for both accountants and SMEs across borders, a role that gets harder as local regulatory regimes and market expectations diverge.

Generative AI, if deployed thoughtfully, could be what ties all those variations together, letting the platform adapt to local tax rules or reporting needs without keeping teams chained to repetitive work.

From Berlin to Barcelona, founders and investors alike are watching to see whether this latest bet on AI financial tooling pays off. In a funding landscape where some sectors have tightened, and valuations have been scrutinised, Pennylane’s ability to attract major global backers while maintaining founder control and avoiding unnecessary dilution signals that Europe’s fintech scene still has room to grow.

For businesses and accountants alike, the surge in capital behind AI-first tools could translate into more seamless workflows, smarter insights, and faster decision-making.

And if Pennylane’s vision plays out, it might not just be a win for one French unicorn, but a sign that European software can innovate too, not by mimicking Silicon Valley, but by solving problems that are uniquely local, and increasingly global.
