            <h2>Riot Games is making an anti-cheat change that could be rough on older PCs</h2>
            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2025-12-19</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/12/some-valorant-players-need-to-update-their-pc-bios-to-keep-anti-cheat-software-happy/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">At this point, most competitive online multiplayer games on the PC come with some kind of kernel-level anti-cheat software. As we’ve written before, this is software that runs with more elevated privileges than most other apps and games you run on your PC, allowing it to load in earlier and detect advanced methods of cheating. More recently, anti-cheat software has started to require more Windows security features like Secure Boot, a TPM 2.0 module, and virtualization-based memory integrity protection.

Riot Games, best known for titles like Valorant and League of Legends and the Vanguard anti-cheat software, has often been one of the earliest to implement new anti-cheat requirements. There’s already a long list of checks that systems need to clear before they’ll be allowed to play Riot’s games online, and now the studio is announcing a new one: a BIOS update requirement that will be imposed on “certain players” following Riot’s discovery of a UEFI bug that could allow especially dedicated and motivated cheaters to circumvent certain memory protections.

In short, the bug affects the input-output memory management unit (IOMMU) “on some UEFI-based motherboards from multiple vendors.” One feature of the IOMMU is to protect system memory from direct access during boot by external hardware devices, which otherwise might manipulate the contents of your PC’s memory in ways that could enable cheating.

The patch for these security vulnerabilities (CVE-2025-11901,  CVE-2025‑14302, CVE-2025-14303, and CVE-2025-14304) fixes a problem where this pre-boot direct memory access (DMA) protection could be disabled even if it was marked as enabled in the BIOS, creating a small window during the boot process where DMA devices could gain access to RAM.

The relative obscurity and complexity of this hardware exploit means that Vanguard isn’t going to be enforcing these BIOS requirements on every single player of its games. For now, it will just apply to “restricted” players of Valorant whose systems, for one reason or another, are “too similar to cheaters who get around security features in order to become undetectable to Vanguard.”

But Riot says it’s considering rolling the BIOS requirement out to all players in Valorant‘s highest competitive ranking tiers (Ascendant, Immortal, and Radiant), where there’s more to be gained from working around the anti-cheat software. And Riot anti-cheat analyst Mohamed Al-Sharifi says the same restrictions could be turned on for League of Legends, though they aren’t currently. If users are blocked from playing by Vanguard, they’ll need to download and install the latest BIOS update for their motherboard before they’ll be allowed to launch the game.

The vulnerability is known to affect four of the largest PC motherboard makers: ASRock, Asus, Gigabyte, and MSI. All four have released updates for at least some of their newer motherboards, while other boards have updates coming later. According to the vulnerability note, it’s unclear whether systems from OEMs like Dell, Lenovo, Acer, or HP are affected.

ASRock’s security bulletin about the issue says it affects Intel boards based on the 500-, 600-, 700-, and 800-series chipsets; MSI only lists the 600- and 700-series chipsets. Asus is also missing the 800-series, but says the vulnerability affects boards based on even older 400-series Intel chipsets; Gigabyte, meanwhile, covers 600-through-800-series Intel chipsets, but is also the only vendor to mention patches for AMD’s 600- and 800-series chipsets (any motherboard with an AM5 socket, in short).

Collectively, all of these chipsets cover Intel’s 10th-generation Core processors and newer, and AMD Ryzen 7000 series and newer.

What’s unclear is whether the boards and chipsets that go unmentioned by each vendor aren’t getting a patch because they don’t need a patch, if they will be patched but they just aren’t being mentioned, or if they aren’t getting a patch at all. The bulletins at least suggest that 400- and 500-series Intel chipsets and 600- and 800-series AMD chipsets could be affected, but not all vendors have promised patches for them.

Crucially, they also don’t mention support for AMD’s socket AM4 chipsets in the 300-through-500 chipset families, or Intel’s 2018-era 300-series chipsets. These boards support Intel’s 8th- and 9th-generation Core CPUs and AMD’s Ryzen 2000, 3000, and 5000 CPU families—all slightly older chips, but CPUs that are otherwise capable of supporting Windows 11 and the standard list of security features that Vanguard requires to do its thing.

We bring this up because the prospect of BIOS-version-based anti-cheat checks raises the possibility that gamers on somewhat older systems could find themselves locked out of games with no recourse, if their system configuration is deemed suspicious or vulnerable and their motherboard or PC manufacturer isn’t offering an update.

Practically speaking, this may not be an issue that affects many players. Even if the BIOS requirement is applied to all top-tier Valorant players, people playing these games at high levels are also usually people who upgrade their systems aggressively, seeking real and perceived competitive advantages that come with higher frame rates and less lag. But if these kinds of requirements creep down Valorant’s competitive ladder or if they become a more common requirement in other anti-cheat software, it could pose a problem for those with older or hand-me-down PCs.

And while some people may be happy to have an excuse to buy a shiny, new upgrade, the fact is that PC upgrading is less rewarding and more difficult right now than it has been in the past. Recent CPU and GPU updates have provided relatively modest performance benefits, and rolling shortages of GPUs, RAM, and other components mean upgrading can get expensive pretty quickly; a motherboard upgrade frequently requires a CPU upgrade and/or a new RAM kit to go along with it. Anything that might force users to upgrade their hardware before they would otherwise want to is worth eyeing skeptically.

We’ve contacted Riot, Intel, AMD, and multiple motherboard vendors for comment to determine whether these older boards are affected by the IOMMU bug and whether they’ll be patched. We’ll update the article if we receive a response.</div>

            <h2>Not too big, not too expensive: The Chevrolet Equinox EV</h2>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">There’s a lot of goodwill out there for the Chevrolet Bolt. As maybe the first properly affordable longer-range electric car on the market, the Bolt wasn’t perfect. It didn’t charge very fast, and people found the seats quite uncomfortable. But it could get more than 230 miles on a single charge—a lot in 2017—and you didn’t have to be flush to afford one. Oh, and it was also pretty good to drive. I know I was a fan from the first time I tried a prototype at CES in 2016.

Understandably, Bolt fans were upset when Chevy decided to kill off the car. Yes, it lacked features compared to more modern EVs, but it is also the brand‘s bestselling EV by quite a country mile. “Not to worry,” said the executives, who told us they had something better coming built on the platform they used to call Ultium but don’t anymore. Starting at around the same $35,000 price tag the Bolt launched with, this would be the new Equinox EV.

That $34,995 price tag was perhaps a bit more appealing when the car was eligible for the now-dead $7,500 IRS clean vehicle tax credit. Truth be told, the LT1 spec is a little bare-boned, and you’ll need to step up to the LT2 we tested—which starts at $40,295—if you want things like heated seats or wireless charging for your devices. (The good news here is that people looking for a bargain should know that used Equinox EVs with decent specs are already much cheaper, just a year after the car’s launch.) And let’s not forget, when the Bolt was young, the more expensive trim was almost $42,000.

You get quite a lot more EV for the money in 2025 than you did in 2017. The Equinox EV is a whole vehicle class bigger, at 190.6 inches (4,840 mm) long, 77 inches (1,954 mm) wide, and 64.8 inches (1,646 mm) tall. It’s also a lot more comfortable than the subcompact was. The seats haven’t been pared down to save space and weight, and the suspension does a decent job of insulating you from the potholes that always grow around this time of year. And there’s a useful amount of storage space, with 26.4 cubic feet (748 L) of cargo volume with the rear seats in use or 57.2 cubic feet (1,620 L) with the rear seats down.

At the heart of the car, between the axles, lives the 85 kWh lithium-ion battery pack, which gives the Equinox EV an EPA range of 319 miles (513 km) on a full charge. Unhelpfully, GM quotes charging as “up to 36 miles of range per hour of charging” for AC level 2 charging (at up to 11.5 kW), or “approximately 77 miles of range in 10 minutes” with a DC fast charger of up to 150 kW, but no 0–100 percent time for AC or 10–80 time for DC charging. We fast-charged the car from 34 percent, without preconditioning the battery first. Charging peaked at 75 kW and took about 45 minutes to reach 80 percent. The charge port is CCS1, although Chevrolet will sell you an adapter to use NACS chargers.

On a full charge, in below-freezing weather, the Equinox reported an estimated 311 miles (500 km) of range, and during our week we averaged 3.5 miles/kWh, despite using the car’s heater because there’s enough else going on in the world that we don’t need to shiver in our cars to prove a point.

An all-wheel-drive version is available, but we tested the front-wheel drive Equinox EV. The permanent magnet synchronous motor generates 220 hp (164 kW) and 243 lb-ft (329 Nm), which is enough to keep things feeling peppy. There are two levels of lift-off regenerative braking available for the one-pedal driving mode, which you toggle on or off via a persistent icon on the 17.7-inch infotainment screen, but even when one-pedal driving is set to off, there’s still some degree of lift-off regen, so you can’t coast the Equinox as you might with a European or Korean EV.

The infotainment screen is bright, legible, and responsive, and the onboard Google Maps navigation works well, particularly with voice inputs. I have to give props to the backup camera, too—one of the crispest and highest resolution I’ve encountered all year. But other voice commands for the Android Automotive OS-based infotainment didn’t always work. And I’ll be frank, I missed being able to use Apple CarPlay, both for listening to my own music and for the messaging integration.

GM has solved the first half of that problem—last week, it started rolling out an Apple Music app to its newer EVs. But the fact remains that removing CarPlay (and Android Auto) was an anti-consumer move by General Motors, which evidently convinced itself that doing so would create the kind of recurring revenue stream that delights stock analysts. Whether those calculations took into account lost sales from customers who won’t buy a car without phone casting remains a question.

Most of the Equinox’s advanced driver assists are standard equipment, including automatic emergency braking (forward, reverse, and rear cross traffic) and lane keeping. But if you want adaptive cruise control you’ll need to spend $3,355 on the Active Safety Package 3, (which comes with three years of OnStar One service, plus an enhanced parking assist), as well as the $3,100 “Convenience Pack II” that adds ventilation and more power adjustment to the front seats, a heads-up display, heated rear seats, dual-zone AC, LED head- and taillights, bigger wheels, and a rear camera mirror.

Although it took a few days, I found myself jelling with the Equinox EV. Even from the perspective of a Bolt fan—for families looking to replace an older Bolt that need something a little larger without being a behemoth, this compact electric crossover makes a compelling case. And those Chevrolet EV fans who need something smaller can take solace in the fact that the Bolt returns next year, with an all-new lithium iron phosphate battery and all-new infotainment.</div>

            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/12/trumps-energy-secretary-orders-a-washington-state-coal-plant-to-remain-open/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">SEATTLE—The last coal-fired power plant in Washington state was set to go cold at the end of the year. It would then switch to natural gas, cutting carbon emissions in half.

The shutdown had been in the works for 15 years and was mandated by state law. It required the Canadian energy company that owns the power plant, TransAlta, to retrain workers and ease the local community’s economic transition.

But the farewell to coal was canceled this week by the Trump administration. In furtherance of the president’s crusade to keep America’s coal plants burning, the Department of Energy announced Tuesday that an “emergency exists” in the Pacific Northwest “due to a shortage of electricity.” To keep the lights on, Energy Secretary Chris Wright said that the Centralia electric generating facility in southwest Washington must continue to burn coal for at least 90 more days.

“Issuance of this order will meet the emergency and serve the public interest,” said Wright, who issued a similar order last summer that blocked the planned retirement of an aging coal-fired plant in Michigan.

There is, however, no imminent shortage of electricity in Washington state or across the Pacific Northwest, according to state officials and regional energy experts.

“Let’s be clear: there’s no emergency here,” said a joint statement by Washington Gov. Bob Ferguson, along with the state’s attorney general and ecology director. “The Trump administration has conveniently ignored the law and the facts. The TransAlta power plant is days away from completing its shutdown—a milestone the company and the state have been working toward since 2011. The workers have moved on. There’s no coal left to burn.”

The governor’s office and local environmental groups said they were examining the Trump administration order and may fight it in court. TransAlta said in a statement that it is “evaluating” the federal order but remains committed to a coal-to-gas conversion at the Centralia plant.

The year-end emergency that does exist in Washington state has been caused by record-setting rainfall and widespread flooding. (President Donald Trump has declared a federal emergency and authorized disaster assistance.) Thousands of people have been displaced and damage to major highways will take months to repair.

“It is so ironic, when we have a real emergency, that they picked this time to fabricate an energy emergency,” said KC Golden, a member of the Northwest Power and Conservation Council, an interstate agency created by Congress to ensure reliable power while protecting the environment.

While there is no emergency electricity shortfall in the Pacific Northwest, the region, like much of the United States, does have a serious and worsening long-term electricity supply problem.

Washington and Oregon are home to about 100 data centers. Oregon is second only to Virginia in data center capacity, and the centers consume 11 percent of Oregon’s power supply, nearly three times the national average, according to the Sightline Institute, a Seattle think tank.

Energy use is rising along with the region’s booming high-tech economy, its outsized appetite for electric cars (The Seattle Times reported that 26 percent of new cars registered in Washington in October were EVs) and the climate-change-driven growth of home air-conditioning. The Northwest could face a 9-gigawatt shortfall of power by 2030, according to a recent utility-funded report by the energy consulting group E3. Nine gigawatts is roughly the electricity load of Oregon.

“We are facing a real energy supply challenge and we have been slow to take up that challenge,” said Golden, who represents Washington state on the Northwest power council.

The Pacific Northwest gets more of its power from hydroelectric dams than any other part of the country (60 percent in Washington), and the region has long been blessed with cheap electricity rates. But drought and changing weather patterns (less snow, more rain) have hammered the reliability of the system, which draws most of its power from big federal dams on the Columbia River, North America’s largest hydroelectric resource.

Grand Coulee Dam, the largest electricity producer in the United States, last year generated about half as much power as it did in 2012, according to the US Energy Information Administration. Power production in the Northwest and across the West fell to a 22-year low in 2022–2023, largely because of a years-long drought.

Making matters worse, the Bonneville Power Administration, a federal agency that sells electricity from Columbia River dams and operates a high-voltage transmission system, has been exceedingly slow to connect new sources of power—wind and solar—to the grid. An investigation this year by ProPublica and Oregon Public Broadcasting found that of 469 large renewable projects that applied to connect to Bonneville’s system since 2015, one was approved. Bonneville has said it is working to speed up the process. ProPublica also found that Oregon and Washington—while promising to eliminate fossil fuels from the grid—trailed most states in connecting large solar and wind projects.

“It takes too long to build new transmission,” said Lauren McCloy, utility and regulatory director of the NW Energy Coalition, an alliance of environmental groups, local utilities and local government agencies. “But we are all working on it.”

McCloy said that the entire Pacific Northwest is trying “to focus on how we can meet our clean energy goals and keep the lights on.” She added that in all the meetings she has attended in recent years, “I haven’t heard anyone in this region point to the [Centralia] coal plant as a solution to this challenge.”

Washington state codified its intention to move away from fossil fuels in 2019. The law mandates the closure this year of all coal-fired plants. It also requires carbon-neutral power production by 2030 and an electricity supply system that is free of greenhouse gas emissions by 2045. Mushrooming power demands of data centers, combined with halting integration of wind and solar into the grid, have raised questions about the state’s ability to enforce its law.

            <h2>Furious Residents Say AI Data Centers Are Sucking Up the Great Lakes</h2>
            <p><strong>Futurism | 2025-12-19</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://futurism.com/science-energy/data-centers-great-lakes">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Throughout the United States, data centers are popping up like weeds, devouring water and electricity to fuel the unprecedented demand for AI training and inference. At the same time, water levels in the Great Lakes are lower than they’ve been in years — sparking ardent opposition in the area that could be a sign of things to come far beyond.

New reporting by The Guardian on data centers’ effects on the Great Lakes — the largest freshwater reserves in the world — spotlights concerns that new data center buildouts are leading to lower-than-average water levels throughout the region.

As companies look for areas to plant their immense AI data centers, the small towns dotting the Great Lakes region have made for appetizing targets. In Perkins Township, Ohio, for example, area farmer Tom Hermes tells The Guardian he was alarmed when Texas-based firm Aligned Data Centers began construction on a new compound nearby. A four-building campus at 200,000 square feet in size, the new facility is going up right next to the land Hermes uses for farming.

“We have city water here. That’s going to reduce the pressure if they are sucking all the water,” he told the publication. “They’re not good, I know that.”

It’s worth pointing out that there are still a lot of questions about exactly how much water AI data centers are using. A recent Wired piece, canvassing experts on the issue of data center water usage, found that it’s a muddy issue with many variables.

“In the near term, it’s not a concern and it’s not a nationwide crisis,” advised Cornell environmental studies professor Fengqi You. “But it depends on location. In locations that have existing water stress, building these AI data centers is gonna be a big problem.”

Indeed, not many are up in arms about the high water demand for, say, the type of industrial agriculture that Hermes is engaged in. According to The Guardian, he raises 130 head of cattle, along with corn, wheat, grass, and soybeans on a 1,200 acre plot — one of the most water-hungry ventures imaginable.

Still, many feel that data centers pose a risk to nearby water tables, and researchers are still fleshing out the actual relationship. It also doesn’t help that the rise of AI infrastructure is coinciding with other environmental crises: in the Great Lakes region, for instance, Lake Erie just recorded its second month in a row of water levels well below the long-term average. Compared to 2019, water levels across the five lakes are down anywhere from two to four feet.

And regardless of its absolute impact, AI’s water use has become an emotional flashpoint in the public’s opposition to the tech. In Port Washington, Wisconsin, for example, community members erupted in protest against a new data center during a recent city council meeting. Three were arrested for disorderly conduct against the facility, which local activist group Clean Wisconsin says will use “much more water than tech companies claim” as a result of electricity generation.

“If non-renewable energy sources are used to meet those needs, its off-site water use would be at least 54 million gallons a day,” the group claimed in a November analysis. “For comparison, that’s the water use of about 970,000 Wisconsin residents.” The caveat here is that without government-mandated transparency, it’s hard to know exactly where that energy is coming from, and how much water is used as a result.

Other towns like Hobart, Indiana and Mount Pleasant, Wisconsin face similar predicaments. In Michigan’s lower peninsula, tech giants have begun work on 16 data center projects in 2025 alone.

Meanwhile, the water level of the Great Lakes is receding fast. “We’re about 12 inches below the long-term average for the lake,” Watershed Center Grand Traverse Bay waterkeeper Heather Smith told Up North Live in late November, referring to Lake Michigan. “We are lower than last month and certainly lower than we were last year.”

            <h2>TikTok Accounts Are Using AI Slop to Sell Seeds to Plants That Don’t Exist</h2>
            <p><strong>Futurism | 2025-12-19</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://futurism.com/artificial-intelligence/tiktok-ai-slop-seeds-plants-dont-exist">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">There are thousands of varieties of hosta — a leafy decorative plant that you’ve probably seen adorning outdoor spaces — being cultivated around the world, in a luxurious spread of colors, sizes, and textures. The hardy and easy-to-care-for plants thrive in the shade and can grow enormous leaves, making them a perfect project for amateur gardeners.

Yet despite the glorious natural biodiversity that already exists in the species, scammers on TikTok are using AI-generated slop videos to sell dubious seeds for hosta varieties that don’t exist.

A quick search for “hosta seeds” reveals countless videos of unnaturally colored hostas, from a fictitious variety featuring enormous, purple leaves, to “God’s rainbow,” a made-up plant that grows garish, rainbow-colored foliage, described as “so magical, your neighbors will think it isn’t real,” according to a robotic-sounding AI voiceover.

“It’s called midnight blue heart,” a voiceover says in a separate video. “A rare black and blue hosta that looks like it came from another planet.”

“It’s magical, it’s hardy, and only a few dollars,” the voice continues. “Tap the link below to order and bring the midnight blue heart home.”

The obvious hallmarks of half-baked AI are impossible to ignore, from water streams from garden hoses that flow straight through the foliage or miss the plant entirely to seeds that magically float by themselves while held in a hand. Many of the videos even claim their miraculous hostas can thrive even in snowy conditions, which is a nonsense prospect: hostas may be perennial, but aren’t very frost-tolerant and sustain damage from freezing temperatures.

The bizarre trend is part of a much larger deluge of AI slop drowning out human-authored content across social media platforms.

Author Bree Bridges noticed her TikTok feed becoming overwhelmed by the videos.

“TikTok has started giving me AI-generated garden content with videos of people supposedly growing plants that quite clearly look like they came from the ‘Avatar’ planet,” Bridges wrote in a post on Bluesky.

“And also they’re watering them indoors sometimes while watering the carpet and they grow in three days,” she added.

Experts have already warned that hosta lovers should stay far away from seeds that purport to grow into fantastical plants. Ads that New York-based NBC-affiliate WHEC showed to Bill Hegeman, co-president of the Genesee Valley Hosta Society, immediately raised red flags.

“Stop!” the TikTok account behind the outdoor living store Touch of Eco exclaimed in a recent clip. “If you see these colorful hosta seeds on TikTok, never buy them. These are fake, AI-generated.”

Even before the advent of generative AI, fake seeds were already a widespread scam on the internet. As YouTuber Atomic Shrimp explored in a video last year, seeds for made-up flowers like “cat face flowers” that inexplicably feature the faces of felines are being sold for considerable amounts of money.

On eBay, for instance, 50 seeds for a “cute cat face orchid” are being sold for $6.68. Poorly photoshopped or possibly AI-generated images show the faces of cats perched in the middle of fantastical plants.

During his investigation, Atomic Shrimp noticed that dodgy seed vendors were all using similar “cookie-cutter sites,” which are “probably very easy, cheap, and quick to deploy from a template.” The sites are also likely “acting as a front end for seedy, pun intended, drop shipping operations where the fulfilment, assuming there is such, is coming from the same sellers that list the same dodgy scam seeds for sale on Wish, AliExpress, Amazon, eBay, and other marketplaces.”

But instead of selling preposterously photoshopped seeds for “rainbow tomatoes,” scammers are using new tactics in a new age defined by AI slop.

One account on TikTok is even recycling the concept of a “cute cat orchid” by animating the images and turning them into a whole video.

Another video shows an adult cat’s face literally blinking its eyes as its disembodied head is reincarnated in the shape of a demonic orchid.

“How have 107 people bought this?” one TikTok account wrote in the comments.

“I can’t believe people actually fell for this,” another added.

            <h2>Investors Warn That Humanoid Robots Are the Next Financial Bubble</h2>
            <p><strong>Futurism | 2025-12-19</strong></p>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">AI powered robots are slowly making their way into our world, from delivery bots on wheels to caregiver bots for the planet’s growing elderly population.

Nothing has captured the imagination of investors quite like humanoid robots, though, as they’ve poured untold billions into the sector amid hype that bots shaped like humans stand to impact almost every part of society — particularly by replacing jobs everywhere from domestic labor to the factory floor.

But a venture capitalist is now issuing a warning: that the current surge of investment dollars toward humanoid robots has the makings of the next financial bubble. Despite all the viral robot dancing videos, she says, the reality is that there are still an imposing number of technical kinks to work out — and hence, startups in the space are a long way from generating profits.

“[I]nvestors should remain disciplined and back companies that have realistic goals based on economics, not hype,” said Daiva Rakauskaitė, partner and manager at Aneli Capital, a venture capital firm based in Lithuania, in a company statement. “From day one, startups should aim for early revenue streams through licensing, partnerships and have a clear model of monetization in the near future. The same revenue-first philosophy can be applied to any field.”

She’s not the only one sounding the alarm. China’s leading economic planner, China’s National Development and Reform Commission, has warned that there’s a bubble forming around robotics and startups are making too similar robots from each other, which is inadvertently crowding out money for important research.

That’s on top of skepticism from robotics pioneer Rodney Brooks, inventor of the Roomba vacuum bot, who wrote earlier this year that all these investment dollars are a waste and humanoid robots are not safe enough to perform human tasks due to issues with hand dexterity and walking, among other lingering technical problems. In a nutshell, the gulf between what humanoid robots can do versus marketing hype is huge, Brooks said.

“We’re going to go through a big hype, and then there’s going to be a trough of disappointment,” he told The New York Times. (Underlining his warning: Roomba’s maker iRobot filed for bankruptcy this week.)

But we seem to be on a runaway train when it comes to humanoid robots, because “AI gives humanoids a commercial potential that was previously not possible,” the statement from Aneli reads.

In an October report from business analytics outfit CB Insights, the AI sector grabbed over 50 percent of more than $95 billion in venture capital funding in the third quarter of this year, while industrial humanoid robotic startups bagged 17 business deals.

But that report also warns about hype in the robotics space, saying it still faces “fundamental challenges with inference, dexterity, reliability, and cost, which limit initial use cases to structured environments like factories and warehouses with a controlled and predictable set of tasks.”

So what’s going to happen once the froth is gone: more humanoid robots dancing and working in factories — or junky vaporware bots collecting dust in our closets?

            <div id="article-text">Investors at TechCrunch Disrupt did not shy away from admitting they are interested in mainly one thing: artificial intelligence.

Nina Achadjian from Index, Jerry Chen from Greylock and Peter Deng from Felicis, all spoke about the latest obsession in venture capital and how startups can stand out in a quickly crowding market. The environment is moving fast, Achadjian told the crowd, and companies are experiencing unprecedented growth.

“We spend an enormous, enormous amount of time really assessing the entrepreneur and how resilient they will be able to be in a moment where things are just rapidly changing,” Achadjian said. Now more than ever, founders have to lean into showing their passion, domain expertise, and remain honest about their product market fit, she said.

“There is so much demand from enterprise companies to try the latest and greatest AI, sometimes there’s false positives of product market fit,” she explained, “and you can get a lot of revenue with not having true ROI,” meaning customers who are getting their return on investment.

That leads another consideration VCs are looking for: an ability to pivot as the market twists and turns. “There’s a joke that, like, 1000 startups die and that’s why being resilient is really important,” Achadjian continued.

Deng, who used to work at OpenAI, added to Achadjian’s statements. He said founders need to find their unique data flywheels that are going to separate them from the hordes of everyone pitching the exact same idea, especially since the enterprise companies likely testing their products are also testing out a few other competitors at the same time.

“If you’re able to go deep and really solve a true need for them,” in a way they cannot do themselves, then managing data is “where the important part is,” he said.

Founders should also have an answer for why their product will not just be a feature added into the foundational models, Achadjian said. It may be okay if a founder doesn’t know if the model makers are working on a competor but they should have a hypothesis on how the business is defensible when pitching investors.

Right now, what’s working in AI seems to be three things, Chen noted: Chat apps, coding apps, and AI in customer service. But there is still so much more change to happen throughout early every sector and industry.

Deng is excited by AI-enabled marketplaces. Achadjian, meanwhile, thinks that this could be the moment for robotics, while Chen is curious to see how AI impacts SaaS and othermarkets not yet directly impacted.

As for what’s not AI and exciting? “Pen and paper processes and digitize them,” Achadjian said. There’s a lot of blue-collar industries that, incredibly, still do many processes manually, she continued. But, they acknowledged even that is ripe for the opportunity to be automated by AI.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">AI coding assistant Cursor announced that it has acquired Graphite, a startup that uses AI to review and debug code.

Although the terms of the deal were not disclosed, Axios reported that Cursor paid “way over” Graphite’s last valuation of $290 million, which was set when the five-year-old company raised a $52 million Series B earlier this year.

The tie-up makes strategic sense. The output of code generated by AI is often buggy, forcing engineers to spend a lot of time on corrections. Even though Cursor offers AI-powered code review through its Bugbot product, Graphite’s specialized toolset provides a distinct capability called a ‘stacked pull request,’ which enables developers to work on multiple dependent changes simultaneously without waiting for approvals.

Combining AI-powered code writing with AI-powered code review tools speeds up the process from drafting code to shipping it.

Other startups providing AI-powered code review include CodeRabbit, valued at $550 million in September, and a smaller competitor, Greptile, which announced a $25 million Series A this fall.

Michael Truell, co-founder and CEO of Cursor, first met Graphite’s co-founders, Merrill Lutsky, Greg Foster, and Thomas Reimers, before launching the company as a Neo Scholar, a prestigious program for college students run by Neo, Ali Partovi’s early-stage venture firm. Neo backed Graphite at the seed stage, according to PitchBook data.

Furthermore, both Cursor and Graphite have other investors in common, including Accel and Andreessen Horowitz.

Cursor, which was last at $29 billion in November, has been on an acquisition spree. Last month, it purchased Growth by Design, a tech recruiting strategy company. In July, Cursor scooped up the talent from AI-powered CRM startup Koala for a post-money valuation of $129 million, according to PitchBook.

            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/19/elon-musks-56b-tesla-pay-package-restored-by-delaware-supreme-court/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The Delaware Supreme Court has reinstated Elon Musk’s $56 billion Tesla pay package from 2018, overturning last year’s ruling by the state’s Chancery Court, according to an opinion published Friday.

The state supreme court’s decision draws to a close a years-long battle that left such a bad taste in Musk’s mouth that he moved its incorporation out of Delaware to Texas, which prompted other companies to follow suit.

Tesla will now likely revoke a $29 billion pay package it offered Musk earlier this year, which was meant as a hedge against the possibility that they would lose the Delaware Supreme Court appeal. The $1 trillion compensation package awarded to Musk in November is separate from that, and will continue to exist going forward, giving Musk a series of lofty goals to hit in order to unlock the full value.

The 2018 award also set out a number of milestones that Musk had to hit in order to unlock the full value. Musk and Tesla hit all of those goals, but not before a shareholder filed suit over the award in 2018, arguing that it had been improperly negotiated and that shareholders weren’t properly informed of the conflicts of interest at play.

After years of back-and-forth, including a trial where Musk testified, the Chancery Court judge overseeing the case agreed with the plaintiff and initially struck down the pay package in January 2024. Tesla held a vote at its annual meeting in 2024 where shareholders “re-approved” the package, but the judge confirmed her decision in December 2024. Tesla appealed soon after.

            <h2>What Jeffrey Epstein Didn’t Understand About <em>Lolita</em></h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2025-12-19</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/2026/02/jeffrey-epstein-nabokov-lolita/685320/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">One of the minor annoyances of being an incorrigible pervert is that you risk having your own bookshelf testify against you. Some spines are better turned inward. A pederast might hide away Thomas Mann’s Death in Venice, in which a middle-aged German author ogles a lithe young Polish boy. A hyper-literate rapist should camouflage his copy of A Clockwork Orange with a more consensual dust jacket. It is therefore curious that the late financier and convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein—who died in jail in 2019 while awaiting trial on charges of trafficking minors—flaunted his supposed love of Vladimir Nabokov’s Lolita. The book, first published in France in 1955, is so closely identified with pedophilia that it spawned not one but two words, Lolita and nymphet, for girls whom grown men find sexually tempting. Rather than take the obvious advice—Under no circumstances advertise your obsession with Lolita—Epstein apparently did the opposite.

Check out more from this issue and find your next story to read.

The Epstein files released by Congress yesterday include photos of a young woman or girl, with Lolita’s horny opening lines clumsily inscribed on her skin in fine black ink. Lolita crops up here and there in the documents released in November, too. The journalist Michael Wolff, who was working on a profile of Epstein, wrote that he kept a copy of Lolita, and no other book, on his bedside table. Wolff added that Epstein “is, beyond the joke, a great Nobokov [sic] fan.” When a fact-checker wrote to Epstein to confirm these details, Epstein forwarded the message to Wolff, with a note suggesting that he would not cooperate with the checking process: “nfw,” as in no fucking way. In the end, the profile was never published.

Whether or not he kept a copy by his bed, we know that Epstein owned a first edition and ordered The Annotated Lolita for his Kindle in 2019, 43 days before he was arrested. As to the claim that Epstein was a “great Nobokov fan,” the only possible response is: nfw. He may have wanted others to believe he was, and he may also have tried to impress certain people with polite conversation about the book—maybe the kind of people who do not know how to spell Nabokov, or who wanted his money too much to call out his superficiality. The novel makes a cameo in his 2018 correspondence with the Harvard English professor Elisa New, wife of the hapless Larry Summers, whose poetry project he funded. “I’m going upstairs to hunt for my copy of Lolita,” New says in an email, seemingly at Epstein’s urging. She then suggests that Epstein read Willa Cather’s My Ántonia, writing that Cather’s novel has “similar themes to Lolita in that it’s about a man whose whole life is stamped forever by his impression of a young girl.” The titular girl in Lolita is a 12-year-old who is kidnapped and serially raped by a much older man. To compare Lolita to My Ántonia in this way is a bit like saying Moby-Dick and Deliverance are both about fishing trips.

Still, I doubt that Epstein ever read Lolita, or that he understood it if he did. The book’s pleasures are intense but not erotic, and not congruent with Epstein’s essentially philistine taste. Like Nabokov’s great novel Pale Fire, Lolita is about an intelligent writerly type who is not intelligent enough to realize that he is also completely nuts. It accesses levels of pathos that a psycho like Epstein would struggle to appreciate.

We know from his emails that Epstein purchased an eclectic array of nonfiction, including books on finance, power, and sex, plus random books that might endear him to the powerful men in his orbit. These orders were not all lowbrow. He bought Norman Mailer’s fiery but cerebral anti-feminist polemic The Prisoner of Sex and a Don DeLillo novel, Zero K. Among the down-market acquisitions were installments of the Flashman series—think James Bond, but more bumbling and Victorian—and of The Man From O.R.G.Y., a pulpy 1960s spy-sex romp for readers who considered Pussy Galore too subtle. I found excerpts online: They were so lame and dated that, may God forgive me, I actually felt bad for Epstein. A mega-millionaire is spoiled for company, with outstanding people and experiences available for purchase or rent. To prefer the solitary consumption of a novel with lines like “I was strumming her little passion switch like a banjo player mad with palsy” is beyond pitiful. It shows a simultaneous unfamiliarity with both human sexual response and bluegrass music.

Reading escapist crap now and then does not preclude reading great prose at more serious moments. But if your literary tastes favor the dashing heroism of a spy, a lover, a man of mystery and intrigue—and I suspect that Epstein could read fiction only in this vicarious way—then Lolita is a comically bad choice. Humbert Humbert, the narrator, is unhinged and obtuse. The novel is a joke on him. The actors cast by Hollywood to play Humbert in the two movie adaptations of the novel, James Mason and Jeremy Irons, give a sense of the type: Both are known for playing reptilian creeps, even more grotesquely mismatched for an American tween than the average adult man would be.

Humbert is one of the most odious and self-absorbed creations in all of literature. He is a rapist, a murderer, a world-class deflector of blame (“It was she who seduced me”), and a pompous piece of child-molesting Eurotrash. It is a scandal that he can express himself so well—with the linguistic ingenuity, come to think of it, of Vladimir Nabokov. Much of the plot follows this continental sophisticate and Lolita as they drive across America in a “jalopy,” shacking up in motels and passing vulgar roadside attractions. (Epstein, by contrast, was too much of a snob to debase himself with terrestrial travel. He flew private, in a 727 known unofficially as the “Lolita Express.”)

From the September 2018 issue: Caitlin Flanagan on how Lolita seduces us all

The end of the novel, however, is even more hateful to someone with Epstein’s predilections. Humbert meets his ex-nymphet again when she’s 17. Lolita has grown distant—which is to say, she has grown up—and has sexually emancipated herself from Humbert, though she still wants his money. Now married and pregnant, Lolita has become unattractive to Humbert, and to some extent Humbert has become unattractive to himself, even remorseful about his crimes against her.

To these indignities (the aging of his lover, the seedy motels, the discovery that he is a worm), Humbert adds one more, perhaps the only one with which Epstein could sympathize. At the novel’s end, he refers back to the reason for his writing all of this down in the first place: He is in jail awaiting trial, and these are his notes. Before he can face justice, he will be dead of a heart attack, and Lolita herself will die in childbirth. Note the irony in the plot (a childhood stolen by an adult, and an adulthood lost to a child) and also in the parallel to Epstein, who, like Humbert, cheated justice through an early demise.

Epstein could, I suppose, have seen himself in Humbert, understood Humbert all too well, and simply not regarded him as loathsome. Epstein was, after all, Epstein, and did not inhabit the same moral universe as you and I do. It is a dark thought: Epstein curled up alone under the covers, studying his nightly installment of the novel because he recognized the lust and moral frailty and could not get enough of it. This Humbert fellow—so relatable. A pompous lecher just like me! For that to be the case, Epstein would have needed a capacity for self-deprecation and insight into his own perversity. No evidence for these traits exists.

More likely, Epstein confused Lolita for some kind of Booker Prize–level version of Penthouse Forum, which is a stupid error. The opening lines, the ones written on a female body in the Epstein-file photo, are more autoerotic than erotic, with Humbert self-pleasuring at the thought of his own mouth (“Lo-lee-ta: the tip of the tongue taking a trip of three steps down the palate to tap, at three, on the teeth”).

Reading Lolita as erotica would be a further irony, because in making that category error, he would have been aligning himself with the book’s early moralist critics. “Highbrow pornography,” The New York Times’ Orville Prescott wrote when the book came out in America, noting that even the French had banned it. I suppose it would be unfair to ding a reviewer in 1958, when smut was scarcer, for seeing pornography in all the wrong places, and mistaking this very unsexy book for titillation.

But just as the notion that Epstein read and understood Lolita is implausible, the alternative—that he read the novel and got off on it—is almost too gross to contemplate. To find Lolita sexy would not only mean finding child-rape sexy. It would also mean finding Humbert Humbert sexy. And that is a level of perversion probably beyond even Jeffrey Epstein.

            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/2025/12/iraq-venezuela-trump-oil-drugs/685342/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">There is a certain eerie familiarity to the Trump administration’s slow roll to war with Venezuela. There is the ominous military buildup, the shifting rationales, and even a shaky claim of “weapons of mass destruction,” thanks to the administration’s recent reclassification of fentanyl, to help justify its attacks.

The conflict with Venezuela will probably play out differently than the Iraq War did—perhaps better, perhaps worse. But the moral basis upon which it is being waged is most certainly worse.

The administration initially justified its campaign, which has already involved 28 known U.S. attacks against boats that officials have claimed were carrying illegal drugs, as a defensive war to stop the flow of drugs. “This mission defends our Homeland, removes narco-terrorists from our Hemisphere, and secures our Homeland from the drugs that are killing our people,” Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth wrote on X last month.

Given Venezuela’s slight role in the supply chain of illicit drugs to the United States, and President Donald Trump’s otherwise fairly lax approach to the narcotics trade—he has pardoned or granted clemency to more than 90 drug criminals across both terms—whispers began circulating recently that the true motive was pecuniary, that Trump was really interested in Venezuela’s oil. “This is a shakedown—a financial shakedown, being done primarily for profit,” one official told my colleagues Vivian Salama and Sarah Fitzpatrick last week.

Will Gottsegen: The new ‘weapon of mass destruction’

This secret motive didn’t stay secret very long. Last week the president told reporters that the U.S. had seized a “very large” oil tanker off the coast of Venezuela “for a very good reason.” Asked what would happen to the oil, he responded: “I assume we’re going to keep the oil.” Trump then demanded this week that Venezuela pay for the oil assets the country had apparently stolen from the U.S. Speaking to reporters, he framed the conflict as retribution: “They took our oil rights. We have a lot of oil there. As you know, they threw our companies out, and we want it back.” Trump has ordered a naval “blockade” aimed at Venezuela’s oil industry.

Homeland Security Adviser Stephen Miller has tried to blend Trump’s mob-like account with the supposed ideals and concerns that initially motivated this campaign, writing on X: “American sweat, ingenuity and toil created the oil industry in Venezuela. Its tyrannical expropriation was the largest recorded theft of American wealth and property. These pillaged assets were then used to fund terrorism and flood our streets with killers, mercenaries and drugs.”

More than 20 years ago, George W. Bush’s critics accused him of going to war in Iraq for the oil. But President Bush made it plain that this was not his objective. At the outset of the conflict, he called Iraq’s oil wells “a source of wealth that belongs to the Iraqi people,” and he never turned them over to American hands.

Trump did not oppose the Iraq War at the time, but he did present himself as a critic after it went south. His most consistent reason for his opposition was that America had failed to seize Iraq’s oil, despite the fact that doing so would have been a war crime.

In his first term in office, Trump repeatedly expressed his regret that the U.S. failed to use its interventions in Iraq and Libya to seize their oil reserves, and tried to use American troops in Iraq and Syria for this purpose. But like many of his first-term impulses, this one was dismissed and deterred by his subordinates for being impossibly unrealistic, immoral, or criminal. Trump’s second term has seen many of the president’s once-unimaginable demands transformed into official policy.

Vivian Salama and Sarah Fitzpatrick: Trump knows what he wants, just not how to get there

The fact that Trump wants to seize Venezuela’s oil wealth does not mean it will happen. Nor does it mean that this is the administration’s sole motive. The Washington Post reports that Miller’s support for the war evolved out of a desire to attack drug cartels in Mexico, and he seems to believe that war will make it easier for him to declare Venezuelan migrants enemy combatants and deport them.

Secretary of State Marco Rubio, whose thinking aligns with more traditional Republican foreign-policy goals, wants to depose Venezuela’s dictator, Nicolás Maduro. It is true that Maduro has crushed what remains of the country’s democracy and installed a kleptocratic leadership. But Trump’s plan to use war to seize Venezuelan wealth is incompatible with democratizing the country. Any Venezuelan government committed to transferring its national wealth to foreign hands will lose legitimacy immediately, and will succeed in holding power only through raw force.

Trump has long benefited from his contrast with the second Bush administration’s failed experiments with nation building. He has dismissed his Republican critics as neoconservatives, and some left-wing populists credit him for moving his party away from Bush-style interventionism.

Yet Trump’s saber-rattling against Venezuela confirms that his argument with neoconservatism was never about the hubris of exporting democracy or a faith in pacifistic leadership. Trump’s main complaint about Bush was that he squandered an opportunity to enrich the U.S. by caring too much about international law and the dignity of the Iraqi people. For all their arrogant blundering, neoconservatives were at least motivated by ideals about promoting American values around the world. Trump seems eager to replace this doctrine with an old and naked form of imperialism.</div>

            <h2>How to Treat Purveyors of Baseless Speculation</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2025-12-19</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/2025/12/conspiracy-rumors-brown-shooter-lost-credibility/685346/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">For three days before police identified the Portuguese man who apparently killed two Brown University undergraduates and an MIT professor, a certain squalid sector of social media was astir with one question: Where is Mustapha Kharbouch? Kharbouch, a Brown undergraduate and Palestinian activist, was floated as a culprit by @0hour1, an anonymous X account with 270,400 followers. Others claimed that Kharbouch was “allegedly, possibly … a suspect” (whatever that means), and amateur forensic podiatrists reported a “97.8% gait match” between Kharbouch and the killer. The Agence France-Presse has a roundup of prominent figures who amplified suspicion of Kharbouch, including the podcaster Tim Pool and the financier Bill Ackman. Brown took down, without explanation, webpages that mentioned Kharbouch, and some said that deletion looked awfully suspicious.

Where was he? Presumably he was busy interviewing libel lawyers, and calculating how much of his Brown tuition could be paid off by suing those who accused him of killing his classmates. Some of his tormentors have gone to their websites and taken down, without explanation, their accusations. Some might say that deletion also looks awfully suspicious, the evidence of a bad conscience and possibly good legal advice.

Xochitl Gonzalez: America is failing its children

Other speculation was less damaging, but still wrong. The Morning Meeting’s Mark Halperin relayed a rumor that the killer had targeted Ella Cook, a conservative student and one of the victims. And The Jerusalem Post indicated that Iran might have taken out the MIT physicist, Nuno Loureiro, although now it appears that that was a Portuguese-on-Portuguese murder without geopolitical significance.

The Brown and MIT shootings were unusual because so many days elapsed without any useful images or clues about the killer or his choice of victim. The desperation of the police came across unsettlingly in their press conferences. And just as starving castaways start nibbling on shoe leather, social media started giving credence to harmful nonsense; even journalists like Halperin reported speculation that they knew had little to support it. (“If I were editing The New York Times, I don’t think I’d put it in the paper,” he said, before airing the rumor and demonstrating the distinction between his own show and The New York Times.) The Jerusalem Post is a good example of media autophagy, the self-consumption of its own apparent speculation.

Hungry mouths demand feeding, and I suppose it is unreasonable to expect total abstention from speculation when there is no more nourishing substance on offer. But we were all adrift in the lifeboat together, and some started consuming their own piss sooner than others. The shootings were so obviously senseless—one theory is that the killer was angry at physics, the discipline from which he’d washed out decades ago, and shot a bunch of intro-to-economics students by accident—that the only lessons to be extracted from the experience are these incidental ones.

Who speculated? Who started the speculation? Who refrained from speculation, and who stayed silent even as the hunger for information became unbearable? Those who consumed all that speculative junk and liked it are beyond hope. Others, who are salvageable, might log off, take a walk, or otherwise forswear digital information. But that is the wrong approach.

Helen Lewis: MAGA influencers don’t understand what journalism is

It is better to keep score. Those who speculated wildly have earned eternal blocks from me on social media. To spread rumors without substantiation shows disregard for the object of those rumors, of course. Moreover, it shows indifference to the victims of the shootings. If you care about dead students and professors, you have to care about accurately, rather than indiscriminately, identifying those who killed them. Some speculated more directly than others. The right-wing activist Pamela Geller implied that Kharbouch was a “murdering Muslim.” Another right-wing activist, Laura Loomer, said Brown’s removal of Kharbouch’s webpages was part of “a massive coverup to protect the identity of the shooter.” Another right-wing activist, the assistant attorney general for civil rights, Harmeet Dhillon, merely called the scrubbing “concerning.” But they all bet some amount of credibility on the relevance of this student to the investigation. And it is important that because they lost that bet, they lose credibility along with it.

Keeping score also means rewarding those who said nothing when they knew nothing. (To my knowledge, no one knew anything. If someone wrote, three days ago, that the Brown massacre “has all the hallmarks of a Lusophone, plasma-physics-related homicide,” then all I can say is Tiro-te o chapéu—I doff my hat to you. Immediate follow.) Most established news organizations, including The New York Times, Fox News, and WPRI, seem to have followed this basic rule, and limited their coverage to relaying their own failure, along with everyone else’s, to come up with any leads. Sometimes eating nothing is the healthiest option. This week was not a bad one for mainstream media.</div>

A Wisconsin jury found state court Judge Hannah Dugan guilty of obstructing federal immigration enforcement on Thursday, delivering a victory to the Trump administration’s crusade against anyone—even judicial officers—who attempt to impede its mass deportation campaign. Dugan, a Milwaukee County Circuit Judge, helped a noncitizen evade ICE agents at the state courthouse by instructing him to exit the courtroom through a specific door. Agents apprehended him anyway, and prosecutors promptly charged Dugan with obstruction, a felony punishable by up to five years’ imprisonment.

On this week’s Slate Plus bonus episode of Amicus, co-hosts Dahlia Lithwick and Mark Joseph Stern discussed the jury’s verdict, and the dissonance of a legal regime in which the president can break the law with impunity while a judge faces prison for impeding an immigration arrest inside her own courtroom. A preview of their conversation, below, has been edited and condensed for clarity.

Dahlia Lithwick: Judge Dugan allegedly pointed an undocumented immigrant to a side door in her courtroom to evade ICE agents. And now she has been found guilty of a felony offense. This verdict is so depressing in so many ways. Can we count them?

Mark Joseph Stern: We are living in a world in which the Supreme Court has granted sweeping criminal immunity to presidents—specifically, to Donald Trump—for actions that they take that fall anywhere within the “outer perimeter” of their “official responsibilities.” SCOTUS simply made that rule up in Trump v. United States. Yet there is a real doctrine of judicial immunity that has deep roots in American law. It provides an absolute shield against prosecution of judges for all actions taken in their official capacity. That has long been understood to include how judges direct activities within their courtrooms. Now, remember what Dugan allegedly did: She directed a criminal defendant in her courtroom to leave through a certain door so ICE would not arrest him, thereby preventing her from continuing to adjudicate his case. The Trump administration argued that Dugan should not receive judicial immunity for this act. And U.S. District Judge Lynn Adelman agreed, paving the way for Thursday’s guilty verdict.

The idea that a judge can’t claim judicial immunity for the act of telling someone to leave through a certain door in her courtroom strikes me as absurd. Set aside professional penalties. How in the world can a judge face criminal prosecution for this conduct after Trump v. United States? The Supreme Court has now granted the president absolute immunity for ordering a sham investigation into a free and fair election in order to nullify valid votes and overturn the results. But Dugan can be prosecuted for this? I just can’t square those things.

I’m not saying that what Dugan did was unquestionably right or good. I am saying that when a judge in her robes, in her own courtroom, tells someone who is going to appear at her hearing to leave through a particular door, she is surely acting within the outer perimeter of her official duties. Certainly much more so than Trump was acting within the outer perimeter of his official duties when he attempted to secure himself another term by overturning the results of an election.

I think you’re making a subtle argument and it’s worth landing on it really squarely. It’s one thing to confer maximalist, seemingly boundless authority on the executive branch and on the president that, by definition, circumscribes the judicial role. But to aggressively chip away, cut away, minimize, and cabin the powers of the judiciary at the same time? That’s really salt in the wound, and a threat to an independent judiciary.

Let’s be clear: This is an effort to chill the conduct of judges, especially state court judges, who believe they should decide the case before them without worrying that ICE agents are going to ambush plaintiffs or defendants or witnesses and thwart their effort to carry out justice. That is what happened here. That is what is happening in many states around the country. Some, like New York, have tried to block ICE agents from going into state courthouses. This was Judge Dugan doing much the same thing; trying to contend with the fact that ICE was about to arrest someone who was due to appear before her.

I think the verdict shows a real failure of the jury to understand how vindictive and partisan this prosecution was, and to see the deeper issues lurking here. It’s awful that the U.S. attorney brought this case in the first place. I think the prosecutors who worked on this case should be ashamed of themselves. I guess my one consolation is that Judge Adelman is known to be a very lenient sentencer. If Dugan’s conviction is upheld on appeal, I think it’s unlikely that he’ll give her any term of confinement behind bars. She has no criminal record and there are no other factors that would call for a higher sentence. Adelman might impose house arrest, but probation seems more likely.

When Robert F. Kennedy Jr. convened a panel on Monday to discuss “chronic Lyme,” many leading researchers of the disease were genuinely excited. Kennedy’s Department of Health and Human Services promised to allocate more resources to understanding the disease. There was hope, among experts, that this would mean an important new chapter for Lyme research.

But there’s a problem: Kennedy is a conspiracy theorist with seemingly little understanding of how modern science works. It didn’t emerge in Monday’s roundtable, but Kennedy, for example, once claimed Lyme disease was developed by the U.S. military as a bioweapon in the ’70s. He still maintains that the medical community has “gaslit” the public over Lyme and even asserted, without evidence, that during the Biden years, there were top officials within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services who, due to political motivations, were “saying Lyme disease did not exist.”

This is not an ideal mindset to bring to any medical topic, but it’s particularly troubling for Lyme, given that it is already one of the most controversial diseases.

Active Lyme disease, identified in the 1970s, is not a particularly mysterious illness. The tick bite that transfers the bacteria typically causes an easily identifiable bullseye rash; once spotted, symptoms, which can include fever, headaches, stiffness, and fatigue, can be resolved with a round of antibiotics. The treatment of active Lyme is fairly straightforward. But the aftermath of active Lyme remains a deeply unsettled area of science. A subset of Lyme patients go on to complain of arthritis-like joint pain, fatigue, and neurological issues for years afterward. For a smaller population, the symptoms become debilitating. Some patients grow desperate and even suicidal.

Until recently, many mainstream medical professionals disputed the idea of “chronic Lyme” altogether, insisting that Lyme was done once it was treated with antibiotics. Any complaints the patients had afterward, they argued, likely resulted from other conditions or from psychiatric disorders, which can indeed cause severe physical symptoms. But patients don’t like being told something is all in their head, particularly when their lives are falling apart over a maddeningly persistent illness. As a result, a “Lyme community” began to form of patients who felt forced to become their own champions and validate one another’s suffering. Many looked for answers outside conventional medicine.

The rush of pseudoscientists, grifters, wellness influencers, and celebrity advocates into the space only made the chronic Lyme debate more fraught. Even the term “chronic Lyme” was, and is, highly charged: In medical literature, doctors call it Post-Treatment Lyme Disease Syndrome, in part to clarify that they are not referring to a continuous, chronic infection with the bacteria but only to a constellation of symptoms that develop and linger after confirmed bouts of Lyme disease. The people this term doesn’t include are those—often self-diagnosed laypeople or the patients of anti-scientific practitioners—who believe that they have insidious Lyme infections missed by blood tests and persistent beyond any normal antibiotic treatment. (The research does not show any evidence for a chronic Lyme infection, experts said.) These patients never developed the rash or had any other concrete evidence of Lyme infection. These are the cases that caused many in the mainstream medical community to dismiss “chronic Lyme” as nonsense.

But mainstream scientists weren’t entirely ignoring the possibility of both undetectable and chronic Lyme, as much as Kennedy may insist otherwise. Many researchers agreed there was a need for better testing and that it was possible that real Lyme sufferers were going undiagnosed. And even in the earliest Lyme studies, experts said, the National Institutes of Health had attempted to suss out longer-term damage. The problem, said Dr. Brian Fallon, the director of the Lyme and Tick-Borne Diseases Research Center at Columbia University, was that most Lyme research dealt primarily with “well-defined” patients—those with telltale rashes and active infection that showed on blood tests—in order to have clean, careful studies. Those patients were those with the easiest cases, with easy diagnostics and prompt treatment. The potentially messier cases, without rashes, or with long periods of infection without treatment, were not taken into account. The pace of the research moved relatively slowly, given that Lyme was never such an urgent problem. It is not deadly or contagious like Ebola or AIDS. For many patients, it’s more like a temporary inconvenience.

But two things changed. First, climate change has made Lyme an increasingly visible and pressing issue. As the tick population explodes across North America, Lyme has become a virtually inescapable threat in the Northeast and parts of the Midwest. Second, a global pandemic struck. In its aftermath, research institutions turned their resources to questions about COVID’s long-term effects. As they did, they began to bring those same questions to other infectious diseases that might result in chronic conditions.

“It shouldn’t come as any surprise to the world right now that infections can cause chronic problems, because of what we have learned from long COVID,” Fallon said. “I think it’s helped tremendously in changing the conversation. … There’s a great deal of interest in looking at something that’s been ignored.”

It is now a potent moment for Lyme research. If scientists can get the funding and resources they need to develop better diagnostics and unlock the mechanism that explains what is making chronic Lyme patients sick, it could bring profound relief to hundreds of thousands of Americans, allowing them to get the care they need. But a large part of pursuing a major medical breakthrough is separating science from pseudoscience in order to allow the scientific process to proceed with its dispassionate methods. And Kennedy has shown that he is incapable of that—and is steering his HHS accordingly.

There are urgent reasons, beyond the success of future research, for the leading medical institutions in the country to try to purge the lingering anti-scientific elements in the Lyme conversation: They may actually put patients’ health at risk. When confusion meets desperation, as it does when the Centers for Disease Control and the National Institutes of Health cannot provide any clarity, patients and doctors may seek out unconventional answers.

“A lot of these patients undergo bizarre, unapproved therapies, like extended intravenous antibiotic therapies, for months or even years,” Dr. Durland Fish, the chief executive officer of the American Lyme Disease Foundation, told Slate. “A lot of them are bogus.”

These treatments, Fish said, can be expensive, as they usually aren’t covered by insurance. And they can be deeply dispiriting when they don’t work. Some patients, he said, can become depressed and even suicidal.

And perhaps even more worryingly, if a patient becomes convinced they have chronic Lyme based on an influencer’s videos, they may be diverted from identifying something else. Part of the reason chronic Lyme has always been controversial is that its symptoms are so nonspecific. Fatigue, brain fog, headaches, and joint pain can be caused by anemia, sleep disorders, mental illnesses, arthritis, multiple sclerosis, lupus, ALS, fibromyalgia, cancer, and many other conditions.

“From my perspective, I think the misdiagnosis and mistreatment is a bigger problem than the actual Lyme disease,” he said.

Now, as chronic Lyme emerges from its era of hazy theories and pseudoscience, it continues to be tainted with its previous associations. As an example, New Jersey Rep. Chris Smith, who attended Monday’s hearing, slipped a provision in the National Defense Authorization Act, which passed Wednesday, requiring the Government Accountability Office to investigate whether Lyme disease was bioengineered by the U.S. military. (Lyme disease, it should be noted, predates the United States itself by millennia.) During Monday’s hearing, he complained that mainstream news media, including the Washington Post, had portrayed him and his allies “like we have a tinfoil hat on our heads.” Smith is a Republican, but conspiratorial thinking on Lyme is a bipartisan problem.

And few are as damaging to chronic Lyme’s reputation among skeptics as Kennedy himself. As head of HHS, Kennedy has baselessly attributed deaths to the COVID vaccine, connected both Tylenol and circumcision to autism, and linked SSRIs to mass shootings. In one throwaway comment in the hearing, he claimed that the antiretroviral drug developed during the AIDS epidemic under Anthony Fauci’s NIH killed more people than AIDS itself.

The panel he convened was similarly questionable. Participants were largely not the leading experts in Lyme research but instead patients, medical technology business owners, politicians, and people with out-there theories about the disease. One person claimed there was a connection between Lyme disease and autism—something no mainstream researcher seems to find credible. Another person, who is a patient and an HHS official, asserted that had she followed standard medical Lyme treatments, “I would be dead today.” Lyme disease is not a fatal disease.

Still, Fish, like the other experts, said that Kennedy’s NIH putting more resources into understanding chronic Lyme could be extremely helpful for the thousands of Americans struggling with mysterious symptoms. These patients, he said, need answers and better diagnostic tools.

“These patients have serious illnesses, and I don’t blame them for raising hell about the situation,” he said.

Lyme is a disease that makes sense as a target for Kennedy, as obsessing over chronic illnesses is a core tenet of the “Make America Healthy Again” movement. Kennedy has said one of his sons developed Bell’s palsy from Lyme and that one son developed severe, debilitating chronic Lyme. Kennedy is also, fittingly for his family’s reputation for being full of robust outdoorsmen, a big proponent of getting outside into the woods—advice being made dangerous by the ticks. He noted the “spiritual” value of the outdoors in his address Monday.

Lyme also makes some sense as a target for the moment, when there is no epidemiological crisis such as SARS or COVID or AIDS consuming all the oxygen in the conversation. Leading experts in Lyme say people are beginning to understand the “insidious epidemic” of Lyme, as Dr. John Aucott, the director of the Johns Hopkins Lyme Disease Clinical Research Center, put it. He and Fallon expressed the need not just for studies and testing but an entire built-out academic infrastructure around it. Right now, most academic programs are struggling under federal budget cuts; Lyme research is one area where Kennedy’s personal interest may be of use.

For countless Americans, this could be great news. Aucott noted that he watched AIDS go from a death sentence to a manageable condition—proof that painstaking, rigorous research can revolutionize the understanding and treatment of a new disease. Today, he said, some of his Lyme patients are sicker than the AIDS patients were at the end of his time treating them.

Hopefully, Kennedy’s anti-science approach will not impede the evidence-based Lyme research that comes. His sloppiness, as when he repeatedly during panel discussions conflated Lyme disease and Post-Treatment Lyme Disease Syndrome, may not carry through to actual policy. And in at least one way, experts gave Kennedy credit on something else: He’s right, they said, that most people are not just sick from psychosomatic causes. “These are complex illnesses we’re just starting to understand,” Aucott said. “They’ve got a hard-to-explain illness. That doesn’t mean it’s just in their heads.”

But when diseases are particularly complex, and when the medical understanding of a topic shifts rapidly, it’s particularly damaging to have a man who consistently undermines the mainstream scientific community as the face of its public health response. The public needs clarity from its government, not just disruption. In this case, clarity doesn’t just mean validating suffering patients’ frustrations. It means acknowledging the limits of our knowledge while having an open mind—and focusing not on heated feelings but on the scientific process.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">hands on Infinite Machine, a New York-based electric vehicle startup, began with a stolen Vespa.

Eddie Cohen, president and co-founder of the company, told The Register that he and his brother Joseph were living together during the COVID outbreak.

&quot;His Vespa had gotten stolen and we just kinda had this crazy idea … if we were to design one for the future that was all-electric, had the best technology, what would it look like? What would it feel like?&quot; Cohen explained.

As I stood beside P1, a $10,000 electric seated scooter, and Olto, a $3,495 bike-lane legal class 2 e-bike, that question had been answered. The brothers&#39; company started shipping the P1 to customers in October and expects to deliver Olto in early 2026.

&quot;We just started dabbling and we came up with P1, you know, just a sketch,&quot; said Cohen, who had a background in product design. &quot;And then, over the subsequent two or three years, we just continued to noodle on it. Nights and weekends, we both had other jobs.&quot;

In January, 2024, he said, Infinite Machines became their full-time job. He and his brother assembled a team and began moving from sketch to actual product.

&quot;So P1 is a plated, M-class vehicle,&quot; said Cohen, meaning drivers should be licensed for motorcycles unless they only use it in Mode 1, where speed is capped at 30 mph.

&quot;It goes 65 miles an hour, 60-mile range. The battery is in the floor. It fits two people. It has a full touchscreen – 8.5&quot; display – that has what we call Phone Connect. So it connects to your iPhone, you get Maps. Music, etc. It has whisper-quiet acceleration. It&#39;s kind of like riding a Tesla for the first time, but it&#39;s even more surreal because it&#39;s silent.&quot;

The P1, said Cohen, was designed from scratch. &quot;All of the componentry is custom-toolled and developed. That&#39;s not a trivial thing.&quot;

He pointed to the fender for example. It&#39;s not off the shelf.

&quot;We designed it,&quot; he said. &quot;We made the tooling. We made the molds, and made it so that the engineering works just because we actually care about the details.&quot;

It&#39;s an opinionated design. The use of anodized aluminum and steel makes comparisons with the Tesla Cybertruck unavoidable. But the DMC DeLorean is an equally apt comparison, perhaps more so given the challenging nature of startup vehicle companies.

&quot;We were inspired by the Cybertruck,&quot; said Cohen, &quot;but we didn&#39;t set out to design the Cybertruck of scooters. We used it as one reference point in a lineage of vehicles, like Marcelo Gandini and the Lancias back in the day. The Diablo, the Countach, the DeLorean, like these are all references that we love.&quot;

Cohen added that the plan is to explore future colors, and variants for specific markets like police and other first responders.

Your correspondent had the opportunity to take the P1 for a spin in San Francisco and it was a thrill – it&#39;s fun, fast, and handles well. I&#39;m not by nature a rider of scooters or motorcycles, though I&#39;ve enjoyed the lazy ease of electric bikes. Were I a younger man, more willing to mix it up among motorists without the protection of an automotive frame, airbags, and a seatbelt, I&#39;d be looking seriously at the P1 or the more modest Olto for urban transportation.

The P1 includes just the right number of physical buttons, with well-conceived software and hardware. It features secure storage, front and rear cameras, phone-based keyless access, and GPS location tracking, among other niceties. It relies on a Linux fork called IMOS, Infinite Machine OS.

Presently, there&#39;s no AI on-board – which this reporter considers a selling point. Cohen recounted how someone had asked the company&#39;s head of systems what AI is being explored. &quot;He kind of was like, &#39;Look, they&#39;re expensive, right? You put a Nvidia chip on here and you put a camera and it&#39;s expensive. It adds to the [bill-of-materials] cost. And it&#39;s not obvious that there is value there.&quot;

He added however that the company has ideas for ways AI might be useful to improve the safety of two-wheeled vehicles.

Software applications for the vehicles will be developed in time. Cohen said that Infinite Machine does gather data to understand how people are using its vehicles, but does so in a way that respects privacy.

&quot;So we don&#39;t know anything about the individual rider and we have anonymized everything,&quot; he said. &quot;We care about rider privacy. We also care about, like, you buy this vehicle, it&#39;s just gonna work. Like you don&#39;t have to pay a subscription ever. It&#39;s just gonna work all the time and it&#39;s your vehicle. But we do anonymize and track usage.&quot;

Cohen said he expects the target market in the US will be those who appreciate technology and design. &quot;They want something that&#39;s new and they want the best,&quot; he said.

&quot;In 2025, the ultimate luxury is really time and freedom to do what you want. And P1 saves you time. It&#39;s the fastest and best way to get around any city like in San Francisco, this thing is liberating. It&#39;s amazing. It handles the hills totally well. You can park it anywhere. You don&#39;t have to spend 30 minutes looking for a spot. You get to live life on your own terms.&quot;

Cohen expects the Olto will have broader appeal.

&quot;For Olto, I think it&#39;s for everyone,&quot; he said &quot;I think it&#39;s the mom in Brooklyn dropping her kids to school. I think it&#39;s the person that is single and wants to commute to work. I think it&#39;s the SoCal kid that&#39;s going to school. This is an accessible vehicle. It&#39;s very easy to ride, very approachable, and affordable.&quot; ®

            <h2>ATM jackpotting gang accused of unleashing Ploutus malware across US</h2>
            <p><strong>The Register | 2025-12-19</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2025/12/19/tren_de_aragua_atm/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">A Venezuelan gang described by US officials as &quot;a ruthless terrorist organization&quot; faces charges over alleged deployment of malware on ATMs across the country, illegally siphoning millions of dollars.

Two indictments were returned in Nebraska, collectively charging 54 alleged members of the Tren de Aragua (TdA) gang in connection with a spate of ATM jackpotting attacks.

The gang allegedly deployed a variant of Ploutus malware on ATMs across the US. Court documents assert that TdA members would travel in groups and compromise ATMs managed by certain banks and credit unions.

The alleged gang members would inspect each ATM for external security features before opening the machine&#39;s door, checking for alarms being triggered or law enforcement rushing to the scene.

Once they confirmed a machine could be safely tampered with, the suspects would either remove the ATM&#39;s hard drive and install the Ploutus variant before reinstalling it, or in some cases simply replace the hard drive with one that already had Ploutus installed. Other instances saw the malware deployed using external thumb drives.

Thought to be first observed in Mexico back in 2013, Ploutus malware targets the cash-dispensing module of ATMs, allowing attackers to issue commands that force the machine to spurt out bills.

According to data shared by the Justice Department, ATM jackpotting attacks have seen more than $40 million stolen via physical device tampering and malware deployment since 2020. It did not share specific figures about how much of that could be attributed to TdA.

&quot;Tren de Aragua is not just a criminal gang; they are a ruthless terrorist organization that preys on communities, spreads fear, and bankrolls violence across borders,&quot; said Mark Zito, special agent in charge at HSI Kansas City.

&quot;HSI and our law enforcement partners will track you down, break up your networks, and ensure you never find safe harbor in the United States. Our mission is to protect American families from predators who think they can operate with impunity. We will not tolerate foreign terrorists stealing from our citizens and threatening our homeland. Our communities are safer today because of the relentless work of this team, and we are just getting started.&quot;

Across the various indictments against alleged TdA members in Nebraska over the past year are additional charges related to assault, money laundering, and sex trafficking of minors.

The announcement comes as the US announces a broader crackdown on the Venezuelan gang, with a slew of indictments across various states charging hundreds of alleged members since January.

The DOJ in Washington also unsealed indictments on Thursday related to other violent crimes committed by more than 70 alleged members, including murder, kidnapping, and drug trafficking.

Two of the group&#39;s suspected leaders were indicted in Colorado on various charges, including RICO offenses, while the alleged mastermind and co-leader of TdA, Hector Rusthenford Guerrero Flores, was charged in New York.

Flores remains at large, although there is a $5 million bounty on his head. The co-leader of TdA escaped from Venezuela&#39;s Tocorón prison in 2012, allegedly with the help of Jimena Romina Araya Navarro – another TdA leader – before being sent back in 2013.

Tocorón was notoriously lawless for years, but during the early 2000s, TdA began to assemble, and by the following decade, it assumed total control of the prison, infamously building amenities such as the Tokio nightclub, a zoo, a swimming pool, and more.

In 2023, Venezuelan authorities regained control of the facility in an operation that saw 11,000 officers storm the grounds, but Flores and his associates reportedly escaped days before.

In other states, New Mexico charged 11 alleged members over violent and armed crimes, and in Texas, more suspected high-ranking members and those in leadership roles were charged with cocaine trafficking, murder, and extortion.

The renewed focus on tackling TdA began in February when Attorney General Pamela Bondi expanded the remit of Joint Task Force Vulcan. Created in 2019, it was originally tasked with bringing down MS-13 gang members, but is now also responsible for handling TdA.

&quot;Immediately upon taking office, I directed the Department of Justice to fiercely pursue the total elimination of cartels and transnational criminal organizations,&quot; said Bondi.

&quot;This latest multi-state series of charges underscores the Trump Administration&#39;s unwavering commitment to restoring public safety, dismantling violent trafficking networks, and ridding our country of Tren de Aragua terrorists.&quot; ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The US Department of Energy (DOE) has a Christmas gift for the AI industry in the shape of agreements for collaboration in the Trump administration&#39;s Genesis Mission, which aims to use AI to drive scientific discoveries.

On Thursday, the DOE said it had signed agreements with 24 organizations interested in working to advance the Genesis project.

The list includes the usual AI ecosystem suspects, with developers such as OpenAI, Anthropic, and xAI; major cloud operators AWS, Google, Microsoft, and Oracle; server makers Dell and HPE; chip suppliers AMD, Intel, and Nvidia; plus everyone&#39;s favorite Bond villain organization, Palantir.

However, the agreements are not contracts to provide services as such, but are described by the DOE as Memorandums of Understanding (MOUs) with organizations that have either expressed interest in response to a Request for Information (RFI), or which already have active projects with DOE and its National Laboratories for activities related to the Genesis Mission.

&quot;These agreements help advance President Trump&#39;s Executive Order to build the national AI platform for scientific discovery and uplift the entire US R&D ecosystem,&quot; said Genesis Mission director and DOE Under Secretary for Science Dr Darío Gil.

The Genesis project was kick-started just last month via an executive order issued by President Trump. It aims to create an integrated Science and Security Platform for the US by pulling together supercomputers and other resources across the DOE&#39;s 17 National Laboratories and supplementing this with input from industry and academia.

Earlier this month, the agency announced $320 million in funding for four initiatives as part of the project, including the American Science Cloud (AmSC) as the infrastructure platform for Genesis, the Transformational AI Models Consortium (ModCon) to work on model development, and various projects to curate existing datasets and develop AI models validated for scientific applications.

So-called neocloud firm CoreWeave is also among the signatories with the DOE, and the rent-a-GPU biz said that it plans to make its purpose-built AI cloud platform available to support advanced scientific workloads.

CoreWeave chief exec Michael Intrator said Genesis &quot;represents a vital national commitment to accelerating scientific discovery and reaffirming America&#39;s leadership in research and innovation.&quot;

Consultants McKinsey & Company recently opined that neoclouds such as CoreWeave needed to adapt their business model to offering services built on their AI infrastructure rather than just renting GPU time, and Genesis may prove just such an opportunity.

Google&#39;s DeepMind subsidiary is set to make available its frontier AI for Science models and agentic tools to scientists at the DOE National Laboratories, starting with AI co-scientist on Google Cloud, it declared.

This it described as a &quot;multi-agent virtual scientific collaborator built on Gemini,&quot; which has been trained using Google&#39;s cloud-based TPU AI chips.

OpenAI said that the agreement builds on its existing work with DOE&#39;s National Laboratories, and creates a path for the parties to discuss and develop potential follow-on agreements as specific projects take shape.

&quot;We&#39;re excited to collaborate with the Department of Energy and contribute to the Genesis Mission. When frontier AI meets the expertise of the national labs, it opens up new ways to explore ideas, test them faster, and accelerate scientific progress,&quot; said Kevin Weil, OpenAI VP for Science. ®

Congress passed energy provisions in the annual defense bill that could help spur the development of advanced nuclear reactors.﻿

President Trump signed the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal Year 2026 Thursday with measures that further the bipartisan push for next-generation nuclear power plants.

The Trump administration has embraced the technology as a new energy source for data centers demanding greater amounts of electricity for AI. Many Democrats, meanwhile, have championed smaller and ostensibly cheaper and easier-to-build nuclear reactors as a carbon pollution-free energy source that can help fight climate change. The US military has also been interested in microreactors to power off-grid operations

The defense bill, which Congress passed earlier this week, includes two amendments that advocates for commercial nuclear energy are celebrating. The International Nuclear Energy Act establishes working groups and boosts funding and interagency cooperation on the development and export of US nuclear technologies. The NDAA also reauthorizes the US International Development Finance Corporation, a finance institution that’s expected to invest in nuclear power plant and uranium fuel projects.

Those are “big wins” that make nuclear exports more attractive in the global market, Rowen Price, senior policy advisor for nuclear energy at center-left think tank Third Way, says in an email to The Verge.

The bill also directs the Department of Defense to create an executive agent role “for installation and operational nuclear energy.”

Let’s face it, it’s easy to fixate on the big gifts that crowd around the Christmas tree. However, we’d argue that the true treasures are the small, useful, and thoughtful gifts tucked within stockings. That’s why, for this guide, we’ve pooled together a bunch of tried-and-tested gadgets and goods to help bolster someone’s everyday carry or, at the very least, provide them with something that comes in clutch every once in a while. It certainly isn’t about gag gifts and cheap trinkets.

The good news is that many of the items we’ve highlighted in our guides to the best gifts under $25, best gifts under $50, and best gifts under $100 also meet the criteria for a good stocking stuffer, as most of them can easily fit in a bag and improve your daily routine. This includes a location tracker for keeping tabs on your belongings, a pocket-friendly set of wireless earbuds, and a handy multitool for making small repairs around the house, all of which can be found below.

AirTags can function as a second set of eyes for iPhone owners, allowing you to keep tabs on everything from your car keys to your backpack. That’s because the ultra wideband location trackers tap into Apple’s extensive Find My network, which allows for impressively precise tracking and lets users share the tracker with up to five other people for even greater peace of mind.

Most people don’t want to wrangle cables… and who can blame them? Not us, which is why several folks at The Verge own Baseus’ handy, retractable USB-C option. The Free2Pull comes in two sizes, each of which conveniently pulls the excess cable into a small puck that’s far tidier and easier to manage than a loose cord.

This Landmark Project keychain can add a bit of color and personality to an otherwise vanilla set of keys. The retro-inspired doohickey features a glossy emboss finish and harkens back to classic motel tags, while reminding you to respect the great outdoors. It’s also made of durable ABS plastic and features metal hardware, so it should withstand miles upon miles of abuse.

Anker’s Nano Travel Adapter is a versatile charger for globe-trotters. It features four plug types, providing compatibility in over 200 countries, along with an AC connector, two USB-A ports, and two USB-C ports. The adapter is also relatively tiny — each plug type either extends / retracts or folds up — so it’s easy to slot into your bag.

Powerful power banks don’t have to be cumbersome. Iniu’s 10,000mAh P50 is about as thick as a deck of cards, but features 45W charging speeds, two USB-C ports, and one USB-A port. Its braided lanyard also doubles as a USB-C cable, providing everything you need to keep all of your electronics fully juiced on the go.

Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 breaks the mold of classic RPGs. The story is just as grandiose and gripping as the best Final Fantasy games, but by allowing you to dodge and parry every enemy attack, it flips more traditional turn-based combat on its head. Then there’s the score and visually striking world, both of which are just as refreshing to behold.

The Notes app is great, but sometimes pen and paper are where it’s at. Field Notes are small enough to fit in your pocket or a small bag, yet spacious enough to house all your big ideas and errant thoughts. The “Flora” Edition can even add a much-needed pop of color to any desk setup.

The original LifeStraw was designed for those heading into the backcountry. The new LifeStraw Sip? Not so much. The reusable steel straw is geared more toward travelers than outdoor enthusiasts, though fortunately it still manages to remove about 99.99 percent of microplastics, bacteria, and parasites from your drinking water.

Crumbs don’t stand a chance on your keyboard with OXO’s laptop cleaner. The double-sided tool has a retractable soft brush that gets into tiny crevices to sweep away dust, and the microfiber pad can remove fingerprints and smudges on screens. I’ve been using one for the past few years, and it’s great for quickly tidying up after a long day of clacking away.

Leatherman’s Skeletool CX comes with a 25-year warranty and all the basics you need for everyday use. The convenient multitool conceals a sturdy steel blade, a pair of pliers, and a large bit driver within its compact build, which easily slides into your pocket. It’s the kind of gadget that proves you don’t need every tool under the sun just to get the job done.

CMF’s higher-end earbuds offer a lot for the price, including active noise cancellation and a transparency mode that should keep you aware of your surroundings. The charging case also has a smart dial that lets you adjust the volume and switch between noise modes, while multipoint support means the Buds Pro 2 can connect to two devices simultaneously.

Donkey Kong Bananza for the Nintendo Switch 2 is a bona fide system seller. Made by the same team behind Super Mario Odyssey, it delivers satisfying punch action and environmental destruction. If you want a game where you can — if you’ll excuse the pun — go ape shit, then Bananza is for you.

The Amazon Smart Plug is a simple and inexpensive way to automate gadgets around your home. For instance, you can instruct Alexa to turn on a lamp that’s connected to the plug or control it via the Alexa app — no smart home hub required. The plug is compatible with most devices with an on / off switch, including fans, coffee makers, and other common household devices. It’s also great for controlling holiday lights.

Anker’s 3-in-1 charger features a trifold design, making it easy to fold down and throw in a bag. Its main wireless pad supplies up to 15W of power to your phone, while the other two are suitable for charging a smartwatch and a pair of wireless earbuds. Your purchase comes with a 40W adapter and 5-foot USB-C cable, too, giving you everything you need to start charging.

If your giftee ever had a soft spot for Nintendo’s Game Boy Advance SP, the RG 34XXSP won’t disappoint. Anbernic’s newer handheld emulator sports a classic clamshell design with a 3.4-inch 720p IPS display, as well as dual joysticks, four shoulder buttons, and a 3:2 aspect ratio that’s ideal for retro titles like Golden Sun and The Legend of Zelda: The Minish Cap.

Instead of sifting through a rat’s nest of cables, Anker’s dual-headed USB-C cable makes it easier to travel light. Thanks to its 2-in-1 design, you can charge two devices simultaneously — like a laptop and smartphone — with a peak power output of 140W. You don’t have to worry about the cable fraying, either, as it’s made from a durable braided nylon and has been tested to survive more than 10,000 bends.

There are few better ways to pass the time than getting lost in a good book (I’m reading Thomas Pynchon’s new Shadow Ticket). The latest base-model Kindle is our favorite cheap ebook reader, with a sharp 6-inch display, an adjustable frontlight, and a battery that lasts up to six weeks. And at just 158 grams, its lightweight design makes it easy to carry and hold for extended reading sessions.

The AirFly Pro 2 can amp up the sound quality of in-flight entertainment, making it a handy tool for frequent travelers. The long-lasting Bluetooth adapter can sync with two pairs of wireless earbuds or headphones at once, allowing you and a partner to share a movie, a podcast, or music without relying on the subpar earbuds most airlines provide.

Between the noise of airport terminals and snoring seat companions, traveling can be loud. Loop’s reusable Quiet 2 deliver 24 decibels of noise reduction, so you can snooze even when the person next to you is watching a movie at full volume. They’re made from a light, flexible silicone and come with four ear tip sizes, including an extra-small option.

The allure of Ugreen’s 65W Nexode charger is simple: It features a built-in retractable USB-C cable, so you don’t need an extra accessory to charge your gadgets. The cable extends to over 2 feet and securely locks at any length. It also features additional USB-C and USB-A ports, allowing you to charge three devices simultaneously.

With the film adaptation of Project Hail Mary just around the corner, now’s a great time to catch up on the book from The Martian author Andy Weir. The space odyssey chronicles one man’s mission to save the Earth; however, in doing so, it also explores the nature of sacrifice, friendship, and particle physics. Lots and lots of particle physics.

The MX Anywhere 3S is a compact, do-everything mouse that travels well. It offers 8K DPI tracking, so movements cover big distances, and it works on glass. The MagSpeed wheel can rip through long docs or switch to precise ratchets. It can pair with up to three devices over Bluetooth, works with both macOS and Windows, and offers up to 70 days of battery life.

This single-use camera from Kodak comes preloaded with 27 exposures of Tri-X 400, a gorgeous, grainy black-and-white film. It sports a 30mm f/10 plastic lens that churns out decently sharp images, plus a built-in flash that you can turn on and off via a button on the front. Like most single-use cameras, this one has a lens with a fixed focus range (about 3 feet to infinity) and shutter speed of 1/125 second.

Good, screen-free entertainment can be hard to come by for kids — which is where the latest Yoto Mini comes in. The travel-friendly audio gadget features a clock, an alarm, white noise, and a night light; however, its real selling point is that you can use it to play music and tell stories via a robust collection of more than 1,000 cards.

Who needs magnets when you have suction cups? Octobuddy’s cheap silicone mount works with most phones to provide hands-free flexibility whenever necessary. It features 24 single-sided cups, which allow you to stick your phone to a mirror, window, or any other surface you think will provide that perfect TikTok angle.

The Lego Animal Crossing Stargazing with Celeste set lets fans bring Animal Crossing into the real world. With just 78 pieces, you can build a peaceful outdoor scene featuring Celeste, the astronomy-loving owl. It also connects to other Animal Crossing playsets, if your giftee wants to expand on it.

This past year might not have been as life-shattering for most as 2020, but we’d argue life doesn’t have to be pure chaos for a stress ball to come in handy. The NeeDoh Groovy Glob, like all of Schylling’s colorful dough-filled shapes, makes for an inexpensive release that can be squeezed, squashed, and pulled to your heart’s content.

Bluetooth earbuds are all the rage, but you’d be surprised how often a wired pair comes in handy. Apple’s EarPods have a surprisingly good microphone, never need to be charged, and should work with all your USB-C devices. An inline controller on the earbuds’ cable lets you change your volume and pause or skip tracks.

Glocusent’s Bookmark Style Reading Light is the perfect gift for those who burn the midnight oil reading. The clip-on USB light offers a lightweight design and multiple brightness levels, providing a soft, warm glow that’s dim enough that it won’t disturb anyone else trying to get some shut-eye nearby.

You’ve heard of procedurally generated video games, but how about procedurally generated paper dungeon crawlers? Each 60-page Dungeon Notebook is completely unique and requires nothing other than a six-sided die and a pencil, which give you the means to navigate a variety of floors filled with coins, four-legged baddies, and hearts.

Holiday meals can leave you with a full belly and a foul-smelling fridge, which is where the Fun Guy comes in. The playful odor absorber can add a whimsical touch to your kitchen while serving a practical need. Just pop the mushroom top and load the smiley, spore-tacular container with baking soda to keep unwanted odors at bay.

Sucker Punch’s follow-up to Ghost of Tsushima is everything you could want in a sequel. The open-world revenge epic brims with fluid combat and a host of welcome narrative twists, all set against the gorgeous backdrop of Japan’s Edo period. It’s precisely the type of game photo modes were made for, even if you never use them.

Part wall wart, part magnetic wireless charger, Twelve South’s StandBy-ready PowerBug is about as unique as chargers come. The simple contraption can top off both MagSafe and Qi2-compatible devices — including the latest Google Pixel models — while simultaneously supplying 35W charging speeds to a second gadget via USB-C.

A swivelable spork might not be what your giftee had in mind for the next addition to their keychain, but hear us out: they’ll no longer have to ask for disposable cutlery, and they’ll never be without a dignified way to munch on the go. It’s also, you know, good for the environment.

Idlewild’s slim ballpoint pens look as good as they write. Each features a scratch-proof barrel, black ink, and a colorful, two-tone design, which makes them a lively piece of desk decor and the perfect instrument for jotting down thoughts in your favorite notebook. See? Who needs ChatGPT, anyway?

Everybody forgets to bring their charging cable with them from time to time, but it’s a lot harder to do with Nomad’s ChargeKey. The 6-inch zinc cable comes attached to a loop, which is easy to affix to the same ring as your keys. It even supports up to 240W of power and 10Gbps data transfer speeds, despite its short stature.

Scissors are overrated. Slice’s retractable box cutter has been a mainstay in our gift guides for years, primarily because the finger-friendly ceramic blade is great for tearing through packing tape and cutting plastic wrapping. The comfy tool also features a sturdy, reinforced nylon handle and a hooked design that makes it easy to stow when not in use.

Keychains make for a great gift, even if we do live in an age when keys themselves are becoming a bit of a novelty. Veraloop’s 7-inch Colorblock is a sturdy two-tone option made from deadstock and polyester, one that easily attaches to your purse, pouch, or other bags via the included carabiner.

Do you ever wish you could turn on your coffee maker or hit the light switch without getting up? The SwitchBot Bot lets you do that. All you need to do is stick the inexpensive contraption on a standard button or rocker switch, which will allow you to control or schedule your pet feeder, garage door, and a wide range of other devices from your smartphone.

Anker’s compact Prime Power Bank is a wall charger that doubles as a portable battery, delivering a total output of up to 65W through its two USB-C ports. At home, you can leave it plugged in like a standard wall charger. Hit the road, though, and the 9,600mAh battery can simultaneously power your phone and laptop or other gadgets.

The Fanttik X9 Pro can inflate a car tire in under a minute, making routine maintenance fast and easy. There are four one-click presets for cars, motorcycles, bikes, and balls, along with a manual mode that reaches a maximum pressure of 150 PSI. A flexible hose makes it easy to reach into tight spaces, and the battery lasts for up to 23 minutes without shutting off.

Metroid Prime 4 is still a first-person adventure game like prior entries in the series, but this time around, bounty hunter Samus Aran is armed with a motorcycle and a slate of psychic powers. Not all of the new gameplay elements work, but Beyond is a fitting follow-up to what came before, with a lore-heavy story, great combat, and plenty of eerie exploration.

Psh. Who needs an onslaught of push notifications and heart rate monitoring, anyway? Casio’s retro, Y2K-styled WS-B1000 pairs with your phone via Bluetooth and lets you track steps, set timers, and perform only the most basic wristwatch functions imaginable. Nothing more, nothing less.

This 8-in-1 USB-C hub delivers plenty of connectivity, including ethernet, a 4K / 60Hz-capable HDMI port, microSD / SD card readers, USB-C, and USB-A. It can also power your laptop with up to 85W of power.

The Wuben G5 is a rechargeable flashlight about the size of a Zippo lighter, which makes it easy to slip into your pocket. The main light rotates 180 degrees and delivers up to 400 lumens, which you can easily adjust with a scroll wheel. The battery can last up to 65 hours, and a second multicolor LED can cycle through the entire spectrum.

Lego’s Happy Plants can add a little burst of joy to your desk or bookshelf. The set features two playful builds — specifically a baby dracaena and a baby pilea — which fit neatly into a pair of bright, smiley pots. They’re easy to assemble and fun to fiddle with at just 217 pieces, and it’s impossible to be in a bad mood when you look at them considering their adorable faces.

While the Nintendo Switch 2 comes with a respectable 256GB of internal storage, Samsung’s P9 microSD Express card provides double the capacity for your digital library. It offers sequential read speeds of up to 800 MB/s, promising quick launch and load times. It’s also compatible with a wide range of gadgets, including cameras, tablets, and drones with a microSD USH-I slot.

Whether you’re indoors or outdoors, you’ve got to keep your hands warm. Warmth keeps your digits limber, and these rechargeable hand warmers are a great asset, lasting up to 20 hours per charge and going up to 130 degrees Fahrenheit.

Soldering can be intimidating for beginners, but iFixit’s FixHub smart soldering iron makes it simple. It quickly heats up fast via USB-C, and packs safety features like a heat-resistant magnetic storage cap, an LED warning light, and motion sensors to automatically shut off if it falls from your hand. You can also adjust the iron’s temperature settings via your laptop or the Android app.

Don’t get tripped up by the “poetry” part — the Magnetic Poetry Kit is really just about having fun with words. The Original Edition comes with more than 300 magnetic tiles to mix and match, allowing you to cover your fridge with random thoughts, inside jokes, and other carefully chosen creations.

With a sharp rotating blade, Worx’s electric scissors make light work of tougher materials, including quarter-inch plastic, fabric, leather, and cardboard. A safety switch ensures it doesn’t unintentionally turn on, too, while a blade guard can help prevent an unwanted trip to the emergency room.

It’s still hard believe the Amazfit Active 2 retails for less than $100. The humble smartwatch includes everything from offline navigation and voice commands to a strength training mode that can auto-detect sets, reps, and rest periods. It also features a vivid OLED display and a super stylish watchface — which isn’t something often associated with affordable fitness trackers.

If you don’t like the idea of using a hotel towel, then Matador’s Ultralight Travel Towel deserves a spot in your bag. The large version is roughly the size of a standard towel, yet it can pack down into a small mesh bag. It’s made from a soft nanofiber material that can absorb double its weight, and it wrings out easily, so it dries fast. The towel is also machine washable, so you can easily get it ready for your next journey.

You’ll probably need a good pick-me-up while traveling, but you don’t have to settle for bad gas station coffee. First Ascent’s Instant Coffee gives you a solid caffeine boost and a flavor that holds up well, with light, medium, and dark roasts. You just pour it in hot water, stir, and it’s done. Don’t you just love the smell of fresh coffee?

If you’re on a DIY kick, iFixit’s Pro Tech Go Toolkit deserves a spot in your bag. The portable driver kit includes a variety of specialty bits needed to open devices ranging from phones to laptops and gaming consoles. It also comes with tweezers, spudgers, a small suction cup, and opening picks to pry open your devices. Good luck on your repairs!

Percival Everett’s first work of fiction earned him the Pulitzer this year — and it’s no surprise. The bold 2024 tale serves as a reworking of Huck Finn as told by the enslaved man who travels with him down the Mississippi, and although it’s dead serious at times due to the subject matter, it’s also inventive, poetic, and surprisingly funny.

8BitDo’s Micro is a pocket-friendly, 16-button wireless game controller compatible with iOS, Android, and the Nintendo Switch. It can make playing mobile games easier than tapping a touchscreen, and it’s perfect for playing NES, SNES, Game Boy, and Game Boy Advance titles on the Nintendo Switch.

Lego delivered a gigantic dose of nostalgia with a near-perfect replica of Nintendo’s 1989 handheld. The 421-piece set captures the Game Boy’s many buttons, grilles, and curves remarkably well, while the lenticular screen inserts give the illusion of a working unit. It even comes with several brick-ified cartridges you insert into a slot in the back.

While most people are content to store their files in the cloud, some content is too precious not to save on personal digital devices. Sandisk’s multi-plug flash drive makes it easy to move data between phones, tablets, and computers.

Two things most people need at some point are a flashlight and a Bluetooth tracker. So why not gift both devices at once? The FlashFinder is a rechargeable, 300-lumen light outfitted with a magnetic mount you can track via Apple’s Find My network, so you never have to worry about trying to find the flashlight — or your keys — again.

If you own an Android phone, the Google Pixel Buds 2A are a solid, relatively cheap pair of wireless earbuds. They offer crisp sound quality, a comfy design, and solid ANC, which is great given their budget-friendly price tag. They even offer built-in support for Gemini and, unlike the entry-level AirPods, a purple option!

Pocket-friendly power banks that come with built-in USB-C cables are beloved, and it’s easy to see why. Anker’s 10,000mAh Zolo with 30W charging speeds is just big enough, and fast enough, to quickly recharge most small gadgets.

Anker’s 67W Prime charger features two USB-C ports and one USB-A port, along with retractable prongs, rendering it one of our go-to travel companions. It’s a gadget that lets you easily charge a MacBook Air and a Nintendo Switch 2 with a port to spare.

If you attach the Kershaw Recap to your keychain, you’ll always be ready to tackle tiny repairs. The multitool features a flathead screwdriver tip, a bottle opener, and can even double as a pry bar. Plus, it’s made from a durable steel, so it can handle everyday wear and tear, whether you’re tightening the occasional screw or cracking a cold one.

Uno Go is a more portable version of the classic card game. Whether you’re on a plane, at the park, or waiting in line, you can get in a few quick rounds before having to tuck it away in your pocket. It’s an easy way to combat boredom — and a heck of a lot better than staring at a phone or tablet screen.

Amazon’s Echo Spot is a smart alarm clock that can also show you the weather, play music, and set timers. It features a bright, 2.83-inch touchscreen, but you’ll primarily interact with it using your voice, which lets you carry out all sorts of Alexa-based commands.

A basic timer may seem like a thoughtless gift, but there are many tasks we procrastinate on every day that could be more easily managed if we dedicated a little bit of time to them. A visual Pomodoro timer, such as the colorful MOD (Home Edition), is key to helping break tasks into manageable, bite-sized chunks.

It’s not the timeless look that makes Distil’s Folly Sunglasses attractive — though they do look quite good. The real appeal lies in their hidden neodymium magnets, which allow you to clip the polarized shades to your shirt or bag without having to worry about them falling off. That alone is worth the $69 price tag.

A level is an essential tool for DIYers, and none is more foolproof than Franklin’s 12-inch Light Level. The magnetic device turns red when it’s crooked and green when it’s level, so you don’t have to rely solely on a bubble vial (though it includes two built-in bubble vials as well). It runs on a single AA battery and can be seen from almost every angle, regardless of how bright your environment is.

Nomad’s leather MagSafe wallet snaps to the back of your iPhone and has enough space to hold up to four cards. More importantly, it offers integration with Apple’s vast Find My network, allowing you to track its location. Its battery can last up to five months, too, and it can be topped off on a Qi wireless charger.

Anker’s Laptop Power Bank is a lifesaver for anyone on the go. It boasts a 25,000mAh capacity and a total output of up to 165W, allowing you to charge a powerful MacBook Pro to 50 percent in less than 30 minutes. The portable battery also features two built-in USB-C cables, one of which is retractable, so you needn’t worry about tossing yet another cable in your bag.

Stanley’s classic eight-ounce flask is great for tailgating, camping, and summer BBQs. It features a pocket-friendly design, a wide mouth for easy refills, and a hinge-connected cap that won’t get dropped or lost. The flask also features a durable stainless steel design that’s leakproof, ensuring your libation of choice doesn’t spill.

If your TV struggles to run streaming apps well (or at all), consider Onn’s 4K Streaming Device. It supports Dolby Vision HDR and all your favorite apps via the Google TV interface, from Netflix and Disney Plus to YouTube. Recommendations are pulled from across services, and you can even use Google Assistant to search for shows and movies using your voice instead of the remote.

Whether you’re into birding, hiking, or just getting a closer look at far-off signs and locales, you’ll look cool whipping out the ol’ Zoom Tube. This monocular telescope comes in some truly fabulous color schemes, and even if it can’t rival a legitimate pair of binos, it still affords you clear 8x magnification and a terrific field of view.

GE’s 800-lumen Wi-Fi bulbs serve as a great entry point for making your home a little smarter. The color-changing LED bulbs work with Alexa and Google Assistant without a hub, and they support Matter for interoperability with Apple Home, making them a great choice if you’re unsure which smart home platform your giftee uses.

JLab’s ultra-portable speaker can pump out the holiday tunes wherever you celebrate. It offers up to eight hours of continuous playtime, and it can pair with a second Pop Party to create stereo sound. You can also customize the speaker’s RGB lighting, while its IP55 rating means it can endure an accidental spill.

Even the most advanced smartphone cameras struggle to stabilize shaky video. However, with the DJI Osmo Mobile 7, you can attach your phone and record pro-level footage that’s silky smooth, whether you’re vlogging or capturing holiday shenanigans. The handy gimbal features easy-to-use controls, an ergonomic handle, and a built-in tripod, so you can place it on a flat surface if necessary.

Finding the right video game to gift can be a challenge, but Paladone’s cartridge-shaped coasters are a fun alternative for fans of the 8-bit era. Each coaster features cover art from a popular game — whether it be Super Mario Bros., The Legend of Zelda, or Metroid — and can be hand-washed should a beverage spill on it.

Tough hikes require tough socks — or they should, anyway. Luckily, Darn Tough’s merino micro-crew socks offer a well-balanced blend of comfort, cushioning, and durability. In fact, they’re so durable the company continues to pair them with a lifetime guarantee should anything happen to them. No receipt necessary.

Leatherman’s compact Free T4 is a nice entry into the world of multitools, and the one I carry every day. Despite its smaller size, it features 12 tools, including a 420HC knife and spring-action scissors. My favorite is the combination package opener and awl, which is great for opening boxes and plastic blister packaging. Plus, it comes with Leatherman’s famed 25-year warranty.

OpenAI is making it easier to edit emails with ChatGPT, too.

OpenAI will now give you the ability to dial up — or down — ChatGPT’s warmth and enthusiasm. An update rolling out on Friday gives you the option to choose whether you want “more” or “less” of these personality traits, or stick with the default.

There are also options to tweak how often ChatGPT uses emoji, headers, and lists. You can find these settings by tapping the menu at the top left corner of the ChatGPT app, selecting your profile, heading to Personalization, and choosing Add Characteristics. Alongside these options, you can pick a “personality” for the AI chatbot, including whether it’s quirky, professional, friendly, cynical, and more.

Another update changes the way you write emails with ChatGPT, as you can now update and format text directly inside the chat. You can also highlight chunks of text and ask ChatGPT to make specific changes to it, rather than attempting to direct ChatGPT to that section in a separate prompt.

China figured out how to sell EVs. Now it has to bury their batteries.

In the past decade, China has seen an EV boom, thanks in part to government support. Buying an electric car has gone from a novel decision to a routine one; by late 2025, nearly 60% of new cars sold were electric or plug-in hybrids.But as the batteries in China’s first wave of EVs reach the end of their useful life, early owners are starting to retire their cars, and the country is now under pressure to figure out what to do with those aging components.The issue is putting strain on China’s still-developing battery recycling industry and has given rise to a gray market that often cuts corners on safety and environmental standards. National regulators and commercial players are also stepping in, but so far these efforts have struggled to keep pace with the flood of batteries coming off the road.

It’s a weird time to be an AI doomer.This small but influential community believes, in the simplest terms, that AI could get so good it could be bad—very, very bad—for humanity.The doomer crowd has had some notable success over the past several years: including helping shape AI policy coming from the Biden administration. But a number of developments over the past six months have put them on the back foot. Talk of an AI bubble has overwhelmed the discourse as tech companies continue to invest in multiple Manhattan Projects’ worth of data centers without any certainty that future demand will match what they’re building.So where does this leave the doomers? We decided to ask some of the movement’s biggest names to see if the recent setbacks and general vibe shift had altered their views. See what they had to say in our story.—Garrison Lovely

Synthesia’s AI clones are more expressive than ever. Soon they’ll be able to talk back.

Earlier this summer, I visited the AI company Synthesia to create a hyperrealistic AI-generated avatar of me. The company’s avatars are a decent barometer of just how dizzying progress has been in AI over the past few years, so I was curious just how accurately its latest AI model, introduced last month, could replicate me.I found my avatar as unnerving as it is technically impressive. It’s slick enough to pass as a high-definition recording of a chirpy corporate speech, and if you didn’t know me, you’d probably think that’s exactly what it was.My avatar shows how it’s becoming ever-harder to distinguish the artificial from the real. And before long, these avatars will even be able to talk back to us. But how much better can they get? And what might interacting with AI clones do to us? Read the full story.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">In August 2025, Wang Lei decided it was finally time to say goodbye to his electric vehicle.

Wang, who is 39, had bought the car in 2016, when EVs still felt experimental in Beijing. It was a compact Chinese brand. The subsidies were good, and the salesman talked about “supporting domestic innovation.” At the time, only a few people around him were driving on batteries. He liked being early.

But now, the car’s range had started to shrink as the battery’s health declined. He could have replaced the battery, but the warranty had expired; the cost and trouble no longer felt worth it. He also wanted an upgrade, so selling became the obvious choice.

His vague plans turned into action after he started seeing ads on Douyin from local battery recyclers. He asked around at a few recycling places, and the highest offer came from a smaller shop on the outskirts of town. He added the contact on WeChat, and the next day someone drove over to pick up his car. He got paid 8,000 yuan. With the additional automobile scrappage subsidy offered by the Chinese government, Wang ultimately pocketed about 28,000 yuan.

Wang is part of a much larger trend. In the past decade, China has seen an EV boom, thanks in part to government support. Buying an electric car has gone from a novel decision to a routine one; by late 2025, nearly 60% of new cars sold were electric or plug-in hybrids.

But as the batteries in China’s first wave of EVs reach the end of their useful life, early owners are starting to retire their cars, and the country is now under pressure to figure out what to do with those aging components.

The issue is putting strain on China’s still-developing battery recycling industry and has given rise to a gray market that often cuts corners on safety and environmental standards. National regulators and commercial players are also stepping in, building out formal recycling networks and take-back programs, but so far these efforts have struggled to keep pace with the flood of batteries coming off the road.

Like the batteries in our phones and laptops, those in EVs today are mostly lithium-ion packs. Their capacity drops a little every year, making the car slower to charge, shorter in range, and more prone to safety issues. Three professionals who work in EV retail and battery recycling told MIT Technology Review that a battery is often considered to be ready to retire from a car after its capacity has degraded to under 80%. The research institution EVtank estimates that the year’s total volume of retired EV batteries in China will come in at 820,000 tons, with annual totals climbing toward 1 million tons by 2030.

In China, this growing pile of aging batteries is starting to test a recycling ecosystem that is still far from fully built out but is rapidly growing. By the end of November 2025, China had close to 180,000 enterprises involved in battery recycling, and more than 30,000 of them had been registered since January 2025. Over 60% of the firms were founded within the past three years. This does not even include the unregulated gray market of small workshops.

Typically, one of two things happens when an EV’s battery is retired. One is called cascade utilization, in which usable battery packs are tested and repurposed for slower applications like energy storage or low-speed vehicles. The other is full recycling: Cells are dismantled and processed to recover metals such as lithium, nickel, cobalt, and manganese, which are then reused to manufacture new batteries. Both these processes, if done properly, take significant upfront investment that is often not available to small players.

But smaller, illicit battery recycling centers can offer higher prices to consumers because they ignore costs that formal recyclers can’t avoid, like environmental protection, fire safety, wastewater treatment, compliance, and taxes, according to the three battery recycling professionals MIT Technology Review spoke to.

“They [workers] crack them open, rearrange the cells into new packs, and repackage them to sell,” says Gary Lin, a battery recycling worker who worked in several unlicensed shops from 2022 to 2024. Sometimes, the refurbished batteries are even sold as “new” to buyers, he says. When the batteries are too old or damaged, workers simply crush them and sell them by weight to rare-metal extractors. “It’s all done in a very brute-force way. The wastewater used to soak the batteries is often just dumped straight into the sewer,” he says.

This poorly managed battery waste can release toxic substances, contaminate water and soil, and create risks of fire and explosion. That is why the Chinese government has been trying to steer batteries into certified facilities. Since 2018, China’s Ministry of Industry and Information Technology has issued five “white lists” of approved power-battery recyclers, now totaling 156 companies. Despite this, formal recycling rates remain low compared with the rapidly growing volume of waste batteries.

China is not only the world’s largest EV market; it has also become the main global manufacturing hub for EVs and the batteries that power them. In 2024, the country accounted for more than 70% of global electric-car production and more than half of global EV sales, and firms like CATL and BYD together control close to half of global EV battery output, according to a report by the International Energy Agency. These companies are stepping in to offer solutions to customers wishing to offload their old batteries. Through their dealers and 4S stores, many carmakers now offer take-back schemes or opportunities to trade in old batteries for discount when owners scrap a vehicle or buy a new one.

BYD runs its own recycling operations that process thousands of end-of-life packs a year and has launched dedicated programs with specialist recyclers to recover materials from its batteries. Geely has built a “circular manufacturing” system that combines disassembly of scrapped vehicles, cascade use of power batteries, and high recovery rates for metals and other materials.

CATL, China’s biggest EV maker, has created one of the industry’s most developed recycling systems through its subsidiary Brunp, with more than 240 collection depots, an annual disposal capacity of about 270,000 tons of waste batteries, and metal recovery rates above 99% for nickel, cobalt, and manganese.

“No one is better equipped to handle these batteries than the companies that make them,” says Alex Li, a battery engineer based in Shanghai. That’s because they already understand the chemistry, the supply chain, and the uses the recovered materials can be put to next. Carmakers and battery makers “need to create a closed loop eventually,” he says.

But not every consumer can receive that support from the maker of their EV, because many of those manufacturers have ceased to exist. In the past five years, over 400 smaller EV brands and startups have gone bankrupt as the price war made it hard to stay afloat, leaving only 100 active brands today.

Analysts expect many more used batteries to hit the market in the coming years, as the first big wave of EVs bought under generous subsidies reach retirement age. Li says, “China is going to need to move much faster toward a comprehensive end-of-life system for EV batteries—one that can trace, reuse and recycle them at scale, instead of leaving so many to disappear into the gray market.”

            <div id="article-text">Not long ago, like many of you, I read what I feared might be The Next Web’s final article. In late September, TNW’s co-founder announced that the tech conference and news site would be winding down, no more events, no new stories. It felt like the end of an era; the news hit hard.

Yet, just a few weeks ago, a twist arrived: the tech platform Tekpon acquired 100% of TNW’s media and events brand from the Financial Times, ensuring that this nearly two-decade legacy will continue to thrive.

While, myself, trying to read people’s opinions on this topic, I read this comment in one article, from one former TNW editor-in-chief that said: “The Next Web shaped my career, my life… it’s very sad to see it die”.

The latest rumblings from the EU tech scene, a story from our wise ol&#39; founder Boris, and some questionable AI art. It&#39;s free, every week, in your inbox. Sign up now!

I asked myself: Why do we always assume that just because one chapter ends, the whole story is over? Yes, taking over TNW is a heavy inheritance, especially with all eyes on us and expectations sky-high.

And I’ll admit, doubts crept in: Am I too small for this? Could someone more experienced do it better? Probably. But here I am, stepping up regardless. Because this isn’t just another blog or brand; TNW is a living ecosystem, a vital community. Its story deserves to continue, and I’m determined to help write the next chapter.

I also know some of you might be wondering: Who is she? What does she know? How many articles has she written? What recommends her?

Before reading all sorts of titles and, let me briefly introduce myself.

I’ve been writing since high school, with thousands of articles under my belt; covering everything from culture, art, and hip hop to design, politics, history, and food. I landed my first content writer job at 18, and alongside writing I pursued another passion: becoming a chef.

(Fun fact: I even made it to the semifinals of MasterChef, a journey that taught me about creativity under pressure and staying cool when the heat is on.)

Now, I channel my storytelling skills into helping businesses better understand technology and use it to their advantage. I help companies tell their stories, the real ones, finding meaning and flow in every word.

Over the years, I’ve specialized in blending creative storytelling with the technical precision of a chef’s knife. (My colleagues at Tekpon might say I can be as sharp as that knife – true to my values and quick to cut through the nonsense.) I am also the “No, we have to do it right” person in the team.

I’ve reviewed countless software products, interviewed founders, and explored how digital innovation can be a force for good in society. Or not. In other words, I’ve always cared about the why behind the tech, the real impact on people’s lives, not just the buzz. That perspective will be behind every story we will publish at TNW.

If there’s a place for those who still think stories written by humans matter, tell me where it is. I’m already on my way.

I’m not here to change TNW’s DNA; I’m here to reinforce it with fresh energy and a clear vision for the future.

To the loyal TNW readers, to the startup founders who looked to us for inspiration, to the healthy tech skeptics who counted on us for a reality check, and to our global audience spread across continents: we hear you.

We all know the world of tech news has changed dramatically. Today, everyone has a megaphone, social media overflows with hot takes, and AI algorithms can crank out content in seconds. It’s easy to feel overwhelmed by this sea of opinions and auto-generated articles. In such a world, the role of a publication like TNW is more critical than ever: to be a filter, not just another firehose of content.

We will focus on curation and clarity, distilling the noise so you don’t have to.

Here’s the good news: despite the deluge of AI-written text out there, readers are actively looking for authentic, human journalism. Every article we will publish will be created by a human writer who is accountable for the facts and who brings context, analysis, and yes, a bit of personality too.

Our mission isn’t to chase every trending headline algorithmically; it’s to help you understand which innovations actually matter, and why.

If a story is everywhere but lacks substance, we won’t regurgitate it; we’ll analyze it or debunk it. If a breakthrough is genuinely promising, we’ll explain why it’s important and how it impacts real people. Being a thoughtful filter in this age of information overload (and AI-generated noise) isn’t just a catchy slogan for us; it’s a responsibility we embrace.

You’ll also notice something different in our approach: an emphasis on storytelling and the human side of tech. Technology doesn’t exist in a vacuum; it’s built and used by people with dreams, dilemmas, and diverse backgrounds.

I believe, and I suspect many of you do too, that the best tech journalism zooms out from the gadgets and code to highlight those human stories. Practically speaking, expect to see more features, interviews, and narrative-driven pieces on TNW.

We’ll talk to founders about the messy, human journey of building a startup, not just the press releases or funding announcements. We’ll spotlight the engineers, designers, and thinkers who are trying to solve big problems (or even small ones that make a big difference). We’ll explore tech’s impact on society: the good, the bad, and the complicated.

This won’t be a place for recycled press releases or surface-level takes. It will be a place for conversation and insight.

Importantly, none of this focus on storytelling means we’ll skimp on rigor. Being engaging doesn’t mean sacrificing accuracy or depth. My team will continue to prioritize thorough research and fact-checking, those good old-school journalism values, even as we experiment with new formats and new voices. In short, we won’t publish anything we wouldn’t want to read ourselves.

Today, looking forward means acknowledging that how we cover tech is as important as what we cover. It means committing to journalism that cuts through the clutter, to storytelling that puts people first, and to a vision of tech’s future that is both hopeful and honest. That’s my vision for TNW as I step into this role, and I hope it resonates with you.

Now, I’d like to turn it over to you, our community. This is your TNW as much as it is ours. I invite you to join the conversation. Tell us what you want to see more of (or less of). Hold us accountable,if we ever fall short, let us know. Share your stories and perspectives with us, because they can inspire our coverage.

In the coming weeks, you’ll start to see this vision take shape on the site. You’ll see familiar faces and new voices. You’ll find articles that make you think, others that make you smile, and hopefully quite a few that make you proud to be a TNW reader.

Whether you’re a long-time follower who’s stuck with us through thick and thin, a startup founder looking for insight, a skeptic keeping us honest, or a curious mind tuning in from anywhere in the world – thank you.  We do this for you, and we couldn’t do it without you.

The Next Web is back. We’re here to inform you, inspire you, challenge you, and occasionally even surprise you. I’m honored to have you with us on this journey. Here’s to the road ahead, to storytelling, to journalism (the real kind), and to making sense of the future together.

Thank you for reading, and welcome to TNW’s next chapter. Let’s build it, day by day, story by story, together.

            <div id="article-text">When OpenAI announced its new shopping search capabilities, I took the news with a grain of salt (perhaps the whole shaker).
For the past decade, we have watched the slow evolution of traditional search engines. What began as tools for pure information discovery gradually morphed into ecosystems dominated by SEO-optimized content and sponsored results. My initial fear with ChatGPT’s update was simple: Are we seeing the beginning of a similar shift? Is the purity of the “reasoning engine” being diluted by the necessity of commerce?
After testing the new shopping integration, the results suggest that we are at a pivotal moment in the user experience of Generative AI, one that requires an open discussion about what we actually want these tools to be.

The defining characteristic of Large Language Models (LLMs) is their ability to handle nuance. When we interact with ChatGPT, we expect a Socratic dialogue. We expect the AI to ask clarifying questions to narrow down our intent.
To test this, I entered a simple prompt: “I want to buy a vacuum.”
I anticipated a conversation, questions about my home’s square footage, my floor type, or my budget. Instead, the conversational nuance was replaced by a display that felt familiar: a grid of product photos, names, prices, and direct links to retailers.

While efficient, this experience felt like a regression. It mirrored the “keyword search” experience of Web 2.0 rather than the “intent-based” promise of GenAI. It replied to my prompt, but it stripped away the intelligence.

Scrolling down, I engaged with the new feature in a call to action: “Research the best vacuums.”
This is where the user experience (UX) friction became most apparent. Rather than synthesizing data or comparing technical specifications in a chat format, the tool presented a polling interface designed to filter results.

The experience is oddly time-sensitive; pause too long to think or drink water, and the screens will skip forward, dumping you back into a list of product cards.
The interface presents products with a binary choice: “More like this” or “Not interested.” It offers brand names and price tags, but virtually no information to help the user actually make a choice.

For a user seeking genuine research, being presented with a list of brands and prices without deep comparative analysis feels like a missed opportunity.
It raises a question: If I wanted to filter products by price and brand, wouldn’t I use a traditional retailer? The value proposition of Gen AI should be synthesis, not just aggregation.

The Tension Between Reasoning and Revenue
This update highlights the inevitable tension facing major AI companies: the balance between user utility and business sustainability.
As OpenAI scales, the pressure to demonstrate revenue models to investors is natural. However, there is a risk in prioritizing transactional features before the core product, reasoning and logic, is fully matured. By introducing a shopping experience that feels closer to a “click-through” engine than a “knowledge” engine, the platform risks blurring its own identity.
Is ChatGPT a research partner that helps me think? Or is it a shopping assistant trying to speed me to checkout?

To be clear, I believe there is a place for shopping within AI. But the execution matters.
A truly Generative AI shopping experience shouldn’t just list products; it should understand the user. It should read between the lines of a prompt to understand that a user asking for a vacuum might actually be solving a problem about pet hair or allergies.

The current iteration feels like a beta test of a business model rather than an evolution of intelligence. As we move forward, the hope is that OpenAI will refine this tool to prioritize the “Chat” over the transaction. We don’t want it to be just another place to see ads. We need a better way to make decisions.
