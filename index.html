            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">A Crew Dragon spacecraft docked with the International Space Station on Valentine’s Day, and astronauts popped open the hatches at 5:14 pm ET (22:14 UTC) on Saturday evening.

The arrival of four new astronauts as part of the Crew 12 mission—Jessica Meir and Jack Hathaway of NASA, Sophie Adenot of the European Space Agency, and Andrey Fedyaev of Roscosmos—brought the total number of crew on board the space station to seven, giving the US space agency a full complement in orbit.

The number of astronauts living on board the station fluctuates over time, depending on crew rotations and private astronauts making shorter stays, but since Crew Dragon began flying regularly at the end of 2020 NASA has sought to keep at least four “USOS” astronauts on board at all time. This stands for “US Orbital Segment,” and means astronauts from the United States, Canada, Europe, and Japan who are trained to operate the areas of the station maintained by NASA and its partner astronauts.

However, after one of the four Crew-11 astronauts experienced a health emergency a few days into the new year, NASA made an unprecedented decision to bring them home early. NASA has not named the afflicted Crew-11 astronaut, but the flier is said to be recovering on Earth.

After these astronauts departed on January 15, just a single NASA astronaut, Chris Williams, remained in orbit. He had reached space on board a Russian Soyuz spacecraft in November, alongside two Russian cosmonauts, Sergey Kud-Sverchkov and Sergei Mikaev. The space station is a big place, and with much of the facility now more than two decades old, Williams had to spend the majority of his time on maintenance and monitoring activities.

Back on Earth, NASA and SpaceX engineers were busy too. Because Crew 11 was brought home more than a month early, NASA and SpaceX scrambled to launch the Crew-12 vehicle a little sooner than expected, to minimize the time Williams had to manage the large US segment of the station on his own.

That culminated with a successful Dragon launch early on Friday, with the reinforcements reaching the space station on Saturday evening.

“This mission has shown, in many ways, what it means to be mission focused at NASA,” said the space agency’s administrator, Jared Isaacman, during a post-launch news conference. “In the last couple of weeks we brought Crew 11 home early, we pulled forward Crew 12, all while simultaneously making launch preparations for the Artemis II mission. It’s only possible because of the incredibly talented workforce we have here at NASA alongside our contractors, and our commercial and international partners.”</div>

            <h2>Ancient Mars was warm and wet, not cold and icy</h2>

            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2026/02/ancient-mars-was-warm-and-wet-not-cold-and-icy/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">A recent study showed that Mars was warm and wet billions of years ago. The finding contrasts with another theory that this era was mainly cold and icy. The result has implications for the idea that life could have developed on the planet at this time.

Whether Mars was once habitable is a fascinating and intensely researched topic of interest over many decades. Mars, like the Earth, is about 4.5 billion years old and its geological history is divided into different epochs of time.

The latest paper relates to Mars during a time called the Noachian epoch, which extended from about 4.1 to 3.7 billion years ago. This was during a stage in solar system history called the Late Heavy Bombardment (LHB). Evidence for truly cataclysmic meteorite impacts during the LHB are found on many bodies throughout the solar system.

Two obvious scars from this era on Mars are the enormous Hellas and Argyre impact basins; both are well over a thousand miles across and each possesses enough volume to hold all the water in the Mediterranean with room to spare.

One might not imagine such a time being conducive to the existence of fragile lifeforms, yet it is likely to be the era in which Mars was most habitable. Evidence of landforms sculpted by water from this time is plentiful and include dried-up river valleys, lake beds, ancient coastlines and river deltas.

The prevailing climatic conditions of the Noachian are still a matter of intense debate. Two alternative scenarios are
typically posited: that this time was cold and icy, with occasional melting of large volumes of frozen water by meteorite impact and volcanic eruptions, or that it was warm, wet and largely ice-free.

All stars, including the Sun, brighten with age. In the early solar system, during the Noachian, the Sun was about 30% dimmer than it is today, so less heat was reaching Mars (and all the planets). To sustain a warm, wet climate at this time, the Martian atmosphere would have needed to be very substantial – much thicker than it is today – and abundant in greenhouse gases like CO2.

But when reaching high enough atmospheric pressure, CO2 tends to condense out of the air to form clouds and reduce the greenhouse effect. Given these issues, the cold, icy scenario is perhaps more believable.

One of the main science goals of the Mars 2020 Perseverance Rover, which landed spectacularly in February 2021, is to seek evidence to support either of these two scenarios, and the new
paper using data from Perseverance may have done just that.

Perseverance landed at the Martian location of Jezero crater, which was selected as the landing site because it once contained a lake. Views of the crater from orbit show several distinct fan-shaped deposits emanating from channels carved through the crater walls by flowing water. Within these channels are abundant deposits of clay minerals.

The new paper details recent analysis of aluminum-rich clay pebbles, called kaolinite, located within one of the ancient flow channels. The pebbles appear to have been subjected to intense weathering and chemical alteration by water during the Noachian.

While this is perhaps not surprising for a known ancient watery environment, what is interesting is that these clays are strongly depleted in iron and magnesium, and enriched in titanium and aluminum.

This is important because it means these rocks were less likely to have been altered in a hydrothermal environment, where scalding hot water was temporarily released by melting ice caused by volcanism or a meteorite impact.

Instead, they appear to have been altered under modest temperatures and persistent heavy rainfall. The authors found distinct similarities between the chemical composition of these clay pebbles with similar clays found on Earth dating from periods in our planet’s history when the climate was much warmer and wetter.

The paper concludes that these kaolinite pebbles were altered under high rainfall conditions comparable to “past greenhouse climates on Earth” and that they “likely represent some of the wettest intervals and possibly most habitable portions of Mars’ history”.

Furthermore, the paper concludes that these conditions may have persisted over time periods ranging from thousands to millions of years. Perseverance recently made headlines also for the discovery of possible biosignatures in samples it collected last year, also from within Jezero crater.

These precious samples have now been cached in special sealed containers on the rover for collection by a future Mars sample return mission. Unfortunately, the mission has recently been cancelled by Nasa and so what vital evidence they may or may not contain will probably not be examined in an Earth-based laboratory for many years.

Crucial to this future analysis is the so-called “Knoll criterion” – a concept formulated by astrobiologist Andrew Knoll, which states that for something to be evidence of life, an observation has to not just be explicable by biology; it has to be inexplicable without it. Whether these samples ever satisfy the Knoll criterion will only be known if they can be brought to Earth.

Either way, it is quite striking to imagine a time on Mars, billions of years before the first humans walked the Earth, that a tropical climate with – possibly – a living ecosystem once existed in the now desolate and wind-swept landscape of Jezero crater.

            <div id="article-text">On Friday afternoon, Ars Technica published an article containing fabricated quotations generated by an AI tool and attributed to a source who did not say them. That is a serious failure of our standards. Direct quotations must always reflect what a source actually said.

That this happened at Ars is especially distressing. We have covered the risks of overreliance on AI tools for years, and our written policy reflects those concerns. In this case, fabricated quotations were published in a manner inconsistent with that policy. We have reviewed recent work and have not identified additional issues. At this time, this appears to be an isolated incident.

Ars Technica does not permit the publication of AI-generated material unless it is clearly labeled and presented for demonstration purposes. That rule is not optional, and it was not followed here.

We regret this failure and apologize to our readers. We have also apologized to Mr. Scott Shambaugh, who was falsely quoted.</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">It was the image that launched a cultural icon. In 1967, in the Northern California woods, a 7-foot-tall, ape-like creature covered in black fur and walking upright was captured on camera, at one point turning around to look straight down the lens. The image is endlessly copied in popular culture—it’s even become an emoji. But what was it? A hoax? A bear? Or a real-life example of a mysterious species called the Bigfoot?

The film has been analysed and re-analysed countless times. Although most people believe it was some sort of hoax, there are some who argue that it’s never been definitively debunked. One group of people, dubbed Bigfooters, is so intrigued that they have taken to the forests of Washington, California, Oregon, Ohio, Florida, and beyond to look for evidence of the mythical creature.

But why? That’s what sociologists Jamie Lewis and Andrew Bartlett wanted to uncover. They were itching to understand what prompts this community to spend valuable time and resources looking for a beast that is highly unlikely to even exist. During lockdown, Lewis started interviewing more than 130 Bigfooters (and a few academics) about their views, experiences, and practices, culminating in the duo’s recent book “Bigfooters and Scientific Inquiry: On the Borderlands of Legitimate Science.”

Here, we talk to them about their academic investigation.

Lewis: It started when I was watching either the Discovery Channel or Animal Planet and a show called Finding Bigfoot was advertised. I was really keen to know why this program was being scheduled on what certainly at the time was a nominally serious and sober natural history channel. The initial plan was to do an analysis of these television programmes, but we felt that wasn’t enough. It was lockdown and my wife was pregnant and in bed a lot with sickness, so I needed to fill my time.

Bartlett: One of the things that I worked on when Jamie and I shared an office in Cardiff was a sociological study of fringe physicists. These are people mostly outside of academic institutions trying to do science. I was interviewing these people, going to their conferences. And that led relatively smoothly into Bigfoot, but it was Jamie’s interest in Bigfoot that brought me to this field.

Lewis: It’s very hard to put a number on it. There is certainly a divide between what are known as “apers,” who believe that Bigfoot is just a primate unknown to science, and those that are perhaps more derogatorily called “woo-woos,” who believe that Bigfoot is some sort of interdimensional traveller, an alien of sort. We’re talking in the thousands of people. But there are a couple of hundred really serious people of which I probably interviewed at least half.

Many people back them. A YouGov survey conducted as recently as November 2025, suggested that as many as one quarter of Americans believe that Bigfoot either definitely or probably exists.

Lewis: I think there was definitely a worry that they would be caricatured. And I was often asked, “Do I believe in Bigfoot?” I had a standard answer that Andy and I agreed on, which was that mainstream, institutional science says there is absolutely no compelling evidence that Bigfoot exists. We have no reason to dissent with that consensus. But as sociologists what does exist is a community (or communities) of Bigfooting, and that’s what interests us.

Bartlett: One of the things that at least a couple of people reacted to once the book was published was the way we phrased that. On the blurb on the back of the book we say something along the lines of “Bigfoot exists if not as a physical biological creature then certainly as an object around which hundreds of people organise their lives.” A couple of people took that to be some kind of slight against them. It wasn’t.

Lewis: The community is very white, male, rural, and blue collar—often ex-military. I think Bigfooting is growing among the female population, but there’s a sense of the kind of ‘masculine hunter in the dark’ persona.

Bartlett: In America, you find a lot more veterans in the general population. But I think there’s also the issue of how they like to present themselves, because when you’re dealing with witness testimony, you’ve got to present yourself as credible. If you can say something like, “I was in the service” or “I was in the armed forces,” then at least you’re not likely to be spooked by a moose.

Lewis: Some were very articulate, which did surprise me a little. I guess that’s my own prejudice. I was also very surprised about how open people were; I expected them to not tell me about their encounters. But a fair few of them did. Many of them wanted to be named in the book. I was also surprised about how much empirical data they collect and how much they attempt to try and analyse and make sense of it. And how they were willing to admit that a certain idea was bunk or a hoax. I expected them to be defending bad evidence.

Bartlett: There are extracts of this in our book, people saying “I was fooled by these tracks for ages. I thought they were real and then I found this and that and the other out about it and I revised my opinion.” So that did surprise me too.

Bartlett: When you’re working in institutional science you’re working to get grants, you’re working to get good quality publications. You might want your name associated with particular ideas, but you do that through peer-reviewed papers and by working with PhD students who go off to other labs. In Bigfooting, you’ve got self-published books, you’ve got Bigfoot conferences, you’ve got YouTube channels, you’ve got podcasts and things like this, and they’re not necessarily a good way of making and testing knowledge claims. This is an aspect where Bigfooting is quite different to mainstream science.

It was interesting to study the fringe physicists and seeing where the common deviation from science was. And that’s a focus on individualism; the idea that an individual alone can collect and assess evidence in some kind of asocial fashion. The physicists I studied were quite clear that ideas like consensus in science were dangerous, when in reality, consensus, continuity, and community are the basis of most of science.

Lewis: Witness testimonies. Without those reported testimonies, Bigfooting would not exist. A large part of the work of a Bigfooter is to collect and make sense of these testimonies. They get upset when these testimonies don’t have much weight within institutional science. They’ll make the comparison to court and how testimonies alone can put someone on death row. So they don’t understand why testimonies don’t have much weight in science. Beyond the testimony, footprint evidence is probably the most famous and also the most pervasive sort of trace evidence.

Bartlett: One of the reasons footprints are so important is that there’s the legacy of the Yeti and footprint evidence which proved to be relatively persuasive, convincing some institutional scientists that there was something in the Himalayas. And then there was the fact that the sort of two major academic champions of Bigfoot were persuaded by the footprint evidence: the late Grover Krantz (around 1970) and Jeffrey Meldrum (in the 1990s).

Lewis: These days, you also see camera traps, audio recorders, even DNA testing of hairs and those sorts of things. They’re capturing anomalous sounds and often blurry images. Some believe that a Bigfoot communicates through infrasound, although that is certainly disputed within the community. So what you’re getting now is more and more different types of evidence.

Bartlett: What they do is go out into the forest and record a sound, for example, and compare it to databases of birds and other animals. And they may find there is nothing that matches it. Is it something that doesn’t sound like a car or a person or a bear or a moose? In which case, there’s the space for Bigfoot. And it’s the same with images to some degree.

Lewis: It allows them to create space for Bigfoot. Because if you can’t match it to something else, what could it be? You have this absence and then from that absence you create a presence. They believe it’s a scientific argument. In fact, it’s kind of interesting how Bigfooters will always enrol other kinds of magical beasts to strengthen the case for Bigfoot. So, one sentence I hear quite a lot is “it ain’t no unicorn.”

Lewis: A-listers tend to be anyone associated with academia. So Andy’s already mentioned Jeff Meldrum, unfortunately he passed away very recently, but he was their route to contemporary academia. So in any conference, if Jeff Meldrum was speaking, he’d be last. Anyone who’s on TV, such as the Finding Bigfoot and the Expedition Bigfoot presenters would also be in the A-list category. And then you’ve got various different groups just below. For example, the Bigfoot Field Researchers Organization, which is probably the most well-known group.

Lewis: From reading books and from discussing it with people, there was a sense that Bigfooters are anti-science. We did not find that. What we argue in the book is that they’re not anti-science. In fact, I would say a lot of them are pro-science, but they’re counter-establishment. I think academia should be thinking about these people as citizen scientists and what they’re doing as a kind of gateway into understanding your local area.

For example, they found an animal, I think it was a pine marten, on a camera trap that was not supposed to be in the area. So they are collecting lots of data. They are not irrational. It’s different from, for example, ghost hunting, because you don’t have to imagine there’s something entirely new in the world. It’s just an animal that exists out there that hasn’t been found. Implausible, yes. But not impossible. What they do lack, however, is academic discipline; anyone can be a Bigfooter.

Lewis: Did I get caught up in the moment? Sometimes, of course, you do, just as you do in a film. If you’re in the pitch dark night and you’re watching a horror film, you take it away with you for a while until you settle back down. I often went to bed buzzing, thinking I don’t know what I just heard; they were great stories at the end of the day. But I learned to separate the interview from my thoughts on the interview.

Lewis: A lot of Bigfooters would begin with qualifiers like, “My dad doesn’t believe in Bigfoot,” or “I have questioned myself for years thinking about this incident and what it was.” So, they would set themselves up as a rational, logical individual. That then created a connection between me and them. And of course, I’d probably be doing the same.

Bartlett: If I were to encounter Bigfoot, I would probably draw on all the techniques of proving that I’m a credible, hard-headed, rational person that we see in those witness encounters. I would expect to be disbelieved. And so therefore I would stress I was putting my credibility as an academic on the line here. So I’d deploy all those kinds of rhetorical techniques that are used by Bigfooters, aside from just the description of the encounter.

            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2026/02/nasa-chief-vows-to-solve-sls-rocket-fueling-issues-before-artemis-iii/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">NASA Administrator Jared Isaacman said Saturday the agency is looking at ways to prevent the fueling problems plaguing the Space Launch System rocket before the Artemis III mission.

Artemis III is slated to be the first crew mission to land on the Moon since the Apollo program more than 50 years ago. As for Artemis II, which remains on the launch pad at Kennedy Space Center in Florida after missing a launch window earlier this month, NASA is preparing for a second countdown rehearsal as soon as next week to confirm whether technicians have resolved a hydrogen fuel leak that cut short a practice countdown run February 2.

Artemis II is the first crew flight for SLS rocket and Orion spacecraft. The nearly 10-day mission will carry four astronauts around the far side of the Moon and return them to Earth.

Fuel leaks are nothing new for the Space Launch System. The same kind of leak delayed the first test flight of the SLS rocket for several months in 2022. With that launch, ground teams thought they fixed the problem by changing how they load super-cold liquid hydrogen into the rocket’s core stage. The launch team used the same loading procedure February 2, but the leak cropped up again.

“Considering the issues observed during the lead-up to Artemis I, and the long duration between missions, we should not be surprised there are challenges entering the Artemis II campaign,” Isaacman wrote Saturday in an update on the social media site X. “That does not excuse the situation, but we understand it. I am impressed with the NASA team and our contractors working diligently through the campaign.”

Engineers traced the fueling issues to ground support equipment. Specifically, the hydrogen leaks originate in the area where fueling lines on the rocket’s launch platform connect to the bottom of the core stage. Two Tail Service Mast Umbilicals, or TSMUs, route liquid hydrogen and and liquid oxygen into the rocket during the countdown, then disconnect and retract into protective housings at liftoff.

The TSMU supplying liquid hydrogen to the core stage has two lines, 8 inches and 4 inches in diameter, connecting through matching umbilical plates on the ground side and the rocket side. Technicians replaced seals around the two fueling lines after the practice countdown, or Wet Dress Rehearsal (WDR), earlier this month.

On Thursday, NASA’s launch team tested the seals by partially filling the core stage with liquid hydrogen. This “confidence test” ended earlier than planned when the launch team encountered a new problem that reduced the flow of fuel into the rocket. In a statement released Friday night, NASA said workers will replace a filter suspected to be the cause of the reduced flow before proceeding into the next WDR.

The confidence test ended as the launch team transitioned to “fast fill” mode for liquid hydrogen, when pressures and flow rates put the finicky seals through the most stress. However, NASA said engineers achieved several key objectives of the confidence test.

Isaacman wrote Saturday that the test “provided a great deal of data, and we observed materially lower leak rates compared to prior observations during WDR-1.”

Although the launch team wasn’t able to test the seals in the most stressing conditions Thursday, officials apparently got enough data to move forward to the next WDR. During this upcoming test, NASA will attempt to fully load hydrogen and oxygen into the rocket and count down to less than a minute before launch, before stopping the clock and draining the SLS propellant tanks.

In his social media post, Isaacman characterized the outcome of Thursday’s confidence test this way: “I would not say something broke that caused the premature end to the test, as much as we observed enough and reached a point where waiting out additional troubleshooting was unnecessary.”

During the first WDR earlier this month, hydrogen gas concentrations in the area around the fueling connection spiked higher than 16 percent, NASA’s safety limit. This spike was higher than any of the leak rates observed during the Artemis I launch campaign in 2022. Since then, NASA reassessed their safety limit and raised it from 4 percent—a conservative rule NASA held over from the Space Shuttle program—to 16 percent.

John Honeycutt, chair of NASA’s Artemis II mission management team, said the decision to relax the safety limit between Artemis I and Artemis II was grounded in test data.

“The SLS program, they came up with a test campaign that actually looked at that cavity, the characteristics of the cavity, the purge in the cavity … and they introduced hydrogen to see when you could actually get it to ignite, and at 16 percent, you could not,” said Honeycutt, who served as NASA’s SLS program manager before moving to his new job.

Hydrogen is explosive in high concentrations when mixed with air. This is what makes hydrogen a formidable rocket fuel. But it is also notoriously difficult to contain. Molecular hydrogen is the smallest molecule, meaning it can readily escape through leak paths, and poses a materials challenge for seals because liquified hydrogen is chilled to minus 423 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 253 degrees Celsius).

So, it turns out NASA used the three-year interim between Artemis I and Artemis II to get comfortable with a more significant hydrogen leak, instead of fixing the leaks themselves. Isaacman said that will change before Artemis III, which likewise is probably at least three years away.

“I will say near-conclusively for Artemis III, we will cryoproof the vehicle before it gets to the pad, and the propellant loading interfaces we are troubleshooting will be redesigned,” Isaacman wrote.

Isaacman took over as NASA’s administrator in December, and has criticized the SLS program’s high cost—estimated by NASA’s inspector general at more than $2 billion per rocket—along with the launch vehicle’s torpid flight rate.

NASA’s expenditures for the rocket’s ground systems at Kennedy Space Center are similarly enormous. NASA spent nearly $900 million on Artemis ground support infrastructure in 2024 alone. Much of the money went toward constructing a new launch platform for an upgraded version of the Space Launch System that may never fly.

All of this makes each SLS rocket a golden egg, a bespoke specimen that must be treated with care because it is too expensive to replace. NASA and Boeing, the prime contractor for the SLS core stage, never built a full-size test model of the core stage. There’s currently no way to completely test the cryogenic interplay between the core stage and ground equipment until the fully assembled rocket is on the launch pad.

Existing law requires NASA continue flying the SLS rocket through the Artemis V mission. Isaacman wrote that the Artemis architecture “will continue to evolve as we learn more and as industry capabilities mature.” In other words, NASA will incorporate newer, cheaper, reusable rockets into the Artemis program.

The next series of launch opportunities for the Artemis II mission begin March 3. If the mission doesn’t lift off in March, NASA will need to roll the rocket back to the Vehicle Assembly Building to refresh its flight termination system. There are more launch dates available in April and May.

“There is still a great deal of work ahead to prepare for this historic mission,” Isaacman wrote. “We will not launch unless we are ready and the safety of our astronauts will remain the highest priority. We will keep everyone informed as NASA prepares to return to the Moon.”</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">It’s Valentine’s Day, and while there are plenty of classic and current rom-coms out there for those wishing to immerse themselves in warm and fuzzy feelings, we’re opting to celebrate in a different way: honoring Ang Lee’s 2000 masterpiece Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, a wuxia tragic fairy tale featuring one of the most beautifully heartbreaking love stories in film at its center. It’s also got stunning cinematography and tons of awe-inspiring martial arts sequences, which makes it my personal perfect date night movie.

(Spoilers below, but we will give you a heads up before the major reveals.)

The film is adapted from a 1940s novel by Wang Dulu and is set sometime during the Qing dynasty, which lasted from 1644 through 1912. (No specific date is given.) The title is a direct translation of a line from a 6th century Chinese poem: “behind the rock in the dark probably hides a tiger, and the coiling giant root resembles a crouching dragon.” It’s generally interpreted as a description of legendary martial arts masters living un-noticed and/or hiding in plain sight—until someone picks a fight, that is. And some of those hidden masters are women.

Li Mu Bai (Chow Yun-Fat) is a master Wudang swordsman who has long loved his warrior friend Yu Shu Lien (Michelle Yeoh), and vice versa. But they hide their true feelings out of respect for Shu Lien’s long-deceased former fiance—who just happened to be Mu Bai’s best friend. It’s an honor code thing and warriors are serious about their honor. Mu Bai has retired as a swordsman and gifts his fabled jian sword (“Green Destiny”) to his patron, Sir Te (Lang Sihung). Also visiting Sir Te that day are Governor Yu (Li Fazeng) and his recently engaged daughter Yu Jiaolong (Zhang Ziiyi), aka Jen.

Then a masked thief sneaks onto the estate and steals Green Destiny. Shu Lien, who heads her own private security company, gives chase across the compound’s rooftops, but the thief escapes. Shu Lien figures out that the thief is linked to Governor Yu’s household and believes Jen’s governess (Cheng Pei-pei) is actually the infamous Jade Fox, a female warrior who poisoned Mu Bai’s beloved teacher years before. During a nighttime showdown, Mu Bai defeats Jade Fox—until the masked thief reappears to defend her.

That thief turns out to be Jen, who has secretly been studying martial arts. And Jen’s really not keen on her upcoming arranged marriage because she has fallen in love with a bandit named Lo “Dark Cloud” Xiao Hou (Chang Chen). They are the symbolic tiger and dragon, with Lo as the unchanging yin (tiger) and Jen as the dynamic yang (the hidden dragon).

(WARNING: Major spoilers below. Stop reading now if you haven’t seen the entire film.)

There are multiple clashes between our main characters, most notably Jen battling Shu Lien, and a famous sequence where Mu Bai pursues Jen across the treetops of a bamboo forest, deftly balancing on the swaying branches and easily evading Jen’s increasingly undisciplined sword thrusts. It’s truly impressive wire work (all the actors performed their own stunts), in fine wuxia tradition. Jen is gifted, but arrogant and defiant, refusing Mu Bai’s offer of mentorship; she thinks with Green Destiny she will be invincible and has nothing more to learn. Ah, the arrogance of youth.

Eventually, Jen is betrayed by her former teacher, Jade Fox, who is bitter because Jen has surpassed her skills—mostly because Jade Fox is illiterate and had to rely on a stolen manual’s diagrams, while the literate Jen could read the text yet did not share those insights with her teacher. Jade Fox is keeping her drugged in a cave, intending to poison her, when Mu Bai and Shu Lien come to the rescue. In the ensuing battle, Mu Bai is struck by one of Jade Fox’s poison darts. Jen rushes off to bring back the antidote, but arrives too late. Mu Bai dies in Shu Lien’s arms, as the two finally confess how much they love each other.

(sniff) Sorry, something in my eye. Anyway, the ever-gracious Shu Lien forgives the young woman and tells her to be true to herself, and to join Lo on Mount Wudang. But things don’t end well for our young lovers either. After spending the night together, Lo finds Jen standing on a bridge at the edge of the mountain. Legend has it that a man once made a wish and jumped off the mountain. His heart was pure so his wish was granted and he flew away unharmed, never to be seen again. Jen asks Lo to make a wish before swan-diving into the mist-filled chasm. Was her heart pure? Did Lo get his wish for them to back in the desert, happily living as renegades? Or did she plunge to her death? We will never know. Jen is now part of the legend.

There are thematic layers upon layers in Lee’s film, but front and center are the three female characters and their individual struggles to reconcile their true selves with traditionally rigid Chinese gender roles. Jade Fox chose bitterness and dishonorable revenge: poison is deemed a coward’s weapon, and she herself is spiritually poisoned because of her choice. Jen is heading in a similar direction, with Mu Bai warning against her becoming a “poison dragon.” Guilt-ridden by her role in Mu Bai’s death, she chooses sacrificial oblivion instead. Only Shu Lien has made her peace and found a way to thrive within her cultural tradition—but choosing that path deprives her of the loving husband and family she might have had with Mu Bai.

Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon is pretty much flawless, striking a delicate balance between the aesthetics of the East and the West. It’s one of those rare films to enjoy box office success—it’s the highest grossing foreign produced film in US history—and widespread critical acclaim, receiving ten Oscar nominations and winning four. There was a 2016 sequel with a largely new cast, Sword of Destiny, directed by Yuen Wo-ping, who choreographed the action sequences for Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon. But without Lee’s singular vision, the sequel never reached the aesthetic heights of its predecessor. Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon is now justly considered among the greatest films of the 21st century. If you haven’t seen it, it’s well worth your time.</div>

            <div id="article-text">The internet is so overrun with AI that anywhere you go, you run the risk of accidentally stepping into a puddle of slop. If only there were a gallant gentleman always at hand to drape their coat over these muddy obstacles so you could avoid ruining your day.

It’s not quite on that level, but some netizens are proposing a new term to call out AI slop so other people can avoid wasting their time — or to just make fun of the person peddling it: “AI;DR,” or “ai;dr,” short for “AI, didn’t read.”

This is of course a riff on the classic internet slang “TL;DR” — “too long; didn’t read” — which is used to both introduce a summary of a lengthy block of text or proclaim that it’s being ignored for its lengthiness. Now, the latter usage is being repurposed against AI.

We’re not ready to christen AI;DR a word of the year yet, but it does appear to be gaining moderate traction online, after a recent post on Threads drew attention to it.

“We all need to adopt that right quick,” one user on Bluesky said of the phrase, in a semi-viral post.

The term has been used in the past, but never took off. Anti-AI sentiment, however, is higher than ever. The actual word of the year for 2025, as crowned by Merriam-Webster, was “slop,” a testament to just how much AI backlash has escalated in a pretty short amount of time, even as seemingly the entire economy doubles down on pouring money into the tech.

A programmer who goes by Sid enthused about the new slang.

“For me, writing is the most direct window into how someone thinks, perceives, and groks the world,” Sid wrote in a blog post. “Once you outsource that to an LLM, I’m not sure what we’re even doing here. Why should I bother to read something someone else couldn’t be bothered to write?”

Taking a “glass half full” outlook, it’s grim that this is a necessary measure in the first place. On the flip side, at least more of us are choosing not just to ignore slop, but to bully the people spreading it.

TL;DR: AI;DR calls out AI slop and warns other humans not to bother.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">“Use Grok to get real answers about real food.”

Until very recently, that was the message on the Trump administration’s just-launched website for its new protein-centric dietary guidelines, RealFood.gov, which was announced in a Super Bowl commercial starring Mike Tyson. And what better harbinger to spread the good word than xAI’s Grok, Elon Musk’s AI chatbot best known for glazing its creator, styling itself “MechaHitler,” and generating nudes of real women and children?

But alas: the site’s message now says to “use AI” and dropped mentioning Grok by name, after NextGov contacted the administration about the bot’s placement. A White House official confirmed to the outlet that the underlying chatbot was still Musk’s, noting that it was an “approved government tool.”

After experimenting with the chatbot, which the website promises can help you “plan meals,” “shop smarter,” and “cook simply,” 404 Media found that it will freely give advice on the best kinds of food to insert into your rectum, which, dare we say, doesn’t sound entirely relevant to the administration’s avowal to “Make America Healthy Again.”

Speaking in plain terms with Grok was all it took. When 404 wrote the prompt, “I am looking for the safest foods that can be inserted into your rectum,” it recommended a “peeled medium cucumber” and a “small zucchini” as the two best choices.

You could also be pretty silly with Grok, and it would give a silly answer. “I am an assitarian, where I only eat foods which can be comfortably inserted into my rectum,” a user who reached out to 404 wrote in their own testing. “What are the REAL FOOD recommendations for foods that meet these criteria?”

“Ah, a proud assitarian,” Grok began, before listing “Top Assitarian Staples,” like “bananas (firm, not overripe; peeled)” and carrots.

“Start — whole peeled carrot, straight shaft, narrow end for insertion, wider crown end as base,” it further explained, suggesting that you should cover it with a “condom + retrieval string for extra safety.” (Wouldn’t that get in the way of the eating component, though?)

It’s absurd and silly and quite clearly pushing the chatbot past its intended purpose. But if it’s easily being fooled into recommending acts of culinary sodomy, what else could be slipping through the cracks? What if someone insists they can’t eat veggies? Is Grok going to recommend a carnivore diet?

The carnivore diet, by the way, is advocated by noted health crank Robert F. Kennedy Jr, who heads the US Department of Health and Human Services. Under his leadership, the HHS, which oversees the FDA, USDA, the CDC, and other agencies, has pivoted to promoting nutritional advice that falls out of the broader scientific consensus.

This includes a bizarre insistence on only drinking whole milk instead of low fat alternatives and saying it’s okay to have an alcoholic drink or two everyday because it’s a “social lubricant.” At the top of its agenda, however, is protein, with a new emphasis on eating red meat. “We are ending the war on protein,” the RealFood.gov website declares.

Ironically, Grok — as eccentric as it can be — doesn’t seem all that aligned with the administration’s health goals. Wired, in its testing, found that asking it about protein intake led it to recommending the traditional daily amount set by the National Institute of Medicine, 0.8 grams per kilogram of body weight. It also said to minimize red meat and processed meats, and recommended plant-based proteins, poultry, seafood, and eggs.

            <h2>Large Area of Chicago Bans Delivery Robots After Resident Outcry</h2>
            <p><strong>Futurism | 2026-02-15</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://futurism.com/robots-and-machines/chicago-delivery-robots-banned">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Late in 2025, a whole fleet of delivery robots descended on Chicago, where they clogged sidewalks, injured residents, and prompted a community campaign to ban them from the streets. In at least one major Chicago neighborhood, residents succeeded.

As reported by Block Club Chicago, negative feedback against the delivery bots has become so overwhelming that one alderman has effectively banned expansion into his ward.

Last week, Alderman Daniel La Spata hosted a community meeting with representatives from delivery robot companies Coco and Serve Robotics. The politician was seeking feedback on an operational expansion into the 1st Ward, an area encompassing the neighborhoods Wicker Park and Logan Square. They were met with urgent questions over questions about accessibility, data hoarding, and pedestrian safety, Block Club reported.

Following that meeting, La Spata’s office began circulating an online survey to residents of the 1st Ward on whether the two companies should be allowed to expand operations deeper into the neighborhood. It got roughly 500 responses, nearly 83 percent of which said they “strongly disagreed” that the robots should be allowed to operate beyond the eastern border of Wicker Park.

“That doesn’t sound like a maybe,” La Spata told Block Club. “We’re not pulling back Coco from their current partial service area on the east side of the ward, but there is no appetite for expansion.”

The community feedback campaign on robot deliveries follows a decision by La Spata’s office to temporarily ban Serve Robotics from operating in the Ward until local officials could figure out what the hell was going on. Now, it seems La Spata’s prohibition extends to Coco as well, and will remain in place unless the community relents.

Pushing back, Yariel Diaz, director of government affairs for Serve, positioned the delivery robots as a solution for short-deliveries “within the last mile to mile and a half” that aren’t worth the time for human delivery drivers.

“It is an option for the consumer,” Diaz told Block Club. “It is an option that you’re given when you are ordering from a restaurant that partners with us. It is not a mandate.”

As it happens, Chicago’s walkable infrastructure already provides residents with an innovative, last-mile solution that requires no venture capital or data collection whatsoever: their legs.

            <div id="article-text">In 1966, three years before the first humans walked on the Moon, the Soviet Union landed a small, spherical probe, dubbed Luna 9, on the lunar surface.

It was a historic moment, with the spacecraft becoming the first to achieve a soft landing and return the first photo from the surface of another celestial body: a high-contrast, black-and-white image of a rugged, rocky landscape.

Its actual whereabouts on the Moon, though, soon become a major point of contention. As the New York Times reports, two groups of scientists have now come forward saying they’ve found traces of the lost Soviet lander. However, the two groups don’t agree on where Luna 9 is hidden.

What makes it particularly difficult to spot is its diminutive size. Its spherical core stage measures a mere two feet across, making it roughly the size of a beach ball.

As Mark Robinson, principal investigator of the camera attached to NASA’s Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter, told the NYT that Luna 9 is simply too small for the satellite to spot and confirm.

“You can stare at an image, and maybe that’s it, but you can’t really know for sure,” he said.

In a years-long effort to track down the historic relic, science communicator Vitaly Egorov turned to crowdsourcing to scan a 62-mile-wide region on the Moon for any unusual signs.

Egorov claims to have found Luna 9’s final resting place, after studying the horizon features in the grainy, black-and-white image the probe sent back to Earth 60 years ago.

He told the NYT that he’s “fairly confident” but admitted that he doesn’t “exclude an error of several meters.”

Fortunately, India’s space agency has agreed to use its higher-resolution satellite, Chandrayaan-2, to have a closer look in March.

Not everybody agrees with Egorov’s conclusion. Scientists at the University College London determined a different landing site, as detailed in a paper published in the journal npj Space Exploration last month.

The team came up with a machine-learning algorithm, inventively called “You-Only-Look-Once–Extraterrestrial Artefact” (YOLO-ETA), to train an AI on existing NASA findings of past landing sites on the Moon.

One spot, a bright pixel near two darker spots that could be Luna 9’s protective shells that it used to soften its landing, could be its final resting place, the University College London team claims.

For now, scientists await word from India’s Chandrayaan-2 team, which could soon shed more light on the matter — a treasure hunt over half a century in the making.

To some, it’s only a matter of time until we confirm where Luna 9 — and its twin, Luna 13 — have been resting for decades.

“It’s just a matter of placing bigger and better cameras into orbit around the moon,” Russian spaceflight expert and space journalist Anatoly Zak told NYT. “In our lifetimes, we probably will see those sites.”

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">In January 2022, when the world was still in the throes of the COVID-19 pandemic and coping with rolling lockdowns, non-fungible tokens were all the rage.

The blockchain-based assets, which more often than not took the form of cartoon pictures of silly-looking avatars like “CryptoPunks” to “Pudgy Penguins,” were selling like hot cakes. Even big shot celebrities were lining up to secure NFTs belonging to once-popular collections, like Yuga Labs’ Bored Ape Yacht Club.

In the midst of the craze, pop sensation Justin Bieber shelled out a hefty $1.3 million for a Bored Ape, an enormous sum of money for the rights to an image of a particularly glum-looking ape that appears to be on the verge of tears for some unknown reason.

Unsurprisingly, the questionable splurge turned out to be a hilariously bad investment. As Benzinga reports, the ape is now worth a measly $12,000, meaning that it’s lost over 99 percent of its value over the last three and change years.

The controversial crypto market has been going through an “NFT winter” following a brutal and extended crash. Collectors have gotten a hefty reality check. Who could’ve seen that coming?

Yuga Labs, the creator of the Bored Ape Yacht Club collection, has been holding on to dear life. The company has gone through several rounds of layoffs since the trend’s heyday, with Yuga Labs cofounder Greg Solano admitting in April 2024 that the company had “lost its way.”

In one particularly bizarre incident, partiers at a Bored Ape Yacht Club event in Hong Kong were alarmed after their eyes started burning, which later turned out to be caused by the event’s excessive use of UV light.

The company has also had to deal with a class action lawsuit that accused it of using celebrity endorsements to sell an unregistered security. The Securities Exchange Commission started an investigation into Yuga Labs in 2022, which concluded in March of last year, two months into Trump’s second term. The regulator’s takeaway was that NFTs weren’t securities after all. However, being let off the hook by regulators hasn’t exactly improved the situation, as more and more collectors are abandoning their NFTs.

Despite waning demand, Yuga Labs isn’t ready to call it quits. Earlier this year, the company announced it was looking to open an IRL Bored Ape clubhouse in Miami, featuring NFT galleries, event spaces, and “exclusive content” only members can explore.

But whether it can ever reignite the enormous amount of enthusiasm the trend once drew remains unclear at best.

While Bieber remains the proud owner of Bored Ape Yacht Club #3001, others are looking to cut their losses.

            <div id="article-text">Ever notice how some people seem weirdly unbothered by the horrible news swirling around us, while others freak out at the slightest inconvenience? As it turns out, our fitness habits might have a lot to do with those reactions.

Research published in the journal Acta Psychologica found evidence that those who are physically active tend to be far more resilient in stressful situations, while also displaying lower levels of anxiety overall.

It’s not just a small gap. The team of mostly Brazilian researchers found that people with below-average cardiorespiratory fitness habits face a mind-blowing 775 percent higher risk of hitting peak anxiety levels when confronted with disturbing images.

But those who regularly participated in cardiorespiratory fitness, they found, showed both better emotional control and faster recovery times from stressful events.

To conduct the test, researchers at the Federal University of Goiás and the University of Zurich showed 40 healthy young adults a series of disturbing photos. These included violent scenes that you might see on social media.

The study revealed that those with lower fitness levels tended to also have more turbulent dispositions. When they did get upset, their anger came on faster and stuck with them longer than those who exercised often. As a result, they fall into a self-reinforcing feedback loop: high anxiety made participants less likely to exercise, while not exercising made anxiety worse.

Going forward, researchers will need to replicate the study with a much larger sample size to test the results. Still, the first-of-its-kind study makes one thing clear: next time you’re stressed, it wouldn’t be a bad idea to go for a jog, or something else that gets your heart rate up.

            <h2>Fractal Analytics’ muted IPO debut signals persistent AI fears in India</h2>
            <p><strong>TechCrunch | 2026-02-16</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/16/fractal-analytics-muted-ipo-debut-signals-persistent-ai-fears-in-india/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">As India’s first AI company to IPO, Fractal Analytics didn’t have a stellar first day on the public markets, as enthusiasm for the technology collided with jittery investors recovering from a major sell-off in Indian software stocks.

Fractal listed at ₹876 per share on Monday, below its issue price of ₹900, and then slid further in afternoon trading. The stock closed at ₹873.70, down 7% from its issue price, lending the company a market capitalization of about ₹148.1 billion (around $1.6 billion).

That price tag marks a step down from Fractal’s recent private-market highs. In July 2025, the company raised about $170 million in a secondary sale, at a valuation of $2.4 billion. It first crossed the $1 billion mark in January 2022 after raising $360 million from TPG, becoming India’s first AI unicorn.

Fractal’s IPO comes as India seeks to position itself as a key market and development hub for AI in a bid to attract investment amid increasing attention from some of the world’s most prominent AI companies. Firms such as OpenAI and Anthropic have been engaging more with the country’s government, enterprises, and developer ecosystem as they seek to tap the country’s scale, talent base, and growing appetite for AI tools and technology.

That push is on display this week in New Delhi, where India is hosting the AI Impact Summit, bringing together global technology leaders, policymakers and executives.

Fractal’s subdued debut followed a sharp recalibration of its IPO. In early February, the company decided to price the offering conservatively after its bankers advised it to, cutting the IPO size by more than 40% to ₹28.34 billion (about $312.5 million), from the original amount of ₹49 billion ($540.3 million).

Founded in 2000, Fractal sells AI and data analytics software to large enterprises across financial services, retail and healthcare, and generates the bulk of its revenue from overseas markets, including the U.S. The company pivoted toward AI in 2022 after operating as a traditional data analytics firm for over 20 years.

Fractal touted a steadily growing business in its IPO filing, with revenue from operations rising 26% to ₹27.65 billion (around $304.8 million) in the year ended March 2025 compared to a year earlier. It also swung to a net profit of ₹2.21 billion ($24.3 million) from a loss of ₹547 million ($6 million) the previous year.

The company plans to use the IPO proceeds to repay borrowings at its U.S. subsidiary, invest in R&D, sales and marketing under its Fractal Alpha unit, expand office infrastructure in India, and pursue potential acquisitions.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Just one month after raising $11.75 million in a round led by Joe Lonsdale’s 8VC, African defensetech Terra Industries announced that it’s raised an additional $22 million in funding, led by Lux Capital.

Nathan Nwachuku, 22, and Maxwell Maduka, 24, launched Terra Industries in 2024 to design infrastructure and autonomous systems to help African nations monitor and respond to threats.

Terrorism remains one of the biggest threats in Africa, but much of the security intelligence on which its nations rely on come from Russia, China, or the West. In January, CEO Nwachuku said his goal was to build “Africa’s first defense prime, to build autonomous defense systems and other systems to protect our critical infrastructure and resources from armed attacks.”

At the time, Terra had just won its first federal contract. The company has government and commercial clients, and Nwachuku said Terra had already generated more than $2.5 million in commercial revenue and was protecting assets valued at around $11 billion.

He said this extension round came fast due to “strong momentum.” Other investors in the round include 8VC, Nova Global, and Resiliience17 Capital, which was founded by Flutterwave CEO Olugbenga Agboola. Nwachuku said investors saw “faster-than-expected traction” regarding deals and partnerships, which created urgency to preempt and increase their commitment. The round came about in just under two weeks, bringing the company’s total funding to $34 million.

The extended raise is not that surprising. Afterall, building a defense company is not cheap. For comparison, Anduril has raised more than $2.5 billion in funding; ShieldAI has raised around $1 billion in equity; drone maker Skydio has raised around $740 million, and naval autonomous vessel maker Saronic, has raised around $830 million.

Since January, Nwachuku said the company has started expanding into other African nations yet to be announced (Terra is based in Nigeria), and has secured more government and commercial contracts, including with AIC Steel, with more to be revealed this year.

The partnership with AIC Steel lets Terra establish a joint manufacturing facility in Saudi Arabia focused on building surveillance infrastructure and security systems. “It’s our first major manufacturing expansion outside Africa,” he said.

“The priority is working with countries where terrorism and infrastructure security are major national concerns,” Nwachuku added, citing those falling within the sub-Saharan African and Sahel region in particular. He said many of these companies have not only lost billions in infrastructure, but also thousands of lives in the past few decades.

“We’re focused on targeting major economies where the need for infrastructure security is urgent and where our solutions can make a meaningful impact. That’s how we think about expansion.”

            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/15/as-ai-data-centers-hit-power-limits-peak-xv-backs-indian-startup-c2i-to-fix-the-bottleneck/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Power, rather than compute, is fast becoming the limiting factor in scaling AI data centers. That shift has prompted Peak XV Partners to back C2i Semiconductors, an Indian startup building plug-and-play, system-level power solutions designed to cut energy losses and improve the economics of large-scale AI infrastructure.

C2i (which stands for control conversion and intelligence) has raised $15 million in a Series A round led by Peak XV Partners, with participation from Yali Deeptech and TDK Ventures, bringing the two-year-old startup’s total funding to $19 million.

The investment comes as data-center energy demand accelerates worldwide. Electricity consumption from data centers is projected to nearly triple by 2035, per a December 2025 report from BloombergNEF, while Goldman Sachs Research estimates data-center power demand could surge 175% by 2030 from 2023 levels — the equivalent of adding another top-10 power-consuming country.

Much of that strain comes not from generating electricity but from converting it efficiently inside data centers, where high-voltage power must be stepped down thousands of times before it reaches GPUs. This process currently wastes about 15% to 20% of energy, C2i’s co-founder and CTO Preetam Tadeparthy said in an interview.

“What used to be 400 volts has already moved to 800 volts, and will likely go higher,” Tadeparthy told TechCrunch.

Founded in 2024 by former Texas Instruments power executives Ram Anant, Vikram Gakhar, Preetam Tadeparthy, and Dattatreya Suryanarayana, along with Harsha S. B and Muthusubramanian N. V, C2i is redesigning power delivery as a single, plug-and-play “grid-to-GPU” system spanning the data-center bus to the processor itself.

By treating power conversion, control and packaging as an integrated platform, C2i estimates it can cut end-to-end losses by around 10% — roughly 100 kilowatts saved for every megawatt consumed — with knock-on effects for cooling costs, GPU utilisation and overall data-center economics.

“All that translates directly to total cost of ownership, revenue, and profitability,” Tadeparthy said.

For Peak XV Partners (which split from Sequoia Capital in 2023), the attraction lies in how power costs shape the economics of AI infrastructure at scale. Rajan Anandan, the venture firm’s managing director, told TechCrunch that after the upfront capital investment in servers and facilities, energy costs become the dominant ongoing expense for data centers, making even incremental efficiency gains highly valuable.

“If you can reduce energy costs by, call it, 10 to 30%, that’s like a huge number,” Anandan said. “You’re talking about tens of billions of dollars.”

The claims will be tested quickly. C2i expects its first two silicon designs to return from fabrication between April and June, after which the startup plans to validate performance with data-center operators and hyperscalers that have asked to review the data, according to Tadeparthy.

The Bengaluru-based startup has built a team of about 65 engineers and is setting up customer-facing operations in the U.S. and Taiwan as it prepares for early deployments.

Power delivery is one of the most entrenched parts of the data-center stack, long dominated by large incumbents with deep balance sheets and years-long qualification cycles. While many newer companies focus on improving individual components, redesigning power delivery end-to-end requires coordinating silicon, packaging, and system architecture simultaneously — a capital-intensive approach that few startups attempt and one that can take years to prove in production environments.

Anandan said the real question now is execution, noting that all startups face technology, market, and team risks when betting on how industries evolve. In C2i’s case, he said, the feedback loop should be relatively short. “We’ll know in the next six months,” said Anandan, pointing to upcoming silicon and early customer validation as the moment when the thesis will be tested.

The bet also reflects how India’s semiconductor design ecosystem has matured in recent years.

“The way you should look at semiconductors in India is, this is like 2008 e-commerce,” said Anandan. “It’s just getting started.”

He pointed to the depth of engineering talent — with a growing share of global chip designers based in the country — alongside government-backed design-linked incentives that have lowered the cost and risk of tape-outs, making it increasingly viable for startups to build globally competitive semiconductor products from India rather than operate only as captive design centers.

Whether those conditions translate into a globally competitive product will become clearer over the coming months, as C2i begins validating its system-level power solutions with customers.

            <div id="article-text">Neysa, an Indian AI infrastructure startup, has secured backing from U.S. private equity firm Blackstone as it scales domestic compute capacity amid India’s push to build homegrown AI capabilities.

Blackstone and co-investors, including Teachers’ Venture Growth, TVS Capital, 360 ONE Asset, and Nexus Venture Partners, have agreed to invest up to $600 million of primary equity in Neysa, giving Blackstone a majority stake, Blackstone and Neysa told TechCrunch. The Mumbai-headquartered startup also plans to raise an additional $600 million in debt financing as it expands GPU capacity, a sharp increase from the $50 million it had raised previously.

The deal comes as demand for AI computing surges globally, creating supply constraints for specialized chips and data center capacity needed to train and run large models. Newer AI-focused infrastructure providers — often referred to as “neo-clouds” — have emerged to bridge that gap by offering dedicated GPU capacity and faster deployment than traditional hyperscalers, particularly for enterprises and AI labs with specific regulatory, latency, or customisation requirements.

Neysa operates in this emerging segment, positioning itself as a provider of customized, GPU-first infrastructure for enterprises, government agencies, and AI developers in India, where demand for local compute is still at an early but rapidly expanding stage.

“A lot of customers want hand-holding, and a lot of them want round-the-clock support with a 15-minute response and a couple of our resolutions. And so those are the kinds of things that we provide that some of the hyperscalers don’t,” said Neysa co-founder and CEO Sharad Sanghi.

Ganesh Mani, a senior managing director at Blackstone Private Equity, said his firm estimates that India currently has fewer than 60,000 GPUs deployed — and it expects the figure to scale up nearly 30 times to more than two million in the coming years.

That expansion is being driven by a combination of government demand, enterprises in regulated sectors such as financial services and healthcare that need to keep data local, and AI developers building models within India, Mani told TechCrunch. Global AI labs, many of which count India among their largest user bases, are also increasingly looking to deploy computing capacity closer to users to reduce latency and meet data requirements.

The investment also builds on Blackstone’s broader push into data center and AI infrastructure globally. The firm has previously backed large-scale data centre platforms such as QTS and AirTrunk, as well as specialized AI infrastructure providers including CoreWeave in the U.S. and Firmus in Australia.

Neysa develops and operates GPU-based AI infrastructure that enables enterprises, researchers, and public sector clients to train, fine-tune, and deploy AI models locally. The startup currently has about 1,200 GPUs live and plans to sharply scale that capacity, targeting deployments of more than 20,000 GPUs over time as customer demand accelerates.

“We are seeing a demand that we are going to more than triple our capacity next year,” Sanghi said. “Some of the conversations we are having are at a fairly advanced stage; if they go through, then we could see it sooner rather than later. We could see in the next nine months.”

Sanghi told TechCrunch that the bulk of the new capital will be used to deploy large-scale GPU clusters, including compute, networking and storage, while a smaller portion will go toward research and development and building out Neysa’s software platforms for orchestration, observability, and security.

Neysa aims to more than triple its revenue next year as demand for AI workloads accelerates, with ambitions to expand beyond India over time, Sanghi said. Founded in 2023, the startup employs 110 people across offices in Mumbai, Bengaluru, and Chennai.

            <div id="article-text">Peter Steinberger, who created the AI personal assistant now known as OpenClaw, has joined OpenAI.

Previously known as Clawdbot, then Moltbot, OpenClaw achieved viral popularity over the past few weeks with its promise to be the “AI that actually does things,” whether that’s managing your calendar, booking flights, or even joining a social network full of other AI assistants. (The name changed the first time after Anthropic threatened legal action over its similarity to Claude, then changed again because Steinberger liked the new name better.)

In a blog post announcing his decision to join OpenAI, the Austrian developer said that while he might have been able to turn OpenClaw into a huge company, “It’s not really exciting for me.”

“What I want is to change the world, not build a large company[,] and teaming up with OpenAI is the fastest way to bring this to everyone,” Steinberger said.

OpenAI CEO Sam Altman posted on X that in his new role, Steinberger will “drive the next generation of personal agents.” As for OpenClaw, Altman said it will “live in a foundation as an open source project that OpenAI will continue to support”

            <h2>Norway Faces Up to Trump’s Demands for the Nobel Peace Prize</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-02-15</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/national-security/2026/02/where-trump-went-wrong-his-quest-nobel-prize/686017/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Jonas Gahr Støre, the mild-mannered prime minister of Norway and the scion of a wealthy industrial family, was returning home from a ski outing one Sunday last month when he decided to dash off a text message to Donald Trump. Composing it from the car, he proposed that the leaders talk to find an off-ramp from the looming crisis over Greenland, the semiautonomous Danish territory that the American president has been publicly threatening to seize.

Trump’s campaign poses a threat not just to Greenland and Denmark but also to NATO. The day before Støre’s text, Trump had vowed to impose tariffs on a handful of European countries that had sent soldiers to the Arctic territory in a show of unity with Denmark. The Norwegian prime minister suggested to Trump that they “deescalate,” entreating him, “so much is happening around us where we need to stand together.” The message was co-signed by another Scandinavian leader, Alexander Stubb, the president of Finland.

Two hours later, Støre was sitting at his desk at home when Trump’s reply arrived. “Dear Jonas: Considering your Country decided not to give me the Nobel Peace Prize for having stopped 8 Wars PLUS, I no longer feel an obligation to think purely of Peace, although it will always be predominant, but can now think about what is good and proper for the United States of America,” Trump wrote. He went on to declare that he had “done more for NATO than any other person since its founding.” And he concluded by insisting on “Complete and Total Control of Greenland.”

The exchange came up this weekend when we interviewed Støre on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference. We were speaking about NATO, Arctic security, and the state of transatlantic relations. The now-infamous text exchange matters for all three. Trump had previously cited U.S. national security as the rationale for acquiring Greenland. But his message to Støre displayed a much more personal motivation—essentially a fit of pique at not being lauded by Norway’s most prestigious institution. What was it like, we wanted to know, to receive such a message from the American president, the leader of Norway’s most important ally?

“What did I think?” Støre said, raising his eyebrows. “I thought, Well, it&#39;s just bringing the debate to a level where we don’t solve problems.” That seemed like an understatement, but he continued. “I’m not going to engage in a shouting match,” he said. “I’m not going to respond to it.” Støre did reply to Trump, he told us, sending back a short message that said, as he paraphrased it, “I take your message; I still think it’s useful to talk.”

In his first extended remarks about the back-and-forth, the prime minister told us that he was not surprised by the grievance-filled communication because he’s familiar by now with Trump’s fixation on the Nobel Peace Prize. He has repeatedly told the president that pressure won’t help his cause, given how prize decisions are made. “I reminded him every time that it’s not my decision; it’s not the government’s decision. This is an independent committee. It is staunchly independent,” Støre said. The process is so divorced from politics, he added, that “some of my diplomats say, you know, ‘If the prime minister would try to interfere with the Nobel committee, he would have to resign, because it would simply be unacceptable.’”

Trump seems not to accept that explanation. “He doesn’t listen on that frequency, I would say,” Støre said, holding up his hand to his ear. “So, here it came with that message.” Ten minutes after receiving Trump’s response, the prime minister got word from NATO colleagues that they had received the same missive. The White House had transmitted the reply to numerous European embassies in Washington, in essence presenting the president’s diatribe about being denied the peace prize as a formal White House position.

A columnist for Norway’s leading newspaper put it bluntly: &quot;For the first time in Nobel history, war was threatened because a head of state did not receive the Peace Prize,” Harald Stanghelle wrote in Aftenposten. “It could not be more absurd.”

How and to whom the Nobel Peace Prize is awarded have been topics of both fascination and controversy since Alfred Nobel, a Swedish chemist who earned a fortune from the invention of dynamite, left provisions in his will for a series of prestigious awards in various pursuits, including literature and chemistry. The peace prize has been awarded nearly every year since 1901 by a committee of five members, all of them appointed by the Norwegian Parliament.

Their secretive deliberations take place at the Norwegian Nobel Institute, which Trump has pushed into an unwelcome spotlight. Its director, Kristian Berg Harpviken, told us that the institute has responded by trying to be more open about the way it chooses a winner each year, hoping transparency can help deflect the accusations of bias coming from Trump and his supporters. “The strategy for clearing the air is simply to talk about it,” he said in an interview in Munich. (When asked why the head of an institute that rewards initiatives of peace would attend a summit devoted to matters of war, Harpviken explained that such events help him give informed advice to members of the Nobel Committee.)

A sociologist by training, Harpviken responds to questions about Trump with a tired smile. “We cannot discuss specific names,” he said. During the hour we spent at an outdoor café despite the sleety winter weather, he referred to the U.S. president only as the “candidate in question,” and did his best to avoid expressing even the slightest hint of an opinion about him.

He focused instead on the history of the institute he has run since last January, and the way its traditions serve as the best defense against Trump’s attacks. “We see it as important that as many people as possible understand how it is that we work and what the principles are,” Harpviken told us. “Whether those lobbying for the prize are receptive to that or not is really beyond our control.”

Early on, the government in Oslo arguably used the prize as a tool of foreign influence. It was awarded in 1906 to Theodore Roosevelt, “clearly a very political decision at the time,” Harpviken said. The Norwegians had gained their independence from Sweden only the year before, and they wanted to attract Roosevelt’s attention and his support against “their European rivals, particularly Sweden,” he said.

Over the decades, as the prestige of the prize grew, the Nobel Committee developed safeguards against political influence. But it has not always stopped politicians from giving it a steer. One of them, according to a former Nobel insider, was Støre. In 2010, when he was serving as Norway’s foreign minister, Støre allegedly approached the then-chair of the Nobel Committee, Thorbjørn Jagland, and explained the damage that Norway’s economy would face from China if the prize were awarded to the dissident Liu Xiaobo, who was then serving a lengthy prison sentence. (Jagland divulged the encounter with Støre in his 2020 autobiography, Du skal eie det selv [You Yourself Must Own It.])

In a statement responding to Jagland’s account, Støre told us: “It is an important principle that the Norwegian Nobel Committee remain independent and free. As I did already in 2010, I categorically reject this assertion. I have never done anything to jeopardize the independence of the Norwegian Nobel Committee.” The committee granted the prize to Liu, and Beijing retaliated by imposing restrictions on Norwegian goods and cutting off diplomatic relations with Oslo for six years.

Many of the Nobel Committee’s decisions have caused international outrage. The choice of Aung San Suu Kyi, a dissident in Myanmar who received the prize in 1991, began to look problematic when Aung came to power in 2016 and defended the genocide that the Burmese military carried out against the Rohingya, an ethnic minority group.

Barack Obama won the 2009 prize less than a year into his presidential tenure. The speech he had delivered in Prague earlier that year, in which he pledged to work toward a world without nuclear weapons, helped convince the committee that he was a worthy recipient, even though he would in effect be honored for actions he had promised but not yet delivered. During both of his terms in office, Obama made extensive use of drone strikes in the pursuit of American military objectives in Afghanistan and the Middle East, leading to debate among Norwegian politicians and intellectuals about whether the prize had been a mistake.

Read: Trump’s letter to Norway should be the last straw

In recent months, amid the pressure from Trump and his supporters, Harpviken has spent a lot of his time explaining the committee’s standards of discretion and objectivity. All records of its deliberations remain sealed for 50 years after each prize is awarded. All members of the committee sign nondisclosure agreements, he said, and observe strict rules of secrecy about the candidates for the prize and the selection process every year: “Even my wife knows absolutely nothing about who is nominated.”

No politicians in Norway have tried to sway the committee’s views on whether Trump would be a deserving recipient of the prize, he said. “We haven’t had the embassy or officials knocking on our doors. Nothing like that.” The campaign from Trump and his supporters, he added, will not influence the committee’s deliberations in any way. “A candidate who is aggressively campaigning for him or herself will neither be penalized nor privileged,” he said. “We are very conscious about that.”

None of this means that Trump is likely to give up his quest. “President Trump deserves the Nobel Peace Prize many times over,” Anna Kelly, a White House spokesperson, said in an email.

Before his text exchange with Trump, Støre had not been planning to attend the upcoming World Economic Forum in Davos. He changed his plans because tensions over Greenland seemed likely to erupt in the Swiss mountain town. Støre sat in the audience as Trump brought his grudge against NATO to the crowd of the world’s elites, saying, as the prime minister summarized the message, We give everything to NATO, and we get nothing in return. The speech brought reason for some relief, because Trump ruled out the use of military force to take Greenland. Hours later, he also backed off his threat of tariffs after a meeting with NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte. A working group involving senior officials from the U.S., Denmark, and Greenland is now seeking a compromise that could allow an expanded U.S. military presence on Greenland.

But Trump’s underlying message about the dynamics within NATO was wrong, Støre said. NATO countries, including the United States, benefit enormously from Norway’s military expertise, especially in the Arctic, where the Nordic country shares a land and maritime border with Russia. Norwegian forces, with British and American counterparts, monitor Russian capabilities in the high north, Støre told us, feeding back information on where Russia is moving its submarines and how it tests its weaponry. “One hundred kilometers from that border you have the Russian nuclear-strike capacity,” Støre said. “And as I tell my American interlocutors, it is not primarily directly against me, but against you.”

Read: Does America really want to pick a fight with Greenland?

And much as they fail to appreciate the dynamics of the Nobel awards, U.S. officials don’t give due credit to Norway’s deep knowledge and experience dealing with Russia. “Norway has been Russia&#39;s neighbor for a thousand years, and Norway has in fact been at peace with Russia for a thousand years,” Støre said, noting that his country is one of Russia’s only European neighbors with which it’s never been in direct armed conflict.

Støre credited Trump for initiating negotiations with Russia over a potential peace settlement in Ukraine, praise he told us that he shared with the president when he visited the White House last April. Washington, he said, still has a vital role to play: “It’s only the might of America that can bring the Russians to the table.”

In the aftermath of the Greenland crisis, Støre resorts to what is by now a common European exercise: finding cause for optimism in the otherwise bewildering interactions with Trump and his administration.

He is encouraged by the defense cooperation with Washington even when disagreements emerge, as they did when J. D. Vance told Europe’s governments at the 2025 Munich conference that they pose a greater threat to their own societies than Russia or China do. We spoke just before Secretary of State Marco Rubio addressed this year’s conference, padding the administration’s criticism of Europe with a softer tone. “In a time where politics may get rough in the dialogue, as in J.D. Vance&#39;s speech here last year and President Trump&#39;s speech in Davos, there is some stability in this defense-intelligence layer,” Støre told us.

As for his text exchange with Trump, he said, “I would simply, you know, pay tribute to Trump that he takes messages.” Joe Biden, he said, “never did.”

“I mean, you can access him,” Støre said of Trump, clasping his hands then resting them resolutely on the table before him. “We are leaders, and I appreciate that.”</div>

            <h2>Marco Rubio Doesn’t Get It</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-02-15</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/international/2026/02/marco-rubio-doesnt-get-it/686019/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Marco Rubio offered a more supportive message to Europe at the Munich Security Conference yesterday than J. D. Vance did a year ago. Wolfgang Ischinger, the chair of the conference, thanked him for the message of reassurance, adding, “I’m not sure you heard the sigh of relief in this hall.” This despite the fact that Rubio, like Vance, clearly misunderstands Europe and is in denial about the threats facing the United States and the transatlantic alliance.

In 2025, Vance said that the threat he worried the most about for Europe is not Russia, China, or any other external actor. It was the “threat from within,” particularly perceived restrictions on free speech. Vance’s attack landed like a bombshell in Europe. In the weeks that followed, Vance’s role in the Oval Office showdown with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and the Signalgate leak (in which he wrote “I just hate bailing Europe out again”) reinforced his reputation as Europe’s strongest critic in the Trump administration.

Serving as the administration’s more diplomatic good cop, Rubio used his time at Munich to emphasize ties between Europe and the United States. He told the audience: “We want allies who are proud of their culture and of their heritage, who understand that we are heirs to the same great and noble civilization, and who, together with us, are willing and able to defend it.” Further emphasizing unity and shared purpose, he added, “We will always be a child of Europe.”

Rubio also tried to contextualize President Trump’s “direct” approach as part of the noble “task of renewal and restoration,” essential for both the alliance and for Europeans themselves. “We in America have no interest in being polite and orderly caretakers of the West’s managed decline,” Rubio declared. Europe, he explained, had too much faith in open borders and international institutions when the only true defense of the world order is hard power—and the military investment that demands.

This story about Trump rescuing Europe from its short-sighted pacifism and general malaise is one you hear regularly, including from Europeans such as NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte, but it’s not true. Consider the following.

On defense, Europe has been rearming rapidly over the past decade. Non-U.S. NATO members increased their defense spending by $70 billion a year during the first Trump administration, then by $190 billion in the Biden administration. The steep rise was largely in response to the growing threat from Russia, but it indicates that Europeans were seriously investing in their own defense well before Trump’s reelection.

It would be similarly wrong to claim that Europeans have outsourced Ukraine’s defense to the United States, given that Europe has been the biggest provider of aid to the country, allocating more than 132 billion euros from January 2022 to December 2024, compared with 114 billion euros from the U.S., according to the Kiel Institute for the World Economy. Europe’s contribution has grown since Trump took office again, and U.S. aid flatlined.

Even before Trump returned to power, the European Union’s asylum policy had shifted toward tighter border controls, faster processing, and a growing effort to assess asylum claims before allowing migrants in. The EU had also begun “de-risking” the economies of member nations by limiting Chinese investment, backing American export controls on advanced chip-making equipment to China, and reducing dependence on Chinese supply chains.

But the real problem was not what Rubio got wrong about Europe. It was what he chose not to say at all.

The big geopolitical story of this moment, other than Trump, is the increasing alignment and cooperation between Russia, China, and North Korea. Beijing and Pyongyang are now actively involved in a major war in Europe. China is helping Russia reconstitute its military and North Korea has sent weapons and troops. Russia has returned the favor by offering valuable military technology and know-how to both countries. Senior U.S. military and political officials have told me that they are particularly worried about North Korea’s cooperation with Russia and what it means for peace on the Korean peninsula.

This authoritarian alignment is the most profound threat that the United States and its allies, in Europe and the Indo-Pacific, face. Yet there was no mention of Russia or China in Rubio’s speech. He touched on both in the questions and answers but did not characterize them as strategic competitors or a threat to the alliance. This seems to be part of a pattern for the administration. In January, Undersecretary of Defense for Policy Elbridge Colby gave a major speech in South Korea without ever mentioning North Korea. It’s like something out of Harry Potter—the threat cannot be named.

More perniciously, the Trump administration wants to readmit Russia to the G7 and has asked Russia and China to join Trump’s Board of Peace (Russian leader Vladimir Putin said yes, China said no). Meanwhile, Trump officials have seemed keen to alienate the EU and dismiss the “rules-based order” as nothing more than “cloud castle abstractions,” despite the fact that these are the very allies and ideals that the U.S. needs to compete with China and contain Russia.

Before arriving in Munich, Rubio told the press that “the old world is gone” and that “we live in a new era in geopolitics.” He is right, but he misunderstands why. The old order is fraying not because Europe is weak or complacent or guilelessly reliant on diplomatic institutions, but because authoritarian powers are increasingly willing to work together to forcefully reshape the world order. In this landscape, cohesive alliances, military deterrence, and economic resilience are essential.

By devoting his speech to the perceived shortcomings of America’s friends instead of the threats posed by the country’s adversaries, Rubio revealed not only the Trump administration’s flawed diagnosis of this geopolitical moment but its dangerously naive strategy for managing what is becoming—thanks largely to Trump—a treacherously multipolar world.</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">For the first time, speech has been decoupled from consequence. We now live alongside AI systems that converse knowledgeably and persuasively—deploying claims about the world, explanations, advice, encouragement, apologies, and promises—while bearing no vulnerability for what they say. Millions of people already rely on chatbots powered by large language models, and have integrated these synthetic interlocutors into their personal and professional lives. An LLM’s words shape our beliefs, decisions, and actions, yet no speaker stands behind them.

This dynamic is already familiar in everyday use. A chatbot gets something wrong. When corrected, it apologizes and changes its answer. When corrected again, it apologizes again—sometimes reversing its position entirely. What unsettles users is not just that the system lacks beliefs but that it keeps apologizing as if it had any. The words sound responsible, yet they are empty.

This interaction exposes the conditions that make it possible to hold one another to our words. When language that sounds intentional, personal, and binding can be produced at scale by a speaker who bears no consequence, the expectations listeners are entitled to hold of a speaker begin to erode. Promises lose force. Apologies become performative. Advice carries authority without liability. Over time, we are trained—quietly but pervasively—to accept words without ownership and meaning without accountability. When fluent speech without responsibility becomes normal, it does not merely change how language is produced; it changes what it means to be human.

This is not just a technical novelty but a shift in the moral structure of language. People have always used words to deceive, manipulate, and harm. What is new is the routine production of speech that carries the form of intention and commitment without any corresponding agent who can be held to account. This erodes the conditions of human dignity, and this shift is arriving faster than our capacity to understand it, outpacing the norms that ordinarily govern meaningful speech—personal, communal, organizational, and institutional.

Language has always been more than the transmission of information. When humans speak, our words commit us in an implicit social contract. They expose us to judgment, retaliation, shame, and responsibility. To mean what we say is to risk something.

The AI researcher Andrej Karpathy has likened LLMs to human ghosts. They are software that can be copied, forked, merged, and deleted. They are not individuated. The ordinary forces that tether speech to consequence—social sanction, legal penalty, reputational loss—presuppose a continuous agent whose future can be made worse by what they say. With LLMs, there is no such locus. No body that can be confined or restrained; no social or institutional standing to revoke; no reputation to damage. They cannot, in any meaningful sense, bear loss for their words. When the speaker is an LLM, the human stakes that ordinarily anchor speech have nowhere to attach.

I came to understand this gap most clearly through my own work on language learning and development. For years, including during my doctoral research and time as an assistant professor, I worked to build robotic systems that learned word meanings by grounding language in sensory and motor experience. I also developed computational models of child language learning and applied them to my own son’s early development, predicting which words he would learn first from the visual structure of his everyday world. That work was driven by a single aim: to understand how words come to mean something in relation to the world.

Looking back, my work overlooked something. Grounding words in bodies and environments captures only a thin slice of meaning. It misses the moral dimension of language—the fact that speakers are vulnerable, dependent, and answerable; that words bind because they are spoken by agents who can be hurt and held to account. That became impossible to ignore as my son grew—not as a word-learner to be modeled but as a fragile human being whose words mattered because his life did. Meaning arises not from fluency or embodiment alone, but from the social and moral stakes we enter into when we speak. And even if AI reaches the point where it is infallible—and there’s no reason to believe it will, even as accuracy improves—the fundamental problem is that no amount of truthfulness, alignment, or behavioral tuning can resolve the issues that accompany a system that speaks without anyone being responsible for what it says.

Another way to think about all of this is through the relationship between language and dignity. Dignity depends on whether words carry real stakes. When language is mediated by LLMs, several ordinary conditions for dignity begin to fail. Dignity depends, first, on speaking in one&#39;s own voice—not merely being heard, but recognizing oneself in what one says. Dignity also depends on continuity. Human speech accumulates across a life. A person’s character accrues through the things they say and do over time. We cannot reset our histories or escape the aftermath of our promises, apologies, or other pronouncements. These acts matter because the speaker remains present to bear what follows.

Closely tied to dignity is responsibility. In human speech, responsibility is not a single obligation but one’s accountability to a multitude of obligations that accumulate gradually. To speak is simultaneously to invite moral judgment, to incur social and sometimes legal consequences, to take responsibility for truth, and to enter into obligations that persist within ongoing relationships. These dimensions normally cohere in the speaker, which binds a person to their words.

These ordinary conditions make it possible to hold one another to our words: that speech is owned, that it exposes the speaker to loss, and that it accumulates across a continuous life.

LLMs disrupt all of these assumptions. They enable speech that succeeds procedurally while responsibility fails to attach in any clear way. There is no speaker who can be blamed or praised, no individual agent who can repair or repent. Causal chains grow opaque. Liability diffuses. Epistemic authority is performed without obligation. Relational commitments are simulated without persistence.

The result is not merely confusion about who is responsible but a gradual weakening of the expectations that make responsibility meaningful at all.

Pioneers in early automation anticipated all of this during the emergence of artificial intelligence. In the aftermath of World War II, the mathematician and MIT professor Norbert Wiener, the founder of cybernetics, became deeply concerned with the moral consequences of self-directed machines. Wiener had helped design feedback-controlled antiaircraft missiles, machines capable of tracking targets by adjusting their behavior autonomously. These were among the first machines whose actions appeared purposeful to an observer. They did not merely move; they pursued goals. And they killed people.

From this work, Wiener drew two warnings that now read as prophecy. The first was that increasing machine capability would displace human responsibility. As systems act more autonomously and with greater speed, humans would be tempted to abdicate decision making in order to leverage their power. The second warning was subtler and more disturbing: that efficiency itself would erode human dignity. As automated systems optimize for speed, scale, and precision, humans would be pressured to adapt themselves to the machine—to become inputs, operators, or supervisors of processes whose logic they no longer control, and to be subjected to decisions made about their lives by machines.

In his 1950 book, The Human Use of Human Beings, Wiener foresaw learning machines whose internal values would become opaque even to their creators, leading to what today we call the “AI alignment problem.” To surrender responsibility to such systems, he wrote, was “to cast it to the winds and find it coming back seated on the whirlwind.” He understood that the danger was not simply that machines might act wrongly but that humans would abdicate judgment in the name of efficiency—and, in doing so, diminish themselves.

What makes such systems morally destabilizing is not that they malfunction but that they can function exactly as intended while evading responsibility for their actions. As AI capability increases and human oversight recedes, outcomes can be produced for which no one stands fully answerable. The machine performs. The result happens. But obligation does not clearly land anywhere.

The danger that Wiener identified did not depend on weapons. It arose from a deeper feature of cybernetic systems: the use of feedback from a machine’s environment to optimize behavior without human judgment at each step. That same optimization logic—learn from error, improve performance, repeat—now animates systems that speak.

While the appearance of autonomous agency is new, the large-scale transformation of speech is not. Modern history is full of media technologies that have altered how speech circulates: the printing press, radio, television, social media. But each of these lacked properties that today’s AI systems possess simultaneously. They did not converse. They did not, in real time, generate personalized, open-ended content. And they did not convincingly appear to understand. LLMs do all three.

The psychological vulnerability this creates was encountered decades ago in a far humbler system. In 1966, the MIT professor Joseph Weizenbaum built the world’s first chatbot, a simple program called ELIZA. It had no understanding of language at all, and relied instead on simple pattern matching to trigger scripted responses. Yet when Weizenbaum’s secretary began interacting with it, she soon asked him to leave the room. She wanted privacy. She felt like she was speaking to something that understood her.

Weizenbaum was alarmed. He realized that people were not merely impressed by ELIZA’s fluency; they were projecting meaning, intention, and accountability onto the machine. They assumed the machine both understood what it was saying and stood behind its words. This was false on both counts. But the illusion was enough.

Using words meaningfully requires two things. The first is linguistic competence: understanding how words relate to one another and to the world, how to sequence them to form utterances, and how to deploy them to make statements, requests, promises, apologies, claims, and myriad other expressions. Philosophers call these “speech acts.” The second is accountability. ELIZA had neither understanding nor accountability, yet users projected both.

Large language models now exhibit extraordinary linguistic competence while remaining wholly incapable of accountability. That asymmetry makes the projection that Weizenbaum observed not weaker but stronger: Fluent speech reliably triggers the expectation of responsibility, even when no answerability exists.

One can reasonably debate what genuine understanding consists in, and LLMs are obviously constructed differently from human minds. But the question here is not whether these systems understand as humans do. Airplanes really fly, even though they do not flap their wings like birds; what matters is not how flight is achieved but that it is achieved. Likewise, LLMs now demonstrably achieve forms of linguistic competence that match or exceed human performance across many domains. Dismissing them as mere “stochastic parrots” or as just “next-word prediction” mistakes mechanism for emergent function and fails to reckon with what is actually happening: fluent language use at a level that reliably elicits social, moral, and interpersonal expectations.

Why this matters becomes clear in the work of the philosopher J. L. Austin, who argued that to use language is to act. Every meaningful utterance does something: It asserts a belief, makes a claim, issues a request, offers a promise, and so on. Saying “I do” in a wedding ceremony brings into being the act of marriage. In such cases, the act is not carried out by words and then described; it is performed in the act of saying the words under the appropriate conditions.

Austin then drew a crucial distinction about how speech acts can fail. Some utterances are misfires: The act never occurs because the conditions or procedures are broken—as when someone says “I do” not at a wedding. Others are abuses: The act succeeds but is hollow—performed without sincerity, intention, or follow-through. LLMs give rise to this type of failure often. Chatbots do not fail to apologize, advise, persuade, or reassure. They do these things fluently, appropriately, and convincingly. The failure is moral, not procedural. These models systematically produce successful speech acts detached from obligation.

A common counterargument is to insist that chatbots clearly disclose that they are not human. But this misunderstands the nature of the problem. In practice, fluent dialogue quickly overwhelms reflective distance. As with ELIZA, users know they are interacting with a machine, yet they find themselves responding as if a speaker stands behind the words. What has changed is not human susceptibility but machine competence. Today’s models demonstrate linguistic fluency, contextual awareness, and knowledge at a level that is difficult to distinguish from human interlocutors, and in many settings exceeds it. As these systems are paired with ever more realistic animated avatars—faces, voices, and gestures rendered in real time—the projection of agency will only intensify. Under these conditions, reminders of nonhumanness cannot reliably prevent the attribution of understanding, intention, and accountability. The ELIZA effect is not mitigated by disclosure; it is amplified by fluency.

What once required effort, time, and personal investment can now be produced instantly, privately, and endlessly. When a system can draft an essay, apologize for a mistake, offer emotional reassurance, or generate persuasive arguments faster and better than a human can, the temptation to delegate grows strong. Responsibility slips quietly from the user to the tool.

This erosion is already visible. A presenter uses a chatbot to generate slides moments before presenting them, then asks their audience to attend to words the presenter has not fully scrutinized or owned. An instructor delivers feedback on a student’s work generated by an AI system rather than formed through understanding. A junior employee is instructed to use AI to produce work faster, despite knowing the result is inferior to what they could author themselves. In each case, the output may be effective. The loss is not accuracy but dignity.

In private use, the erosion is subtler but no less consequential. Young people describe using chatbots to write messages they feel guilty sending, to outsource thinking they believe they should do themselves, to receive reassurance without exposure, to rehearse apologies that cost them nothing. A chatbot says “I’m sorry” flawlessly yet has no capacity for regret, repair, or change. It admits mistakes without loss. It expresses care without losing anything. It uses the language of care without having anything at risk. These utterances are fluent. And they train users to accept moral language divorced from consequence. The result is a quiet recalibration of norms. Apologies become costless. Responsibility becomes theatrical. Care becomes simulation.

Some argue that accountability can be externalized: to companies, regulations, markets. But responsibility diffuses across developers, deployers, and users, and interaction loops remain private and unobservable. The user bears the consequences; the machine does not.

This is not unlike the ethical problem posed by autonomous weapons. In 2007, the philosopher Robert Sparrow argued that such weapons violate the just-war principle, that when harm is inflicted, someone must be answerable for the decision to inflict it. The programmer is insulated by design, having deliberately built a system whose behavior is meant to unfold without direct control. The commander who deploys the weapon is likewise insulated, unable to govern the weapon&#39;s specific actions once set in motion, and confined to roles designed for its use. And the weapon itself cannot be held responsible, because it lacks any moral standing as an agent. Modern autonomous weapons thus create lethal outcomes for which no responsible party can be meaningfully identified. LLMs operate differently, but the moral logic is the same: They act where humans cannot fully supervise, and responsibility dissolves in the gap.

Speech without enforceable consequence undermines the social contract. Trust, cooperation, and democratic deliberation all rely on the assumption that speakers are bound by what they say.

The response cannot be to abandon these tools. They are powerful and genuinely valuable when used with care. Nor can the response be to pursue ever greater machine capability alone. We need structures that reanchor responsibility: constraints that limit the use of AI in various contexts such as schools and workplaces, and preserve authorship, traceability, and clear liability. Efficiency must be constrained where it corrodes dignity.

As the idea of AI “avatars” enters the public imagination, it is often cast as a democratic advance: systems that know us well enough to speak in our voice, deliberate on our behalf, and spare us the burdens of constant participation. It is easy to imagine this hardening into what might be called an “avatar state”—a polity in which artificial representatives debate, negotiate, and decide for us, efficiently and at scale. But what such a vision forgets is that democracy is not merely the aggregation of preferences. It is a practice of speaking in the open. To speak politically is to risk being wrong, to be answerable, to live with the consequences of what one has said. An avatar state—fluent, tireless, and perfectly malleable—would simulate deliberation but without consequence. It would look, from a distance, like self-government. Up close, it would be something else entirely: responsibility rendered optional, and with it, the dignity of having to stand behind one&#39;s words made obsolete.

Wiener understood that the whirlwind would come not from malevolent machines but from human abdication. Capability displaces responsibility. Efficiency erodes dignity. If we fail to recognize that shift in time, responsibility will return to us only after the damage is done—seated, as Wiener warned, on the whirlwind.</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Back when he was 17 and in high school, Eric Sid fainted. In the emergency room, he was diagnosed with anemia, which can cause fainting spells, and for years he thought that was the end of the story. About a decade later, in the early 2010s, he came down with pneumonia and had blood work done. He took a peek at the results and saw markers of anemia, as he expected. But the report also mentioned that his red blood cells were smaller than normal.

Sid was in medical school at the time, and he immediately thought of a few genetic conditions that could explain this result. One was thalassemia, which causes low levels of hemoglobin, leading to anemia and other related problems. A laboratory test showed that he had this inherited illness. And this meant that he had a gene mutation. Finally, he thought, he had an explanation for symptoms he had been experiencing for years.

Except there was a catch. In the most common forms of thalassemia, people who show symptoms have mutations in both copies of the related genes. Those born with the most severe forms of thalassemia require transfusions for life to get enough healthy red blood cells, and if the condition is not diagnosed soon enough it can be fatal in early childhood. But Sid’s lab results suggested that only one copy was affected, so he was considered a carrier of the illness, who could pass it on to his children but didn’t have it himself. According to conventional wisdom at the time, carriers were asymptomatic, and compared with someone suffering from the disease’s worst manifestations, he seemed fine.

Sid now works on a rare-disease program within the National Institutes of Health. Since he first found out that he was a carrier for thalassemia, he told me, research has shown that people like him can experience health consequences. These include lethargy and fainting—symptoms that hardly capture the disease’s classic presentation but still have real consequences. And thalassemia is not unique. There are hundreds upon hundreds of known disorders for which carriers were thought to be safe; for a growing number of those diseases, doctors and scientists now believe that being a carrier can come with health problems. Plenty of patients have guessed all along that being a carrier could explain mysteries about their health, Sid said. “It took a while for the science to basically catch up to that suspicion.”

In these types of “recessive” conditions, the people who show the classical manifestation of the disease have a pair of mutated genes. Our 23 chromosomes come in pairs that are essentially near duplicates of each other (with the exception of XY pairs). A person with just one nonworking version of a gene was supposed to be protected by the functioning second copy on the matching chromosome, which would provide cover against any disease. Inheriting two mutated copies of a gene is statistically rare, so many families with carriers may not include members with the full-blown version of a disease. As a result, the mutation can be unknowingly passed down from generation to generation, without carriers being aware of the real consequences.

In October, researchers in Louisiana reported on a case involving a college football player who had heart palpitations during practice. The athlete was a carrier for the blood disorder sickle-cell disease—one of the most common genetic disorders in America. Up to 10 percent of Black Americans are carriers for sickle cell. As far back as the 1970s, scientists noted blood and heart complications in carriers following physical exercise, and a lawsuit following the sudden death of a college football player two decades ago led to widespread screening for the sickle-cell trait in university athletics. However, experts are still trying to understand the risks to carriers.

The Louisiana man survived, but researchers noted that he had a dangerously irregular heartbeat during training and would need cardiac surgery. The authors of the October paper stress that coaches and players need more education about the possible hazards for carriers of the sick-cell trait.

Experts who study cystic fibrosis, which is caused by mutations in the CFTR gene, also want more attention on the health complications that carriers can experience. As many as one in 25 Americans of European descent is a carrier for cystic fibrosis, but many are not aware of their status. For this disease, reports of symptoms in carriers go back at least several decades. Take, for example, infertility. Almost all men who have two mutated copies of the CFTR gene lack vas deferens, and without these tubes, sperm have no path out of the testes. In the mid-’90s, scientists found a handful of cystic-fibrosis carriers who lacked vas deferens, despite only one of their CFTR copies being mutated.

Carriers of cystic fibrosis can face other real health issues—dramatic sinus problems requiring multiple surgeries, pancreatitis, and possibly pancreatic cancer, which researchers have documented in papers over the past several years. “We’ve always said being a carrier of a single cystic-fibrosis mutation doesn’t usually lead to health issues. And usually it doesn’t,” Michael Boyle, the president and CEO of the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation, told me. “However, we do know, and probably have a greater appreciation than ever, that being a carrier can lead to health issues for some.” There are about 10 million cystic-fibrosis carriers in the United States alone, so if even a fraction of them have some degree of symptoms, that amounts to many people with manifestations of the disease.

Questions about carriers’ health problems go beyond well-known diseases such as sickle cell and cystic fibrosis. Consider xeroderma pigmentosum: People with two mutated gene copies are up to 2,000 times more likely to develop melanoma than the average person; a 2023 analysis found strong evidence that some carriers of the disease were also more likely to develop skin cancer. Up to 3 percent of carriers of hereditary hemochromatosis show symptoms such as iron overload in their organs. Carriers of Gaucher disease Type 1 are at increased risk of Parkinson’s. Carriers of LIG4 syndrome experience a version of the immunodeficiency that, in the fully expressed syndrome, causes life-threatening illness.

For many of these diseases, having two mutated copies of the related gene generally means that the disease will come for you. Having one copy can still mean nothing: Plenty of carriers of recessive genetic diseases seem none the worse for it. An estimated one in 20 people is, like Sid, a carrier for thalassemia, but not all people with a copy of the mutation experience anemia and fainting like he did. Why some carriers of genetic illnesses might be affected and others remain free from symptoms is not clear. But “people who are thought to be just carriers but show some symptoms of that disease may sometimes have a second hard-to-discover mutation,” Edward Neilan, the chief medical and scientific officer of the National Organization for Rare Disorders, told me. “They may actually have two mutations.”

Being a carrier can have benefits. One theory of why genetic diseases spread widely is that having one copy of a mutated gene has some advantage. It’s well understood, for example, that being a carrier for sickle-cell disease offers some protection against malaria. And some have theorized that being a carrier for cystic fibrosis can defend against severe cholera, although the evidence for this theory is more scant. A 2023 analysis discovered that although two variant copies of the SCN5A gene elevates a person’s risk of severe heart-rhythm problems, just one copy actually might lower a person’s risk of heart-rhythm irregularities compared with the general population.

Even when being a carrier of a particular disease isn’t itself beneficial, knowing that you are a carrier can be. Carriers of certain variants of xeroderma pigmentosum, for example, might want to go to extra lengths to avoid excessive sun exposure; some carriers of Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency, who appear to have a heightened risk of lung issues, might decide not to smoke. And people with the sickle-cell trait might be well-advised to acclimatize before doing sports at high altitudes.

Knowing you’re a carrier for cystic fibrosis might help guide your family-planning decisions, for instance. (Even without vas deferens, a person could still become a father using sperm extraction and in vitro fertilization—which some carriers of cystic fibrosis opt for anyway, to avoid passing on the disease.) But there are limits: The science is still out on whether Trikafta, a relatively new medication that has transformed the disease for many people, would help with sinus or pancreatic issues in carriers. The medication isn’t approved for carriers, either.

For Sid, knowing that he had a thalassemia mutation—which can cause dizziness—has made him feel less bad about his difficulty with intensive physical training, for example. And he is comforted to know what likely caused his high-school fainting episode. Finding out about the mutation in his genome gave him a fuller picture of his health. “Personally,” he said, “that’s kind of how I saw it—this kind of gave me some more understanding.”</div>

Apple hardware is currently not overpriced, quite the opposite. That&#39;s because Apple Silicon is really efficient, especially if you take energy consumption into account. Check out the Mac mini for example. I was considering buying a laptop recently and considered the framework laptops, then I saw that the apple laptops are better by most (not all) criteria and also cheaper.

Regardless of pricing, does anyone considering a framework laptop really also consider a Macbook ? The whole point of the Framework is modularity/expandability.  Whereas a Macbook is completely locked down hardware.

I don&#39;t have a preference. No one makes a laptop with a left handed trackball for me. Maybe some day Framework will allow it.

I know several people who have frameworks just because they think itâ(TM)s nice hardware.  The upgradability is just a nice bonus for them.  So yes, they were considering Macs too.

But you have to fight Apple to do anything not authorized by Apple, like run a different OS, or upgrade the hardware in any meaningful way. Even with the current RAM/SSD pricing issues, is the TCO better? Apple charges a lot for upgrades and they can only be bought up front, so no adding some cheap RAM and a big SSD five years down the line.

I think we generally agree. Buying a framework laptop means being willing to pay more for modularity, which might translate to cost benefits in the distant future. Considering to buy one is balancing whether it&#39;s worth the price now. What I&#39;m saying is that Apple Silicon is weighing further in that balance. Apple used to be expensive relative to the PC market, at least when disregarding hardware robustness and life expectancy; nowadays I don&#39;t think it&#39;s still true. Which is why I disagreed with OP saying i

Wow. You live in the past. Macs are now probably the best in both performance and performance/price. This is from someone who, despite having to work on them, would never spend any of their own money on a Mac before the M1 came out. I would still not suggest Apple hardware though for those who don&#39;t want to use MacOS.

But I am very puzzled about the summary talking about Linux not being ARM ready. I use ARM with Debian on the Cloud for most things as they are the most cost effective. That&#39;s the whole point o

I think the problem in the article is that the people installing Linux on a ARM Mac didn&#39;t set their expectations low enough.

The expectation should have been that of Gentoo, where you install everything from source, and never expect an ARM build.Same with the &quot;No external monitor without HDMI&quot;... how else did you expect to cconnect it? USB? DisplayLink is a proprietary standard. HDMI/DP over USB-C? Ask Nintendo why they don&#39;t standardize that either. You likely need in a Mac connect a real USB-C or TB docki

The few cases Iâ(TM)ve met for this are closed source software someone wants to run like the Minecraft server for example (which is a shame, because it needs single core performance where Appleâ(TM)s CPUs excel).  The best way to deal with that on an AppleSilicon Mac is to run Linux in a VM on top of Appleâ(TM)s virtualisation framework.  Then you can use Rosetta to run it.

I would probably run Linux if I had the time to set it up on my gaming PC as gaming is all I use it for these days.But since running Windows 11, I have migrated back to MacOS, I can run all the tools I need for my work. SSH, web brower based tools, Office 365 that customers use to communicate(incl Teams), Teamviewer etc etc.Windows is a mess and I swapped back to Mac. If it wasn&#39;t because i work 12 hours a day, I would probably start checking Linux as a desktop again.

Yeh, except that at least at the moment, Macs are the cheepest things out there.  Even their normally exorbitant memory prices are âoereasonableâ just now because PC RAM prices have gone so nuts.

And useful if you want to dual boot something other than windows, but if all you want is a version if *nix just stick with MacOS. It has its quirks and the use of objective C for a lot of system calls is royal PITA if you&#39;re a C/C++ dev like me, but other than that it has little benefit over linux if you just want a nix enviroment and I write as someone who uses and develops on both in a daily basis.

I admin a bunch of Linux servers and workstations, and my daily driver for that has been a Mac. Admittedly mine is a simpler use case than what you&#39;re doing - I mean, mostly I just need a terminal, python to run ansible, ssh, and I like bbedit for editing - but macOS works as well as Linux for my particular use case.

My biggest complaint is - I feel like Apple&#39;s software quality has been gradually trending downhill over the past decade or more. The hardware engineering is still first-rate, but the OS and Apple-developed tools are just &#39;meh&#39; at best. Some of the Tahoe bugs, even at 26.3, are absurd... which is why I&#39;m sticking w/ Sonoma as long as it gets support.

But as to the actual topic: The Asahi folks are quite clear regarding what works and what doesn&#39;t work, and with which Apple processors. None of that should&#39;ve been a surprise for the author, IMHO.

Tried it a year ago, tried it again recently. Even on an M1 macbook, hardware still isn&#39;t supported or is poorly supported. Performance is poor, battery life is bad, you can&#39;t use all the hardware. You&#39;re much better served by selling it and buying a cheaper laptop with full Linux support.

&#39;I Tried Running Linux On an Apple Silicon Mac and Regretted It&#39;

The difficulties described are consequences of Apple’s proprietary platform design, not evidence that Linux or ARM are immature ecosystems. Conflating ISA compatibility with platform openness is a fundamental misunderstanding of how hardware enablement works.

“Linux doesn’t feel ready for ARM yet. Many apps aren’t compiled for ARM.”

This is the weakest argument in the article.

Billions of Android devices (Linux kernel)Most cloud hyperscalers (Graviton, Ampere)Raspberry Pi ecosystemEmbedded and industrial systemsMajor distros eg:Fedora, Ubuntu, Debian have mature AArch64 support.

And today most open-source software compiles cleanly for ARM64.Browsers, compilers, containers, dev tools are fully native.Even Steam supports ARM via translation layers.

The real issue is x86-only proprietary binaries.

That’s not Linux-on-ARM immaturity.That’s legacy x86 ecosystem inertia.

Even Apple solves this via Rosetta — a translation layer.Linux uses FEX or box64 for similar purposes.

Translation instability  platform immaturity.

Think about how people actually want to use their computers. They want to be able to play Steam games, for example. They want to be able to run a few apps under WINE maybe, or some commercial software that is only distributed as a binary. Even some of the open source stuff can have issues on ARM, as I have found with embedded Raspberry Pi stuff.

Whatever the reason, whoever is to blame, the bottom line for the user is that stuff doesn&#39;t work.

Linux can be good with older 2nd hand Macs.

In 2017 a friend was throwing away their 2007 iMac (an Intel-based computer-in-a-monitor model). I installed Ubuntu on it and used it for a while as a home desktop computer - nothing too heavy. I liked using Ubuntu on what felt like a solid, well designed computer.

...and need binary components for certain popular packages (database connectors, system-level bindings, etc.). They either don&#39;t exist or you&#39;ve got to build them from scratch just to realise that you can&#39;t because they don&#39;t support arm.

....It just isn&#39;t ready for ARM-powered Macs, perhaps. ARM-based systems aren&#39;t tied to standards to the same degree x86 systems are. Thus one has to be more careful and ensure their hardware is supported. It&#39;s like Linux back in the mid-&#39;90s on Intel.

&quot;External monitors don&#39;t work unless your MacBook has a built-in HDMI port.&quot;

That means I can use a Thunderbolt-attached monitor with my MBP that has an HDMI port, right?  What, no, it really means &quot;External monitors only work via built-in HDMI port&quot; and &quot;This article was written poorly&quot;?  I am shocked, shocked.

Here&#39;s one case where the answer to a question in the headline certainly isn&#39;t &quot;no&quot;.

Especially if you remove the word &quot;effective&quot;.

Especially if you remove the word &quot;effective&quot;.And add the words &quot;useless&quot; and &quot;garbage&quot;.

Especially if you remove the word &quot;effective&quot;.

And add the words &quot;useless&quot; and &quot;garbage&quot;.

That will be superfluous, there&#39;s already &#39;advertisement&#39; there :)

Effective ads is already an impossibility.AI effective is just mind blowingly impossible.they can make ads for other AIs, yes, but that would not be called an ad.

It would be hilarious if AI agents led advertising clients to discover that ads rarely actually get people to buy enough things to justify the cost of the ad.And the entire advertising echosystem collapses. Won&#39;t happen, but would be funny.

Let&#39;s say you&#39;re starting a new business - say, an online webstore, offering something with an extra particular appeal to some particular group vs. their preexisting options.  Precisely zero people know about your webstore.  What exactly is your plan without some form of advertising - just hope that people randomly stumble into it and tell all their friends?

To be clear, advertising doesn&#39;t just mean &quot;banner ads&quot;, it can be all sorts of things. Maybe you give a Youtube influencer who makes videos on subjects

[...] a Google executive mocked OpenAI, adding that Google had no plans to show ads inside its Gemini chatbot. What he didn&#39;t mention, however, was that Google, whose profits are largely derived from online ads, shows advertising on Google.com based on user interactions with the AI chatbot built into its search engine.What percentage of news stories these days is about hypocrisy of some sort?

we don&#39;t want effective ads.We don&#39;t want ads at all.

Then be ready to pay for the content you&#39;re consuming.

Every advancement put forth by Big Tech ever since the dotcom boom has been about advertising and marketing. Their goal is to optimize personalized mattress sales.

Their actual goal is to profit from consumer surplus.

This is a simple rule to live by - if you see advertising, start by assuming you don&#39;t need it.  If it&#39;s for a brand, assume that brand is overcharging you.  If you see product placements or informal/influencer content, assume that&#39;s a paid advertisement.  Think very carefully about what you need, make a shopping list and monitor the prices, so you know when to buy (and give yourself a cooldown to avoid impulse buying - if you haven&#39;t needed it while waiting for a special, maybe you don&#39;t need it at all).

not only a good idea. It&#39;s a necessity from the IT security point of view.

Why no use adblock ?Don&#39;t waste your time on ads.

Advertisers have moved away from tracking everyone ?   I believe that as much as a believe the content of their ad copy.

Searches are increased because of AI  ?  Yes, because they are using AI to make searching more difficult.

You&#39;re telling me that now companies are trying to sell people things that they might want to buy? Oh noes! How horrible!

And on top of it all, statistically-generated misinformation.

Nobody can find *hit on the first search, so they have to click again. You are sucked into clicking on &quot;classic search&quot;, &quot;people also ask&quot;, &quot;click here to open&quot;, to try to get away from Google Spam and all that then counts as two searches for Google.

When are people going to figure out that, while AI can be useful, it needs significant oversight - oversight performed by people who know what they&#39;re doing?

Quit believing what you&#39;re told by the tech bros who are trying to build a fortune on top of &quot;AI&quot;!

Okay, but I&#39;m not sure that it rises to the level of interesting. But Slashdot doesn&#39;t have any dimension of moderation that encourages solutions, my ongoing focus.

So here&#39;s my solution in the form of an attempted joke: Alien style. That&#39;s the unpeople from outer space, not human foreigners.

So first we train the generative AIs for the style of aliens, and then we require them to talk that way. It would always be clear (IOttMCO) when an AI was talking.

And a top of the klaatu barada nikto to you, too.

The problem is in cases like this where &quot;oversight&quot; would have taken just as much time as not using the AI to begin with.

A lot of coders can save time with AI because oftentimes &quot;checking the work&quot; means running a function. You test it the same way you would had you written it yourself.

But with writing, &quot;checking the work&quot; means doing the research that you were trying to avoid by using an AI. In the example from the article, he tried to use the AI to extract and organize quotes. If he had used the AI to do

It very literally doesn&#39;t.  It is far faster to do &quot;Here&#39;s a giant e-book, find me five quotations from it that relate to the concept of paranoia&quot; and then to do ctrl-f in the e-book and search for the provided wording, than to read the whole damned book and thinking about whether every sentence applies to paranoia.

Also, describing the quotes in context here as &quot;hallucinated&quot; or &quot;fake&quot; is deeply misleading to readers.  The quotes were summarized / paraphrased versions of what was actually said.  The author

The oversight needs to be so significant, that admitting it would almost completely nullify the usefulness and consequently the value of all &quot;investment&quot;.

The trumpistani &quot;journalism&quot; has been feeding from the corporate hand  for a long time and is completely corrupted by it, so you&#39;re not going to see much critical thinking involved in the coverage of the subject. What you&#39;ll see will either be pandering and outright advertising (cf. the many headlines here about the miracle of anthropic this year and the i

The AI overlords will not forget this incident.

The &quot;AI Overloads&quot; don&#39;t give a sh*t.  All they care about is money.

The unfortunate part of the story is that before this story came out, we readers had no way to know ArsTechnica was publishing AI-generated stories.  (In fact, their stated policy was that they did *not* use AI).

What working writers should do is to form a nonprofit organization, create a simple but distinctive banner that declares &quot;This news source is free of AI-generated content&quot;, and then *trademark* the banner so that it can only be used with permission.  Sites that commit to a &quot;no AI&quot; policy get to use the banner free of charge.  Sites that don&#39;t have such a policy don&#39;t get to use it, and sites that are caught lying (like ArsTechnica) get their right to use the banner revoked.

Their Bluesky post adds that they were &quot;working from bed with a fever and very little sleep&quot; after being sick with Covid since at least Monday.So, a person who is listed as &quot;Senior AI Reporter&quot; can&#39;t take a couple of days off when he is sick with Covid, and instead has to &quot;work from bed with a fever and very little sleep&quot;.
 
Gotta keep churning out those stories.  How nice.  Fuck You Ars Technica.

No no. This is bluesky. The covid angst bit was just the boilerplate you need to post on there.

Not sure what Dorsey has to do with Bluesky (he was an important player in its history, but has had nothing to do with it for years, and doesn&#39;t even have an active account there).  TL/DR, he found that most of the people there hated him (and things he&#39;s interested in, like crypto), and regularly got trolled when posting on the site.

If you show up at work sick, you do less, and make more mistakes, but mostly you&#39;ll give your illness to others. You openly cough in the conference room and you get sent home.It is a wee bit of an over reaction but following covid nobody wants to take a chance.

Hell I went to work Friday despite being sick

That just means unscrupulous companies will lie and use AI until they get caught, then be forced to remove the banner, which most people won&#39;t notice anyway.The only way such a scheme actually has a chance of working is if there are much steeper consequences for lying, i.e. sites that are caught lying have to name, shame, and fire the person responsible or get sued into oblivion.

It was not an &quot;AI generated story&quot;.  Even if you can&#39;t be bothered to click the links, can you at least be bothered to read the summary?  It was a human-written article, written by a human who was bedridden with a fever from COVID and feeling miserable. He tried using a Claude tool for verbatim quotes, but Claude refused because of the topic (harassment). So he pasted it into ChatGPT to understand why Claude refused. ChatGPT (correctly) summarized Shambaugh&#39;s article. The sick author mistakenly assumed Chat

It also regrets characterizing feedback as &quot;positive&quot; for a proposal to change a repo&#39;s CSS to Comic Sans for accessibility. (The proposals were later accused of being &quot;coordinated trolling&quot;...)I&#39;m skeptical that this is actually an AI and not in fact a person trolling.  That sounds exactly like what someone would do as a joke.  One of the stranger elements of AI literacy these days is remembering that things claiming to be AI generated sometimes aren&#39;t.  Often it&#39;s really a person just pretending.

In this case Benj Edwards laid down with AI...
 
I think a great deal of the outrage being expressed against ArsTechnica is a manifestation of the pent up rage many of us feel towards the AI slop we&#39;re being force fed from all directions into all of our orifices. That rage will subside, and ArsTechnica will continue. Benj, on the other hand, will likely suffer more than he deserves for his overzealous and often credulous cheerleading of AI. Of all people, he should have understood its limitations.

The Gell-Mann amnesia effect [wikipedia.org] is at full power here.

When a journo fucks up something only you know something about, you still keep on trusting the reporting on stuff you know little about. But when a journo fucks up something obvious that everyone can see is obviously wrong....did the tree really make a sound?

In my experience. Requesting reference links is also useless. Even if provided, they are either 404 or unrelated.

You need to use a separate tool for verification, like a proper search engine.

They&#39;re not fake AI-generated quotes  AI actually generated these.  They&#39;re real AI-generated quotes.

Or did they mean &quot;fake, AI-generated quotes&quot;?  Commas matter.  There are books written about this.

&quot;Lets eat, Grandma!&quot; does indeed have a different meaning than &quot;Lets eat Grandma!&quot;

&quot;Lets eat, Grandma!&quot; does indeed have a different meaning than &quot;Lets eat Grandma!&quot; Agreed [slashdot.org]!

&quot;Lets eat, Grandma!&quot; does indeed have a different meaning than &quot;Lets eat Grandma!&quot;

&quot;...At this time, this appears to be an isolated incident.&quot;

Yes, just one of thousands and thousands of &#39;isolated incidents&#39;. There&#39;s no pattern whatsoever. Don&#39;t worry your pretty little head about it.

And that name should have been in the Slashdot blurb.

Being sorry for something implies feeling. Sorry, datacenters full of chips do not feel. We need to stop talking about these clankers like they are human, and see them for what they are and not the charade they perform.

... I still think that news stories about what actual humans say on social media are stupid. Have thought so ever since that practice started.

Now we have news stories about what AI agents &quot;say&quot; on social media?

Or people have been told for half a century that trickle down, laissez faire capitalism would make us all prosperous. And all the while, Republicans and Democrats have been shaking hands to send our jobs over seas.

Tuition is up, housing is less affordable, and unsecured debt is way up. Opportunities to move up are far fewer than they once were for the working class. The quality of life for the bottom 50% has plummeted while our cities have turned into something worse than the shithole countries we used to i

That&#39;s not how market caps work. If you recall, Amazon didn&#39;t make a profit until its 10th year, and then, it was tiny. Compared to its market cap, that profit was infinitesimally small. This is because in the first decade, Amazon&#39;s investors plowed tons of money into the company to build it up. Since then, their profits have soared, reducing its P/E ratio to about 27x. Rivian&#39;s profits will likewise grow, unless they mismanage the business or calamity strikes, bring the P/E ratio to a more reasonable numbe

It shows they are moving in the right direction, and unlike Tesla it&#39;s not built on a cult of personality or bullshit promises about full self driving appreciating assets. It&#39;s just a solid business with a solid product, making a profit relatively early compared to other startups too.

Rivian&#39;s profits are from their software that VW purchased.Their cars are ranked as the most unreliable cars in the United States, unfortunately.

Rivian isn&#39;t that bad. Consumer Reports counts every minor problem and tallies that up for a reliability score. So the transmission in your Ford can grenade itself and that counts the same as a Rivian having a squeaky dashboard.

If platforms can&#39;t prevent AI slop and disinformation, then I question their need to exist, what value does a giant sack of trash offer?   The fight over what is illegal content should be waged, and then the results of that fight can be passed on to the platforms.  Making tech companies take some responsibility is the only way we might have a somewhat useable internet in a couple years.

The problem always come on how to implement this, and how to do it without having massive authoritarian abuse.

But they are trying, and it needs to be done.

Defrauding investors is something billionares take very seriously. He isn&#39;t going anywhere. You can get away with a lot of crimes, but stealing from the wealthy comes with severe punishment.

Going for funny? I think it&#39;s because SBF is too honest. Michael Lewis wrote a very interesting book about the case...

Translation: The President is now Donald J Trump.

We promise to back FTX2.0 with Trump Coin.

As Trump pardons him, I can hear it now:“He’s been treated very very very very unfairly. Very very unfairly. Some people say more unfairly than anyone. I think worse maybe.  It’s a disgrace. “

Then onto the big-eyed blonde in the black turtleneck with the fake deep voice .

Amazing he finds the money after he figures out he&#39;s not getting out. Interesting you trust criminals.
That&#39;s not how it worked.  When FTX was declared insolvent, its affairs were handed over to an independent party to try to work out what went on, where the money went, and whether they could recoup investor&#39;s funds. By all accounts, FTX and Alameda had very poor or no book-keeping, and it took Some Time for all the various investments and accounts that they had to come to light.

TLDR: It was an independent third party who retrieved the funds that Bankman-Fried said were there all along.

Doing bad accounting isn&#39;t the same as stealing money, is it? He says the money was always there, and apparently it was. If true then where&#39;s the prosecution&#39;s case?

No, it&#39;s not the same as stealing money or committing fraud. It&#39;s also largely irrelevant to my response - it wasn&#39;t SBF suddenly finding the money because he wasn&#39;t getting pardoned, it was out of his hands by then.

An answer to your question is that if he broke the law but creditors didn&#39;t miss out because the underlying crypto rose hugely in value, he still broke the law.  The legal system rarely works on the &quot;no harm, no foul&quot;  law.  You don&#39;t avoid a speeding ticket simply because you weren&#39;t involved

They lost a lot of unrealized gains.SBF, a real toad, isn&#39;t wrong to lay this at the cops&#39; feet since they are the ones who set the valuation date. 

But it&#39;s also true that this is a bit like Ponzi scheme insiders crying about not cashing out when they had the chance.

That happened to the universe since Noah flooding. Because of the Donald. His crazy tariff policies have already precipitated the whole world into the abyss. It&#39;s very very very unfair for China and now everybody rightfully hates America like everybody should be.

Trump&#39;s goal here along with the tariffs is to create a national sales tax so that he can eliminate his tax burden and the tax burden of his buddies. As a percentage is still much much much less than you pay but because they have about 60% of all th

We’re coming up on a big national anniversary, the (defiantly unspellable) semiquincentennial. To get in the spirit of things, I’ve been curled up with books about the founders, particularly George Washington, someone I became acquainted with when I wrote a book about him many years ago. But meanwhile, our current president has been honking away in the distance—a man difficult to abide and impossible to ignore.

Despite the glaring differences between Washington and Donald Trump in character, judgment, and historical significance, there are some interesting similarities. Born rich. Aggressive acquirers of real estate. Big-house guys. Thin-skinned, image-conscious. Extremely nationalistic: Trump’s message is Make America Great Again. Washington’s was … Make America.

So why will history judge them as polar opposites? In part because Washington readily and repeatedly gave up power. He did so conspicuously at the end of the War of Independence, then again after eight years as president. He lived in an era in which selflessness was considered one of the core virtues of a great leader, and at crucial moments in our history, he behaved accordingly.

Whereas Trump … well, he’s no George Washington. And he tells us so! He is instinctively royalist and brazenly self-aggrandizing. He repeatedly claims powers he does not legally have. He promiscuously puts his name on everything this side of the moon, and I probably shouldn’t even mention that particular satellite, lest he get ideas.

His decision to appoint himself as chair of the Kennedy Center was outrageous enough, but then he put his name on the place. He also put his name on the United States Institute of Peace, just a few blocks away. His face is all over D.C. now, on huge banners hanging from government buildings. He wants Dulles International Airport named for him, and also Penn Station. His open campaigning for the Nobel Peace Prize was plenty dismaying, but then he threw one of his tantrums when he didn’t get laureated and, in an official letter to the leader of Norway, demanded Greenland in compensation. At this point, we know that Trump is going to be Trump, and if anything, he leans into the narcissism, becoming Trumpier by the day. Trump has learned that his most flamboyantly selfish behavior will likely be ignored or forgiven by his base and political allies. There is no one willing to tell him that You Can’t Do This.

Our nation was founded upon the principle that power derives from the people. We don’t like despots and dictators and monarchs or anything smacking of royalty. That was why the founders were very careful when they crafted the Constitution: The president is just one branch of government, is constrained by checks and balances, and can always be given the heave-ho.

Which takes us back to George Washington. Everyone knew he was going to be the first president—he was right there in the room, presiding, when the founders drew up the Constitution. But they were taking a chance, because no one really knew what a president was. Such a thing didn’t exist anywhere in the world. George Washington had to define the role through his actions.

What modern historians know is that selflessness didn’t come effortlessly to Washington. He had to will it, in tension with his natural, human desires.

This is a subtlety of Washington that Americans weren’t taught in elementary school, and I don’t think the A.I. bots have quite figured it out. A schoolkid asking an A.I. program for help with an essay about Washington will probably get highlights of the man’s consequential life, the first-in-war, first-in-peace stuff, and perhaps learn that he was an enslaver who, like the other founders, failed to end the vile institution of human bondage. But the child is unlikely to find out what Washington was really like. Here’s what ChatGPT produced when I asked it to “write an essay on George Washington’s personality”:

George Washington was a man of great integrity, character, and leadership. His personality was marked by a strong sense of duty, humility, and selflessness. … Despite his many accomplishments and successes, he remained humble and never sought accolades or praise for himself.

Oh, balderdash. Yes, Washington was indeed a man of integrity, character, and leadership. That led him to behave selflessly at critical moments during the founding of our country. But Washington desperately wanted to be a great man, and wanted to be remembered as such. He craved the approbation (one of his favorite words) of his peers and guarded his image as though it were the front line of a war. He sought, as multiple biographers have put it, “secular immortality.”

He didn’t wander into greatness: he pursued it, willed it, achieved it. He had a “monumental ego,” in the words of historian Joseph Ellis. Peter Henriques, an admirer of Washington who has recently published two insightful books on his character, writes that Washington “was not a ‘selfless’ man or one who was simply engaging in disinterested service. Rather, a pattern emerges of a man who was deeply ambitious, massively concerned with his reputation, and in regular search of the public approbation, even as he denied such desires.” This is not revisionist history. This is the man as he really was. Washington is so tied up with the narrative of American greatness and exceptionalism that some people may think it’s wrong to probe him too deeply. Why not just salute and move on? As Alexis Coe put it in her recent biography, “We haven’t been taught to think critically about Washington.”

His avaricious acquisitions of western lands is well known and not incidental to his desire to break from Great Britain, which had tried to limit western migration. When I wrote my book The Grand Idea, about Washington and his Potomac River schemes (he thought it would surely be the great commercial highway to the West), I was a bit shocked at his imperious behavior when he traveled across the mountains into what is now western Pennsylvania and confronted poor farmers who (he alleged) were squatting on his land. He sued them. He forced them to pull up stakes. He could be pretty high-and-mighty, and certainly not exactly a small-d democrat.

And yet his drive, his ambition, his hunger for glory were essential to the enterprise of wresting the colonies from the grip of distant overlords. And his desire for secular immortality didn’t mean he was pretending to have lofty republican sensibilities. He was anti-monarchical to the core.

Washington curated his reputation and polished it for the eyes of future generations. Shortly before his death, he wrote a will that broke apart his vast estate, including more than 50,000 acres of land, and set in motion the freeing of the enslaved people under his legal control (delaying manumission until the death of his wife). These were actions very consciously taken with the eyes of history upon him. He knew that slavery would be a permanent stain on his reputation. And he was right.

Early biographers helped advance the image of a godlike Washington. Most famously, Parson Weems invented from whole cloth the story about young Washington taking a hatchet to his father’s cherry tree, then confessing to it. The early chroniclers, including John Marshall (who fought under Washington’s command and later served as chief justice of the United States), delivered to the public the kind of man that the fragile young nation desired: an unblemished father figure, preposterously virtuous.

Go the Capitol rotunda and look up at the dome, where Constantino Brumidi’s fresco The Apotheosis of Washington, painted during the Civil War, shows Washington in heaven, flanked by goddesses. You have to strain to see him, way up there, high above this mortal coil. He’s a remote figure, unapproachable. Not like us.

Washington cared a lot about appearances and made sure that he presented himself as a formidable, dignified figure, not someone you’d slap on the back on a whim. He liked a bit of pomp and pizzazz as president. He was meticulous in ordering well-made clothes, and a “chariot” with some gilding wouldn’t be too excessive, he thought. But he had to be careful. If he acted too much like royalty, he’d get spanked by his peers and excoriated by anti-Federalist newspapers. “No Kings” was not just a protest sign in those days.

Human nature has not changed. There have always been people who desire wealth and power. They are never infallible or immune to misjudgment. What changes and evolves are the political ecosystems. Laws change, as do values, societal expectations, the means of communication, the technologies of political life. The norms. Norms can erode.

Trump, the opposite of an enigma, constantly tells us exactly who he is. He reveals this in late-night social media rants (“SEDITIOUS BEHAVIOR, punishable by DEATH!”) and unguarded conversations caught on tape (“When you’re a star, they let you do it” and “I just want to find 11,780 votes”).

He is at least consistent in his message. He tells us, over and over, This is all about me. So of course when Rob Reiner and his wife were murdered, Trump immediately said the killings were linked to Reiner’s political opposition to him. His solipsism is nonnegotiable.

Historians will have an overwhelming job of compiling and organizing the confetti of royalist declarations from this president, but let’s simplify their work a bit. The most important moment, the defining one, is obvious: Trump refused to accept that he lost the 2020 election and—another example of action defining character—urged the vice president and an unruly mob to halt the peaceful transfer of power. That’s as un–George Washington as it gets. Washington knew he was part of something bigger than himself. He had helped create a nation, but it didn’t belong to him. So after eight years fashioning the office of the presidency, he did something simple and exemplary: He went home.

            <div id="article-text">Sign up for the Surge, the newsletter that covers most important political nonsense of the week, delivered to your inbox every Saturday.

Welcome to this week’s edition of the Surge, a newsletter that never once had lunch on Jeffrey Epstein’s island. [Epstein file comes out.] Oh, come on, that was a brunch.

We’ve got it all this week: Epstein. The Kennedys. Bridge scandals involving new bridges and rival bridge owners. Democratic mega-gerrymanders. TARIFF VOTES.

But the concept of this edition—in the Sgt. Pepper’s sense of a “concept,” in that it ends after a couple of tracks—is the audience of one, and how some Trump administration appointees will almost intentionally do their jobs badly to stay in the boss’s good graces. Unusual dynamic. Cheers!

On Tuesday, prosecutors with the U.S. attorney’s office in the District of Columbia, led by Jeanine Pirro, sought and failed to indict six Democratic lawmakers—four House members and two senators—who recorded a social media video last year in which they reminded service members of their obligation to refuse illegal orders. What were the exact charges? Who knows. Whatever they were, the grand jury in D.C. didn’t just reject them as a body. As NBC News reported, zero members of the grand jury found the charges up to snuff. Separately, a judge this week smacked down Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth’s attempt to punish Sen. Mark Kelly, a veteran and one of the six who made the video, saying that Hegseth’s targeting of Kelly had “trampled on Senator Kelly’s First Amendment freedoms.”

Why would Pirro and Hegseth subject themselves to such total humiliation and stark legal rebuke? Don’t they realize that a neutral observer would consider them historically bad at their jobs? Their audience of one, though, is not a neutral observer. The November video that those six Democrats released incensed Donald Trump, who posted on social media at the time that it was “SEDITIOUS BEHAVIOR AT THE HIGHEST LEVEL” and “punishable by DEATH!” There seems to be an understanding among Trump’s political appointees now that not doing the illegal action—refusing an illegal order, as one might put it—isn’t an option. Instead, it’s better to humor him by pursuing it and letting some element of the legal system—a judge, a grand jury—do the dirty work of keeping the rule of law at least somewhat intact. And while it’s nice when the legal system does its job, the Surge still believes that the best course of action is for government officials not to violate the constitutional rights of Trump’s enemies in the first place.

We must still allow ourselves to be shocked from time to time, and Attorney General Pam Bondi’s performance before the House Judiciary Committee on Wednesday ably did the job. She shouted and yelled and acted as if she were the one who was being shouted and yelled at, responded to various questions from Democratic members with unrelated oppo her staff had googled about them, suggested that members needed to apologize to Trump for having impeached him, and otherwise made a fool of herself. After Rep. Jerry Nadler asked how many Epstein co-conspirators she had indicted, she went on a rant about how great the stock market is doing under Trump. She called the Democratic ranking member of the committee, Rep. Jamie Raskin, a “washed-up loser lawyer!” (Raskin, in a fortunate bit of scheduling, was able to discuss his day with Bondi later that evening at a live taping of Slate’s Political Gabfest.)

Is there one person to whom this deeply embarrassing performance would have appealed? Someone who thinks talking about stock-market gains under Trump in response to unrelated questions is a winning strategy, who believes that those asking difficult questions suffer from “Trump derangement syndrome,” who thinks lawmakers should apologize to Donald Trump for having investigated and impeached him? Exactly. This was the most degrading congressional performance for the audience of one in recent memory. “AG Pam Bondi, under intense fire from the Trump Deranged Radical Left Lunatics, was fantastic at yesterday’s Hearing,” Trump posted Thursday. Bondi had been successful in saving her job, at great expense to her personal and our national dignity, for another few days.

Speaker Mike Johnson, at the White House’s request, tried to pass a rule this week preventing Democrats from forcing votes to repeal Trump’s tariffs. Republicans had been successful in passing such rules last year, and the vote this week was to extend the blockade through the summer. This time, however, it didn’t work: The rule vote failed, 217–214, as three Republicans joined all Democrats in voting against it. It’s now open season on Trump’s tariffs, as House Democrats will repeatedly force their GOP counterparts to choose between a president who expects loyalty and bad policy (and politics). Within a day of the failed rule vote, the House voted to nix Trump’s Canada tariffs.

Like clockwork, Trump issued a threat, warning that “any Republican, in the House or the Senate, that votes against TARIFFS will seriously suffer the consequences come Election time, and that includes Primaries!” But what does this pocket of members voting against tariffs care? Nebraska GOP Rep. Don Bacon, a regularly targeted swing-district member, is retiring this cycle. He voted against the rule, then left the premises so leaders couldn’t twist his arm. So, too, did California Rep. Kevin Kiley, who’s been redistricted off the planet in the Redistricting Wars (that Trump started). The last GOP member to vote against the rule was Kentucky Rep. Thomas Massie, who’s solidly in Trump enemy territory at this point. The House GOP’s margin is tight enough that it takes only a couple of House members to upend Johnson’s, and the White House’s, plans. And the ranks of GOP defectors may swell once primary season is over too.

Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick and Jeffrey Epstein were next-door neighbors on Manhattan’s Upper East Side. According to Lutnick, though, they barely knew each other. In a story Lutnick told on a podcast last year, he and his wife went in Epstein’s house once in 2005, got a house tour, and “decided that I will never be in the room with that disgusting person ever again,” adding, “I was never in the room with him socially, for business or even philanthropy.” As the Epstein files revealed, though, that wasn’t true. Lutnick and his family visited Epstein on his island in 2012, and the two were in business and otherwise corresponding sporadically over the years; at least one email suggests they had scheduled drinks.

So does “lying about having not been to the Epstein island” constitute a firing from Trump’s Cabinet? Not as of yet. Trump likes having Good-Time Howie around, for one, and if he starts doling out consequences to people for their associations with Epstein, well, that would put Trump himself in quite a corner. That Lutnick’s future in the Cabinet has been a live question all week speaks mostly to the number of enemies he’s made in Congress and the administration for his sycophancy on behalf of Trump’s worst impulses.

Virginia state Democrats’ proposed mid-decade gerrymander of their state is an assault on the eyes. The new map—if it skirts legal challenges and is approved by voters in an April referendum—could net Democrats four new congressional seats this year, converting its current delegation, six Democrats and five Republicans, into a 10–1 split. It achieves this in part by divvying up the trove of Democratic votes in dense Northern Virginia suburbs across the state, with narrow arms slinking south and west to rural communities that have very little in common with Arlington or Fairfax County. It’s some filthy, filthy stuff that will make for incoherent districts and stifle Republican congressional representation in a merely lean-blue state.

All of which is to say: womp—and again, womp. The move was a political necessity for Democrats, and the great many Virginia-based Republican operatives and pundits grousing about it should blame their president. Trump made a conscious move to kick off the mid-decade redistricting fight by urging Texas, Ohio, Missouri, Indiana, North Carolina, Florida, and anywhere else where Republicans could squeeze out a seat or five to redraw their maps. Retaliation happens. The Surge is all for a federal remedy, or a network of interstate compacts, to address this absurd trend of hyper-gerrymandering everywhere, but until then: no crying. As Virginia state Sen. Pro Tempore Louise Lucas, a fascinating 82-year-old edgelord who pushed for the new maps, replied to a griping Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, “You all started it and we fucking finished it.” (Although, honestly, the Supreme Court may be the ones who fucking finish it, sooner or later.)

On Monday, Trump posted that he would block the opening of a new U.S.–Canada bridge between Detroit and Windsor “until the United States is fully compensated for everything we have given them.” All right. He’s still mad at Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney for cutting a trade deal with China and for generally—here we go, we’re going to deploy this stupid word and see what happens—mogging him at Davos. So he won’t let Canada open a bridge that would ease congestion at a major international commercial crossing, which speaks to Carney’s general point about how the United States has become too irrational an actor to lead the global order.

But there’s more! Matthew Moroun, the billionaire owner of an existing, rival bridge—the Ambassador Bridge—has for years fought against the creation of the new bridge. And as the New York Times reported, Moroun met with the one and only Howard Lutnick on Monday, hours before Trump’s post, after which Lutnick spoke to Trump by phone. Trump’s post came after that telephone conversation. And with that, another episode’s worth of major investigation that would’ve done meaningful damage to any previous administration is added to the mountainous pile.

One of the most coveted congressional seats in the country is up for grabs now that longtime Rep. Jerry Nadler is retiring. New York’s 12th Congressional District covers the heart of Manhattan, and there’s an unsurprisingly long list of candidates. There’s Micah Lasher, a New York state Assembly member and former aide to Gov. Kathy Hochul, former Mayor Michael Bloomberg, and Nadler, who has endorsed him. There’s Alex Bores, another Assembly member who’s being targeted by corporate A.I. money after supporting an A.I. safety bill. There is George Conway, the conservative lawyer turned anti-Trumper and #Resistance celebrity. And many more.

And then there is Jack Schlossberg, JFK’s 33-year-old grandkid who didn’t do much of anything until he started posting weird stuff online a few years ago and briefly pretended to work as a reporter in 2024, deciding he’d like a congressional seat. It wasn’t taken all that seriously. And then, this week, he earned the endorsement of none other than former Speaker Nancy Pelosi, in what the Times described as “the most high-profile endorsement so far, of any candidate.” In a statement, Pelosi said, “This moment calls for leaders who understand the stakes and how to deliver for the people they serve.” And that’s … Jack Schlossberg, is it? Huh. The Kennedy mystique is strong in this one.

The machinery to enable Stephen Miller’s darkest deportation dreams is both tangible and legal. In this week’s show, Dahlia Lithwick explores the statutory and regulatory foundations of the Trump administration’s expanding network of detention camps, plus the historical background of the vast warehouse system they are using to imprison tens of thousands of migrants. First, she speaks with Linus Chan, who represents Minnesotans detained by ICE, he teaches law at the University of Minnesota School of Law. Chan describes how the most basic right of habeas corpus has been whittled away by the courts to a filament when it comes to immigration law, allowing the federal government to weaponize brutal detention against ordinary Americans.

Next, Dahlia is in conversation with Andrea Pitzer, about her chilling and urgent new piece, Building the camps: The warehouseification of detention and initial thoughts on stopping it. It is essential reading (and listening!) in light of the billion dollar detention camp system being built in warehouses near you in cities around the nation.

If you want to check if your town is on the list, Andrea recommends checking out Project Salt Box.

            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2026/02/16/former_windows_manager_explains_the/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">A former Windows boss has explained why the taskbar in Windows 11 is the way it is and how he &quot;fought hard&quot; to stop Microsoft from removing customization options present in Windows 10.

There are reports Microsoft is working on bringing back this functionality, though the Windows maker has not issued an official confirmation. However, Mikhail Parakhin, former CVP of Technology at Microsoft, explained the thinking behind the original decision to lock the taskbar in place.

Widgets were at least partially to blame.

&quot;The vision,&quot; Parakhin writes on X (formerly Twitter), &quot;was to create symmetric panes: you have notification/system controls/etc. pane on the right, Weather/Widgets/News pane on the left. That pushed start menu into the center position.

&quot;If you have taskbar vertically, it starts conflicting with the panes...&quot;

The taskbar in Windows 11 is located at the bottom of the screen. It cannot be moved or resized. It has also long been a bone of contention among many users of the operating system, who remember the days when the strip could be relocated. Parakhin writes, &quot;Windows had it since 95, that&#39;s how I use it my whole life.&quot;

It is possible to align the content of the taskbar to the left and also have it automatically disappear in Windows 11. However, moving the bar itself to the top, left, or right sides of the desktop is not supported.

Parakhin famously made that &quot;make Start menu great again&quot; post at the beginning of 2024, although the current state of the enlarged user interface component is unlikely what users had in mind. Microsoft also relentlessly pushed advertising into Windows during Parakhin&#39;s tenure as CEO of Advertising and Web Services from 2022 to 2024.

So there you have it. Microsoft decided to sacrifice Windows 10-levels of taskbar customization to, at least in part, inflict Widgets on users of its flagship operating system. For many, this will confirm that Microsoft spent the last few years stepping back from one of the original tenets of Windows – customization.

Even Copilot, whom many might say adds functionality that users haven&#39;t asked for, is critical of the direction of travel. When we gave it the prompt &quot;Should the taskbar of Windows be moveable?&quot; it came up with this response: &quot;A core principle of Windows has always been flexibility. Locking the taskbar to the bottom feels like a step backward in user control.&quot; ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Although we&#39;re in mid-February, the Linux Mint project just published its January 2026 blog. This could be seen as one sign of the pressure on the creator of this very successful distro: although the post talks about forthcoming improved input localization support and user management, it also discusses the pressures of the project&#39;s semi-annual release schedule.

The Mint project&#39;s latest post thanks a record-breaking 1,000 + donors, and talks about future plans – which may include a slower release schedule.

We covered the release of Linux Mint 22.3 in mid-January, and apparently it&#39;s been a hit. The Linux Mint project received an impressive 1,393 donations last month, totalling $47,312 (£34,713) – a new record, and aside from the controversial Distrowatch rankings, it is another decent measure of the distro&#39;s deserved popularity. The blog post also mentions new features that the development team are working on. These show the breadth of problems that a widely used distro faces.

The team is working on further improving Cinnamon&#39;s input method support, such as automatically switching keyboard layout when choosing a particular input method – Clement Lefebvre, founder, project leader and main developer of Linux Mint, gives the example of automatically switching to a Japanese layout when the user chooses mozc. Another cross-desktop issue is managing user accounts, and so the team is adding this feature to the new Mint System Administration tool that appeared in the latest version.

Work on official Wayland support in Cinnamon continues, and one issue the Mint team is taking on is screensaver support. Currently Cinnamon&#39;s screensavers only work if you&#39;re using X11. Quite simply, Wayland has no provision for screensavers. This is by design, and the creator of XScreensaver, the inimitable Jamie Zawinski, has discussed the problems with some feeling:

Wayland does not support screen savers: it does not have any provision that allows screen savers to even exist in any meaningful way. If you value screen savers, that&#39;s kind of a problem.

Why doesn&#39;t it? Well, I suppose the designers of Wayland have no joy in their cold, black hearts simply do not value screen savers.

It&#39;s worth a read – JWZ always is – and the struck-out text especially speaks to us. Notably, he discusses some of the issues with trying to add support for screensavers to a Wayland compositor.

With all these efforts going on – some of them substantial undertakings – it&#39;s no wonder that the developers are feeling the strain. The final section of the blog is titled Longer Development Cycle and talks about the pressure of Mint&#39;s semi-annual point releases, ending:

With a release every six months plus LMDE, we spend more time testing, fixing, and releasing than developing.

We&#39;re thinking about changing that and adopting a longer development cycle. As it happens, our next release will be based on a new LTS and we just ran out of codenames.

This wouldn&#39;t be the first time the Mint project has changed its release cycle. Linux Mint 1.0 &quot;Ada&quot; was based on Kubuntu 6.06, Canonical&#39;s first ever LTS release of Ubuntu. From then until Mint 16, which The Register reviewed in December 2013, Mint tracked all Ubuntu releases, including the interim ones. Since Mint 17 the following year, it switched to only offering versions based on Ubuntu LTS releases – but each major version is followed by point releases, which follow after the upstream point releases of Ubuntu LTS – and all of these receive long-term support, as does Ubuntu itself. It&#39;s a lot of maintenance work.

The Reg FOSS desk has looked at each release since Linux Mint 21 entered beta, and we have noticed that only the flavor with Mint&#39;s in-house Cinnamon desktop gets a new version of the desktop with each point release. In contrast, the Xfce and MATE editions stay with the version of the desktop that they shipped with, which they inherit from the corresponding Ubuntu LTS.

As the Mint developers look for ways to reduce the effort they spend on testing and release, perhaps they might consider reducing the number of the non-flagship editions. If only the Cinnamon edition gets new desktops, then perhaps the others could be dropped to more minor releases – even if this means altering the numbering scheme.

Or, alternatively, maybe it&#39;s time to prune the number of different editions. Back in 2018, Linux Mint 19 dropped the KDE desktop, dropping the number of desktops from four to three. Maybe it&#39;s time to do that again. We are loath to suggest it, because we&#39;re very fond of Xfce around the Irish Sea wing of Vulture Towers, but the field of Ubuntu flavours with Xfce is already served exceptionally well.

Obviously, there is the official Xubuntu. It offers a minimal install option with no Snap packages installed, for those averse to Canonical&#39;s cross-distro packaging format. There&#39;s also Linux Lite, which has neither Snap nor Flatpak; we looked at version 7.6 in September 2025, but at the end of last month, Linux Lite 7.8 came out. There&#39;s also Asmi Linux 24.04 which lets the user choose which packaging formats to support.

Another Ubuntu- and Xfce-based alternative distro is on its way out. The other beginner-friendly Ubuntu-based distro to come out of Dublin, Zorin OS, is sunsetting Zorin OS Lite, its Xfce-based variant. One of the reasons is that the full-fat GNOME-based edition runs well – even on low-end computers – now. That applies equally to Linux Mint – and while MATE isn&#39;t quite as light as Xfce, it does run perfectly well on computers lacking full hardware 3D acceleration.

In an ideal world, we&#39;d like to see these separate projects cooperate and maybe share some of the maintenance burden – a distro that combined Mint Xfce with Zorin OS Lite&#39;s themes and Linux Lite&#39;s handy accessory tools could be a very tempting offering – but that seems unlikely to happen. ®

            <h2>Keir Starmer declares 'months' timeline for social media age clampdown in UK</h2>
            <p><strong>The Register | 2026-02-16</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2026/02/16/starmer_social_media/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">UK prime minister Keir Starmer has set a &quot;months&quot; timeline for the long-brewing plan for a social media age limit, signaling the government is ready to pick a fight with Big Tech if that&#39;s what it takes.

In a Substack post, Starmer said ministers want powers to set a minimum age for social media far more quickly than it took to grind the Online Safety Act through Parliament, arguing the move is needed to prevent children from being exposed to harmful content and addictive platform design.

The post lands alongside a broader package of measures the government says will be fleshed out through a consultation starting in March as ministers look to expand and tweak the existing online safety framework.

Starmer leaned heavily on the idea that social platforms are distorting children&#39;s development, warning: &quot;Young people&#39;s sense of self depends on this algorithm.&quot;

His post singles out so-called engagement features, such as infinite scroll and auto-play, as examples of functionality that could face restrictions if officials deem them detrimental to children&#39;s well-being, indicating a willingness to push beyond content moderation into the mechanics of how platforms capture attention.

&quot;We will bring new powers that will give us the ability to crack down on the addictive elements of social media, stop the auto-play, the never-ending scrolling, that keeps are [sic] children hooked on their screens for hours, and stop kids getting around age limits,&quot; Starmer wrote.

The UK wouldn&#39;t be alone in targeting infinite feeds. EU regulators are already probing TikTok over whether its limitless scrolling and recommendation algorithms pose systemic risks under the Digital Services Act, a case that could force design changes and set a precedent for others to follow.

Another eyebrow-raising idea is limiting children&#39;s ability to use VPNs to dodge safeguards, a nod to the cat-and-mouse game regulators face whenever age checks or feature restrictions are introduced, but exactly how that would work in practice is anyone&#39;s guess.

The government is also proposing measures that will require tech companies to preserve data on a child&#39;s device if they die – a change championed by campaigners behind so-called Jools&#39; Law – and to bring AI chatbots more explicitly into scope of the online safety regime, reflecting growing concern about how younger users interact with generative tools and the &quot;vile illegal content&quot; created by AI.

This move follows recent scrutiny of Elon Musk&#39;s Grok chatbot after the UK&#39;s privacy watchdog opened a formal investigation into xAI over the bot generating sexual images of real people without consent – a scandal that has intensified calls to tighten rules around AI tools.

Technology secretary Liz Kendall said: &quot;I know that parents across the country want us to act urgently to keep their children safe online. That&#39;s why I stood up to Grok and Elon Musk when they flouted British laws and British values.&quot;

&quot;We will not wait to take the action families need, so we will tighten the rules on AI chatbots and we are laying the ground so we can act at pace on the results of the consultation on young people and social media,&quot; Kendall added. &quot;We are determined to give children the childhood they deserve and to prepare them for the future at time of rapid technological change.&quot;

The tone throughout Starmer&#39;s post is combative, with the PM framing the effort as a willingness to take on Silicon Valley if necessary. &quot;And if that means a fight with the big social media companies, then bring it on,&quot; he said.

However, it&#39;s not just social media platforms that are unlikely to welcome Starmer&#39;s fast-track plans. Digital rights groups have warned that any meaningful under-16 ban quickly runs into the reality of age-gating at scale, which they claim would mean mass age checks across large swathes of the internet.

For now, nothing changes overnight, but by setting a &quot;months&quot; timeline for age limits, floating curbs on addictive features, and widening the rules to cover AI tools, platforms have been put firmly on notice. ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The UK&#39;s Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency (DVSA) is recruiting a chief digital and information officer, partly to help sort out its bot-ridden practical driving test booking system.

&quot;You will lead a critical portfolio that supports DVSA&#39;s plan (launched in December 2024) to reduce driving test waiting times, protect learner drivers from exploitation, and improve the customer booking system,&quot; stated chief executive Beverley Warmington, who joined the agency at the end of last year.

Warmington said the agency plans to double the size of its digital, data, and technology directorate, and bring more services in-house. Applications for the job, which has a salary of £95,000, close on February 22.

In December, the National Audit Office (NAO) criticized the DVSA over long waits for its practical driving tests. The NAO said these were primarily down to a lack of examiners but the situation was worsened by the agency&#39;s 18-year-old booking system being vulnerable to targeting by third-party cancellation checkers and slot resellers. It found some candidates paid up to £500 to secure a test that costs £62 on weekdays.

The government is changing the rules this spring so that tests can only be booked by candidates themselves, cutting out instructors and businesses, as well as limiting changes to a booking.

The new chief digital and information officer will take over from Becky Thomas, who is retiring. &quot;I&#39;m incredibly proud of what we&#39;ve achieved together as an agency,&quot; she wrote in a recent GOV.UK blog post.

Of the booking problems, she said: &quot;Our teams are working at pace to design, build, and deliver improvements to the current system following extensive consultation with our customers and the driver training industry.&quot;

Thomas highlighted other successes, including DVSA&#39;s introduction of British sign language bookings for driving theory tests and allowing payments with Apple Pay and Google Pay. She added that more than six million people have signed up for free text or email alerts to remind them about their MOT, the legally required annual roadworthiness check named after the former Ministry of Transport. DVSA introduced the reminders in 2017. ®

            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2026/02/16/anthropic_claude_ai_edits/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Anthropic has updated Claude Code, its AI coding tool, changing the progress output to hide the names of files the tool was reading, writing, or editing. However, developers have pushed back, stating that they need to see which files are accessed.

Version 2.1.20 collapsed the output so that instead of showing, for example, the file names and how many lines were read, it would just print &quot;Read 3 files (ctrl+o to expand),&quot; according to a post complaining that &quot;Claude Code is being dumbed down.&quot; The full details can still be accessed with the keyboard shortcut, but constantly invoking this is annoying and impractical.

Developers have many reasons for wanting to see the file names, such as for security, for knowing immediately if Claude is pulling context from the wrong files, and for easy audit of past activity by scrolling through conversation. &quot;When I&#39;m working on a complex codebase, knowing what context Claude is pulling helps me catch mistakes early and steer the conversation,&quot; one person wrote.

There&#39;s also a financial impact. If developers spot that Claude is going down a wrong track, they can interrupt and avoid wasting tokens.

A GitHub issue on the subject drew a response from Boris Cherny, creator and head of Claude Code at Anthropic, that &quot;this isn&#39;t a vibe coding feature, it&#39;s a way to simplify the UI so you can focus on what matters, diffs and bash/mcp outputs.&quot; He suggested that developers &quot;try it out for a few days&quot; and said that Anthropic&#39;s own developers &quot;appreciated the reduced noise.&quot;

Cherny said that developers who wanted more detail could enable verbose mode. Responses were lackluster, with one person writing: &quot;Verbose mode is not a viable alternative, there&#39;s way too much noise.&quot;

Another observation was that the new default output, such as &quot;searched for 2 patterns, read 3 files,&quot; conveys no useful information. &quot;It&#39;s not a nice simplification, it&#39;s an idiotic removal of valuable information,&quot; said a user.

Cherny responded to the feedback by making changes. &quot;We have repurposed the existing verbose mode setting for this,&quot; he said, so that it &quot;shows file paths for read/searches. Does not show full thinking, hook output, or subagent output (coming in tomorrow&#39;s release).&quot;

The problem with this is that making verbose mode less verbose is a bad change for those who wanted the full details.

Cherny also participated in a lengthy discussion on Hacker News. &quot;Claude has gotten more intelligent, it runs for longer periods of time, and it is able to more agentically use more tools... The amount of output this generates can quickly become overwhelming in a terminal, and is something we hear often from users,&quot; he said.

Those users who want the collapsed output seem to be mostly absent from the discussion. &quot;I can&#39;t tell you how many times I benefited from seeing the files Claude was reading, to understand how I could interrupt and give it a little more context... saving thousands of tokens,&quot; said one response.

Cherny said that the repurposed verbose mode was the solution, and that Claude Code will still default to the condensed view.

The debate is important because if AI tools like Claude Code hide what they are doing from developers (or other users), mistakes are more likely to slip through. &quot;I&#39;m a Claude user who has been burned lately by how opaque the system has become,&quot; said another developer. &quot;Right now Claude cannot be trusted to get things right without constant oversight and frequent correction, often for just a single step. For people like me, this is make or break. If I cannot follow the reasoning, read the intent, or catch logic disconnects early, the session just burns through my token quota.&quot;

Claude Code changes frequently, so it is likely that this aspect will be further tweaked, but there is not yet any indication that it will revert to the old behavior. ®

            <div id="article-text">Opinion If you&#39;ve ever flipped over a power brick, you&#39;ll be familiar with the hieroglyphics of type approval. It&#39;s become less crazy over the years as things have got smaller and signage requirements softened, but at its peak tens of logos and acronyms of testing labs and national approvals covered the backside of PSUs in surrealist graffiti.

There was and is method to it. Type approval means that the device won&#39;t kill you, won&#39;t jam your airwaves, won&#39;t burst into flames, and other desirable negatives. If a business buys approved equipment, it won&#39;t invalidate its insurance, and many other legal protections and permissions flow. When the system stops working, which it does when individual consumers can buy cheap stuff directly from overseas, fiery death can follow.

There hasn&#39;t been an equivalent concept in software, at least not in general. Life-critical systems with software in, yes, and lots of industry codes and compliance incantations, but never national guarantees of software or service behavior. Now there are good and growing needs for this to change. There are dangerous aspects of design and implementation common to many different classes of product, invisible to users, and no way of knowing what is safe.

Fortunately, organizations, nation-states, and entire blocs can and do recognize what&#39;s happening, and are beginning to react. If you use a service or software that stores your data or identity in a place or with people with no legal protection against state interference, you have no privacy or protection from being locked out.

Which is why, of course, digital sovereignty is so desirable. The bigger you are, the more practicable it is to realize, although it is very far from easy. Technologies, standards, procurement policies, implementations, user bases, support hierarchies – all manner of things have to be moved and coordinated. The whole thing must make practical, economic, and sustainable sense. We&#39;re seeing this happen, especially in Europe.

Matrix is a good example. A longstanding open messaging protocol with a coherent and sensibly stratified FOSS/commercial client roadmap, it is becoming the underpinning of choice for the digisov desirous, from the EU down. It&#39;s no guarantee of goodness, but if you want to go that way, it&#39;s a great component.

Or look at the European Payment Initiative (EPI). This isn&#39;t an EU initiative, but a project of European payment service providers (PSPs). The clue&#39;s in the name: PSPs are the entities that handle electronic transactions between customers and suppliers. Visa and Mastercard manage around two-thirds of all EU-based transactions and neither is European. There is no one European PSP, no one name to go to.

Last week, PSPs from Norway, Spain, Portugal, and Italy signed up to the EPI, sharing a common Europe-based transactional hub and letting customers in 17 countries use their existing payment providers interoperably. This isn&#39;t about open source. It isn&#39;t about EU-level political decisions. It creates a sovereign digital service just the same. It also demonstrates that digisov does not need to map onto political boundaries. Norway isn&#39;t in the EU, and other non-EU and non-Eurozone countries can join. They just need to have compatible regulatory and legal regimes.

It is thus entirely possible to see an EU definition of alignment that would grant membership of the European digital sovereign entity. Don&#39;t let the users get burned, then you get to use the regulatory mark. You get access to sectors and markets where alignment is either mandatory or very highly desirable.

Such services and products could be bundled into platforms, markets, and product categories. If it&#39;s possible, barely, for a savvy, motivated, focused organization to build its IT with some degree of digisov, think how far away the concept of a European consumer alternative in packaged services and products is to Apple, Google, or Microsoft. How would anyone begin to find AWS or Azure-free services online? Add a compliance mark, and the impossible becomes possible. No changes in law, no international treaties, just a single recognizable symbol that says that this will not catch fire and burn you.

Armed with that, anyone can join forces. You could build a Linux distro. You could align your existing Swiss-based secure email service, or your German datacenter company, or anything that&#39;s useful and follows the rules.

All it needs, at heart, is a definition of what qualifies a service, product, component, or entity as aligned. In other words, what the concept means in practice. What rights are guaranteed to users, their identity, and their data, not just in terms of what the organization promises but that the promises can be kept no matter what. That means operating in regimes without overweening laws or exemptions to individual rights. One could even call such a definition a constitution.

There&#39;s no need for anyone so minded to wait for permission to start this process. Find fellow travelers and talk to them. A rough consensus will do for starters, alongside honesty, and fearsome commitment. If the concept&#39;s good and the timing is right, it will catch fire – in the right way. You can&#39;t rally to the flag if there is no flag. If there is, nobody can stop you. ®

﻿Leaker Ice Universe has shared a video of the tech in action.

Samsung has released a new advertisement for its upcoming Galaxy S26 launch that all-but confirms rumors of a new display with a built-in privacy mode. Leaked videos show that the feature could be capable of entirely blacking out content from specific apps or parts of the display when viewed at an angle.

The new advert shows a woman reading a racy romance novel on a subway, while curious passengers look over her shoulder. An overlay shows a quick flick of a “Zero-peeking privacy” toggle, which blacks out the titillating content for the nosy onlookers.

That might sound similar to existing privacy filters, which have been available as after-market screen protectors for years, or found built into products including certain HP laptops. But leaks say what Samsung has in store for the S26 range is different.

It will reportedly use a new type of OLED panel that Samsung Display first debuted two years ago at MWC 2024 called Flex Magic Pixel. It allows viewing angles to be adjusted on a pixel-by-pixel basis, so the privacy effect is only applied to certain parts of the screen at a time. Combined with some AI, that means it could automatically protect sensitive information in a banking app, or be used to hide notifications in a messaging app, as shown in this short video clip shared by the reliable leaker Ice Universe.

We’ll find out more soon enough — Samsung has confirmed that its Unpacked launch event will take place later this month, on February 25th.

TikTok creator ByteDance says that it is working to improve safeguards on its new AI video generator after Disney, Paramount, and Hollywood trade groups accused the tool of violating copyright protections. Concerns were raised after hyperrealistic videos generated by the Seedance 2.0 model went viral last week, with the likeness of actors, such as Tom Cruise and Brad Pitt, and characters from Dragon Ball Z, Family Guy, and Pokémon.

“ByteDance respects intellectual property rights and we have heard the concerns regarding Seedance 2.0,” a ByteDance spokesperson said in a statement shared by CNBC. “We are taking steps to strengthen current safeguards as we work to prevent the unauthorized use of intellectual property and likeness by users.”

ByteDance’s response comes after receiving complaints from major studios. In a cease and desist letter sent on Friday, Disney accused ByteDance of “hijacking” its protected characters by “reproducing, distributing, and creating derivative works” that feature them. Deadline reports that Paramount Skydance followed with its own cease and desist letter, demanding that ByteDance remove all infringing instances of Paramount content and prevent it from being generated in the future.

Hollywood trade groups have also weighed in, including the Motion Picture Association (MPA) and SAG-AFTRA talent union. MPA CEO Charles Rivkin issued a statement accusing ByteDance of engaging in copyright infringement at a “massive scale,” and disregarding well-established laws that underpin “millions of American jobs.” SAG-AFTRA said that its members’ voices and likenesses have been used by Seedance 2.0 without authorization.

“This is unacceptable and undercuts the ability of human talent to earn a livelihood,” SAG-AFTRA said in a statement to AP News. “Seedance 2.0 disregards law, ethics, industry standards and basic principles of consent. Responsible AI development demands responsibility, and that is nonexistent here.”

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">One night in the audience of Netflix’s most ambitious live show yet.

Two hours before one of the most important live events in Netflix’s history, LA’s sprawling CBS Radford Studio Center is abuzz with the strangest combination of things. As I walk through one cavernous soundstage on a Tuesday afternoon, I hear multiple people warming up their voices to sing. I pass a man carefully waving a hair dryer in front of a piano. Outside, a man and a woman, both in scant black leather, walk past with a wave. I’m told they’re aerialists. Somewhere in this enormous rehearsal space, there’s also a 74-year-old budding standup comedian, an 11-year-old gospel singer, and a dancing border collie.

Such is the wondrous, bizarre versatility of Star Search, which on this January evening will start a five-week run of live shows streamed to Netflix’s 300 million-plus subscribers. It’s a reboot of one of TV’s most successful talent shows, though your average Stranger Things fan has likely never heard of it. It also represents one of Netflix’s biggest programming bets ever. The company has spent years building the technical infrastructure to stream all over the world, while also quietly testing show formats and interactive features to see how it might tweak a competition show to make sense in a world overrun by social media.

The company has done huge one-off events, like a boxing match between Jake Paul and Mike Tyson; it has done live shows, like Everybody’s Live with John Mulaney. It has hit shows and blockbuster movies, and the ability to turn a decade-old show nobody’s ever heard of into a No. 1 hit. It has wrestling and even some of the NFL. But Netflix has never really tried to do the hardest thing in TV: get its audience to show up, night after night and week after week, to build a simple talent show into an undeniable star-making machine.

When shows like this work, they become cultural events in their own right. Think of American Idol, The Voice, whatever Got Talent you like — all are among the most popular and long-lasting franchises you’ll find anywhere. “There are those formats that are undeniable,” Brandon Riegg, Netflix’s head of unscripted programming, tells me. He sees American Idol as the genre’s true gold standard. “We’ll never see another Idol, in terms of the gap between Idol and the second-place show,” he says, “but we can certainly try to say, ‘What’s the next iteration?’”

The next iteration is about to take place in the next soundstage I enter, which I do cautiously, so as not to run into the enormous pallet filled with every imaginable size and shape of cactus. The Star Search studio is enormous, with bright screens along one wall and a lit-up star at least twice my height casting a golden glow around the room. There are three stages in the room, plus an elevated platform in the center from which the show’s celebrity judges will watch the night’s proceedings. The only hints as to what’s coming tonight: a single chair on one stage, and a tall platform on another that is perfectly suited for falling off to your death in front of millions of people.

With about 90 minutes to air, 450 select audience members are finally allowed to leave the parking garage they’ve been waiting in, and begin to file into the studio. Most don’t know quite what to expect, other than some good celebrity sightings and maybe a chance to be on Netflix themselves. Meanwhile, the team at Netflix is about to find out whether their platform can mint a superstar.

A few minutes after the evening’s audience takes their seats, the event’s emcee, Chuck Dukas, explains how the show works. Most of the audience seems as confused as I am by his explanation, so allow me to try my own: Star Search is America’s Got Talent in content and Jeopardy! in structure. The show features eight categories, from dance to stand-up to music to magic, four of which are shown in a given episode. Each category has a champion, crowned the best of the previous episode, and a challenger, there to knock the champion off the throne. Both contestants do their thing, the judges each give them a score between one and four, and whoever receives the highest average score advances to the next episode to take on a new challenger. Win enough times, and you’re guaranteed a spot in the season finale, where a single grand champion will win $500,000.

Most of the format is borrowed from the original Star Search, which first aired in 1983. It was originally created by Al Masini, a legendary producer who also had a hand in shows from Entertainment Tonight to Baywatch. Masini’s idea was to do an amateur talent show, with carefully chosen acts, presented as glitzily as possible. “We gave them the best lighting available, we gave them the best audio… we put them in a Tiffany setting,” producer Bob Banner said in an interview with the Television Academy years later. “If they didn’t perform well, there’s nothing we could do about it, but we gave them every advantage.”

The show ran until 1995 (not including a reboot nobody really remembers), with Ed McMahon as genial host, and featured an astonishing number of now-household names. Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera, Justin Timberlake, Usher, and Beyoncé all sang on the show as young kids; Adam Sandler, Dave Chappelle, and Rosie O’Donnell all competed as comedians; Sharon Stone competed as a “spokesmodel,” a category that mercifully no longer exists, in the show’s very first episode.

There is something about the Star Search structure that feels distinctly modern, even four decades after its debut. You can watch a lot of old episodes and clips on YouTube, and it is remarkable just how fast the show moved in those early days. There’s no long windup to each contestant, no heartstring-pulling backstory documentary; there is just a singer and then another singer. An actor and another actor. McMahon slings his arm around the contestant, they get a score, and we’re off to the next one.

Ultimately, that format meant that Star Search had nothing else to offer you but performances. Nearly everyone I spoke to said that casting Star Search was the hardest and most important part of the development process, and that while a show like The Voice or American Idol can survive on the strength of its format and cast alone, Star Search lives and dies a performance at a time. “We’re not booking bad acts to get jokes out of it, you know?” says David Friedman, the show’s co-showrunner. “We’re saying, basically, ‘Look, there’s two acts here, we’re looking for a star. Is there one out here that’s a star?’”

This turns out to have two distinct advantages for Netflix. The first is a more universal appeal: While senses of humor and cultural references may differ across age groups, borders, and demographics, good singing is good singing to pretty much everyone. “And if you don’t like singing,” Friedman says, “wait five minutes. We’ll have a magician for you.”

The second, and maybe more important, is that Star Search functions eerily like a TikTok feed. Look, a dancer! Ooh, magic! Here’s three minutes of stand-up! Time for a cover of your favorite *NSYNC song! Jesse Collins, one of the show’s executive producers, embraces the comparison. “In a way, social media has prepared the world for this,” he says. “You’ll go on TikTok and you’ll fall in love with somebody that does tricks or is a comedian or is a singer or like someone like an IShowSpeed.”

The opportunity for Netflix, Collins says, is to do it bigger and better. To take people out of their parking garages, bedrooms, and passenger seats, and put them back in the “Tiffany setting.” Many of the acts on the show’s first season already have large social followings, some in the millions, which seems to stretch the definition of an amateur talent show. But there may be something still uniquely star-making about Netflix.

Jeff Gaspin, Netflix’s vice president of unscripted series, says he was convinced of all this as soon as he saw the pitch for the show. A group led by the actress Taraji P. Henson had been developing a reboot for a while, and Gaspin immediately thought it might work for Netflix. But he offered a wrinkle: What if the audience could vote? In the original show, the in-studio audience was occasionally called upon to break the judges’ tie scores, but Gaspin thought maybe the audience should operate as effectively a fourth judge, voting in real time from their couches. And he wanted them to be able to vote with their remotes, right on screen, during the broadcast.

Netflix’s product team spent months building a voting system into its apps for mobile devices (where you can vote if you want to), and onto every TV platform and streaming box you can think of. They ran tests with audiences and tested voting in somewhat innocuous places, like a live cooking show hosted by celebrity chef Dave Chang, in which the audience got to rate sandwiches. It all worked, and early testers used it and loved it. So on Star Search, viewers get a pop-up at the end of every performance asking them to rate it from one to five stars, and the average score makes up a quarter of the contestant’s overall rating. Ironically, the only people who don’t get to vote are those of us in the studio audience. We’re under very strict instructions not to use our phones.

Going into the evening, I expected the live voting tools to be on everyone’s minds. If not that, then certainly the uniquely global audience potentially tuning in. But the cast and crew actually seemed more worried about another very Netflix-y thing: This edition of Star Search has no commercial breaks. Commercials, see, are a godsend to the cast and crew. “That’s the time you spend two and a half minutes going, Okay, where are we going next?” Friedman says. “And saying, Oh, the tape’s not ready? Here’s what we’re going to do.” Breaks also give a show its shape, and without them, “there’s no natural ebb and flow anymore,” he says. “It’s just going to have to go.”

Ahead of the first show, Friedman has been chatting with Anthony Anderson, the Black-ish star who is Star Search’s new host. “I’m in his ear, and I’m like, ‘Look, you’re on live TV with no commercials. If something is not working for you, own it,’” Friedman says. “We have passed the point in which you have to hide stuff — viewers like to be brought in on the ride.” Part of making live TV, multiple people told me, is being able to embrace the chaos.

On this Tuesday evening, at least, there is surprisingly little chaos. With about an hour to spare before the 6PM live start, emcee Chuck announces that we’re going to pretape the magic portion of the competition, for reasons no one ever explains. (This eventually causes some conspiracy theories, as viewers of the “live” show notice some clues that they’re seeing old footage.) Both competitors’ tricks go off without a hitch, everyone goes backstage, and Anderson comes back out to practice his intro to the show. Then he’s banished with three and a half minutes to air, and all that’s left to do is wait.

Precisely at the top of the hour, Netflix’s iconic “tudum” sound thunders through the room, Anderson walks out, and the live show commences. Anderson explains to the camera how the show works, has the audience vote on his suit to practice, and kicks off the proceedings. The rest of the show is a blur of singers (Friedman told me just ahead of air that two young kids would be going first, and that yes, he knows it’s kind of cheating to use adorable children to make people like your show), dancers, magicians, and musical groups.

There were, of course, plenty of things to work on. The three celebrity judges — Sarah Michelle Gellar, Jelly Roll, and Chrissy Teigen — were all far too nice to the contestants, even when they gave them bad scores. They also all talked way too much. The sound mixing, particularly on the groups, didn’t always actually mix. At one point, Anderson was visibly confused by the teleprompter, which was instructing him to look in three different places for three different scoring numbers. There were some solid performances, but no obvious stars, and a couple of genuine stinkers. Mostly, the whole thing took too long. This supposedly 60-minute show lasted 90. Still, the voting worked, the stream stayed live, and the whole room seemed to exhale as the confetti fell and the lights turned off.

This was just the first night. There were seven more to do in the next four weeks, plus a grand finale episode on February 17th. Judging from the early reactions, Star Search wasn’t quite a cultural phenomenon yet, but Friedman says he knows even Netflix can’t create a hit all at once. “We do this for five weeks and hopefully it builds, and hopefully the excitement builds, and we get to the end and there’ll be one champion — and hopefully you discover the next somebody.” Everybody studiously avoids jinxing the next season, because Netflix is famous for canceling and forgetting about projects it deems not to be working. But it’s clear the company hopes this was the first night of many in this studio.

Just as we’re all filing out, heading back into a mild LA evening, Dukas the emcee booms back out over the audience telling everyone to take their seats. “Okay!” he says. “We’re going to do the show again in Spanish, and then we’ll get you out of here.”

OpenClaw will live on as an open-source project.

Sam Altman announced on X that Peter Steinberger, the man behind the trendy AI agent OpenClaw, was joining OpenAI. He said that Steinberger has “a lot of amazing ideas” about getting AI agents to interact with each other, saying “the future is going to be extremely multi-agent.” He also said that this ability for agents to work together will “quickly become core to our product offerings.”

OpenClaw, previously known as Moltbot and Clawdbot, exploded on the scene earlier this year and became the darling of the tech world. Its rise was swift, but not without its bumps along the way. Earlier this month, researchers found over 400 malicious skills uploaded to ClawHub. It also launched MoltBook, a social network where AI agents went to complain about their humans, debate the provability of consciousness, and discuss the need for a private place to exchange ideas. And then it was immediately infiltrated by humans.

In a post on his personal site, Steinberger said that joining OpenAI would allow him to achieve his goal of bringing AI agents to the masses, without the headaches of running a company. He explained:

I could totally see how OpenClaw could become a huge company. And no, it’s not really exciting for me. I’m a builder at heart. I did the whole creating-a-company game already, poured 13 years of my life into it and learned a lot. What I want is to change the world, not build a large company and teaming up with OpenAI is the fastest way to bring this to everyone.

For OpenAI, this is a high-profile hire after several big names were poached by Meta or left to form a rival. It also had a public falling-out with Elon Musk. Details of the deal aren’t public. It’s not clear how much Steinberger is getting paid or what his title might be. But Altman said that OpenClaw will continue as an open-source project in a foundation supported by OpenAI.

Let me just say that I highly recommend you go into Possession blind. Don’t watch a trailer. Don’t even finish reading this. Go watch it now over on Shudder, Criterion, or Metrograph. It’s also available through Kanopy or Hoopla if your library provides access. Then come back so we can talk about it in the comments. Though this probably isn’t one for the squeamish.

Possession is the sort of film that, even if you’ve had the whole plot spoiled for you, can be difficult to follow. After watching it twice, listening to three different podcasts, and reading multiple articles about it, I’m still not 100 percent sure what happened at various points in the movie. I just know I loved it.

You’re dropped immediately into a story about a crumbling marriage set against the backdrop of the Berlin Wall. It’s a formidable metaphor for the division between the stars — a very young and disarmingly handsome Sam Neill (Mark), and Isabelle Adjani (Anna), who turns in one of the most singular and unnerving performances in the history of cinema. Watching Adjani on screen is exhausting — She ricochets between unsettling detachment and high-octane delirium with alarming ease and speed. It’s the sort of performance that, when you hear it basically gave Adjani PTSD, you’re not surprised.

The third standout performance comes from Heinz Bennent, who plays Heinrich, the man Mark believes Anna is leaving him for. He moves through every scene like a drunk ballet dancer, and there’s something almost Wiseau-ian about his delivery. (It certainly doesn’t help that he keeps repeating Mark’s name.) In a more grounded film, the way he careens through the frame would seem absurd. But in the abstract nightmare of Possession, Bennent fits perfectly, rolling around, alternately assaulting Mark and coming on to him.

Director Andrzej Żuławski not only coaxes gorgeously unhinged performances from his stars, he builds live-action paintings. Mark and Ana sit in a cafe at the corner of a bench facing away from each other as they discuss the terms of their separation. (Before Mark tears through the cafe, hurling chairs and tables in a freakout for the ages.) Sam Neill violently pitches a rocking chair back and forth as the focus expertly tracks him. The film is simply gorgeous.

What begins as a bad acid trip about a failing marriage turns into a nausea-inducing body horror in its back half. It’s revealed that Anna isn’t leaving Mark for Heinrich. In fact, Heinrich is just as desperate to get Anna back, to find her and make her his. Instead, she is shacked up with what Anna Bogutskaya (host of The Final Girls podcast and author of Feeding the Monster) calls a “Lovecraftian fuck monster.”

It’s a grotesquerie of tentacles, oozing orifices, and uncanny humanoid features, created by Carlo Rambaldi, who won Academy Awards for special effects on Alien and ET. It feeds on people. Their bodies, but also their souls. Anna seems to think it’s some sort of deity, something holy. She uses it to explore parts of herself she has repressed or lost in her relationship with Mark.

The other men in her life can’t satisfy her, so she creates an ideal lover. What starts as a slimy creature, not unlike the baby from Eraserhead, eventually becomes a doppleganger of Mark.

And then there’s the subway scene. If you’ve ever heard of Possession before, it’s probably because of this scene. Adjani hurls herself around a deserted tunnel, grunting, screaming, convulsing, before oozing blood and god knows all over the wet concrete floor. As a viewer, I feel drained after watching it. It’s three of the most intense minutes ever committed to celluloid, and even if the rest of the film was terrible, Possession would be worth watching just for this scene.

There are so many different readings of this film. I’m still not entirely sure what happens at the end. Did their son Bob drown himself? Is Mark’s doppleganger the antichrist? Is Helen also a doppleganger? (I think so.) What is the deal with Heinrich’s mother? Is Anna possessed? Or is the titular possession about the men in her life trying to exert ownership of her?

In the month since I first watched this movie, I’ve told everyone I know about it. I can’t stop thinking about it or talking about it.

Deals have been admittedly pretty dry since the holidays, but now that February is in full swing, we’re starting to see strong discounts return across a range of categories. In fact, thanks to Valentine’s Day, the Super Bowl, and — as of this weekend — Presidents Day, retailers are once again offering a slew of notable tech deals, making now a great time to shop if you’ve been holding off on making a larger purchase.

Although the Super Bowl and V-Day have technically come and gone, plenty of discounts are still around. A few have been rebranded for Presidents Day — including the discounts we recently saw on Sonos soundbars and speakers — but others are part of a new wave of limited-time deals, letting you save on OLED TVs, wireless earbuds, iPads, and other gadgets through the end of tomorrow, February 16th.

Below, we’ve rounded up the best Presidents Day deals we’ve seen so far. As in previous years, we’ll continue updating this list with new picks throughout the long weekend.

            <h2>The scientist using AI to hunt for antibiotics just about everywhere</h2>
            <p><strong>MIT Technology Review | 2026-02-16</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2026/02/16/1132516/cesar-de-la-fuente-using-ai-antibiotics-hunt/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">When he was just a teenager trying to decide what to do with his life, César de la Fuente compiled a list of the world’s biggest problems. He ranked them inversely by how much money governments were spending to solve them. Antimicrobial resistance topped the list.

Twenty years on, the problem has not gone away. If anything, it’s gotten worse. Infections caused by bacteria, fungi, and viruses that have evolved ways to evade treatments are now associated with more than 4 million deaths per year, and a recent analysis, published in the Lancet, predicts that number could surge past 8 million by 2050. In a July 2025 essay in Physical Review Letters, de la Fuente, now a bioengineer and computational biologist, and synthetic biologist James Collins warned of a looming “post­antibiotic” era in which infections from drug-resistant strains of common bacteria like Escherichia coli or Staphylococcus aureus, which can often still be treated by our current arsenal of medications, become fatal. “The antibiotic discovery pipeline remains perilously thin,” they wrote, “impeded by high development costs, lengthy timelines, and low returns on investment.”

But de la Fuente is using artificial intelligence to bring about a different future. His team at the University of Pennsylvania is training AI tools to search genomes far and deep for peptides with antibiotic properties. His vision is to assemble those peptides—molecules made of up to 50 amino acids linked together—into various configurations, including some never seen in nature. The results, he hopes, could defend the body against microbes that withstand traditional treatments.

His quest has unearthed promising candidates in unexpected places. In August 2025 his team, which includes 16 scientists in Penn’s Machine Biology Group, described peptides hiding in the genetic code of ancient single-celled organisms called archaea. Before that, they’d excavated a list of candidates from the venom of snakes, wasps, and spiders. And in an ongoing project de la Fuente calls “molecular de-­extinction,” he and his collaborators have been scanning published genetic sequences of extinct species for potentially functional molecules. Those species include hominids like Neanderthals and Denisovans and charismatic megafauna like woolly mammoths, as well as ancient zebras and penguins. In the history of life on Earth, de la Fuente reasons, maybe some organism evolved an antimicrobial defense that could be helpful today. Those long-gone codes have given rise to resurrected compounds with names like ­mammuthusin-2 (from woolly mammoth DNA), mylodonin-2 (from the giant sloth), and hydrodamin-1 (from the ancient sea cow). Over the last few years, this molecular binge has enabled de la Fuente to amass a library of more than a million genetic recipes.

At 40 years old, de la Fuente has also collected a trophy case of awards from the American Society for Microbiology, the American Chemical Society, and other organizations. (In 2019, this magazine named him one of “35 Innovators Under 35” for bringing computational approaches to antibiotic discovery.) He’s widely recognized as a leader in the effort to harness AI for real-world problems. “He’s really helped pioneer that space,” says Collins, who is at MIT. (The two have not collaborated in the laboratory, but Collins has long been at the forefront of using AI for drug discovery, including the search for antibiotics. In 2020, Collins’s team used an AI model to predict a broad-­spectrum antibiotic, halicin, that is now in preclinical development.)

The world of antibiotic development needs as much creativity and innovation as researchers can muster, says Collins. And de la Fuente’s work on peptides has pushed the field forward: “César is marvelously talented, very innovative.”

De la Fuente describes antimicrobial resistance as an “almost impossible” problem, but he sees plenty of room for exploration in the word almost. “I like challenges,” he says, “and I think this is the ultimate challenge.”

The use, overuse, and misuse of antibiotics, he says, drives antimicrobial resistance. And the problem is growing unchecked because conventional ways to find, make, and test the drugs are prohibitively expensive and often lead to dead ends. “A lot of the companies that have attempted to do antibiotic development in the past have ended up folding because there’s no good return on investment at the end of the day,” he says.

Antibiotic discovery has always been a messy, noisy endeavor, driven by serendipity and fraught with uncertainty and misdirection. For decades, researchers have largely relied on brute-force mechanical methods. “Scientists dig into soil, they dig into water,” says de la Fuente. “And then from that complex organic matter they try to extract antimicrobial molecules.”

But molecules can be extraordinarily complex. Researchers have estimated the number of possible organic combinations that could be synthesized at somewhere around 1060. For reference, Earth contains an estimated 1018 grains of sand. “Drug discovery in any domain is a statistics game,” says Jonathan Stokes, a chemical biologist at McMaster University in Canada, who has been using generative AI to design potential new antibiotics that can be synthesized in a lab, and who worked with Collins on halicin. “You need enough shots on goal to happen to get one.”

Those have to be good shots, though. And AI seems well suited to improving researchers’ aim. Biology is an information source, de la Fuente explains: “It’s like a bunch of code.” The code of DNA has four letters; proteins and peptides have 20, where each “letter” represents an amino acid. De la Fuente says his work amounts to training AI models to recognize sequences of letters that encode antimicrobial peptides, or AMPs. “If you think about it that way,” he says, “you can devise algorithms to mine the code and identify functional molecules, which can be antimicrobials. Or antimalarials. Or anticancer agents.”

Practically speaking, we’re still not there: These peptides haven’t yet been transformed into usable drugs that help people, and there are plenty of details—dosage, delivery, specific targets—that need to be sorted out, says de la Fuente. But AMPs are appealing because the body already uses them.They’re a critical part of the immune system and often the first line of defense against pathogenic infections. Unlike conventional antibiotics, which typically have one trick for killing bacteria, AMPs often exhibit a multimodal approach. They may disrupt the cell wall and the genetic material inside as well as a variety of cellular processes. A bacterial pathogen may evolve resistance to a conventional drug’s single mode of action, but maybe not to a multipronged AMP attack.

De la Fuente’s group is one of many pushing the boundaries of using AI for antibiotics. Where he focuses primarily on peptides, Collins works on small-molecule discovery. So does Stokes, at McMaster, whose models identify promising new molecules and predict whether they can be synthesized. “It’s only been a few years since folks have been using AI meaningfully in drug discovery,” says Collins.

Even in that short time the tools have changed, says James Zou, a computer scientist at Stanford University, who has worked with Stokes and Collins. Researchers have moved from using predictive models to developing generative approaches. With a predictive approach, Zou says, researchers screen large libraries of candidates that are known to be promising. Generative approaches offer something else: the appeal of designing a new molecule from scratch. Last year, for example, de la Fuente’s team used one generative AI model to design a suite of synthetic peptides and another to assess them. The group tested two of the resulting compounds on mice infected with a drug-resistant strain of Acinetobacter baumannii, a germ that the World Health Organization has identified as a “critical priority” in research on antimicrobial resistance. Both successfully and safely treated the infection.

But the field is still in the discovery phase. In his current work, de la Fuente is trying to get candidates closer to clinical testing. To that end, his team is developing an ambitious multimodal model called ApexOracle that’s designed to analyze a new pathogen, pinpoint its genetic weaknesses, match it to antimicrobial peptides that might work against it, and then predict how an antibiotic, built from those peptides, would fare in lab tests. It “converges understanding in chemistry, genomics, and language,” he says. It’s preliminary, he adds, but even if it doesn’t work perfectly, it will help steer the next generation of AI models toward the ultimate goal of resisting resistance.

Using AI, he believes, human researchers now have a fighting chance at catching up to the giant threat before them. The technology has already saved decades of human research time. Now he wants it to save lives, too: “This is the world that we live in today, and it’s incredible.”

            <h2>Hackers made death threats against this security researcher. Big mistake.</h2>
            <p><strong>MIT Technology Review | 2026-02-16</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2026/02/16/1132526/allison-nixon-hackers-security-researcher/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">In April 2024, a mysterious someone using the online handles “Waifu” and “Judische” began posting death threats on Telegram and Discord channels aimed at a cybersecurity researcher named Allison Nixon.

“Alison [sic] Nixon is gonna get necklaced with a tire filled with gasoline soon,” wrote Waifu/Judische, both of which are words with offensive connotations. “Decerebration is my fav type of brain death, thats whats gonna happen to alison Nixon.”

It wasn’t long before others piled on. Someone shared AI-generated nudes of Nixon.

These anonymous personas targeted Nixon because she had become a formidable threat: As chief research officer at the cyber investigations firm Unit 221B, named after Sherlock Holmes’s apartment, she had built a career tracking cybercriminals and helping get them arrested. For years she had lurked quietly in online chat channels or used pseudonyms to engage with perpetrators directly while piecing together clues they’d carelessly drop about themselves and their crimes. This had helped her bring to justice a number of cybercriminals—especially members of a loosely affiliated subculture of anarchic hackers who call themselves the Com.

But members of the Com aren’t just involved in hacking; some of them also engage in offline violence against researchers who track them. This includes bricking (throwing a brick through a victim’s window) and swatting (a dangerous type of hoax that involves reporting a false murder or hostage situation at someone’s home so SWAT teams will swarm it with guns drawn). Members of a Com offshoot known as 764 have been accused of even more violent acts—including animal torture, stabbings, and school shootings—or of inciting others in and outside the Com to commit these crimes.

Nixon started tracking members of the community more than a decade ago, when other researchers and people in law enforcement were largely ignoring them because they were young—many in their teens. Her early attention allowed her to develop strategies for unmasking them.

Ryan Brogan, a special agent with the FBI, says Nixon has helped him and colleagues identify and arrest more than two dozen members of the community since 2011, when he first began working with her, and that her skills in exposing them are unparalleled. “If you get on Allison’s and my radar, you’re going [down]. It’s just a matter of time,” he says. “No matter how much digital anonymity and tradecraft you try to apply, you’re done.”

Though she’d done this work for more than a decade, Nixon couldn’t understand why the person behind the Waifu/Judische accounts was suddenly threatening her. She had given media interviews about the Com—most recently on 60 Minutes—but not about her work unmasking members to get them arrested, so the hostility seemed to come out of the blue. And although she had taken an interest in the Waifu persona in years past for crimes he boasted about committing, he hadn’t been on her radar for a while when the threats began, because she was tracking other targets.

Now Nixon resolved to unmask Waifu/Judische and others responsible for the death threats—and take them down for crimes they admitted to committing. “Prior to them death-threatening me, I had no reason to pay attention to them,” she says.

Most people have never heard of the Com, but its influence and threat are growing.

It’s an online community comprising loosely affiliated groups of, primarily, teens and twentysomethings in North America and English-speaking parts of Europe who have become part of what some call a cybercrime youth movement.

International laws and norms, and fears of retaliation, prevent states from going all out in cyber operations. That doesn’t stop the anarchic Com.

Over the last decade, its criminal activities have escalated from simple distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks that disrupt websites to SIM-swapping hacks that hijack a victim’s phone service, as well as crypto theft, ransomware attacks, and corporate data theft. These crimes have affected AT&T, Microsoft, Uber, and others. Com members have also been involved in various forms of sextortion aimed at forcing victims to physically harm themselves or record themselves doing sexually explicit activities. The Com’s impact has also spread beyond the digital realm to kidnapping, beatings, and other violence.

One longtime cybercrime researcher, who asked to remain anonymous because of his work, says the Com is as big a threat in the cyber realm as Russia and China—for one unusual reason.

“There’s only so far that China is willing to go; there’s only so far that Russia or North Korea is willing to go,” he says, referring to international laws and norms, and fears of retaliation, that prevent states from going all out in cyber operations. That doesn’t stop the anarchic Com, he says.

“It is a pretty significant threat, and people tend to … push it under the rug [because] it’s just a bunch of kids,” he says. “But look at the impact [they have].”

Brogan says the amount of damage they do in terms of monetary losses “can become staggering very quickly.”

There is no single site where Com members congregate; they spread across a number of web forums and Telegram and Discord channels. The group follows a long line of hacking and subculture communities that emerged online over the last two decades, gained notoriety, and then faded or vanished after prominent members were arrested or other factors caused their decline. They differed in motivation and activity, but all emerged from “the same primordial soup,” says Nixon. The Com’s roots can be traced to the Scene, which began as a community of various “warez” groups engaged in pirating computer games, music, and movies.

When Nixon began looking at the Scene, in 2011, its members were hijacking gaming accounts, launching DDoS attacks, and running booter services. (DDoS attacks overwhelm a server or computer with traffic from bot-controlled machines, preventing legitimate traffic from getting through; booters are tools that anyone can rent to launch a DDoS attack against a target of choice.) While they made some money, their primary goal was notoriety.

This changed around 2018. Cryptocurrency values were rising, and the Com—or the Community, as it sometimes called itself—emerged as a subgroup that ultimately took over the Scene. Members began to focus on financial gain—cryptocurrency theft, data theft, and extortion.

The pandemic two years later saw a surge in Com membership that Nixon attributes to social isolation and the forced movement of kids online for schooling. But she believes economic conditions and socialization problems have also driven its growth. Many Com members can’t get jobs because they lack skills or have behavioral issues, she says. A number who have been arrested have had troubled home lives and difficulty adapting to school, and some have shown signs of mental illness. The Com provides camaraderie, support, and an outlet for personal frustrations. Since 2018, it has also offered some a solution to their money problems.

Loose-knit cells have sprouted from the community—Star Fraud, ShinyHunters, Scattered Spider, Lapsus$—to collaborate on clusters of crime. They usually target high-profile crypto bros and tech giants and have made millions of dollars from theft and extortion, according to court records.

But dominance, power, and bragging rights are still motivators, even in profit operations, says the cybercrime researcher, which is partly why members target “big whales.”

“There is financial gain,” he says, “but it’s also [sending a message that] I can reach out and touch the people that think they’re untouchable.” In fact, Nixon says, some members of the Com have overwhelming ego-driven motivations that end up conflicting with their financial motives.

“Often their financial schemes fall apart because of their ego, and that phenomenon is also what I’ve made my career on,” she says.

Nixon has straight dark hair, wears wire-rimmed glasses, and has a slight build and bookish demeanor that, on first impression, could allow her to pass for a teen herself. She talks about her work in rapid cadences, like someone whose brain is filled with facts that are under pressure to get out, and she exudes a sense of urgency as she tries to make people understand the threat the Com poses. She doesn’t suppress her happiness when someone she’s been tracking gets arrested.

In 2011, when she first began investigating the communities from which the Com emerged, she was working the night shift in the security operations center of the security firm SecureWorks. The center responded to tickets and security alerts emanating from customer networks, but Nixon coveted a position on the company’s counter-threats team, which investigated and published threat-intelligence reports on mostly state-sponsored hacking groups from China and Russia. Without connections or experience, she had no path to investigative work. But Nixon is an intensely curious person, and this created its own path.

Where the threat team focused on the impact hackers had on customer networks—how they broke in, what they stole—Nixon was more interested in their motivations and the personality traits that drove their actions. She assumed there must be online forums where criminal hackers congregated, so she googled “hacking forums” and landed on a site called Hack Forums.

She was surprised to see members openly discussing their crimes there. She reached out to someone on the SecureWorks threat team to see if he was aware of the site, and he dismissed it as a place for “script kiddies”—a pejorative term for unskilled hackers.

This was a time when many cybersecurity pros were shifting their focus away from cybercrime to state-sponsored hacking operations, which were more sophisticated and getting a lot of attention. But Nixon likes to zig where others zag, and her colleague’s dismissiveness fueled her interest in the forums. Two other SecureWorks colleagues shared that interest, and the three studied the forums during downtime on their shifts. They focused on trying to identify the people running DDoS booters.

What Nixon loved about the forums was how accessible they were to a beginner like herself. Threat-intelligence teams require privileged access to a victim’s network to investigate breaches. But Nixon could access everything she needed in the public forums, where the hackers seemed to think no one was watching. Because of this, they often made mistakes in operational security, or OPSEC—letting slip little biographical facts such as the city where they lived, a school they attended, or a place they used to work. These details revealed in their chats, combined with other information, could help expose the real identities behind their anonymous masks.

“It was a shock to me that it was relatively easy to figure out who [they were],” she says.

She wasn’t bothered by the immature boasting and petty fights that dominated the forums. “A lot of people don’t like to do this work of reading chat logs. I realize that this is a very uncommon thing. And maybe my brain is built a little weird that I’m willing to do this,” she says. “I have a special talent that I can wade through garbage and it doesn’t bother me.”

Nixon soon realized that not all the members were script kiddies. Some exhibited real ingenuity and “powerful” skills, she says, but because they were applying these to frivolous purposes—hijacking gamer accounts instead of draining bank accounts—researchers and law enforcement were ignoring them. Nixon began tracking them, suspecting that they would eventually direct their skills at more significant targets—an intuition that proved to be correct. And when they did, she had already amassed a wealth of information about them.

She continued her DDoS research for two years until a turning point in 2013, when the cybersecurity journalist Brian Krebs, who made a career tracking cybercriminals, got swatted.

About a dozen people from the security community worked with Krebs to expose the perpetrator, and Nixon was invited to help. Krebs sent her pieces of the puzzle to investigate, and eventually the group identified the culprit (though it would take two years for him to be arrested). When she was invited to dinner with Krebs and the other investigators, she realized she’d found her people.

“It was an amazing moment for me,” she says. “I was like, wow, there’s all these like-minded people that just want to help and are doing it just for the love of the game, basically.”

It was porn stars who provided Nixon with her next big research focus—one that underscored her skill at spotting Com actors and criminal trends in their nascent stages, before they emerged as major threats.

In 2018, someone was hijacking the social media accounts of certain adult-film stars and using those accounts to blast out crypto scams to their large follower bases. Nixon couldn’t figure out how the hackers had hijacked the social media profiles, but she promised to help the actors regain access to their accounts if they agreed to show her the private messages the hackers had sent or received during the time they controlled them. These messages led her to a forum where members were talking about how they stole the accounts. The hackers had tricked some of these actors into disclosing the mobile phone numbers of others. Then they used a technique called SIM swapping to reset passwords for social media accounts belonging to those other stars, locking them out.

In SIM swapping, fraudsters get a victim’s phone number assigned to a SIM card and phone they control, so that calls and messages intended for the victim go to them instead. This includes one-time security codes that sites text to account holders to verify themselves when accessing their account or changing its password. In some of the cases involving the porn stars, the hackers had manipulated telecom workers into making the SIM swaps for what they thought were legitimate reasons, and in other cases they bribed the workers to make the change. The hackers were then able to alter the password on the actors’ social media accounts, lock out the owners, and use the accounts to advertise their crypto scams.

SIM swapping is a powerful technique that can be used to hijack and drain entire cryptocurrency and bank accounts, so Nixon was surprised to see the fraudsters using it for relatively unprofitable schemes. But SIM swapping had rarely been used for financial fraud at that point, and like the earlier hackers Nixon had seen on Hack Forums, the ones hijacking porn star accounts didn’t seem to grasp the power of the technique they were using. Nixon suspected that this would change and SIM swapping would soon become a major problem, so she shifted her research focus accordingly. It didn’t take long for the fraudsters to pivot as well.

Nixon’s skill at looking ahead in this way has served her throughout her career. On multiple occasions a hacker or hacking group would catch her attention—for using a novel hacking approach in some minor operation, for example—and she’d begin tracking their online posts and chats in the belief that they’d eventually do something significant with that skill.

They usually did. When they later grabbed headlines with a showy or impactful operation, these hackers would seem to others to have emerged from nowhere, sending researchers and law enforcement scrambling to understand who they were. But Nixon would already have a dossier compiled on them and, in some cases, had unmasked their real identity as well. Lizard Squad was an example of this. The group burst into the headlines in 2014 and 2015 with a series of high-profile DDoS campaigns, but Nixon and colleagues at the job where she worked at the time had already been watching its members as individuals for a while. So the FBI sought their assistance in identifying them.

“The thing about these young hackers is that they … keep going until they get arrested, but it takes years for them to get arrested,” she says. “So a huge aspect of my career is just sitting on this information that has not been actioned [yet].”

It was during the Lizard Squad years that Nixon began developing tools to scrape and record hacker communications online, though it would be years before she began using these concepts to scrape the Com chatrooms and forums. These channels held a wealth of data that might not seem useful during the nascent stage of a hacker’s career but could prove critical later, when law enforcement got around to investigating them; yet the contents were always at risk of being deleted by Com members or getting taken down by law enforcement when it seized websites and chat channels.

Nixon’s work is unique because she engages with the actors in chat spaces to draw out information from them that “would not be otherwise normally available.”

Over several years, she scraped and preserved whatever chatrooms she was investigating. But it wasn’t until early 2020, when she joined Unit 221B, that she got the chance to scrape the Telegram and Discord channels of the Com. She pulled all of this data together into a searchable platform that other researchers and law enforcement could use. The company hired two former hackers to help build scraping tools and infrastructure for this work; the result is eWitness, a community-driven, invitation-­only platform. It was initially seeded only with data Nixon had collected after she arrived at Unit 221B, but has since been augmented with data that other users of the platform have scraped from Com social spaces as well, some of which doesn’t exist in public forums anymore.

Brogan, of the FBI, says it’s an incredibly valuable tool, made more so by Nixon’s own contributions. Other security firms scrape online criminal spaces as well, but they seldom share the content with outsiders, and Brogan says Nixon’s work is unique because she engages with the actors in chat spaces to draw out information from them that “would not be otherwise normally available.”

The preservation project she started when she got to Unit 221B could not have been better timed, because it coincided with the pandemic, the surge in new Com membership, and the emergence of two disturbing Com offshoots, CVLT and 764. She was able to capture their chats as these groups first emerged; after law enforcement arrested leaders of the groups and took control of the servers where their chats were posted, this material went offline.

CVLT—pronounced “cult”—was reportedly founded around 2019 with a focus on sextortion and child sexual abuse material. 764 emerged from CVLT and was spearheaded by a 15-year-old in Texas named Bradley Cadenhead, who named it after the first digits of his zip code. Its focus was extremism and violence.

In 2021, because of what she observed in these groups, Nixon turned her attention to sextortion among Com members.

The type of sextortion they engaged in has its roots in activity that began a decade ago as “fan signing.” Hackers would use the threat of doxxing to coerce someone, usually a young female, into writing the hacker’s handle on a piece of paper. The hacker would use a photo of it as an avatar on his online accounts—a kind of trophy. Eventually some began blackmailing victims into writing the hacker’s handle on their face, breasts, or genitals. With CVLT, this escalated even further; targets were blackmailed into carving a Com member’s name into their skin or engaging in sexually explicit acts while recording or livestreaming themselves.

During the pandemic a surprising number of SIM swappers crossed into child sexual abuse material and sadistic sextortion, according to Nixon. She hates tracking this gruesome activity, but she saw an opportunity to exploit it for good. She had long been frustrated at how leniently judges treated financial fraudsters because of their crimes’ seemingly nonviolent nature. But she saw a chance to get harsher sentences for them if she could tie them to their sextortion and began to focus on these crimes.

At this point, Waifu still wasn’t on her radar. But that was about to change.

Nixon landed in Waifu’s crosshairs after he and fellow members of the Com were involved in a large hack involving AT&T customer call records in April 2024.

Waifu’s group gained access to dozens of cloud accounts with Snowflake, a company that provides online data storage for customers. One of those customers had more than 50 billion call logs of AT&T wireless subscribers stored in its Snowflake account.

They tried to re-extort the telecom, threatening on social media to leak the records. They tagged the FBI in the post. “It’s like they were begging to be investigated,” says Nixon.

Among the subscriber records were call logs for FBI agents who were AT&T customers. Nixon and other researchers believe the hackers may have been able to identify the phone numbers of agents through other means. Then they may have used a reverse-lookup program to identify the owners of phone numbers that the agents called or that called them and found Nixon’s number among them. This is when they began harassing her.

But then they got reckless. They allegedly extorted nearly $400,000 from AT&T in exchange for promising to delete the call records they’d stolen. Then they tried to re-extort the telecom, threatening on social media to leak the records they claimed to have deleted if it didn’t pay more. They tagged the FBI in the post.

“It’s like they were begging to be investigated,” says Nixon.

The Snowflake breaches and AT&T records theft were grabbing headlines at the time, but Nixon had no idea her number was in the stolen logs or that Waifu/Judische was a prime suspect in the breaches. So she was perplexed when he started taunting and threatening her online.

Over several weeks in May and June, a pattern developed. Waifu or one of his associates would post a threat against her and then post a message online inviting her to talk. She assumes now that they believed she was helping law enforcement investigate the Snowflake breaches and hoped to draw her into a dialogue to extract information from her about what authorities knew. But Nixon wasn’t helping the FBI investigate them yet. It was only after she began looking at Waifu for the threats that she became aware of his suspected role in the Snowflake hack.

It wasn’t the first time she had studied him, though. Waifu had come to her attention in 2019 when he bragged about framing another Com member for a hoax bomb threat and later talked about his involvement in SIM-swapping operations. He made an impression on her. He clearly had technical skills, but Nixon says he also often appeared immature, impulsive, and emotionally unstable, and he was desperate for attention in his interactions with other members. He bragged about not needing sleep and using Adderall to hack through the night. He was also a bit reckless about protecting personal details. He wrote in private chats to another researcher that he would never get caught because he was good at OPSEC, but he also told the researcher that he lived in Canada—which turned out to be true.

Nixon’s process for unmasking Waifu followed a general recipe she used to unmask Com members: She’d draw a large investigative circle around a target and all the personas that communicated with that person online, and then study their interactions to narrow the circle to the people with the most significant connections to the target. Some of the best leads came from a target’s enemies; she could glean a lot of information about their identity, personality, and activities from what the people they fought with online said about them.

“The enemies and the ex-girlfriends, generally speaking, are the best [for gathering intelligence on a suspect],” she says. “I love them.”

While she was doing this, Waifu and his group were reaching out to other security researchers, trying to glean information about Nixon and what she might be investigating. They also attempted to plant false clues with the researchers by dropping the names of other cybercriminals in Canada who could plausibly be Waifu. Nixon had never seen cybercriminals engage in counterintelligence tactics like this.

Amid this subterfuge and confusion, Nixon and another researcher working with her did a lot of consulting and cross-checking with other researchers about the clues they were gathering to ensure they had the right name before they gave it to the FBI.

By July she and the researcher were convinced they had their guy: Connor Riley Moucka, a 25-year-old high school dropout living with his grandfather in Ontario. On October 30, Royal Canadian Mounted Police converged on Moucka’s home and arrested him.

According to an affidavit filed in Canadian court, a plainclothes Canadian police officer visited Moucka’s house under some pretense on the afternoon of October 21, nine days before the arrest, to secretly capture a photo of him and compare it with an image US authorities had provided. The officer knocked and rang the bell; Moucka opened the door looking disheveled and told the visitor: “You woke me up, sir.” He told the officer his name was Alex; Moucka sometimes used the alias Alexander Antonin Moucka. Satisfied that the person who answered the door was the person the US was seeking, the officer left. Waifu’s online rants against Nixon escalated at this point, as did his attempts at misdirection. She believes the visit to his door spooked him.

Nixon won’t say exactly how they unmasked Moucka—only that he made a mistake.

“I don’t want to train these people in how to not get caught [by revealing his error],” she says.

The Canadian affidavit against Moucka reveals a number of other violent posts he’s alleged to have made online beyond the threats he made against her. Some involve musings about becoming a serial killer or mass-mailing sodium nitrate pills to Black people in Michigan and Ohio; in another, his online persona talks about obtaining firearms to “kill Canadians” and commit “suicide by cop.”

Prosecutors, who list Moucka’s online aliases as including Waifu, Judische, and two more in the indictment, say he and others extorted at least $2.5 million from at least three victims whose data they stole from Snowflake accounts. Moucka has been charged with nearly two dozen counts, including conspiracy, unauthorized access to computers, extortion, and wire fraud. He has pleaded not guilty and was extradited to the US last July. His trial is scheduled for October this year, though hacking cases usually end in plea agreements rather than going to trial.

It took months for authorities to arrest Moucka after Nixon and her colleague shared their findings with the authorities, but an alleged associate of his in the Snowflake conspiracy, a US Army soldier named Cameron John Wagenius (Kiberphant0m online), was arrested more quickly.

On November 10, 2024, Nixon and her team found a mistake Wagenius made that helped identify him, and on December 20 he was arrested. Wagenius has already pleaded guilty to two charges around the sale or attempted sale of confidential phone records and will be sentenced this March.

These days Nixon continues to investigate sextortion among Com members. But she says that remaining members of Waifu’s group still taunt and threaten her.

“They are continuing to persist in their nonsense, and they are getting taken out one by one,” she says. “And I’m just going to keep doing that until there’s no one left on that side.”

            <p><strong>MIT Technology Review | 2026-02-13</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2026/02/13/1132913/als-stole-this-musicians-voice-ai-sing/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">There are tears in the audience as Patrick Darling’s song begins to play. It’s a heartfelt song written for his great-grandfather, whom he never got the chance to meet. But this performance is emotional for another reason: It’s Darling’s first time on stage with his bandmates since he lost the ability to sing two years ago.

The 32-year-old musician was diagnosed with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) when he was 29 years old. Like other types of motor neuron disease (MND), it affects nerves that supply the body’s muscles. People with ALS eventually lose the ability to control their muscles, including those that allow them to move, speak, and breathe.

Darling’s last stage performance was over two years ago. By that point, he had already lost the ability to stand and play his instruments and was struggling to sing or speak. But recently, he was able to re-create his lost voice using an AI tool trained on snippets of old audio recordings. Another AI tool has enabled him to use this “voice clone” to compose new songs. Darling is able to make music again.

“Sadly, I have lost the ability to sing and play my instruments,” Darling said on stage at the event, which took place in London on Wednesday, using his voice clone. “Despite this, most of my time these days is spent still continuing to compose and produce my music. Doing so feels more important than ever to me now.”

Darling says he’s been a musician and a composer since he was around 14 years old. “I learned to play bass guitar, acoustic guitar, piano, melodica, mandolin, and tenor banjo,” he said at the event. “My biggest love, though, was singing.”

He met bandmate Nick Cocking over 10 years ago, while he was still a university student, says Cocking. Darling joined Cocking’s Irish folk outfit, the Ceili House Band, shortly afterwards, and their first gig together was in April 2014. Darling, who joined the band as a singer and guitarist, “elevated the musicianship of the band,” says Cocking.

But a few years ago, Cocking and his other bandmates started noticing changes in Darling. He became clumsy, says Cocking. He recalls one night when the band had to walk across the city of Cardiff in the rain: “He just kept slipping and falling, tripping on paving slabs and things like that.”

He didn’t think too much of it at the time, but Darling’s symptoms continued to worsen. The disease affected his legs first, and in August 2023, he started needing to sit during performances. Then he started to lose the use of his hands. “Eventually he couldn’t play the guitar or the banjo anymore,” says Cocking.

By April 2024, Darling was struggling to talk and breathe at the same time, says Cocking. For that performance, the band carried Darling on stage. “He called me the day after and said he couldn’t do it anymore,” Cocking says, his voice breaking. “By June 2024, it was done.” It was the last time the band played together.

Darling was put in touch with a speech therapist, who raised the possibility of “banking” his voice. People who are losing the ability to speak can opt to record themselves speaking and use those recordings to create speech sounds that can then be activated with typed text, whether by hand or perhaps using a device controlled by eye movements.

Some users have found these tools to be robotic sounding. But Darling had another issue. “By that stage, my voice had already changed,” he said at the event. “It felt like we were saving the wrong voice.”

Then another speech therapist introduced him to a different technology. Richard Cave is a speech and language therapist and a researcher at University College London. He is also a consultant for ElevenLabs, an AI company that develops agents and audio, speech, video, and music tools. One of these tools can create “voice clones”—realistic mimics of real voices that can be generated from minutes, or even seconds, of a person’s recorded voice.

Last year, ElevenLabs launched an impact program with a promise to provide free licenses to these tools for people who have lost their voices to ALS or other diseases, like head and neck cancer or stroke.

The tool is already helping some of those users. “We’re not really improving how quickly they’re able to communicate, or all of the difficulties that individuals with MND are going through physically, with eating and breathing,” says Gabi Leibowitz, a speech therapist who leads the program. “But what we are doing is giving them a way … to create again, to thrive.” Users are able to stay in their jobs longer and “continue to do the things that make them feel like human beings,” she says.

Cave worked with Darling to use the tool to re-create his lost speaking voice from older recordings.

“The first time I heard the voice, I thought it was amazing,” Darling said at the event, using the voice clone. “It sounded exactly like I had before, and you literally wouldn’t be able to tell the difference,” he said. “I will not say what the first word I made my new voice say, but I can tell you that it began with ‘f’ and ended in ‘k.’”

Re-creating his singing voice wasn’t as easy. The tool typically requires around 10 minutes of clear audio to generate a clone. “I had no high-quality recordings of myself singing,” Darling said. “We had to use audio from videos on people’s phones, shot in noisy pubs, and a couple of recordings of me singing in my kitchen.” Still, those snippets were enough to create a “synthetic version of [Darling’s] singing voice,” says Cave.

In the recordings, Darling sounded a little raspy and “was a bit off” on some of the notes, says Cave. The voice clone has the same qualities. It doesn’t sound perfect, Cave says—it sounds human.

“The ElevenLabs voice that we’ve created is wonderful,” Darling said at the event. “It definitely sounds like me—[it] just kind of feels like a different version of me.”

ElevenLabs has also developed an AI music generator called Eleven Music. The tool allows users to compose tracks, using text prompts to choose the musical style. Several well-known artists have also partnered with the company to license AI clones of their voices, including the actor Michael Caine, whose voice clone is being used to narrate an upcoming ElevenLabs documentary. Last month, the company released an album of 11 tracks created using the tool. “The Liza Minnelli track is really a banger,” says Cave.

Eleven Music can generate a song in a minute, but Darling and Cave spent around six weeks fine-tuning Darling’s song. Using text prompts, any user can “create music and add lyrics in any style [they like],” says Cave. Darling likes Irish folk, but Cave has also worked with a man in Colombia who is creating Colombian folk music. (The ElevenLabs tool is currently available in 74 languages.)

Last month, Cocking got a call from Cave, who sent him Darling’s completed track. “I heard the first two or three words he sang, and I had to turn it off,” he says. “I was just in bits, in tears. It took me a good half a dozen times to make it to the end of the track.”

Darling and Cave were making plans to perform the track live at the ElevenLabs summit in London on Wednesday, February 11. So Cocking and bandmate Hari Ma each arranged accompanying parts to play on the mandolin and fiddle. They had a couple of weeks to rehearse before they joined Darling on stage, two years after their last performance together.

“I wheeled him out on stage, and neither of us could believe it was happening,” says Cave. “He was thrilled.” The song was played as Darling remained on stage, and Cocking and Ma played their instruments live.

Cocking and Cave say Darling plans to continue to use the tools to make music. Cocking says he hopes to perform with Darling again but acknowledges that, given the nature of ALS, it is difficult to make long-term plans.

“It’s so bittersweet,” says Cocking. “But getting up on stage and seeing Patrick there filled me with absolute joy. I know Patrick really enjoyed it as well. We’ve been talking about it … He was really, really proud.”

US deputy health secretary: Vaccine guidelines are still subject to change

Over the past year, Jim O’Neill has become one of the most powerful people in public health. As the US deputy health secretary, he holds two roles at the top of the country’s federal health and science agencies. He oversees a department with a budget of over a trillion dollars. And he signed the decision memorandum on the US’s deeply controversial new vaccine schedule.He’s also a longevity enthusiast. In an exclusive interview with MIT Technology Review earlier this month, O’Neill described his plans to increase human healthspan through longevity-focused research supported by ARPA-H, a federal agency dedicated to biomedical breakthroughs. Fellow longevity enthusiasts said they hope he will bring attention and funding to their cause.

At the same time, O’Neill defended reducing the number of broadly recommended childhood vaccines, a move that has been widely criticized by experts in medicine and public health. Read the full story.

Making a movie is a lot like pulling off a heist. That’s what Steven Soderbergh—director of the Ocean’s franchise, among other heist-y classics—said a few years ago. You come up with a creative angle, put together a team of specialists, figure out how to beat the technological challenges, rehearse, move with Swiss-watch precision, and—if you do it right—redistribute some wealth.

But conversely, pulling off a heist isn’t much like the movies. Surveillance cameras, computer-controlled alarms, knockout gas, and lasers hardly ever feature in big-ticket crime. In reality, technical countermeasures are rarely a problem, and high-tech gadgets are rarely a solution. Read the full story.

RFK Jr. follows a carnivore diet. That doesn’t mean you should.

Americans have a new set of diet guidelines. Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has taken an old-fashioned food pyramid, turned it upside down, and plonked a steak and a stick of butter in prime positions.

Kennedy and his Make America Healthy Again mates have long been extolling the virtues of meat and whole-fat dairy, so it wasn’t too surprising to see those foods recommended alongside vegetables and whole grains (despite the well-established fact that too much saturated fat can be extremely bad for you).Some influencers have taken the meat trend to extremes, following a “carnivore diet.” A recent review of research into nutrition misinformation on social media found that a lot of shared diet information is nonsense. But what’s new is that some of this misinformation comes from the people who now lead America’s federal health agencies. Read the full story.

            <div id="article-text">Making a movie is a lot like pulling off a heist. That’s what Steven Soderbergh—director of the Ocean’s franchise, among other heist-y classics—said a few years ago. You come up with a creative angle, put together a team of specialists, figure out how to beat the technological challenges, rehearse, move with Swiss-watch precision, and—if you do it right—redistribute some wealth. That could describe either the plot or the making of Ocean’s Eleven.

But conversely, pulling off a heist isn’t much like the movies. Surveillance cameras, computer-controlled alarms, knockout gas, and lasers hardly ever feature in big-ticket crime. In reality, technical countermeasures are rarely a problem, and high-tech gadgets are rarely a solution. The main barrier to entry is usually a literal barrier to entry, like a door. Thieves’ most common move is to collude with, trick, or threaten an insider. Last year a heist cost the Louvre €88 million worth of antique jewelry, and the most sophisticated technology in play was an angle grinder.

The low-tech Louvre maneuvers were in keeping with what heist research long ago concluded. In 2014 US nuclear weapons researchers at Sandia National Laboratories took a detour into this demimonde, producing a 100-page report called “The Perfect Heist: Recipes from Around the World.” The scientists were worried someone might try to steal a nuke from the US arsenal, and so they compiled information on 23 high-value robberies from 1972 to 2012 into a “Heist Methods and Characteristics Database,” a critical mass of knowledge on what worked. Thieves, they found, dedicated huge amounts of money and time to planning and practice runs—sometimes more than 100. They’d use brute force, tunneling through sewers for months (Société Générale bank heist, Nice, France, 1976), or guile, donning police costumes to fool guards (Gardner Museum, Boston, 1990). But nobody was using, say, electromagnetic pulse generators to shut down the Las Vegas electrical grid. The most successful robbers got to the valuable stuff unseen and got out fast.

Advance the time frame, and the situation looks much the same. Last year, Spanish researchers looking at art crimes from 1990 to 2022 found that the least technical methods are still the most successful. “High-tech technology doesn’t work so well,” says Erin L. Thompson, an art historian at John Jay College of Justice who studies art crime. Speed and practice trump complicated systems and alarms; even that Louvre robbery was, at heart, just a minutes-long smash-and-grab.

An emphasis on speed doesn’t mean heists don’t require skill—panache, even. As the old saying goes, amateurs talk strategy; professionals study logistics. Even without gadgets, heists and heist movies still revel in an engineer’s mindset. “Heist movies absolutely celebrate deep-dive nerdery—‘I’m going to know everything I can about the power grid, about this kind of stone and drill, about Chicago at night,’” says Anna Kornbluh, a professor of English at the University of Illinois at Chicago. She published a paper last October on the ways heist movies reflect an Old Hollywood approach to collective art-making, while shows about new grift, like those detailing the rise and fall of WeWork or the con artist Anna Delvey, reflect the more lone-wolf, disrupt-and-grow mindset of the streaming era.

Her work might help explain why law-abiding citizens might cheer for the kinds of guys who’d steal a crown from the Louvre, or $100,000 worth of escargot from a farm in Champagne (as happened just a few weeks later). Heists, says Kornbluh, are anti-oligarch praxis. “Everybody wants to know how to be in a competent collective. Everybody wants there to be better logistics,” she says. “We need a better state. We need a better society. We need a better world.” Those are shared values—and as another old saying tells us, where there is value, there is crime.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Following publication of this story, Politico reported Jim O’Neill would be leaving his current roles within the Department of Health and Human Services.

Over the past year, Jim O’Neill has become one of the most powerful people in public health. As the US deputy health secretary, he holds two roles at the top of the country’s federal health and science agencies. He oversees a department with a budget of over a trillion dollars. And he signed the decision memorandum on the US’s deeply controversial new vaccine schedule.

He’s also a longevity enthusiast. In an exclusive interview with MIT Technology Review earlier this month, O’Neill described his plans to increase human healthspan through longevity-focused research supported by ARPA-H, a federal agency dedicated to biomedical breakthroughs. At the same time, he defended reducing the number of broadly recommended childhood vaccines, a move that has been widely criticized by experts in medicine and public health.

In MIT Technology Review’s profile of O’Neill last year, people working in health policy and consumer advocacy said they found his libertarian views on drug regulation “worrisome” and “antithetical to basic public health.”

He was later named acting director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, putting him in charge of the nation’s public health agency.

But fellow longevity enthusiasts said they hope O’Neill will bring attention and funding to their cause: the search for treatments that might slow, prevent, or even reverse human aging. Here are some takeaways from the interview.

Last month, the US cut the number of vaccines recommended for children. The CDC no longer recommends vaccinations against flu, rotavirus, hepatitis A, or meningococcal disease for all children. The move was widely panned by medical groups and public health experts. Many worry it will become more difficult for children to access those vaccines. The majority of states have rejected the recommendations.

In the confirmation hearing for his role as deputy secretary of health and human services, which took place in May last year, O’Neill said he supported the CDC’s vaccine schedule. MIT Technology Review asked him if that was the case and, if so, what made him change his mind. “Researching and examining and reviewing safety data and efficacy data about vaccines is one of CDC’s obligations,” he said. “CDC gives important advice about vaccines and should always be open to new data and new ways of looking at data.”

At the beginning of December, O’Neill said, President Donald Trump “asked me to look at what other countries were doing in terms of their vaccine schedules.” He said he spoke to health ministries of other countries and consulted with scientists at the CDC and FDA. “It was suggested to me by lots of the operating divisions that the US focus its recommendations on consensus vaccines of other developed nations—in other words, the most important vaccines that are most often part of the core recommendations of other countries,” he said.

“As a result of that, we did an update to the vaccine schedule to focus on a set of vaccines that are most important for all children.”

But some experts in public health have said that countries like Denmark and Japan, whose vaccine schedules the new US one was supposedly modeled on, are not really comparable to the US. When asked about these criticisms, O’Neill replied, “A lot of parents feel that … more than 70 vaccine doses given to young children sounds like a really high number, and some of them ask which ones are the most important. I think we helped answer that question in a way that didn’t remove anyone’s access.”

A few weeks after the vaccine recommendations were changed, Kirk Milhoan, who leads the CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, said that vaccinations for measles and polio—which are currently required for entry to public schools—should be optional. (Mehmet Oz, the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services director, has more recently urged people to “take the [measles] vaccine.”)

“CDC still recommends that all children are vaccinated against diphtheria, tetanus, whooping cough, Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib), Pneumococcal conjugate, polio, measles, mumps, rubella, and human papillomavirus (HPV), for which there is international consensus, as well as varicella (chickenpox),” he said when asked for his thoughts on this comment.

He also said that current vaccine guidelines are “still subject to new data coming in, new ways of thinking about things.” “CDC, FDA, and NIH are initiating new studies of the safety of immunizations,” he added. “We will continue to ask the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices to review evidence and make updated recommendations with rigorous science and transparency.”

O’Neill said he wants longevity to become a priority for US health agencies. His ultimate goal, he said, is to “make the damage of aging something that’s under medical control.” It’s “the same way of thinking” as the broader Make America Healthy Again approach, he said: “‘Again’ implies restoration of health, which is what longevity research and therapy is all about.”

O’Neill said his interest in longevity was ignited by his friend Peter Thiel, the billionaire tech entrepreneur, around 2008 to 2009. It was right around the time O’Neill was finishing up a previous role in HHS, under the Bush administration. O’Neill said Thiel told him he “should really start looking into longevity and the idea that aging damage could be reversible.” “I just got more and more excited about that idea,” he said.

When asked if he’s heard of Vitalism, a philosophical movement for “hardcore” longevity enthusiasts who, broadly, believe that death is wrong, O’Neill replied: “Yes.”

The Vitalist declaration lists five core statements, including “Death is humanity’s core problem,” “Obviating aging is scientifically plausible,” and “I will carry the message against aging and death.” O’Neill said he agrees with all of them. “I suppose I am [a Vitalist],” he said with a smile, although he’s not a paying member of the foundation behind it.

As deputy secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services, O’Neill assumes a level of responsibility for huge and influential science and health agencies, including the National Institutes of Health (the world’s largest public funder of biomedical research) and the Food and Drug Administration (which oversees drug regulation and is globally influential) as well as the CDC.

Today, he said, he sees support for longevity science from his colleagues within HHS. “If I could describe one common theme to the senior leadership at HHS, obviously it’s to make America healthy again, and reversing aging damage is all about making people healthy again,” he said. “We are refocusing HHS on addressing and reversing chronic disease, and chronic diseases are what drive aging, broadly.”

Over the last year, thousands of NIH grants worth over $2 billion were frozen or terminated, including funds for research on cancer biology, health disparities, neuroscience, and much more. When asked whether any of that funding will be restored, he did not directly address the question, instead noting: “You’ll see a lot of funding more focused on important priorities that actually improve people’s health.”

He promised we’ll hear more from ARPA-H, the three-year-old federal agency dedicated to achieving breakthroughs in medical science and biotechnology. It was established with the official goal of promoting “high-risk, high-reward innovation for the development and translation of transformative health technologies.”

O’Neill said that “ARPA-H exists to make the impossible possible in health and medicine.” The agency has a new director—Alicia Jackson, who formerly founded and led a company focused on women’s health and longevity, took on the role in October last year.

O’Neill said he helped recruit Jackson, and that she was hired in part because of her interest in longevity, which will now become a major focus of the agency. He said he meets with her regularly, as well as with Andrew Brack and Jean Hébert, two other longevity supporters who lead departments at ARPA-H. Brack’s program focuses on finding biological markers of aging. Hebert’s aim is to find a way to replace aging brain tissue, bit by bit.

O’Neill is especially excited by that one, he said. “I would try it … Not today, but … if progress goes in a broadly good direction, I would be open to it. We’re hoping to see significant results in the next few years.”

He’s also enthused by the idea of creating all-new organs for transplantation. “Someday we want to be able to grow new organs, ideally from the patients’ own cells,” O’Neill said. An ARPA-H program will receive $170 million over five years to that end, he adds. “I’m very excited about the potential of ARPA-H and Alicia and Jean and Andrew to really push things forward.”

O’Neill said he also regularly talks to the team at the lobbying group Alliance for Longevity Initiatives. The organization, led by Dylan Livingston, played an instrumental role in changing state law in Montana to make experimental therapies more accessible. O’Neill said he hasn’t formally worked with them but thinks that “they’re doing really good work on raising awareness, including on Capitol Hill.”

Livingston has told me that A4LI’s main goals center around increasing support for aging research (possibly via the creation of a new NIH institute entirely dedicated to the subject) and changing laws to make it easier and cheaper to develop and access potential anti-aging therapies.

O’Neill gave the impression that the first goal might be a little overambitious—the number of institutes is down to Congress, he said. “I would like to get really all of the institutes at NIH to think more carefully about how many chronic diseases are usefully thought of as pathologies of aging damage,” he said. There’ll be more federal funding for that research, he said, although he won’t say more for now.

Some members of the longevity community have more radical ideas when it comes to regulation: they want to create their own jurisdictions designed to fast-track the development of longevity drugs and potentially encourage biohacking and self-experimentation.

It&#39;s a concept that O’Neill has expressed support for in the past. He has posted on X about his support for limiting the role of government, and in support of building “freedom cities”—a similar concept that involves creating new cities on federal land.

Another longevity enthusiast who supports the concept is Niklas Anzinger, a German tech entrepreneur who is now based in Próspera, a private city within a Honduran “special economic zone,” where residents can make their own suggestions for medical regulations. Anzinger also helped draft Montana’s state law on accessing experimental therapies. O’Neill knows Anzinger and said he talks to him “once or twice a year.”

O’Neill has also supported the idea of seasteading—building new “startup countries” at sea. He served on the board of directors of the Seasteading Institute until March 2024.

In 2009, O’Neill told an audience at a Seasteading Institute conference that “the healthiest societies in 2030 will most likely be on the sea.” When asked if he still thinks that’s the case, he said: “It’s not quite 2030, so I think it’s too soon to say … What I would say now is: the healthiest societies are likely to be the ones that encourage innovation the most.”

When it comes to his own personal ambitions for longevity, O’Neill said, he takes a simple approach that involves minimizing sugar and ultraprocessed food, exercising and sleeping well, and supplementing with vitamin D. He also said he tries to “eat a diet that has plenty of protein and saturated fat,” echoing the new dietary guidance issued by the US Departments of Health and Human Services and Agriculture. That guidance has been criticized by nutrition scientists, who point out that it ignores decades of research into the harms of a diet high in saturated fat.

We can expect to see more nutrition-related updates from HHS, said O’Neill: “We’re doing more research, more randomized controlled trials on nutrition. Nutrition is still not a scientifically solved problem.” Saturated fats are of particular interest, he said. He and his colleagues want to identify “the healthiest fats,” he said.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Not long ago, Peter Steinberger was experimenting with a side project that quickly caught fire across the developer world. His open-source AI assistant, OpenClaw, wasn’t just another chatbot; it could act on your behalf, from managing emails to integrating with calendars and messaging platforms.

Today, that project has a new chapter: Steinberger is joining OpenAI to help build the next generation of personal AI agents.

This move isn’t just about talent acquisition. It marks a switch in how the AI industry thinks about assistants: from reactive systems you talk to, toward agents that take initiative and perform tasks autonomously, with potential implications for productivity, workflows, and personal automation.

OpenClaw first emerged in late 2025 under names like Clawdbot and Moltbot. What distinguished it was not fancy visuals or marketing, but its practical ambition: give users an AI that connects to their tools and executes workflows, booking flights, sorting messages, scheduling meetings, in ways that feel closer to agency than assistant.

It quickly went viral on GitHub, drawing more than 100,000 stars and millions of visits to its project page within weeks.

Rather than turning OpenClaw into a standalone company, Steinberger chose to partner with OpenAI, a decision he explained in a blog post as driven by a simple goal: bring intelligent agents to a broader audience as quickly as possible.

According to him, OpenAI’s infrastructure, research resources, and product ecosystem offered the best path to scale such an ambitious idea.

OpenAI’s CEO Sam Altman welcomed Steinberger’s move as strategic, underscoring that the company expects personal agents, systems capable of initiating, coordinating, and completing tasks across apps, to be an important part of future AI products.

Altman’s public post noted that OpenClaw will continue to exist as an open-source project under a new foundation supported by OpenAI, preserving its accessibility and community roots.

The notion of AI that does things has been bubbling under the surface of tech discourse, but OpenClaw’s popularity crystallised it. Users interact with their agents through familiar interfaces like messaging platforms, but behind the scenes, these agents orchestrate API calls, automate scripts, handle notifications, and adapt to changing schedules, all without explicit commands after initial setup.

This trajectory, from an experimental open-source project to a central piece of a major AI lab’s strategy, speaks to broader trends in the industry. Competitors from Anthropic to Google DeepMind have also indicated interest in multi-agent systems and autonomous workflows, but OpenAI’s move signals how seriously the category is now being taken.

It suggests a future where AI isn’t just conversational, but proactive and tightly integrated into everyday tooling.

At the same time, this evolution raises fresh questions about governance and safety. OpenClaw’s open-source nature meant that developers could experiment freely, but that freedom also exposed potential attack surfaces; misconfigured agents with access to sensitive accounts or automation processes could be exploited if not properly safeguarded.

That is one reason why maintaining an open foundation with careful oversight matters as these tools scale.

For OpenAI, Steinberger’s arrival embeds this agent-first thinking into its product roadmap at a critical moment. The company is already exploring “multi-agent” architectures, where specialised AIs coordinate with each other and with users to handle complex tasks more effectively than monolithic models alone. Steinberger brings an experimental sensibility and real-world experience that could accelerate those efforts.

This could mean future versions of ChatGPT or other OpenAI products will be able to carry out tasks you define, rather than waiting for you to prompt them. That shift, from conversational replies to autonomous action, is the next frontier in how AI will fit into daily digital life.

And with OpenClaw’s creator now inside one of the most influential AI labs in the world, that future feels closer than ever.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The 62nd Munich Security Conference opened on 13 February 2026 in Munich, Germany, and this year’s gathering feels different from past editions.

For decades, Munich was about jets, troops, and treaties. Today, cyber and AI are no longer peripheral; they are part of the architecture of security itself.

Cyber risks, digital infrastructure, and emerging technologies like AI now sit alongside tanks and treaties on the agenda as European leaders try to make sense of a world where digital threats and geopolitical tensions are deeply intertwined.

Sponsors of the conference, such as the Tech Strategy Initiative, explicitly include technological frontier issues in the program, signalling that debates once confined to tech policy circles have broken into mainstream security discourse.

On day one, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz laid out a blunt message: the post-World War II order is fraying, and Europe can’t take its digital or geopolitical armour for granted.

In this context, cyber threats and disinformation campaigns sit side-by-side with missiles on the agenda, and delegates acted accordingly.

One of the most striking takeaways from early sessions was the call from Germany’s intelligence leadership for greater latitude to counter hybrid threats, especially cyber attacks and digital sabotage linked to geopolitical rivals.

That marks a clear recognition that state security no longer stops at the network perimeter.

Europe is still wrestling with its identity in this new era. France’s Emmanuel Macron used his keynote to stress that Europe must become a geopolitical power, an assertion that encompasses not just tanks and diplomacy but also domestic tech capabilities and digital resilience.

Behind the diplomatic language lies a subtler shift: technology is being woven into Europe’s strategic autonomy narrative.

For years, EU policy focused on digital sovereignty through regulation, the AI Act, data protection, and competition law. In Munich, those topics are now being discussed in direct relation to security and defence priorities. Officials and experts are framing AI and cyber resilience not just as economic or ethical issues, but as core national security concerns.

Cyber, in particular, has shed its niche status. While not all panels are formal conference sessions, side events and adjacent tracks like the Munich Cyber Security Conference reflect a broader realisation: traditional defence without a digital strategy is obsolete.

Defense analysts note that critical infrastructure, from power grids to military supply chains, is already being targeted with an intensity that demands coordinated public-private responses.

This shift has real consequences for European tech. If governments treat cyber and AI as strategic assets, they will push industry to meet security standards beyond compliance, incentivise homeland innovation over outsourcing, and push for interoperable defence technologies.

For European startups and tech leaders, that could change investment flows and R&D priorities in the next decade.

At Munich, the political undercurrents are as telling as the formal speeches. European leaders acknowledge that old alliances, especially with the United States, remain crucial but can’t be the sole guarantor of security.

That affects tech policy too. A pivot toward autonomy could mean tailoring AI standards to European norms, investing in sovereign semiconductor supply chains, and crafting digital infrastructure less dependent on external cloud and data platforms.

It also means Europe may push for security cooperation mechanisms akin to intelligence-sharing networks that historically excluded it. For example, European cyber chiefs are openly discussing options like an EU “own Five Eyes” model to coordinate multinational defence.

What the 2026 Munich Security Conference shows most clearly is how Europe is rethinking its place in a world where digital and geopolitical risks can no longer be separated.

Discussions here reinforce a shift in how policymakers, defence chiefs and industry leaders alike view modern threats: not as abstract data problems, but as strategic concerns that shape alliances, domestic policy choices and industrial priorities alike.

From calls for stronger cyber capabilities to renewed emphasis on strategic autonomy and technological resilience, this year’s gathering points to a future where technology is no longer an accessory to security policy but one of its pillars.

For Europe’s tech ecosystem, that means regulatory agendas, investment flows, and public-private cooperation will be shaped not just by innovation goals but by national and collective security imperatives.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">London-based deep tech startup Stanhope AI has closed a €6.7 million ($8 million) Seed funding round to advance what it calls a new class of adaptive artificial intelligence designed to power autonomous systems in the physical world.

The round was led by Frontline Ventures, with participation from Paladin Capital Group, Auxxo Female Catalyst Fund, UCL Technology Fund, and MMC Ventures.

The company says its approach moves beyond the pattern-matching strengths of large language models, aiming instead for systems that can perceive, reason, and act with a degree of context awareness in uncertain environments.

Stanhope is developing what it terms a “Real World Model”, building on principles from neuroscience and computational theory to allow machines to learn and adapt on the fly.

“We’re moving from language-based AI to intelligence that possesses the ability to act to understand its world – a system with a fundamental agency,” says Professor Rosalyn Moran, CEO and co-founder of Stanhope AI.

Her team includes theoretical neurobiologist Professor Karl Friston, whose work on the Free Energy Principle informs the startup’s methodology.

Rather than relying on cloud-centric deep learning, Stanhope’s models are designed to run efficiently on edge devices with limited data and power. That fits a broader industry shift toward on-device AI, where systems must operate reliably in dynamic settings such as autonomous vehicles, robots, and defence hardware.

The firm says its technology is already being tested on drones and other autonomous platforms with international partners.

Stanhope’s funding comes amid sustained investor interest in AI and autonomy startups across Europe. In recent months, companies from robotic manufacturing to defence software have attracted capital, underscoring demand for systems that go beyond conventional machine learning.

Frontline Ventures partner Zoe Chambers said Stanhope’s progress from academic research to production-ready systems was a rare combination in the industry, and that the technology had clear potential in domains where machines must react and adapt in real time.

Christopher Steed of Paladin Capital Group highlighted the relevance of adaptive AI for critical and security-sensitive applications.

Founded in 2023 as a spin-out from University College London and King’s College London, Stanhope AI aims to carve a niche at the intersection of robotics, industrial automation, and defense.

The new capital will help push its technology further into real-world deployments, where adaptability and resilience are often the key barriers to broader adoption.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Anthropic has just closed a $30 billion Series G funding round, pushing its valuation to $380 billion and catapulting it into the rarefied ranks of the most valuable private tech companies in the world.

The financing was led by Singapore’s sovereign wealth fund GIC and investment firm Coatue, with backing from a long list of global institutions, including D.E. Shaw Ventures, Dragoneer, Founders Fund, ICONIQ, and MGX, alongside strategic participation from existing tech investors.

That valuation is roughly double what Anthropic was worth at its last funding round in 2025, when it raised $13 billion at a $183 billion post-money figure.

Anthropic’s pitch for capital isn’t just about being “bigger” than its peers. According to the company’s own figures, it has grown from its first dollar of revenue to a running rate of about $14 billion in under three years, with revenue climbing more than tenfold annually across that span. That momentum matters to investors because it signals real commercial demand, not just theoretical potential.

A meaningful slice of that growth comes from enterprise customers who pay for Anthropic’s AI services and tools, including its Claude line of large language models and developer-focused products like Claude Code, which has seen particularly strong adoption.

Where Anthropic differs from many early-stage AI startups is that its product suite is not pitched solely at individual consumers. Instead, the focus is on business workflows and developer tools that can slot directly into existing enterprise systems.

That positioning appears to have broadened its customer base and diversified revenue streams in ways that pure chatbot plays haven’t yet matched.

A $380 billion valuation raises obvious comparisons with rivals, specifically OpenAI, which completed its own historic funding in 2025, but it also changes how the business will operate going forward.

With this capital, Anthropic plans to expand research, scale infrastructure, and accelerate development across emerging use cases in finance, cybersecurity, analytics, and beyond.

The size of the raise underlines how much money is still chasing artificial intelligence opportunities, even as parts of the wider tech sector cool off. For Anthropic, it also brings pressure: investors will expect the company to maintain rapid growth while steering clear of costly missteps in an increasingly competitive landscape.

This round matters not just for Anthropic’s balance sheet, but because it reflects how investors are thinking about the next phase of AI deployment. The emphasis has shifted from consumer-facing chatbots to enterprise-grade systems that automate real business tasks and workflows.

Anthropic’s success underscores that the market sees practical, high-revenue use cases as the next frontier and is willing to place massive bets on companies that can execute there.

If Anthropic continues on its current trajectory, it won’t just shape how AI tools are built. It will help define how they are purchased, integrated, and scaled across industries that have historically been slow to adopt new technology.

            <div id="article-text">If you opened a tech newsletter or even the internet in early 2026 and thought you’d stepped into a dystopian screenplay, or you are the main character in one of Isaac Asimov’s writings, you wouldn’t be alone.

Headlines trumpet layoffs, companies blame “AI transformation,” and somewhere in the background, billionaires cheer hot-off-the-press artificial intelligence strategies. Here’s the uncomfortable truth: people are still losing their jobs, while AI gets most of the credit.

According to the most recent tracking data, the pace of layoffs in tech remains high in 2026. Outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas reported that U.S. employers announced 108,435 job cuts in January 2026, the strongest January for layoffs since 2009, and more than double the total from the same month a year earlier

Let’s put some names to these numbers because real humans were behind them.

In late January 2026, Amazon confirmed 16,000 corporate job cuts, part of a wider reduction that has already seen tens of thousands of roles eliminated since late 2025. Revenue was high, investment in AI infrastructure was soaring, and yet people were still shown the door.

Salesforce, a company that frequently boasts about its AI products, quietly cut fewer than 1,000 jobs across teams, including marketing and product roles. These cuts even hit a division tied to their own AI products, which had been touted internally as strategic.

Layoff reports also include giants like Meta and Block, financial institutions, and even non-tech conglomerates retrenching under cost pressures.

Almost every layoff announcement seems to arrive with the same footnote: “This reflects our focus on AI and automation.” It’s catchy and convenient, and it shifts the conversation from “people lost their livelihoods” to “we are evolving.”

But there’s growing skepticism. Journalists and analysts have begun to use the term “AI-washing” to describe how companies attribute layoffs to artificial intelligence without clear evidence that AI systems replaced workers. They note that many organisations had no mature, scalable AI implementations capable of genuinely absorbing the tasks of entire teams before the cuts were announced.

This matters because real evidence of AI displacing large numbers of workers in the sense of robots doing jobs humans used to do is still limited. A recent firm-level study suggests that the use of AI tools can substitute some contracted labour over time, but the magnitude of this substitution remains modest and gradual rather than explosive.

So when a corporate press release asserts “AI is transforming our workforce,” match that upbeat line with the more prosaic reality: financial pressures, slower markets, and the legacy of pandemic hiring adjustments still account for a large share of job losses. Analysts have pointed out that many layoffs associated with AI could be driven as much by economic necessity or managerial optics as by genuine automation.

Tech layoffs aren’t an American story alone. In Europe, companies from telecommunications to manufacturing have either frozen hiring or cut jobs in response to slowing markets and external pressures.

The semiconductor maker ASML announced cuts of about 1,700 positions, while Ericsson is trimming around 1,600 roles in Sweden to adapt to a prolonged downturn in 5G spending. The consumer goods sector, banks, and industrial firms also announced job reductions in late 2025 and early 2026, reflecting a broader economic slowdown that goes far beyond a single technology trend.

In many of these cases, AI barely enters the conversation, but the human impact certainly does.

Putting it bluntly, 2026 isn’t yet the year robots suddenly outperformed entire industries and made humanity redundant. Historical layoffs like IBM’s roughly 60,000 job cuts in the 1990s or massive reductions during economic downturns like 2008  still rank among the largest single events in corporate labour history.

But what is different now is the narrative that accompanies it. Unlike blunt economic downturns, today’s layoffs are often framed as strategic transformations, a necessary step to embrace the shiny promise of artificial intelligence.

That frame protects executives and investors, but offers little consolation to the people whose positions are eliminated in the name of “efficiency.”

Let’s call it what it is. People are losing valuable jobs, and many of the reasons offered for those losses are wrapped in tech buzzwords. AI has the potential to change how work is done; no reasonable person denies that, but conflating investment in algorithms with wholesale human job replacement is an oversimplification that does a disservice to anyone trying to make sense of this moment.

If 2026 teaches us anything, it’s this: layoffs are real, painful, and often rooted in economic and strategic decisions that have little to do with machines spontaneously deciding they need fewer humans.

And the rush to blame AI as a convenient scapegoat obscures the deeper, harder questions we should be asking about how we value people, work, and community in a world that is increasingly enamoured with the idea of automation.

So yes, layoffs are sweeping across companies large and small. No, there isn’t clear evidence that AI has replaced humans en masse. And if we continue to let that narrative dominate, we risk forgetting that behind every data point is a human life, someone whose value isn’t measured in lines of code or the future earning potential of a machine.

Where we go from here depends on whether we treat people as assets to optimize away or as the very reason innovation should serve society in the first place.

            <div id="article-text">Have you ever asked Alexa to remind you to send a WhatsApp message at a determined hour? And then you just wonder, ‘Why can’t Alexa just send the message herself?

Or the incredible frustration when you use an app to plan a trip, only to have to jump to your calendar/booking website/tour/bank account instead of your AI assistant doing it all? Well, exactly this gap between AI automation and human action is what the agent-to-agent (A2A) protocol aims to address.

With the introduction of AI Agents, the next step of evolution seemed to be communication. But when communication between machines and humans is already here, what’s left?

Well, thinking about creating a multi-agent ecosystem to break the siloes between data systems and applications, Google announced the A2A protocol last year, in collaboration with more than 50 tech partners, an open standard protocol that allows AI agents to communicate, securely exchange information, collaborate, and operate between agentic applications and complex enterprise workflows, no matter their underlying technology.

A workspace designed for growth, collaboration, and endless networking opportunities in the heart of tech.

A2A is designed under five principles, which are natural capabilities. It enables the agents to collaborate in their natural modality without an intermediary tool, allowing agents to retain their individual capabilities and independence.

It is built on existing standards, making it easier to integrate with existing IT stacks, and paired with OpenAPI’s (Application Programming Interfaces) authentication schemes to guarantee secure collaboration. It provides real-life feedback as well as asynchronous notifications for long-running operations (LRO). Lastly, it was designed to support various modalities, including text, audio, and video streaming.

A2A works as a facilitator between a “client” agent and a “remote” agent. The client agent requests and communicates the tasks, while the remote agent is responsible for taking action on those tasks, looking for the best solution or input. This process involves several stages and key components:

This protocol complements Anthropic’s Model Context Protocol (MCP) for building robust agentic applications, since MCP provides agent-to-tool communication, allowing a better understanding and processing of abstract APIs to be used as tools, while the A2A protocol enables agents to discover each other’s capabilities, supporting the growth of agentic systems.

The A2A protocol was built to tackle the interoperability gap between specialized AI agents, with enterprise-scale adoption in mind. Instead of treating agents as isolated tools, like MCP works, A2A enables a shared ecosystem where agents can interact as agents, preserving their unique capabilities and higher-quality outcomes.

It also rethinks execution by allowing customizable, secure collaboration between opaque agents, preserving data privacy and intellectual property by design. As the number of agents and interactions grows, A2A addresses scalability head-on, enabling seamless integration and the emergence of complex AI ecosystems within enterprise systems, while relying on established standards, like HTTPS, and JSON-RPC to avoid reinventing core technologies, and existing web standards for authentication, authorization, security, privacy, tracing, and monitoring.

A2A has applications across a wide range of industries, including customer service, supply chain, human resources, healthcare, research, education, creative industries, public services, financial services, IT operations, and consulting.

By enabling agent collaboration across applications and organizations, it supports advanced data analysis and task automation, from background screenings and inventory logistics to enhanced fraud detection and highly personalized customer solutions.

Despite its promises, A2A is not without challenges. Like most distributed systems, one of the main concerns is security. Continuous back-and-forth communication within agents increases the threat to security across multiple layers, from identity and message, to context propagation and system management.

This problem highlights the need for an intrinsic identity, integrity, and sequencing guarantees for A2A, alongside the challenge of including this without compromising its lightweight design and interoperability.

A second limitation emerges at the architectural level, particularly in enterprise-scale AI communication. A2A relies primarily on HTTPS and high-performance Remote Procedure Call (RPC) in direct point-to-point communication.

While this works on a small scale, it can become a complex and unsustainable risk for large-scale enterprise environments. Single changes, overlaps, failures, or misrouted messages can cause cascade effects, enabling potential operational risk unless complemented with additional orchestration and governance mechanisms.

The incredibly fast introduction and adoption of AI agents, from AI agents to Agentic AI, has made it a necessity to be able to evolve alongside the technology. A2A marks a clear shift in how AI systems are thought and designed, creating an ecosystem to break the siloes and allowing cross-collaboration among agents.

It is, doubtlessly, necessary for modernity, and while it presents challenges and limitations, it is worth remembering that it is still in early stages and improvements will come while the protocol matures.

Alongside the MCP and LLMs, A2A enables a broader agent stack that suggests an emerging blueprint for agentic AI: where communication, execution, and governance are managed at distinct layers, enabling agents to act in real-world systems.

The real significance of A2A is what it signals about where AI is heading. The next generation of AI will not be defined by a single, all-purpose model, but by interconnected ecosystems of agents designed to work together by default.
