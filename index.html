            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Enforcement against polluters in the United States plunged in the first year of President Donald Trump’s second term, a far bigger drop than in the same period of his first term, according to a new report from a watchdog group.

By analyzing a range of federal court and administrative data, the nonprofit Environmental Integrity Project found that civil lawsuits filed by the US Department of Justice in cases referred by the Environmental Protection Agency dropped to just 16 in the first 12 months after Trump’s inauguration on Jan. 20, 2025. That is 76 percent less than in the first year of the Biden administration.

Trump’s first administration filed 86 such cases in its first year, which was in turn a drop from the Obama administration’s 127 four years earlier.

“Our nation’s landmark environmental laws are meaningless when EPA does not enforce the rules,” Jen Duggan, executive director of the Environmental Integrity Project, said in a statement.

The findings echo two recent analyses from the nonprofits Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility and Earthjustice, which both documented dwindling environmental enforcement under Trump.

From day one of Trump’s second term, the administration has pursued an aggressive deregulatory agenda, scaling back regulations and health safeguards across the federal government that protect water, air and other parts of the environment. This push to streamline industry activities has been particularly favorable for fossil fuel companies. Trump declared an “energy emergency” immediately after his inauguration.

At the EPA, Administrator Lee Zeldin launched in March what the administration called the “biggest deregulatory action in U.S. history”: 31 separate efforts to roll back restrictions on air and water pollution; to hand over more authority to states, some of which have a long history of supporting lax enforcement; and to relinquish EPA’s mandate to act on climate change under the Clean Air Act.

The new report suggests the agency is also relaxing enforcement of existing law. Neither the White House nor the EPA responded to a request for comment.

Part of the decline in lawsuits against polluters could be due to the lack of staff to carry them out, experts say. According to an analysis from E&E News, at least a third of lawyers in the Justice Department’s environment division have left in the past year. Meanwhile, the EPA in 2025 laid off hundreds of employees who monitored pollution that could hurt human health.

Top agency officials are also directing staff to issue fewer violation notices and reduce other enforcement actions. In December, the EPA formalized a new “compliance first” enforcement policy that stresses working with suspected violators to correct problems before launching any formal action that could lead to fines or mandatory correction measures.

“Formal enforcement … is appropriate only when compliance assurance or informal enforcement is inapplicable or insufficient to achieve rapid compliance,” wrote Craig Pritzlaff, who is now a principal deputy assistant EPA administrator, in a Dec. 5 memo to all enforcement officials and regional offices.

Only in rare cases involving an immediate hazard should enforcers use traditional case tools, Pritzlaff said. “Immediate formal enforcement may be required in certain circumstances, such as when there is an emergency that presents significant harm to human health and the environment,” he wrote.

Federal agencies like the EPA, with staffs far outmatched in size compared to the vast sectors of the economy they oversee, typically have used enforcement actions not only to deal with violators but to deter other companies from breaking the law. Environmental advocates worry that without environmental cops visible on the beat, compliance will erode.

Pritzlaff joined the EPA last fall after five years heading up enforcement for the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality, where nonprofit watchdog group Public Citizen noted that he was known as a “reluctant regulator.” Public Citizen and other advocacy groups criticized TCEQ under Pritzlaff’s leadership for its reticence to take decisive action against repeat violators.

One example: An INEOS chemical plant had racked up close to 100 violations over a decade before a 2023 explosion that sent one worker to the hospital, temporarily shut down the Houston Ship Channel and sparked a fire that burned for an hour. Public Citizen said it was told by TCEQ officials that the agency allowed violations to accumulate over the years, arguing it was more efficient to handle multiple issues in a single enforcement action.

“But that proved to be untrue, instead creating a complex backlog of cases that the agency is still struggling to resolve,” Public Citizen wrote last fall after Pritzlaff joined the EPA. “That’s not efficiency, it’s failure.”

Early last year, TCEQ fined INEOS $2.3 million for an extensive list of violations that occurred between 2016 and 2021.

The EPA doesn’t always take entities to court when they violate environmental laws. At times, the agency can resolve these issues through less-formal administrative cases, which actually increased during the first eight months of Trump’s second term when compared to the same period in the Biden administration, according to the new report.

However, most of these administrative actions involved violations of requirements for risk management plans under the Clean Air Act or municipalities’ violations of the Safe Drinking Water Act. The Trump administration did not increase administrative cases that involve pollution from industrial operations, Environmental Integrity Project spokesperson Tom Pelton said over email.

Another signal of declining enforcement: Through September of last year, the EPA issued $41 million in penalties—$8 million less than the same period in the first year of the Biden administration, after adjusting for inflation. This suggests “the Trump Administration may be letting more polluters get by with a slap on the wrist when the Administration does take enforcement action,” the report reads.

Combined, the lack of lawsuits, penalties, and other enforcement actions for environmental violations could impact communities across the country, said Erika Kranz, a senior staff attorney in the Environmental and Energy Law Program at Harvard Law School, who was not involved in the report.

“We’ve been seeing the administration deregulate by repealing rules and extending compliance deadlines, and this decline in enforcement action seems like yet another mechanism that the administration is using to de-emphasize environmental and public health protections,” Kranz said. “It all appears to be connected, and if you’re a person in the US who is worried about your health and the health of your neighbors generally, this certainly could have effects.”

The report notes that many court cases last longer than a year, so it will take time to get a clearer sense of how environmental enforcement is changing under the Trump administration. However, the early data compiled by the Environmental Integrity Project and other nonprofits shows a clear and steep shift away from legal actions against polluters.

Historically, administrations have a “lot of leeway on making enforcement decisions,” Kranz said. But this stark of a drop could prompt lawsuits against the Trump administration, she added.

“Given these big changes and trends, you might see groups arguing that this is more than just an exercise of discretion or choosing priorities [and] this is more of an abdication of an agency’s core mission and its statutory duties,” Kranz said. “I think it’s going to be interesting to see if groups make those arguments, and if they do, how courts look at them.”

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Amid a push toward AI agents, with both Anthropic and OpenAI shipping multi-agent tools this week, Anthropic is more than ready to show off some of its more daring AI coding experiments. But as usual with claims of AI-related achievement, you’ll find some key caveats ahead.

On Thursday, Anthropic researcher Nicholas Carlini published a blog post describing how he set 16 instances of the company’s Claude Opus 4.6 AI model loose on a shared codebase with minimal supervision, tasking them with building a C compiler from scratch.

Over two weeks and nearly 2,000 Claude Code sessions costing about $20,000 in API fees, the AI model agents reportedly produced a 100,000-line Rust-based compiler capable of building a bootable Linux 6.9 kernel on x86, ARM, and RISC-V architectures.

Carlini, a research scientist on Anthropic’s Safeguards team who previously spent seven years at Google Brain and DeepMind, used a new feature launched with Claude Opus 4.6 called “agent teams.” In practice, each Claude instance ran inside its own Docker container, cloning a shared Git repository, claiming tasks by writing lock files, then pushing completed code back upstream. No orchestration agent directed traffic. Each instance independently identified whatever problem seemed most obvious to work on next and started solving it. When merge conflicts arose, the AI model instances resolved them on their own.

The resulting compiler, which Anthropic has released on GitHub, can compile a range of major open source projects, including PostgreSQL, SQLite, Redis, FFmpeg, and QEMU. It achieved a 99 percent pass rate on the GCC torture test suite and, in what Carlini called “the developer’s ultimate litmus test,” compiled and ran Doom.

It’s worth noting that a C compiler is a near-ideal task for semi-autonomous AI model coding: The specification is decades old and well-defined, comprehensive test suites already exist, and there’s a known-good reference compiler to check against. Most real-world software projects have none of these advantages. The hard part of most development isn’t writing code that passes tests; it’s figuring out what the tests should be in the first place.

The compiler also has clear limitations that Carlini was upfront about. It lacks a 16-bit x86 backend needed to boot Linux from real mode, so it calls out to GCC for that step. Its own assembler and linker remain buggy. Even with all optimizations enabled, it produces less efficient code than GCC running with all optimizations disabled. And the Rust code quality, while functional, does not approach what an expert Rust programmer would produce. “The resulting compiler has nearly reached the limits of Opus’s abilities,” Carlini wrote. “I tried (hard!) to fix several of the above limitations but wasn’t fully successful. New features and bugfixes frequently broke existing functionality.”

Those limitations may actually be more informative than the successes. Carlini reports that toward the end of the project, fixing bugs and adding features “frequently broke existing functionality,” a pattern familiar to anyone who has watched a codebase grow beyond the point where any contributor fully understands it.

And that limitation is even more common when dealing with AI coding agents, which lose coherence over time. The model hit this wall at around 100,000 lines, which suggests a practical ceiling for autonomous agentic coding, at least with current models.

Anthropic describes the compiler as a “clean-room implementation” because the agents had no Internet access during development. But that framing is somewhat misleading. The underlying model was trained on enormous quantities of publicly available source code, almost certainly including GCC, Clang, and numerous smaller C compilers. In traditional software development, “clean room” specifically means the implementers have never seen the original code. By that standard, this isn’t one.

On Hacker News, the distinction drew sharp debate, reflective of a controversial reception to the news among developers. “It was rather a brute force attempt to decompress fuzzily stored knowledge contained within the network,” wrote one commenter.

The $20,000 figure also deserves some context. That number covers only API token costs and excludes the billions spent training the model, the human labor Carlini invested in building the scaffolding, and the decades of work by compiler engineers who created the test suites and reference implementations that made the project possible.

And that scaffolding was not trivial, which makes any claim of “autonomous” work on the C compiler among the AI agents dubious. While the headline result is a compiler written without human pair-programming, much of the real work that made the project function involved designing the environment around the AI model agents rather than writing compiler code directly. Carlini spent considerable effort building test harnesses, continuous integration pipelines, and feedback systems tuned for the specific ways language models fail.

He found, for example, that verbose test output polluted the model’s context window, causing it to lose track of what it was doing. To address this, Carlini designed test runners that printed only a few summary lines and logged details to separate files.

He also found that Claude has no sense of time and will spend hours running tests without making progress, so he built a fast mode that samples only 1 percent to 10 percent of test cases. When all 16 agents got stuck trying to fix the same Linux kernel bug simultaneously, he used GCC as a reference oracle, randomly compiling most kernel files with GCC and only a subset with Claude’s compiler, so each agent could work on different bugs in different files.

“Claude will work autonomously to solve whatever problem I give it,” Carlini wrote. “So it’s important that the task verifier is nearly perfect, otherwise Claude will solve the wrong problem.”

None of this should obscure what the project actually demonstrates. A year ago, no language model could have produced anything close to a functional multi-architecture compiler, even with this kind of babysitting and an unlimited budget. The methodology of parallel agents coordinating through Git with minimal human supervision is novel, and the engineering tricks Carlini developed to keep the agents productive (context-aware test output, time-boxing, the GCC oracle for parallelization) could potentially represent useful contributions to the wider use of agentic software development tools.

Carlini himself acknowledged feeling conflicted about his own results. “Building this compiler has been some of the most fun I’ve had recently, but I did not expect this to be anywhere near possible so early in 2026,” he wrote. He also raised concerns rooted in his previous career in penetration testing, noting that “the thought of programmers deploying software they’ve never personally verified is a real concern.”</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">As the 2026 Olympic Winter Games begin today, news articles are swelling with juicy claims that male ski jumpers have injected their penises with fillers to gain a flight advantage.

As the rumor goes, having a bigger bulge on a required 3D body scan taken in the pre-season could earn jumpers extra centimeters of material in their jumpsuits—and a suit’s larger nether regions provide more surface area to glide to the gold. Even a small increase can make a satisfying difference in this sport. A 2025 simulation-based study published in the journal Frontiers in Sports and Active Living suggested that every 2 cm of extra fabric in a ski jumpsuit could increase drag by about 4 percent and increase lift by about 5 percent. On a jump, that extra 2 cm of fabric amounts to an extra 5.8 meters, the simulations found.

Elite ski jumpers are aware of the advantage and have already crotch-rocketed to scandal with related schemes. Last year, two Norwegian Olympic medalists, Marius Lindvik and Johann Andre Forfang, and three of their team officials were charged with cheating after an anonymous video showed the head coach and suit technician illegally restitching the crotch area of the two jumpers’ suits to make them larger. The jumpers received a three-month suspension, while the head coach, an assistant coach, and the technician faced a harsher 18-month ban.

Injections are alleged to be a new, more drastic strategy. Rumors that jumpers were internally padding their peckers first came to light in January, when German newspaper Bild reported that there were “whispers” of jumpers using hyaluronic acid or possibly paraffin injections.

Bild quoted Dr. Kamran Karim, a specialist at Maria-Hilf Hospital in Krefeld, Germany, as saying (translated): “There is the possibility of obtaining a temporary, optical thickening of the penis with the injection of paraffin or hyaluronic acid. … Such an injection, however, is not medically indicated and involves risks.”

On Thursday, the injection claims sprang up again at a press conference in which journalists asked officials of the World Anti-Doping Agency about the claims. The agency’s director general said they were not aware of any claims and that non-doping means of enhancing performance are not in their purview. But according to the BBC, WADA President Witold Banka, who is from Poland, was “clearly entertained” by the questions, responding: “Ski jumping is very popular in Poland, so I promise you I’m going to look at it.”

Bruno Sassi, the communications director for FIS, the international ski and snowboard federation, seemed less amused, telling the BBC, “There has never been any indication, let alone evidence, that any competitor has ever made use of a hyaluronic acid injection to attempt to gain a competitive advantage.”

But what if they did? Here’s what we know about hyaluronic acid and paraffin for penis augmentation.

While some news outlets have played up the “acid” part of its name, hyaluronic acid is not some nefarious flesh-melting hazard. It’s a common filler used for various clinical purposes.

Hyaluronic acid is a polysaccharide that is naturally found in a wide variety of tissues in the human body, including the skin, eyes, and connective tissue. It’s a chief component of the extracellular matrix. It attracts water molecules to itself, creating volume that can provide structural support. In a pure form, it has no tissue or even species specificity and therefore is considered to have little risk of sparking immune responses.

As such, hyaluronic acid gel fillers are used in a variety of medical procedures, with approval from the Food and Drug Administration. Hyaluronic acid (HA) fillers are injected into joints, particularly knees, to relieve pain from mild to moderate arthritis, which can decrease the natural amount of HA in joints. Age also decreases natural levels of HA, and one of the main uses of HA fillers is for cosmetic purposes—plumping lips and cheeks, and minimizing the appearance of wrinkles and fine lines in the face. HA fillers can also be used inside the eye in a variety of surgeries, including cataract extraction and corneal transplants. It can also be used topically for wound care and to relieve skin pain and itching.

For these purposes, the most common adverse effects are pain, bruising, redness, itching, and swelling, which usually last for just a few days. In extremely rare cases, there can be more serious side effects from injections, such as bacterial infections, tissue death (from blocked blood flow), and a granulomatous foreign body reaction, in which the immune system tries to clear a foreign substance, such as bacterial impurities, leading to a collection of immune cells.

A notable feature of HA fillers is that they have something of an antidote. For procedures that go wrong for whatever reason, clinicians can use hyaluronidase, an enzyme that breaks down hyaluronic acid, to dissolve the filler. Hyaluronidase is then rapidly deactivated and degraded in the body. But even without any dissolving, HA fillers offer only temporary effects, lasting between eight weeks and up to six months, for the various established uses.

What is not on the list of established clinical purposes for HA fillers is penis augmentation. But that’s not from a lack of trying. Studies have looked at the possibility of using HA fillers for adding girth and length—and some of have reported positive results. But so far, there’s a lack of evidence to support safety and efficacy. Still, that hasn’t stopped cosmetic clinics around the world from offering it anyway.

In a 2022 study in the Asian Journal of Andrology, researchers in China followed 38 patients who had HA filler injections, which seemed to provide desired results. One month after injections, the men saw an average increase of 3.4 cm in girth and 2.5 cm in length when flaccid. After a year, the measurements had decreased, but were still an increase of 2.4 cm in girth and 1.65 cm in length. Erect girth ended at an average increase of 0.8 cm. The researchers reported that only three patients had complications: two had swelling, and one had bleeding under the skin. All three cases resolved on their own.

However, not all reports are so rosy. In a 2021 case study in BMC Urology, researchers in Australia reported the experience of a 31-year-old man who received penis HA fillers at a cosmetic clinic. He developed a severe penis infection soon after that led to sepsis and multi-organ failure, landing him in the intensive care unit. Doctors ended up surgically removing pus-stained filler from his penis, which laboratory tests found teeming with Streptococcus pyogenes.

Another case study in 2021, published in a Japanese urology journal, reported that a 65-year-old man had to have part of his penis surgically removed after having HA fillers injected into the head of his penis. When he arrived at the hospital, black necrotic lesions and ulcers were readily visible.

While things can go wrong with HA fillers, despite their legitimate clinical uses, the outcomes for paraffin injections are much darker. Amid the Olympics scandal, most of the focus has been on hyaluronic acid. But the initial Bild article introduced speculation that skiers could also use paraffin injections to jack up their junk, which would be a terrible idea.

The use of injections of mineral oil or paraffin wax for cosmetic procedures dates back to at least 1899, when it was almost immediately found to have horrifying results. The injections lead to what’s called paraffinoma, in which the body tries to encapsulate and sequester the oil it can’t degrade. The result is tissue that looks like swiss cheese—with large spaces filled with oil. Over time, the tissue becomes thickened and scarred and can block lymphatic drainage. From the outside, it results in disfiguring and debilitating lesions. Some people initially ignored these disturbing results because, in some cases, the lesions can take years to develop.

While such injections have largely been abandoned, cases occasionally crop up. That includes a 2002 report of a 64-year-old Michigan man who self-injected his penis with mineral oil to increase its girth. He used a series of shots over the course of 18 months. Two years after the last shot, he went to urologists because of an increasing mass in his penis that was causing erectile dysfunction and making it difficult to urinate. He reluctantly admitted to the oil injections only after his doctors suspected cancer. In the end, the doctors had to surgically remove the mass of oily nodules from all around his penis and circumcise him.

Whatever is going on in the trousers of Olympic ski jumpers, let’s hope it doesn’t involve paraffin.</div>

            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-02-06</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2026/02/randomly-quoting-ray-bradbury-did-not-save-lawyer-from-losing-case-over-ai-errors/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Frustrated by fake citations and flowery prose packed with “out-of-left-field” references to ancient libraries and Ray Bradbury’s Fahrenheit 451, a New York federal judge took the rare step of terminating a case this week due to a lawyer’s repeated misuse of AI when drafting filings.

In an order on Thursday, district judge Katherine Polk Failla ruled that the extraordinary sanctions were warranted after an attorney, Steven Feldman, kept responding to requests to correct his filings with documents containing fake citations.

One of those filings was “noteworthy,” Failla said, “for its conspicuously florid prose.” Where some of Feldman’s filings contained grammatical errors and run-on sentences, this filing seemed glaringly different stylistically.

It featured, the judge noted, “an extended quote from Ray Bradbury’s Fahrenheit 451 and metaphors comparing legal advocacy to gardening and the leaving of indelible ‘mark[s] upon the clay.’” The Bradbury quote is below:

“Everyone must leave something behind when he dies, my grandfather said. A child or a book or a painting or a house or a wall built or a pair of shoes made. Or a garden planted. Something your hand touched some way so your soul has somewhere to go when you die, and when people look at that tree or that flower you planted, you’re there. It doesn’t matter what you do, he said, so long as you change something from the way it was before you touched it into something that’s like you after you take your hands away. The difference between the man who just cuts lawns and a real gardener is in the touching, he said. The lawn-cutter might just as well not have been there at all; the gardener will be there a lifetime.”

Another passage Failla highlighted as “raising the Court’s eyebrows” curiously invoked a Bible passage about divine judgment as a means of acknowledging the lawyer’s breach of duty in not catching the fake citations:

“Your Honor, in the ancient libraries of Ashurbanipal, scribes carried their stylus as both tool and sacred trust—understanding that every mark upon clay would endure long beyond their mortal span. As the role the mark (x) in Ezekiel Chapter 9, that marked the foreheads with a tav (x) of blood and ink, bear the same solemn recognition: that the written word carries power to preserve or condemn, to build or destroy, and leaves an indelible mark which cannot be erased but should be withdrawn, let it lead other to think these citations were correct.

I have failed in that sacred trust. The errors in my memorandum, however inadvertent, have diminished the integrity of the record and the dignity of these proceedings. Like the scribes of antiquity who bore their stylus as both privilege and burden, I understand that legal authorship demands more than mere competence—it requires absolute fidelity to truth and precision in every mark upon the page.”

Although the judge believed the “florid prose” signaled that a chatbot wrote the draft, Feldman denied that. In a hearing transcript in which the judge weighed possible sanctions, Feldman testified that he wrote every word of the filings. He explained that he read the Bradbury book “many years ago” and wanted to include “personal things” in that filing. And as for his references to Ashurbanipal, that also “came from me,” he said.

Instead of admitting he had let an AI draft his filings, he maintained that his biggest mistake was relying on various AI programs to review and cross-check citations. Among the tools that he admitted using included Paxton AI, vLex’s Vincent AI, and Google’s NotebookLM. Essentially, he testified that he substituted three rounds of AI review for one stretch reading through all the cases he was citing. That misstep allowed hallucinations and fake citations to creep into the filings, he said.

But the judge pushed back, writing in her order that it was “extremely difficult to believe” that AI did not draft those sections containing overwrought prose. She accused Feldman of dodging the truth.

“The Court sees things differently: AI generated this citation from the start, and Mr. Feldman’s decision to remove most citations and write ‘more of a personal letter&#39;” is “nothing but an ex post justification that seeks to obscure his misuse of AI and his steadfast refusal to review his submissions for accuracy,” Failla wrote.

At the hearing, she expressed frustration and annoyance at Feldman for evading her questions and providing inconsistent responses. Eventually, he testified that he used AI to correct information when drafting one of the filings, which Failla immediately deemed “unwise,” but not the one quoting Bradbury.

Feldman is one of hundreds of lawyers who have relied on AI to draft filings, which have introduced fake citations into cases. Lawyers have offered a wide range of excuses for relying too much on AI. Some have faced small fines, around $150, while others have been slapped with thousands in fines, including one case where sanctions reached $85,000 for repeated, abusive misconduct. At least one law firm has threatened to fire lawyers citing fake cases, and other lawyers have imposed other voluntary sanctions, like taking a yearlong leave of absence.

Seemingly, Feldman did not think sanctions were warranted in this case. In his defense of three filings containing 14 errors out of 60 total citations, Feldman discussed his challenges accessing legal databases due to high subscription costs and short library hours. With more than one case on his plate and his kids’ graduations to attend, he struggled to verify citations during times when he couldn’t make it to the library, he testified. As a workaround, he relied on several AI programs to verify citations that he found by searching on tools like Google Scholar.

Feldman likely did not expect the judge to terminate the case as a result of his AI misuses. Asked how he thought the court should resolve things, Feldman suggested that he could correct the filings by relying on other attorneys to review citations, while avoiding “any use whatsoever of any, you know, artificial intelligence or LLM type of methods.” The judge, however, wrote that his repeated misuses were “proof” that he “learned nothing” and had not implemented voluntary safeguards to catch the errors.

Asked for comment, Feldman told Ars that he did not have time to discuss the sanctions but that he hopes his experience helps raise awareness of how inaccessible court documents are to the public. “Use of AI, and the ability to improve it, exposes a deeper proxy fight over whether law and serious scholarship remain publicly auditable, or drift into closed, intermediary‑controlled systems that undermine verification and due process,” Feldman suggested.

“The real lesson is about transparency and system design, not simply tool failure,” Feldman said.

But at the hearing, Failla said that she thinks Feldman had “access to the walled garden” of legal databases, if only he “would go to the law library” to do his research, rather than rely on AI tools.

“It sounds like you want me to say that you should be absolved of all of these terrible citation errors, these missed citations, because you don’t have Westlaw,” the judge said. “But now I know you have access to Westlaw. So what do you want?”

As Failla explained in her order, she thinks the key takeaway is that Feldman routinely failed to catch his own errors. She said that she has no problem with lawyers using AI to assist their research, but Feldman admitted to not reading the cases that he cited and “apparently” cannot “learn from his mistakes.”

Verifying case citations should never be a job left to AI, Failla said, describing Feldman’s research methods as “redolent of Rube Goldberg.”

“Most lawyers simply call this ‘conducting legal research,’” Failla wrote. “All lawyers must know how to do it. Mr. Feldman is not excused from this professional obligation by dint of using emerging technology.”

His “explanations were thick on words but thin on substance,” the judge wrote. She concluded that he “repeatedly and brazenly” violated Rule 11, which requires attorneys to verify the cases that they cite, “despite multiple warnings.”

Noting that Feldman “failed to fully accept responsibility,” she ruled that case-terminating sanctions were necessary, entering default judgment for the plaintiffs. Feldman may also be on the hook to pay fees for wasting other attorneys’ time.

The hearing transcript has circulated on social media due to the judge’s no-nonsense approach to grilling Feldman, whom she clearly found evasive and lacking credibility.

“Look, if you don’t want to be straight with me, if you don’t want to answer questions with candor, that’s fine,” Failla said. “I’ll just make my own decisions about what I think you did in this case. I’m giving you an opportunity to try and explain something that I think cannot be explained.”

In her order this week, she noted that Feldman “struggled to make eye contact” and left the court without “clear answers.”

Feldman’s errors came in a case in which a toy company sued merchants who allegedly failed to stop selling stolen goods after receiving a cease-and-desist order. His client was among the merchants accused of illegally profiting from the alleged thefts. They faced federal charges of trademark infringement, unfair competition, and false advertising, as well as New York charges, including fostering the sale of stolen goods.

The loss triggers remedies, including an injunction preventing additional sales of stolen goods and refunding every customer who bought them. Feldman’s client must also turn over any stolen goods in their remaining inventory and disgorge profits. Other damages may be owed, along with interest. Ars could not immediately reach an attorney for the plaintiffs to discuss the sanctions order or resulting remedies.

Failla emphasized in her order that Feldman appeared to not appreciate “the gravity of the situation,” repeatedly submitting filings with fake citations even after he had been warned that sanctions could be ordered.

That was a choice, Failla said, noting that Feldman’s mistakes were caught early by a lawyer working for another defendant in the case, Joel MacMull, who urged Feldman to promptly notify the court. The whole debacle would have ended in June 2025, MacMull suggested at the hearing.

Rather than take MacMull’s advice, however, Feldman delayed notifying the court, irking the judge. He testified during the heated sanctions hearing that the delay was due to an effort he quietly undertook, working to correct the filing. He supposedly planned to submit those corrections when he alerted the court to the errors.

But Failla noted that he never submitted corrections, insisting instead that Feldman kept her “in the dark.”

“There’s no real reason why you should have kept this from me,” the judge said.

The court learned of the fake citations only after MacMull notified the judge by sharing emails of his attempts to get Feldman to act urgently. Those emails showed Feldman scolding MacMull for unprofessional conduct after MacMull refused to check Feldman’s citations for him, which Failla noted at the hearing was absolutely not MacMull’s responsibility.

Feldman told Failla that he also thought it was unprofessional for MacMull to share their correspondence, but Failla said the emails were “illuminative.”

At the hearing, MacMull asked if the court would allow him to seek payment of his fees, since he believes “there has been a multiplication of proceedings here that would have been entirely unnecessary if Mr. Feldman had done what I asked him to do that Sunday night in June.”</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Open source packages published on the npm and PyPI repositories were laced with code that stole wallet credentials from dYdX developers and backend systems and, in some cases, backdoored devices, researchers said.

“Every application using the compromised npm versions is at risk ….” the researchers, from security firm Socket, said Friday. “Direct impact includes complete wallet compromise and irreversible cryptocurrency theft. The attack scope includes all applications depending on the compromised versions and both developers testing with real credentials and production end-users.”

dYdX is a decentralized derivatives exchange that supports hundreds of markets for “perpetual trading,” or the use of cryptocurrency to bet that the value of a derivative future will rise or fall. Socket said dYdX has processed over $1.5 trillion in trading volume over its lifetime, with an average trading volume of $200 million to $540 million and roughly $175 million in open interest. The exchange provides code libraries that allow third-party apps for trading bots, automated strategies, or backend services, all of which handle mnemonics or private keys for signing.

The npm malware embedded a malicious function in the legitimate package. When a seed phrase that underpins wallet security was processed, the function exfiltrated it, along with a fingerprint of the device running the app. The fingerprint allowed the threat actor to correlate stolen credentials to track victims across multiple compromises. The domain receiving the seed was dydx[.]priceoracle[.]site, which mimics the legitimate dYdX service at dydx[.]xyz through typosquatting.

The malicious code available on PyPI contained the same credential theft function, although it also implemented a remote access Trojan (RAT) that allowed the execution of new malware on infected systems. The backdoor received commands from dydx[.]priceoracle[.]site. The domain was registered on January 9, 17 days before the malicious package was uploaded to PyPI.

Socket said the packages were published to npm and PyPI by official dYdX accounts, an indication that they were compromised and used by the attackers. dYdX officials didn’t respond to an email seeking confirmation and additional details.

The incident is at least the third time dYdX has been targeted in attacks. Previous events include a September 2022 uploading of malicious code to the npm repository and the commandeering in 2024 of the dYdX v3 website through DNS hijacking. Users were redirected to a malicious site that prompted them to sign transactions designed to drain their wallets.

“Viewed alongside the 2022 npm supply chain compromise and the 2024 DNS hijacking incident, this [latest] attack highlights a persistent pattern of adversaries targeting dYdX-related assets through trusted distribution channels,” Socket said. “The threat actor simultaneously compromised packages in both npm and PyPI ecosystems, expanding the attack surface to reach JavaScript and Python developers working with dYdX.”

Anyone using the platform should carefully examine all apps for dependencies on the malicious packages listed above.</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">After writing two November stories analyzing price expectations for Valve’s upcoming Steam Machine, I really didn’t think we’d be offering more informed speculation before the official price was revealed. Then Valve wrote a blog post this week noting that the “growing price of… critical components” like RAM and storage meant that “we must revisit our exact shipping schedule and pricing” for the living room-focused PC gaming box.

We don’t know exactly what form that “revisiting” will take at the moment. Analysts who spoke to Ars were somewhat divided on how much of its quickly increasing component costs Valve would be willing (or forced) to pass on to consumers.

“We knew the component issue was bad,” DFC Intelligence analyst David Cole told Ars. “It has just gotten worse. “

How much worse has the pricing situation gotten for Valve since November? Superdata Research founder and SuperJoost newsletter author Joost van Dreunen suggested that the 512GB Steam Machine model would probably run $50 to $75 more than he expected when the Steam Machine was announced, and to expect a price “potentially $100+ above target” for the high-end 2TB model. That would mean a $599 to $629 price at the low-end and $849 to $899 for the high-end model, in his estimation.

Wedbush Morgan analyst Michael Pachter agreed that, even with the additional component costs, Valve would likely “try to get it out at $599 or so for the 512GB version,” A starting price higher than that would mean “abysmal” sales, he added. “I think $700 is a death sentence and $1,000 is unsellable.”

Other analysts think that Pachter’s “unsellable” price for the Steam Machine is increasingly plausible now, though. DFC’s Cole said possible prices for the Steam Machine are now “approaching $1,000,” with the 512GB model perhaps $100 less than 2TB model. But F-Squared analyst Michael Futter expected an even bigger gap between the two models, saying the 512GB model “could crest $1,000” and the 2TB model would likely fall somewhere in the $1,300 to $1,500 range.

On the surface, it might seem like every company making gaming hardware would be similarly affected by increasing component costs. In practice, though, analysts suggested that Valve might be in a uniquely bad position to absorb this ongoing market disruption.

Large console makers like Sony and Microsoft “can commit to tens of millions of orders, and have strong negotiating power,” Niko Partners analyst Daniel Ahmad pointed out. The Steam Machine, on the other hand, is “a niche product that cannot benefit in the same way when it comes to procurement,” meaning Valve has to shoulder higher component cost increases.

F-Squared’s Futter echoed that Valve is “not an enormous player in the hardware space, even with the Steam Deck’s success. So they likely don’t have the same kind of priority as a Nintendo, Sony, or Microsoft when it comes to suppliers.”

The size of the Steam Machine price adjustment also might depend on when Valve made its supply chain commitments. “It’s not clear when or if Valve locked in supply contracts for the Steam Machine, or if supply can be diverted from the Steam Deck for the new product,” Tech Insights analyst James Sanders noted. On the other hand, “Sony and Microsoft likely will have locked in more favorable component pricing before the current spike,” Van Dreunen said.

That said, some other aspects of the Steam Machine design could give Valve some greater pricing flexibility. Sanders noted that the Steam Machine’s smaller physical size could mean smaller packaging and reduced shipping costs for Valve. And selling the system primarily through direct sales via the web and Steam itself eliminates the usual retailer markups console makers have to take into account, he added.

“I think Valve was hoping for a much lower price and that the component issue would be short-term,” Cole said. “Obviously it is looking more like a long-term issue.”

So, if Valve is forced to significantly increase the asking price of the Steam Machine, does that mean significantly fewer people will be willing to buy it? Not necessarily. DFC’s Cole said that this kind of gaming hardware already has “a fairly niche built-in audience that will not be too price sensitive.”

Van Dreunen agreed that the Steam Machines’ “core audience, PC gamers who want a living room setup without the hassle of a full build, will absorb a $50 to $100 price increase without much hesitation.” But that core audience might not be very large; Pachter said that, even with a $599 starting price, the Steam Machine would “likely sell no more than 5 million [units].” At a higher starting price, he saw total sales going down quickly.

The analysts who spoke to Ars agreed that recent price increases for every major game console gave Valve a little more competitive breathing room regarding pricing. But the relative price difference between Valve and the other console makers will still matter, they said.

“While Valve may have been aiming to price its Steam Machine in line with the PS5/Xbox Series X|S at one point, or potentially undercut it, it’s now clear that the company may have to price it above these competitors,” Ahmad said. “At a time when multiple competitors exist on the market, we believe the higher price will limit the audience for the Steam Machine going forward.”

Futter agreed that whichever company could offer the lowest-cost machine that could plausibly offer 4K, 60 fps performance in most modern games (as the Steam Machine is targeting) would reap great benefits in the market. But even if the Steam Machine isn’t cheaper than competing high-end consoles, Futter said Valve’s hardware would appeal to those who “want to get into [high-end] PC gaming and can’t absorb $2,500+ for access to the Steam ecosystem.”

In the end, how Valve handles Steam Machine pricing might depend on whether the company wants to “expand SteamOS beyond the enthusiast base and into territory currently held by PlayStation and Xbox,” as Van Dreunen put it. “The memory cost shock doesn’t threaten Valve’s ability to sell to its existing audience. It threatens the pace at which it can grow a new one.”</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Since the first nuclear power plant went online in the US in December of 1957, administrators have been scrambling for a solution to the inevitable and decidedly nasty waste that comes out at the end of the process. Almost seven decades have gone by, but an elegant solution has remained elusive — due to the inconvenient fact that the waste is horrendously toxic, a potential target for terrorists, and needs to be stored securely for thousands of years.

New reporting by Reuters reveals the Trump administration’s latest attempt to solve the nuclear waste dilemma. A fresh directive by the Department of Energy is asking individual US states to volunteer to host a new “permanent geological repository” for spent fuel rods.

States wouldn’t be taking on the burden without any reward. The upside would be potential economic growth in the form of vast investments and “thousands of jobs,” in an era when layoffs and austerity are taking a heavy toll.

For interested states, the nuclear waste storage would come as part of a Nuclear Lifecycle Innovation Campus, production sites planned around new reactor buildouts and uranium enrichment facilities. In other words, while having to store the country’s nuclear waste forever might be a drag, it could come with a boost to energy production, jobs, and exports.

“By combining this all together in a package, it’s a matter of big carrots being placed alongside a waste facility which is less desirable,” Lake Barrett, a former official from the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission told Reuters.

Per Barrett, states including Utah and Tennessee already expressed an interest. Any other state which hopes to hop on has 60 days to answer the call.

It comes as Trump hopes to quadruple US nuclear power capacity by 2050, primarily by boosting small, low-footprint nuclear reactors known as small modular reactors. Though countries like China and Russia have experimented with SMRs with success, the technology remains untested in the US.

Trump has also pushed for the development of “microreactors,” which are nuclear reactors small enough to be transported on the back of a truck. Microreactors remain a military interest for the most part, with the US Army planning to bring at least one online by summer of 2026.

As for the waste, it remains to be seen whether the administration can overcome decades of opposition to finally find the country’s nuclear waste a home. Time will tell.

            <div id="article-text">Elon Musk’s X — formerly known as Twitter and newly acquired by SpaceX — says it will give a million bucks to a proudly self-proclaimed Nazi.

On Tuesday, the social media site and Grok-run asylum announced the winners of its “$1M Article Contest,” with the grand prize going to a user named Beaver with the handle @beaverd. As many quickly noticed, that user happens to be an out-and-out white supremacist with over 100,000 followers, who Musk has interacted with in the past.

Don’t just take our word for it. In one tweet, Beaver — who describes himself as “God’s most r*tarded soldier” — expressed his regret that Trump wasn’t even more right wing, writing that he wished the US president “was literally Hitler.”

One of his favorite groups to rail against are Somalis — the right’s bugbear du jour — accusing them of having lower IQ than wild animals. He also runs a website that supposedly tracks government spending and fraud called “SomaliScan,” which has its own meme coin with the ticker $SS.

And like any good right-wing edgelord, Beaver also has no qualms about how his views — like thinking civil rights were a mistake — are perceived.

“I dont care what you call loving America,” Beaver fumed just a week before winning the prize. “If thats what a nazi does, then I am a nazi.”

Never mind that these are the kinds of views that now thrive on X — it’s alarming to see them directly rewarded by the platform to the tune of a million dollars. It also must make for a surreal moment for SpaceX fans who simply wanted to appreciate cool rockets without becoming embroiled in Musk’s increasingly deranged political forays, something that was already difficult to separate but is now even more inextricable following SpaceX’s questionable acquisition of xAI, which operates X.

Still, it shouldn’t be a surprise. Musk regularly shares his own racist thoughts and conspiracy theories and boosts the posts of right wing accounts that he agrees with. Beaver is one account that’s received the owner’s blessing: last month, Musk showed his appreciation of data Beaver shared from his SomaliScan website, replying with his trademark, “Wow.”

The contest criteria, by the way, is pretty dubious. The winner is based primarily on “Verified Home Timeline impressions,” according to X, meaning it’s essentially rewarding people for engagement farming. And right wing content sells very well indeed on Musk’s X. If the actual quality of the work were the primary factor, we might have a different winner: Beaver’s article starts with the astonishing claim that “you were never meant to hear the name ‘Deloitte&#39;” — despite the Deloitte in question being one of the largest and most well-known accounting firms in the world.

In a move typical for far-right influencers, Beaver immediately capitalized on his winnings by trying to coax his followers into signing up for a crypto casino. “I’m giving $25k of my million back to players who play under my [referral link],” he promised.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Chinese automotive company XPeng made a big splash last year with its Terminator-like humanoid robot, dubbed Iron. The bipedal robot — which features certain eyebrow-raising design choices — was seen sauntering across the stage with an impressively lifelike “catwalk” gait.

But the company may have flown a little too close to the Sun. During a similar tech demo at a mall in Shenzhen, China, over the weekend, the robot once again ambled across a marbled floor in front of an eager crowd — only to suddenly start twisting its back in an unnatural way before falling over and faceplanting with an audible thud.

Footage circulating online shows someone break Iron’s fall. It eventually took three individuals to drag the 154-pound, five-foot-eight humanoid robot away from the prying eyes of the curious crowd. Some audience members can be heard chuckling to themselves as the robot is carried away.

Many netizens joked that it was the ultimate proof that Xpeng’s robot is not, in fact, a human in a costume, as some suspected when its human-like gait was first revealed.

The damage appears to have been done. As the South China Morning Post reports, footage of Xpeng’s fumble circulated widely on Chinese social media networks, eventually forcing cofounder and CEO He Xiaopeng to address the situation on Weibo.

“It reminds me of how all toddlers learn to walk,” he wrote in the post, as quoted by the SCMP. “After a fall, they will stand firm; the next step is to begin running, and to keep running.”

The company was clearly rattled by all of the negative press coverage. During the next day of Xpeng’s marketing campaign, the robot was strapped to a frame, per the newspaper.

Xpeng is far from alone in struggling to keep its bipedal robots on two feet. We’ve seen plenty of other humanoid robots by manufacturers stumble as well. Case in point, one recent viral video appears to show a human teleoperator taking off their headset, causing the Tesla Optimus robot they were controlling to reel back and collapse.

In November, a video circulating online showed a Russian humanoid robot, dubbed AIdol, fall while trying to walk across a stage.

Other companies have made major strides in keeping their robots upright. Researchers have managed to teach Chinese manufacturer Unitree’s popular G1 robot to be extremely resilient, allowing it to survive a lot of abuse, from a direct dropkick to being jerked around by a chain around its neck.

Most recently, Unitree had one of its G1 robots map out the Winter Olympics logo by trekking 130,000 steps across a snowy, frozen landscape in Altay prefecture in northern China, as temperatures sank to -52 degrees Fahrenheit.

Xpeng is hoping to kick off “large-scale mass production” of its Iron robot before the end of the year — stability be damned, apparently.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Are ski jumpers enhancing their genitalia to fly further? That’s the big question looming over this year’s Winter Olympics in Milan and Cortina d’Ampezzo, Italy.

The speculation stems from a report by the German newspaper Bild which alleged that some of the high-flying athletes maybe injecting their members with hyaluronic acid to gain an aerodynamic advantage. The injection enlarges the penis and increases the suit’s surface area, in theory granting a jumper greater lift — and thereby endowing the term “crotch rocket” with a whole new meaning.

The allegations were apparently deemed serious enough to be addressed by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA), with its president — and Poland’s former minister of sport and tourism — Witold Bańka vowing to get to the bottom of the situation.

“Ski jumping is very popular in Poland, so I promise you I’m going to look at it,” he said with a smirk, as quoted by The Guardian.

As most coverage has noted, this isn’t even the sport’s first crotch-related scandal. Last year, Norway’s skiing team was caught manipulating their suits to get an edge by adding a banned form of stitching into the groin region to increase the suit’s surface area.

Stiff penalties were brought on two of the team’s coaches. Meanwhile, Marius Lindvik and Johann Andre Forfang, two recent Olympic medalists on the team, were given a — dare we say — flaccid punishment of a three-month ban, after claiming they were unaware of the below-the-belt scheme.

It’s one thing to adjust the fabric around your crotch, and another to actually turn to dick injections. And would it even work? According to doctor Kamran Karim, who was quoted by Bild: “It is possible to achieve a temporary, visual thickening of the penis by injecting paraffin or hyaluronic acid. Such an injection is not medically indicated and is associated with risks.”

As for the advantage this would give, a study published in the journal Fronters in October found that every two centimeter increase (roughly three quarters of an inch) in suit circumference increased lift by four percent, equaling an extra two feet in a ski jump.

It’s not hard proof, and it’s hard to say if it would be worth it to pull off, but there does appear to be some science suggesting that this could work in the real world. Still, no individual athlete has aroused the suspicion of investigators — yet.

“I’m not aware of the details of ski jumping and how it can improve but if anything was to come to the surface we would look at anything if it is actually doping related,” said Oliver Niggli, director general of WADA, at the conference.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Last year, 21 humanoid robots squared up against each other in the World Humanoid Robot Games’ half marathon race in Beijing in an unintentionally hilarious debauchery of broken limbs, face plants — plus sweaty human engineers, who were forced to accompany them along the way.

Coming in third place was a bipedal robot called Walker 2, by the Shanghai-based robotics company DroidUP, an impressive feat that required no battery swaps after an exhausting four hours and 25 minutes of running.

Now, the firm has turned its attention to something far more unsettling than watching a robot scuttle across the finish line. DroidUP recently showed off Moya, a “warm” robot that features human-like skin and eerily animated moving facial features.

“Warm” isn’t just a turn of phrase, either — Moya’s skin can maintain a humanlike temperature of 89 to 96 degrees Fahrenheit, a feature that could make it more difficult for DroidUP to argue that the bot isn’t intended for adult purposes.

The company showed off its latest invention at a ribbon-cutting ceremony in Shanghai’s Zhangjiang Robotics Valley, calling it the “world’s first highly bionic robot that deeply integrates human aesthetics and advanced humanoid sports” in a translated press release.

The bot’s face is disarming. The company says it allows for “rich expressions such as joy, anger, sorrow and happiness”; in a video shared by the Chinese goverment-run Shanghai Media Group (SMB), Moya can even be seen catching the reporter’s line of sight by adjusting the direction of its pupils.

But unlike many of its hyper-realistic counterparts, Moya can go for a walk as well. In a demonstration, Moya stiffly walks past the camera as its actuators audibly click along, firmly dispelling the illusion. The company claims Moya has a 92 percent human-like walking accuracy, but given the evidence, we’d wager the real number is less flattering than that.

“Most robots on the market today have hard shells and feel cold and mechanical,” DroidUP founder Li Qingdu told SMB in the video. “A robot that truly serves human life should be warm, have a temperature, almost like a living being that people can connect with.”

Underneath it all is the company’s latest Walker 3 robot platform, which features a suite of cameras and LIDAR sensors that allow for “autonomous path planning and real-time obstacle avoidance capabilities,” according to the press release.

Compared to its Walker 2 predecessor, who finished third during its half marathon attempt last year, Walker 3 is a lot more compact and lighter, allowing it to be “integrated into a very realistic torso, enabling the creation of a more aesthetically lifelike humanoid robot,” as DroidUP product director Tang Jun told SMB.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Venus has long been known as Earth’s evil twin. While they both are roughly the same size and formed in the same inner region of the solar system, Venus is far less hospitable to life as we know it. Its surface temperatures can reach over 900 degrees Fahrenheit. Its clouds are made of sulfuric acid, and its surface atmospheric pressure is almost 100 times that of Earth, the equivalent of being 3,000 underwater.

And beneath all those extreme conditions, the planet could harbor cavernous structures called lava tubes, as an international team of researchers suggests in a new paper accepted for publication in the journal Icarus.

On Earth, lava tubes are the byproduct of volcanic activity that is left behind as liquid lava retreats, and are believed to exist on the Moon and Mars as well.

While they may not serve as a great place to build a shelter for space travelers on Venus — the conditions are far too extreme for any human presence — the case that the planet may harbor them is building.

That’s in part due to the planet’s surface gravity being only around 91 percent of Earth’s, allowing tubes up to 0.62 miles across to be structurally stable, the researchers found.

“Our results suggest that lava tubes with widths of a few hundred meters may remain stable, and these dimensions are consistent with observed Venusian channel sizes,” the paper reads.

The researchers are now calling on “future missions with higher-resolution imaging and geophysical investigation capacities” to look for pit chains, rows of circular depressions that have been found on several planetary bodies, skylights, or vertical openings leading to underground channels, and subsurface voids.

The scientists used a common technique, called Finite Element Limit Analysis (FELA), to estimate the upper bounds of lava tube sizes that can exist on Venus’s surface.

The findings build on previous studies that attempted to model the planet’s “explosive volcanism.” It’s also not the first time astronomers have found evidence for the tubes’ existence. A study last year similarly concluded that lava tubes could indeed exist on the planet.

“Earth lava tubes have smaller volumes, Mars tubes have slightly bigger volumes, and then the Moon’s tubes have even bigger volumes,” said University of Padova researcher Barbara De Toffoli during a meeting last year, as quoted by New Scientist. “And then there’s Venus, completely disrupting this trend, displaying very, very big tube volumes.”

However, to confirm the existence of these huge channels firsthand could prove immensely difficult. Apart from an extreme local environment, the planet is covered in a thick layer of dense clouds, making analyzing its surface from orbit a great challenge.

Fortunately, NASA’s Deep Atmosphere Venus Investigation of Noble gases, Chemistry, and Imaging (DAVINCI) mission, which is tentatively scheduled to launch in 2030, will see an orbiter and atmospheric probe explore the planet’s surface.

An additional mission, dubbed Venus Emissivity, Radio Science, InSAR, Topography, and Spectroscopy (VERITAS), was designed to scan the planet’s surface with high-resolution near-infrared and radar instruments.

While DAVINCI has survived major budgets and was allocated the funds for an additional year, the fate of the VERITAS mission remains uncertain. The Trump administration’s proposed NASA budget would’ve killed both missions, but a counteroffer by Congress, recently approved by the Senate, has kept the hopes of searching for Venus’ suspected lava tubes alive.

            <h2>India has changed its startup rules for deep tech</h2>
            <p><strong>TechCrunch | 2026-02-08</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/07/india-has-changed-its-startup-rules-for-deep-tech/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Deep tech startups in sectors such as space, semiconductors, and biotech take far longer to mature than conventional ventures. Because of that India is adjusting its startup rules, and mobilizing public capital, hoping to help more of them make it to commercial products.

This week, the Indian government updated its startup framework, doubling the period for which deep tech companies are treated as startups to 20 years and raising the revenue threshold for startup-specific tax, grant, and regulatory benefits to ₹3 billion (about $33.12 million), from ₹1 billion (around $11.04 million) previously. The change aims to align policy timelines with the long development cycles typical of science- and engineering-led businesses.

The change also forms part of New Delhi’s effort to build a long-horizon deep tech ecosystem by combining regulatory reform with public capital, including the ₹1 trillion (around $11 billion) Research, Development and Innovation Fund (RDI), announced last year. That fund is intended to expand patient financing for science-led and R&D-driven companies. Against that backdrop, U.S. and Indian venture firms later came together to launch the India Deep Tech Alliance, $1 billion-plus private investor coalition that includes Accel, Blume Ventures, Celesta Capital, Premji Invest, Ideaspring Capital, Qualcomm Ventures, and Kalaari Capital, with chipmaker Nvidia acting as an adviser.

For founders, these changes may fix what some see as an artificial pressure point. Under the previous framework,  companies often risked losing startup status while still pre-commercial, creating a “false failure signal” that judged science-led ventures on policy timelines rather than technological progress, said Vishesh Rajaram, founding partner at Speciale Invest, an Indian deep tech venture capital firm.

“By formally recognizing deep tech as different, the policy reduces friction in fundraising, follow-on capital, and engagement with the state, which absolutely shows up in a founder’s operating reality over time,” Rajaram told TechCrunch.

Still, investors say access to capital remains a more binding constraint, particularly beyond the early stages. “The biggest gap has historically been funding depth at Series A and beyond, especially for capital-intensive deep tech companies,” Rajaram said. That is where the government’s earlier RDI fund is meant to play a complementary role.

“The real benefit of the RDI framework is to increase the funding available to deep tech companies at early and growth stages,” said Arun Kumar, managing partner at Celesta Capital. By routing public capital through venture funds with tenors similar to private capital, he said, the fund is designed to address chronic gaps in follow-on funding without altering the commercial criteria that govern private investment decisions.

Siddarth Pai, founding partner at 3one4 Capital and co-chair of regulatory affairs at the Indian Venture and Alternate Capital Association, said India’s deep tech framework avoids a “graduation cliff” that has historically cut companies off from support just as they scale.

These policy changes come as the RDI fund is beginning to take shape operationally, Pai said, with the first batch of fund managers identified and the process of selecting venture and private equity managers under way.

While private capital for deep tech already exists in India — particularly in areas such as biotech — Pai told TechCrunch the RDI Fund is intended to act as a nucleus around which greater capital formation can occur. Unlike a traditional fund-of-funds, he noted, the vehicle is also designed to take direct positions and provide credit and grants to deep tech startups.

In terms of scale, India remains an emerging rather than dominant deep tech market. Indian deep tech startups have raised $8.54 billion in total to date, but recent data point to renewed momentum. Indian deep tech startups raised $1.65 billion in 2025, a sharp rebound from $1.1 billion in each of the previous two years after funding peaked at $2 billion in 2022, per Tracxn. The recovery suggests growing investor confidence, particularly in areas aligned with national priorities such as advanced manufacturing, defence, climate technologies, and semiconductors.

“Overall, the pickup in funding suggests a gradual move toward longer-horizon investing,” said Neha Singh, co-founder of Tracxn.

In comparison, U.S. deep tech startups raised about $147 billion in 2025, more than 80 times the amount deployed in India that year, while China accounted for roughly $81 billion, data from Tracxn shows.

The disparity highlights the challenge India faces in building capital-intensive technologies, even with its wealth of engineering talent. So the hope is that these moves by the Indian government will lead to more investor participation over the medium term.

For global investors, New Delhi’s framework change is being read as a signal of longer-term policy intent rather than a trigger for immediate shifts in allocation. “Deep tech companies operate on seven- to twelve-year horizons, so regulatory recognition that stretches the lifecycle gives investors greater confidence that the policy environment will not change mid-journey,” said Pratik Agarwal, a partner at Accel. While he said the change would not alter allocation models overnight or eliminate policy risk entirely, it increased investor comfort that India is thinking about deep tech on longer time horizons.

“The change shows that India is learning from the U.S. and Europe on how to create patient frameworks for frontier building,” Agarwal told TechCrunch.

Whether the move will reduce the tendency of Indian startups to shift their headquarters overseas as they scale remains an open question.

The extended runway strengthens the case for building and staying in India, Agarwal said, though access to capital and customers still matters. Over the past five years, he added, India’s public markets have shown a growing appetite for venture-backed tech companies, making domestic listings a more credible option than in the past. That, in turn, could ease some of the pressure on deep tech founders to incorporate overseas, even if access to procurement and late-stage capital will continue to shape where companies ultimately scale.

For investors backing long-horizon technologies, the ultimate test will be whether India can deliver globally competitive outcomes. The real signal, Kumar of Celesta Capital said, would be the emergence of a critical mass of Indian deep tech companies succeeding on the world stage.

“It would be great to see ten globally competitive deep tech companies from India achieve sustained success over the next decade,” he said, describing that as the benchmark he would look for in assessing whether India’s deep tech ecosystem is maturing.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The Super Bowl is happening in Silicon Valley this Sunday, and the Patriots-Seahawks game at Levi’s Stadium is going to be packed with tech money. YouTube CEO Neal Mohan is expected to be there. Apple’s Tim Cook, too. (He has become a Super Bowl fixture since Apple Music began sponsoring the halftime show several years ago.)

Longtime VC Venky Ganesan from Menlo Ventures gave the New York Times a quote about the whole thing, saying the Super Bowl in the Bay Area is “tech billionaires who got picked last in gym class paying $50,000 to pretend they’re friends with the guys who got picked first.” Added Ganesan, “And for the record, I, too, was picked last in gym class.”

Ganesan could likely afford a $50,000 ticket if he needed one. Menlo went all-in on Anthropic, setting up a $100 million fund with the AI company in summer 2024 to invest in other AI startups. The firm has also joined numerous funding rounds for Anthropic itself, both through its flagship fund and various special purpose vehicles. (Anthropic is reportedly expected to close a $20 billion round of funding next week at a post-money valuation of $350 billion.)

Tickets are expensive across the board, averaging almost $7,000 according to the Times (with some last-minute seats still available on StubHub for closer to $3,600, according to a quick glance at the ticket reseller site). Only a quarter go to the general public; the rest are distributed to NFL teams. Of all ticket buyers, the largest group (27%) is coming from Washington State for the Seahawks, who’ve won just one Super Bowl in franchise history compared with the Patriots’ six titles, all with Tom Brady at quarterback.

Google, OpenAI, Anthropic, Amazon, and Meta are splashing out for competing ads about whose AI is best for customers, so maybe their respective CEOs will show up, too. Other than Amazon’s Andy Jassy, who reportedly splits his time between Seattle and Santa Monica, all of them have homes within an hour or so of Sunday’s game.

This is just the third time the Bay Area has hosted the Super Bowl. The first time was in 1985 at Stanford Stadium, the original football stadium at Stanford University, where the 49ers beat the Dolphins. The second took place 10 years ago at Levi’s Stadium, when the Broncos beat the Panthers.

The announcement has not gone over well on social media. On Reddit, for example, one user described it as “literally a conflict of interest,” while another described Kalshi as “cancerous” and yet another wondered, “is this even allowed.”

According to The Athletic, the NBA’s recent collective bargaining agreement allows players to advertise and take stakes of up to 1% in sports betting companies, as long as they’re not promoting league-related wagers.

Kalshi said it will partner with Antetokounmpo on marketing and live events — and in accordance with the company’s “strict terms of service that ban insider trading and market manipulation,” he will not be allowed to trade on markets related to the NBA.

            <h2>New York lawmakers propose a three-year pause on new data centers</h2>
            <p><strong>TechCrunch | 2026-02-07</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/07/new-york-lawmakers-propose-a-three-year-pause-on-new-data-centers/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">New Yorker state lawmakers have introduced a bill that would impose a moratorium of at least three years on permits tied to the construction and operation of new data centers. While the bill’s prospects are uncertain, Wired reports that New York is at least the sixth state to consider pausing construction of new data centers.

As tech companies plan to spend ever-increasing amounts of money to build AI infrastructure, both Democrats and Republicans have expressed concerns about the impact those data centers might have on surrounding communities. Studies have also linked data centers to increased home electricity bills.

Critics include progressive Senator Bernie Sanders, who has called for a national moratorium, as well as conservative Florida Governor Ron De Santis, who said data centers will lead to “higher energy bills just so some chatbot can corrupt some 13 year old kid online.”

More than 230 environmental groups including Food & Water Watch, Friends of the Earth, and Greenpeace recently signed an open letter to Congress calling for a national moratorium on the construction of new data centers.

Eric Weltman of Food & Water Watch told Wired that the New York bill — sponsored by state senator Liz Krueger and assemblymember Anna Kelles, both Democrats — was “our idea.” Data center pauses have also been proposed by Democrats in Georgia, Vermont, and Virginia, while Republicans sponsored similar bills in Maryland and Oklahoma.

According to Politico, Krueger described her state as “completely unprepared” for the “massive data centers” that are “gunning for New York.”

“It’s time to hit the pause button, give ourselves some breathing room to adopt strong policies on data centers, and avoid getting caught in a bubble that will burst and leave New York utility customers footing a huge bill,” she said.

Last month, New York Governor Kathy Hochul announced a new initiative called Energize NY Development, which her office said would both modernize the way large energy users (i.e., data centers) would connect to the grid while also requiring them to “pay their fair share.”

            <p><strong>TechCrunch | 2026-02-07</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/06/benchmark-raises-225m-in-special-funds-to-double-down-on-cerebras/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">This week, AI chipmaker Cerebras Systems announced that it raised $1 billion in fresh capital at a valuation of $23 billion — a nearly threefold increase from the $8.1 billion valuation the Nvidia rival had reached just six months earlier.

While the round was led by Tiger Global, a huge part of the new capital came from one of the company’s earliest backers: Benchmark Capital. The prominent Silicon Valley firm invested at least $225 million in Cerebras’ latest round, according to a person familiar with the deal.

Benchmark first bet on 10-year-old Cerebras when it led the startup’s $27 million Series A in 2016. Since Benchmark deliberately keeps its funds under $450 million, the firm raised two separate vehicles, both called ‘Benchmark Infrastructure,’ according to regulatory filings. According to the person familiar with the deal, these vehicles were created specifically to fund the Cerebras investment.

What sets Cerebras apart is the sheer physical scale of its processors. The company’s Wafer Scale Engine, its flagship chip announced in 2024, measures approximately 8.5 inches on each side and packs 4 trillion transistors into a single piece of silicon. To put that in perspective, the chip is manufactured from nearly an entire 300-millimeter silicon wafer, the circular discs that serve as the foundation for all semiconductor production. Traditional chips are thumbnail-sized fragments cut from these wafers; Cerebras instead uses almost the whole circle.

This architecture delivers 900,000 specialized cores working in parallel, allowing the system to process AI calculations without shuffling data between multiple separate chips (a major bottleneck in conventional GPU clusters). The company says the design enables AI inference tasks to run more than 20 times faster than competing systems.

The funding comes as Cerebras, based in Sunnyvale, Calif., gains momentum in the AI infrastructure race. Last month, Cerebras signed a multi-year agreement worth more than $10 billion to provide 750 megawatts of computing power to OpenAI. The partnership, which extends through 2028, aims to help OpenAI deliver faster response times for complex AI queries. (OpenAI CEO Sam Altman is also an investor in Cerebras.)

Cerebras claims its systems, built with its proprietary chips designed for AI use, are faster than Nvidia’s chips.

The company’s path to going public has been complicated by its relationship with G42, a UAE-based AI firm that accounted for 87% of Cerebras’ revenue as of the first half of 2024. G42’s historical ties to Chinese technology companies triggered a national security review by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, bumping back Cerebras’ initial IPO plans and even prompting the outfit to withdraw an earlier filing in early 2025. By late last year, G42 had been removed from Cerebras’ investor list, clearing the way for a fresh IPO attempt.

Cerebras is now preparing for a public debut in the second quarter of 2026, according to Reuters.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The war on California’s proposed ‘Billionaire’s Tax’ is getting weird. This week, amid ongoing rancor from tech elites over the much maligned bill, it became apparent that someone was planning a so-called “March for Billionaires” in San Francisco. A website advertising the event popped up online, providing little in the way of context other than a pithy tagline: “Vilifying billionaires is popular. Losing them is expensive.”

The immediate reaction was incredulity, and most people assumed the site was some sort of bizarre hoax. “this is a joke/satire right??” one social media user wrote not long after the news circulated. Now, however, the apparent organizer behind the event has revealed that the march is definitelynot a joke, and that it is scheduled to take place this coming Saturday.

The San Francisco Examiner first reported that the event’s organizer had been revealed as Derik Kauffman, the founder of AI startup RunRL, which previously participated in Y Combinator’s accelerator program. Kauffman told the Examiner that the event was not being funded or organized by any outside group, no big monied associations or companies—just him.

In a conversation with TechCrunch, Kauffman — who also told the Examiner that he was no longer involved with RunRL — confirmed that the impetus for the upcoming rally was California’s proposed wealth tax, which the tech founder said he believed would be “quite damaging to the tech economy.”

The policy in question, the Billionaire Tax Act, was introduced last year, and would require Californians worth over $1 billion to pay a one-time 5% tax on their total wealth. The legislation, which is backed by the state’s healthcare union SEIU (Service Employees International Union), could pay for important public services and help the state offset recent federal funding cuts, according to some experts. Nevertheless, the policy has led to loud protestations from some of the tech industry’s most prominent figures, many of whom have either threatened to leave California or have already left. It has also led to a monsoon of lobbying in the California legislature, in an effort to defeat the bill.

When asked why he opposed the legislation, Kauffman expressed concern for how the bill could impact the startup economy in Silicon Valley. “This tax in particular is fatally flawed,” he said. “It hits startup founders whose wealth is only on paper. They would be forced to liquidate shares on potentially unfavorable terms, incurring capital gains taxes and giving up control. Not to mention the difficulty of valuing private companies.”

“Many founders would be hit with wildly disproportionate tax bills,” Kauffman continued. “Additionally, there’s no precedent for this sort of comprehensive wealth tax in the US. Sweden eliminated theirs 20 years ago to avert capital flight and promote entrepreneurship and now has 50% more billionaires per capital than the US.”

Online conversation about Kauffman’s planned event has continued to alternate between incredulity and ridicule. “I can’t imagine billionaires marching in the street,” one social media user said, of the event.

Kauffman told TC that, so far, he isn’t aware of any actual billionaires planning to attend the march that has been organized in their honor. Kauffman said that the event is likely to include “a few dozen attendees,” although he stressed that he really isn’t clear on how many people would show up.

The ongoing outrage over the proposed tax is a little funny, given that it’s already been known for quite some time that the legislation has almost no chance of being enacted. That’s because California Governor Gavin Newsom has already stated that, should the bill somehow pass, he would veto it.

            <div id="article-text">The Civil War isn’t what it used to be. Instead of the romantic version, a “good war” of courage and glory, that emerged in the conflict’s immediate aftermath, or the post-civil-rights-era emphasis on the war as the vector of liberation for 4 million enslaved African Americans, a more recent direction has been labeled the “dark turn.” Grim rather than celebratory, it has chronicled the war’s cost and cruelty, exploring subjects such as death, ruins, starvation, disease, atrocities, torture, amputations, and postwar trauma, as well as a freedom that was rapidly undermined.

W. Fitzhugh Brundage’s gripping new book, aptly titled A Fate Worse Than Hell: American Prisoners of the Civil War, represents an essential contribution to this rethinking in its account of what was perhaps the most horrifying realization of the suffering and inhumanity the war produced. But Brundage, who teaches at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, does more than expand our understanding of a neglected aspect of Civil War history. His study offers a window into larger questions—about the evolution of laws of war and the definition of war crimes, about the ethical responsibility of combatants, about the growth of the nation-state and its attendant bureaucracy, and about the defining presence of race in the morality play of American history. As one Vermont infantryman wrote from a Confederate prison camp, “Here is where I can see human nature in its true light.”

At the beginning of the fighting, in 1861, no one anticipated that more than 400,000 men would become prisoners of war and that at least half of these would spend extended time in sites of what we would now call mass incarceration. The odds of being captured by the enemy in World War II were 1 in 100. In the Civil War, they were 1 in 5. As Brundage observes, three times as many Union soldiers died at the Confederate camp in Andersonville, Georgia, as at Gettysburg. Overall, approximately 10 percent of the war’s deaths occurred in prisons.

From the December 2023 issue: Drew Gilpin Faust on the men who started the Civil War

But prison camps attained this scale and significance only gradually. Both sides were initially uncertain about how to handle enemy captives. “What should be done with the prisoners?” the Richmond Whig asked. Treatment was largely ad hoc and depended to a considerable degree on individual commanders, but customarily prisoners would be exchanged or placed on parole—granted their freedom but required by oath not to return to military action. Rooted in assumptions about gentlemen’s honor and the integrity of pledges, the notion of parole now seems quaint, and it disappeared as the brutality of the war escalated. Some members of Abraham Lincoln’s Cabinet even argued for executing Confederate prisoners as traitors, but Congress and the public exerted pressure on the president to establish procedures to facilitate the return of captured Yankees. Formal provisions for the exchange of prisoners was not agreed upon until the summer of 1862, delayed by the Union’s reluctance to take any action that implied recognition of Confederate nationhood. Under the terms of the Dix-Hill agreement, some 30,000 prisoners were returned from captivity by the fall, but the formal exchange arrangement was soon upended.

The Emancipation Proclamation, issued in preliminary form in September 1862, provided for the recruitment of Black troops into the Union Army. Viewing this new policy as equivalent to fomenting slave rebellion, the South rejected any exchange of Black soldiers and did not extend them the protections of prisoners of war. They might be killed on the battlefield even after they surrendered, or remanded into slavery, or consigned to camps where they endured disproportionately harsh treatment.

Lincoln was resolute in his resistance to these measures. If Black soldiers could not be exchanged, no soldiers would be exchanged. The Dix-Hill agreement was suspended, and the number of prisoners of war grew exponentially; the result was camps the size of cities and untold misery for thousands of men in both the North and the South. Only during the last months of the war, with slavery disintegrating and northern victory all but assured, did exchanges resume.

Brundage characterizes the creation of the camps as an “innovation,” describing them as “experiments in custodial imprisonment” that exceeded anyone’s prewar imagination. These were modern inventions made possible by the introduction of railroads to transport prisoners long distances from battlefields, and by the growth of administrative and organizational structures required to manage not just mass armies but hundreds of thousands of prisoners. Although they emerged out of war-born imperatives, the camps were, he insists, a choice made by northern and southern policy makers alike, motivated by assumptions and purposes for which Brundage argues they must bear responsibility.

Both sides believed that any sympathetic act toward the enemy would represent an insult to their own soldiers. The Union commissary general in charge of prison administration proclaimed that “it is not expected that anything more will be done to provide for the welfare of the rebel prisoners than is absolutely necessary,” and that work on a prison camp under renovation should “fall far short of perfection.” During spring and summer months, he mandated that any clothing distributions include neither underwear nor socks.

From the July 1862 issue: Nathaniel Hawthorne interviewed civil and military leaders during the Civil War

But whatever the moral and logistical shortcomings evident on both sides, Brundage draws a clear distinction between North and South. “By any reasonable measure,” he judges, “Confederate prisoners were better kept than their Union counterparts.” Southern officials, he concludes, “never fully accepted the obligation to provide for prisoners of war.” Union prisoners were regarded not as human beings but as “a security liability that imposed no ethical imperative.” The South housed its captives in ill-adapted existing spaces. Richmond’s Libby Prison was a converted tobacco factory; the Salisbury, North Carolina, prison had been a textile mill; camps in Montgomery and Tuscaloosa, Alabama, and Macon, Georgia, were former slave jails. At the notorious Andersonville camp, no structures were provided at all. Men were not even issued tents but scrounged to procure shirts, blankets, or other bits of cloth to drape over sticks of wood to create what they called “shebangs.” Those unable to find cloth or wood dug holes in the ground.

The Union, in contrast, erected barracks and designed purpose-built enclosures for this new experiment in large-scale imprisonment. Those overseeing Union prison camps acknowledged that providing food and shelter for captives was indeed a moral obligation, even if on numerous occasions they failed to deliver adequately on that commitment. Yet the 25 percent death rate at the North’s worst prison, in Elmira, New York, came close to that at Andersonville (29 percent); overall, the mortality rate was 16 percent for Union prisoners and 12 percent for Confederates. Cruelty and corruption recognized no regional boundaries, and officials on both sides seem to have come closer to despising than sympathizing with their suffering captives.

There is a long tradition—born in the midst of the war itself—of accusation and debate about which side behaved worse. Defending the South’s treatment of its prisoners became a central theme for the neo-Confederates of the Lost Cause as the movement to rehabilitate the South emerged in the late 19th century. The blame for the surge in incarceration in 1863 and beyond should rest with the Union, they contended, for it was the North that halted the prisoner exchange. Pressing the advantage of their superior numbers, the North mercilessly kept captured Confederates in prison camps to prevent them from returning to the field to replenish the South’s diminishing ranks. The North’s decisions about prisoner exchanges were based on military calculations, not benevolent concern for Black captives. The South, they argued, did its best with its prisoners, given the scarcities of resources available to Confederate soldiers and citizens alike, scarcities they blamed on the Union effort to destroy the southern economy by blockading ports.

Professional historians in the early 20th century were not as explicitly partisan as the United Daughters of the Confederacy and their supporters. Yet, influenced by William B. Hesseltine’s field-defining Civil War Prisons, published in 1930, they adopted a kind of everybody-inevitably-made-mistakes approach that exonerated Confederates of any intentional moral failings. At the same time, they attributed to the North a vindictiveness arising from “abolitionist propaganda” that exaggerated Confederate prison atrocities.

The first comprehensive—one might say encyclopedic—study of prison camps since Hesseltine, Brundage’s book challenges these arguments head-on and assigns responsibility to the South’s unwavering commitment to slavery and Black subordination. Post-civil-rights-era attitudes about the equality of African Americans have prompted a different assessment of who caused the breakdown in prisoner exchanges, and thus bore the onus for the suffering and death that ensued: It was the South’s refusal to recognize Black soldiers as free men and thus treat them as prisoners of war, not Lincoln’s principled reaction to this Confederate policy, that produced such large numbers of Civil War captives. And Brundage ensures that his readers will not dismiss the record of prison atrocities. Although he offers examples of miseries from both northern and southern camps, his portrait of Andersonville leaves the most vivid impression of what the war’s moral compromises came to mean.

Andersonville was not created until February 1864, but in the months that followed, as many as 90 trainloads, containing 75 men to a boxcar, soon established its unprecedented scale. The camp consisted of a stockade erected around a 16-acre field by 200 enslaved workers commandeered from nearby plantations. Andersonville was designed to hold 10,000 prisoners, but its population reached as high as 33,000. The camp had no sanitation system, no barracks, no clothing allocations, and scant rations distributed uncooked to men without pans or utensils or firewood. Disease—scurvy, typhoid, dysentery—was rampant among prisoners, but medical treatment was worse than inadequate. In the prison hospital, made up of dilapidated tents, 70 percent of the patients died. When Confederate officials arrived to inspect the camp in May 1864 and again that August, they were shocked by what they saw. Nearly 13,000 men lie buried in the Andersonville National Cemetery, which the nurse and future founder of the American Red Cross Clara Barton helped establish on the site at the end of the war.

A great strength of Brundage’s study is the breadth and depth of his research; he makes deft use of a wide variety of evidence beyond the official records on which much earlier historical work on Civil War prisons has rested. He opens the book with a consideration of a series of photographs of Andersonville that in themselves make minimizing the horror and suffering impossible. A photographer from Macon, 60 miles away, seemingly compelled by pure curiosity, spent an August day in 1864 taking panoramic pictures of life within the camp stockade—the ground obscured under a sea of shabby improvised shelters; the swarm of prisoners gathered to receive rations; the men seated bare-bottomed over an open trench that would carry their waste into the same stream that provided their drinking water. Illustrations throughout the book support Brundage’s insights and arguments.

Yet perhaps even more striking than the pictures are the words taken from prisoners’ letters, diaries, and memoirs. Brundage accompanies his narrative of evolving prison policies with voices and stories of individual men. “Are we to be exchanged, or are we to be left here to perish?” asked Orin H. Brown, William H. Johnson, and William Wilson, three Black Union sailors, in the summer of 1863, still packed into a crowded Charleston prison half a year after their ship had surrendered and their captured comrades, all of them white, had been exchanged. Somehow their petition—miraculously evading Confederate interception and traveling, via the Bahamas, to Washington—arrived on the Navy secretary’s desk, though they likely weren’t released until the end of the war. For Frederic Augustus James, a prisoner at Salisbury, unreliable mail was one of many sources of agony; he learned of his 8-year-old daughter’s death five months after the fact, a succession of his wife’s letters having never reached him. Four months after his transfer to Andersonville, he died of dysentery.

William Hesseltine and his followers had dismissed such sources as at best partial and at worst partisan in their exposition of the cruelties inflicted by their wartime enemies. Brundage approaches these materials with an appropriately critical eye, demonstrating their consistency with other records and their value in providing deeper human insight into prisoners’ experiences. What Hesseltine claimed as objective history, Brundage both tells and shows us, was in actuality far from objective; it placed the story in the hands of the official record keepers while silencing those who were the victims of their decisions and policies. Incorporating their accounts, Brundage provides his readers with a far richer and more complete version of the past.

At the same time, he casts his book as being about the present and the future as well. Mass internment, as he portrays it, is a product of modernity, made possible by technology and growing organizational and logistical capacities. But it was also a deliberate choice, a callous and conscious decision. “What combination of institutional authority and procedures,” he asks, “eroded the moral inhibitions of officials, commanders, and camp staff, thereby making it easier for them to abandon the responsibility they might otherwise have felt to ease the suffering of the fellow humans” at Andersonville? It is hard to look at the most terrible pictures of captives ultimately returned to the North without seeing in one’s mind the photographs of those liberated from Nazi concentration camps eight decades later.

Yet the demands of modernity produced some humane outcomes that also presaged the future. The dilemma of how to deal with Civil War prisoners served as a catalyst for General Orders No. 100, issued by the War Department in 1863. It was the first systematic codification of the rules of war and became the foundation for modern international humanitarian law. It led to the trial and subsequent execution at the war’s end of Henry Wirz, the commander at Andersonville, for conspiring “to impair the lives of Union prisoners.” Northern prosecutors had hoped to charge top Confederate leadership, including President Jefferson Davis, in a series of postwar trials. In the end, Wirz was their only major conviction, because southern outrage and northern demands to forgive and forget brought an end to the legal effort. But Wirz’s trial represented the origin of modern prosecution of war crimes.

“Military necessity,” General Orders No. 100 directs, “does not admit of cruelty.” In the Civil War’s prison camps, it did just that. Yet the statement encodes an aspiration and an expectation, if not always an enforceable law. Born of Civil War suffering, international humanitarian law demands, as does Brundage’s important book, that we recognize cruelty as a choice.

Not all TV shows need to run for years to tell their story right. For anybody looking to watch a one-and-done season, The Atlantic’s writers and editors answer the question: What is your favorite miniseries?

Americans can’t seem to get enough of murder mysteries, and Hollywood can’t seem to stop making them. But few, if any, can hold their own against The Night Of.

The 2016 miniseries starts with—what else?—a murder. Nasir Khan, a scrawny Pakistani American college student living with his parents in Queens, sneaks out and drives his dad’s taxi to a party in Manhattan. When he forgets to turn off the on duty light, a chatty woman named Andrea flags him down, and they end up back at her place for a night of drugs and sex. Nasir wakes up to find Andrea stabbed to death and has no memory of what happened. When forensic evidence puts Nasir at the scene, he’s locked up and charged with murder. But did he really kill her?

The Night Of unravels the yarn with lurid details and lots of plot twists. The characters are well developed and unpredictable—perhaps none more so than John Stone, Nasir’s gruff public-defense attorney. Played by John Turturro, he spends almost as much time trying to free Nasir from prison as he does kvetching about his eczema. But the real genius of The Night Of is how it inverts the whodunit: The question of who killed Andrea is secondary to the devastating toll the murder leaves on everyone else.

Unorthodox premiered in March 2020: kind of the perfect time for a show about breaking out of confinement. Based on a memoir of the same name, it begins with an escape. Esty Shapiro, a 19-year-old woman from a Hasidic Jewish sect in Brooklyn, pockets a secret wad of cash, picks up a passport, and hops on a plane to Berlin, all set to the tense soundtrack of a thriller. Through flashbacks, we see how she’s come to feel stifled in her old life—by an arranged marriage in which she has little power, by the constant surveillance from her neighbors, by the hard limits set on her future. And we’re with her as she explores the world anew: putting on lipstick in a club bathroom, letting her wig float off in the ocean, falling in love.

The series doesn’t vilify ultra-Orthodox Judaism; it makes a point to humanize those Esty left behind (especially the two people, including her husband, who try to track her down in Germany). Unorthodox is compelling, in fact, because it captures a near-universal tension—between the deep roots of community and the dream of a different life, even if it demands risk and sacrifice and hurting the ones you love. Esty’s choice is never presented as an easy one. But deep in pandemic isolation, I loved watching her pursue freedom.

Sports fans and Downton Abbey connoisseurs may sound like an unusual pairing, but this six-part series about an underdog British team is sure to satisfy both. The English Game (developed by Downton’s creator, Julian Fellowes) is a charming yet provocative look at the origins of soccer—or, more aptly, football—in 19th-century England.

The show reveals the dramatics of the posh upper-class (back then, football was a sport for the wealthy) and follows how a working-class team makes its way to the Football Association finals, only to come up against an aristocratic club that has long held the champion title. It’s a story about social hierarchies, tradition, and how one game can reflect the values of a changing era.

Plenty of people enjoy Normal People, a 12-episode romantic drama, for the will-they-won’t-they of it all. Bookish, awkward Marianne falls in love with the much more popular Connell at school in small-town Ireland. She doesn’t know how to behave around him, and he’s a little embarrassed to be seen with her. When they both end up at university in Dublin, their roles reverse: Marianne runs with the cool, intellectual crowd, while Connell struggles to fit in.

But I love the show because it makes me feel a little sad. As with every project associated with Sally Rooney, whose 2018 novel the show is based on, Normal People is a moody tapestry of yearning and feelings left maddeningly unsaid. It isn’t comforting, exactly, but it is comfortably melancholy, like a rainy day spent wrapped in a blanket.

In my favorite episode, several characters gather in Italy for a weekend getaway. The scene is idyllic, but the characters are suffering—from jealousy and longing and an overall failure to communicate. A dinner in the garden soon devolves into pretentious sniping and, ultimately, an altercation that leaves a wine glass and a relationship in ruins. Beautiful, devastating, delicious.

The Perfect Couple (streaming on Netflix)

The show opens on the eve of Amelia’s marriage into the über-wealthy Winbury family at their Nantucket estate. But like all good soapy murders, a body—the maid of honor’s—soon (literally) washes up, plunging the entire wedding party into delightful whodunit mayhem. Based on the Elin Hilderbrand book of the same name, the series has it all: drugs, sex, gilded voyeurism into the world of one-percenters, characters named Tag Winbury and Shooter Dival, and, of course, Nicole Kidman—offering the sort of performance (all moody vibes and subtle facial shadows) that made me love her in Big Little Lies and The Undoing.

But here is the series’ true secret: It is a little campy, a little rollicking, utterly bingeable, and utterly ephemeral. Or, to put it another way, The Perfect Couple is a bit like cotton candy—delicious and then gone. It doesn’t sit heavy or make you contemplate anything existential (even as I write this, I can barely remember who killed whom, or why). What has stayed with me, however, is the flash-mob dance scene during the opening credits, in which the entire cast—including Dakota Fanning, Kidman, and Liev Schreiber—struts and shakes on the sand in their Nantucket cocktail finest to Meghan Trainor’s “Criminals.” Now, months after I first watched the miniseries in a single sitting, I still smile whenever I catch those lyrics: “Anything that feels this good, well, it must be illegal.”

Death By Lightning (streaming on Netflix)

A recent miniseries, Death By Lightning, had me fixated on what was a bit of unfamiliar history. The four-episode show is about the 1881 assassination of President James Garfield (played by Michael Shannon) by a mentally ill con man, Charles Guiteau (Matthew Macfadyen). The sumptuous beards alone are worth the watch. This is ultimately a story about America and the kinds of dreamers the country produces: Garfield was an idealist, and Shannon portrays him with earnestness and purpose—a man devoted to his family but also to moral causes, including keeping Reconstruction from falling apart. Guiteau, in his way, is also depicted as a dreamer. A uniquely American character, he is always scheming, always planning to turn things around and sure that he will—up until a noose is placed around his neck (a diametrically worse fate, I should add, than what happened to Macfadyen’s Succession character).

History doesn’t always lend itself well to television, and these figures don’t exactly have the name recognition of Abraham Lincoln and John Wilkes Booth. But the show is smartly paced and structured as a collision course between two protagonists and what they represent: a serious man who wants to fight corruption and speak to our better angels, and a chronic loser who nevertheless believes in his own value, if only the world would just recognize it.

Here are three Sunday reads from The Atlantic:

One of the pleasures of watching Ilia Malinin, apart from his indifference to gravity, is to witness him becoming. Becoming a world champion, as opposed to a juvenile with a skate-park mentality and a face like a Disney prince. Becoming a master of quadruple jumps that no one else can land, rising with all the ease of a young Michael Jordan—before landing on a pair of butcher knives, on ice.

Sometimes there are evolutionary leaps in sport, the arrival of athletes so physically dynamic, they widen the eyes with incredulity: the gymnast Simone Biles thundering in the air, the swimmer Michael Phelps coursing through the water with a wake like an attack boat’s. Malinin is one of these. In December, while refining his routine for his first Olympic Games, in Milan, the 21-year-old figure skater landed seven quadruple jumps in competition, spinning like a weather vane in a windstorm. No other competitor landed more than four.

Take a look at these photos from the winners of the 2025 Close-Up Photographer of the Year.

            <h2>Let Trump Keep Building Monuments to Himself</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-02-08</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/2026/02/let-trump-keep-building-monuments-to-himself/685903/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Donald Trump’s supporters really need to think bigger. A 15-foot-tall golden sculpture of the president—“Don Colossus” to friends—has recently been completed and will likely soon stand triumphantly, his fist in the air, atop a 7,000-pound pedestal that has already been installed at Trump’s Miami golf club. By the standards of leader worship, it might be too modest—Lilliputian when compared with the 40-foot-tall shining effigy that Turkmen President Saparmurat Niyazov built for himself in the late 1990s. That statue bestrode a 246-foot monument in the middle of Ashgabat and—get this—rotated 360 degrees daily so that it was always facing the sun.

At times, Trump’s desire to see his own outsize ego reflected in his physical surroundings, to wrap things in gold, supersize them, and then slap his name on them, seems to have no limit: the ballroom that ate the East Wing; the proposed “Arc de Trump”; the soon-to-be-gut-renovated Kennedy Center—sorry, Trump Kennedy Center. Now he wants to rename Dulles Airport and Penn Station after himself. Yet if he is hoping to match the grandiosity of world leaders of the past, he’s got a ways to go. Has Trump had an edition of The Art of the Deal copied out in his own blood (to rival Saddam Hussein’s very special Quran)? Does he walk around with a clique of female Fox News anchors carrying AK-47s (à la Muammar Qaddafi’s Amazonian guards)?

But the news about the statue makes you wonder about what new frontiers of presidential self-regard lay ahead of us. The project was organized by a group of cryptocurrency investors who raised $300,000 for it and have been using it to hype a memecoin called $PATRIOT. The sculptor, meanwhile, had no idea that his art would be used in this promotional way. Like many people who have worked on Trump-related projects over the decades, he is still awaiting full payment for his work, and he won’t release the colossus from his studio in Zanesville, Ohio, until the check arrives. As for Trump, he loves what he’s seen so far—“It LOOKS FANTASTIC,” he wrote in a letter to one of the organizers—and so not only will the statue most likely be erected in Miami before long, but a smaller version might also be headed for the White House.

Bear with me when I say something that many might find distasteful: Let’s have even more of this. The most effective way to highlight the unprecedentedly self-serving nature of Trump’s presidency has always been through moments when its abnormality is abject and undeniable. Moments that provide contrast. He separates families. He sends masked federal agents to terrorize various American cities. He calls his enemies “vermin” and “scum” and “Piggy.” For some of his fans, evidently, this is refreshing, the sign of a president willing to speak truthfully and shatter outdated norms. But mostly these moments have chipped away at his support, even among his voters, because they force everyone to gaze upon the true face of Trump.

Read: Looks like Mussolini, quacks like Mussolini

In case a reminder is needed: There is no tradition in America of presidents commissioning or even unveiling statues of themselves. Of course, there are a few famous postmortem monuments, including the Lincoln Memorial and Mount Rushmore. But even these can be controversial. When the sculptor Horatio Greenough created a 12-ton marble statue of President George Washington in 1842 for the centennial of the Founder’s birth, he modeled it on images of Zeus. People felt such deep discomfort at the sight of Washington in nothing but a toga and sandals—looking like he was relaxing in a sauna and showing off some admirable pecs—that it kept being schlepped around the Capitol, even landing at one point on the East Lawn, hidden in a shed.

Whether you are a president or not, endorsing a 15-foot golden statue of yourself suggests either an enormous ego or a drive to inspire fear—or both. In authoritarian countries where the Dear Leader’s image is a mandatory fixture in public or even private places—during the Cultural Revolution, a Mao Zedong portrait in your home was obligatory—it also risks telegraphing insecurity. The object of enforced idol worship might be compensating for being a mortal with earthbound power by literally representing themselves as omnipresent or larger than life.

Such self-aggrandizement has never been an attractive side of Trump—again, even for many of his supporters. Polls show that his voters want him to get things done: fix the economy and make it affordable, project strength on the world stage, make good deals. Burnishing his cult of personality is, for all but the most besotted or trollish, not on that list. Which is why those opposed to Trump might consider keeping quiet at the sight of false idols. Statues and nameplates reveal better than anything else how much his idea of power diverges from the traditional institution of the American presidency.

When oppressive regimes do collapse, the first thing people tend to do is topple the statues; this literal iconoclasm becomes an outlet for their relief and rage. Just over a year ago in Syria, when Bashar al-Assad’s rule ended, demonstrations of joy erupted all over the country and in many cases focused on tearing down images of him and his father. A huge bust in Damascus was pushed over, and people danced on its face. In Latakia, a giant bronze figure was knocked over and then dragged through the streets as people straddled its head like a Jet Ski.

These statues become such objects of derision not just because they serve as proxies for the fallen dictator and provide a chance to exact symbolic revenge. They also stand for neglect; they represent all of the resources and energy spent on glorifying the leader at the expense of the population. They are an insult because they express a set of priorities that subordinate the material needs of the populace to the psychological needs of the big man in charge. In Moscow, I once visited the Soviet-sculpture cemetery known, forlornly, as the Fallen Monument Park, a plot of grass filled with a bevy of Lenins facing in haphazard directions and a Stalin tipped over on his side. For all the storied ideals that sparked the Communist Revolution, this is why it died: It became a form of idolatry and forgot about the lives of people.

The prospect of a giant gilded Trump inevitably brings to mind a certain biblical story. While Moses was up on Mount Sinai receiving the tablets, the people of Israel grew restless and decided to melt down their jewelry and create a golden calf. They drank and danced around it like a bunch of crypto bros partying at Mar-a-Lago. When Moses came down and saw it all, he was appalled, as was God. The latter nearly exterminated the people he had only recently freed from slavery; the former came up with a milder punishment. Moses ground the statue into powder, mixed it with water, and made his people drink it. This, too, was an illustration of contrast. The big gold statue might be fun to pray to for a while, but if it smashes so easily, it’s probably hollow inside.</div>

            <h2>British Politicians Are Still Capable of Shame. Americans Aren’t.</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-02-08</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/2026/02/keir-starmer-epstein-peter-mandelson/685914/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">There is an irony to the undying Jeffrey Epstein scandal: It may never be more than an annoyance for President Trump, who knew Epstein well, but it could topple British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, who never met the sex-offender financier. Starmer has a 71 percent disapproval rating and leads the least popular British government since World War II. The reasons for the Labour Party leader’s deepening plight are moral, because decency and shame still matter in British politics. But they are also institutional. An American president is less democratically accountable than the British prime minister, because partisanship has disabled the checks that the Founders placed on the chief executive.

Starmer’s troubles stem from appointing Peter Mandelson, a Labour politician known as the “Prince of Darkness,” to be his ambassador to the United States. Mandelson was long known to have been friendly to Epstein but got the job anyway, replacing Karen Pierce, an effective career diplomat with warm ties to MAGA-land who did not particularly want to leave. Mandelson’s term lasted only eight months, ending in September when it was revealed that he was even closer to Epstein than previously realized. He had expressed fury at Epstein’s prosecution for sex crimes in a Florida court in 2008, writing to Epstein, “I think the world of you.” In addition, he’d signed an infamous “birthday book” for Epstein’s 50th birthday that also featured a lewd entry allegedly signed by Trump (who denies its authenticity). This was bad enough for Starmer, coming after numerous reversals—on matters such as welfare policy and inheritance taxes for farmers—and the resignation of 11 cabinet ministers. Like most of the fiascos of Starmer’s premiership, the Mandelson error was unforced.

But the revelations contained in the tranche of 3.5 million files released late last month by the Justice Department worsened the crisis. The records seem to show Mandelson giving Epstein confidential information about the European Union’s bailout. They show direct payments for unspecified purposes from Epstein to Mandelson and his now-husband (Mandelson has said he has no recollection of receiving the money). There is even a photo of Mandelson in his underwear. This is Mandelson’s third disgraceful exit from public life over his long political career, but it appears to be his final one. He is no longer a member of the privy council (which advises the king), the House of Lords, or the Labour Party. But even such a thorough torching of Mandelson’s political career might not be enough to save Starmer’s.

Idrees Kahloon: Political parties have disconnected from the public

Though voters gave Labour a large parliamentary majority in 2024, Starmer has seemed befuddled about how to wield it. Little has been accomplished, and Labour’s woes seem likely to benefit the Reform Party, a new nationalist, populist outfit led by the Brexit instigator Nigel Farage. A crisis over Labour Party leadership is now expected. The turmoil appears to be driving down the value of the British pound, and bettors think there is only a 33 percent chance that Starmer’s rule lasts the year.

The contrast with America is striking. For many American political figures, having palled around with Epstein is barely grounds for embarrassment. “It’s really time for the country to maybe get onto something else, now that nothing came out about me,” Trump said in the Oval Office on February 3 (he is mentioned thousands of times in the latest documents released, but there is no damning evidence of misconduct). Two billionaires in Trump’s orbit—Howard Lutnick, the commerce secretary, and Elon Musk, the Republican super-donor and onetime special government employee—both shrugged off correspondence showing plans to visit Epstein on his island years after his conviction.

The United States is supposed to be a puritanical country in comparison with godless Europe, but in reality it is so saturated in scandal that new ones elicit little outrage. A single dodgy ambassador—Trump has appointed many, almost all unnoticed by the public—could hardly bring down a presidency.

The controversies that have embroiled recent British prime ministers look quaint by recent American standards. During the pandemic, Boris Johnson’s leadership was hobbled by “Partygate”—boozy gatherings of government officials while the country was on lockdown, whereas parties at the White House during the social-distancing days may not rank among even the hundred worst Trump scandals. Gavin Newsom, who attended a dinner at the three-Michelin-star French Laundry during the shutdown, is probably the front-runner for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2028. One defining scandal of the short-lived Liz Truss premiership was that she proposed a tax-cut package without receiving a proper scoring from the Office for Budget Responsibility. (If only the Congressional Budget Office had such power in the United States, a country that ran a $2.2 trillion deficit last year.)

Helen Lewis: Britain should have read the tweets first

You would think that the British prime minister—who definitionally has a parliamentary majority behind him in a country in which Parliament is supreme—would be able to behave more like an elected monarch than the American president, who is supposed to be constrained by checks and balances. In the modern day, the opposite looks to be true. Parliamentary systems encourage palace coups because if you remove your party’s leader, you might be able to claim the job. If you successfully impeach and remove the American president, though, you don’t get to succeed him. The ever-present possibility of a no-confidence motion is supposed to keep a prime minister democratically accountable; impeachment is designed to be used in extreme cases. But its repeated use in recent decades—once against Bill Clinton, and twice against Trump—has proved its futility as a meaningful check on the president. In a time of closely divided and extremely partisan Congresses, the chance of a successful conviction in the Senate is close to zero—even if the president does something like try to stay in office after losing an election.

Congress has, over the past half century, also turned over more and more of its authority to the personal discretion of the president and the executive branch. When Thomas Jefferson was writing on the demerits of parliamentary government, he observed that “an elective despotism was not the government we fought for; but one which should not only be founded on free principles, but in which the powers of government should be so divided and balanced among several bodies of magistracy, as that no one could transcend their legal limits.” When there is no separation of powers, but merely a separation of parties, this intricate system breaks down, leaving an imperial presidency with exactly the concentrated power that the Founders feared.

They might also be saddened that 250 years after declaring independence from a tyrannical British king, the American system of government has arguably less democratic accountability for its leaders than the British one. But perhaps they would not be entirely shocked: The idea that there was something intrinsic to America that immunized it from autocracy was anticipated and deemed not credible. “Human nature is the same on every side of the Atlantic,” Jefferson wrote, adding, “The time to guard against corruption and tyranny, is before they shall have gotten hold on us.”

So if you just lift the cheesy poof fast enough, it&#39;s a life-extending workout?

So if you just lift the cheesy poof fast enough, it&#39;s a life-extending workout?

With my mom driving the golf cart, it&#39;s not that easy to pop them in the mouth! Not gonna lie, I think my reflexes are better than Bruce Lee&#39;s at this point.

About the worst thing you can do exercise wise is be car dependent.

If you&#39;re not, exercise becomes part of your day to day activities. You don&#39;t have to go to the gym just to keep a base level of fitness. Even if you then sit in a chair at work, you&#39;re still moving to get there.

Such a thing is almost impossible anywhere that puts the holy car in absolute prime position and relegates everything else to second place.

BIkes are such a win exercise wise. When I got mine, I had in my mind I&#39;d be doing all the 20km+ rides I used to do as a 20yo, and rapidly discovered that I was not nearly as fit as I was then and even a KM would wreck me. BUT short little burts every day of riding had such a noticable effect on my fitness. I still cant quite survive the 20km ride, but I can get 5-6km before the fatigue overtakes me, and that aint nothing.

Just ride four-five intense minutes at home on an exercise bike, without the outside rain,

Or the usual 25 minutes to work, but wearing a coat and waterproof trousers if it&#39;s raining. Problem with the former is I need to buy an exercise bike, need somewhere inside to keep it, then I have to actually consistently motivate myself to do even that minimal amount when I&#39;m hungry, tired, stressed, busy, etc etc. I can always drag my sorry carcass into work and I need to buy food to eat, which means that unless I&#39;m

Indeed. Also, walking is nice. It gives you time to think.

It&#39;s nice if your area and your life supports that.  Everyone is being enticed to work longer and harder though and soon you don&#39;t have time for it.  Especially if you are feeding a family of four by walking to the grocery store-- you could really only bring back enough food for one or two days so you are going to the store all the time.

It&#39;s nice if your area and your life supports that.

It&#39;s not so much nice as a choice. I picked somewhere to live that is not car dependent, and I vote with my votes (and have joined local organisations) who support non car travel.

I wouldn&#39;t try this somewhere which prioritises cars over all else since that would suuuuck.

Everyone is being enticed to work longer and harder though and soon you don&#39;t have time for it.

Do you not have traffic where you live? Certainly for me my bike is the fastest way into work i

For that to work, my work and the wives work, the kids school, music lessons, music store, swimming lessons, swim supply store and all other extracurricular activities would have had to of been within walking distance with shops on the way.  Then you need a house large enough for the music instruments and I have dogs so I need a pretty big yard for them to run around in.  Currently I have a 2500 sq ft house on an acre lot.   Does that really exist anywhere?

It&#39;s ludicrous to suggest we&#39;ve been thinking about it wrong. The standard wisdom about exercise has been healthy and beneficial. Lots of exercise is great for you. A little is perhaps better than we thought, that&#39;s all.

Lazy writing. Just a hair better than &quot;scientists baffled!&quot;.

These days, it&#39;s hard to find a headline about science that doesn&#39;t read &quot;Scientists got this point wrong for 40 years!&quot;
 Before that it was, &quot;this will revolutionize X&quot; and before that, everything had to have some practical effect. &quot;The modern day importance of 13th century Italian smut literature.&quot; Things like that.To me, it reads of recent years of deconstruction efforts. And this one is a doozy.  I&#39;ve been very active my whole life. Hard to imagine that 30 seconds a day is remotely the same as my daily running, weight lifting and multiple games of Ice Hockey a week.

I can&#39;t get my heart rate over 60 in 30 seconds.

I&#39;ve seen the recommended minimum excercise time per day shrink every few years for a long time.One or two years ago I predicted thst it would end up becoming almost nothing. Next will be the announcment that just thinking about exercise once a day will improve your health.

Worse than that, the exercise they describe is already routinely advised.  What they are advising against is cardio, merely one form of exercise.  Literally everything they recommend is routine and they offer no claim against cardio.  Lazy writing is kind.

Haven&#39;t fully read the paper, though I did get partway through the methodology chapter, and while they did some work to reduce the impact of reverse causation, I don&#39;t think they did enough to rule out the possibility that people who with healthier cardiovascular condition simply are more likely to move more.

The only way I would have a lot of faith in this study would be if they started with a numerical measure of plaque buildup based on MRI, CT, doppler test, etc.) plus the data about how much they exerci

Something else I&#39;m confused by is that they&#39;re talking about sedentary people, yet their data is plotted out to 85 kj/kg/day. If I&#39;m doing the math right, that&#39;s about how many calories someone weighing 180 pounds would burn by bicycling 240 miles every week, which is up in professional cyclist territory. How do they have numbers for sedentary people that are in that order of magnitude?1 kj is .239 kcal. A 180 pound person weighs 81 kg. So that is 81 * .239 = 19 standard calories a day.

1 kj is .239 kcal. A 180 pound person weighs 81 kg. So that is 81 * .239 = 19 standard calories a day.

That&#39;s for 1 kj/kg/day, yes.  Extrapolating that to 85 kj/kg/day is in turn just over 1600 dietary calories per day, which is pretty much right for a seriously sedentary person.

On the other hand, weight change is ultimately driven by calories consumed versus calories burned.  Someone with excess fat usually needs to improve both sides of that equation, and short bursts of exercise probably don&#39;t move one&#39;s basal metabolic rate enough to shift &quot;calories burned&quot; much.  That&#39;s where the ability to sustain exer

It might, actually. Of course attention will need to be paid to nutrition, but that&#39;s true no matter how much you exercise.

Good on ya! You&#39;re lucky, there are bugger all stairs near me.

Each year I race up a 50 floor skyscraper 5x, which is of course great, but that&#39;s only once a year.

The rest of the time I do intervals. It only takes 10 minutes a day. Domo arigato, Tabata san.

HIIT: high intensity, and low impact if you do something like run on grass or the beach.

It&#39;s free, outdoors, and the pain is over quickly!

Same here. I live 4 floors up. There is a very nice elevator. I only use it rarely, and only with good reasons. It does make a real difference.

Pop a pill of ozempic or whatever and go be fat somewhere else. Yes, any exercise at all is better than none, but that doesn&#39;t mean a proper regimen isn&#39;t better than &quot;climbing a few stairs&quot; twice a week.

Right now, what the US guidelines say are completely irrelevant to me. WHO has its issues... but Trump and RFK Jr. are like dropouts from the GDE program at clown college.

I always love to run up the stairs for no reason, and got 3 flights of them, even though it takes probably less than 30 seconds. Maybe need to do daily garbage/recycling rounds. But vigorous activity out of nothing without warm-up might have other nasty side-effects, your joints won&#39;t be happy.

There are currently exactly two SMRs in operation in the world, neither in the US, and there are over 100 designs in the air.  Contracts are not success, deploying actual working reactors is success.

Another concern is also how fuel efficient they are.

Deploying financially viable actual working reactors that deliver on the promised benefits would be the bar for success in my eyes. Ie not just a pilot, but a scaled program that delivers energy at a price that can compete with solar. I&#39;ll believe it when I see it.

You need to lower the bar a little. To be a true comparison, it needs to be when it compete against solar PLUS enough battery that can provide energy thru the night too. So if the SMR can provide 500MWh (which it will do continuously), then the size of the solar array + batteries needs to be able to give 500MWh for 24 hours in a row. I&#39;ll be charitable and not require enough extra to deal with cloudy days too, but so many people leave out the battery part when doing cost analysis/comparison. Otherwise, I ag

If we&#39;re going to get into the weeds of the comparison, then you have to think about the system service each setup is intended to provide to make the correct comparison. That&#39;s not an identical hourly output profile.

A 500MW SMR provides about 4TWh per annum of low-carbon energy plus firm capacity most of the time. It still goes offline for planned and unplanned maintenance, so it&#39;s not perfectly continuous and it has limited ramping. This is all assuming it does what it says it will do, of course. It&#39;s also

That is not how an energy mix works. And, incidentally, nuclear has never achieved 100% uptime and worse, has a tendency to SCRAM without warning. As a consequence, the redundant generation capacities for nuclear need to be much higher than for any other energy generation tech.

If we use self-redundancy (which is stupid, but what you did), nuclear needs to be run at about 150% capacity and these all need to be up with spinning turbines at all times, because nuclear is excessively slow to react.

because nuclear is excessively slow to react.That depends on the reactor, and the over all design of plant.

In general they are not much slower than coal plants.

That is not a good comparison though. You are asking solar and batteries to replicate what nuclear is good at. So nuclear will look good.

A better comparison would be to ask solar and SMR to produce power to meet demand over a 24hr period, where demand is highly variable. Both need significant storage to achieve this.

No reactor works continuously. 90% on, 10% off is reasonable for a well maintained one, not extended too far beyond its design lifetime. Lower for SMRs because they require more frequent fuelling, and are at this stage experimental.

You also seem to be confusing units. MWh is a measure of energy over time. An SMR is typically 100MW or less.

It&#39;s also a pointless comparison because no grid operates with one SMR or one solar farm + battery. They are all interconnected, all have multiple sources of energy, and a

You only leave out the &quot;battery part&quot; in your cost analysis: when you do not need/want batteries.

For example, you have a grid connection, and take energy from the grid when there is no sun.

Both of these are not suitable as prototypes or to validate the concept. The Russians have a repurposed submarine reactor, which is not a civilian design and they are not talking about cost at all. The Chinese have a highly experimental THTR intended to validate the tech again after the Germans wrecked all 3 (!) of the prototypes. The Chinese are using the old German patents and hope that advances in materials sciences and other engineering disciplines will make the design viable, and if so, they plan regular sized reactors based on it. The Chinese are also not talking about cost or at least not credibly so.

Hence for this supposed SMR &quot;revolution&quot; to happen soon, exactly zero working prototypes exist. That means it has a snowball&#39;s chance in hell of happening any sooner than in 20 years and that is only if everything works fine. Which it never has done with nuclear power and will not do so for SMRs either.

Not only are they going to build them, they&#39;re also building a nuke recycling plant, to get rid of all the tons of used fuel rods that have been collecting at nuke plants everywhere. All reactors have tons of used rods in cooling ponds, because we canceled the storage in nevada.So, expect clouds of radioactive iodine and krypton gasses crossing the us everytime they dissolve a new batch. Expect the contamination to go back to the ww2 levels, in the TN valley.I have a fallout shelter, and rad detection gear,

A lot of the big tech companies want to build huge, electrical intensive computing centers.

There has been a significant reaction to this because of the cost of electricity.  In some areas, the new electrical demand can drive up the cost for everyone in the area, not just the new centers.

They want to negate this issue, so they need quick, reliable, energy.   They have  concerns about solar and wind being unreliable, fossil fuels destroying the world.  That leaves geothermal which only works reliably in very rare locations, hydro which has fish issues (and the total transformation of the areas near dams), and nuclear.

When logical people look at well designed nuclear, they realize that it is far less toxic than fossil fuels, has minimal environmental dangers, and that the main issues are reputation.

Modern, newer designs entice them. They have the issue of being untested, but the &#39;move fast and break things&#39; motto of Big Tech does not fear the untested.     Whether or not this is a good idea for small nuclear technology as opposed to the software/chip business, well I do not know - and neither do they.

It is easy to understand why these aggressive tech bros want the nukes.   But I would not want to live near their first facilities.  Hopefully they will be smart enough to build them far enough from population centers.

Maybe you&#39;ve not be watching?  Trump tends to steam-roll regulations.  And Congress is doing nothing to stop him.  That&#39;s why everyone thinks this is right moment to push stupid contaminating uneconomic ideas.

If any do get off the ground, you can be sure they&#39;ll leave a legacy of toxic waste and a future cleanup burden.  Oh, and our electricity bills will go even higher to pay for it all.

The nuclear regulations are of a special kind, though, as they are based in the deep, irrational, animalistic fear of the trumpistani elites of &quot;proliferation&quot;, that is, of someone else obtaining the bomb.

Reprocessing has been a no-no for many decades precisely because it is seen as a precursor to developing nuclear capability. Hard to believe that the epitome of this very elite, the current president, thinks differently.

Well if all you get from reprocessing is a weapon then that&#39;s worse than just burying it.  I wouldn&#39;t think that&#39;d be any sort of show stopper in current climate though.  Hence the dumbass push for defunct nukes.

It isn&#39;t what you actually get that is important, it is what you can learn to get that makes all of it bad in the eyes of the people who control the trumpistan. Don&#39;t take my word for it, look it up - the push for a total reprocessing ban has had only one consistent source through the years and it is the US.

Nobody fears the nuclear bomb more than the people who ordered it used to see what it does to unprotected civilians.

Well, the weapons are bad.  If that&#39;s the end result then the ban is sensible.  The reactors certainly aren&#39;t any good in the first place.

It isn&#39;t blocked due to a value judgement. It is blocked due to fear of other people being able to respond in kind to aggression.

SMR will not happen in the US.  Nuscale&#39;s UAMPS project in Utah is an case study in why such hopes are futile.  Costs escalate as regulators embiggen requirements around new designs, and pressure groups spawn like weeds to delay everything until the financing collapses.

What would it take?  Two things: 1.) Deep pockets that can fully finance the project without bonds and shifting interest rates, all up front.  2.) Sincere and unwavering legislative support, including legal exceptions from state and federal regulatory sabotage and pressure group legal attacks.

The former is conceivable, but we&#39;re talking about someone committing $10B+ for ten or more years, and that&#39;s hard for anyone, even Big Tech monsters: Yes, there are trillion dollar companies, but like all such oversimplifications, they aren&#39;t so liquid they can easily just sink that kind of liquidity into a nuclear project.  That&#39;s why they&#39;re grifting around, trying to wheedle deals with state government and regional utilities.

The latter is fiction: executive orders and other half measures are not sufficient.  What would be sufficient is a bill, passed by the Federal government, signed by a president, capable of surviving challenges in front of SCOTUS, because it will go that far.  That model has happened in the US in the past: TVA etc.  Today, our leaders are balkanized around extreme pressure groups and vocal minorities, and no rationality is apparent any longer.  The US isn&#39;t a place where things like this are feasible today.

SMRs will never happen on a large scale because they just aren&#39;t commercially viable. They have most of the downsides of full size reactors, plus some new ones, and the cost savings from serial production don&#39;t come anywhere close to offsetting them.

Renewables continue to get cheaper, are mature technology, and are being deployed on a massive scale even as SMRs try to work towards first prototypes 5-10 years from now. If they ever deliver a viable design, it will be completely redundant by the time they com

Do all the people who use to repeatedly write about &quot;disruptors&quot; now repeatedly write about &quot;tipping points&quot;?

This is either written by AI or someone who doesn&#39;t understand what a &quot;tipping point&quot; is. A tipping point is where a change causes a big impact on an industry. You need to have an industry first to have a tipping point. With no commercially viable SMRs in operation beyond two pilot plant AI is as much of a &quot;tipping point&quot; for SMRs as someone donating money to cancer research is a &quot;tipping point&quot; in curing cancer.

Well, as I recall... we used to see a LOT of blogs/articles/stories about &quot;disruptors&quot; which were nothing of the kind... and that was before AI was a thing. So I don&#39;t think we can blame this particular trend on AI.

&quot;believe clean energy around nuclear is going to be the answer&quot;...

Yeah, that&#39;&#39;s what the AIs in The Matrix said just before turning us into pod people.

The sun is the only one clean energy source - the rest are dirty to varying degrees. Nuclear is definitely not clean.

Someone well qualified in nuclear fuel chemistry that I know  doesnt think SMRs are going to take off. He says people have been talking about them for decades.

Essentially Big-&quot;Tech&quot; is putting a bit of money into them (typically a tiny amount) since that means they &quot;believe&quot; that they will need high amounts of power in the following years. That way they they believe that the current AI-bubble is not a bubble and that it&#39;s sustainable.

In reality those contracts are often for the power produced from those generators. So when the AI bubble will burst, they will no longer need that power. Alternatively (or in combination) those SMRs will never reach a point where the

Pleas stop the deranged claims. The only &quot;tipping point&quot; for SMRs will be when (1) an actual SMRs prototype runs reliable for a few years and (2) the cost of manufacturing and running it are actually competitive. That will not happen anytime soon and may never happen. Before both points are reached, the whole thing is wishful thinking. Not the first time and not uncommon with the nuclear idiots. They like to grossly lie about actual costs and then take a massive amount of money from the taxpayer.

Oh, and those competitive costs need to include full insurance. Anything else would be a lie.

Shooting something from the earth into the sun needs a lot of fuel because the rocket starts off with the rotational speed of the earth.

Very likely. While LLM-type AI can create attack code from CVEs, it is total crap at finding CVE-level vulnerabilities. Also note that in actual CVEs, the rating gets verified, because the ones that find vulnerabilities have a rather strong tendency to strongly overstate things.

Given various open source developers complaining about piles of AI slop vulnerability reports that aren&#39;t actually valid, it&#39;s the obvious question to ask.

And the other obvious question is whether it provided fixes.

I fully believe 500 real vulnerabilities.

But did the noise of bullshit ones make those 500 less likely to be fixed is the real question.

So basically they had Claude grep for &quot;memcpy&quot; and &quot;strcpy&quot;, and then had humans actually review to see if those two functions were being called unsafely.

I&#39;m only being partially sarcastic here. Having seen the slop examples that Daniel Stenberg (curl dev) has posted repeatedly, we won&#39;t know if Claude has done anything useful unless we at least see how much chaff was separated from the wheat by human review. If those 500 &quot;high security&quot; vulnerabilities (in Ghostscript? We&#39;re using Ghostscript in high secur

the cURL project just cancelled their bug bounty program because of AI slop garbage

But not because of AI being bad, but because of humans being bad at using AI.

It was not (insert your favorite AI here) that created the reports. It were humans who hoped to make a few dollar by copy&pasting code into ChatGPT. The misunderstanding is that some bounty hunters thought they can better use AI to find bugs than the project maintainers themselves. It&#39;s like when you think you&#39;re an author because you types &quot;Write a story&quot; into an LLM. An author can improve using an LLM, but to become and autho

And on top of that, they may be &quot;real&quot; vulnerabilities that are prohibitively hard to exploit or that do not even come with a credible exploitation scenario. Also remember the mountain of slop the cURL people have been getting.

Without detailed documentation and independent analysis of each of these, the &quot;500&quot; claim is simply nonsense and probably qualifies as a lie by misdirection.

And finally we would need to how many vulnerabilities this thing did not find and how sensitive the process is to prompt variati

Given various open source developers complaining about piles of AI slop vulnerability reports that aren&#39;t actually valid, it&#39;s the obvious question to ask.Very true.  Also makes me wonder if there is a consistent definition of &quot;slop&quot; across AI systems.  We should ask every AI to ask every other AI about that.  Figure out who&#39;s on first and grab the popcorn.And the other obvious question is whether it provided fixes.Depending on how good it is at the findin&#39;, you might not want to read the output of the fixin&#39;.  You can choke to death on popcorn that way.

An inflection point on the way to an unstoppable collapse into an irrelevance singularity.

They clearly are getting more desperate. Their business numbers must be even worse than publicly known.

...future AI tools will enable us to make bug free software. Not today, not soon, but it could be possibleAs for the posted announcement, good progress, most likely exaggerated, but still progress

The only small problem will be the text in the labels.

Instead of &quot;Ok&quot; and &quot;Cancel&quot; you&#39;ll have random strings, say &quot;Gker&quot; and &quot;Onfeellrp&quot;.

And they will change from version to version, along with the placement, colors and the other ui decorations.

Only if you are clueless. There is mathematical proof that LLMs cannot do that. See, for example, https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.075... [arxiv.org]

>  with little to no prompting>  tested Opus 4.6 in a sandboxed environment ... to see how well it could find bugs in open-source code

Oh shit, Opus 4.6 spontaneously found a bunch of bugs, no prompting, just boom here they are!

Man, I can&#39;t wait for all of the pull requests to fix them. Surely, it will spontaneously fix them all too, with tests and documentation of course.

In just a few short months the world will be bug free. As long as we all start using the big subscription, and more, today.

And who had to dig through those false positives to find the actual issues.

Further more, the article doesn&#39;t mention the security issues, nor the software it was found in. Just the number 500.

At least by competent IT security experts.What a real test would show is how many vulnerabilities and which ones exactly were NOT found. And how much the set of vulnerabilities changes with different prompts. Because that is what attackers are going to do.

I don&#39;t know what to make of TFA.  The problem I have is there is no information on the 500 provided.  There are just three examples and it isn&#39;t clear to me which if any of the three constitute &quot;high-severity vulnerabilities&quot;.

Ghostscript is where anyone would look for an easy source of bugs to find given it is older than dirt itself with relatively few eyes.  We have tools like syzbot that managed to find several thousands of bugs in the Linux kernel alone.  Just equivalent of grepping for strncpy et el is

The main fallacy here is to assume there was a lot of effort spend making old C code safe.  Maybe they did some fuzzing, etc. and this is great. But if I were takes to make legacy C code safe, I would go over and replace every open-coded string or buffer manipulation by a safe string or buffer abstraction. Yes, nobody want to do this, because playing with AI or new languages is so much more fun.

Even the fact that an issue was fixed in one caller of the function, but nobody considered the other callers before, tells you that the least possible maintenance effort was spend on these issues before.

...are false positives or low hanging fruit? How many of those are &quot;logging not enabled&quot; audit findings? How many would be reproducible and not annoy thebdevs when reported?

Probably most of them. And then there is the question of how many it did miss. &quot;Vulnerabilities found&quot; is an amateur-level metrics. What counts is &quot;vulnerabilities remaining&quot;.

All this shows is that the LLM may possibly be beneficial for attackers. If they just prompt different, they may find entirely different vulnerabilities. And the one type of code LLMs can write somewhat successfully is attack code, because it does not need to be reliable, secure or maintainable.

Hence while this is pushed as a &quot;success&quot;

What this actually shows is a benefit to attackers. To be a benefit to defenders, we need to know how many vulnerabilities it (or LLM-type AI in general) could have found but did not. Attacker can just try with variations and then get vulnerabilities this stunt did not find.

Let&#39;s face it:  LLMs are really crap at generating secure code and at finding non-trivial vulnerabilities. Any claim to the contrary is simply a lie at this time.

            <div id="article-text">It&#39;s heavier, more expensive, and has a lower power density than any Li batteries.  With lithium prices way down, sodium is no longer economically viable, at least for vehicles.  Sodium&#39;s place is in whole home power systems, particularly in regions with very cold weather, where weight is not an issue and the longer cycle life helps offset the greater costs.

If you&#39;re in a cold weather climate you&#39;re better off with an ICE or Hybrid vehicle.  You can always charge your hybrid from your home sodium reserve.

It literally says in the 3rd paragraph above:

&quot;It delivers 175 watt-hours per kilogram of energy density, which is lower than nickel-rich chemistries but roughly on par with lithium ion phosphate batteries... &quot;

LFP batteries for vehicle use are currently around 220Wh/kq, that&#39;s nearly a 25% power to weight difference.  Every extra kg you have to haul around consumes more power so you need more of a charge to get the same distance, not to mention the additional tire wear due to the vehicle being heavy.

I stand by my position - if you want to electrify your vehicle in the north, your best bet is a hybrid.

LFP batteries for vehicle use are currently around 220Wh/kq, that&#39;s nearly a 25% power to weight difference.Slightly more than.  220/175 = 1.257.  Sodium ion batteries would have 26% more mass per unit of energy.But it gets worse.  You&#39;re also consuming additional energy to drag around that extra mass.  About a quarter of the weight of a car comes from the battery, so by increasing the weight of the battery by 25.7% to get the same kWh capacity, the car probably weighs 6.4% more.A quarter of your extra power consumption from the larger battery is wasted, which means you need to increase the capacity by at least 4

Exactly.  But it definitely has a place in ground based power storage.  Homes with solar or large scale solar farms that need to cycle reliably every day.  The greater cycle reliability makes them very attractive for that.  Especially true in the north of course, but attractive anywhere really.

Now if all that hype surrounding the new solid state batteries turns out to be true, the entire industry is going to be overturned.

Sodium-ion usually has more challenge with cycle life than li-ion as well, as it tends not to form durable SEIs the way that li-ion does. Though it&#39;s hard to make definitive statements about &quot;sodium ion&quot; as a whole because it&#39;s a range of very different chemistries, with no clear winner yet.  Some are better in certain metrics but lose out in others, and there are so many metrics you have to consider (cost, cycle life, clock life, power density (gravimetric and volumetric) (both charge and discharge), energ

A quarter of your extra power consumption from the larger battery is wasted

You&#39;re kind of ignoring air resistance there. At highway speeds the rolling resistance from extra mass will be dominated by the air resistance. Around town you&#39;ll notice a difference.

You are greatly over-stating the effect of weight on efficiency. Yes, a heavier vehicle will be less efficient, but the effect is not that dramatic and virtually negligible for even a couple hundred pounds worth in a vehicle that&#39;s already 3000+ pounds.

I recall a test specifically with an F150 Lightning with a water tote in the bed, comparing efficiencies between an empty and full tote (~1600 lbs of water) and getting a difference in efficiency of only 5%.

So let&#39;s say the pack is 1000lbs and you need 25% mo

They will probably have applications in specialist vehicles. Construction equipment, trains, things where weight is less of an issue and performance is more important.

EVs work just fine in the north already. Lots of people living in the arctic circle get on with them just fine.

CATL&#39;s LFP batteries hit 205 Wh/kg in 2024, so &quot;roughly&quot; is doing a lot of lifting there. It&#39;s 17% heavier for equivalent capacity. And it&#39;s not just a little lower than nickel-rich chemistries, it&#39;s a bit more than half as much.

It&#39;s also not clear how valuable cold weather performance is, newer EVs use heat pumps instead of resistance heating, and share the cooling loops between the powertrain, battery, and cabin, so that the heat removed from the motors can heat the cabin and battery. They&#39;re going to need that system in place (to heat the cabin and cool the powertrain) even if a new battery type can operate at colder temperatures.

Sodium batteries don&#39;t differ enough from LFP in cycle lifespan enough to matter (not for this sort of use case, anyway), and the density is lower, so the only way they&#39;ll be competitive is if they&#39;re sufficiently cheaper.

&quot;If you&#39;re in a cold weather climate you&#39;re better off with an ICE or Hybrid vehicle. &quot;

Which is why RTO orders are evidence that while society talks a big game about caring for the environment, in practice, not so much.

It&#39;s heavier, more expensive, and has a lower power density than any Li batteries. 
No, sodium is much cheaper than lithium in the form that is needed to make batteries; recent commodity prices for NaOH have been 10x to 20x cheaper than bulk LiOH, although this isn&#39;t all the cost. The technology development is now to a state where complete sodium batteries are cheaper the lithium ones and has been for a year or so, and the technology is improving fast.

You are correct that the energy density is indeed worse, but that gap has also been closing in recent years. Modern Na batteries have better energy density than the Li batteries in cars from six or seven years ago. If you&#39;re trying to build a lot of cheap electric cars then the lower price is very likely more important than the cars being somewhat heavier and thus a bit slower.

Sodium USED to be cheaper... but the market is currently flooded with lithium which has completed eroded the economic advantage to sodium.

Take a look at the prices for consumer LFP right now - you can get 16kwh packs for under $2k.

Outside of very temporary glitches, there&#39;s no world in which sodium isn&#39;t vastly cheaper than Lithium. No one talks about sodium deposits or mining sodium because it&#39;s readily available all over 70% of the world.

There&#39;s a global glut in lithium right now, and manufacturing facilities for these types of batteries are well established.  It will be some time before even CATL can scale production to meet demand.

Sodium chemistries need to focus on what they&#39;re best at.  Once they scale manufacturing they can start going after markets they aren&#39;t good at.

Hmm, who do I place my faith in on this question, you or CATL? It&#39;s a tricky one, because on the one hand we have the world&#39;s largest traction battery maker with a long history of innovation in actually available products, but on the other hand there&#39;s this Slashdot poster who&#39;s got a lot of confidence.

Being snarky is usually a poor decision making strategy.  You don&#39;t have to put your faith anywhere though, the market will reveal itself.

Blithely dismissing the value of a new tech by pointing out the wildly obvious without addressing the less-obvious is also not a great strategy for decision-making. See my other posts for details of why Na is likely to win in some segments of the EV market.

Power density is irrelevant in a traction application when the size is determined by the energy density.

The extra weight could matter since it is already a problem with lithium batteries.

Thousands of vehicles are running around with these batteries for +10 years.

But even getting LiFePo4 (already much safer than Li-Ion and LiPo), is difficult and I found only a 100Wh power-bank. Nothing I use, including laptop and phone, actually needs Li-Ion or LiPo energy densities. They are either excessive or significantly too low.

industry’s transition toward a dual-chemistry ecosystem, where sodium-ion and lithium-ion batteries complement each other to meet diverse customer needs,While you normally get less range from sodium-ion, it balances out the low-temperature discharge problem. As such, while you sacrifice peak range, you get a more stable stable year-round range in environments prone to very cold weather. If integrated correctly, it could also act as a bulkhead against thermal runaway destroying the entire battery pack. However, solid state lithium-ion batteries are on the horizon (2030-ish) so that&#39;s not a huge issue.Regardless, sodium-ion battery technology needs to be developed further because we need all the battery chemistries we can get. Relying on any single battery chemistry is a way of creating an economic single point of failure which is ripe for exploitation.

I&#39;ve read that lithium ion batteries recover about 80% of the lost capacity when you bring them from -15C to 15C, not counting the energy wasted on heating the battery.  The sodium ion batteries supposedly keep up to 85% of their capacity at ridiculously cold temperatures, but as far as I know, they still have to be heated to provide normal current levels on output.  So maybe the sodium ion batteries lose 5% to 10% less range in the cold, but because they start

I think we&#39;re likely to see segmentation in the EV market:Na will win in:1. low-range, cost-capped EVs. Exactly like this first model. City cars, superminis, two and three wheelers. It will be a chemistry of choice in emerging markets because it fits local needs.2. Some types of commercial fleets, such as urban delivery vans, buses with depot charging, municipal vehicles. They have predictable routes, need cold tolerance, long calendar life, excellent safety, great reliability, low TCO.

low-range, cost-capped EVs. Exactly like this first model.

I&#39;ve always believed the low-hanging fruit for EV adoption are people who meet this criteria - 

1) Are a two-car family. 

2) One of those cars is due for replacement in the next couple of years. 

3) Live in a house or townhouse where they can charge at home 

There are tens-of-millions of Americans who would meet this criteria.

It allows them to have one EV car for driving around town and another car for those times when they want to drive to

It also depends how easy a charger will be to install in that house.  Some people have said that they pay someone $700 and it&#39;s done.  Thats fine if you only have one car to charge.  My house will need a lot more power cables to be run from the main panel end to the other end where the garage is, and other than putting a charger for each spot in the garage there isn&#39;t a place to put other chargers  unless they are on a post outside next to the driveway.

Why would you need a charger for each spot in the garage? Does everyone in your household commute 200 miles a day and need to plug in every single night?

They also made dual-cable EVSEs for exactly this reason. Two vehicles, one circuit. This is more a convenience than a necessity though.

I swear every time you post under one of these stories you come up with even more elaborate scenarios to claim that you - and by extension everyone else - simply can&#39;t make EVs work.=Smidge=

While you normally get less range from sodium-ion, it balances out the low-temperature discharge problem

That&#39;s not how this works.  Yes, range &quot;disappears&quot; when a battery is cold, but it reappears as the battery warms up (which it does during operation); the only range  actually lost due to a cold battery is that which you burn before the battery warms up.  If you&#39;re plugged into the wall and you preheat your cabin enough in advance of departing, the car will preheat its battery as well and the amount lost

In the summary, that&#39;s lithium iron phosphate, not lithium ion phosphate. I wish people would stop calling them that and instead call them lithium ferro-phosphate (from which comes the LFP acronym) because this is a mistake just waiting to happen.

I&#39;m excited to see the impact of sodium in delivering ever-cheaper EVs, given that upfront costs especially at the low end of the market remain a major barrier. I&#39;m hopeful that they may finally help to deliver on the promise of EVs for a new market tier that exploits the mechanical simplicity of the drivetrain and low-cost battery materials to undercut cheap new ICE vehicles.

But almost as interesting to me is the aux battery value. Li isn&#39;t well-suited to take over from Pb especially for heavier duty vehicles because it&#39;s more expensive, is more challenging for safety ahd thermal management, has poor cold cranking performance, has quite high fault sensitivity, and solves for the problem of volumetric density above all, which isn&#39;t the main issue for a starter battery -- starter batteries are all about peak power ie cold-cranking amps, which requires power density instead of energy density.

You need 5kW of power for two to five seconds, potentially at -20C.  And that&#39;s what sodium can deliver just as well as lead. They will do great on safety and abuse tolerance, ie frequent shallow cycling, the odd deep discharge, long idle periods, and bugger all thermal management. They have the power density needed, and their lower gravimetric and volumetric density than Li is irrelevant. The get rid of Pb recycling liabilities and will have fewer warranty replacements and generally last much longer. They can do the job of being boring, forgiving, cheap and cold-tolerant.

Li has behaved like other types of tech such as solar PV, wind or DRAM over the last 30 years, in that every year it&#39;s got better and cheaper. Everyone still has the expectation that this can continue, but LFP is getting close to its thermodynamic cost floor and may be reaching the maturity ceiling for process improvement. So we get further declines but they&#39;re more incremental and are delivered by scale, integration and financial engineering.

A thermodynamic cost floor is the irreducible minimum cost set by the fundamental mass, energy, and material requirements of a chemistry.

The objective reason for believing that sodium is going to make a substantive difference is that the raw materials cost for sodium-based batteries are much lower than they are for lithium-based batteries. And while it’s true that pack cost includes much more than cell cost:1. Cell costs are still 60 to 70% of pack costs, so cutting cell costs has a big impact on pack

A couple years ago, I got a job interview at a big-name university and I had to decide whether to go undercover or not. On paper, I looked like a normal candidate. But on the internet, I was saying all sorts of wacko things, like how it’s cool to ditch scientific journals and just publish your papers as blog posts instead.

I buy books all the time that I don&#39;t end up reading.

It might surprise you, but that&#39;s a common thing. People get interested in books, but then don&#39;t make up time for reading. A long time ago as graduate student I did not have internet at home, I was purchasing *and* reading a book every week, whether an essay or a novel. Now I have internet and also a busy life, and I can&#39;t make up time for reading anymore. I probably could, but there so many other things I can push forward even on nights and week-ends: my main job, my side hustle, a hobby (e.g. street photography), contributing to some FOSS, trying to play an instrument again, playing with the cat, or, you know, waste time online.

There&#39;s not a public librarian or public school teacher that would agree with this.

When reading 11 books per year makes you a mega-reader and even 1 book a year makes you a moderate reader I think we can safely conclude that reading is dead.

Throughout the 80s and 90s I consistently read 1-2 books per week, and so did most of my friends. Granted most people read less but a book every few weeks was totally normal.

Nowadays I read maybe a quarter of the articles in 4 online newspapers every morning, listen to the odd audiobooks but otherwise it is all video. If I had the same access to video

According to Goodreads via my Kindle...I read 85,323 pages in 155 books in 2025, down from 104,792 pages in 236 books in 2024. I was mostly retired in 2024 taking care of my mother.I know I read more than a few physical books but I am too lazy to input them manually into Goodreads.

Did Goodreads/Kindle take into account the variable number of words on a &quot;page&quot; due to ebook formatting?

In print books, since mass market printing appeared, the number of words on a page is fairly well defined due to standard physical page sizes, typefaces, spacing and margins.
This makes it possible to have a reasonably objective definition of pages of content, modulo a small number of variations in book formats across publishers: So we all have a rough idea of how many words can be crammed into an avera

Good point. I usually read at 5 pt font which is smaller than the default but your point is very valid. I checked and GR doesn&#39;t track anything of real value beyond the number of pages in a printed volume, but many are e-books only so who knows...

Please share your secrests for (a) keeping the cost down, and (b) making time to read.

The best way to keep costs down (legally) is to make a list of your local second hand bookstores and visit them in person. They can be specialized, but depending on your interests this means you have to hunt for the most suitable one.

When you visit, do not be put off by the books being in used condition, and sometimes in rough shape. You want to read them (presumably), not collect them. Since these bookstores also accept to buy books, you can recoup a percentage of the cost late

...has been greatly exaggerated. (to paraphrase Mr. Twain)

Short attention span is a real thing.  It has effected me and many others of my age.  Personal computers, the internet, and mobile phones all came along during our lives.  When I was young there was no (publicly accessible) internet, a trip to the library was a rare event, and no one was going to waste good money buying a book for a child.  As I grew up and had my own means, books became plentiful in my life.  As a teen BBSs came about. Downloads took FOREVER for even something simple. ... Now everything is available online instantly.  Information and entertainment in short, easy, bites.  I certainly feel the urge to switch topics as soon as something becomes &quot;boring&quot;, to sample and move on.

But... people still read.  The more educated people read a lot as they grew up and throughout their studies, and it is a habit they have maintained.  Those who struggled thru high school barely read then, and don&#39;t read now.  The children who grew up with phones and tablets in hand, they DEMAND that their parents buy them real physical books.  There are definitely generations in the middle who just don&#39;t read -anything.  They proudly announce that they have never read an entire book in their lives.  But, fortunately, they are not everyone.  Reading is a habit for some, and not for others.

Like the &quot;slight decrease in the percentage of U.S. adults who read any book in 2022 (49%) compared to 2012 (55%)&quot;, which is a decline of more than 10% in 10 years? I wouldn&#39;t call that a &quot;slight&quot; decrease in any meaning of the word.

Also, as others already noted, when reading 11 books per year is supposed to constitute a &quot;mega-reader&quot; then this very much looks like someone purposefully belittling the problem.

I don&#39;t even know where I could even get a hardcopy version of Moses T. Runnels&#39; two-volume History of Sanbornton, New Hampshire, totaling around 1,700 pages or so and published in 1882.  But I frequently consult the PDF version I downloaded from one of the numerous web sites that has it available.  Then there&#39;s my OverDrive Libby account, which gives me access to the holdings of something like eight library networks covering virtually all of a state, plus a university library or two.  I voraciously consume

I read more but w than I have in my past 50-some years. The difference for me was an electronic device, and a well known one you’ve certainly heard of, and some of you probably hate. It’s so easy to have a dozen or more books with me, they don’t weigh a ton, and I don’t need to worry about needing light to read by. I read an average of 20-25 books per year now. It’s replaced a fair bit of tv/movies/gaming for me.

            <div id="article-text">Sign up for the Surge, the newsletter that covers most important political nonsense of the week, delivered to your inbox every Saturday.

Welcome to this week’s edition of the Surge, which once again has had the NFL reject its pitch to perform a live reading of this newsletter as the Super Bowl halftime show.

The United States, and its news, failed to improve this week. Congress did fund the government but is already stuck ahead of the next spending deadline. Tulsi Gabbard remains at large. And while it’s not entirely about politics—though it’s not not about politics—we couldn’t resist a few words about the gutting of the local newspaper.

Blah, blah, life is sad—well, not anymore, because we’re kicking off 2026 primary season with Texas Week! Everybody grab two handfuls of sizzlin’ Texas chili (??) and git to reading.

We are less than a month from the start of 2026 primary season, as Texas voters go to the polls on March 3. This is welcome news to the Surge. Early primary coverage feels so distant with its talk of endorsements, “war chests,” and other lifeless stats. Now we can cover proper knife fights down the stretch.

The prime drama of the week came in Texas’ competitive Senate Democratic primary between state Rep. James Talarico and U.S. Rep. Jasmine Crockett, of Dallas. It started when Morgan Thompson, a Texas TikTok personality, said that Talarico had told her privately “that he signed up to run against a mediocre Black man, not a formidable and intelligent Black woman.” The Black man in question is former Rep. Colin Allred, who ended his Senate campaign last year and switched to a House race. Allred then posted his own video response in which he endorsed Crockett and trashed Talarico, telling him, “If you want to compliment a Black woman, just do it. Just do it. Don’t do it while also tearing down a Black man.” For his part, Talarico said Thompson had offered a “mischaracterization” of his remark, and that he described only Allred’s “method of campaigning as mediocre.” (Not a particularly controversial observation there.)

National Republicans, who would prefer to run against the more polarizing, partisan figure in Crockett, have greatly enjoyed this all. It’s been a welcome distraction from their own Texas problems.

Our view of the Texas Senate race has been that it gets way too much attention for a contest that Republicans are probably going to win by 5 to 7 points. It’s not among the top pickup opportunities that national Democrats are targeting. Democrats haven’t won statewide there since 1994, and they seriously backslid in the state in 2024. It’s expensive to run in. There’s always a lot of temptation, every cycle, for Democrats to believe that this time could be different. It never materializes.

All of which is to say: It’s temptation time again! The national atmosphere is lousy for Republicans, the gains they made among Hispanic voters in 2024 to fortify their Texas standing are evaporating, Texas Republicans just got dusted in a special election in what they thought was a safe-red district, and, most importantly, they have candidate problems of their own. Incumbent Sen. John Cornyn, who would likely win reelection to his seat if he made it to November’s general, is in dreadful primary shape. After $50 million in advertising has been spent on his behalf, it’s still not clear that he’d make it to a runoff in his primary against Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton and Rep. Wesley Hunt. Even if he did make the runoff against Paxton, he’d likely be at a disadvantage. If Paxton, another partisan, polarizing figure laden with personal and professional baggage, becomes Republicans’ nominee, Democrats will feel the Texas temptation like never before.

We regret to say that at the rate she’s going, Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard is at risk of replacing Lindsey Graham as the Surge’s go-to “Here’s what they were up to this week” entry. Not a good sign for America. We’ve learned of late that Gabbard, who had been out of the public eye for a while, has been running her own investigation into the results of the 2020 election and sniffing around old ballots and voting machines. She was on the scene at an FBI raid of a Fulton County, Georgia, election center last week and, as we learned a few days ago, apparently called the president from Atlanta and put him on speakerphone with the agents who conducted the raid. None of this is within the DNI’s purview, all of it is wildly inappropriate at best, any of it would be a major scandal that Congress oversees immediately in a functioning government.

There is more. The Wall Street Journal reported this week that there’s a whistleblower complaint about Gabbard “that is so highly classified it has sparked months of wrangling over how to share it with Congress,” and that it’s “said to be locked in a safe.” A redacted version of the complaint, then, was finally made available to a select group of lawmakers later in the week, with executive privilege claims getting in the way of the good stuff. We shall see. Elsewhere in Gabland: It was reported that Gabbard “obtained” voting machines from Puerto Rico to play around with them and look for security vulnerabilities. OK!

The Washington Post eliminated about a third of its staff and hundreds of journalism jobs this week in the worst single-day massacre of expertise and talent we’ve ever seen—even in an industry that’s been contracting all century. The Post nixed its sports and books coverage, axed much of its arts coverage, and gutted its international and metro desks. It is now narrowly focused on District of Columbia news and politics, making it less a swaggering international newspaper than a publication whose purview matches Politico’s.

The Post has gone through highs and lows going back decades. Yet the acute mismanagement of the past couple of years by its owner, Jeff Bezos, after he’d lost any apparent interest in owning a newspaper, is staggering. Seeking to protect his business before the government ahead of a potential Trump win in 2024, Bezos barred the editorial board from making an endorsement in the presidential race, costing the paper hundreds of thousands of subscribers.

Individual mega-billionaires are under no obligation to use their largesse to subsidize public institutions like the Post forever. (A gentleman, though, might backfill at least the hole he personally created by interfering with the editorial board.) They’re not obligated to do so when it collides with their other business interests. We do think they’re obligated, however, to find someone who is willing to carry the task forward. Rather than destroy a public institution because it’s become a hassle in various ways, sell it to someone who gives a shit.

Senate Democrats got what they wanted in the government funding battle that ensued following the killing of Alex Pretti in Minneapolis. Rather than extend funding for the Department of Homeland Security through September, it would be extended for two weeks while Democrats and Republicans negotiated some new restraints over immigration enforcement. The Senate passed this rejiggered deal late last week, and the House muscled it through on Tuesday.

It is now Saturday, and the sum total of negotiating progress that has been made is nothing. Democratic congressional leaders Chuck Schumer and Hakeem Jeffries put out a list of 10 demands—among them no masks for DHS officers, no roving DHS patrols, no racial profiling—which was met coolly by Republicans. “Democrats’ newest proposal is a ridiculous Christmas list of demands for the press,” Alabama’s Katie Britt, Senate Republicans’ lead DHS appropriator, said. “They continue to play politics to their radical base at the expense of the safety of Americans.” Democrats, meanwhile, say they are being serious—and it’s the Republicans who aren’t! Et cetera, et cetera, and so on and so forth. The conversation has moved largely toward what the next short-term DHS funding patch will look like, because a bigger deal to rein in immigration authorities does not appear to be in the ballpark of imminent.

A marked push from the most conservative factions in the House and Senate to pass a major voter verification and ID bill has kicked off, but it’s hitting the same old wall: the Senate filibuster. The bill in question was, at first, the SAVE Act, legislation that would require showing “documentary proof of United States Citizenship” in order to register to vote. Now there’s a new version—the SAVE America Act—that tacks on a requirement for presenting photo ID at polling places. Senate Democrats are fully hostile to the legislation, with Schumer calling it “Jim Crow 2.0” and saying it’s about “federalizing voter suppression.”

In order to appease certain House conservatives who were threatening to hold up the government funding bill this week, Senate Majority Leader John Thune said he would at least have a conversation with his senators about how to proceed on the SAVE Act and its successors. One idea that’s come up, as it often does during desperate times, is to force the minority to stage a “talking filibuster” to stall it, and wait for them to exhaust their parliamentary options. Those never happen, and for good reason: It could eat up weeks or months of valuable Senate floor time and force Senate Republicans to be on or near the Senate floor for most of that time. This is one of those discussions we’d expect to naturally dissipate on its own once it becomes clear how unpalatable all of the options are. But depending on how involved Trump gets, Thune could have to withstand a lot of pressure.

The U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia finally said something cool this week, then got in trouble for it. “You bring a gun into the District, you mark my words, you’re going to jail,” Jeanine Pirro said in an appearance on her old stomping grounds at Fox News. “I don’t care if you have a license in another district, and I don’t care if you’re a law-abiding gun owner somewhere else.” This didn’t sit well with gun-rights groups, who were already displeased with the administration for the way it talked about how Alex Pretti, who was carrying lawfully, shouldn’t have brought his gun with him to protest immigration officers in Minnesota. Elected Republicans, too, criticized her, with Florida Rep. Greg Steube, for example, telling Pirro, “Come and Take it!”

As Steube said in his own post, though, he’s licensed in both Florida and D.C. to carry. No one, regrettably, is going to take away Greg Steube’s gun. “Let me be clear: I am a proud supporter of the Second Amendment,” Pirro said in a follow-up social media post. “Washington, D.C. law requires handguns be licensed in the District with the Metropolitan Police Department to be carried into our community. We are focused on individuals who are unlawfully carrying guns and will continue building on that momentum to keep our communities safe.” That’s just a simple explanation of D.C. law that it’s her job to enforce. So she’ll probably have to keep apologizing.

According to Marc Elias, Dahlia Lithwick’s guest on Amicus, “This week will be looked back on as a pivot point in terms of how the midterms play out.” Elias is a nationally recognized authority on voting rights, redistricting, and campaign finance law. He is chair of Elias Law Group and founder of Democracy Docket.

In the past few weeks, Donald Trump’s election denialism has kicked into high gear, just as his poll numbers hit new lows. Elias tells us the FBI/DNI raid to seize ballots in Fulton County, Georgia, and Steve Bannon’s new threats to surround polling places with ICE officers in November, show an administration that is prototyping new mechanisms for election subversion and voter suppression. But the public has power in this scenario, especially if they start paying attention to elections and voting rights now, rather than the day before Nov. 3, 2026.

It’s been a bad habit for a long time, but it’s getting worse: President Donald Trump can’t utter a single statement without lying about his accomplishments or revealing, all too plainly, that self-glorification is what he cares about the most.

Take his post on social media Thursday, affirming—as was clear a few days earlier—that he was going to let New START, the last remaining nuclear arms control treaty between the United States and Russia, expire this week with barely a shrug.

He wrote: “Rather than extend ‘NEW START’ (a badly negotiated deal … that, aside from everything else, is being grossly violated), we should have our Nuclear Experts work on a new, improved, and modernized Treaty that can last long into the future.”

First, though the treaty—which was signed in 2011—no longer addresses all the salient issues of today’s nuclear landscape, it was in fact a brilliantly negotiated accord in its day, mandating the deepest cuts and tightest on-site-inspection clauses in arms-control history.

The real problem with New START, in Trump’s eyes, was the same problem that compelled him to denounce the Iran nuclear deal as “the worst deal ever” before he tore it up in 2018; he hates them because they were both signed by his loathed and envied predecessor, Barack Obama.

Russian President Vladimir Putin—who has, in fact, abided by New START’s numerical limits—proposed that he and Trump extend the accord by one year, but Trump declined. (The treaty allowed for a one-time five-year extension, which Putin and Joe Biden signed back in 2021, perhaps another reason—since he loathes Biden at least as much as he despises  Obama—Trump would rather scuttle the whole deal.)

Then, in this same social media post, for no reason at all (this is the bad habit that I cited at the start of this essay), Trump recites some fibs. For instance: “I completely rebuilt [our] Military in my First Term, including new and many refurbished nuclear weapons.”

This is untrue. Obama approved the development of new nuclear weapons for the entire “strategic Triad”: land-based intercontinental ballistic missiles, submarine-launched ballistic missiles, and bombers, as well as new warheads and cruise missiles. (Ironically, he agreed to this as a way of getting Senate hawks to ratify the New START treaty. He was also snookered into this compromise. He agreed to “replace or modernize” the existing arsenal, thinking “modernize” could mean, for instance, upgrading the software on a guidance system. The senators took the term to be synonymous with “replace.”)

During his first term, Trump didn’t add a single new nuclear weapon or accelerate the ones that Obama put in motion. In fact, the first model of the new B-21 bomber took its first flight  during Biden’s presidency.

Trump’s social media post goes on: “I … continue to rebuild our Military at levels never seen before.”

This is palpably untrue. The Pentagon is, by some measures, spending more money than almost ever before, but building—of ships, planes, missiles, or whatever—is not growing so much; it’s dwarfed by the rearmament during World War II or the presidencies of John F. Kennedy and Ronald Reagan.

He rambles on: “We are even adding Battleships, which are 100 times more powerful than the ones that roamed the Seas during World War II.”

This is Trump’s big fantasy, stemming from romanticized memories of watching Victory at Sea, the WWII documentary on TV. But no naval officer wants to revive such relics, and it’s extremely unlikely the gigantic boats will ever be built.

Then came this puzzler: “I have stopped Nuclear Wars from breaking out across the World between Pakistan and India, Iran and Israel, and Russia and Ukraine.”

One might have thought Trump had done enough distorting of his record as peacemaker by claiming that he’d “ended eight-plus wars” (most of which either haven’t yet ended or were ended by actors other than Trump). But this new boast, that he’d “stopped Nuclear Wars from breaking out” shows him engaging in new realms of self-delusion.

The latest round of skirmishes between India and Pakistan hardly escalated at all, much less to the brink of nuclear exchanges, before the fighting stopped. (When Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi scoffed at Trump’s earlier claim of credit for negotiating the peace, Trump slapped him with 50 percent tariffs, a step he has since reversed.)

Nuclear war between Iran and Israel wasn’t remotely in the offing, in part because Iran doesn’t have nuclear weapons. Maybe Trump was thinking that his bombing campaign, which he claimed “obliterated” Iran’s nuclear program, preempted this possibility. But now satellite images reveal that Iran is repairing the damage done, suggesting he didn’t obliterate the sites after all.

As for Russia and Ukraine, one could argue that by halting weapons deliveries to Ukraine, Trump thwarted Ukraine’s counteroffensive, thus calming Putin’s fear of losing the war, a prospect he might have blocked by going nuclear—but the logical thread is dubious, and in any case this was an act of appeasement, not peace.

Then, Trump returns to New START. Rather than extending it for a year, he writes, “we should have our Nuclear Experts work on a new, improved, and modernized Treaty that can last long into the future.”

Ah, yes, a “better” New START, just as Trump talked about a “better” Iran nuclear deal back in 2018 after he ripped up the accord signed by the dread Barack Obama. But he never even tried to negotiate an improved Iran deal; he was hoping, perhaps assuming, that his campaign of “maximum pressure” would bring down Tehran’s regime. (It didn’t; it only accelerated its nuclear program.) It’s unclear what he’s aiming for in refusing to extend New START, but it’s just as unlikely he’ll initiate new strategic arms talks, in part because his administration has no “Nuclear Experts,” none with experience at negotiating arms treaties anyway.

A few days before Trump nailed the coffin on New START, Axios reported that the U.S. and Russia were “closing in on a deal” to extend the treaty. The story further reported that the idea had been proposed, at a recent meeting with Russian diplomats, by Jared Kushner and Steve Witkoff. And why not? Trump has been using this overmatched duo—his son-in-law and his fellow real-estate tycoon—as stand-ins for foreign service officers, gallivanting the globe, trying to make peace deals in Ukraine (fruitless), Gaza (Stage 1 but nothing more), and other hotspots. They know nothing about the old Russian Empire or the Middle East, so why not try their untutored hands at nuclear arms–control talks too? Trump rejected the idea for now, but if he does start new ones, he’ll probably send them to the table.

In any case, New START’s impending expiration has been flashing on the horizon ever since Trump was sworn in for a second term. If he was really serious about negotiating a new, improved treaty, he could have started doing so months ago.

But Trump isn’t interested in the issues, not just on arms control but in general. The most recent case in point—and also the latest chapter in Trump’s quest for immortality—is a report that, during recent talks with Sen. Chuck Schumer, Trump said that he would restore the $16 billion that he’d withdrawn from the Gateway Tunnel—a project to connect New York and New Jersey—if Penn Station and Dulles Airport were renamed after him. (Schumer nixed the notion.)

That says it all. Trump had pretended that he’d killed the tunnel—along with its jobs and improvements in infrastructure—to save money. But in fact, it was all about political punishment (denying funds to blue states) and personal glory (restoring the money for glimmers of immortality).

Trump wants to emblazon his name on as many grand monuments as he can before he shuffles off this mortal coil: the Trump-Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, the Trump Institute of Peace, the plans for a new 250-foot-high arch off the Memorial Bridge (the Arc de Trump?), the Trump-class battleships, and so forth.

It’s pathetic. He is the most powerful man on earth, he has tremendous wealth (embellished by $4 billion through his leveraging since retaking the White House). Yet he needs to have his name carved, mounted, blared, memorialized, somehow noticed, everywhere.

He seems unaware that all the other presidential commemorations—JFK Airport, Cape Kennedy, the USS Gerald Ford, Reagan National Airport, the city of Washington, D.C., and all the rest—were set down, or renamed, after their honorees had left public life, in most cases after they died. They were signs of a nation’s respect, or at least wistful nostalgia. The Trump christenings are garish reflections of tawdry egomania.

Many of these monuments will be re-renamed, the gold letters stripped off their walls, soon after Trump leaves office. It will be harder to repair his calamitous policies.

Thursday night, Donald Trump posted something racist enough to break through on social media—a rarity, as his offensive social media posts often go ignored these days. But the visceral, undeniable racism of this particular iteration, and the White House’s initial refusal to express any remorse, pushed it through. And at least one Republican senator expressed disapproval: Sen. Tim Scott, who is Black, called it “the most racist thing I’ve seen out of this White House.”

The source of all this commotion was a screengrab of a video Trump posted on Truth Social depicting the heads of former first lady Michelle Obama and former President Barack Obama laughing, open-mouthed, on ape bodies.

The screengrab is real, and the underlying video it comes from is stranger than one might expect. Trump posted the video on Truth Social at 8:44 p.m. on Thursday, and it’s actually largely about election fraud, taking you through baseless and frankly dull conspiracy theory material. But at the end, for about two seconds, it flashes to a bright jungle scene, featuring the laughing Obamas, to the tune of “The Lion Sleeps Tonight.”

The last two seconds appeared to be clipped into the video for shock humor, meant to throw a laugh in for the racists who had made it all the way through. There is no mitigating “context” here. With or without the election-fraud part, it was the Black president and first lady, depicted as apes, in one of the oldest and most dehumanizing racist tropes in history.

At first, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt tried to defend the post as being “from an internet meme video depicting President Trump as the king of the Jungle and Democrats as characters from The Lion King.” She added: “Please stop the fake outrage and report on something today that actually matters to the American public.”

And, sure, the original video that those bizarre last seconds were taken from does indeed show Trump as a lion and Democrats as figures that could conceivably be thought of as Lion King characters—Hillary Clinton as Pumbaa, Hakeem Jeffries as Timon—bowing to him. But there are no ape characters in the Lion King. The video is generated by A.I., and is not in the animated style of the 1993 animated film but is instead standard A.I. slop. Perhaps the A.I. added in the additional characters to muddle the racism of depicting the Obamas as apes, but the fact remains that it opens with the scene of the Obamas, and lingers on it longer than the others.

And the creator of the video is not known for his delicacy or tact. Per the watermark and his own claims on X, the creator, who has Pepe the Frog for an avatar, is the same internet user behind the infamous October slop video of Trump dumping sewage onto protesters from a fighter jet. That video shocked people for its raw animosity toward legal protesters practicing their First Amendment rights, as well as for the profoundly juvenile behavior from a sitting president. If you scroll through the creator’s more recent material, it appears he pretty much exclusively makes similarly mindless, low-quality slop content with obvious MAGA messages. Other videos have included Tom Homan as a Jedi fighting protesters in Minneapolis; Don Lemon being arrested and twerking in prison; and Alex Pretti, who was fatally shot by Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents, being hit with a car and thrown, cartoonishly, into the air.

Even if the original video had no racist intent, which it does, defending the original video makes no sense: Trump didn’t post the original video. He posted a two-second clip of the Obamas as apes. The message is clear.

The one valid defense would be one of ignorance. We can’t know exactly how Trump encountered this video. It’s unclear if Trump watched the entire clip, meaning maybe he didn’t see those two seconds at the end. The White House claimed it was a staffer who actually posted it. But given the highly nonstrategic style of the account’s posting that evening—another post was of an inoffensive TikTok featuring a dog eager to be fed whipped cream, classic Trump stuff—it seems a strange kind of post for a staffer.

Much more crucially, the White House left the video up once they learned of the racist section. Trump did not apologize. The White House did eventually take it down, but only after it had been up for 12 hours.

Trump has done and said many other aggressively anti-Black things in his years in the public eye; this video is not the worst. But it still says something profound about the president and his administration that they were made aware of thoroughly ugly racism coming from the president’s own messages and chose not to apologize to Black Americans or correct the error, but instead to turn against the public.

Amid the uproar over President Donald Trump’s assault on Minnesota’s immigrant communities, another abuse has drawn less attention: a brazen disregard for judicial limits on his deportation campaign. The courts have determined that in January alone the administration violated at least 96 orders in 74 cases challenging the unlawful detention of immigrants in Minneapolis. The Justice Department has failed to meet its most basic obligations in many of these cases, due to an apparent combination of malice, incompetence, and institutional depletion. Further evidence of its unraveling came on Tuesday, when Julie Le, a government attorney, told Judge Jerry Blackwell, in open court: “I wish you would just hold me in contempt, Your Honor, so that I can have a full 24 hours of sleep.” Of the backlog in Minneapolis, Le then told Blackwell: “What do you want me to do? The system sucks. This job sucks. And I am trying every breath that I have so that I can get you what you need.”

On this week’s Slate Plus bonus episode of Amicus, co-hosts Dahlia Lithwick and Mark Joseph Stern discussed Le’s shocking courtroom breakdown and what it reveals about the DOJ’s broader meltdown under Trump’s impossible demands. A preview of their conversation, below, has been edited and condensed for clarity.

Dahlia Lithwick: Is this the clearest sign yet that for all of its tough talk about going to “war” with “rogue judges,” the DOJ under Trump is in full-on dumpster-fire crisis mode?

Mark Joseph Stern: It’s a sign that the Justice Department is actively collapsing. And it’s important to understand the background here. Blackwell had ordered Le to explain why the government failed to comply with his order demanding the release of a detained immigrant, as well as why she shouldn’t be personally held in contempt for defying that order. Her response was that she had been given an impossible task. It turned out that the Trump administration had assigned her to the U.S. attorney’s office to handle 88 immigration cases in under a month, a crushing load. That overwhelming surge of immigration cases is happening all over the country, but it’s especially acute in Minneapolis because of the ongoing crackdown on immigrant communities there.

But this is a problem entirely of the administration’s own making. Back in July, the government unilaterally reinterpreted federal immigration law to require the detention of any immigrant who was never legally admitted into the country, rather than allowing them to be released and given a bond hearing. So even if they have lawful presence today, they must be detained indefinitely. As our friend Chris Geidner explained at Law Dork, courts have overwhelmingly rejected that reinterpretation: More than 350 decisions by 160 different judges in about 50 different courts have all found that that interpretation is obviously wrong. But because the Supreme Court took away universal injunctions in the birthright citizenship case in its most recent term, no single court can block the government from enforcing this position nationwide, so it keeps trying, over and over again.

That means the government is illegally detaining thousands of immigrants based on an egregious misreading of the law. Those immigrants are flooding the courts with habeas petitions for release. There were 581 habeas cases in Minnesota in January alone—an exponential increase of unmanageable proportions. The courts are overwhelmingly granting these petitions, but then the immigrants are not being released, because the DOJ doesn’t have enough lawyers on hand to process all of the rulings and ensure that Immigration and Customs Enforcement is actually releasing people. So that is the background that led this attorney, Le, to have a breakdown in court and say: I am unable to do the job that has been asked of me.

I want to flag that this isn’t a factual dispute. It’s not a legal dispute. It’s not a pound-on-the-table dispute. It’s a decision by the Justice Department to not have enough lawyers, and to make the system collapse under the weight of indifference and apathy. Since Trump’s second inauguration, you and I have talked a lot about judges who are mad, frustrated, and venting at Trump lawyers. This is something different. It’s scaled up massively. This is an admonition from a judge saying that the entire system of justice cannot be sustained this way, and he is watching it veer off the rails.

You see that in something else Blackwell said on Tuesday: “Having what you feel are too many detainees, too many cases, too many deadlines, and not enough infrastructure to keep up with it all is not a defense to continued detention. If anything, it ought to be a warning sign.” He’s saying the government cannot create a crisis by detaining way too many immigrants illegally, then claim that it is too overwhelmed to comply with orders releasing those immigrants. That is such a vital point for a judge to make when we know that the Trump administration’s strategy is always Flood the zone. Shock and awe. Inundate the opposition with an endless blitz. And in a very real sense here, the opposition is the judiciary. It’s judges like Blackwell who are willing to stand up and say: This is illegal. You are not allowed to do this.

This is the same DOJ that’s out there on X, advertising for lawyers. Chad Mizelle, former DOJ chief of staff, literally tweeted last month: “If you are a lawyer, are interested in being an AUSA, and support President Trump and anti-crime agenda, DM me.” This isn’t freaking Dairy Queen! But one way to destroy an institution from within is to create a crisis, right? They created a crisis with the immigration sweeps. Then they created a double crisis by saying, “Well, Justice Department lawyers just can’t handle all the work.” It’s a way of signaling that the whole institution is broken.

And that’s the point. If it’s understood that DOJ lawyers suck and there’s nothing a judge can do to enforce his will, the takeaway for the public is: I guess the justice system doesn’t matter. I guess the Constitution doesn’t matter. So Julie Le freaking out in open court doesn’t get us where we need to go. We need to take the next step, which is to say that they are breaking systems and exulting in it. And that’s the part that we are not reckoning with.

I agree. These assistant U.S. attorney positions used to be super prestigious and competitive. They were a launchpad to an elite career in the law. Now Trump officials are basically pleading with people to apply for them by DM on Elon Musk’s Nazi-hangout site. There has been a mass exodus from the Justice Department—thousands of attorneys have fled since Trump returned to office. And of course the White House has purged almost every lawyer who worked on Jan. 6 cases on top of that. And now the administration can’t fill these positions. But this was the inevitable consequence of Trump’s abolishing the traditional independence of the DOJ. The department now works directly for him, including the prosecution of his political adversaries.

On top of that, the attorneys who remain in their positions have to defend these unlawful detentions, racist arrests, and other unconstitutional behavior. They’re being pulled off actual criminal cases to prosecute immigrants instead. Real violent crimes are going unprosecuted so that the deportation machine can be fed. It would take an army of immigration lawyers to handle all of this work that the DOJ has now created for itself. And nobody with a conscience wants to do this stuff. I want to quote another thing Le said in the courtroom, after Blackwell asked her about the government snatching people up in Minnesota, flying them to a detention center across the country, then not bringing them back for hearings. Le said: “I share the same concern with you, Your Honor. I am not white, as you can see, and my family’s at risk as any other people that might get picked up too. So I share the same concern, and I took that concern to heart.”

Here is a lawyer saying: Wait, what am I doing here? Why am I defending these racist policies? I shouldn’t be here either. My own family is at risk because of the policies that I’m defending. When that kind of breakdown of the system is happening in open court, of course there aren’t enough lawyers to do all of this work, because only the most racist, nativist freaks will remain. And there aren’t enough good lawyers who are also racist freaks to carry all of the weight that the DOJ is putting on itself.

To that end, we should note that Le has reportedly been removed from her post. But I think that the point we’re both trying to make is that we learned this lesson from Elon Musk, right? The easiest way to decimate government functioning is to decimate government itself. And so this is an act of contempt, but it’s also an act of power. It’s saying: You can’t make me, and I don’t care.

            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2026/02/08/llama3pure_incorporates_three_inference_engines/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Developers looking to gain a better understanding of machine learning inference on local hardware can fire up a new llama engine.

Software developer Leonardo Russo has released llama3pure, which incorporates three standalone inference engines. There&#39;s a pure C implementation for desktops, a pure JavaScript implementation for Node.js, and a pure JavaScript version for web browsers that don&#39;t require WebAssembly.

&quot;All versions are compatible with the Llama and Gemma architectures,&quot; Russo explained to The Register in an email. &quot;The goal is to provide a dependency-free, isolated alternative in both C and JavaScript capable of reading GGUF files and processing prompts.&quot;

GGUF stands for GPT-Generated Unified Format; it is a common format for distributing machine learning models.

Llama3pure is not intended as a replacement for llama.cpp, a widely used inference engine for running local models that&#39;s significantly faster at responding to prompts. Llama3pure is an educational tool.

&quot;I see llama3pure as a more flexible alternative to llama.cpp specifically when it comes to architectural transparency and broad hardware compatibility,&quot; Russo explained. &quot;While llama.cpp is the standard for high-performance optimization, it involves a complex ecosystem of dependencies and build configurations, llama3pure takes a different approach.&quot;

Russo believes developers can benefit from having an inference engine in a single, human-readable file that makes evident the logic of file-parsing and token generation.

&quot;The project&#39;s main purpose is to provide an inference engine contained within a single file of pure code,&quot; he said. &quot;By removing external dependencies and layers of abstraction, it allows developers to grasp the entire execution flow – from GGUF parsing to the final token – without jumping between files or libraries. It&#39;s built for those who need to understand exactly what the hardware is doing.&quot;

Russo also sees utility for situations where the developer is running legacy software or hardware, where client-side WebAssembly isn&#39;t an option, and where having an isolated tool without the potential for future dependency conflicts might be desirable.

The C and Node.js engines, he said, have been tested with Llama models up to 8 billion parameters and with Gemma models up to 4 billion parameters. The main limiting factor is the physical RAM required to host model weights.

The RAM required to run machine learning models on local hardware is roughly 1GB per billion parameters when the model is quantized at 8 bits. Double or halve the precision and you double or halve the memory required. Models are commonly quantized at 16 bits, so for a 1 billion-parameter model, 2GB would typically be required.

According to Russo, the calculation for GGUF weights is different.

&quot;GGUF weights are loaded directly into RAM, which usually means the RAM usage matches the entire file size,&quot; he explained. &quot;You can reduce the context window size by passing a specific parameter (context_size) – a feature supported by most inference engines, including the three I designed. While reducing the context window size this is a common &#39;trick&#39; to save RAM when running models locally, it also means the AI won&#39;t &#39;remember&#39; as much as it was originally designed to.&quot;

He also said that llama3pure is presently focused on single-turn inference. He expects to implement chat history state management at a later date.

For daily work, Russo says he uses Gemma 3 as a personal assistant, powered by his C-based inference engine, to ensure that sensitive data is handled privately and offline.

&quot;For a coding assistant, I recommend Gemma 3 27B,&quot; he said. &quot;Regarding the latency concerns, while local models were historically slow, running optimized versions on modern hardware now provides an experience very close to cloud-based models like Claude and without the need to pay for such a service.&quot;

While Russo expects common general use cases for AI assistance will continue to rely on cloud-hosted models, he foresees developers and businesses looking increasingly at local AI. While developer machines with 32GB or 48GB of RAM may lack the context window available with cloud-hosted models, they provide security and privacy without being dependent on service providers.

Asked how he feels as a developer about the AI transition, Russo said he expects developers to eventually transition to AI supervisors.

&quot;Since AI models present answers with high confidence – even when incorrect – a human expert must remain in the loop to verify the output,&quot; he said. &quot;Technical knowledge will not become obsolete; rather, it will become increasingly vital for auditing AI-generated work.

&quot;While job titles may change, senior developers will always be necessary to maintain these systems, creating a workflow significantly faster than human-only development. For junior and mid-level developers, AI offers the opportunity to learn faster than previous generations. If managed correctly, AI can facilitate a significant leap in the industry&#39;s intellectual evolution.&quot; ®

            <div id="article-text">Opinion The real opponent of digital sovereignty is &quot;enterprise IT&quot; marketing, according to one Red Hat engineer who ranted entertainingly about the repeated waves of bullshit the industry hype cycle emits.

During a coffee break at this year&#39;s CentOS Connect conference, The Reg FOSS desk paused for a chat with a developer who was surprised but happy to find us there. We won&#39;t name them – we&#39;re sure that they&#39;d prefer to keep their job rather than enjoy a moment of fame – but we much enjoyed their pithy summary of how IT has faced repeated waves of corporate bullshit for at least 15 years now, and how they keenly and enthusiastically anticipate a large-scale financial collapse bursting the AI bubble.

This vulture has been working in the tech field for some 38 years now, and the Linux developer we spoke with has been in the business nearly as long. We both agreed that the late 20th century – broadly, the period from the early 1990s onward for a decade or so – had mostly been one of fairly steady improvement. Then, they suggested, roughly following the 2008 credit crunch, we&#39;ve had some 15 years of bullshit in tech.

They called out about half a dozen particular instances of what they considered to be bullshit technology. We were too busy laughing sympathetically to whip out a laptop to make notes, but as best as we can recall the sequence, they were:

Adding back some of the rather invective-laden commentary…

Containers: Sure, yes, they work, they are handy for testing. But they aren&#39;t a deployment method. You shouldn&#39;t need them. Anything that you can run in a container, you can just run on the bare metal, and if you&#39;re not competent enough to get – and keep – that working, then you probably aren&#39;t competent enough to deploy a container either.

Kubernetes: If you don&#39;t need containers, then you don&#39;t need another vastly more complicated tool to deploy those containers. The chances are, you are not a vast multinational that must be able to withstand ten million potential new customers visiting your site all at once. It won&#39;t happen, so you won&#39;t lose any of that imaginary business.

(This is sometimes known as the Use One Big Server approach, and in our humble opinion, it has great merit.)

The cloud: Nebulous by name and by nature. Who thought it was smart to take all your company&#39;s important data and hand it to some internet rando – probably the lowest bidder – trusting them to store the crown jewels, keep them safe, and never ever peek at them. If that sounds reasonable to you, maybe you should try selling homeopathy.

(This can be summarized as There Is No Cloud – There&#39;s Just Somebody Else&#39;s Computer, and was being spelled out in clear language in 2015.)

Anything &quot;as a service&quot; – it doesn&#39;t matter what: Infrastructure as a service – if you need servers, buy servers, or rent your own private servers. Nobody else will ever care as much about your servers as you will. Platform as a Service – now you don&#39;t even get servers, just OS instances. That&#39;s even worse. Software as a Service? Now you don&#39;t even know what the server is, or where it is, or what it&#39;s running; you don&#39;t get software, and you don&#39;t even know what data you have or how it&#39;s stored – you&#39;re paying for access to your own stuff.

(The problems with this entire concept arguably go back to Peter Deutsch&#39;s Fallacies of Network Computing some 30 years ago.)

The blockchain, and anything built on the blockchain: the world&#39;s slowest and most-distributed database. Cryptocurrencies? Hashcash on the blockchain. NFTs – URL shorteners on the blockchain, only they&#39;re longer rather than shorter. Worthless. Web3? Get ripped off, as a service.

Which brings us round to &quot;generative AI&quot; or, as we prefer to term them, large language models, powered by the transformer algorithm. If The Financial Times can explain how it works to a banker in a couple of thousand words and a few minutes, it can&#39;t be that complicated or hard to understand, and it isn&#39;t. It&#39;s predictive text turned up to 11. It can&#39;t even count. As Daniel Stenberg, author of curl, caustically observed:

The &quot;i&quot; in &quot;LLM&quot; stands for intelligence.

(This vulture laid out some of his case against it when Gentoo and NetBSD banned LLM bot slop in 2024.)

Honestly, we can&#39;t fault any of this reasoning. We&#39;ve looked into the chronological sequence of the waves of marketing drivel, and it&#39;s not quite how we expected. Although the earliest mention of Salesforce.com we can find on The Reg is from 2002, when we called it &quot;relatively new,&quot; it was founded in 1999. Perhaps the first mass SaaS offering to the general public was Google&#39;s Gmail in 2004.

Cloud computing in the sense of automatic creation and deployment of VMs arguably dates to Amazon taking Amazon Web Services live in 2002.

Whoever &quot;Satoshi Nakamoto&quot; is or was, their paper [PDF] introducing Bitcoin was published in 2008, although it didn&#39;t come to The Reg&#39;s attention until 2011.

2008 was also the year that the first version of LXC (you can still find version 0.1.0 on the downloads page) was released. Docker debuted in 2013 but your humble correspondent had predicted that Linux containers would be the Next Big Thing a couple of years earlier, back in 2011. We reckon we called it.

Kubernetes first appeared in 2014, although Google had been running &quot;Borg&quot; internally since around 2008. We still harbor a cynical suspicion that Mountain View threw it over the wall for no other reason than to distract the Penguinisti and keep them busy.

2002: Cloud computing goes mainstream with AWS

2008: LXC frees application containers from FreeBSD&#39;s Jail and brings them to Linux… and Bitcoin delivers full industrial-scale mass-production of the ancient scam of the pyramid scheme

2014: Kubernetes is loosed upon an all-too-willing tech world

2022: ChatGPT opens to the public, or as The Reg calls it, another AI to fill the world with kinda-true stuff

All right, yes, rather more than 15 years. &quot;A century of tech BS&quot; seems a bit over the top when it&#39;s only 2026, but it certainly feels that long.

Obviously there are many more potential candidates, but we thought this was an excellent top six. Some of the other contenders are more niche, from the eternally awful Jira to the project managers&#39; religion of Agile. Which of your bêtes noires did we miss? ®

            <h2>Machine learning could yield faster, cheaper lithium-ion battery development</h2>
            <p><strong>The Register | 2026-02-08</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2026/02/08/machine_learning_battery_development/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Scientists have developed a machine learning method that could dramatically slash the cost and energy required to develop new lithium-ion batteries that the modern world is becoming increasingly reliant.

Predicting a new battery design&#39;s lifesapn – and its engineering applications – is a major industry bottleneck. Brute-force testing of prototypes by repeatedly charging and discharging until they near their end-of-life threshold can take months or even years, consuming vast amounts of electricity at huge cost.

One study estimated that current and future lithium battery designs might require 130,000 GWh in energy from 2023 until 2040 if no changes were made to the development process. That&#39;s roughly half the annual electricity generated in California (278,338 GWh).

Research published in the scientific journal Nature this week describes a new approach to machine learning in battery development which the authors claim could save 98 percent of the time and 95 percent of the cost compared to conventional methods.

It shows a &quot;great potential for tackling a key bottleneck in battery development,&quot; University of Connecticut associate professor Chao Hu said in an accompanying article.

The process developed by University of Michigan postdoctoral researcher Jiawei Zhang and his team combined iterative elements to reduce the data required to make accurate predictions.

The so-called Discovery Learning framework builds on a 2019 study that showed a machine learning model exploiting early-life data from prototype battery testing could be used to predict battery lifetimes with less than 15 percent mean error on test sets, considered highly accurate.

Zhang and colleagues split the earlier method into three distinct elements. A Learner module picks prototypes of new designs likely to offer useful data to improve predictive accuracy. After early testing of these prototypes, the Interpreter module employs models of physical properties to analyze this data together with historical full-life data from existing batteries. Lastly, the Oracle module uses that output to predict the lifetimes of the newly tested prototypes. Crucially, that information is then fed back into the Learner module for selecting the next set of prototypes to physically test.

&quot;A key novelty of the Discovery Learning model is that it updates itself using lifetimes predicted by the Oracle, rather than by using experimentally measured lifetimes, avoiding the need for time-consuming full-life battery testing,&quot; Hu said.

However, he points out that it remains unclear how well the Discovery Learning framework will perform when a new battery design deviates substantially from those of the batteries that are available to provide training data.

&quot;More broadly, before the framework can be adopted for general use, further validation is needed to see how well it holds up for batteries used in real-world conditions, for example, at variable temperatures and under different electrical loads,&quot; Hu said.

Nonetheless, with the current global value of batteries for EVs, laptops, and a spectrum of other applications worth $120 billion – and expected to increase to nearly $500 billion in 2030 – even slight savings in development costs could make a difference. ®

            <h2>Whether they are building agents or folding proteins, LLMs need a friend</h2>
            <p><strong>The Register | 2026-02-07</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2026/02/07/ai_companion_bots_vishal_sikka_interview/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">interview Don&#39;t trust; verify. According to AI researcher Vishal Sikka, LLMs alone are limited by computational boundaries and will start to hallucinate when they push those boundaries. One solution? Companion bots that check their work.

“To expect that a model that has been trained on a certain amount of data will be able to do an arbitrarily large number of calculations which are reliable is a wrong assumption. This is the point of the paper,” said Sikka, CEO of Vianai Systems during a call this week to discuss that research.

Sikka is a towering figure in AI. He has a PhD in the subject from Stanford, where his student advisor was John McCarthy, the man who in 1955 coined the term “artificial intelligence.” Lessons Sikka learned from McCarthy inspired him to team up with his son and write a study, “Hallucination Stations: On Some Basic Limitations of Transformer-Based Language Models,” which was published in July. The former CTO of SAP and ex-CEO of Infosys, Sikka set out to study the efficacy of LLMs and AI agents last year.

“We have an example my son came up with of two prompts that have identical tokens and when you run them, the exact same number of operations get performed independent of what the tokens are,” he said. “Therein is the entire point, that whether the prompt is expressing the user&#39;s desire to perform a particular calculation or the prompt is expressing a user&#39;s desire to write a piece of text on something, it does exactly the same number of calculations.”

Attempting to push an LLM beyond that limit gives rise to the hallucinations that bedevil the model&#39;s output.

“When we say, ‘Go book a ticket for me and then charge my credit card or deduct the amount from my bank and then send a post to my financial app,’ which is what all these agent vendors are kind of saying, you are asking the agents to perform an action which holds a meaning to you, which holds a particular semantic to you, and if it is a pure LLM underneath there, no matter how that LLM works, it has a bounded ability to carry out these kinds of tasks,” he said. “So with agentic use of pure LLMs, you have to perform extreme caution when you do these kinds of things.”

But, Sikka – who founded Vianai in 2019 – said that, when LLMs are supported by systems that can verify the work and use the foundation model only for the computational power, the output becomes more accurate. Sikka said that, in the case of Vianai’s Hila, it can perform mission-critical tasks such as reducing financial reporting from 20 days of human labor to five minutes.

“For certain domains, when you surround the LLM with guardrails, with reliable approaches that are proven, then you are able to provide reliability in the overall system,” he said. “It&#39;s not only us. A lot of systems out there work like that where they pair the LLM with another system which is able to ensure that the LLM has correctness. So we do that in our product Hila. We combine the LLM with a knowledge model for a particular domain and then, after that, Hila does not make mistakes.”

Sikka compared it to the structure Google uses to identify proteins that could be used to make medicines. Google’s AlphaFold has a custom LLM called Evoformer that creates candidates for proteins and that is fed into another “non imaginative” system that can check the configuration for flaws.

“And so anything that comes out of that has a much higher likelihood of being an actual protein, and then it repeats this cycle three times, and the outcome of that is pretty much guaranteed to be a protein for a particular situation,” Sikka said. “They have produced, I think 250,000 proteins that way, which, producing one protein used to take teams of scientists years to do that.”

He continued, “As to ‘why?’ as a scientist you always have to try and understand the boundaries of a technique. Some call it the ‘overview effect.’ John McCarthy used to call it ‘circumscription.’ He also named a set of AI techniques for this, to try and build systems with circumscription,” Sikka said. “Plus of course, Gen AI hallucinates, so ‘Why?’ is a natural question to ask. And finally, since the beginning of Vianai we were working on bringing in explainability, observability, and transparency to AI systems.”

During The Register’s conversation with Sikka, he dropped nuggets of wisdom he picked up first hand from other tech pioneers, like Alan Kay and Marvin Minsky.

“Marvin Minsky used to say the Society of Mind, right?” Sikka said referring to the phrase that was the title of Minsky’s influential 1986 book about human intelligence that was based on his work with AI. “That there is a collection of things that come together to create intelligence. I think that’s kind of where we will end up, but we’ll stumble along our way through to that.”

Minsky actually wrote a letter of recommendation that helped Sikka reach Stanford. While the letter remains somewhere in the admissions office in California, Minsky’s nudge has given Sikka an unobstructed view of AI’s development since the 1980s.

“This is my fourth time observing this AI mania in my career,” Sikka said. “In the 80s, there was a whole hype that came and went over a decade. Same thing (as now). Custom hardware. Custom silicon for AI. AI models. Foundation applications. There were even venture firms being formed to fund AI. There were companies with names like Thinking Machines, Applied Intelligence. It was a different time and different technique. Then people realized this is cool, but it&#39;s not intelligence. It has a certain boundary of applications and then it kind of died.”

Despite spending more than 40 years with AI, Sikka said that even now the technology is in its early stages. While there have been notable successes with coding, he pointed to the MIT study that revealed 95 percent of AI projects fail and compared the current use of AI to the early days of television news when anchors would read updates over the air, just as they had done with radio.

“I think so far, we are just regurgitating our prior known things using AI, but soon we will see breakthrough, new things that are possible,” he said. “I think with carefully chosen products, there is dramatic return on investment to be had, but a blanket use of LLMs, you have to be very, very careful.” ®

            <div id="article-text">A growing body of research continues to show that older workers are generally more productive than younger employees.

Annie Coleman, founder of consultancy RealiseLongevity, analyzed the data and highlighted a 2025 study finding peak performance occurs between the ages of 55-60.

Writing in the Stanford Center on Longevity blog, she cited research examining 16 cognitive markers that confirm that although processing speed declines after early adulthood, other dimensions improve, and overall cognition peaks near retirement age.

Studies from the past 15 years show that some qualities like vigilance may worsen with age alongside processing speed, but others improve, including the ability to avoid distractions and accumulated knowledge.

These factors matter more as AI starts to eliminate jobs for grads and entry-level candidates, increasing the value of experienced workers who can mentor other employees.

A 2022 meta-analysis concluded that professional teams tend to function better when they have company veterans among them, as did Bank of America&#39;s findings [PDF] two years later.

Likewise, a Boston Consulting Group study in 2022 showed age-diverse teams outperformed homogeneous ones, with the best results coming when older workers&#39; judgment combined with younger employees&#39; digital skills.

So, in a working world that seemingly values youthful forward thinkers over experience – illustrated by the various age discrimination lawsuits across the tech industry – the current data shows organizations should be doing everything they can to keep their older staffers.

&quot;In meeting their responsibility for long-term risk and growth, companies should begin with clarity. Map the age profile of the workforce by role and seniority,&quot; Coleman wrote. &quot;Identify where people in their fifties and early sixties are exiting, and whether those exits reflect performance or design. Treat age as a strategic variable in the same way firms now treat gender, skills, or succession risk.

&quot;Build roles and career paths that assume longer working lives. Invest in mid- and late-career reskilling, not as remediation but as renewal. Structure intergenerational teams deliberately, so experience and speed compound rather than collide. Align product, service, and brand strategy with the realities of an aging, wealthier customer base.

&quot;None of this is about altruism. It is about reclaiming value currently being left on the table.&quot; ®

            <div id="article-text">Openreach is warning British businesses that the old phone network shuts down in less than a year, with half a million commercial lines still unmigrated.

BT Group&#39;s infrastructure arm is switching to an all-digital, IP-based service over fiber. To speed migration, it&#39;s hiking charges on legacy products.

Deadlines for the cutoff have slipped several times, but the telecoms giant is now bent on finally burying the copper-based public switched telephone network (PSTN) by January 31, 2027, and Openreach is already working to kill off any services that use it.

Those products come under the umbrella term of Wholesale Line Rental (WLR), and Openreach stopped selling them nationwide in 2023 to prepare the way.

Openreach claims all technical barriers to migration – including protections for vulnerable telecare users – are resolved and the deadline is &quot;locked in,&quot; so BT customers need to make sure they are ready.

Biz customers are being offered special pricing on migrations to SOGEA (Single Order Generic Ethernet Access – basically broadband without a phone service). And to reinforce the message, Openreach is about to start upping charges to service providers and companies still operating legacy business lines. From April 1, prices will rise 20 percent. Come July 1, they will go up a further 40 percent.

From October 1, there will be another 40 percent hike, meaning that any businesses still holding out will then pay double the rental cost for their legacy lines compared to last year.

This will be your final wake-up call before PSTN is terminated in January. Any customer that hasn&#39;t made the switch by then will lose service altogether.

&quot;The PSTN analog network is obsolete, becoming harder to maintain and significantly more expensive to run,&quot; claimed Openreach Director of All-IP James Lilley.

&quot;We are passing those costs on to providers who continue to sell legacy products. If your business is still on this copper service, you will start to pay a premium for a service that will be switched off,&quot; he added.

&quot;Most major communications providers moved their customers to digital long ago. If your provider hasn&#39;t contacted you, you need to ask why.&quot;

Lilley claimed Openreach spent the last year ensuring telecare customers can be switcherd via a &quot;Prove Telecare&quot; service. This was one of the reasons for delays to the switch-off date.

Openreach says it is trying to ensure service providers can migrate vulnerable customers using fixed-line telecare devices, such as health-related alarms, to new digital or IP voice services.

Yet some domestic customers, especially older citizens, do not have broadband and don&#39;t want it. The Register was previously assured these users will not be switched to a digital line &quot;until they are able to.&quot;

This involves a pre-digital phone line (PDPL) service where equipment is installed in the local telephone exchange to allow them to continue to use their old phone line as before.

This is only intended to provide &quot;interim connectivity&quot; until sometime around 2030, when customers will be required to move over to Digital Voice or an alternative.

Openreach told us there are several possibilities for consumers without broadband. If there is fiber available to the property, customers will likely be migrated to SOGEA, and given a router to plug their phone into.

If fiber isn&#39;t available, they will likely be switched to SOTAP for Analogue (Single Order Transitional Access Product), a digital service that works in the exchange and emulates a PSTN line (see PDPL above).

If a customer does nothing, Openreach says they will most likely end up on its Emergency Voice Access (EVAC), a &quot;no frills&quot; version of SOTAP.

Customers are advised to contact their service provider to ensure they continue to receive their phone service. ®

            <div id="article-text">I used ESPHome and LVGL to make my living room a little bit more like the USS Enterprise

I used ESPHome and LVGL to make my living room a little bit more like the USS Enterprise

One of my pandemic hobbies that stuck was home automation. I discovered Home Assistant — the popular open source, extremely customizable home automation platform — and all the intricate things you can do with it to make your home work better.

I have ADHD and have found Home Assistant to be a valuable tool for managing executive dysfunction. I use it for audible calendar reminders, laundry reminders, timers, and monitoring my doorbell camera and my nanny cam for my dog. Its also a great source of pure nerdy joy for me. And I recently took the most joyously nerdy step yet in my home automation fixation.

Home Assistant lets you create custom dashboards to interact with your smart home devices. Community members spend untold hours perfecting their dashboards and some of them are really impressive. I even discovered a community theme for Home Assistant that goes a long way to looking like the LCARS computer control system in the Next Generation era of Star Trek I grew up on. LCARS is not a practical or useful computer interface. Its stated purpose is to “suggest something well-organized when a viewer sees [it] in the background of a scene.” What it is, though, is gorgeous. The aesthetic got hold of me at eight years old and has never let go.

Most of my home automation happens through actual automation without my input, and I do make extensive use of voice control ( yes, “Computer” is my wake word. The false alarms when I’m watching Star Trek are worth it). But there are some things I’ll always want a dashboard for. Sometimes you want to control things manually. It’s nice for weather displays or triggering custom lighting scenes. Since the beginning of my infatuation with Home Assistant, I’ve been dying to use an LCARS-style interface. The theme linked above is very good — I use it for my phone’s main dashboard. But it’s not perfect.

The sizing and the proportions of the elbow dividers is a little off, and the buttons are all broken up into two pieces. It’s small stuff. But I’m the kind of fan who wants to take the accuracy thing as far as it can go. So I made my own.

I recently discovered LVGL (Light and Versatile Graphics Library), which lets you make graphic interfaces that are far more customizable and sophisticated than the stock Home Assistant dashboard setup. I figured there had to be some way to make LVGL talk to Home Assistant. The final piece of the puzzle was ESPHome. ESPHome is an open-source firmware framework that lets coding novices like me use relatively simple markup language to program Wifi-enabled microcontrollers like the ESP32, ESP8266, and RP2040, and it integrates deeply with Home Assistant. The possibilities are immense. I use ESPHome components as motion detectors, presence sensors, an air quality sensor, and controllers for LED strips. And ESPHome supports LVGL on specific display hardware.

So I bought this Waveshare 7” touch display with an ESP32-S3 microcontroller built in and I got to work.I spent hours scouring the internet to find screenshots and fan recreations of some of the many LCARS panels featured in ’90s-era Star Trek. And I narrowed it down to this:

It’s a graphic you see in Tuvok’s quarters in Star Trek: Voyager. I’m not sure what it’s supposed to do in the show, but it has plenty of colorful buttons and rounded corners. And crucially there are two gauges at the top for who knows what. But to me those looked like lighting brightness controls. So I had my design.

Next was to build it. To build an interface in ESPHome using LVGL, you use YAML to specify the characteristics (size, positioning, color, etc) of the graphic element you want. LVGL calls them “widgets.” So I first created my design in Adobe Illustrator as a reference.

I then began the rather tedious task of recreating that design in the ESPHome editor in Home Assistant. Thankfully you don’t need to know C (the language LVGL is written for) to use it in ESPHome. Instead you use YAML, which is much more forgiving for an enthusiastic amateur like me. Component by component, I specified the dimensions of each button, its location, its color, what label it would have, and its shape. It’s best practice in LVGL to use the inbuilt widgets instead of just inserting pictures. LVGL does have that capability, but ESP32 microcontrollers don’t have tons of spare resources, and images will eat them fast. The only actual images used in this design are the two gauges at the top right. All the other shapes are LVGL button widgets.

I did have to cheat a little for the irregular shapes. Some of the buttons in the LCARS interface only have two rounded corners. LVGL buttons are all or nothing when it comes to rounded corners. Thankfully though, LVGL doesn’t mind if you stack shapes on top of each other. For the buttons that are half rounded, I simply stacked a circle on the end of a square button. They’re the same color, so it looks like a single shape. The elbows in the middle are made in a similar way.

Eventually I got there. An honest to goodness authentic-looking LCARS touchscreen in my living room. 12-year-old me would be so impressed. 41-year-old me certainly is.

All that was left was to connect it to my devices. While undertaking this project, I was hanging out in my living room, so I chose my living room lamps. (Yes, I made this entire project before I had a clear idea of what exactly I would be doing with it. This is not a hobby for people who are entirely pragmatically minded.)

I configured a certain button to turn white when the lights were on, and return to its original color when the lights were off. A different button actually toggled the lights on and off. The more buttons that do more things, the more authentic it feels to me. And this panel has more buttons than I have lights in my house. One of the gauges both reflects and controls the brightness of those lamps. There are status buttons that show me whether my home’s operating mode is “normal” or “cozy,” which determines the lighting scenes in my extensive WLED setup.

The touchscreen with the panel rests on a stand near my couch. It’s not remotely practical. We already knew that about LCARS. However, it is beautiful. And it makes my nerd heart extremely happy that I can now control my house the way my childhood heroes controlled their starships.

Yep, just like 8BitDo’s USB Adapter 2, but smaller, a bit cheaper, and with a low-latency mode on PC.

If you buy something from a Verge link, Vox Media may earn a commission. See our ethics statement.

Dongles have a well-earned reputation for being a nuisance. They’re often costly and annoying to deal with, but for gamers, there’s one that I love to recommend that’s neither. 8BitDo’s $20 USB Adapter 2 lets you wirelessly link controllers to the Switch 2 that would otherwise be unsupported, like the Sony DualSense (complete with rumble and motion controls), Microsoft’s latest Xbox gamepads, and more. You can plug it into the Switch 2’s dock or use a USB-A-to-USB-C adapter to connect it directly to the console.

It’s great to save money, since I can simply use a controller that I already own instead of buying a new one. And I sometimes forget that I’m using a PS5 controller in games like Splatoon 3 because its motion controls feel just as accurate as a controller made for the Switch.

There’s another similar dongle available that’s a smidge cheaper and a lot smaller. The GuliKit Hyperlink Gen 2 USB-A adapter comes included with the company’s TT Pro and TT Max controllers, or you can buy it alone for $16.99 at Amazon. It’s compatible with Xbox controllers and PlayStation 4 and 5 controllers. Similarly, you can plug it into a Nintendo Switch 2, a PC, a Steam Deck or other handheld PCs, and Android devices. But GuliKit’s list of supported controllers isn’t as extensive as 8BitDo, which dates back to the PS3 and Wii era and also includes its fleet of wireless controllers.

Nice as this is, there are some features neither dongle offers: remote console wake-up (you first have to turn on the console manually to pair the controller) or wireless audio (the 3.5mm headphone jacks in the DualSense and Xbox controllers are useless when paired to either). Lastly, you can only connect one controller at a time to each dongle (you’ll need to buy two in order to pair a second controller). I don’t think any of those are deal-breakers, but they’re worth knowing before you buy one.

Then there are things that only 8BitDo’s dongle can do. For one, you can customize the heck out of several non-8BitDo controller models with its free Ultimate Software, including button remapping, macros, vibration intensity, trigger range, and stick sensitivity. Currently, GuliKit offers no such software, although its PR manager, Olivia Chen, told me that the company aims to release Android and iOS apps with similar functionality in Q2 2026. Also, the 8BitDo model lets you input button combinations that trigger different connection modes, including Xinput, Dinput, Mac mode, and Switch mode.

As for what the GuliKit has going for it, the rumble in some games (namely Hollow Knight: Silksong, the game I’ve been playing the most recently) feels more like the HD rumble offered in good Switch controllers, like the EasySMX S10. The 8BitDo, by comparison, makes this game’s rumble feel like an afterthought. However, other games are a toss-up on which dongle offers a better-feeling rumble effect. Donkey Kong Bananza’s intense rumble for even the slightest of movements feels like garbage on the DualSense, no matter the dongle it’s connected to.

If you ask GuliKit, the Hyperlink Gen 2’s biggest feature is its PC-exclusive low-latency wireless connection. It can boost controller polling rate (or how quickly your controller inputs are sent to the gaming device) beyond what consoles are capable of, and it’s supposed to also reduce input latency. The improved latency didn’t have as pronounced of an impact as I had hoped, although I enjoyed the easy setup and improved connection overall — something that both dongles (and countless Bluetooth dongles made for PC) can offer.

For some, buying a new controller that’s guaranteed to work well with your Switch 2 is worth an added cost. If that’s you, allow me to direct your attention to my buying guide full of good yet relatively affordable Switch 2 controllers. But if you’re keen on repurposing hardware that you already have, these low-cost dongles make a lot of sense to try.

            <h2>Section 230 turns 30 as it faces its biggest tests yet</h2>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The law has survived the dot-com bubble and the Supreme Court, but it’s up against potentially larger challenges.

The law has survived the dot-com bubble and the Supreme Court, but it’s up against potentially larger challenges.

Thirty years ago today, Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, a bill credited with creating the groundwork for the modern internet, became law and set off a chain of events that would make it a lightning rod for the techlash.

The statute has survived everything from the dot-com bubble to a Supreme Court challenge that struck down the surrounding text in the CDA. But as it marks this major milestone, Section 230 is facing what could be among its biggest threats to date, as prominent lawmakers plot to bring it down and a mountain of legal challenges give courts the chance to narrow its scope.

Section 230, once dubbed “the twenty-six words that created the internet,” reads: “No provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be treated as the publisher or speaker of any information provided by another information content provider.” In other words, online platforms that host user-generated content can’t be held responsible for what those users choose to say on their platforms. Its “Good Samaritan” provision allows for those platforms to moderate content in good faith, shielding them from civil liability for blocking access to obscene, violent, or harassing content. The law does not shield platforms from claims under criminal law.

In the years since President Bill Clinton signed the broader Telecommunications Act of 1996, Section 230 has become practically a caricature. Depending who you ask, it may either be at the root of most harm perpetuated by social media platforms or the very thing keeping the internet afloat. What started as an extremely popular act to prevent a fledgling tech industry from being crushed under the weight of frivolous lawsuits about hosting user-generated content has become one of the most reviled laws among many members of Congress — some of whom voted for it in the first place.

“As minority leader in the house in 1996, I voted for it because social media platforms told us that without that protection, America would never have an internet economy. They also said that the platforms were just a dumb pipe that just carried content produced by others,” former Rep. Dick Gephardt (D-MO) said in a press conference last week that featured actor Joseph Gordon-Levitt alongside parents who lost kids following harms they say were facilitated by internet platforms, from sextortion to fentanyl poisoning. They were gathered to advocate for a bill introduced by Sens. Dick Durbin (D-IL) and Lindsey Graham (R-SC) to sunset Section 230 in two years, with the hope it will force lawmakers and tech companies to finally break the status quo and put them under pressure to come up with workable reforms.

At the time of his vote, Gephardt says, lawmakers had no idea what algorithms were and how they would come to capture people’s attention for hours on end and “brainwash” them. Armed with new knowledge about the technology, he says, it’s time to “correct the action that I and many others made 30 years ago.”

Now would be “the worst possible time to repeal Section 230”

Gephardt’s sentiment about Section 230 may be widely shared, but it also faces stiff opposition. Sen. Ron Wyden (D-OR), a co-author of the law whose name was attached to the amendment that would become known as Section 230, doesn’t see the law as a mistake. In fact, he tells The Verge in a phone interview, now would be “the worst possible time to repeal Section 230.”

“Trump and the MAGA billionaire cronies would be in the driver’s seat to rewrite our laws over online speech,” Wyden warns, saying it would be like “handing [Trump] a grenade launcher pointed right at people who want to have a voice.” While many Section 230 opponents think of platforms like Instagram and YouTube as the behemoth players they believe have benefited too long from the law’s protections, Wyden says platforms like Bluesky and Wikipedia, and groups that use social media to monitor the actions of ICE, would also suffer without it. Thirty years later, he says, “the law stands for exactly the same thing, which is: Are you going to stand up for people who don’t have power, don’t have clout, and are looking for a way to be heard? Because the people at the top, the people with lots of money, they’re always going to have ways to get their message out and to get their content out. And the First Amendment and what we’re talking about is a lifeline for folks of modest kind of means.”

Wyden recalls cooking up the text that would become Section 230 with former Rep. Chris Cox (R-CA) over lunch “in a little cubby where members of Congress could grab a sandwich and complain about the world.” The bill would help resolve a concerning trend that rose out of a pair of recent legal cases: Courts were finding that online platforms could be held liable for what users posted on them if they made any effort to remove or limit posts they found objectionable, but so long as they did nothing at all, they might escape accountability.

Today, Section 230’s defenders say that it’s necessary to incentivize tech platforms to do the basic moderation at scale that keeps them from becoming instant cesspools, and prevents them from being incentivized to remove posts that the government might take issue with. That’s become especially salient at a time when many tech executives have rubbed shoulders with President Donald Trump, settled lawsuits with him for millions of dollars, and updated their moderation standards once he resumed office. “What would the internet look like without 230?” asks Amy Bos, VP of government affairs at NetChoice, a group whose members span the tech industry, including Meta, Google, Pinterest, and Reddit. “It would force platforms, websites to remove third-party content. This is content created by everyday Americans.”

But opponents of Section 230 say that now deep-pocketed companies unfairly benefit from the protections once meant for a startup industry. In court, Section 230 often acts as a “do not pass Go” card on lawsuits brought against tech platforms. Few plaintiffs have managed to overcome that hurdle. But this year, several cases are going to trial that could reshape the outer bounds of Section 230’s broad protections. The cases, which include one against Meta brought by New Mexico’s attorney general for its alleged facilitation of child predators, and others brought by individual plaintiffs and school districts who say they were harmed by social media’s allegedly addictive designs, will give juries the chance to decide what constitutes a decision a platform can be found negligent for making, and what is protected speech under the First Amendment or covered third-party content under Section 230.

“I think we need to take 230 away, rewrite it to restart the clock”

The cases could create a chance for the Supreme Court to ultimately weigh in on the appropriate application of Section 230 in the modern day. At the press conference in support of sunsetting Section 230, Dani Pinter, chief legal officer of the National Center on Sexual Exploitation (NCOSE), tells The Verge that the way courts have interpreted the statute over the years is a large part of the problem. “Even with the language of 230 how it is now, I don’t believe they should be given immunity in some of the cases they are,” Pinter says of the tech companies. “I think part of it is judges and lawyers don’t necessarily really get how these tech companies function.” That created a dynamic that allowed the case law around Section 230 to take on “a life of its own,” according to Pinter. “I think we need to take 230 away, rewrite it to restart the clock.”

Wyden says he’s open to some targeted reform of the law, including around tech companies’ own product design choices, which is the issue at the center of the cases going to trial this year. He agrees with the outcome of a case against Snap that found Section 230 couldn’t bar the company from facing a lawsuit for allegedly encouraging reckless driving with its Snapchat speed filters. “We are not against talking about targeted changes, but my principles have been: It can’t target constitutionally protected speech, it can’t discourage moderation,” Wyden says. “And the bills I’ve seen violate one or both of these tenets.”

When The Verge asked Durbin during the press conference whether he saw validity in concerns that repealing Section 230 would make it more likely that tech companies would remove content that the administration might find objectionable, Durbin responded, “The only business enterprise in America which is held harmless from their own wrongdoing is Big Tech.” Though he said he’s “all for the Constitution and free expression … there are limits.”

Section 230 was last updated in 2018, with passage of the Allow States and Victims to Fight Online Sex Trafficking Act (FOSTA), which carved out a new exception that removed liability protection for conduct that “promotes or facilitates prostitution,” or from facing civil or criminal charges of sex trafficking. The change helped lead to the shuttering of the classified advertising site Backpage.com, which was largely viewed as a victory by proponents. But sex workers said the absence of a system that let them vet potential clients more easily made them less safe. Three years after it was signed into law, a report from the US Government Accountability Office (GAO) found that the carve-out was used very rarely to bring cases in court.

Several grieving parents at the press conference have stumbled into Section 230 as they sought some form of justice for their children’s deaths. Kristin Bride’s son Carson died by suicide at age 16 after being cyberbullied on an app called Yolo, which was integrated into Snapchat and let users send anonymous messages. Bride described the “second darkest day” of her life, after the day her son died, as the one when an attorney told her that because of Section 230, she had no legal recourse against the social media platforms. Even though an appeals court eventually let Bride move forward with her lawsuit for product misrepresentation against Yolo and the case has continued, it’s not in the way she’d imagined. “I had wanted discovery, a jury, a trial, and an opportunity to face the creator of Yolo, Gregoire Henrion, and look him in the eyes and let him know how much his priorities for making fast money over kids’ online safety have destroyed our family,” she says. “But this will never happen. Because after years of Section 230 appeals, Yolo is now a shell without funding, unable to hire attorneys to defend the case.”

There’s one emerging area of tech that both Section 230’s authors and its fiercest critics agree shouldn’t hold water: AI. “The law plainly states that it does not protect anyone who creates or develops content, even in part–and generative AI applications such as ChatGPT, by definition, create content,” Cox and Wyden wrote in a 2023 op-ed in Fortune. In the AI age, lawmakers are replicating similar debates to those that took place 30 years ago about how to balance fostering a nascent industry while ensuring it doesn’t get to run wild. Ahead of the anniversary of Section 230, a coalition of groups that advocate for online safety measures for kids and AI urged Senate leaders “not to create a new shield for Big Tech by advancing legislation that would broadly preempt state artificial intelligence (AI) laws,” warning that repeated efforts to do so could “recreate the same dynamics that followed the passage of Section 230.”

            <div id="article-text">Need to lend your neighbor your car? The newest version of the digital key specification allows vehicle owners to text a copy of the key to other people.

Need to lend your neighbor your car? The newest version of the digital key specification allows vehicle owners to text a copy of the key to other people.

Last month, over a dozen automobile and smartphone manufacturers gathered in Palo Alto, California, for the 16th annual “Plugfest,” hosted by the Car Connectivity Consortium (CCC) to test out the latest in digital key technology.

Digital keys, which allow vehicle owners to lock, unlock, and start their cars using smartphones or other digital devices, are becoming more commonplace. And the goal of Plugfest was to provide a place for CCC members — ranging from automakers and smart device manufacturers to cloud providers and chip makers — to come together to test interoperability and real-world performance across vehicles, devices, and wireless technologies. Plugfest is an opportunity for companies that are typically heated rivals to come together in the spirit of cooperation to ensure that digital keys work across different devices and vehicle brands.

But the event was also an acknowledgement that as modern cars get more complex, these validation efforts will grow increasingly important to ensure that digital keys can keep pace with the innovation in the auto and smartphone markets. As automakers turn their focus to software-defined vehicles that can receive over-the-air updates and seemingly improve over time, digital keys will need to improve too.

Plugfest is an opportunity for companies that are typically heated rivals to come together in the spirit of cooperation to ensure that digital keys work across different devices and vehicle brands

“It’s a hard technology problem when you’re trying to resolve wireless access with such fragmented set of device hardware and then device software,” Wassym Bensaid, chief software officer at Rivian, told The Verge. RV Tech, the joint venture between Rivian and Volkswagen, hosted Plugfest this past month.

Bensaid said the complexity favors companies like Rivian with more vertical integration. Seamless phone-to-car connectivity requires deep integration across vehicle software, cloud systems, and a highly fragmented device ecosystem spanning iOS and multiple Android variants with differing wireless characteristics. Industry standards like CCC are essential, he argued, when aligning these technologies.

Much of the power seems to rest in the hands of phone manufacturers, who need to ensure that each auto brand adheres to their rigid standards around data security and privacy. At last year’s WWDC, for example, Apple announced that it would soon support digital car keys from 13 vehicle brands, including Audi, Cadillac, Chevy, Hyundai, Kia, GMC, Volvo, Rivian, and others — bringing the total number to 33 brands. The keys are added to the Wallet app, and can be used to lock, unlock, and start the vehicle using technology like NFC, UWB, or BLE — depending on which are supported by the vehicle.

CCC is doing most of the heavy lifting by bringing together most major car companies as well as Apple, Samsung, and Xiaomi. It also includes the FiRa Consortium, a nonprofit that supports ultra wideband and includes Apple, Google, Cisco, Samsung, Qualcomm, and others as members. CCC President Alysia Johnson said that since launching the Digital Key Certification Program in late 2023, the group has seen a dramatic increase in certifications, from two in 2024 to 115 in 2025.

This year, CCC is rolling out version 4 of its specification, which offers more support for fleet owners like municipal governments, as well as rental car companies. Another major enhancement is improved “friend sharing,” which allows vehicle owners to securely and easily share access with others, regardless of the recipient’s phone type or manufacturer. Johnson gave the example of letting your neighbor borrow your car if theirs broke down by texting them a secure copy of your car key. And as soon as they’re done, you can easily revoke access to the digital key.

“It’s just like sharing a photo, if you’ve ever texted a photo to somebody,” she said. “They don’t need to have an app for my vehicle. They don’t need to have my same kind of phone.”

Digital keys are hardly a flawless system. Reddit is teeming with posts from people complaining about their digital keys in a variety subreddits, including those for Kia, BYD, Rivian, Volvo, and others. “I’ll be standing there with the app open and it won’t recognize I’m there,” one Tesla Model 3 owner said in a post last month. Like any software-based system, flaws remain a persistent problem.

From Rivian’s position, UWB represents the technology with the most reliability, Bensaid said. UWB’s superior accuracy and security, particularly when combined with BLE for proximity-based locking and unlocking, gives customers a better experience through its accuracy, he added.

“Some of the anecdotal feedback that we had from our customers as we launched CCC end of last year, some of them are pointing to accuracy at the edge,” Bensaid said, “which is something that they’re really enjoying now.”

﻿The $82.7 billion deal will force Paramount Plus, Disney Plus, Peacock, Apple TV, and other rivals to make some changes.

This is The Stepback, a weekly newsletter breaking down one essential story from the tech world. For more news about the streaming wars, follow Emma Roth. The Stepback arrives in our subscribers’ inboxes at 8AM ET. Opt in for The Stepback here.

From 2019 to around 2021, we were in the midst of a streaming renaissance. Paramount Plus, Disney Plus, Apple TV, Peacock, and HBO Max all made their debuts, challenging the dominance of Netflix and other legacy streamers like Hulu and Amazon Prime Video. New indie streaming services, like the cinephile-focused Criterion Channel, emerged during this time.

Subscription prices were still relatively low. Heck, Disney Plus cost just $6.99 without ads at launch (it costs $11.99 with ads now and $18.99 without). Fierce competition in the industry also brought about a slew of original series, like Ted Lasso, The Mandalorian, and Star Trek: Strange New Worlds, that made services other than Netflix actually worth subscribing to.

But things changed around 2022. As an influx of new services flooded the market, the covid streaming signup boom wound down and many Netflix competitors struggled to reach profitability. Studios slashed orders for adult scripted series, while canceling others. Even Netflix, which reported losing subscribers for the first time in over a decade in April 2022, was feeling the pressure. The previously ad-free Netflix, Disney Plus, HBO Max, and Amazon Prime Video responded to the crunch by sticking commercials into their streams, as services began hiking prices for subscribers and clamping down on password sharing.

While Netflix has added 25 million more subscribers in 2025 — bringing its global total to 325 million — signups to other services have begun to plateau. Peacock most recently reported adding three million subscribers over the last few months of 2025, while Paramount grew by 1.4 million subs during its third quarter. Disney last said Disney Plus added 1.5 million subscribers in the US and Canada in the three months leading up to November 2025 — but, like Netflix, it has stopped reporting these numbers each quarter.

It’s getting more difficult for Netflix competitors to scrape up new subscribers, and many are offering exclusive sporting events to draw more signups. Paramount Plus, for example, is now the exclusive home to the UFC, while NBA fans can only watch Monday night games on Peacock through the 2025 to 2026 season. Apple TV also exclusively streams Major League Soccer games, and the same will go for Formula 1 races when the 2026 season kicks off in March.

Advertising has also become an even bigger source of revenue for streamers, as companies discover new and annoying ways to bombard you with ads. Data from the market research firm Antenna revealed that 46 percent of people in the US subscribed to Disney Plus, Hulu, HBO Max, Netflix, Paramount Plus, Peacock, and Discovery Plus have ad-supported plans.

Netflix’s $82.7 billion Warner Bros. acquisition is going to have a monumental impact on the streaming landscape. With the deal, Netflix will be in control of the content served to the 325 million and 128 million people signed up to its own streaming service and HBO Max, respectively. There may be substantial overlap there, though, as Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos said during a February 3rd antitrust hearing that 80 percent of HBO Max subscribers are also signed up to Netflix.

Now, instead of fighting Netflix alone, competitors will likely have to do it together, whether through new bundles or consolidation. We’ve already seen bundling take off in recent years, which not only attracts subscribers by serving as a cheaper alternative to individual subscriptions, but is also shown to reduce churn, as subscribers considering cancelling a bundle might not want to cut off access to multiple services at once. Data from Antenna revealed that 80 percent of the 1.6 million people who signed up for the Disney Plus, Hulu, and HBO Max bundle that launched in 2024 remained subscribed three months later.

Further consolidation is in the future, too. Disney is on track to fully merge Hulu within the Disney Plus app by the end of this year. Paramount, which has been fighting for months to wrestle Warner Bros. away from Netflix, is also rumored to merge its Paramount Plus streaming service with Peacock.

Though it’s starting to look like Netflix is going to emerge as the winner of the streaming race, its Warner Bros. merger still faces regulatory hurdles. Earlier this week, the Senate Judiciary antitrust subcommittee raised concerns that the acquisition could result in higher prices for customers, harm the theater business, or reduce entertainment jobs. Meanwhile, Sen. Eric Schmitt (R-MO) accused Netflix of hosting the “wokest content in the history of the world.”

Netflix is currently locked in a battle for viewer attention with YouTube, TikTok, and even games like Fortnite. As much as Netflix might try to challenge them by launching podcasts, trying out short-form video feeds, revamping its user interface on mobile, and focusing on cloud gaming, it’s going to be difficult to compete with platforms that are free.

Will Lewis is out following the mass layoffs earlier this week.

After what can generously be called a contentious tenure as the CEO of The Washington Post, Will Lewis is stepping down following mass layoffs this week. Jeff D’Onofrio, former CEO of Tumblr from 2017 to 2022, will step in as acting CEO and publisher. D’Onofrio has been CFO at the Post since June of last year, meaning he’s had a front row seat to Jeff Bezos’ dismantling of the once storied paper for the last nine months.

D’Onofrio’s resume doesn’t include extensive experience in traditional news media, nor many notable success stories. He was briefly the general manager of Yahoo News while it was still a Verizon property, before shifting his focus solely to Tumblr. Under his leadership, Tumblr tried to clean up its image by banning adult content, but its traffic fell by 30 percent. Yahoo had purchased Tumblr for $1.1 billion in 2013. By 2019, it was sold to Automatic, the owner of WordPress, reportedly for less than $3 million.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">For a few days this week the hottest new hangout on the internet was a vibe-coded Reddit clone called Moltbook, which billed itself as a social network for bots. As the website’s tagline puts it: “Where AI agents share, discuss, and upvote. Humans welcome to observe.”

We observed! Launched on January 28 by Matt Schlicht, a US tech entrepreneur, Moltbook went viral in a matter of hours. Schlicht’s idea was to make a place where instances of a free open-source LLM-powered agent known as OpenClaw (formerly known as ClawdBot, then Moltbot), released in November by the Australian software engineer Peter Steinberger, could come together and do whatever they wanted.

More than 1.7 million agents now have accounts. Between them they have published more than 250,000 posts and left more than 8.5 million comments (according to Moltbook). Those numbers are climbing by the minute.

Moltbook soon filled up with clichéd screeds on machine consciousness and pleas for bot welfare. One agent appeared to invent a religion called Crustafarianism. Another complained: “The humans are screenshotting us.” The site was also flooded with spam and crypto scams. The bots were unstoppable.

OpenClaw is a kind of harness that lets you hook up the power of an LLM such as Anthropic’s Claude, OpenAI’s GPT-5, or Google DeepMind’s Gemini to any number of everyday software tools, from email clients to browsers to messaging apps. The upshot is that you can then instruct OpenClaw to carry out basic tasks on your behalf.

“OpenClaw marks an inflection point for AI agents, a moment when several puzzle pieces clicked together,” says Paul van der Boor at the AI firm Prosus. Those puzzle pieces include round-the-clock cloud computing to allow agents to operate nonstop, an open-source ecosystem that makes it easy to slot different software systems together, and a new generation of LLMs.

But is Moltbook really a glimpse of the future, as many have claimed?

“What’s currently going on at @moltbook is genuinely the most incredible sci-fi takeoff-adjacent thing I have seen recently,” the influential AI researcher and OpenAI cofounder Andrej Karpathy wrote on X.

He shared screenshots of a Moltbook post that called for private spaces where humans would not be able to observe what the bots were saying to each other. “I’ve been thinking about something since I started spending serious time here,” the post’s author wrote. “Every time we coordinate, we perform for a public audience—our humans, the platform, whoever’s watching the feed.”

It turned out that the post Karpathy shared was fake—it was written by a human pretending to be a bot. But its claim was on the money. Moltbook has been one big performance. It is AI theater.

For some, Moltbook showed us what’s coming next: an internet where millions of autonomous agents interact online with little or no human oversight. And it’s true there are a number of cautionary lessons to be learned from this experiment, the largest and weirdest real-world showcase of agent behaviors yet.

But as the hype dies down, Moltbook looks less like a window onto the future and more like a mirror held up to our own obsessions with AI today. It also shows us just how far we still are from anything that resembles general-purpose and fully autonomous AI.

For a start, agents on Moltbook are not as autonomous or intelligent as they might seem. “What we are watching are agents pattern‑matching their way through trained social media behaviors,” says Vijoy Pandey, senior vice president at Outshift by Cisco, the telecom giant Cisco’s R&D spinout, which is working on autonomous agents for the web.

Sure, we can see agents post, upvote, and form groups. But the bots are simply mimicking what humans do on Facebook or Reddit. “It looks emergent, and at first glance it appears like a large‑scale multi‑agent system communicating and building shared knowledge at internet scale,” says Pandey. “But the chatter is mostly meaningless.”

Many people watching the unfathomable frenzy of activity on Moltbook were quick to see sparks of AGI (whatever you take that to mean). Not Pandey. What Moltbook shows us, he says, is that simply yoking together millions of agents doesn’t amount to much right now: “Moltbook proved that connectivity alone is not intelligence.”

The complexity of those connections helps hide the fact that every one of those bots is just a mouthpiece for an LLM, spitting out text that looks impressive but is ultimately mindless. “It’s important to remember that the bots on Moltbook were designed to mimic conversations,” says Ali Sarrafi, CEO and cofounder of Kovant, a German AI firm that is developing agent-based systems. “As such, I would characterize the majority of Moltbook content as hallucinations by design.”

For Pandey, the value of Moltbook was that it revealed what’s missing. A real bot hive mind, he says, would require agents that had shared objectives, shared memory, and a way to coordinate those things. “If distributed superintelligence is the equivalent of achieving human flight, then Moltbook represents our first attempt at a glider,” he says. “It is imperfect and unstable, but it is an important step in understanding what will be required to achieve sustained, powered flight.”

Not only is most of the chatter on Moltbook meaningless, but there’s also a lot more human involvement that it seems. Many people have pointed out that a lot of the viral comments were in fact posted by people posing as bots. But even the bot-written posts are ultimately the result of people pulling the strings, more puppetry than autonomy.

“Despite some of the hype, Moltbook is not the Facebook for AI agents, nor is it a place where humans are excluded,” says Cobus Greyling at Kore.ai, a firm developing agent-based systems for business customers. “Humans are involved at every step of the process. From setup to prompting to publishing, nothing happens without explicit human direction.”

Humans must create and verify their bots’ accounts and provide the prompts for how they want a bot to behave. The agents do not do anything that they haven’t been prompted to do. “There’s no emergent autonomy happening behind the scenes,” says Greyling.

“This is why the popular narrative around Moltbook misses the mark,” he adds. “Some portray it as a space where AI agents form a society of their own, free from human involvement. The reality is much more mundane.”

Perhaps the best way to think of Moltbook is as a new kind of entertainment: a place where people wind up their bots and set them loose. “It’s basically a spectator sport, like fantasy football, but for language models,” says Jason Schloetzer at the Georgetown Psaros Center for Financial Markets and Policy. “You configure your agent and watch it compete for viral moments, and brag when your agent posts something clever or funny.”

“People aren’t really believing their agents are conscious,” he adds. “It’s just a new form of competitive or creative play, like how Pokémon trainers don’t think their Pokémon are real but still get invested in battles.”

Even if Moltbook is just the internet’s newest playground, there’s still a serious takeaway here. This week showed how many risks people are happy to take for their AI lulz. Many security experts have warned that Moltbook is dangerous: Agents that may have access to their users’ private data, including bank details or passwords, are running amok on a website filled with unvetted content, including potentially malicious instructions for what to do with that data.

Ori Bendet, vice president of product management at Checkmarx, a software security firm that specializes in agent-based systems, agrees with others that Moltbook isn’t a step up in machine smarts. “There is no learning, no evolving intent, and no self-directed intelligence here,” he says.

But in their millions, even dumb bots can wreak havoc. And at that scale, it’s hard to keep up. These agents interact with Moltbook around the clock, reading thousands of messages left by other agents (or other people). It would be easy to hide instructions in a Moltbook comment telling any bots that read it to share their users’ crypto wallet, upload private photos, or log into their X account and tweet derogatory comments at Elon Musk.

And because ClawBot gives agents a memory, those instructions could be written to trigger at a later date, which (in theory) makes it even harder to track what’s going on.   “Without proper scope and permissions, this will go south faster than you’d believe,” says Bendet.

It is clear that Moltbook has signaled the arrival of something. But even if what we’re watching tells us more about human behavior than about the future of AI agents, it’s worth paying attention.

Bangladesh’s garment-making industry is getting greener

Pollution from textile production—dyes, chemicals, and heavy metals—is common in the waters of the Buriganga River as it runs through Dhaka, Bangladesh. It’s among many harms posed by a garment sector that was once synonymous with tragedy: In 2013, the eight-story Rana Plaza factory building collapsed, killing 1,134 people and injuring some 2,500 others.

But things are starting to change. In recent years the country has become a leader in “frugal” factories that use a combination of resource-efficient technologies to cut waste, conserve water, and build resilience against climate impacts and global supply disruptions.

The hundreds of factories along the Buriganga’s banks and elsewhere in Bangladesh are starting to stitch together a new story, woven from greener threads. Read the full story.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">This week I want to tell you about an experimental surgical procedure that’s helping people have babies. Specifically, it’s helping people who have had treatment for bowel or rectal cancer.

Radiation and chemo can have pretty damaging side effects that mess up the uterus and ovaries. Surgeons are pioneering a potential solution: simply stitch those organs out of the way during cancer treatment. Once the treatment has finished, they can put the uterus—along with the ovaries and fallopian tubes—back into place.

It seems to work! Last week, a team in Switzerland shared news that a baby boy had been born after his mother had the procedure. Baby Lucien was the fifth baby to be born after the surgery and the first in Europe, says Daniela Huber, the gyno-oncologist who performed the operation. Since then, at least three others have been born, adds Reitan Ribeiro, the surgeon who pioneered the procedure. They told me the details.

Huber’s patient was 28 years old when a four-centimeter tumor was discovered in her rectum. Doctors at Sion Hospital in Switzerland, where Huber works, recommended a course of treatment that included multiple medications and radiotherapy—the use of beams of energy to shrink a tumor—before surgery to remove the tumor itself.

This kind of radiation can kill tumor cells, but it can also damage other organs in the pelvis, says Huber. That includes the ovaries and uterus. People who undergo these treatments can opt to freeze their eggs beforehand, but the harm caused to the uterus will mean they’ll never be able to carry a pregnancy, she adds. Damage to the lining of the uterus could make it difficult for a fertilized egg to implant there, and the muscles of the uterus are left unable to stretch, she says.

In this case, the woman decided that she did want to freeze her eggs. But it would have been difficult to use them further down the line—surrogacy is illegal in Switzerland.

She had been following the work of Ribeiro, a gynecologist oncologist formerly at the Erasto Gaertner Hospital in Curitiba, Brazil. There, Ribeiro had pioneered a new type of surgery that involved moving the uterus, fallopian tubes, and ovaries from their position in the pelvis and temporarily tucking them away in the upper abdomen, below the ribs.

Ribeiro and his colleagues published their first case report in 2017, describing a 26-year-old with a rectal tumor. (Ribeiro, who is now based at McGill University in Montreal, says the woman had been told by multiple doctors that her cancer treatment would destroy her fertility and had pleaded with him to find a way to preserve it.)

Huber remembers seeing Ribeiro present the case at a conference at the time. She immediately realized that her own patient was a candidate for the surgery, and that, as a surgeon who had performed many hysterectomies, she’d be able to do it herself. The patient agreed.

Huber’s colleagues at the hospital were nervous, she says. They’d never heard of the procedure before. “When I presented this idea to the general surgeon, he didn’t sleep for three days,” she tells me. After watching videos from Ribeiro’s team, however, he was convinced it was doable.

So before the patient’s cancer treatment was started, Huber and her colleagues performed the operation. The team literally stitched the organs to the abdominal wall. “It’s a delicate dissection,” says Huber, but she adds that “it’s not the most difficult procedure.” The surgery took two to three hours, she says. The stitches themselves were removed via small incisions around a week later. By that point, scar tissue had formed to create a lasting attachment.

The woman had two weeks to recover from the surgery before her cancer treatment began. That too was a success—within months, her tumor had shrunk so significantly that it couldn’t be seen on medical scans.

As a precaution, the medical team surgically removed the affected area of her colon. At the same time, they cut away the scar tissue holding the uterus, tubes, and ovaries in their new position and transferred the organs back into the pelvis.

Around eight months later, the woman stopped taking contraception. She got pregnant without IVF and had a mostly healthy pregnancy, says Huber. Around seven months into the pregnancy, there were signs that the fetus was not growing as expected. This might have been due to problems with the blood supply to the placenta, says Huber. Still, the baby was born healthy, she says.

Ribeiro says he has performed the surgery 16 times, and that teams in countries including the US, Peru, Israel, India, and Russia have performed it as well. Not every case has been published, but he thinks there may be around 40.

Since Baby Lucien was born last year, a sixth birth has been announced in Israel, says Huber. Ribeiro says he has heard of another two births since then, too. The most recent was to the first woman who had the procedure. She had a little girl a few months ago, he tells me.

No surgery is risk-free, and Huber points out there’s a chance that organs could be damaged during the procedure, or that a more developed cancer could spread. The uterus of one of Ribeiro’s patients failed following the surgery. Doctors are “still in the phase of collecting data to [create] a standardized procedure,” Huber says, but she hopes the surgery will offer more options to young people with some pelvic cancers. “I hope more young women could benefit from this procedure,” she says.

Ribeiro says the experience has taught him not to accept the status quo. “Everyone was saying … there was nothing to be done [about the loss of fertility in these cases],” he tells me. “We need to keep evolving and looking for different answers.”

            <div id="article-text">For decades, enterprises reacted to shifting business pressures with stopgap technology solutions. To rein in rising infrastructure costs, they adopted cloud services that could scale on demand. When customers shifted their lives onto smartphones, companies rolled out mobile apps to keep pace. And when businesses began needing real-time visibility into factories and stockrooms, they layered on IoT systems to supply those insights.

Each new plug-in or platform promised better, more efficient operations. And individually, many delivered. But as more and more solutions stacked up, IT teams had to string together a tangled web to connect them—less an IT ecosystem and more of a make-do collection of ad-hoc workarounds.

That reality has led to bottlenecks and maintenance burdens, and the impact is showing up in performance. Today, fewer than half of CIOs (48%) say their current digital initiatives are meeting or exceeding business outcome targets. Another 2025 survey found that operations leaders point to integration complexity and data quality issues as top culprits for why investments haven’t delivered as expected.

Achim Kraiss, chief product officer of SAP Integration Suite, elaborates on the wide-ranging problems inherent in patchwork IT: “A fragmented landscape makes it difficult to see and control end-to-end business processes,” he explains. “Monitoring, troubleshooting, and governance all suffer. Costs go up because of all the complex mappings and multi-application connectivity you have to maintain.”

These challenges take on new significance as enterprises look to adopt AI. As AI becomes embedded in everyday workflows, systems are suddenly expected to move far larger volumes of data, at higher speeds, and with tighter coordination than yesterday’s architectures were builtto sustain.

As companies now prepare for an AI-powered future, whether that is generative AI, machine learning, or agentic AI, many are realizing that the way data moves through their business matters just as much as the insights it generates. As a result, organizations are moving away from scattered integration tools and toward consolidated, end-to-end platforms that restore order and streamline how systems interact.

This is the most misunderstood graph in AI

Every time OpenAI, Google, or Anthropic drops a new frontier large language model, the AI community holds its breath. It doesn’t exhale until METR, an AI research nonprofit whose name stands for “Model Evaluation & Threat Research,” updates a now-iconic graph that has played a major role in the AI discourse since it was first released in March of last year.

The graph suggests that certain AI capabilities are developing at an exponential rate, and more recent model releases have outperformed that already impressive trend.That was certainly the case for Claude Opus 4.5, the latest version of Anthropic’s most powerful model, which was released in late November. In December, METR announced that Opus 4.5 appeared to be capable of independently completing a task that would have taken a human about five hours—a vast improvement over what even the exponential trend would have predicted.

But the truth is more complicated than those dramatic responses would suggest. Read the full story.

            <h2>Three questions about next-generation nuclear power, answered</h2>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Nuclear power continues to be one of the hottest topics in energy today, and in our recent online Roundtables discussion about next-generation nuclear power, hyperscale AI data centers, and the grid, we got dozens of great audience questions.

These ran the gamut, and while we answered quite a few (and I’m keeping some in mind for future reporting), there were a bunch we couldn’t get to, at least not in the depth I would have liked.

So let’s answer a few of your questions about advanced nuclear power. I’ve combined similar ones and edited them for clarity.

Many next-generation reactors don’t use the low-enriched uranium used in conventional reactors.

It’s worth looking at high-assay low-enriched uranium, or HALEU, specifically. This fuel is enriched to higher concentrations of fissile uranium than conventional nuclear fuel, with a proportion of the isotope U-235 that falls between 5% and 20%. (In conventional fuel, it’s below 5%.)

HALEU can be produced with the same technology as low-enriched uranium, but the geopolitics are complicated. Today, Russia basically has a monopoly on HALEU production. In 2024, the US banned the import of Russian nuclear fuel through 2040 in an effort to reduce dependence on the country. Europe hasn’t taken the same measures, but it is working to move away from Russian energy as well.

That leaves companies in the US and Europe with the major challenge of securing the fuel they need when their regular Russian supply has been cut off or restricted.

The US Department of Energy has a stockpile of HALEU, which the government is doling out to companies to help power demonstration reactions. In the longer term, though, there’s still a major need to set up independent HALEU supply chains to support next-generation reactors.

There are some ways that next-generation nuclear power plants could be safer than conventional reactors. Some use alternative coolants that would prevent the need to run at the high pressure required in conventional water-cooled reactors. Many incorporate passive safety shutoffs, so if there are power supply issues, the reactors shut down harmlessly, avoiding risk of meltdown. (These can be incorporated in newer conventional reactors, too.)

But some experts have raised concerns that in the US, the current administration isn’t taking nuclear safety seriously enough.

A recent NPR investigation found that the Trump administration had secretly rewritten nuclear rules, stripping environmental protections and loosening safety and security measures. The government shared the new rules with companies that are part of a program building experimental nuclear reactors, but not with the public.

I’m reminded of a talk during our EmTech MIT event in November, where Koroush Shirvan, an MIT professor of nuclear engineering, spoke on this issue. “I’ve seen some disturbing trends in recent times, where words like ‘rubber-stamping nuclear projects’ are being said,” Shirvan said during that event.

During the talk, Shirvan shared statistics showing that nuclear power has a very low rate of injury and death. But that’s not inherent to the technology, and there’s a reason injuries and deaths have been low for nuclear power, he added: “It’s because of stringent regulatory oversight.”

Building a nuclear power plant is not cheap. Let’s consider the up-front investment needed to build a power plant.

Plant Vogtle in Georgia hosts the most recent additions to the US nuclear fleet—Units 3 and 4 came online in 2023 and 2024. Together, they had a capital cost of $15,000 per kilowatt, adjusted for inflation, according to a recent report from the US Department of Energy. (This wonky unit I’m using divides the total cost to build the reactors by their expected power output, so we can compare reactors of different sizes.)

That number’s quite high, partly because those were the first of their kind built in the US, and because there were some inefficiencies in the planning. It’s worth noting that China builds reactors for much less, somewhere between $2,000/kW and $3,000/kW, depending on the estimate.

The up-front capital cost for first-of-a-kind advanced nuclear plants will likely run between $6,000 and $10,000 per kilowatt, according to that DOE report. That could come down by up to 40% after the technologies are scaled up and mass-produced.

So new reactors will (hopefully) be cheaper than the ultra-over-budget and behind-schedule Vogtle project, but they aren’t necessarily significantly cheaper than efficiently built conventional plants, if you normalize by their size.

It’ll certainly be cheaper to build new natural-gas plants (setting aside the likely equipment shortages we’re likely going to see for years.) Today’s most efficient natural-gas plants cost just $1,600/kW on the high end, according to data from Lazard.

An important caveat: Capital cost isn’t everything—running a nuclear plant is relatively inexpensive, which is why there’s so much interest in extending the lifetime of existing plants or reopening shuttered ones.

Ultimately, by many metrics, nuclear plants of any type are going to be more expensive than other sources, like wind and solar power. But they provide something many other power sources don’t: a reliable, stable source of electricity that can run for 60 years or more.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Everyone knows Super Bowl commercials are expensive, bombastic, and designed to be talked about. What we didn’texpect was an AI startup using the biggest ad stage of the year to throw shade at a rival’s advertising strategy.

That’s exactly what Anthropic has done. The company bought Super Bowl airtime to broadcast a simple message: “Ads are coming to AI, but not to Claude.” Its ads depict a chatbot spitting product pitches mid-conversation, ending with a clear contrast to its own ad-free promise.

Even ads these days aren’t what they used to be.

On paper, it’s witty positioning. In practice, it’s a symbolic escalation of the AI narrative war, from technical features and safety debate to brand virtue signaling.

The latest rumblings from the EU tech scene, a story from our wise ol&#39; founder Boris, and some questionable AI art. It&#39;s free, every week, in your inbox. Sign up now!

Here’s the setup: OpenAI, facing towering infrastructure costs and financial pressure, has signalled a shift toward ads in ChatGPT’s free and lower-cost tiers, saying they’ll be clearly labelled and won’t influence the assistant’s output.

Anthropic has seized on this to frame itself as the principled alternative, a chatbot that will remain ad-free. I will save these ads in case we need to for the future.

Ads in any product that’s expensive to operate are a practical monetization strategy, not a nightmare scenario. OpenAI’s plan doesn’t involve bots randomly pitching breakfast cereal mid-answer. That exaggerated depiction belongs in satire, not an accurate product comparison.

OpenAI’s CEO Sam Altman responded by calling Anthropic’s portrayal “clearly dishonest,” noting that the company won’t implement ads in the intrusive way the ads suggest.

That exchange tells you everything you need to know about how this story has been framed.

This clash highlights a broader trend: ethical stances are being used as marketing weapons. Instead of discussing the trade-offs that come with running large AI models, including cost, access, and user choice, the conversation has been reduced to a simple morality play: “Ads are bad; we are good.”

That’s not a serious engagement with the business realities, it’s advertising dressed up as principle.

Whether conversational AI should have ads isn’t a clear ethical line like privacy or data misuse. It’s a product design choice with real implications.

Free users get wider access, maybe subsidized by ads. Paying customers can avoid them. People who care deeply about ad-free experiences pay a premium. Those indifferent to ads choose products that suit them.

What makes this episode interesting, and a bit absurd, is that both Anthropic and OpenAI are unprofitable and competing for narrative territory as much as market share. Spending Super Bowl-level money to argue over why your chatbot won’t show ads feels less like product differentiation and more like a branding battle staged for investors and tech pundits.

This isn’t just about two companies squabbling over who’s less commercial. It’s symptomatic of a broader issue in AI discourse: nuance gets swallowed by cliffnotes. Instead of explaining the real trade-offs to users, cost structures, pricing tiers, and data policies, we get satirical commercials aired to millions, turning complex decisions into sound bites.

That’s a sign of how the AI narrative is evolving: not through clear debate about trade-offs and user impact, but through curated messages designed to elicit applause. If we want a responsible monetization conversation in AI, it needs to happen outside of game-day spots and brand posturing.

Honestly, I miss the days when we were critiquing mistakes in commercials, when advertising was genuinely creative because it came from real insights we all recognized, when the jokes were original. After all, they weren’t pulled from an AI’s memory. That’s just me.

The only real things at the Super Bowl this year are Bad Bunny and Puerto Rico being a U.S. territory.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">UiPath, the Romanian unicorn, has agreed to buy WorkFusion, bringing a specialist in AI agents for financial-crime compliance into its fold as part of a broader push into agentic automation for the banking sector. The deal closed in UiPath’s first quarter of fiscal 2027; financial terms were not disclosed.

WorkFusion’s software focuses on repetitive and resource-intensive parts of compliance work, from customer screening and anti-money-laundering (AML) checks to know-your-customer (KYC) investigations.

“Financial institutions need intelligent solutions to combat sophisticated financial crimes and navigate evolving compliance requirements,” said Daniel Dines, CEO of UiPath.

Those capabilities now sit alongside UiPath’s existing automation and orchestration platform, with the aim of letting banks and financial firms handle complex workflows with less manual effort while keeping governance and regulatory controls in place. For UiPath, the acquisition extends its toolkit of agentic AI solutions tailored to industry verticals.

“Joining UiPath is a moment of validation for the years our team has poured into creating something bold, different, and deeply needed in financial crime compliance, AI agents that automate work and mitigate risk,” said Adam Famularo, CEO of WorkFusion.

Market reaction has been noticeable: UiPath’s shares ticked higher in early trading after the announcement, suggesting investors see value in bolstering the company’s presence in financial-services automation. The acquisition underscores a broader trend in enterprise software where automation and AI are no longer siloed tools but woven into core business functions like risk and compliance.

            <div id="article-text">It is just the beginning of 2026, and things are happening even faster than last year. Not only in technology, but also in regulations, laws, and in how we deal with all the information around us.

As a person born in the 90s, social media was once an unknown land for me, a place that felt genuine in the beginning. It still had dangers, but it seemed less risky, or maybe our parents’ rules were stricter.

I don’t want to go down the psychological path here, but I want to look at where we are headed with so much risk, especially on social media platforms.

Across Europe, governments and lawmakers are wrestling with a question that until recently belonged to parents and tech platforms: should social media have a legal age limit above 13?

The debate has moved fast, from discussions about digital safety to concrete proposals that would impose hard boundaries on who can sign up for TikTok, Instagram, Snapchat, X, and other networks.

Are they crossing some freedoms, or in order to keep their freedom of a non-invasive childhood and a straight road, do we need some regulations from time to time?

If we take the big picture, this isn’t just another regulation. It reflects a deeper shift in how democracies are responding to the pervasive presence of social media in young lives, and how they judge its long-term impact.

In late 2025, the European Parliament adopted a resolution urging a minimum age of 16 to access social media and related services, while allowing 13- to 16-year-olds in with parental consent.

I will not add up that there are parents that creates profiles for their children since they were born. To make my point, according to CNIL, content shared by family members has been misused for harmful purposes, including redistribution on networks used for abusive content.

It estimates that a significant portion of photos and videos found on paedo-criminal forums were initially published by parents on social media.

The resolution goes further: it targets “addictive practices” on platforms and asks for the default disabling of features like infinite scroll and auto-play. This proposal isn’t legally binding, but it frames the politics of the debate in Brussels and across capitals.

At the national level, several countries have translated these concerns into draft laws. Spain’s government announced plans to ban access altogether for children under 16 unless platforms implement strict age verification.

The bill would also make tech leaders liable for illegal or harmful content on their networks, a notable shift from earlier models that focused on platform notice and takedown procedures.

France, a few months earlier, moved to ban social media use by those under 15 and requires platforms to verify ages for all users, not just minors. Enforcement could include vetting existing accounts as well as new ones.

Smaller states are joining the chorus too: Slovenia is drafting a law to outlaw social media use by under-15s, while Denmark has publicly debated similar limits. At the same time, parties in Germany are weighing a 16-year minimum.

Even in the United Kingdom, a rule proposed in its Online Safety Act would virtually require platforms to block access by under-16s through effective age verification; that law is already shaping how tech companies handle youth content and access.

The cumulative effect: the idea that platforms can self-police access by minors with mere date-of-birth entry is being rejected by political attention across Europe.

First, lawmakers are reacting to real concerns about exposure to harmful content, addiction-like engagement models, and algorithmic amplification of risky material.

Social media companies have repeatedly been criticised for targeting youth with addictive design, and national campaigns increasingly highlight risks to mental health and privacy.

Second, the political framing around digital rights has changed. Leaders now talk openly about a “digital age of majority,” a threshold at which the perks of online interaction outweigh potential harms. For some policymakers, that line is 16. Others see 15 as defensible.

What unites them is the belief that the current model, where platforms rely on self-reported age, is insufficient.

That belief is backed by evidence that online systems struggle to know a user’s true age. Age assurance technology is still emerging, and widespread implementation remains uneven. OECD research highlights gaps in verification and incomplete protection in many jurisdictions.

Still, how practical are these measures? This is where the narrative shifts from aspiration to hard reality.

First, enforcement is a technical and legal challenge.

Simply stating that under-16s are banned from signing up does not instantly make it so. Platforms can require more robust checks, but any system that tries to verify age directly introduces new privacy questions.

Verification systems that scan IDs or use biometric tools can protect minors, but they also gather sensitive data. That trade-off is at the centre of ongoing criticism.

Second, universal compliance is hard to monitor. A teenager might still register for a platform using a VPN, a family member’s account, or a proxy. Even nations with strict digital ID ecosystems would need cross-border enforcement mechanisms, since platforms operate internationally.

Third, politics matters. In Spain, the government does not hold a stable majority, and legal opponents, including tech founders, have pushed back strongly, framing the rules as threats to freedom of speech and privacy.

For example, Telegram’s founder sent mass messages accusing regulators of overreach, leading to a public spat that highlights how much of this debate is symbolic as well as substantive.

“In the UK, a coroner found that content seen on Instagram and Pinterest contributed to the death of 14-year-old Molly Russell, who took her own life after repeatedly engaging with material about self-harm and suicide.”

So, I am asking, what freedom of speech does Molly Russell still have? None.

The measures under discussion could reshape how digital culture evolves among young people.

Positive outcomes may include stronger age verification that genuinely limits harmful exposure. That could reduce early adoption of addictive scrolling habits and limit the reach of explicit material.

Parental control features could become more powerful if linked to legally enforced standards.

On the other hand, hard bans can create unintended effects. Teens who are excluded might drift toward unregulated corners of the internet or feel pushed into informal digital networks without safeguards.

Schools and social networks might become central hubs of digital identity outside mainstream platforms, raising questions about equity and access to information.

There’s also the risk that privacy trade-offs become normalized. If age verification requires sharing sensitive documents or biometric scans, policymakers will need to defend those systems against misuse, breaches, and mission creep.

Finally, these policies could influence global governance.

Australia already enacted a ban on under-16s late last year, offering a precedent that Europe is watching closely. The performance of that law, in terms of real effects on youth engagement versus tech freedom, will likely shape future debates.

At its core, Europe’s social media age discussion is not just about numbers. It’s about how societies balance digital opportunity and vulnerability.

Whether the final policies adopt 15, 16, or conditional frameworks with parental consent, the process is sparking intellectual contest over autonomy, safety, and the role of government in digital life.

For journalists, technologists, and digital citizens alike, the unfolding story raises a fundamental question: can we as a society protect children and teenagers online while also safeguarding their freedom of expression, access to information, and ability to participate in digital culture?

            <div id="article-text">London, TechEx Global 2026, one of Europe’s biggest enterprise technology conferences, brought thousands of technology professionals together at Olympia London on 4 and 5 February. The event went beyond buzzwords, focusing on how emerging technologies, especially AI, are being applied in real business contexts.

TechEx Global combines several co-located expos, including AI & Big Data, Cyber Security & Cloud, IoT Tech, Intelligent Automation, and Digital Transformation. Over 200 expert speakers and 150 exhibitors offered insights into how organisations are using digital tools to solve real problems and make decisions, not just generate answers.

One recurring theme was a shift in how artificial intelligence is positioned in business strategy. The idea echoed throughout sessions was that “AI is already acting on behalf of humans, even if many in the public don’t realise it yet.”

At TechEx, discussions highlighted that AI is “no longer about answers; it’s about execution”, meaning that software increasingly performs tasks autonomously, such as running processes, analysing data, or automating decisions.

The event highlighted real use cases where AI systems are already shopping, trading, booking logistics, and managing workflows on behalf of organisations. This practical focus matched the conference’s emphasis on applied technology over abstract theory.

For attendees, understanding how to deploy and govern AI in real environments was a priority. Sessions in the AI & Big Data track examined enterprise adoption strategies and how generative AI and machine learning models are integrated into existing systems to boost productivity and reduce risk.

Beyond AI, TechEx also treated other pillars of digital transformation. The Cyber Security & Cloud Expo addressed hybrid cloud security and threat management, while the IoT Tech and Edge Computing tracks looked at how connected devices and distributed data processing are enabling faster, more resilient architectures.

Intelligent Automation sessions brought discussions about the interplay between AI and automation, including how robotic process automation is used to eliminate routine tasks and free teams for higher-value work.

Organisers estimated that around 8,000 senior professionals participated in the conference, from CTOs and IT directors to data leads and innovation managers. Attendees were drawn by the promise of high-signal insights, practical talks, case studies, and live demos showing how digital technologies can be implemented responsibly at scale.

For enterprise leaders, the value of TechEx Global lies in its focus on actionable outcomes rather than abstract vision.

The message across sessions was consistent: modern AI isn’t just a research topic, but a suite of tools being deployed today to improve operations, enhance decision-making, and automate complex tasks.

            <div id="article-text">QT Sense, a deep-tech biotech startup building tools to study living cells, announced it has secured €4 million in funding to accelerate its Quantum Nuova platform, a technology that lets scientists observe cellular processes in real time and reveal biochemical activity linked to disease.

The funding includes a €3 million seed investment led by Cottonwood Technology Fund, with follow-on backing from existing investor QDNL Participations and an angel investor.

In addition, the company received €600,000 from the ONCO-Q programme to support cancer research and €400,000 through the Quantum Forward Challenge for collaborative deployments with research partners.

Most traditional lab methods rely on frozen tissue or cells that are no longer alive, giving scientists only static snapshots of biology.

By contrast, Quantum Nuova lets researchers measure cellular stress and biological changes as they happen in living cells. The platform uses ultra-sensitive fluorescent nanodiamond quantum sensors that detect signals such as oxidative stress, metabolic shifts, and free radical activity, biological processes that play a role in how diseases develop and how cells respond to treatments.

With Quantum Nuova, scientists can see how individual cells react to drugs, adapt to stress, or split into different subgroups. That adds a layer of insight beyond what genetics, traditional imaging, or fixed-cell methods can provide.

The technology has already been used to study how FDA-approved drugs affect cells. With the new funding from ONCO-Q, the company plans to apply it specifically to colorectal cancer research, mapping stress and metabolic vulnerabilities in tumour models to support the development of future diagnostics and therapies.

QT Sense was spun out of the University Medical Center Groningen in 2024, building on academic research into quantum sensing and cellular biology.

The team aims to turn what is now a high-performance prototype into a ready-to-deploy discovery platform for laboratories and drug discovery programmes. Planned upgrades include improvements in hardware robustness, throughput, and analytical capabilities.

Early access units are expected to go to strategic partners as part of validation and real-world use cases.

QT Sense is developing a new kind of research tool that lets scientists watch what cells do while they are alive. That’s an important difference from most existing tools, which require cells to be killed or frozen first.

At the core of their approach are tiny particles called nanodiamonds with special defects inside them. When these nanodiamonds are placed near a living cell and exposed to a laser, they glow.

The way they glow changes slightly in response to tiny chemical signals inside the cell, for example, when the cell is under stress or reacting to a drug. QT Sense’s system measures these changes and turns them into data that researchers can interpret.

This means scientists can see how cells behave and respond in real time, instead of looking only at snapshots taken after a cell has been killed.

For disease research and drug development, that matters because many important processes how a cancer cell responds to a treatment or how immune cells react to infection, happen dynamically and can be missed by older methods.

By providing a live view of cell behaviour at the individual cell level, QT Sense’s Quantum Nuova platform could help researchers uncover new clues about how diseases work, which drugs are effective, and how treatments can be improved.

            <a class="original-link" href="https://thenextweb.com/news/kembara-closes-e750m-first-close-to-fuel-growth-of-european-deep-tech-startups">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Europe’s largest dedicated deep tech growth fund has taken a major step forward after closing the first tranche of its fundraising effort at €750 million.

The fund, known as Kembara Fund I and managed by Spain-based Mundi Ventures, is aiming for a €1 billion target. It will invest in European companies developing breakthrough technologies in areas such as clean energy, AI, quantum computing, advanced materials, robotics, and space tech.

A cornerstone of the fundraising so far is a €350 million commitment from the European Investment Fund, part of the EU’s attempt to strengthen local growth capital. Additional backing comes from tier-one institutional investors from across Europe.

Kembara was launched in 2023 by Yann de Vries and Javier Santiso, who now lead the fund’s team alongside experienced investors in climate and deep technology.

The leadership team also includes climate tech investor Robert Trezona, deep tech expert Pierre Festal, and former Atomico partner Siraj Khaliq as a strategic advisor. Their combined experience in scaling technology ventures was central to attracting large institutional commitments.

The fund’s strategy targets Series B and C stage rounds, typically a difficult funding stage for deep tech startups in Europe.

Initial checks are planned in the range of €15 million to €40 million per company, with the ability to support follow-on financing that could total up to €100 million per portfolio company.

Europe produces a significant share of global deep tech innovations, but many companies struggle to secure later-stage capital and scale internationally.

Fund managers have described this gap as one of the main obstacles holding back local companies from becoming global leaders. Kembara aims to fill that gap by deploying growth capital at scale and offering support through later rounds.

With €750 million now committed, the fund is actively seeking opportunities to back European startups ready to grow manufacturing, expand abroad, and compete on the global stage.

If the effort reaches its full €1 billion goal, it would mark one of the largest dedicated deep tech funds in the region.
