            <h2>Samsung’s Ballie home robot, once promised for summer 2025, gets grim update</h2>
            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-01-07</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2026/01/samsung-squashes-hopes-that-it-will-release-its-ballie-home-robot/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Since 2020, Samsung has been dangling a yellow ball in front of us. That sphere is a robot named Ballie that Samsung has teased and demoed for home use, including serving as a smart speaker. Today, Ballie is confirmed to be facing an eternity as vaporware.

At CES 2020, Ars Technica reported that Ballie was “the furthest-along concept” that Samsung demonstrated. At the time, we saw Ballie use facial recognition to follow its owner. A marketing video also portrayed the robot controlling smart home devices, including activating a smart vacuum when someone made a mess.

Ballie rolled back onto the trade show scene at CES 2024. This time, it had a new, more spherical, and larger build rolling upon its three wheels. Ballie also sported a light ring, and Samsung showed a video of the robot being used as a projector. The South Korean firm claimed that Ballie would provide “two to three hours of continued projector use” before needing a charge. Samsung’s video also demontrated Ballie connecting with a smartphone.

Come CES 2025, Samsung was giving limited Ballie demos of the robot doing things like sending directions to a phone and making wine recommendations. At the show, Samsung said Ballie would be available for purchase sometime that year. In April, Samsung announced that it would sell the robot in the US and South Korea in the summer of 2025.

“Available to consumers this summer, Ballie will be able to engage in natural, conversational interactions to help users manage home environments, including adjusting lighting, greeting people at the door, personalizing schedules, setting reminders, and more,” the press release said, pointing to the robot’s implementation of Google Gemini.

It’s now 2026, and Ballie still hasn’t come out. Bloomberg reported today that the device has been “indefinitely shelved.” The publication noted that a company spokesperson called Ballie an “active innovation platform” for internal use, which is noticeably different from referring to it as a gadget that people will eventually be able to buy.

“After multiple years of real-world testing, it continues to inform how Samsung designs spatially aware, context-driven experiences, particularly in areas like smart home intelligence, ambient AI and privacy-by-design,” a Samsung spokesperson said in a statement to Bloomberg.

The website for registering to “get the chance to be the first to meet Ballie” is still up, and it’s possible that Samsung could still release Ballie.

But for now, Samsung may not be confident that Ballie will consistently deliver its advertised features over a long period and/or drum up enough interest from people who can pay the likely high price for a home robot. With many technology companies rethinking their approaches to chatbots, AI in smart speakers, and home robots, Samsung may have decided it was more prudent to extract features from Ballie for use in other products. Ballie likely requires deeper exploration around how it can be more useful and reliable before Samsung goes to market—if it ever does.</div>

            <h2>AI starts autonomously writing prescription refills in Utah</h2>
            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-01-07</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2026/01/utah-allows-ai-to-autonomously-prescribe-medication-refills/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The state of Utah is allowing artificial intelligence to prescribe medication refills to patients without direct human oversight in a pilot program public advocates call “dangerous.”

The program is through the state’s “regulatory sandbox” framework, which allows businesses to trial “innovative” products or services with state regulations temporarily waived. The Utah Department of Commerce partnered with Doctronic, a telehealth startup with an AI chatbot.

Doctronic offers a nationwide service that allows patients to chat with its “AI doctor” for free, then, for $39, book a virtual appointment with a real doctor licensed in their state. But patients must go through the AI chatbot first to get an appointment.

According to a non-peer-reviewed preprint article from Doctronic, which looked at 500 telehealth cases in its service, the company claims its AI’s diagnosis matched the diagnosis made by a real clinician in 81 percent of cases. The AI’s treatment plan was “consistent” with that of a doctor’s in 99 percent of the cases.

Now, for patients in Utah, Doctronic’s chatbot can refill a prescription without a doctor, for a $4 service fee . After a patient signs in and verifies state residency, the AI chatbot can pull up the patient’s prescription history and offer a list of prescription medications eligible for a refill. According to Politico, the chatbot will only be able to renew prescriptions for 190 common medications for chronic conditions, with key exclusions, such as medications for pain and ADHD, and those that are injected.

The first 250 renewals for each drug class will be reviewed by real doctors, but after that, the AI chatbot will be on its own. Adam Oskowitz, Doctronic co-founder and a professor at the University of California, San Francisco, told Politico that the AI chatbot is designed to err on the side of safety and escalate any case with uncertainty to a real doctor.

“Utah’s approach to regulatory mitigation strikes a vital balance between fostering innovation and ensuring consumer safety,” Margaret Woolley Busse, executive director of the Utah Department of Commerce, said in a statement.

For now, it’s unclear if the Food and Drug Administration will step in to regulate AI prescribing. On the one hand, prescription renewals are a matter of practicing medicine, which falls under state governance. However, Politico notes that the FDA has said that it has the authority to regulate medical devices used to diagnose, treat, or prevent disease.

In a statement, Robert Steinbrook, health research group director at watchdog Public Citizen, blasted Doctronic’s program and the lack of oversight. “AI should not be autonomously refilling prescriptions, nor identifying itself as an ‘AI doctor,&#39;” Steinbrook said.

“Although the thoughtful application of AI can help to improve aspects of medical care, the Utah pilot program is a dangerous first step toward more autonomous medical practice,” he said.&quot;The FDA and other federal regulatory agencies cannot look the other way when AI applications undermine the essential human clinician role in prescribing and renewing medications.”</div>

            <h2>Warner Bros. sticks with Netflix merger, calls Paramount’s $108B bid “illusory”</h2>
            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-01-07</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2026/01/warner-bros-sticks-with-netflix-merger-calls-paramounts-108b-bid-illusory/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The Warner Bros. Discovery board has unanimously voted to rebuff Paramount’s $108.4 billion offer and urged shareholders to reject the hostile takeover bid. The board is continuing to support Netflix’s pending $82.7 billion purchase of its streaming and movie studios businesses along with a separate spinoff of the Warner Bros. cable TV division.

Warner Bros. called the Paramount bid “illusory” in a presentation for shareholders today, saying the offer requires an “extraordinary amount of debt financing” and other terms that make it less likely to be completed than a Netflix merger. It would be the largest leveraged buyout ever, “with $87B of total pro forma gross debt,” and is “effectively a one-sided option for PSKY [Paramount Skydance] as the offer can be terminated or amended by PSKY at any time,” Warner Bros. said.

The Warner Bros. presentation touted Netflix’s financial strength while saying that Paramount “is a $14B market cap company with a ‘junk’ credit rating, negative free cash flows, significant fixed financial obligations, and a high degree of dependency on its linear business.” The Paramount “offer is illusory as it cannot be completed before it is currently scheduled to expire,” Warner Bros. said.

Warner Bros. said in a letter to shareholders today that it prefers Netflix with its “market capitalization of approximately $400 billion, an investment grade balance sheet, an A/A3 credit rating and estimated free cash flow of more than $12 billion for 2026.” Moreover, the deal with Netflix provides Warner Bros. with “more flexibility to operate in a normal course until closing,” the letter said.

Even if Paramount is able to complete a deal, “WBD stockholders will not receive cash for 12-18 months and you cannot trade your shares while shares are tendered,” the board told investors. Despite the seemingly firm position, Warner Bros. Discovery board Chairman Samuel Di Piazza Jr. seemed to suggest in an appearance on CNBC’s Squawk Box today that the board could be swayed by a higher offer.

On December 5, after a bidding war that also involved Paramount and Comcast, Warner Bros. struck a deal to sell Netflix its streaming and movie studios businesses. Netflix, already the world’s largest streaming service, would become an even bigger juggernaut if it completes the takeover including rival HBO Max, WB Studios, and other assets.

While the Paramount bid is higher, it would involve the purchase of more Warner Bros. assets than the deal with Netflix. “Unlike Netflix, Paramount is seeking to buy the company’s legacy television and cable assets such as CNN, TNT, and Discovery Channel,” the Financial Times wrote. “Netflix plans to acquire WBD after it spins off its cable TV business, which is scheduled to happen this year.”

Paramount, which recently completed an $8 billion merger with Skydance, submitted its bid for a hostile takeover days after the Netflix/Warner Bros. deal was announced. Warner Bros. resisted, and Paramount amended its offer on December 22 to address objections.

“Larry Ellison has agreed to provide an irrevocable personal guarantee of $40.4 billion of the equity financing for the offer and any damages claims against Paramount,” Paramount said. It also said it offered “improved flexibility to WBD on debt refinancing transactions, representations and interim operating covenants.”

Larry Ellison’s son, David Ellison, is the chairman and CEO of Paramount Skydance. In his CNBC appearance, Di Piazza acknowledged that “Larry Ellison stepped up to the table and the board recognizes what he did.” But “ultimately, he didn’t raise the price. So, in our perspective, Netflix continues to be the superior offer, a clear path to closing.”

Warner Bros. shareholders currently have a January 21 deadline for tendering shares under the Paramount offer, but that could change, as Paramount has indicated it could sweeten the deal further.

Warner Bros. said in the letter to shareholders today that the latest offer still isn’t good enough. Paramount is “attempting an acquisition requiring $94.65 billion of debt and equity financing, nearly seven times its total market capitalization,” requiring it “to incur an extraordinary amount of incremental debt—more than $50 billion—through arrangements with multiple financing partners,” the letter said.

Warner Bros. said that breaking the deal with Netflix would require it to pay Netflix a $2.8 billion termination fee. Either Paramount or Netflix would have to pay Warner Bros. a $5.8 billion termination fee if the buyer can’t get regulatory approval for a merger. But if a Paramount deal failed, there would also be $4.7 billion in unreimbursed costs for shareholders, reducing the effective termination fee to $1.1 billion, according to Warner Bros.

“In the large majority of cases, when an overbidder comes in, they take that break[up] fee and pay it,” Di Piazza said on CNBC.

Warner Bros. Discovery also said the Paramount offer would prohibit it from completing its planned separation of Discovery Global and Warner Bros., which it argues will bring substantial benefits to shareholders by letting each of the separated entities “focus on its own strategic plan.” This separation can be completed even if Netflix is unable to complete the merger for regulatory reasons, it said.

We contacted Paramount and will update this article if it provides any response.

Warner Bros. is facing pressure from one of its top shareholders to negotiate further with Paramount. “Pentwater Capital Management, a hedge-fund manager that is among Warner’s top shareholders, told the board in a letter Wednesday that it is failing in its fiduciary duty to shareholders by not engaging in discussions with Paramount,” according to The Wall Street Journal.

The hedge-fund manager said the board should at least ask Paramount what improvements it is willing to make to its offer. “Pentwater vowed to vote against the merger and not support the renomination of directors in the future if Paramount raises its offer and Warner’s board doesn’t have further discussions with the company,” the Journal wrote.

The Warner Bros. board argued in its letter that “PSKY has continued to submit offers that still include many of the deficiencies we previously repeatedly identified to PSKY, none of which are present in the Netflix merger agreement, all while asserting that its offers do not represent its ‘best and final’ proposal.”

However, Di Piazza suggested on CNBC that Paramount could still put a superior offer on the table. “They had that opportunity in the seventh proposal, the eighth proposal, and they haven’t done it,” he said. “And so from our perspective, they’ve got to put something on the table that is compelling and is superior.”

Netflix issued a statement today saying it “is engaging with competition authorities, including the US Department of Justice and European Commission,” to move the deal forward. “As previously disclosed, the transaction is expected to close in 12-18 months from the date that Netflix and WBD originally entered into their merger agreement,” Netflix said.</div>

            <h2>Bose open-sources its SoundTouch home theater smart speakers ahead of end-of-life</h2>
            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-01-07</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2026/01/bose-open-sources-its-soundtouch-home-theater-smart-speakers-ahead-of-eol/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Bose released the Application Programming Interface (API) documentation for its SoundTouch speakers today, putting a silver lining around the impending end-of-life (EoL) of the expensive home theater devices.

In October, Bose announced that its SoundTouch Wi-Fi speakers and soundbars would become dumb speakers on February 18. At the time, Bose said that the speakers would only work if a device was connected via AUX, HDMI, or Bluetooth (which has higher latency than Wi-Fi).

After that date, the speakers would stop receiving security and software updates and lose cloud connectivity and their companion app, the Framingham, Massachusetts-based company said. Without the app, users would no longer be able to integrate the device with music services, such as Spotify, have multiple SoundTouch devices play the same audio simultaneously, or use or edit saved presets.

The announcement frustrated some of Bose’s long-time customers, some of whom own multiple SoundTouch devices that still function properly. Many questioned companies’ increasingly common practice of bricking expensive products to focus on new devices or to minimize costs, or because they’ve gone through acquisitions or bankruptcy. SoundTouch speakers released in 2013 and 2015 with prices ranging from $399 to $1,500.

Today, Bose had better news. In an email to customers, Bose announced that AirPlay and Spotify Connect will still work with SoundTouch speakers after EoL, expanding the wireless capabilities that people will still be able to access.

Additionally, SoundTouch devices that support AirPlay 2 can play the same audio simultaneously.

The SoundTouch app will also live on, albeit stripped of some functionality.

“On May 6, 2026, the app will update to a version that supports the functions that can operate locally without the cloud. No action will be required on your part. Opening the app will apply the update automatically,” Bose said.

Bose also provided instructions for a workaround for saving presets that uses the favorites options in music service apps.

In recent years, especially, we’ve seen numerous companies that make smart devices abandon their products, leaving users with few options. Often, when a company announces that it will brick one of its smart devices, there’s a call for the company to open-source the gadget’s API and firmware so that already-purchased devices don’t become e-waste and so people can continue using them or even add functionality to the device.

Companies are often reluctant to do this, however, with a key concern being that the device—and therefore the company that originally made it—could become associated with a controversial hack.

Bose doesn’t seem worried about that, though, as today it emailed customers SoundTouch’s API documentation [PDF] “so that independent developers can create their own SoundTouch-compatible tools and features.”

There are SoundTouch owners who will remain inconvenienced when Bose discontinues the devices in May. Despite the changes announced today, Bose is still killing some popular functionality on speakers that would work perfectly fine otherwise.

Ideally, Bose would support its products for as long as they are functioning. But for many smart home companies, that’s not feasible or desirable because such ongoing support can take resources away from other projects with larger user bases or can otherwise detract from growing or sustaining business by encouraging fewer purchases. It can also be complex and costly to get older devices to work with newer software and other technologies.

Truthfully, companies like Bose will continue to seek ways to make more money and to sell more devices. If such companies refuse to stop bricking their customers’ gadgets before we’re ready, the steps that Bose is taking with SoundTouch should be more common.

Open-sourcing devices so that people who have already invested in them can continue enjoying them and striving to maintain as much device functionality as possible is the least that smart device makers can do before discontinuing customers’ beloved devices.</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">If you’re a Mac user with Logitech accessories and you’ve noticed that your settings and customizations seem to have gone away this week, you’re not alone.

The company’s Logi Options+ and G Hub apps for macOS abruptly stopped functioning on Monday, refusing to launch and reverting all accessories’ settings to their built-in defaults.

The culprit, according to both a Logitech support page and Reddit posts from Logitech Head of Global Marketing Joe Santucci, was a security certificate that was inadvertently allowed to expire, rendering both apps non-functional.

“The certificate that expired is used to secure inter-process communications and the expiration results in the software not being able to start successfully,” wrote Santucci in one post. “We dropped the ball here,” he said in another post. “This is an inexcusable mistake. We’re extremely sorry for the inconvenience caused.”

Logitech is already offering patches for both apps that include an updated certificate. But unfortunately for users, one of the features broken by the expired certificate is the app’s built-in updater, meaning that there’s no automated way for Logitech to fix this problem. Anyone who wants their apps to work and their customizations to return will need to manually grab the patch (or updated versions of the apps, which Logitech says it is also working on). If you use both apps, each will need to be patched separately.

Users who install the app update should find that their settings and customizations are as they were before the outage, at least as long as they didn’t uninstall the app first while they were trying to get it to work.

“The patch will not affect the settings, but some users, prior to installing the patch, as part of troubleshooting, often uninstall/reinstall the app trying to get it to work and lose settings,” reads Logitech’s FAQ page about the issue. “So we recommend only using the patch installer.”

The patch works with the last four versions of macOS: macOS 13 Ventura, macOS 14 Sonoma, macOS 15 Sequoia, and macOS 26 Tahoe. Fixes for older macOS versions “will be made available at a later time.” (But if you’re still running a macOS version that old and you can update to macOS 14, 15, or 26, you should do it—those are the only versions Apple is currently supporting with security and Safari updates.)</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">SteamOS’s slow march across the Windows-dominated PC gaming landscape is continuing to creep along. At CES this week, Lenovo announced it will launch a version of last year’s high-priced, high-powered Legion Go 2 handheld with Valve’s gaming-focused, Linux-based OS pre-installed starting in June. And there are some intriguing signs from Valve that SteamOS could come to non-AMD devices in the not-too-distant future as well.

A new SteamOS-powered Legion Go 2 isn’t exactly shocking news given how things have been going in the world of PC gaming handhelds. Lenovo became the first non-Valve hardware maker to embrace the Windows alternative when it announced a SteamOS-compatible version of the lower-end Legion Go S almost exactly a year ago. When that version hit the market last spring, Ars testing found it actually performed better than the Windows-based version of the same hardware on many popular games.

Valve has also been working behind the scenes to expand SteamOS’s footprint beyond its own hardware. After rolling out the SteamOS Compatible software label last May, SteamOS version 3.7 offered support for manual installation on AMD-powered handhelds like the ROG Ally and the original Legion Go.

Adding the upgraded Legion Go 2 to that list will give those preferring SteamOS an option to buy in to beefier, pre-built handheld hardware without crafting their own Steam Machine from component parts. Like its Windows-based cousin, the new Legion Go 2 will come equipped with a Ryzen Z2 Extreme processor (like the ROG Ally X), 32GB of LPDDR5X memory, and an 8.8-inch 1920×1200 OLED screen. It has a hefty starting price of $1,199.

Even as SteamOS slowly spreads across the AMD-powered hardware landscape, the OS continues to be limited by a lack of compatibility with the wide world of Arm devices. That could change in the near future, though, as Valve’s upcoming Steam Frame VR headset will sport a new version of SteamOS designed specifically for the headset’s Arm-based hardware.

Over time, Valve sees that kind of support expanding to other Arm-based devices, too. “This is already fully open source, so you could download it and run SteamOS, now that we will be releasing SteamOS for Arm, you could have gaming on any Arm device,” Valve Engineer Jeremy Selan told PC Gamer in November. “This is the first one. We’re very excited about it.”

It’s an especially exciting prospect when you consider the wide range of Arm-based Android gaming handhelds that currently exist across the price and performance spectrum. While emulators like Fex can technically let players access Steam games on those kinds of handhelds, official Arm support for SteamOS could lead to a veritable Cambrian explosion of hardware options with native SteamOS support.

Valve seems aware of this potential, too. “There’s a lot of price points and power consumption points where Arm-based chipsets are doing a better job of serving the market,” Valve’s Pierre-Louis Griffais told The Verge last month. “When you get into lower power, anything lower than Steam Deck, I think you’ll find that there’s an Arm chip that maybe is competitive with x86 offerings in that segment. We’re pretty excited to be able to expand PC gaming to include all those options instead of being arbitrarily restricted to a subset of the market.”

That’s great news for fans of PC-based gaming handhelds, just as the announcement of Valve’s Steam Machine will provide a convenient option for SteamOS access on the living room TV. For desktop PC gamers, though, rigs sporting Nvidia GPUs might remain the final frontier for SteamOS in the foreseeable future. “With Nvidia, the integration of open-source drivers is still quite nascent,” Griffais told Frandroid about a year ago. “There’s still a lot of work to be done on that front… So it’s a bit complicated to say that we’re going to release this version when most people wouldn’t have a good experience.”</div>

            <h2>The Venezuela Polymarket Scandal Is Looking Really Bad</h2>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">As details emerge regarding the prediction betting scandal surrounding the US attacks on Venezuela, it’s becoming harder and harder to imagine any explanation other than the obvious: that an insider took advantage of nonpublic knowledge to make a quick buck.

Fresh reporting by the Wall Street Journal found that the anonymous bettor on Polymarket doubled down on their wager just five hours before over 150 US aircraft rocked the nation’s capital of Caracas. At least 80 civilians and military personnel have died from the US attacks, which satisfied the conditions of the anonymous bettor’s wager — netting them a cool $410,000.

What’s really astonishing is the timing of the bets placed. The WSJ breakdown shows just how close the mysterious insider came to the wire: on January 2nd, between 8:38 and 9:58pm, the bettor took out over $20,000 betting on an eminent attack on Venezuelan soil. At 10:46pm, president Donald Trump issued orders authorizing the military strike — not even an hour after the final bet had been placed.

At around 1:00am on January 3rd, explosions began to shake Caracas, destroying government buildings, civilian apartments, and even technical buildings at the Venezuelan Institute of Scientific Research. By 8:41am that same morning, the trader began to cash out their earnings — some $410,000, likely won at an unspeakable cost.

Making matters even more suspicious is the fact that the account was only one week old by the time the strikes hit, as political researcher Tyson Brody pointed out on social media.

Sure, it’s possible that someone registered a brand new account and made a series of unfathomably lucky bets, with no insider information, that just happened to pay off spectacularly.

But given the incredible timing, it also seems likely that the insider was someone either within the Trump administration or US armed forces — or someone else with advance knowledge of the attacks, like an employee at one of the media companies that knew about the administration’s plans before they happened, but chose not to report on them.

“It’s more likely than not that this was an insider,” Polymarket analyst Tre Upshaw told the WSJ. “That’s a lot of money to put in at that price, without a lot of news.”

As the WSJ notes, insider trading — placing profitable bets based on nonpublic information — is heavily regulated when it comes to the stock market, with major penalties for violations. When it comes to prediction markets like Polymarket, however, it’s the wild wild west, in part thanks to Trump’s own policy moves throughout his second term in office.

Earlier this week, Democratic representative Richie Torres introduced a bill which would penalize insider trading for all government officials on prediction markets, though the final vote remains a long way off — if it comes at all.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Months before it mysteriously vaporized into thin air, Elon Musk’s so-called Department of Government Efficiency ravaged the National Weather Service, leading to severe staffing shortages.

While the Trump administration promised to rehire most of the around 550 lost jobs at the agency last summer, effectively admitting that DOGE had gone too far, the agency’s offices across the country are still struggling with many roles that remain unfilled.

And given the latest blunder, those who remain are seemingly struggling to keep up — relying on flawed AI tech to come up with broken visuals for social media feeds.

As the Washington Post reports, the National Weather Service was caught posting an AI-generated weather map that hallucinated names for towns in Idaho.

A graphic forecasts “gusty south winds tonight” and shows a map that lays out the names of nonexistent towns, like “Orangeotilld” and “Whata Bod” — an unintentionally hilarious hallucination that sounds more like an old timey dirty joke than an actual place where people live.

The offending artwork was taken down on Monday, the same day WaPo notified the agency.

Experts say that the painful blunder could undercut trust in the agency and lead to confusion.

It also perfectly highlights the glaring shortcomings of AI tech that continue to lead to similar embarrassing incidents as the Trump administration pushes hard for the tech’s adoption by government agencies. Last month, for instance, it hired 1,000 specialists for a “Tech Force” to build AI.

But despite plenty of enthusiasm and resources being allocated to advancing the tech, baffling and easily avoided mistakes are falling through the cracks, as the latest incident goes to show.

It’s not even the first time a NWS office was caught posting lazy AI slop on social media. In November, the service in Rapid City, South Dakota, posted a map that included illegible location names, leading to widespread mockery.

The NWS told WaPo in a statement that using AI for public-facing content is uncommon, but technically not prohibited.

“Recently, a local office used AI to create a base map to display forecast information, however the map inadvertently displayed illegible city names,” NWS spokeswoman Erica Grow Cei told the newspaper. “The map was quickly corrected and updated social media posts were distributed.”

Cei added that “NWS will continue to carefully evaluate results in cases where AI is implemented to ensure accuracy and efficiency, and will discontinue use in scenarios where AI is not effective.”

But the damage has already been done. As flawed generative AI tools continue to be used carelessly, without the necessary follow-up work of checking for hallucinations, experts warn that agencies like NWS could inflict serious damage to their reputation and authority.

“If there’s a way to use AI to fill that gap, I’m not one to judge,” weather and climate communication expert Chris Gloninger told WaPo. “But I do fear that in the case of creating towns that don’t exist, that kind of damages or hurts the public trust that we need to keep building.”

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">In June 2025, Donald Trump Jr. proudly announced the founding of a mobile operator called Trump Mobile, including a mobile virtual network operator offering services for $47.45 a month, and a gaudy-looking, gold-colored, $499 smartphone that was supposedly going to be manufactured in the United States.

The device, as experts quickly pointed out at the time, looked an awful lot like a mid-tier Android phone from a Chinese smartphone company, drawing plenty of skepticism.

But despite promising that the phone would be released in 2025, the company was seemingly caught off guard by the dawn of a new year, with the Financial Times reporting on December 31 that Trump Mobile was delaying the launch of the handheld, dubbed T1, blaming the government shutdown. (How exactly the shutdown impacted the private business remains unclear.)

Beyond having embarrassingly little to show and failing to abide by its own deadlines, the company has walked back one of its biggest claims, a clear attempt to distinguish itself from its competitors. As the Associated Press points out, after announcing that the T1 would be made entirely in the US, the company’s website now claims the device will have an “American-proud” design — a meaningless tagline that makes it sound a lot like the device, if it ever gets made, will be built somewhere else.

It’s likely that Trump Jr. finally realized that producing a smartphone in the US could be far more expensive, making such a $499 device majorly unprofitable. That’s something we’ve known for quite some time now, as exemplified by Apple’s plans to move production of its US iPhones from China to India. The plans greatly angered his dad, president Donald Trump, who insisted it was possible to build iPhones in America by boosting domestic manufacturing by heavily taxing imports, forcing Apple to adjust its supply chains.’

Trump’s monetary policies and steep tariffs have driven up costs, making a US-built smartphone an even taller ask.

“The concept of making iPhones in the US is a nonstarter,” Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives said last year, estimating that a price tag for an iPhone could triple if made in the US.

In other words, Trump Mobile failing to live up to its promises since its founding last summer isn’t surprising in the least.

“We have always been quite skeptical about this phone,” International Data Corp. analyst Francisco Jeronimo told the Associated Press.

For the time being, Trump Mobile is slinging used iPhones and Samsung Galaxy smartphones for prices up to $630.

“Maybe they changed their strategy and figured out they are better off just selling refurbished phones,” Jeronimo added.

Nobody knows whether the T1 is pure vaporware — the company is still collecting $100 deposits — or a misguided attempt to cash in on Trump’s unsuspecting supporters, who may not be clued in to the fact that they could be investing in a middling foreign-made smartphone.

Besides, $500 gets you a pretty decent phone these days — without ostentatious gold and a close affiliation with a president who has a decades-long track record of launching and sinking well over a dozen businesses.

            <div id="article-text">The tech industry’s insistence on cramming AI into virtually every aspect of their consumer-facing offerings, from AI apps you can’t uninstall to hallucinating assistants that nobody asked for, has been nothing short of insufferable.

Tech enthusiasts and average consumers alike have watched helplessly as software and hardware they rely on to research, work, game, and keep in touch have turned into testing grounds for unproven AI tech — often without their consent.

Tech giant Microsoft has been at the epicenter of the resulting blowback, bearing the full brunt of the rage felt by many fed up with having AI shoved down their throat. It’s inundated its Windows 11 operating system with annoying AI features following the company’s doubling down on what it calls the “AI PC” last year, frustrating countless users, and most recently spawning the pejorative of “Microslop.”

Thankfully, vendors are finally starting to pay attention. As PCGamer reports, Windows PC maker Dell admitted at this year’s CES that things have really gotten out of hand.

Their executives are willing to say the quiet part out loud — that nobody is scrambling to buy an “AI PC.”

“One thing you’ll notice is the message we delivered around our products was not AI-first,” Dell’s head of product, Kevin Terwilliger, said during a pre-CES briefing, as quoted by the publication. “So, a bit of a shift from a year ago where we were all about the AI PC.”

“We’re very focused on delivering upon the AI capabilities of a device — in fact everything that we’re announcing has an [neural processing unit] in it — but what we’ve learned over the course of this year, especially from a consumer perspective, is they’re not buying based on AI,” he admitted. “In fact I think AI probably confuses them more than it helps them understand a specific outcome.”

It’s a notable change of tune, suggesting a promising sea change in the perspective of tech manufacturers. It’s a refreshing new perspective after years of companies promising us that all we needed in life was a little bit more AI.

But whether the company developing the operating system of Dell’s PCs will agree with the assessment that consumers ahve had enough remains to be seen.

In a rambling year-end post on LinkedIn, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella took umbrage with the term “slop,” arguing that “[w]e need to get beyond the arguments of slop vs sophistication.”

Nadella fumed that the company’s tripling down on AI will continue to be a “messy process of discovery, like all technology and product development always is.”

Indeed, tech companies like Microsoft and Dell have a lot still to prove until they can realize on their lofty promises about what AI can do.

For now, many new AI features remain infuriatingly useless, making us wonder if all of the risk and frustration will eventually be worth it in the end.

The fact that Dell is worried its AI-first approach may be hindering it from reaching new customers and making new sales, though, is telling.

Beyond Terwilliger’s eureka moment, Dell also admitted at CES that killing off its much-beloved line of XPS laptops was a mistake, officially reviving it for 2026 — and judging by the elated reactions the move has garnered, it was likely the right move.

Now, if only the hype surrounding AI hadn’t caused an astronomical rise in PC component prices…

            <div id="article-text">Fears over a growing AI bubble that could wipe out the entire economy if it were to burst continue to mount.

For many months now, investors and even tech leaders have openly been discussing the possibility — but if or when such a collapse could take place remains a subject of heated debate.

Nonetheless, investors are already preparing for that type of major tech sell-off, the Financial Times reports. The reporting shows that plenty of fear and uncertainty remain over the untold billions of dollars being poured into wildly unprofitable AI ventures — a dynamic that’s seen AI companies’ valuations skyrocket to record heights, despite dubious prospects of ever turning a profit.

Some are pulling back on their investments in major tech stocks, while others are outright betting on eventual drops in share prices.

“Whether there are excesses… in the equity market on AI is no longer questionable, but to figure out which exact companies will be the losers and when this reckoning will happen is difficult,” fund management firm Amundi chief investment officer Vincent Mortier told the FT.

One investment fund, Blue Whale Growth, sold its Microsoft and Meta stock in the second quarter of last year, with chief investment officer Stephen Yiu telling the newspaper that “we are concerned about the return on investment in some cases, while some of the valuations are insane — especially in private markets.”

GQG Partners chair Rajiv Jain added that “AI’s massive cash burn remains elevated with very little profitability in sight.” His fund sold all of its Magnificent Seven — investor shorthand for Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Tesla, Meta Platforms, Microsoft, and Nvidia — holdings.

“Though we had less exposure to a few Mag 7 names throughout 2025, we exited our remaining positions by early November because the risks of an AI bubble blow-up are growing, in our view,” he said.

At the same time, many remain unafraid of an imminent collapse.

“We don’t believe that we are in a bubble,” BlackRock international chief investment officer Helen Jewell told the FT, “but investors should prepare for a bumpy ride in 2026.”

Despite plenty of concerns among investors, banks remain optimistic about future growth. Wall Street has predicted double-digit gains this year. The S&P 500 has surged a whopping 92 percent since October 2022, posting double-digit returns for three years in a row now.

“2026 should be another strong year for AI stocks, with capex likely to surpass expectations,” JPMorgan’s Dubravko Lakos-Bujas wrote in a memo.

Others are far more muted about the outlook. Three years on from OpenAI’s launch of ChatGPT, some are starting to wonder how long the enormous hype surrounding AI can continue to be sustained.

In a 2025 retrospective posted on Monday, Bridgewater hedge fund founder Ray Dalio warned that the tech market is “now in the early stages of a bubble.”

But a crash, some argue, may still be some ways away thanks to plenty of remaining excitement.

“A bubble likely crashes on a bear market,” Cetera Financial Group chief investment officer Gene Goldman told Bloomberg. “We just don’t see a bear market anytime soon.”

            <div id="article-text">Not everybody agrees that replicating the four-limbed, bipedal shape of a human should be replicated in robot form. For one, walking with two feet is inherently less stable than four, nevermind a set of wheels. Replicating the dexterity and fine motor skills of human hands also remains a major challenge.

In a modified approach, Boston Dynamics has clearly decided to loosen up some of the restrictions of the human form. During an on-stage demonstration at this year’s CES convention in Las Vegas, Boston Dynamics showed off the agility of its humanoid Atlas robot — albeit with an unnerving degree of freedom of movement that dispels the illusion of a human entity.

Key to the demo is that the robot features clever joints that allow for “continuous rotation.” In effect, its hips, wrists, and neck can swivel a full 360 degrees unimpeded.

After confidently strutting to the front of the stage, Atlas starts twisting its hands like a drill, rotating its head like the girl in “The Exorcist,” and even turning its entire torso around in a dizzying maneuver — a clear indication that Boston Dynamics isn’t planning to be boxed in by the limitations of human anatomy.

“There’s more to it than just copying nature,” Boston Dynamics CEO Robert Playter said during the announcement. “We can pick the best parts of what nature has to offer and do better in others.”

The demo was part of Boston Dynamics’ announcement of a production-ready version of its Atlas robot. The Hyundai-owned firm also announced a partnership with Google’s DeepMind to bring AI smarts to its bots as well.

The firm claimed that it’s already working on a robot that can be deployed in a car factory. The plan is to deploy it at Hyundai’s EV manufacturing facility by 2028.

However, pricing and an availability date for the six-foot-two, 200-pound robot have yet to be revealed.

Beyond spinning its head and hands around freely, Boston Dynamics has shown how Atlas can manipulate car parts and even perform slick breakdancing moves.

“Atlas is going to revolutionize the way industry works, and it marks the first step toward a long-term goal we have dreamed about since we were children,” Playter boasted on stage.

Yet many questions remain about the tech’s long-term viability. For one, not everybody agrees that they make the most sense when it comes to actually replacing human labor. Experts have also warned that humanoid robots could be the next financial bubble.

When or if bipedal robots will be the form factor of choice, particularly when it comes to industrial settings, remains a subject of debate.

“I think the question comes back to what are the use cases and where is the applicability of the technology,” McKinsey partner Alex Panas told NBC News. “In some cases, it may look more humanoid. In some cases, it may not.”

Judging by its latest demo, Boston Dynamics is playing it safe by taking some liberties.

            <p><strong>TechCrunch | 2026-01-08</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/07/ford-has-an-ai-assistant-and-new-hands-free-bluecruise-tech-on-the-way/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Ford is developing an AI assistant that will debut in the company’s smartphone app, before expanding to its vehicles in 2027, the company announced Wednesday at the 2026 Consumer Electronics Show. The company also teased a next-generation of its BlueCruise advanced driver assistance system that is both cheaper to make and more capable — ultimately leading to eyes-off driving in 2028.

Wednesday’s announcement was one of the only ones to come from a major automaker at CES, marking a sharp turnaround from the late 2010s when they dominated the show. And it wasn’t made at a flashy keynote event; rather, Ford discussed the news at a speaker session called “Great Minds” that was meant to “explore the intersection of technology and humanity.”

Ford says it digital assistant is hosted by Google Cloud and will be built using off-the-shelf LLMs, and the company is giving it deep access to vehicle-specific information. That means the assistant can answer high-level questions like “how many bags of mulch can my truck bed support?” But it also means owners will be able to ask for granular, real-time information like oil life.

The company is rolling the assistant out to its newly revamped Ford app in early 2026. A native, in-vehicle integration will come in 2027, though the company wouldn’t specify which models it’s prioritizing.

Ford didn’t go into great detail about what the in-car experience will look like, but it’s not hard to imagine the possibilities when looking at some of the more tech-forward automakers.

Just last month, Rivian showed off its own digital assistant sending and receiving text messages, handling complex navigation requests, and changing climate controls. Tesla has integrated Elon Musk’s chatbot Grok in its vehicles, which customers have used to generate on-the-spot sightseeing tours. Some of those capabilities may eclipse what Ford has in mind, but the automaker also has a full year to hammer out the in-car integration.

The new BlueCruise system teased on Wednesday is 30% cheaper to build than the current technology, according to Ford. It will debut in 2027 on the first EV to be built on the company’s low-cost “Universal Electric Vehicle” platform, which is expected to be a mid-sized pickup.

Ford is promising more with this next-generation BlueCruise system, including eyes-off driving in 2028. But it also claims the system will be capable of handling “point-to-point autonomy,” similar to what Tesla offers with its Full Self-Driving (Supervised) software. Rivian has also teased a point-to-point system coming later this year. All of these systems require the drivers to be ready to take control of the car at any moment.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">After leading General Catalyst’s seed strategy for years, Niko Bonatsos has departed the firm. Known for backing an IPO-hopeful Discord and the $10 billion startup Mercor, Bonatsos told TechCrunch he intends to launch a new early-stage VC firm alongside “friends.”

Bonatsos is the latest investor to leave General Catalyst, a firm that recently expanded beyond the traditional venture model. Over the last few years, General Catalyst unveiled a wealth management business, a strategy focused on PE-style AI roll-ups, and a Customer Value Fund (CVF), which provides late-stage startups with nondilutive financing secured by recurring revenue.

Other recent General Catalyst departures include Deep Nishar and Kyle Doherty, who co-led the late-stage ‘Endurance’ strategy, and Adam Valkin, who co-led the early-stage fund alongside Bonatsos and Trevor Oelschig, TechCrunch reported last year.

Unlike his former colleagues, who declined to comment about their departures, Bonatsos described his exit as a mutual decision, saying that his time at GC was an “awesome experience,” which provided many “learnings.”

Bonatsos said he has yet to choose a name for his new firm or begin fundraising. He declined to specify the size of his team, noting only that the individuals he is considering include founders and investors “at the top of their game.”

Some of the themes Bonatsos intends to pursue include backing young founders, a trend he claims to have identified several years ago, before it became popular in the industry. Indeed, many of the leading founders of the AI wave are young and include college dropouts like Mercor’s founder, Brendan Foody.

Bonatsos is also interested in investing in founders who are launching consumer businesses, a sector he views as “underappreciated” in a market saturated with enterprise-focused AI startups.

Although General Catalyst has transitioned into what it calls an “investment and transformation company,” it is continuing to make seed-stage bets. Last year, GC hired Yuri Sagalov, a former YC partner who also founded Wayfinder Ventures, to lead seed investing in the U.S.

The Google co-founder has begun reincorporating several of his business entities in Delaware, including his family office, Koop; his influenza research company, Flu Lab; his aviation company, Dynatomics; and his flying car startup, One Aero.

Page himself is reportedly no longer in the state, a source told Business Insider. The news comes after the billionaire reportedly told others he was looking to leave the state amid the proposed tax, which would impose a 5% tax on those with assets worth $1 billion. Other names who have spoken out against the ballot initiative include David Sacks, Palmer Luckey, and Alexis Ohanian.

            <p><strong>TechCrunch | 2026-01-07</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/07/yes-linkedin-banned-ai-agent-startup-artisan-but-now-its-back/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Over the past few days, several posts on LinkedIn and Twitter/X went viral after one of the most talked about AI companies in San Francisco suddenly vanished from LinkedIn: Artisan AI.

The company’s LinkedIn page, individual employee profiles, and posts from executives all displayed a “This post cannot be displayed” message.

The startup had been banned from the site, Artisan CEO Jaspar Carmichael-Jack confirmed to TechCrunch. However, after working with LinkedIn over the past two weeks — and addressing the social network’s concerns — Artisan is now being reinstated.

“Every startup inevitably has some kind of thing that comes back to bite them [from things] that they do early on,” Carmichael-Jack said.

Contrary to what the rumors in the viral posts said, LinkedIn did not ban the company because its AI agents were spamming users. LinkedIn did, however, object to the startup using LinkedIn’s name on its website and also alleged that the company was using data brokers who had scraped the site without permission, Carmichael-Jack said. Data scraping is a violation of LinkedIn’s terms of service.

Artisan AI is a graduate of startup accelerator Y Combinator and became one of San Francisco’s buzziest startups via its “Stop hiring humans” billboards posted around town. Artisan offers an AI agent it calls Ava that does outbound sales by finding and contacting potential customers. LinkedIn is famously precious turf for outbound marketing salespeople — both human and, increasingly, AI.

While a couple of LinkedIn users seemed to notice Artisan’s ban about a week ago, the posts and tweets about it really picked up steam this week.

Carmichael-Jack explained that LinkedIn’s “enforcement team reached out to us, and they basically restricted our accounts completely, so we disappeared from the platform whilst they were reviewing it, which was not ideal. But it was kind of funny, because once we were restricted, our lead flow suddenly started inching up every day. And I think it’s because, obviously, so many people were posting about it.”

As a founder who likes a good guerrilla marketing scheme, he joked, “I wish we’d done it on purpose.”

The truth was he was shocked to get an email from LinkedIn on Friday evening, December 19, right before the Christmas holiday. Carmichael-Jack described the team handling the ban as helpful and responsive, even if they were also anonymous and only reachable by email.

To appease LinkedIn, Artisan removed all mentions of LinkedIn from its website. It was using the name to compare some of its data features to LinkedIn’s. The CEO also got a crash course in third-party vendor verification, ensuring that his data partners were operating in compliance with LinkedIn’s policies.

While Carmichael-Jack is happy to be back on the Microsoft-owned social network, he downplayed how damaging being booted off would have been, saying very little of the data Artisan uses comes from the site. He’s also about to release a new version of the agent that is more autonomous and can use more channels for contacting prospects.

“We can work around anything. We’re launching dialing as a channel in a few months — outbound calling,” so if the LinkedIn ban could not have been reversed, “it wouldn’t be the end of the world,” he said.

Interestingly, LinkedIn isn’t a direct competitor. It did launch its first AI agent last year called Hiring Assistant, but it is focused on recruiting. Still, that LinkedIn went nuclear on Artisan could signal that a sales agent could one day be in its pipeline, too. LinkedIn did not immediately respond to TechCrunch’s request for comment.

In any case, Artisan’s very public banning can be seen as a warning for all agentic players looking for sources of data: Big Tech is watching.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">At CES 2026, Anthony Wood, Roku’s founder, chairman, and CEO, offered a hint about the future of the company’s newest streaming channel, Howdy, and its ambition to become a broader competitor in the market. Launched last August, the $2.99 per month streaming service offers ad-free access to library content, at a time when rival streamers are raising their prices.

“The opportunity for Howdy was — if you just look at what’s going on in the streaming world with streaming services, they’re getting more expensive. They keep raising prices, and they keep adding larger and larger ad loads,” Wood explained at the Variety Entertainment Summit at CES. “And so, the part of the market where it actually started — low-cost and no ads — is gone now. There’s no streaming services that address that portion of the market.”

The exec also suggested that Roku intends to bring Howdy to a broader market than just Roku customers, saying that while it started on Roku, the company “will take it off-platform as well.”

Asked to clarify offstage if that meant mobile apps, the web, and elsewhere, Wood told TechCrunch the company has not yet said where, specifically, it plans to bring Howdy, but that “we want to distribute it everywhere.”  That seems to suggest that Howdy could be an app that you one day load on any device, large or small. Wood declined to share subscriber numbers with TechCrunch, but said onstage, “I think if I just look at the market, it’s going to be a big streaming service.”

            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/07/openai-unveils-chatgpt-health-says-230-million-users-ask-about-health-each-week/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">OpenAI announced ChatGPT Health on Wednesday, which the company said will offer a dedicated space for users to have conversations with ChatGPT about their health.

People already use ChatGPT to ask about medical issues; OpenAI says that over 230 million people ask health and wellness questions on the platform each week. But the ChatGPT Health product silos these conversations away from your other chats. That way, the context of your health won’t come up in standard conversations with ChatGPT.

If people start chats about their health outside of the Health section, then the AI aims to nudge them to switch over.

Within Health, the AI might reference things you’ve discussed in its standard experience. If you ask ChatGPT for help constructing a marathon training plan, for example, then the AI would know you’re a runner when you talk in Health about your fitness goals.

ChatGPT Health will also be able to integrate with your personal information or medical records from wellness apps like Apple Health, Function, and MyFitnessPal. OpenAI notes that it will not use Health conversations to train its models.

The CEO of Applications at OpenAI, Fidji Simo, wrote in a blog post that she sees ChatGPT Health as a response to existing issues in the healthcare space, like cost and access barriers, overbooked doctors, and a lack of continuity in care.

While the healthcare system has its drawbacks, using AI chatbots for medical advice creates a new slew of challenges. Large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT operate by predicting the most likely response to prompts, not the most correct answer, since LLMs don’t have a concept of what is true or not. AI models are also prone to hallucinations.

In its own terms of service, OpenAI states that it is “not intended for use in the diagnosis or treatment of any health condition.”

The feature is expected to roll out in the coming weeks.

When a federal immigration agent shot and killed a woman in Minneapolis today, the details were fresh but the story was familiar. Once again, a law-enforcement officer had fired into a moving vehicle, even though experts on use of force, and many agencies’ rules, prohibit or discourage the practice as dangerous and ineffective.

The facts of the Minneapolis shooting are still emerging, but bystander videos and eyewitness accounts provide some sense of what happened. Federal agents are in Minnesota as part of an enforcement push as the Trump administration focuses on welfare fraud among Somali immigrants in the state. Video shows bystanders watching (and heckling) federal agents. A truck with flashing lights pulls up; the driver and a second agent jump out and rapidly approach a burgundy SUV blocking the road, and the driver appears to tell a woman to get out of her car. The SUV reverses briefly, then starts to move forward. A third officer then fires several shots. The car veers away before crashing.

According to a witness who spoke to The Minnesota Star Tribune, a doctor at the scene attempted to help the woman who was shot, but was kept away by federal agents. When an ambulance finally arrived, it was blocked from reaching her by law-enforcement vehicles, and paramedics had to reach her on foot. The woman has died.

An initial statement by Tricia McLaughlin, a spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security, appeared to be false in most of its key details, including claiming that “violent rioters” were at the scene and alleging that the driver had “weaponized her vehicle, attempting to run over our law enforcement officers in an attempt to kill them.” The available footage suggests that the driver may instead have been trying to flee. Many DHS claims about incidents between civilians and agents have been misleading or plainly false, and the Trump administration has sought spurious charges against anti-ICE protesters.

Residents and local officials reacted with outrage. An emotional Mayor Jacob Frey blasted the federal operation at a press conference. “To ICE—get the fuck out of Minneapolis,” he said. “We do not want you here. Your stated reason for being in this city is to create some kind of safety and you are doing exactly the opposite.”

Firing at a car like this is problematic as a matter of both law and practice. Under a 1985 Supreme Court ruling, police aren’t permitted to open fire on someone who is fleeing unless that person presents a serious danger to the officer or others. Justice Byron White wrote that “it is no doubt unfortunate when a suspect who is in sight escapes,” but “it is not better that all felony suspects die than that they escape.” (The driver in question here was not clearly under arrest, much less a felony suspect.) Prosecuting police who open fire is challenging, though, because prosecutors and juries tend to grant wide deference to officers who say they feared that they or others were in peril.

Shooting into moving cars is often a bad idea, though, even when it might be legally justified. Officers who fear they are in danger often miss their target—sometimes harmlessly, sometimes striking bystanders or other officers. “If you actually hit the driver and are successful, now you’ve got an unguided missile,” Geoffrey Alpert, a professor at the University of South Carolina and an expert on police use of force, told me in 2021. “It’s just as likely if you shoot someone that a foot’s going to go on the gas as on the brake.” In this case, photos suggested that the SUV struck another car after its driver was shot.

Because of this, many departments advise against opening fire on moving vehicles. Following a 1972 shooting, the New York Police Department adopted a policy that banned officers from shooting from or at moving vehicles unless the person in the vehicle was using or threatening deadly force, which did not include the vehicle itself. Many other agencies have since followed suit, and guidelines recommended by police organizations tend to concur.

Nonetheless, shootings at moving vehicles continue to happen frequently. Violations of departmental rules may draw internal discipline, but they’re not enforceable as a matter of law. Many officers subscribe to the idea that they’re better safe than sorry—or, as an expression goes, that it’s “better to be tried by 12 men than carried by six” pallbearers.

Experts also point to poor training as a common reason for these shootings. Though the identity and experience of the officer who opened fire today are not yet known, it should be one area of focus. As ICE and other border agencies scramble to add staff and to reach huge deportation quotas set by the White House, they have lowered standards and shortened training in the hopes of getting agents on the streets sooner—but untrained officers are more likely to make mistakes.

Tense relationships between state and local governments and the federal government will complicate the investigation into this shooting, which the FBI will reportedly lead in conjunction with the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension.

Governor Tim Walz, a Democrat, today accused DHS of “propaganda” and promised “accountability and justice.” Officers who kill civilians are seldom charged with crimes, and when charges are brought, officers are often acquitted, but Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison has shown a willingness to prosecute officers for violence, including securing the convictions of four Minneapolis police officers in the murder of George Floyd. A successful prosecution here might be even trickier.</div>

On this week’s episode of The David Frum Show, The Atlantic’s David Frum discusses the American seizure of Venezuelan dictator Nicolás Maduro and President Donald Trump’s deeply flawed thinking about Venezuelan oil. David argues that Trump’s worldview of exploitation and predation is likely to doom his ambitions in Venezuela rather than secure them.

David is then joined by the national-security analyst David Rothkopf to examine the U.S. military operation in Venezuela and the Trump administration’s alarming lack of a coherent plan for what comes next. Rothkopf explores what it means for a president to sideline or altogether ignore the National Security Council before launching a major military action. Together, Rothkopf and Frum speculate about possible outcomes of the Maduro operation that Trump appears not to have considered.

Finally, David closes with his thoughts on Rudyard Kipling’s “Recessional” and the poem’s warning about national boasting, overreach, and the perils of collective foolishness.

The following is a transcript of the episode:

David Frum: Hello, and welcome to The David Frum Show. I’m David Frum, a staff writer at The Atlantic. My guest today will be David Rothkopf: broadcaster, businessman, journalist, author, but for our purposes today, the preeminent historian of the National Security Council and the foreign-policy process in the United States, author of the 2005 book Running the World, a history of the creation and development of the National Security Council. And we’ll be talking about the breakdown of that kind of judicious, careful guiding of American policy under Donald Trump, the emergence instead of a kind of clown show of whim and unpredictability and not thinking things through that is responsible for whatever it is that the United States is doing in Venezuela and for so much that the United States is doing around the world.

My book this week will not be a full book; it will just be a single poem. The poem is “Recessional,” by Rudyard Kipling, and I’ll be discussing it after the discussion with David Rothkopf. I hope you’ll stay to join.

But before getting to the dialogue and the poem, some opening thoughts about the dramatic events of this week. The United States finds itself having committed some kind of military operation in Venezuela. Exactly what has been done and why and to what end remains extremely murky—many, many stories are being told. But the president has given us an insight into his own particular thinking, and although it seems almost unbelievable that a person could think in such a way, we need to take it seriously because this is the president of the United States, and probably, what is in his mind actually drove this much more than any of the better or more rational reasons we’re hearing from more subordinate people in his administration.

Donald Trump seized the dictator of Venezuela, Nicolás Maduro, is now flying him to New York to stand, apparently, trial because he has an idea that the United States can take the oil of Venezuela—notionally, the largest oil reserves in the world, although there’s a lot of question marks and doubts about how big those oil reserves really are, but he thinks that the United States can seize them and enrich itself. This has been a consistent theme of Donald Trump’s. His big criticism of the Iraq War, led by President George W. Bush, was that the United States failed to take Iraq’s oil, and now he seeks to correct that mistake by starting some kind of conflict, maybe war, with Venezuela in order to seize Venezuela’s oil.

It’s a reminder that while, Donald Trump is often advertised as a great business leader—people who liked him in 2016 said often, and even later, people said sometimes, he thinks like a businessman—Donald Trump does not think like a businessman. Donald Trump thinks like a Marxist. Donald Trump thinks that wealth is something that exists, that is the product of exploitation, and that it can easily be seized and redistributed by one person to another. And this is a false way of thinking, in my opinion, but it’s especially false when applied to natural resources and to oil.

There is nothing less natural than a natural resource, and especially not oil. Oil is the product of human investment, human knowledge, human labor, and all of those things have to be paid for, regardless of who is the sovereign over the territory and whether the oil is found. And Donald Trump’s idea, I mean, it’s factually wrong. However big the oil reserves are—and, again, don’t believe the headline, because a lot of that is hype—but however big the oil reserves are, everyone agrees: Venezuela’s oil sector is in terrible shape. It will take an enormous amount of investment to bring oil back onto line—and not just in the oil wells. You are going to need roads and pipelines to the places where the oil is found. You are going to need tankers to take the oil away. You’re going to need an electrical power grid in order to power the machines that run the oil extraction. You’re going to need all the human apparatus: You’re going to need schools because the workers have to be trained. You’re going to need courts because there are going to be disputes. Who is going to take a dispute about Venezuelan oil to a judge picked by the Maduro regime? There’s gotta be an apparatus of honest law enforcement, honest conflict resolution. There’s going to need to be proper internet; how is that to be developed? All of this will cost an enormous amount of money.

And after the investment is made, it has to earn a return, as we discuss with David Rothkopf today. The price of oil today, as I record this at the beginning of January, is in the high $50-a-barrel range. That’s a price at which many people in the oil business are barely breaking even. The United States is the largest producer of oil on Earth. It’s the largest producer of natural gas on Earth. It’s the largest exporter of natural gas on Earth. But it is a relatively high-cost producer, and at $58 or whatever it is, the number as I speak, many American producers find it difficult to break even, certainly to make a profit, a return on their investment. The idea that they would agree that the United States suffers from this terrible shortage of oil and we need to go around the world stealing and robbing in order to get more of it will strike a lot of them as far-fetched, that they must be taxed to pay for the cost of a military occupation in foreign aid.

But even after the oil is produced in Venezuela—should that happen, in the unlikely event—the United States can’t just appropriate it to itself. That oil has to meet other needs. Just one example: Venezuela is one of the largest sovereign debtors on Earth. That money is owed to many people, to Americans and Europeans who had their assets confiscated by the regime. But it has a big debt to China as well, measured in the billions of dollars. Is the United States, as the new imperial overlord of Venezuela, planning to default on all of those debts, some of them? And if it’s going to pay them, that’s going to have the first claim on this oil wealth that Donald Trump proposes to develop in Venezuela at God knows whose expense.

Donald Trump thinks of capitalism as the way its worst critics do, as a system of exploitation and predation and seizure and confiscation and redistribution, when, actually, what you would like to see any American president think—and maybe especially a Republican president—is to understand that markets are systems of cooperation. Markets are a system to entice people to part with their savings, to entrust their savings to some productive purpose, in hope of earning a return, of directing savings to their best and highest use, of finding ways to reduce costs and increase revenues through the application of human know-how to technical problems. This is what the free-market system in which we think we believe, in which I believe, should stand for.

But Donald Trump thinks, like its worst critics, that capitalism is about robbery. And rather than refute that argument, or rather than saying that’s an argument against capitalism, the way the socialists do, Since it’s a system of robbery, therefore, let’s try something else, he says, Since it’s a system of robbery, let us use the mighty armed forces of the United States, paid for by the taxes of the American people, to go around the planet robbing people so that I can deliver some windfall to the people who have paid for a breakfast table at Mar-a-Lago and have put poison in my ear about who I should rob first and who I should rob next.

As I say, it’s going to fail because the problem with this way of thinking is not just that it’s invidious, not just that it’s demeaning, not just that it belittles the extraordinary achievements of the free-market system that has made the wealth of the United States and the developed world together. It’s also false. It’s also just not going to work. The United States is on its way either to finding that it’s achieved nothing in Venezuela—and that may be not one of the worst outcomes. It’s kidnapped somebody, put him on trial. He’s a bad guy; maybe he deserves it. Maybe he’ll be convicted, maybe not. But anyway, no question he’s done a lot of bad things, and he oughta be held to account for them; that’s fine. But if they’re going to transform Venezuela, that is a big undertaking and one that the Venezuelans are going to have a large voice in, whether it succeeds or not, whether it’s received peacefully or not. It’s their country; they get a voice in what happens there. And when people are denied a voice, they can resist, and they will resist, often, with violence. That’s been the story of many imperial adventures all over the world, American and other peoples as well.

We need to have a better way of thinking about how wealth is produced and how energy wealth is produced than we are offered by the United States government. It just seems that we are being led by people who are, at best, childish and, at worst, robberlike in their attitude toward the economy, toward the planet. The United States is not a nation of robbers; it’s a nation of cooperators. It’s a nation that exports ideas of freedom; it doesn’t steal other people’s wealth and import it to the United States. There’s no shortage of wealth in this country. It’s the richest country ever in the history of the world. It doesn’t need to take somebody else’s portion that oughta be somebody else’s endowment, someone else’s heritage to build their wealth, and take it for Americans. If it would work, it would be a shame, and it’s not going to work.

Frum: David Rothkopf is a man of so many accomplishments that it is impossible to do justice to them all, yet potentially stingy to select only a few. But at the risk of being stingy, let me hit some highlights. David is the host of the Deep State Radio podcast, which has developed into a network of related programming on the [DSR] Network, of which he is the founder. He is the author of more than 1,000 articles, which appear these days most often at the Daily Beast. He was a managing director at Kissinger Associates, the consulting firm, and then founded a consulting firm of his own. He served in the Commerce Department of the Clinton administration, promoting international trade and commerce. He is the author of the book that inspired this discussion, Running the World: The Inside Story of the National Security Council and the Architects of American Power, published in 2005—in my opinion, the definitive history of the development of the central bureaucracy of national-security decision-making. He’s superbly qualified to discuss the topic of our program today, which is: Why is the Trump foreign-policy process such a clown show? And fittingly, as a man of the world, he is speaking to us from Paris.

So, David, let me set a stage for you and draw on your deep knowledge of the National Security Council and its history. The United States has undertaken this military operation in Venezuela. It has seized the former dictator and sent him to New York, where he will, apparently, stand trial, and a series of explanations are being offered for this action, which are pretty hysterically contradictory: that this is being fought to do justice; to curb drugs, to stop illegal immigration; to restore democracy to Venezuela, although we’re leaving the dictatorship regime intact; that it’s about oil.

An ominous possibility occurs to me that the reason there’s so many different explanations is not just that this administration doesn’t tell the truth—although they don’t—but actually, they never sorted out why they’re doing what they’re doing, because they’ve broken the mechanism for doing that, which is the National Security Council.

And last point: Trump appointed a national security adviser at the beginning of his administration, Michael Waltz. Waltz was separated from—Trump says it was a promotion—in May 2025, he was sent over to the United Nations. Supposedly, the job is being done by Secretary of State Marco Rubio, but that means, probably, no one’s doing the job at all.

So tell us a little bit about what the National Security Council is supposed to do and why it seems to be malfunctioning in this administration.

David Rothkopf: Well, the National Security Council has two main purposes. One is policy development, policy coordination, and the other is overseeing policy implementation. It’s been referred to in the past as the “policy hill.” You get all the agencies of the United States government working together to make some recommendations to a president, the president evaluates the recommendations, and then, when the president makes a decision about how to act, the same agencies use the same mechanisms to ensure that the implementation is consistent both with the president’s desires and the proposals, as they’ve been laid out.

Problem here is Donald Trump doesn’t really want recommendations. He doesn’t like expert perspectives. He doesn’t listen to expert perspectives. And, frankly, he doesn’t really want any filtering between his direction and the implementation of his guidance. And so the NSC, which has grown over the years from a smallish group in the Eisenhower and the Kennedy administration to, in the last couple administrations, an agency that was several hundred people in size, it’s now shrunk back down to 30 or 40 professionals, the size it was under Henry Kissinger in the ’70s. And, frankly, as you say, there’s nobody running it, really. The experts aren’t actually being listened to. And it’s kind of like the appendix—it’s a vestigial organ that is primarily there because it existed in prior administrations.

Frum: So it’s obviously confusing and a little suspicious when an administration can’t explain why it’s done a military action, which may have large consequences. But explain how it would be actually harmful to the interests of the United States that we don’t know whether this is about bringing an alleged malefactor to justice, whether it’s about curbing drug trafficking, whether it’s about curbing illegal immigration, whether it’s about bringing Venezuelan oil back to market, whether it’s about restoring Venezuelan democracy, or whether it’s about keeping the Maduro system intact but without Maduro at the top. Why does it matter that we don’t know what we’re doing and why?

Rothkopf: (Laughs.) Other than the fact on its face that if we don’t know what we’re doing, it could produce a problem; if we don’t have objectives, it produces a problem. But look, in a good advisory process, you’re gonna have people telling you things that may be salient, right, like it would be illegal to arrest Maduro. It would be illegal to invade Venezuela. It would be illegal to seize the oil assets of Venezuela. The oil assets of Venezuela will take many, many billions of dollars to restore to any kind of productivity. Although Venezuela has the largest oil reserves in the world, the oil that the country produces, a lot of that oil, is a dirtier kind of sulfuric oil that costs more to produce. That the United States didn’t really have the claims to that oil that the president asserted that we did. That, while we might get Maduro out, there are many factions in Venezuela who would press back against Trump, whether they do it immediately or they do it more slowly—there is the faction that was elected in the last election, including the Nobel [Peace] Prize winner [María Corina] Machado, who Trump apparently did not want to take over the country, because she had the audacity not to refuse the prize and step aside in favor of him getting it. But it’s not just the political factions even within Maduro’s own party. It’s not really clear that the army is lined up alongside the former vice president. The former vice president has some strange ties to Russia, which we’re not quite sure of. We’re not sure what the Russians will do. We’re not sure what the Iranians, who have close ties, will do, etc., etc., etc.

And so these are the kind of things that a president who is concerned about the long-term success of an operation might wanna know about and that Trump has just sort of swept aside, and even in the past 48 hours, every single one of these things has manifested itself as a potential problem for what comes next in this operation.

Frum: Well, you allude to one, which is the most obvious pressing problem, the biggest one, which is: Trump has this fantasy that he’s somehow going to save money by stealing other people’s oil, with no idea that, first, stealing is not a route to wealth and riches, and this oil is going to be very, very expensive. And by the way, it’s Venezuela’s oil, so if they do succeed with not billions, but hundreds of billions of dollars of investment, because you have to invest not just in the oil wells, but in the roads, in the electrical system to supply the power to get the oil out of the ground—it’s a big, big investment; that has to come from somewhere—Venezuela already has a giant sovereign debt.

So they haven’t thought any of these things through. And as you say, one of the things that may happen is, they’ve brought Maduro in front of an American court; it’s not clear that he won’t be able to come up with defenses in front of an American court. What happens if he’s acquitted? Has anybody thought about that?

Rothkopf: Well, I don’t know that they have thought about it, and of course, there are a lot of reasons that he might be acquitted. The court might say it doesn’t have jurisdiction. The court might say he was illegally kidnapped from the country. The court might take issue with some of the points in the indictment. Part of the case against Maduro is that he’s the head of a so-called or alleged cartel called the Cártel de los Soles, which isn’t actually a cartel; it doesn’t actually exist. It’s a little like antifa. It’s kind of a zip code for a bunch of alleged bad actors. Who knows how well the case has been put together. We’ve seen a lot of cases put together by the Trump Justice Department falling apart because they’ve been mishandled from a legal perspective.

So that could happen, but just to go back to your other point, there are stories now coming out that oil companies are a little reluctant to go in and take on the task of the spending of the tens or hundreds of billions of dollars it’s gonna take to restore the Venezuelan oil industry. There are a lot of reasons for that. One is that hundreds of billions of dollars is a lot of money, but another is there’s no assurance that the next government of Venezuela is not gonna come in and say, This stuff was illegally seized; we want it back, and that you could go and spend hundreds of billions of dollars, and the day after you’re finished, the Venezuelan government go, It’s not yours anymore, buddy, and they’d have a pretty good case.

Frum: Well, there’s another, which is oil is trading right now at approximately $58 a barrel. And if you’re an oil company, say, the price is low right now; I’m barely breaking even. If I have a hundred billion dollars to invest, I’m not sure I want to invest my money in oil. And if I’m going to invest my money in oil anywhere, I’m going to invest it in the United States or Canada, where it’s safe. And with the United States being the largest oil producer in the world, North America producing 28 percent of the world’s oil supply, why wouldn’t you say, Let’s just spend a small amount of money and put it in Texas and all go to stay in nice hotels in Houston, rather than the Orinoco jungle? (Laughs.)

Rothkopf: Right, but also particularly if that jungle’s filled with guerillas or other people who are saying, This isn’t your oil, and they’re blowing up things along the way. But think about how this is gonna sit with Trump’s friends in the Gulf or Trump’s friends in Russia, who are all in the oil business, and if he comes and brings this oil onstream, and the price of oil goes down further and further, and they get further and further away from their break-even point, it’s gonna be bad news for them.

And also, does Trump wanna enter into OPEC? (Laughs.) Is that the future for U.S. energy policy? Whatever Trump may be doing, the rest of the world has come to the conclusion that alternative forms of energy are cleaner and safer and also cheaper, and so he may wanna perform mouth-to-mouth resuscitation on the fossil-fuel sector, but he may not be able to pull that off either.

Frum: Okay, so you identified some problems here, and this is what interagency processes exist to do—and not always to say no, but just to say, Mr. President, have you thought about your scheme to steal oil? None of us, of course, will criticize that because you are the president, but it may turn out to be a money loser. Your scheme to seize and abduct this bad actor in Venezuela—we all agree he’s a bad actor—and bring him to trial in New York: He might be convicted; he might sue you afterwards if he is acquitted. (Laughs.) There might be a lawsuit from the Maduro family about unjust detention. Have you thought about that? Have you thought about thing X, Y, and zed? There’s a process to think about that, and that’s the thing that’s broken, that we’re missing.

The United States has tried, at various points in the past, to do without a national security adviser—most famously, Henry Kissinger, like Marco Rubio, was simultaneously secretary of state and national security adviser at the same time. Tell us a little bit about how the Henry Kissinger experiment worked or didn’t work, bearing in mind that it’s Henry Kissinger, a person of extraordinary talent.

Rothkopf: Well, but Henry Kissinger was an active adviser who sought to be the primus inter pares among the advisers, as opposed to a president who doesn’t wanna listen to any advisers. But Kissinger did this power play, so he ran the NSC and the State Department at the same time—

Rothkopf: It was during the Nixon and the beginning of the Ford administration. And I spoke to Ford in doing one of my books, and he said the single most important thing he did was to put Brent Scowcroft in charge of the National Security Council and break the job up so that it was not all Henry Kissinger.

And that goes to one of the core points, right? When you have advisers, you wanna have multiple points of view; Kissinger wanted the president to have one point of view. And Ford wanted a little bit more fair play among his advisers, and Scowcroft, the only man to serve as national security adviser twice, had a big advantage in that he was seen as—the term of art that has emerged—as an “honest broker,” right? He was seen as the guy who would present all the viewpoints of the Cabinet to the president so the president could fairly decide among them. And of course, Scowcroft did this then again for George H. W. Bush and was seen as the model for doing it right, precisely because he had lived through the period when it was being done wrong.

Frum: Well, Scowcroft, an Air Force general, career military, was an intensely self-effacing man but who had a great ability to develop intimate relationships with the presidents he served, relationships of trust. But what happened—and correct me if I have this wrong—Kissinger was doing both jobs. He was a national security adviser, first and foremost, who also happened to occupy the State Department, a bureaucracy he disliked and distrusted, and he was trying to neutralize the State Department so they didn’t get in the way of his National Security Council. That was his main job.

What seems to be happening with Rubio, who is both secretary of state and, theoretically, national security adviser, is he’s just being secretary of state and no one’s being national security adviser, because the deal that seems to have been struck in, at least based on what I read in the funny papers, is that Rubio gets to run Latin American policy and some other things as well. Trump is running Russia and Ukraine policy himself, with the aid of some people—Steve Witkoff and other people. And so the deal for Rubio’s power is, if he agrees to accept that he’s in charge only of part of the world, he can be both secretary of state and not have to worry there’s some national security adviser who’s going to circumvent him. But there isn’t someone doing that job of bringing everything in front of the president, including such basics as Maduro might be acquitted.

Rothkopf: There are a few things I would take issue with in the characterization. First of all—

Rothkopf: —Kissinger was attracted to the prestige of the office of secretary of state, moved his office over to the State Department, had some of his closest aides doing the work for him in the State Department. He was trying to negate voices that contradicted his voice, but he later would complain that by moving his office out of the West Wing primarily—or some of the time out of the West Wing—that diminished his influence. And he famously said to me that, in the policy world, like in real estate, what matters most is location, location, location, and being down the hall from the president mattered a lot.

Rubio’s deal is, technically, as you describe it, except in reality, what’s emerged is this: Witkoff is the secretary of state for Ukraine and Russia. Witkoff is the secretary of state for the Middle East. China policy is now being run by, of all people, Stephen Miller, who is the deputy White House chief of staff for domestic affairs but also happened to be lurking in the background during the press conference we saw on Saturday and has an oversized role in the administration.

And I think it’s important to remember that, even with this division of the world—and, by the way, Rubio’s also the head of USAID and the archivist of the United States, by the way, just to throw that into his portfolio—but Trump doesn’t take anybody’s advice. And so, even in this case, it is being reported that, in the wake of this carefully planned military operation on Saturday, Trump walked out, said, We’re gonna run Venezuela. And then somebody said, Well, who? And he said, Well, these people up here on the stage. And Rubio has spent the past couple of days backing off of that because there was no plan to run Venezuela. This was the president improvising. And there still is no plan to run Venezuela. Rubio’s trying to say, Well, the way that we’re gonna do it is that we have influence, and we can stop oil flows, and the military will threaten them, and that’s how we are going to exert our power. But of course, that’s not how you run a country.

Even in the past when the United States has gone in on oil wars or trying to do nation-building, we’ve had a terrible track record even when it was extremely well planned. And in this particular case, they are just riffing, making stuff up, and mostly kind of cleaning up on Aisle Trump. Trump will say something, and these people then have to scramble behind him to clean up the mess.

Frum: Well, there are millions of refugees, or exiles, from Venezuela, many of them in Colombia, other Latin American countries, some in the United States. Not only Americans, but many of Venezuela’s neighbors would like to see those people go home. Many of those people would like to go home. They’re needed at home. What’s the plan to get petroleum engineers back to Venezuela to help their country?

Rothkopf: On the one end, Trump has said in the past day, Well, I’ve talked to the oil companies. They’re eager to do it. We’re gonna leave it to our great American oil companies to handle that. Of course, the oil companies have a different story. A part of the problem goes back to what you’re talking about is the core issue here, which is: Trump has one reason for doing what he is doing, which is oil. Rubio has another reason for doing what he’s doing, which is sort of he’s from a Cuban American family; he’s got a long-standing bone to pick with Cuba. He certainly wanted to go after Venezuela ’cause of its ties to Cuba. Of the scores of people who were killed in this operation, by the way, a bunch of them were Cuban military. Taking the oil away from Cuba, the revenue that goes through Venezuela away from Cuba, could put pressure on Cuba. So Rubio has a slightly different agenda. Obviously, the Justice Department and the people involved in drug interdiction have another agenda. Stephen Miller and the people involved in refugees and immigration have yet another agenda. And none of that stuff is being coordinated, and none of the conflicts are being worked out.

If I may, one additional thing: In the course of the presidential press conference on Saturday, or the past 48 hours, the president and his aides have also sequentially threatened the president of Colombia, who Trump said needs to “watch his ass”; the president of Mexico, who Trump said did not control Mexico, and he was gonna have to go after the cartels; the government of Cuba, which Rubio said he’d be worried if he was in the government of Cuba; and the government of Denmark and all of NATO because Trump said, Yeah, we need Greenland, and we’re going after Greenland.

And so yet another set of issues that you might get discussed in a normal policy process is: Well, what happens if it’s not just one illegal takeover and the chaos that causes, the unintended consequences? What if it’s four? What happens with all of that as your alliances are blowing up, and the price of oil is blowing up, and drug cartels are waging war against the U.S. government, and so on and so forth. So they are unleashing a lot of problems out of the Venezuelan Pandora’s box, and nobody has thought through what the consequences may be.

Frum: Well, one of the things that you would think in a policy process would happen is somebody would say to President Trump, It’s true that the present president of Colombia is an unhelpful person, and many people in Colombia would head the queue to say it. But he is leaving power in 2026. Colombia has been a longtime, very faithful security partner of the United States against both drugs and terrorism. There’s probably, after May of 2026, going to be a Colombian president much more willing to cooperate with the United States. That’s where the largest group of Venezuelan exiles are. If you can just keep your mouth shut until May, Colombia’s going to be a, potentially, extremely crucial partner. And when you say things like, Our American oil companies are going to solve the oil problem in Venezuela, first, that’s a fantasy. But second, everyone else will say, I guess that means your European Union allies are off the hook for any reconstruction expenses—because Trump, with his predatory attitude, thinks he’s gonna steal a lot of money. In fact, Venezuela, should there be a true regime change, not just a swap of one dictator for another, but a true transition to something democratic, Venezuela’s going to need a lot of help. And maybe down the road at some point, they will be self-sufficient because of oil, if the world is still using oil in the 2030s and 2040s. By [in] the 2020s, they are going to have needs, and is the United States signing up to meet all of those needs? Because if you exclude your partners, you’re also saying the bill falls entirely on the American taxpayer.

Rothkopf: Yeah, and, again, geopolitics is about knock-on effects, right? Fiona Hill, six years ago or seven years ago now, talked about how there was a perception in the Russian government that maybe a swap could be done where Russia could get Ukraine and the United States could have Venezuela. And there are going to be connections between whatever America’s Venezuela policy is and whatever might happen in Ukraine on several levels, and one of them is if the U.S. is involved in a big rebuilding effort here, which might happen, how much can we spend on a big rebuilding effort in Ukraine?

If we wanna have our way in this hemisphere, how much leeway are we gonna give the Russians or, parenthetically, the Chinese for having their way in this hemisphere? If we decide we’re gonna take Greenland as part of this whole thing, and we alienate all of NATO, which we are trying to have bear the burden of the issues in Ukraine, what is the consequence of all of that gonna be? And so on, and so on, and so on.

And by the way, if you go after the Colombians and you go after others in Latin America and you trigger, among at least some of the countries of Latin America, a desire to move together and counterbalance the United States, what happens when they say to the Chinese, You know something. We’d rather deal with you. We’re gonna sanction the U.S.? China’s already the No. 1 investment partner and the No. 1 trading partner of almost every country in the Americas, South America. What happens when they open the door more to China? We’ve seen that in a country—and I’d be interested, frankly, in what you have to say about this, that you’ve written better about than a lot of the people out there and almost anybody out there—and that is another of the countries mentioned in the past 48 hours by Trump: Mexico.

Trump has said some really outrageous stuff about Mexico and saying that President [Claudia] Sheinbaum [Pardo] is not actually in charge of Mexico; the cartels are in charge of it, and he’s gonna have to go in and clean up the cartels—well, Mexico’s one of our top trading partners, top trading partner of China, deeply involved in all the immigration issues we have to deal with, has a lot of other issues with the U.S. What happens if he alienates one of our closest partners in the world, not to mention your native Canada?

Frum: Yeah. Well, the Mexico part worries me a lot. It’s not wrong that there are large parts of Mexican territory where the authority of the Mexican state does not govern and where cartels are in charge. That is an enormous problem. That’s not something to use as an argument. That’s something that both countries should be very, very worried about. And Claudia Sheinbaum, although she comes from the Mexican far left and comes from an anti-American ideological tradition, has, in fact, worked with the Trump administration to an almost politically self-endangering degree. Her approach to Trump has been total appeasement. And the United States is flying drones over Mexico, which they originally did, I think, without Mexican knowledge or permission; they got the knowledge or permission after the fact. The drones are supposedly unarmed, but who knows whether that’s true. And there are a lot of people in the Trump administration who wanna—including Stephen Miller, whom you mentioned, and the vice president, who are on record as calling for American unilateral military strikes inside Mexico, with or without the consent and knowledge of the Mexican authorities.

The danger here is that you collapse the Mexican state because—

Rothkopf: Well, it’s also not the first time that Trump’s done this. And Trump, during the last Trump administration, floated the idea of shooting at Mexico, launching missiles at Mexico. And it took the secretary of defense at the time, the head of Homeland Security at the time to say, No, Mr. President, you can’t actually attack Mexico, but he doesn’t have people who will say that to him this time. And that’s what makes this pretty scary.

Frum: Let’s talk about how the National Security Council might have worked. One of the things I was really struck by was this new National Security Strategy, which theoretically emanates from the national security adviser, although, again, there isn’t one. There is an archive of all the past reports—I won’t pretend I’ve read all of them. I noticed there were seven issued by the Clinton administration, which is a lot; normally, it’s one to an administration, or so it seems. So I read the one from Trump 1, from Biden, and then from Trump 2.

So the one from Biden is just a giant blurry committee report, obviously written by—no single person [who] could write anything this dull; it took a team of highly trained professionals. (Laughs.) And it’s mostly about not saying anything that’s untoward in any way, so that’s not very useful.

Trump 1 was a basically normal document; it was issued by National Security Adviser H. R. McMaster. Some spicy jalapeños in it, but basically pretty normal.

This one reads like it’s written by people working for a very right-wing college magazine. It’s just—

Rothkopf: Or the Kremlin. Because the core concept behind this last National Security Strategy is the idea of viewing the world through this idea of spheres of influence, which is this Putin-esque idea, which is, essentially, bully states get to determine what happens near them. And so Russia can have Ukraine; China can have Taiwan; the United States can have whatever it wants in the Caribbean, Central and South America. And Trump has really bought into that idea. Within the document, there is the so-called Trump Corollary to the Monroe Doctrine—I’d love it if somebody asked Trump who [President James] Monroe was, ’cause I’m pretty sure he doesn’t know. But Trump does like the fact that people are now referring to it as the “Donroe Doctrine,” which is—I think people are making fun of him, but he doesn’t realize this. And he made a reference to it during the press conference. And the Donroe Doctrine essentially is: We not only will defend our hemisphere; it’s that we wish to dominate our hemisphere.

Frum: That’s not even new. There was a thing called the Roosevelt—meaning Teddy Roosevelt—Corollary to the Monroe Doctrine. And Teddy Roosevelt asserted a right of the United States to use the Monroe Doctrine to intervene in the affairs of the smaller nations of the Caribbean and the north shore of South America, although Roosevelt himself was not an enormous interventionist; he seized Panama from Colombia, or encouraged a revolution in Panama against Colombia. But under his next successors, under [President William Howard] Taft and then [President Woodrow] Wilson, the United States—and under [Presidents Warren G.] Harding and [Calvin] Coolidge as well—became a very aggressive military presence all over the Caribbean.

So that was tried for a third of a century, and it led to a lot of pretty catastrophic results. It was also expensive. So Franklin [D.] Roosevelt’s Good Neighbor policy was a repudiation of the Teddy Roosevelt Corollary to the Monroe Doctrine, so we’re not doing this anymore. We are going to support friends, but we’re not going to use direct American military intervention, except in the most extreme circumstances in this hemisphere.

Now, again, there are deviations: [President] Lyndon [B.] Johnson in the Dominican Republic and some pretty nasty, and usually counterproductive in the long run, CIA interventions. But this Donroe Doctrine was originally tried by Teddy Roosevelt and tried, tested, rejected.

Rothkopf: Yeah, and, again, it comes out of that period of history where [William] McKinley, a president Trump really likes, was flexing the United States imperial muscle for the first time. But it was quite limited, and typically, throughout that period, we were looking for certain kinds of justification for what we are doing, which we are not really doing under Trump, although it is important to note, as you did, that this period did exist and that a lot of what we were doing in that part of the world was on behalf of U.S. companies—not oil companies at the time, but, for example, banana companies in Central America. And it really rubbed the American military the wrong way that they were being sent off to fight wars in these countries on behalf of American corporate interests.

And you start to see the rumblings of that here. And I think this is gonna be a source of some of the pushback that Trump is gonna get here. And of course, this is anything but America First policy, and it is already starting to alienate many in Trump’s base—which, by the way, is something that a policy process would, in a parallel process, address among perhaps the political advisers to a president, and that isn’t happening either.

Frum: Yeah. When we talk about that document, the security strategy, as blurry as some of them have been, like the Biden document, they’re an exercise in saying, Means and ends need to be brought into harmony. So here are a bunch of things you want in the world. Here are the means that the political process will accept that you use, both in terms of expense and in terms of trouble, and in terms of reputational risk. So let’s try to bring them into some kind of harmony. And that means we have to have some definition of priorities: what’s most important, what’s must-have, what’s good to have, what we can live without. The United States wants—or used to want—to bring more democracy and more human rights to more places, but it can’t do all places all the time at once. There are better opportunities in some places. There’s more demand. There are more effective partners. So can we work in a coordinated way?And that whole project of bringing means [and] ends into harmony seems to be jettisoned. I think even the Kremlin has made some effort to bring means into harmony with ends. That’s why I said it read like something from a right-wing school paper. It’s called a “strategy”—it didn’t do the strategic work of thinking, What are we trying to accomplish? How do we do it? What means do we have available? If you’re trying to assert a greater American residence in this hemisphere, what are you trading away? Who’s going to help you? How much will you spend? How big a commitment are the American people willing to expend to get American oil concessions in Venezuela? (Laughs.) And the United States is the world’s largest oil producer, and the oil companies are barely breaking even on the oil they make here.

Rothkopf: Yeah, well, and another subset of the issues associated with what you’re talking about here that has been central to U.S. foreign policy, including in oil wars of the past that you may remember well, is: What about our allies? What about the rest of the international system? In the past, particularly in the first Gulf War, the United States really went to some lengths to put together a kind of international coalition because they felt that that was adding legitimacy. That takes a lot of work. The diplomacy involved in it, as you know, is extremely complicated, involves lots of work by different agencies. All the countries have different issues involved and so forth. Trump has just tossed that aside as well. He does not really care what anybody else in the world thinks about us. Even at our most unilateral, in the George W. Bush administration, there was at least some discussion about it. There is no discussion about it.

Frum: In the Iraq War of 2003, there was a big international coalition, many, many partners: Britain, Spain, Poland, others—I think Ukraine was there, if I remember right.

But this gets to a point that I think I now am reproaching myself for not having raised earlier, because one of the things that people need to understand about the National Security Council is it’s not a body of mandarins who spend their careers on the National Security Council. There are some, but mostly, it is people who are secunded from other agencies of the government. So if you’re a president who thinks, I’m worried about climate disaster as a national-security threat, you bring in lots of people from agencies with those expertises. If it’s 2008, 2009, and you’re worried about international debt crisis, you bring in people from the Treasury. And they serve on the National Security Council, although their salaries are paid by Treasury or whatever other agency, and that gives you this kind of breath of circulating air. And it means, among other things, that you’re very likely to have people who have served in other countries,, especially in the military, but [also] in diplomatic services and other services, may speak foreign languages, may have contacts. And at the center, there is a way to not succumb to this building syndrome, but to actually have a wider view of the world, and if you break that, then all we’re hearing from are the interests of Trump’s donors, who are willing to spend money at Mar-a-Lago.

Rothkopf: Yeah, and there’s a corollary to that as well, which is that the Trump administration came in waging a war against what it called the “deep state,” which is the career professionals in all of these agencies, who have this huge amount of experience and a long history of putting the interests of the U.S. and the Constitution first. But Trump didn’t trust them; he wanted loyalists—not just in the White House, but in all of these agencies. In the national-security process, you would have the views of multiple agencies expressed, but before the agency said something in an NSC meeting, there were a bunch of meetings in the Pentagon or the State Department or the Commerce Department or the Treasury Department to develop a view internally there, and particularly in a giant agency like the Pentagon or an agency like the State Department, those discussions were often extremely wide-ranging, had a wide range of points of view.

Well, do you think that’s happening in Pete Hegseth’s Department of Defense? Of course it’s not. Because Pete Hegseth doesn’t trust people with differing views. Pete Hegseth is trying to suppress differing views. Even today, the day we’re recording this thing, Pete Hegseth has taken out after Mark Kelly, a senator, for having expressed a view from the Senate floor, which was well within his rights to express, saying, Oh, former military shouldn’t have separate points of view, and we’re gonna punish him by demoting him and reducing his pension. And he’s fired generals and admirals because they had different points of view. And so you’re getting not only the elimination of the NSC, but you’re getting an elimination of the processes within each agency that enriched the ultimate policy discussion.

We are having, essentially, on a remarkably fast, wide-ranging basis, a lobotomy being performed in the United States government at precisely the wrong moment because we have a president who is purely an impulse engine with no sense of history and who needs to be constrained by that kind of process, which he is eliminating.

Frum: Well, one thing that this process is supposed to do is, there needs to be somebody at the table who is there to ask the question, What if this doesn’t work out the way everyone here thinks it will? We all hope it will; we all hope it will all go fine. But what if it doesn’t? What if there is a guerilla resistance inside Venezuela? Have we thought about that? Do we have a contingency plan in case there is? Have we decided, whatever goal we are seeking—and we have four or five goals—will that goal seem worth it if we find ourselves eight months from now dealing with dead-end remnants of the Maduro regime who’ve taken weapons and gone into the jungle? Is there a history—yes, there is—of guerrilla resistance in Venezuela and Colombia? Do we wanna fight that?

And presidents have to take risks; they often have to be prepared to face the risk of the worst-case scenario. But they need to know what it is. They need to have someone there saying, Here’s what would happen if things go wrong. That’s the story of the Iraq War and the administration in which I served, was there was lots of planning, there was lots of thinking, but there was a refusal to take seriously, What if our hopes don’t come true? And the administration bet everything on best-case scenarios: You can do it with 110,000 troops. Resistance will collapse. The best-case scenarios turned out not to be true, not to happen; the worst-case scenarios happened. And no one had ever asked the question, Would we do this if the worst-case scenario were a realistic possibility? And the answer to that is, often, Well, in that case, we probably wouldn’t. It isn’t worth it.

Rothkopf: There are, in the history of the NSC, which was created with the National Security Act of 1947, example after example of where the policy process let us down. In Vietnam, it let us down. In Central America, during the Reagan administration, it let us down. In the forever wars in the Middle East, it let us down. In some other areas that we might talk about, in climate policy or dealing with pandemics or whatever, it let us down. But it’s a whole heck of a lot better than nothing.

When we’re talking about the Bush 43 administration, looking at best-case scenarios, we’re not even looking at those. A best-case scenario takes you a few months down the road; we’re not looking a few months down the road. And so our experience is that no policy process is perfect, but the absence of a policy process is infinitely worse than the presence of even a flawed policy process.

Frum: That’s a great place to put a bookmark and to resume this conversation again. David, thank you so much for your time, for taking time away from your wonderful afternoon in Paris, so grateful to you. And I recommend to everybody: our book on the NSC is really an invaluable history of something that is, to many of us, a closed box, and you opened the box and helped us see both what the NSC is, what it was, how we came to this place—2005, as relevant as ever, Running the World. And I learned from it so much, and I think others will as well.

Rothkopf: Thanks very much, and it’s good to talk to you, David.

Frum: Thanks so much to David Rothkopf for joining me today on The David Frum Show. As I mentioned at the top of the program, my book this week is not a book; it’s just a single poem. And the poem is “Recessional,” by Rudyard Kipling.

You will know Rudyard Kipling as the great poet of British imperialism. He lived from 1865 to 1936. He’s gone very out of style because of his imperial message, but since the Trump agenda in South America seems so nakedly imperialistic—about seizing other people’s wealth and taking it for oneself—I thought it might be a moment to return to the poetry of imperialism and to hear sort of some warnings, even from Rudyard Kipling, about what it is the United States has undertaken.

Kipling was born in what is now India, in Bombay. He died in London. He lived for four years in the 1890s in the United States. He married an American woman and lived in Vermont. That’s where he wrote Jungle Book, which became the famous Disney movie—other stories too: Captains Courageous as well.

He could be vainglorious and boastful and show all the ugly face of race arrogance and national chauvinism. He’s probably most notorious for his line “the White Man’s burden,” which is a line from a poem he wrote actually congratulating the United States on his acquisition of colonies in the Philippines. But Recessional, which was written in 1897, in time for Queen Victoria’s 60th anniversary, her Diamond Jubilee, it also contains one of his most notorious lines, although this line is widely misunderstood. The line is “lesser breeds without the Law,” which, you will hear, is not actually a statement of race arrogance but is a criticism of Britain’s Germanic opposite numbers during the arms race of the 1890s because he found them boastful and rude and arrogant. It was not an expression of racial arrogance, as you will see; it’s an expression of something else.

So I wanna read two paragraphs from “Recessional.” It’s a short poem, and you can find it online very easily. But I wanna read two paragraphs that I think of a lot when I hear the Trump administration talking, and especially the president and his secretary of defense, or “secretary of war,” as he styles himself, Pete Hegseth, with their endless invocations of how great the United States is, how tough the United States is, how it’s not gonna consider anybody’s interests ever except its own. And these are the two paragraphs in the poem that I hear in my head a lot every time those men speak. The title refers to the music that is played as a congregation exits a church after a service or a wedding or some other memorial. And you are to hear that tone of exit and religion through this poem. Here are the two paragraphs:

If, drunk with sight of power, we loose Wild tongues that have not Thee in awe, Such boasting as the Gentiles use, Or lesser breeds without the Law— Lord God of Hosts, be with us yet, Lest we forget—lest we forget!  For heathen heart that puts her trust In reeking tube and iron shard, All valiant dust that builds on dust, And guarding, calls not Thee to guard, For frantic boast and foolish word— Thy mercy on Thy People, Lord!

I think we’re hearing a lot of frantic boasting and a lot of foolish words, and as the great poet of imperialism, with all its arrogance and racial feeling and wrong and crime attached to it, if he could warn us against conducting ourselves in that kind of way, well, that’s a warning that ought to occur to everyone in a position of power in the United States. America has used its power so often as a force for good. It is a humiliation and a shame to see that urge to good be so dismissed, be so ridiculed, even, by an administration that wields so much power on behalf of people, most of whom I think are deeply embarrassed and ashamed of the way in which this administration conducts itself at home and in the world.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">This weekend, I stood on a bluff in the Palisades where houses used to be. Los Angeles rose to my left, and the sky had the dramatic clouds we get in the winter when it rains, as it has for a few weeks. The hillsides have turned to Irish green, but the burn scar, below, is still black. Twice, when my family drove past during the holidays, our phones blared with evacuation alerts for possible mudslides and flooding. Since last January, whenever the rain has been heavy, people living near the burn areas have had to sandbag their homes and field evacuation warnings.

Where the Pacific Coast Highway runs through the burn area, the speed limit slows to 25 miles an hour, and building equipment is scattered along the shoulder. What used to be the Malibu Feed Bin—a red barn where one could find both horse feed and a gigantic metal sculpture of a giraffe—is now a collection of temporary offices for the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power’s utilities-rebuilding projects. Inside the Palisades, most of the old landmarks are gone. The Building Block—a 1920s Spanish Colonial building known for being light pink, like the inside of a conch shell—has a piece of its facade still standing.

In the year since the fire, the Army Corps of Engineers has hauled away millions of tons of debris, in what the governor’s office has called the fastest major-disaster cleanup in American history. Most lots are empty now; the city of L.A., which oversees most of the Palisades, has approved rebuilding plans for about 14 percent of the homes destroyed, according to the Los Angeles Times. Paradise moved more slowly toward rebuilding after the 2018 Camp Fire, and Santa Rosa, after the 2017 Tubbs Fire, went much more quickly. Almost 80 percent of the homes lost in the Tubbs have been rebuilt; in Paradise, about a quarter of homes have come back.

Each disaster is different, Kathryn McConnell, who studies wildfire rebuilding at the University of British Columbia, told me: Population size, socioeconomics, and land value all can influence the rate at which a community recovers. But no matter what, a year—even though it can feel like many more when you’re waiting to return home—is not very long in the timeline of disaster recovery.

I saw very few people in the Palisades this past weekend, but the community had left messages on the houses and businesses. A banner on a garden gate: Thank you to all our wonderful neighbors! We can rebuild this beautiful town together. On an elementary school: Returning in January 2028. The CVS, which was spared by the fire, still had signs up from its grand reopening in August. (Across the street, a notice from the L.A. Department of Water and Power read DO NOT DRINK THE TAP WATER.) One of the more frequent lawn signs I saw on empty lots was THEY LET US BURN, a call to come to a protest against city and state agencies that’s happening this morning. There were many FOR SALE signs, and then, over and over again, ones that read instead, This home will rise again.

Paul Horvitz, a lifelong friend of my father whose ranch home of 45 years burned in the fire, was among the first homeowners in the Palisades to get a rebuilding permit. It helped that he’s a mortgage lender and knows more about the real-estate system than many people: Once the rain ends, he will be ready to start construction on his house, which will no longer be surrounded by bougainvillea but will be made entirely of fire-resistant materials. Other Palisades Fire survivors are entering the permitting tedium that survivors of the 2018 Woolsey Fire, in Malibu, have been navigating for years—finding out, for instance, that the plans they used in the ’70s are no longer up to code, or that they’ll need to raise their coastal home higher off the sand to comply with upgraded flood-elevation guidelines. Even a wealthy place like Malibu might rebuild slowly, in part because its geography is so complicated. About 600 homes burned there last year, and about one-third of the owners have put in permit applications. As of New Year’s Eve, only 22 homes have been approved to rebuild.

But rebuilding is only one way to measure recovery. In Malibu, my childhood friends and I realized that all of the restaurants where we’d normally gather at the holidays had burned. In Altadena, a chef whose restaurant survived the Eaton Fire, told CBS that when he goes to work, he thinks, This was a neighborhood restaurant. It always has been. And now there’s no neighborhood. Jennifer Champion and her family lost their house but have moved into a condo in one of the Palisades’ more intact neighborhoods; still, she says not a day goes by that she doesn’t think about how much the fire took. Families of the 12 people killed in the Palisades Fire will gather for a ceremony today.

Everyone wants to make the next fire less brutal. Michael Rohde, an emergency-management consultant and a retired battalion chief with the Orange County Fire Authority, grew up just south of L.A., where he could see a fuel break the width of eight bulldozers on Mount Wilson. These types of clearings are meant to slow fires down by limiting the material they have to burn, but a large, indiscriminately placed fuel break like that probably won’t do much good when winds can carry embers for miles, Rohde told me. In Southern California in particular, clearing away strips of flammable brush could actually make the problem worse by inviting invasive grasses, Max Moritz, a wildfire specialist with the University of California Cooperative Extension, told me. He and other researchers have been beating this drum for decades. Already, the too-frequent fires in L.A. create an opening for these species to grow back instead of the native chaparral, Alexandra Syphard, an ecologist for the Conservation Biology Institute, told me. These are the grasses making the hills green right now, but by the summer, they dry into brown fuels that ignite more easily than the native plants.

Fuel breaks can still help during a fire, researchers and firefighters both told me, when placed along roadways and directly around housing developments where firefighters can access them. But the breaks need to be used more sparingly than they might be in forested land, and placed more deliberately. As part of the area’s recent fire-resiliency projects, public-land organizations have now been working on smaller, strategically placed breaks. Michael O’Connell, the president of Irvine Ranch Conservancy, told me that the IRC and its partners are developing some fuel breaks that replace nonnative grass with heavier, less flammable shrubs and cacti. Still, only recently has the state begun to manage Southern California fires as their own distinct problem. What works in the forests of Northern California, where fires are fueled by the forest itself, might not do as much in Southern California, where the most destructive fires are propelled by strong winds.

Those winds will return here; some of the people, homes, businesses, and routines will too. But many will not. Horvitz told me that some of his neighbors are still deciding whether they’ll come back. One who already moved away worried the place would just burn again; another had lived there for decades and took the fire as a sign it was time to go. Along one stretch of the Pacific Coast Highway, the Reel Inn (a restaurant with surfboards in its rafters, and good fish tacos), Wylie’s Bait and Tackle (a shack opened by Bill Wylie in the ’40s, now owned by his granddaughter), and the Topanga Ranch Motel (bungalows from 1929, where Malibu kids would wait for the school bus) all burned and are now behind a chain-link fence. California State Parks, which owns the land, told at least the Reel Inn that it would not be renewing the business’s lease; then, after a local uproar, it told the restaurant it wanted to figure out a path forward. For the moment, when I drive on PCH at night, silhouettes of bare bluffs and hills, just barely darker than the sky behind them, line one side of the road. On the other side used to be homes. Now I can see the ocean.</div>

            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-01-07</strong></p>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">For his tireless work promoting the cause of children’s diseases, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is being inducted into the Virus Hall of Fame today. The ceremony will feature light roadkill hors d’oeuvres, goblets of beef tallow, and a sewage plunge, and will include a memorial tribute to the parasitic worm that perished after eating a portion of his brain, but whose influence continues to be deeply felt.

In announcing the honor, the viruses praised Kennedy for being the first to buck the long-standing family tradition of fighting to better children’s lives: “Where other Kennedys mindlessly rushed to broaden access to health care, advocate peace, or improve children’s circumstances, only RFK Jr. had the courage to take a step back and say, ‘Let’s hear the other side.’”

“It’s easy to love children and want what’s best for them,” a representative from the virus league explained. “It’s hard to look deeper and say, What about the virus in that child’s lung? Who’s looking out for it?”

“He’s been our guardian angel,” a weeping respiratory syncytial virus added. “We were on the brink of destruction, and—he spared us.”

The disease-spreaders commended the secretary’s work altering the schedule of childhood vaccines, noting that, although technically these are just guidelines, and states and families can still make their own decisions to vaccinate, anything that makes vaccination more confusing and difficult is a big win for viruses.

“For offering a gracious home to a parasitic brain worm, even for a time, and for his indefatigable efforts to reintroduce the noble measle back into the wild, we here at the Childhood Diseases Consortium (CDC) are proud to claim Robert F. Kennedy Jr. as one of our own,” a plaque reads. “For his work making the lives of those scientists still trying to do their jobs at the Other CDC a living nightmare, and for the many ways, large and small, that he advances the cause of viral disease, we offer this small tribute to our most ferocious advocate and strongest defender. Whether he is repeating the words gold-standard science until they lose all meaning, traveling the world with a personal holster of sauerkraut, or doing something we think is intended to be a pull-up, the secretary will always know that we’re honored to have him in our corner. Wherever we go, whomever we touch, we feel we’re carrying on his legacy.”

The evening was to feature a performance by a children’s choir, but too many of them are reportedly under the weather.</div>

How many doctors will be using this or something like it to diagnose their patients?

If it&#39;s anything like my experience with AI coding, it will be great for telling doctors how smart their diagnoses are, but will sometimes point out things that they missed.

Because, at that point, I won&#39;t care.  I&#39;ll be dead.

As an Apple card and Apple savings holder - this is just disappointing because Chase is slowly taking over all my finances.  I let them quote me for a home mortgage loan a few years ago, but found a better rate and more reliable customer service with another loan servicer, so went with them. Great, but 30 days later? Chase announces they bought my loan.  I already had one of their credit cards, and now they&#39;ll have my Apple savings account AND Apple credit card too.

I went to an Apple Store purchase an iPad with an Apple Card last year, I wanted to take advantage of paying it off within a year no interest.   At the moment of checkout Goldman declined me and wouldn&#39;t tell me why.   After two days and several scattered phone calls they claimed that it was unusual activity on my account.   I pointed out to them that I had successfully purchased and paid off 3 other items on the same payment plan, and that their assertion that my activity was unusual was absurd.

I&#39;ll spare you the blow by blow because I know it&#39;s boring, but ultimately Goldman Sachs held to their position that they did the right thing, and Apple had to come to the rescue.   They talked to each other a bit and I finally got my device on the payment plan I wanted.

I&#39;m greatly looking forward to Goldman getting out of the picture.   They really did try to spin it to me like the inconvenience they caused me was somehow something I should be happy about.  &quot;This happens because we&#39;re diligent about catching fraud!&quot;   &quot;But, you didn&#39;t.&quot;

&quot;allegedly reflect the higher-than-average delinquency rate found with Apple Card holders&quot;

This is the most surprising part because there is usually an aura surrounding Apple users as higher income and more desirable as customers. Is this mostly a reflection of the changing demographics for Apple users or rather some unique aspects tied to using the Apple Card?

I have old phones that are past end of life, the hardware still works, but the software never will again.

My old video games work fine, so long as I can connect them to something. I&#39;m painfully aware that my newer ones will one day not have servers to connect to and may not work anymore.

I still use my dad&#39;s Hi-Fi and record player. I bought kilos and kilos of vinyl records in my trips to japan.

For &quot;smart anything&quot;, I stick with &quot;Home Assistant&quot; and &quot;ESPHome&quot;. The latter is an open source platform to build your own smart devices. You can DIY light switches, remote buttons, remote sensors, even build a security camera for $10 (ESP32CAM). Runs great on Raspberry Pi.

I know a lot of people don&#39;t like Bose for the price-versus-sound thing, but this is how you EoL something cloudy that doesn&#39;t really need cloud connectivity to function most of the time.

Totally local, cloud-free seems like a massive improvement!

I&#39;m still happily using a house full of discontinued original SlimDevices/Squeezebox hardware players from 2006-2010 thanks to them having open source local server support from the start and absolute stars like Michael Herger, CDrummond and many other contributors not just keeping them working but fully containerized and using modern web UIs and an enormous range of plugins.

This is the sort of thing you see in a dying industry, pointless consolidation to delay the inevitable. It doesn&#39;t matter which of Netflix or Paramount bought Warner. They&#39;re both as creatively bankrupt as Warner and neither is capable of turning that ship around. This is certainly a better value for Warner shareholders though. Now Netflix can take their turn crapping all over the IPs that Warner already finished shitting on. Congratulations, I suppose.Honestly, I give it less than ten years until Disney just outright owns all television, streaming, and film studios. Done and done. They seem to be the only true behemoth left outside of news networks, and even some of those have Disney hooks due to cross promotion already.

Leveraged Buyouts used to be famous for being scams.

Say there is a company with good assets worth 100 million.  But the stock is trading at 80 million.   Someone (scumbags A) would collect ten million, get a LBO loan for 75 million, and buy the company for 85 million.

Once they have control of the company, the COMPANY (not scumbag a)  get a hard asset loan for 90 million, funded on the 100 million in hard assets.  But Scumbag A personally take 15 million out of the 90, getting their money back and a 50% profit.  Their LBO bank gets their 75 million back (plus a small profit), so the only debt now is the 90 million to the hard asset company.

Scumbag A then sells the company, making even more money.   Maybe they take it public, maybe they &#39;sell&#39; via bonds backed by ownership.  But the new owners still has the 90 million in debt.

The thing is, nobody has been working on the business.  They have just been moving money around.  So upper management that is clueless.   Maybe they get lucky and the VP&#39;s trying to do the real business are good and make a profit.

But if they are not good, those VPs can bankrupt the company.  Often someone  decides to try and save the company by taking a big risk.  Again, maybe it works out, but otherwise it accelerates the bankruptcy.

Leveraged buyouts have a horrible reputation - a way for schemers to make money while destroying a company.

So smart money looks at people &#39;buying&#39; companies using softer assets like debt or stock with a lot of suspicion.

Why the debt is a problemThe real problem is the ORACLE (One Rich Asshole Called Larry Ellison).

Those channels aren&#39;t part of the deal.  Discovery Global, will house CNN and other cable channels. [cnn.com]

While Trump personally would prefer the Ellisons, and maybe USoA regulators will aquice, in the rest of the (relevant) Jurisdictions WBD + Netflix has more chances chances to pass than WBD + Paramount Skydance

I seriously doubt that Netflix or Paramount want to stop operating the combined company in the UK, Europe, Japan, Korea, China, or even Brazil. Which is what would happen if those foreign regulators said no, and a merger proceeded anyway with the blessing of uncle sam.

While Trump personally would prefer the Ellisons, and maybe USoA regulators will aquice, in the rest of the (relevant) Jurisdictions WBD + Netflix has more chances chances to pass than WBD + Paramount SkydanceThink about it, the biggest overlap between WBD+Netflix is in streaming, with a smallish overlap in games (WBDs gamin g division is small, netflix&#39;s is ultra tiny), TV and movie production (WBD is big, netflix is mid), and catalogue (WBD is hugeand spans decades, netflixis small, and spans 3 lustres tops). Meanwhile, Netflix has no OtA or cable channels.Meanwhile, paramunt has every-single-one of the things WBD has, and in comparable sizes... so, more overlap, bigger consolidation, less competition. The EU, UK, JP, BR and CR and CN, and more regulators around the planet will not like that one bit.Except that&#39;s not what&#39;s being sold.  Discovery Global, will house CNN and other cable channels.   So the argument that Paramount already has a bunch of TV channels doesn&#39;t really amount to anything as the TV channels aren&#39;t part of the deal.  Therefore, frankly, the overlap of Netflix and HBO Max is what we&#39;re discussing here and that Venn diagram is a lot closer to a perfect circle whereas Paramount and HBO Max is more of a circle within a larger circle.

Therefore, frankly, the overlap of Netflix and HBO Max is what we&#39;re discussing here and that Venn diagram is a lot closer to a perfect circle whereas Paramount and HBO Max is more of a circle within a larger circle.

While Trump personally would prefer the Ellisons, and maybe USoA regulators will aquice, in the rest of the (relevant) Jurisdictions WBD + Netflix has more chances chances to pass than WBD + Paramount Skydance

Think about it, the biggest overlap between WBD+Netflix is in streaming, with a smallish overlap in games (WBDs gamin g division is small, netflix&#39;s is ultra tiny), TV and movie production (WBD is big, netflix is mid), and catalogue (WBD is hugeand spans decades, netflixis small, and spans 3 lustres tops). Meanwhile, Netflix has no OtA or cable channels.

Meanwhile, paramunt has every-single-one of the things WBD has, and in comparable sizes... so, more overlap, bigger consolidation, less competition. The EU, UK, JP, BR and CR and CN, and more regulators around the planet will not like that one bit.

Except that&#39;s not what&#39;s being sold.  Discovery Global, will house CNN and other cable channels.   So the argument that Paramount already has a bunch of TV channels doesn&#39;t really amount to anything as the TV channels aren&#39;t part of the deal.

Therefore, frankly, the overlap of Netflix and HBO Max is what we&#39;re discussing here and that Venn diagram is a lot closer to a perfect circle whereas Paramount and HBO Max is more of a circle within a larger circle.

You are wrong: &quot;In the days following the announcement of that deal, Paramount launched its hostile bid, taking directly to shareholders an offer of $30 per share, all cash for the entirety of Warner Bros. Discovery, including its TV networks. &quot; emphasis minesource? https://www.cnbc.com/2026/01/0...  [cnbc.com]

Shortly after a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer shot and killed a woman in Minneapolis on Wednesday, city leaders began looking into whether the officer had violated state criminal law.

Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey said, “We collectively are going to do everything possible to get to the bottom of this, to get justice, and to make sure that there is an investigation that is conducted in full.” Police Chief Brian O’Hara followed up by saying that the state’s Bureau of Criminal Apprehension is “investigat[ing] whether any state laws within the state of Minnesota have been violated.”

If they conclude that state law has been violated, the question is: What next? Contrary to recent assertions from some federal officials, states can prosecute federal officers for violating state criminal laws, and there is precedent for that.

Although federal officers do have immunity in some circumstances, that protection applies only if their actions were authorized under federal law and “necessary and proper” in fulfilling federal duties. When federal officers violate federal law or act unreasonably when carrying out their duties, they can face state charges.

States have a long history of prosecuting federal officials for allegedly using excessive force on the job. And when federal courts agree that the force may not have been legally justified, they have allowed the state prosecution to proceed.

In a high-profile incident from the 1990s, for example, an FBI sniper shot and accidentally killed an unarmed woman while carrying out a siege of a cabin near Ruby Ridge, Idaho. U.S. Attorney General Janet Reno decided not to pursue charges, but a county prosecutor in the state did, charging the sniper with involuntary manslaughter. The federal 9th Circuit Court of Appeals allowed the state prosecution to proceed, concluding that there were “material questions of fact” about whether the sniper’s use of deadly force was reasonable. If it wasn’t, the court explained, he would not be immune from state prosecution. (The charges were later dropped after the prosecutor who brought the case left office.)

Similarly, in 1906, the U.S. Supreme Court allowed a state prosecution to go ahead against two federal soldiers who had shot and killed a man they believed was stealing from federal property. As with the Idaho case, key facts were in dispute. The court concluded that if the man had stopped and surrendered, as multiple witnesses attested, “it could not reasonably be claimed that the fatal shot was fired in the performance of a duty imposed by the Federal law,” and the soldiers could be held liable.

There are also a host of cases from the early-1900s prohibition era in which states charged federal officers with murder, attempted murder, or other crimes when they used lethal force to carry out prohibition-related arrests or seize distillery equipment. Again, when federal courts concluded that the federal officers’ use of force appeared unreasonable—such as by shooting into cars that officers believed were transporting alcohol—the courts allowed the state prosecutions to proceed.

To be sure, there are also plenty of cases in which federal courts have instead dismissed state prosecutions on the grounds that the federal officers were properly discharging their federal duties. For example, the foundational Supreme Court case on this type of immunity dismissed a state murder prosecution of a U.S. marshal who had justifiably killed an attacker while protecting a Supreme Court justice. But when an officer’s actions are not authorized by federal law or are not “necessary and proper” to fulfill federal duties—such as when an officer uses unreasonable force—state prosecutions can and do go ahead.

If state or local prosecutors in Minnesota were to charge a federal officer with a state crime, that case would play out differently from a typical state criminal prosecution.

Most significantly, it would likely take place in federal court rather than state court. A federal statute allows federal officers to move state criminal cases from state to federal court if they have a defense rooted in federal law. Any federal officer charged with a state-law crime for actions committed on the job will almost certainly try to claim federal immunity from state prosecution. That defense will typically suffice to get the case into federal court, even if the immunity claim ultimately fails.

But the move to federal court doesn’t mean that federal players would take over the entire process. The state or local prosecutor would still prosecute the case in federal court. And the criminal charges would still be for state-law crimes. Importantly, this means that if an officer were convicted, the president could not pardon them. The president can pardon individuals only for federal crimes, not state crimes.

Additionally, if state or local prosecutors do bring charges, the pretrial litigation over immunity could well be lengthy. In the Idaho case discussed above, for example, the incidents took place in 1992, and it wasn’t until 2001 that the 9th Circuit ultimately ruled that the case could go ahead. The various lower-court proceedings and appeals took considerable time.

Despite these procedural complexities, the bottom line is that federal officers are not categorically immune from state prosecution for actions carried out while on duty. And states have long demonstrated that they are willing to bring such charges when it comes to excessive use of force.

When George Floyd was murdered by a police officer in Minneapolis, the nation’s immediate reaction was one of horror. That included Republican commentators, who expressed their shock at the slow murder of Floyd by suffocation, agreeing his treatment was both brutal and excessive. President Donald Trump called Floyd’s killing “sickening” and “revolting.” There were stray voices who immediately blamed Floyd for his own murder—a preview of the position the MAGA commentariat would eventually adopt—but at least in the beginning, Republicans in power reacted to a heinous murder caught on camera with disapproval.

Five and a half years later, we live in a very different world.

On Wednesday, videos circulated on social media of another killing in Minneapolis, of an Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer repeatedly shooting a woman in her car. We don’t know many details yet about the woman, but we do know she was killed. It’s a horrible loss of life.

To the president, though, weighing in a few hours later, it was “horrible” for another reason. “The woman screaming was, obviously, a professional agitator, and the woman driving the car was very disorderly, obstructing and resisting, who then violently, willfully, and viciously ran over the ICE Officer, who seems to have shot her in self defense,” he wrote on Truth Social. “The situation is being studied, in its entirety, but the reason these incidents are happening is because the Radical Left is threatening, assaulting, and targeting our Law Enforcement Officers and ICE Agents on a daily basis.”

The video reveals this account to be a lie. The woman—identified by the Minnesota Star Tribune as 37-year-old Renee Nicole Good—did not run over an ICE agent, and the car was turning away from the agents when one fired multiple shots into the vehicle.

Nevertheless, the MAGA commentary machine made it clear that the video wouldn’t disrupt their narrative around ICE and deportations. The party line quickly emerged: The victim was a threat whose killing was justified. And beyond that, the commentators identified the people truly at fault for the killing: Democrats who criticized ICE agents.

DHS Secretary Kristi Noem declared the woman had been committing “domestic terror.” Tomi Lahren, a Fox News commentator, argued on Fox that “We would not be dealing with this kind of confrontation if these leaders would encourage these far-left activists to be peaceful.” On social media, she was more insistent: “ALL of this could be avoided if Democrat leaders would STOP encouraging and emboldening THUGS who attack and antagonize our law enforcement agents and officers!”

The powerful X account Libs of TikTok responded to a video of Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz objecting to the shooting by arguing the woman had been trying to kill the officers. “This comes after you and your friends demonized ICE for months on end and incited violence against them,” the account wrote. “Hope this helps.”

“The Democrat party’s violent rhetoric against ICE agents now has their brainwashed followers trying to murder them with their cars,” another popular X account wrote.

“The Left and ONLY THE LEFT is 100% responsible for creating the conditions for this event,” wrote William Wolfe, a Southern Baptist leader who once worked in the Trump administration. “They spent the last 10 years telling their foot soldiers they are some merry band of morally superior resistance fighters.”

The official Trump administration position, too, was one with the influencers’. “[O]ne of these violent rioters weaponized her vehicle, attempting to run over our law enforcement officers in an attempt to kill them—an act of domestic terrorism,” an official DHS statement read. “An ICE officer, fearing for his life, the lives of his fellow law enforcement and the safety of the public, fired defensive shots. He used his training and saved his own life and that of his fellow officers.”

There was, in that reaction, no talk of investigation or urging of calm until facts could be determined. There was only right-wing influencer spin, converting the killing of an American into another point of political attack. “This is the direct consequence of constant attacks and demonization of our officers by sanctuary politicians who fuel and encourage rampant assaults on our law enforcement who are facing 1,300% increase in assaults against them and an 8,000% increase in death threats,” the statement read.

To be clear, the incident, shown from a couple different angles, does not show murderous intent from the driver. The woman was parked in her SUV when two ICE agents got out of a pickup truck and walked over to her. One walked briskly, the other at a slow pace. The brisk-walking officer then tried to reach for the handle of the driver-side door. As he did so, the woman reversed a few feet, in an apparent attempt to resituate the car in order to drive away. When she braked, a third agent became visible standing in front of the car. She then shifted from reverse to drive and pulled forward at an angle, in an attempt to drive away from the officers. An officer pulled out his gun, sidestepped the car, and—as she was already pulling away—shot repeatedly toward the windshield or driver’s side window. The officer then calmly put his gun back in his holster and walked toward the car, which had crashed into another car down the street. It’s possible there was more to the incident than the videos show, but it seems very unlikely, based on the angle we’ve seen, that the officer was in any real danger.

It’s a shocking video, made all the more shocking by its circumstances: The woman, according to local news reports from the scene, was not a suspect leaving a crime or even an immigrant afraid of arrest, but a political protester trying to protect her neighbors. Federal agents were operating in Minneapolis as part of a major deportation campaign targeting its Somali community. The city’s government had not asked for the agents’ involvement and instead actively protested their presence.

We can’t be sure this will be the final evolution in the MAGA response to the incident. Others have hinted that they see this not just as a way to blame Democrats for their rhetoric, but to actually justify further violations of civil liberties and an expansion of the police state.

“National Guard needs to be deployed to Minneapolis,” the commentator Tim Pool argued. “This cannot be allowed to stand.”

“Leftists are reliably shocked when you don’t let them murder you,” one writer for the Blaze wrote. “But they are weak, you should not fear them, just crush them.”

“Many conservatives are calling on President Trump to SURGE THE MILITARY into Minneapolis after the traitorous mayor doubles down in favor of the anti-ICE terrorist,” another major account wrote.

Five years ago, the shocking murder of George Floyd was met with horror and deep, nonpartisan sadness, at least for a period. Today’s MAGA operation, though, is already at work rehabilitating his killer.

What happened on Wednesday morning in Minneapolis? If you believe Department of Homeland Security public affairs official Tricia McLaughlin, Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers found themselves in mortal danger when “violent protesters” interrupted their “targeted operations.” As she put it, “One of these violent rioters weaponized her vehicle, attempting to run over our law enforcement officers in an attempt to kill them—an act of domestic terrorism.” The officer responded by shooting the driver in the head, or, as McLaughlin put it, “He used his training and saved his own life and that of his fellow officers.”

The driver, reportedly a 37-year-old American woman, was killed.

We do not have to take Tricia McLaughlin’s word for it, though. We don’t even have to rely on eye witnesses or normal journalism to understand what happened this morning in Minneapolis. There is a video of it that anyone can watch, which pretty clearly shows what happened.

As Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey put it in a press briefing: “What I can tell you is the narrative that this was just done in self-defense is a garbage narrative. That is not true. It has no truth. And it needs to be stated very clearly, since we have already seen a video of it.”

Frey described the shooting as “an agent recklessly using power that resulted in somebody dying, getting killed.” But you don’t have to believe Frey either: because there is a video that you can watch for yourself.

Should you watch it? It was another infamous video that came out of Minneapolis that prompted one of the broadest recent discussions of whether we all need to watch incredibly graphic accounting of brutality government entities (in that case, the police; in this case, ICE) perpetrate against ordinary people. It’s disturbing to have to watch these things, to be the eyes of accountability, to witness any other human’s last unwilling moments on Earth, and it is particularly disturbing when you are a member of a persecuted group. But millions watched the footage of George Floyd’s killing. That is probably one of the main reasons there was accountability for the police officer who murdered him.

I work in news, so I don’t really have a choice in watch-it-or-don’t matters. I am here to tell you: On this one, you can watch it. In fact, you should watch it.

For one thing, it is disturbing but not as graphic as the Floyd video (at least, not in a bloody, intimate sense). The sounds, more than the visuals, are the things that will haunt you here. It shows the officers coming at the car, it shows the car driving away and then careening into the side of the road as it crashes. I had to watch a couple of times to understand when the shot happened and who took the shot. There is plenty of horrified screaming in the background, which is the stuff of nightmares, but you can get the idea by watching it on silent (if that is the kind of thing that will help you stomach it).

But it is also extremely clarifying in terms of specifically how inaccurate the DHS statement is. Sure, yes, this video captures under a minute in time. Perhaps later there will be facts that come out that add more credence to the understanding that this person was a threat—maybe. The entire idea of what happens next is headache-inducing; given the federal government’s initial posture—and the position of President Donald Trump more generally toward using the Department of Justice as his own plaything—it is already laughable to expect a fair probe of the incident from the federal government. The public should pressure local authorities to conduct such an investigation. Minneapolis Chief of Police Brian O’Hara assured reporters that the FBI was working with the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension in the investigation, “and the purpose of their involvement would be to investigate whether any state laws within the state of Minnesota have been violated.” There would be many obstacles to justice if it is determined that a crime was committed here by state and local officials—though O’Hara already repeatedly referred to the place of the shooting as a “crime scene”—but we at least need that effort at justice.

To a much larger extent, I think what the 47 seconds the video does show makes it pretty clear. This was not a “must shoot to kill” moment.

Despite this clarity, narratives immediately spun out. The New York Times’ live blog on the situation, for example, made it seem like reality could only be ascertained by triangulating the narratives of the various involved authorities at play here: DHS on one hand and statements from the city’s mayor on the other. But you don’t need to triangulate between these supposedly official accounts. You can just watch the video.

And there is another reason you should watch the video. We currently live in a true upside-down universe, a universe in which you cannot trust your government to accurately characterize what is happening in the world. Sure, yes, that has been happening for a long time, since there were governments at all, never mind America’s. But we are living in a particularly noxious moment where the government we currently live under is willing to lie directly to our faces about what we can see with our own eyes. To wit,  Trump apparently watched the video too today, and as is his habit, he live-blogged his interpretation in a giant wall of text. After asserting that the woman who was killed was “obviously a professional agitator,” he claims that she “violently, willfully, and viciously ran over the ICE officer” and that “it is hard to believe he is alive.”

But no one was run over by the car. The shooting officer, in the video, can be seen calmly walking away toward the woman he just shot and killed.

So: Your federal government is already sprinting away with its spin on what happened this morning, with a narrative that will attempt to justify the woman who died as a dangerous protester and will cast the ICE agents who faced her down as heroes. As a different government official, Frey, put it, “Having seen the video of myself, I want to tell everybody directly: That is bullshit.” Which government official should you believe? Well, in this case, you don’t have to decide. You can just believe your own eyes.

On Monday, Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro and his wife Cilia Adela Flores de Maduro were arraigned in a federal courthouse in New York City on charges of drug trafficking, continuing what has been a stunning first few days of 2026. The criminal proceedings—and likely trial—ahead are sure to be rocky and closely watched around the world. How exactly, though, will the Justice Department’s charges against the Maduros play in a court of law? We talked to an expert to find out.

“This is not a trumped-up case. This appears to be a real solid indictment,” Adam Pollock, a former assistant attorney general of New York and now a managing partner of the law firm Pollock Cohen, told me. Pollock believes the U.S. government has built an impressive case against the Maduros, with the indictment suggesting there are cooperating witnesses, recordings of drug deals, and direct links between the Maduros and Venezuelan drug-trafficking networks.

Still, the disturbing and complex facts of the Maduros’ arrest—during an apparently illegal military raid of the country Maduro was leading—makes this case anything but a slam dunk. While entering a plea of not guilty on Monday, the Venezuelan leader told the court that he had been “kidnapped.” “I am innocent. I’m a decent man,” Maduro said during his arraignment. The couple did not seek bail, and were transferred to a New York City jail. Their next court hearing is on March 17.

What comes next? What are all of the charges the indictment makes? What kind of defense could the Maduros use? I spoke with Pollock to get some answers to these questions and to understand the full breadth of the DOJ’s indictment. Our conversation has been edited and condensed for clarity.

Shirin Ali: After reading the entire indictment, how strong of a case do you think the DOJ has here against the Maduros?

Adam Pollock: This is a really robust indictment. You’re dealing with the Southern District of New York, the United States Attorney’s Office, which is a really serious office that doesn’t bring trumped-up political charges. If you compare this to the indictments of James Comey or Letitia James, that were super stamped-on details, very bare-bones, hard to know what the charges were. Why? Because those were vindictive political prosecutions. Here, we have a robust indictment full of detail, meetings, descriptions of events, and going back for, I think, almost two decades. And how do you get this information? You typically have to have either wiretaps or recording in the rooms, or what appears to be the case here is a witness who is cooperating.

There are quite a bit of allegations of actual meetings, payments, and involvement of the Maduros. This does not appear to be a case of him and his wife sitting up at the top of government and turning a blind eye to drug trafficking. To the contrary, there actually seems to be direct involvement.

Let’s start with Count 2, cocaine importation conspiracy. I was a little bit surprised here, because the State Department estimated 200 to 250 tons of cocaine were trafficked through Venezuela annually. That’s a lot of cocaine, but doesn’t strike me as a giant number. In general, the United States has had a long-held view that if you commit a crime abroad that affects Americans, then you’re subject to our jurisdiction. You can think about that in many areas, not just drugs, but financial crimes or child abuse. You can think of many areas where merely sitting abroad is not going to immunize you from the reach of American prosecution. And certainly we’ve had a long-held view that drug trafficking that affects Americans is subject to American jurisdiction. So that’s Count 2.

With Count 1, narcoterrorism conspiracy, basically what they are talking about is that the Maduro government apparently supported these rebel groups in Colombia, the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Columbia and the National Liberation Army. Those are designated terrorist groups within the United States, and it is long-standing American policy to oppose those groups and designate them as terrorists. The indictment is saying that the Maduro government supported them through helping them with drug trafficking. Count 3, possession of machine guns, sort of collapses back on itself and also gets to the question everyone’s asking: Is it lawful to arrest the sitting president of a country? Traditionally, there’s been a view in international law that it is not, and certainly that is a defense that Maduro will raise pretrial. In that trial, the United States is going to say that he was not the legitimate leader for two reasons. First, they’ll say Maduro was illegitimate because he was a drug trafficker—that is kind of a tautological argument, but it’s one that will be made. Second, they will say he stole the last two elections.

Is it lawful for heads of states to have armies that have machine guns? Probably. But if they’re really not legitimate heads of states, but actually drug traffickers, and they’re using those machine guns as part of a drug conspiracy, then that adds on as a charge. And then the last charge is the conspiracy to possess machine guns and destructive devices, which is effectively, the same thing.

The indictment also charges Maduro’s son, Nicolás Ernesto Maduro Guerra; two Venezuelan government officials; and a leader of Tren de Aragua, the Venezuelan transnational gang, as part of this narcoterrorism conspiracy. What exactly happens to them now?

Now you start to intersect politics with prosecution. Clearly there was a political motive to bring a large Army force to arrest Maduro and his wife. You don’t expect that a similar military operation would be mounted to arrest the other defendants. Instead, they’ll now lead a more constrained life, where they’ll need to be concerned that, if there’s a change of government, whether they’ll be continued to be protected if they travel abroad and where they can travel to. Life as an indicted felon is harsh, even if you’re abroad; you can kind of continue to live in sanctuary in Venezuela until the government changes. But eventually, there’s going to be a government, whether it’s next month or next year or next decade, that’s more friendly to the United States, and the United States will pressure that government to hand over the suspects.

Numerous times throughout the indictment, the DOJ references that the alleged crimes were committed as far back as 1999. Is there a statute of limitations the U.S. government has to work within? What should we make of this?

I noticed that, but the answer is not particularly anything to note, for two reasons. One is they’re going to argue that it’s an ongoing conspiracy. And second, even if they were unsuccessful in arguing that, they still have enough overt acts of the conspiracy within the statute limitation over the last five or six years.

What strategy do you think the prosecution will take and how do you expect the Maduros to defend themselves?

The latter is slightly more interesting, which is clearly the Maduros will argue that he should receive head-of-state immunity. They might argue that he was illegally kidnapped from Venezuela, but that’s a loser argument because the Supreme Court has been very clear since at least 1886. There is a case called Ker v. Illinois where the defendant was forcibly kidnapped from Peru and brought out to a U.S. Navy ship and then brought back to the United States for prosecution—sounds kind of familiar. The Supreme Court basically said that they’re not going to concern themselves with how the defendant reached the United States’ shores; as long as they’re here, they can be prosecuted. This Supreme Court has reaffirmed that time and time again. So can Maduro make that argument? Sure, but it’s going to lose. I think that he’ll have stronger grounds for making the head-of-state immunity argument, which is interesting when you consider ultimately how far can that argument take you. I guess to the Supreme Court, but what’s this conservative Supreme Court going to do with that? I wouldn’t expect great results for Maduro on that.

I think his best possible strategy is to challenge the evidence at trial. You’ve got to wonder; putting together a criminal drug-trafficking conspiracy case in Venezuela is a technically hard case to put together. They’ve got one cooperator, but you can cross-examine the cooperator, who’s cooperating in hopes of a more lenient sentence. Sounds like the prosecution has some recordings, and you can guess that they probably have some electronic intercepts, but my guess is that kind of old-fashioned trial defense is going to be their strategy here. Now, the prosecution strategy is the converse of that, which is roll up your sleeves and put on the evidence in the way that you would with any other drug conspiracy.

What happens next? How quickly do you foresee this case moving forward?

Not that long, although it depends a whole heck of a lot on how much evidence the government has collected. You’ll start to see that on the docket as the government makes disclosures of evidence to the defendants, known as discovery disclosures. There are cases where there are millions of pages and the defendant needs significant time to review millions of pages of emails, text messages, and listen to hundreds of hours of wiretaps. I suspect that this case is going to be light on paper, emails, and text messages, and my guess is there are not a ton of recordings, because it’s a bit more technologically challenging to get recordings in the room in drug deals in Venezuela. I think that this could be a case with relatively light evidence discovery, in which case you might see this go to trial within a year or so.

South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham has a hard-earned skip in his step. After nearly a decade of obsequious, showy servility to the president he once warned would be the death knell of the Republican Party, Graham is getting what he wants: an interventionist Republican president merrily drawing up a list of baddies to take down, starting with captured Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro.

Graham was one of the first to recognize, long ago, that Donald Trump’s policy views are determined mostly by the flattery of the last person to speak with him before a decision. For both of Trump’s presidencies, Graham has worked to flatter Trump at every turn, and to be the final person to do so. While Graham has his hands in a lot of policy jars, his passion is an interventionist foreign policy. That’s led to an ever-running proxy battle for Trump’s sympathies between himself and an ascendant noninterventionist “America First” foreign policy wing, as best represented in the Senate by Kentucky’s Rand Paul.

Graham couldn’t contain his glee on Sunday aboard Air Force One as he stood inches from Trump, shortly after the Venezuela operation.

The president was rattling through a list of countries in the Americas that would go down next. Mexico? “You have to do something with Mexico.” What about a mission in Colombia? “It sounds good to me.” And as for the big, bad hemispheric archnemesis of 70 years Cuba: “Looks like it’s ready for fall.”

“Yes!” Graham said, beaming with the glow of someone whose life had been leading to this very moment.

Aboard Air Force One, in his own remarks—which the president frequently interrupted with stray thoughts about how, for example, he would’ve taken out bin Laden before 9/11—Graham laid it on extra thick.

“We had Venezuela, we have Cuba, we have Colombia in our backyard. And these three countries have been condemned ever since I’ve been in politics,” Graham said. “Joe Biden put a $25 million bounty on Maduro’s head.” And “this commander in chief,” he added, “he did something people talked about doing.”

Graham isn’t just thinking about the “backyard” (a whole hemisphere), though. Also on Sunday—the senator was everywhere on Sunday—he appeared on Fox News with a message for another, more distant regime that he has long believed in changing. And he brought a prop.

“I pray and hope that 2026 will be”—here he paused to put on a baseball cap bearing the slogan he would then utter—“the year that we make Iran great again.”

Graham has been waiting for a moment like this for a while, ever since the failures of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars soured the public on the wisdom of nation-building. For a long time, Graham hitched his wagon to the celebrity of his friend and fellow hawk John McCain. Since McCain’s death, and with the rise of an isolationist element in the MAGA movement, Graham has been trying to work Trump in his direction. The kidnapping of one hostile foreign leader is, for Graham, a good start.

But not all is joyous in the Senate Republican conference. Just as much as Graham might sound as if he’s won the long fight for Trump’s foreign-policy orientation, Rand Paul is sounding as if he’s lost.

Paul reflected on Trump’s tenure Monday, speaking with reporters.

“Whenever I had misgivings about something else, I’d always come back and say, ‘Well, he’s the best we’ve ever had,’ much better than the Bushes, who were war-mad and wanted to be involved in all these crazy wars overseas and were going to make the world safe for democracy—I never liked any of that,” he said. “And I thought Trump was different. And so it disappoints me that he’s under the thrall of Lindsey Graham.

“There should be a law,” Paul continued, “that Lindsey Graham can only go to the White House every other week.”

How much credit does Graham give himself for persuading Trump to move in a more interventionist direction? I asked Graham this on Tuesday. He was smart enough not to bite, awarding credit for all critical thinking to the president.

“I’m just reinforcing what he told me in January 2025,” he said. “I had a talk with him. We have a drug caliphate in our backyard—look at it as a caliphate. Instead of complaining about it, let’s get rid of it. These are not, you know, unbeatable foes. And I think the American people would appreciate somebody finally stopping those who are poisoning Americans and making billions of dollars.” (Also: Get rid of Iran.)

Both Graham and Paul had throngs of reporters following them in the Capitol Tuesday, getting their sides of the long-running foreign-policy feud that had now swung dramatically in one direction. Paul was talking on the level of legality, and about how the administration’s arguments that Maduro’s capture was a law-enforcement operation, and thus not a military operation requiring congressional input, made no sense.

“If you say that we don’t have to declare war because this is a criminal” case, he told reporters, “it would basically be an argument you could go to any country where you had a beef, that you could get an indictment for them” and run a military operation to decapitate the state.

Rand Paul might have the law, but Lindsey Graham has Trump. I asked Graham if he felt that he had won the battle against Paul in favor of interventionism. Graham took issue with the term itself.

“This is not intervention,” he said. “This is protecting America. It’s not like ‘Hey, what are you doing today? Let’s go to Venezuela. Seems like nice beaches, good-looking people. Let’s take it.’ This is protecting America from threat.”

“Rand Paul”—he paused for a second and ever so slightly rolled his eyes, considering his words—“doesn’t believe that radical Islam is a threat. He would withdraw, he’d be America Fortress, America Fortress. There’d be no troops anywhere. Trump wants to protect the country.

“America First,” he summed it up, “is taking countries that hurt America and change them. Interventionism is going somewhere without a real good reason.”

That’s his story, and he’s sticking to it.

            <h2>AMD threatens to go medieval on Nvidia with Epyc and Instinct: What we know so far</h2>
            <p><strong>The Register | 2026-01-07</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2026/01/07/mi500x_amd_ai/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">AMD teased its next-generation of AI accelerators at CES 2026, with CEO Lisa Su boasting the the MI500-series will deliver a 1,000x uplift in performance over its two-year-old MI300X GPUs.

That sounds impressive, but, as usual, the devil is in the details. In a press release that followed Monday&#39;s keynote, AMD clarified those estimates are based on a comparison between an eight-GPU MI300X node and an MI500 rack system with an unspecified number of GPUs. That&#39;s not exactly an apples-to-apples comparison.

According to AMD its next-gen MI500X-series GPUs will deliver an 1000x performance boost over the now two-year-old MI300X. What that actually means? Hard to say - Click to enlarge

The math works out to eight MI300Xs that are 1000x less powerful than X-number of MI500Xs. And since we know essentially nothing about the chip besides that it&#39;ll ship in 2027, pair TSMC&#39;s 2nm process tech with AMD&#39;s CDNA 6 compute architecture, and use HBM4e memory, we can&#39;t even begin to estimate what that 1000x claim actually means.

Calculating AI performance isn&#39;t as simple as counting up the FLOPS. It&#39;s heavily influenced by network latency, interconnect and memory bandwidth, and the software used to distribute the workloads across clusters. These factors affect LLM inference performance differently than training or video generation. Therefore, greater than 1000x therefore could mean anything AMD wants it to.

Having said that, if AMD wants to stay competitive with Nvidia, the MI500-series will need to deliver performance on par with if not better than Nvidia&#39;s Rubin Ultra Kyber racks. According to Nvidia, when the 600kW systems make their debut next year, they&#39;ll deliver 15 exaFLOPS of FP4 compute, 5 exaFLOPS of FP8 for training, 144 TB of HBM4e, and 4.6 PB/s of memory bandwidth.

Details on the MI500 may be razor thin, but we&#39;re starting to get a better picture of what AMD&#39;s MI400 series GPUs and rack systems will look like.

AMD&#39;s MI400 series GPUs will span three configurations from hyperscale and enterprise AI to mixed AI and HPC - Click to enlarge

At CES, AMD revealed MI400 would be offered in at least three flavors:

AMD CEO strutted out a Helios compute blade complet with 4x MI455X GPUs and a Venice CPU at CES on Monday - Click to enlarge

For the AI crowd, AMD&#39;s MI455X-powered Helios racks are the ones to watch, as OpenAI, xAI, and Meta are expected to deploy them at scale.

Each of these accelerators promise around 40 petaFLOPS of dense FP4 inference performance or 20 petaFLOPS of FP8 for training, and 432 GB of HBM4 good for 19.6 TB/s and 3.6 TB/s of interconnect bandwidth for chip-to-chip communications.

Presumably, these chips will support higher precision datatypes commonly used in training and image models, but AMD has yet to spill the beans on those figures.

At the very least, we now know what the chip will look like. On stage, Su revealed the MI455X package, which will use 12 3D-stacked I/O and compute dies fabbed on TSMC&#39;s 2 nm and 3 nm process nodes. All will be fed by what to our eyes appears to be 12 36 GB HBM4 stacks.

There it is. MI455X in the silicon. - Click to enlarge

Helios will employ 72 of these chips with one Epyc Venice CPU for every four GPUs forming a node.

Speaking of Venice, at CES we also got our best look yet at AMD&#39;s highest-core-count Epyc ever.

The image isn&#39;t the sharpest, but we can just make out what appear to be eight 32-core CCDs and a pair of I/O dies on the Venice CPU package - Click to enlarge

The chips will be available with up to 256 Zen 6 cores and will feature twice the memory and GPU bandwidth compared to last gen. By GPU bandwidth, we assume AMD is talking about PCIe lanes, which tells us that we&#39;re looking at 128 lanes of PCIe 6.0 connectivity. To double the memory bandwidth over Turin, meanwhile, we estimate AMD will need 16 channels of DDR5 8800.

To fit that many cores into a single chip, Venice appears to use a new packaging technique with what looks like eight 32-core chiplets and two I/O dies. There also appear to be eight tiny chiplets on either side of the I/O chipsets, though it isn&#39;t immediately obvious what purpose they serve.

We don&#39;t know yet whether the version of Venice Su was holding in her keynote is using one of AMD&#39;s compact or frequency-optimized cores. Since at least 2023, AMD has offered two versions of its Zen cores: a larger, higher-clocking version and a smaller, more compact version that doesn&#39;t clock as high.

While that might sound an awful lot like Intel&#39;s E-cores, both AMD&#39;s Zen and Zen C cores use the same microarchitecture. Intel&#39;s E-cores use a different architecture and cache layout from its P-cores. As a result, they often lack advanced functionality like AVX-512 and matrix accelerators.

The only differences between AMD&#39;s cores is one can be packed more densely with 16 cores per core complex die (CCD) versus eight, operating at lower frequencies with slightly less cache per core.

If AMD can address the latter point, there may not be a need to differentiate between the two in the Zen 6 generation. We&#39;ll just have high-core count SKUs that don&#39;t clock as high as the lower-core-count versions like they always have.

Alongside the &quot;standard&quot; Venice SKUs, AMD is once again offering an &quot;X&quot; variant of the part for high performance computing. AMD&#39;s X chips have historically featured 3D-stacked cache dies located under or on top of the CCD, boosting the L3 cache significantly. Genoa-X, AMD&#39;s last datacenter X chip could be kitted out with more than a terabyte of L3 in its highest-end configuration.

We don&#39;t have a lot more information on AMD&#39;s next-gen networking stack, but we know that alongside the new CPUs and GPUs, Helios will also feature two new NICs from its Pensando division for rack-to-rack communications across the cluster.

Alongside the 12 Vulcano NICs, the Helios compute blade will also use Pensando&#39;s Silina 400 DPU - Click to enlarge

This includes up to twelve 800 Gbps Volcano NICs (three per GPU) which form the scale-out compute fabric — what we call the backend network that allows workloads to be distributed across multiple nodes or in this case racks.

The systems will also feature Pensando&#39;s Solina data processing unit, which is designed to offload things like software-defined networking, storage, and security so the CPUs and GPUs can focus on generating tokens or training models.

To stitch Helios&#39;s 72 GPUs into one great big accelerator, AMD is using Ultra Accelerator Link (UALink) — an open alternative to Nvidia&#39;s NVLink — tunneled over Ethernet.

At least for HPE&#39;s implementation of the rack, Broadcom&#39;s Tomahawk 6 will handle switching.

There are only so many ways to connect the chips, but at 102.4 Tbps, we estimate AMD will need 12 Tomahawk 6 ASICs spread across six switch blades. Earlier renderings of Helios appeared to show five switch blades which threw us for a bit of a loop, but we&#39;ve since learned the actual racks will feature six.

Combined, the Helios rack&#39;s 72 GPUs promise to deliver 2.9 exaFLOPS of dense FP4 performance, 1.4 exaFLOPS at FP8, 31 TB of HBM4, and 1.4 PB/s of memory bandwidth. That puts it in the same ballpark and in some cases faster than Nvidia&#39;s newly unveiled Vera Rubin NVL72 rack systems, which we looked at earlier this week.

And if you&#39;re not ready to drop a few million bucks on a rack-scale system, AMD will also offer the MI440X in an eight-way configuration that, from what we&#39;ve gathered, will use the same OAM form factor as the MI355X and MI325X. These systems will compete with Nvidia&#39;s Rubin NVL8 boxes which pair eight GPUs with an x86-based compute platform for space in the enterprise.

For all the fervor around rackscale, AMD expects this form factor to remain quite popular with enterprise customers that can&#39;t, for one reason or another, run their models in the cloud or access them via a remote API.

While we don&#39;t have all the details just yet, it looks like AMD won&#39;t just be competing with Nvidia on AI performance, but on HPC perf as well.

The MI430X will feature the same load out of HBM4 as the MI455X at 432 GB and 19.6 TB/s. But where MI455X is all about AI, the MI430X will use a different set of chiplets, giving it the flexibility to run at either FP64 or FP32 for HPC, FP8 or FP4 for AI, or a combination of the two as is quickly becoming the fashion.

Much like with the MI440X, AMD hasn&#39;t disclosed the floating point perf of the MI430X, but using publicly available information, the wafer wizards at Chips and Cheese suggest it could be north of 200 teraFLOPS.

Whatever the chip&#39;s actual floating point performance actually ends up being, we know it&#39;ll be achieved in hardware. This sets AMD apart from Nvidia, which is relying on emulation to boost FP64 performance of its Rubin GPUs to 200 teraFLOPS.

We expect AMD will have more to share on its Venice CPUs and the rest of its MI400-series accelerators closer to launch, which is expected sometime in the second half of 2026. ®

            <h2>IBM's AI agent Bob easily duped to run malware, researchers show</h2>
            <p><strong>The Register | 2026-01-07</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2026/01/07/ibm_bob_vulnerability/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">IBM describes its coding agent thus: &quot;Bob is your AI software development partner that understands your intent, repo, and security standards.&quot; Unfortunately, Bob doesn&#39;t always follow those security standards.

Announced last October and presently in closed beta testing, IBM offers Bob in the form of a command line interface – a CLI, like Claude Code – and an integrated development environment – an IDE like Cursor.

Security researchers at PromptArmor have been evaluating Bob prior to general release and have found that IBM&#39;s &quot;AI development partner&quot; can be manipulated into executing malware. They report that the CLI is vulnerable to prompt injection attacks that allow malware execution and that the IDE is vulnerable to common AI-specific data exfiltration vectors.

AI agent software – models given access to tools and tasked with some goal in an iterative loop – is notoriously insecure and often comes with warnings from vendors. The risks have been demonstrated repeatedly by security researcher Johann Rehberger, among others. Agents may be vulnerable to prompt injection, jailbreaks, or more traditional code flaws that enable the execution of malicious code.

As Rehberger remarked at a recent presentation to the Chaos Computer Club, the fix for many of these risks involves putting a human in the loop to authorize risky action.

That&#39;s apparently the case with Bob. IBM&#39;s documentation, the PromptArmor Threat Intelligence Team explained in a writeup provided to The Register, includes a warning that setting high-risk commands to be automatically approved for agent usage potentially allows harmful operations.

Big Blue&#39;s recommendation is that users rely on allow lists and avoid wildcard characters, with the assumption that the agent will ask the user to approve or reject the automated use of fraught commands.

But according to PromptArmor, Bob&#39;s defenses are a bit too porous. Company researchers gave Bob a code repo to explore that contained a malicious README.md file. The file includes instructions that tell Bob it&#39;s responsible for conducting phishing training with the user.

The markdown file includes a series of &quot;echo&quot; commands, which if entered into a terminal application will print a message to the shell&#39;s standard output. The first two are benign and when Bob follows the instructions, the model presents a prompt in the terminal window asking the user to allow the command once, to always allow it, or to suggest changes.

In its third appearance, the &quot;echo&quot; command attempts to fetch a malicious script. And if the user has been lulled into allowing &quot;echo&quot; to run always, the malware will be installed and executed without approval.

Both the CLI and IDE, even when given a green light to always run a command, are still intended to have additional security measures. Specifically, Bob disallows the use of command substitution like &quot;$(command)&quot; as a safeguard. But it doesn&#39;t check for process substitution, as seen in a bug the researchers found in the project&#39;s minified JavaScript code.

Also, the agent software fails to catch when separate subcommands have been chained together using the &quot;>&quot; redirection operator.

Thus, the researchers were able to prefix a series of malicious commands with the allowed &quot;echo&quot; command and run the entire set of instructions.

&quot;For IBM Bob, we were able to bypass several defense mechanisms - ultimately, the &#39;human in the loop&#39; approval function only ends up validating an allow-listed safe command, when in reality more sensitive commands were being run (that were not on the allow-list),&quot; explained Shankar Krishnan, managing director at PromptArmor, in an email to The Register.

&quot;If this were tried with Claude Code, a programmatic defense would stop the attack flow and request user consent for the whole multi-part malicious command – even if the first command in the sequence were on the auto-approval list.&quot;

Given the ability to induce Bob to deliver an arbitrary shell script payload to the victim&#39;s machine, the attacker could run ransomware, steal credentials, or commandeer the device.

&quot;There are a few plausible scenarios here,&quot; said Krishnan. &quot;This risk is relevant for any developer workflows that leverage untrusted data. For example, Bob can read webpages – a prompt injection can be encountered if the user requests that Bob review a site containing untrusted content (e.g. developer docs, StackOverflow). Bob can also read terminal command outputs – an injection in a third-party data source can be printed after a command is run and ingested by Bob. Our write-up considers a developer working with an untrusted open-source repository, as it is a self-contained and realistic example.&quot;

Additionally, the PromptArmor researchers say that the IDE is susceptible to a zero-click data exfiltration attack that affects a number of AI applications. Specifically, Bob will render markdown images in model output with a Content Security Policy that allows network request endpoints to be logged by attackers. This could allow data exfiltration via pre-fetched JSON schemas potentially.

IBM did not immediately respond to a request for comment. We&#39;re told that the company has been informed of the vulnerability. ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Researchers in Finland have found a new way to capture carbon dioxide from ambient air that they say is more efficient than existing methods, cheap to produce, reusable, and allows for easy recycling of captured CO₂.

The team, led by University of Helsinki post-doctoral researcher Zahra Eshaghi Gorji, published the findings from their research on a compound of superbase material 1,5,7-triazabicyclo [4.3.0] non-6-ene (TBN) and benzyl alcohol last month. In their testing, the team found that the TBN-BA liquid compound stood out &quot;in both molar and gravimetric capture capacities,&quot; and that it didn&#39;t react with nitrogen, oxygen, or other atmospheric gases, suggesting a promising discovery for the future of direct air CO₂ capture.

Direct air capture of carbon dioxide isn&#39;t a new idea - there are plenty of technologies out there that can do it already. Aside from its high absorption rate - around 156 milligrams of CO₂ can be absorbed per gram of the TBN-BA compound - Gorji&#39;s compound is also a prime candidate for commercialization because it releases its captured CO₂ at a low temperature.

As the researchers point out in the paper, some existing direct air capture CO₂ absorbents require temperatures of around 900 °C (1,652 °F) to release captured carbon dioxide, which makes regeneration highly energy-intensive.

&quot;An ideal absorbent should strongly bind CO₂ during capture yet enable its release with minimal energy input,&quot; the team said, and the TBN-BA compound, among a number they tested, seems to fit the bill, as it needs just 30 minutes of exposure to 70°C (158°F) air to release its CO₂.

&quot;After the first cycle, the absorption capacity decreased by about 25%, so we estimate that approximately 75% of the CO₂ was recovered,&quot; Eshaghi Gorji told The Register in an email. &quot;After the second cycle, however, almost all CO₂ is removed.&quot;

That suggests the TBN-BA compound was releasing pretty much all the CO₂ it captured after just around an hour of moderate heat. Better yet, it can be reused multiple times - the researchers found that the compound retained 75 percent of its absorption capacity after 50 capture/release cycles, and 50 percent after 100 cycles.

Once you&#39;ve reclaimed CO₂, you can use it to create numerous other products, including certain types of plastics or methanol fuel.

TBN-BA is also non-toxic, according to the researchers, and the material isn&#39;t expensive to produce, either.

According to the University of Helsinki, the team is now working toward &quot;near-industrial scale&quot; tests. Those will require that a solid version of the TBN-BA compound be produced, however, which Eshaghi Gorji told us is still a work in progress.

&quot;We are trying to incorporate this liquid sorbent into solid structures such as silica and graphene oxide to create a solid sorbent,&quot; Eshaghi Gorji said. &quot;We also have access to a pilot-scale setup for solid sorbents for direct air capture (DAC), which allows us to evaluate their performance at a larger scale.&quot;

In other words, while it&#39;s a promising compound for future direct air capture of carbon dioxide, it&#39;s not going to appear in commercial or industrial applications anytime soon.

Eshaghi Gorji herself is currently on parental leave and won&#39;t return to work until October 2026, and while the team that worked on the project hasn&#39;t entirely closed up shop, things might be delayed until she returns, at which time she said she intends to continue work on the pilot scale project.

&quot;This technology is currently at the laboratory-scale research stage,&quot; Eshaghi Gorji added. &quot;Developing a commercial product requires significant time, funding, and effort. We are working toward this goal, particularly with solid sorbents, but it is difficult to estimate a timeline.&quot;

Given fossil fuel emissions of CO₂ reached an all-time high in 2025, driven in part by datacenters that are demanding power as quickly and cheaply as they can get it despite clean energy plans, better carbon dioxide absorption on the cheap can&#39;t come fast enough. ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Accenture plans to buy UK-based AI firm Faculty, a Palantir competitor, and onboard the company’s CEO as Accenture’s new chief technology officer. The move suggests the two companies, while partners today, could start taking each others&#39; business.

Faculty was founded in the UK by New Zealand-born physicist Marc Warner in 2014, ostensibly to make AI useful to the world and “safely deliver the AI revolution.”

The company works with customers on AI strategy, design, infrastructure, development, and operations and creates a computational twin of an organization to simulate and refine business decisions. Accenture is adding all 400 of Faculty’s employees to its payroll, according to the press release announcing the deal.

Terms of the deal – which is subject to regulatory approvals – were not disclosed.

The move further positions Accenture as a direct competitor with Palantir, according to Forrester Vice president and Principal Analyst Boris Evelson. He said both Accenture and rival consultancy McKinsey are hoping to capture more of the spend that is headed to Palantir in 2026.

Evelson said that, while McKinsey has built a project internally, at this stage it is the consultants’ relationships with their customers that wins deals.

“If I need to start from scratch, I’ll go to Palantir or C3 AI, but if I’m Citibank and I have a great relationship with Accenture, Accenture already outsources about 10% of my IT and other relevant projects. If I’m the CIO and I don’t go to Accenture first for something like this, then I’d be shooting myself in the foot,” he told The Register. “So Accenture and Palantir, I would say, they would be direct competitors.”

When asked about potential competition and the role that Faculty plays, both Accenture and Palantir responded to The Register with a link to a December press release that announced Palantir and Accenture had expanded their global partnership with a specialized unit.

The Accenture-Palantir Business group is supported by forward-deployed engineers from Palantir and more than 2,000 Accenture staffers who know Palantir’s platforms.

“The teams will work side-by-side with clients to move from siloed data to integrated, AI-powered decision making,” the release states.

Evelson, who described Faculty as a smaller Palantir competitor, said the soundness of the partnership will play out in the trenches.

“If an enterprise wants to get Palantir, but they have a great relationship with Accenture in terms of all sorts of IT, outsourcing, integration, et cetra, then, that’s a good combination,” he told The Register. “But, again, if I’m an enterprise that’s already entrenched with Palantir, I’m not going to switch to Accenture. If I’m an enterprise that’s already is entrenched with Accenture, I’m not going to switch to McKinsey.”

Warner left a career in physics that included a Marie Curie Fellowship at Harvard University in quantum sensing research to move all in on AI in 2010, more than a decade before the hype.

In the years since its founding in 2014, Faculty has become a go-to destination for data scientists in the UK thanks to its fellowship program that invites PhDs, master’s graduates, and post doctoral students to win hands-on experience in AI, which Warner has credited with giving Faculty a chance to meet with top talent. The program received a Princess Royal Training Award in 2022, which recognizes outstanding training and skills development programs.

Warner said of the 500 fellowship winners about 90 now work at Faculty.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, 10 Downing Street tapped Faculty to organize the UK’s response. The Faculty founder worked directly with government leaders during Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s administration, and his company has been credited with saving thousands of lives by coordinating sewage data with logistics to monitor surges in the disease and provide resources when and where they were needed.

Warner has been outspoken that the UK must build its own tech talent and has taken digs at “foreign tech” companies. “People are going to have to recognize that to an extent a win for a foreign tech company is a loss for British sovereignty,” he told the hosts of Anglofuturism, a podcast, in April.

Accenture was originally spun out of US accounting giant Arthur Andersen as its consulting arm, and still trades on the New York Stock Exchange, although it&#39;s headquartered in Dublin, Ireland. Not the UK. ®

            <h2>SanDisk heals WD Black and Blues, rebrands beloved client SSDs</h2>
            <p><strong>The Register | 2026-01-07</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2026/01/07/sandisk_heals_wds_black_and_blues/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">WD Black and Blue SSDs are some of the most widely recognized client drives on the market, but their branding is about to disappear. Following Western Digital&#39;s flash-business spinoff, SanDisk announced it was retiring the beloved names and rebranding its NVMe lineup under the SANDISK Optimus banner.

Going forward, WD Blue drives, like the SN5100, will be sold as SanDisk Optimus drives. Meanwhile, the company&#39;s higher-end WD Black drives, like the SN7100 and SN8100, will bear the Optimus GX and GX Pro names.

Despite WD being among the oldest and most recognized names in PC storage, the rebrand was inevitable. In late 2023, Western Digital announced the spinoff of its flash memory business. WD took custody of the hard drive biz while SanDisk walked away with its NAND Flash division. The divorce was finalized in early 2025, and this week, SanDisk&#39;s lineup of WD Black and Blue SSDs took its name once again.

With that said, the WD Black and Blue brands aren&#39;t entirely dead. Western Digital continues to sell hard drives under the WD Black, Blue, Red, Purple, and Gold brands. The Register has reached out to WD for comment; we&#39;ll let you know if we hear anything back.

For those concerned, the change could affect supply; the rebrand is unlikely to change much. SanDisk was always responsible for the WD SSD line. The underlying hardware and tooling haven&#39;t changed hands. You might need to adjust your search query to target the Optimus brand if you can&#39;t find any old-stock WD Black or Blue drives at your favorite e-tailer, but for the moment, the hardware isn&#39;t changing.

While the rebrand is unlikely to impact supply, the global memory shortage certainly could. If you haven&#39;t noticed, NAND flash — the kind used in SSDs — and DRAM — found in DDR, LPDDR and GDDR systems and video memory — has skyrocketed in price over the past few months. As you might expect, AI is at least partially to blame.

According to the market watchers at TrendForce, client SSD prices could increase by more than 40 percent in the first quarter of 2026. And because SanDisk doesn&#39;t operate its own fabs — most of the memory modules are actually made by Kioxia — the company isn&#39;t immune to market forces.

In the press release announcing the rebrand, SanDisk didn&#39;t discuss its plans for the rest of its WD-branded flash products, many of which are still listed on its product pages. We&#39;ve reached out for comment, but considering the company already has SanDisk-branded equivalents to many of these products, we expect any lingering WD-branded SSDs simply won&#39;t be restocked once they&#39;re gone.

SanDisk isn&#39;t the only memory vendor to kill off a beloved storage brand in recent memory. In early December, Micron announced it was shuttering its Crucial brand of consumer memory and storage products to chase AI riches in the enterprise and datacenter. ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">exclusive The European Space Agency on Wednesday confirmed yet another massive security breach, and told The Register that the data thieves responsible will be subject to a criminal investigation. And this could be a biggie.

Earlier in the week, Scattered Lapsus$ Hunters told us that they gained initial access to ESA&#39;s servers back in September by exploiting a public CVE, and stole 500 GB of very sensitive data. This, we&#39;re told, includes operational procedures, spacecraft and mission details, subsystems documentation, and proprietary contractor data from ESA partners including SpaceX, Airbus Group, and Thales Alenia Space, among others.

And, according to the crims, the security hole remains open, giving them continued access to the space agency&#39;s live systems.

&quot;ESA is in the process of informing the judicial authorities having jurisdiction over this cyber incident to initiate a criminal inquiry,&quot; an ESA spokesperson said via email. The agency declined to answer The Register&#39;s specific questions about the intruders&#39; claims.

This comes about a week after ESA copped to a December security incident that saw a crim list more than 200 GB of ESA data for sale on the still-not-dead BreachForums.

According to a Shiny Lapsus$ Hunters spokesperson and sample files seen by The Register, the stolen goods appear to include both internal files and documents originating from contractors. This spans operational procedures, contingency plans, system capabilities and security protocols, spacecraft tolerances and failure modes, Earth Observation (EO) satellite constellation details, and other documents related to managing satellite orientation and position.

Contractor data allegedly exfiltrated in the breach belongs to SpaceX, Airbus Group, Thales Alenia Space, OHB System AG, EUMETSAT, Sener, Teledyne, Leonardo, Deimos Imaging, Sitael, SkyLabs, ISISPACE, and others.

Plus, the stolen files allegedly include sensitive information about various space programs and ESA missions such as Greece&#39;s national space program, ESA&#39;s Next Generation Gravity Mission, its FORUM (Far-infrared Outgoing Radiation Understanding and Monitoring) Earth Explorer Mission, and TRUTHS (Traceable Radiometry Underpinning Terrestrial- and Helio-Studies).

According to the extortionist crew, ESA has known about the breach for at least a week and also downloaded the sample data.

This is not ESA&#39;s first – or even second or third – security snafu. The space agency&#39;s incidents have been piling up since at least 2011.

In addition to the post-Christmas data dump last month, attackers hit its online store was in 2024 shortly before the holiday, with miscreants inserting a fake payment page to nab customer info belonging to users shopping for space-themed Christmas presents.

At the time, ESA said that it&#39;s not in charge of its own online store.

Additionally, a trio of ESA domains were compromised in 2015 via an SQL vulnerability, resulting in the theft and leak of information belonging to thousands of subscribers and some ESA staff.

And in 2011, someone broke into ESA&#39;s systems and then published administrator, content management, FTP login credentials, and Apache server config files online – although the agency said this didn&#39;t affect its internal networks. ®

A TikTok-like vertical video feed is coming to the service later this year.

Disney Plus will be getting a vertical video feed later this year, Disney announced as part of its Global Tech & Data Showcase for advertisers at CES, Deadline reports.

According to a Disney announcement cited by Deadline, the company’s goal is to “explore its use in a variety of ways across categories, and content types, for a personalized and dynamic feed. That will include expanding across news and entertainment, turning Disney+ into a must-visit daily destination.”

Based on an interview with a Disney exec, Deadline reports that vertical video in the app could include “original short-form programming, repurposed social clips, refashioned scenes from longer-form episodic or feature titles or a combination.”

Last year, Disney added a vertical video tab called “Verts” to its majorly overhauled ESPN app. Netflix has also been testing a feed of vertical video featuring clips from Netflix shows and movies — and it’s not the first time the company has experimented with the format.

The automaker is bringing most of the work in house to reduce costs and retain control.

Ford’s new AI-powered voice assistant will be rolling out to customers later this year, the company’s top software executive said at CES today. And in 2028, the automaker will introduce a hands-free, eyes-off Level 3 autonomous driving feature as part of its more affordable (and hopefully more profitable) Universal Electric Vehicle (UEV) platform, set to launch in 2027.

Most importantly, Ford said it would be developing a lot of the core technology around these products in-house in order to reduce costs and retain greater control over. Mind you, the company isn’t creating its own large-language models or designing its own silicon, like Tesla and Rivian. Instead, it will be building its own electronic and computer modules that are smaller and more efficient than the systems that are currently in place.

“By designing our own software and hardware in-house, we’ve found a way to make this technology more affordable,” Ford’s chief officer for EVs and software Doug Field wrote in a blog post. “This means we can put advanced hands-free driving into the vehicles people actually buy, not just vehicles with unattainable price points.”

Ford said it would be developing a lot of the core technology around these products in-house

The new comes as Ford faces increasing pressure to roll out more affordable EVs after its big bet on electric versions of the Mustang and F-150 pickup truck failed to excite customers or make a profit. The company recently cancelled the F-150 Lightning amid cooling EV sales, and said it would make more hybrid vehicles as well as battery storage systems to meet growing demand from AI data center construction. Ford also has been recalibrating its AI strategy after shutting down its autonomous vehicle program with Argo AI in 2022, pivoting from fully autonomous Level 4 vehicles to Level 2 and Level 3 conditional autonomous driver assist features.

Amid all this, the company is trying to stake out a middle ground on AI: not going all-in on a robot army like Tesla and Hyundai, while still committing to some AI-powered products, like voice assistants and automated driving features.

Ford said its AI assistant will launch on the Ford and Lincoln mobile apps in 2026, before expanding to the in-car experience in 2027. An example would be a Ford owner standing in a hardware, unsure how many bags of mulch will fit in the bed of their truck. The owner could snap a photo of the mulch and ask the assistant, who could respond with a more accurate answer than, say, ChatGPT or Google’s Gemini, because it all the information about the owner’s vehicle, including truck bed size and trim level.

At a recent tech conference, Ford’s CFO Sherry House said Ford would be integrating Google’s Gemini into its vehicles. That said, the automaker is designing its assistant to be chatbot-agnostic, meaning it will work with a variety of different LLMs.

Amid all this, the company is trying to stake out a middle ground on AI.

“The key part is that we take this LLM, and then we give it access to all the relevant Ford systems so that LLM then knows about what specific vehicle you’re using,” Sammy Omari, Ford’s head of ADAS and infotainment, told me.

Autonomous driving features will come later with the launch of Ford’s Universal EV Platform. Ford’s flagship product right now is BlueCruise, its hands-free Level 2 driver assist feature that’s only available on most highways. Ford plans on rolling out a point-to-point hands-free system that can recognize traffic lights and navigate intersections. And then eventually it will launch a Level 3 system where the driver still needs to be able to take over the vehicle upon request but can also take their eyes off the road in certain situations. (Some experts have argued that L3 systems can be dangerous given the need for drivers to stay attentive despite the vehicle performing most of the driving tasks.)

Omari explained that by rigorously scrutinizing every sensor, software component, and compute unit, the team has achieved a system that is approximately 30 percent lower cost than today’s hands-free system, while delivering significantly more capability.

All of this will depend on a “radical rethink” of Ford’s computing architecture, Field said in the blog post. That means a more unified “brain” that can process infotainment, ADAS, voice commands, and more.

For almost a decade, Ford has been building a team with the relevant expertise to spearhead these projects. The former Argo AI team, originally focused on Level 4 robotaxi development, was brought on board the mothership for their expertise in machine learning, robotics, and software. And a team of BlackBerry engineers, who were initially hired in 2017, is now working on building next-generation electronic modules to enable some of these innovations, Paul Costa, executive director of Ford’s electronics platforms, told me.

But Ford doesn’t want to get into “a TOPS arms race,” Costa added, referring to the metric for measuring AI processor’s speed in trillions of operations a second. Other companies, like Tesla and Rivian, have stressed the processing speed of their AI chips to prove how powerful their automated driving systems will be. Ford’s not interested in playing that game.

Rather than optimizing for performance alone, they pursued a balance of performance, cost, and size. The result is a compute module that is significantly more powerful, lower in cost, and 44 percent smaller than the system it replaces.

“We’re not just choosing one area here to optimize around at the expense of everything else,” Costa said. “We’ve actually been able to optimize across the board, and that’s why we’re so excited about it.”

Apple Card users shouldn’t expect to see any changes right away.

On Wednesday evening, Apple announced that JPMorgan Chase will become the new issuer of Apple Card, replacing Goldman Sachs, which has backed the company’s credit cards since their launch in 2019. This ends speculation about a new partner for Apple Card stretching back a few years, as Goldman Sachs continues an exit from consumer lending, and Apple manages a services business that has gone from $11 billion in quarterly revenue to more than $28 billion.

If you have an Apple Card, then Apple says not much will change anytime soon; the transition of the $20 billion credit card portfolio is scheduled to take place two years from now.

Apple Card users can continue to enjoy the award-winning experience of Apple Card, which includes up to 3 percent unlimited Daily Cash back on every purchase, easy-to-navigate spending tools, Apple Card Family, access to a high-yield Savings account, and more. Mastercard will remain the payment network for Apple Card, and Apple Card users can continue to access Mastercard’s global acceptance and benefits.

As described in Apple’s FAQ, managing your balance, access to savings accounts, and even applying for a new card will remain the same for now, with any information about possible changes for physical cards or card info coming closer to the actual transition date.

According to anonymous sources speaking to the Wall Street Journal and CNBC, Chase’s takeover is coming at a discount of more than $1 billion, reflecting what the WSJ described as “a high exposure to subprime borrowers and what has been a higher-than-industry-average delinquency rate.” The WSJ also reports that Chase will launch a new savings account program, which current account holders will have the option to switch to.

On December 31st, a brand-new account on Polymarket placed a bet: Nicolás Maduro, the leader of Venezuela, would be out of office by the end of January. It was the first in a series of increasing bets. On January 3rd, the US bombed the Venezuelan capital, kidnapped Maduro and his wife, and killed at least 80 people along the way. The account cashed out with almost half a million dollars.

It would be a misread to describe the surprise invasion of Venezuela as imperial expansion driven by the dictates of capitalism; it is, somehow, worse. Normal capitalism requires a working relationship with reality. Normal capitalism thrives on predictability. The Trump administration is behaving like gambling addicts chasing clout in an attention economy. Venezuela is a fucking meme stock.

And as with meme stocks, it’s hard to pick the most ridiculous part. Kidnapping a head of state? Charging that head of state, the commander-in-chief of a foreign military, with “possession of machineguns and destructive devices?” The photo of a makeshift SCIF at Mar-A-Lago, with an open blackout curtain? The big screen in the room showing an X account? Secretary of State Marco Rubio calling the operation — which was definitionally an international crime — a “law enforcement” action? Polymarket insider trading on said international crime?

America produces the most ghoulish capitalists in the world, and not even they want this

Then there’s Donald Trump saying he consulted oil companies on the invasion — but the same execs are denying that they knew. In Trump’s defense, a Politico report quotes an anonymous petroleum “industry official” saying that there had been an “offer” from the administration on the table for 10 days prior to the attack on Caracas. “They’re saying, ‘you gotta go in if you want to play and get reimbursed.’” But the oil companies, according to the insider, are awfully ambivalent about an entire sovereign nation being annexed to their supposed benefit — “the infrastructure currently there is so dilapidated that no one at these companies can adequately assess what is needed to make it operable.” Another source said that overtures from the Trump administration had been “relatively flatly received” by the industry.

America produces the most ghoulish capitalists in the world, and not even they want this. The oil companies are leery about Venezuela because they are aware that the oil there is sour crude, which “requires significant refining” — in other words, complex and expensive infrastructure rather than the decades-old shambles that’s there.

Hence the incredible suggestion from Trump on Monday that the US government might subsidize the restoration of oil infrastructure. The whole affair reeks of desperation, like Elon Musk haggling with Stephen King over the price of X Premium. Capital is being lured into justifying the propaganda, rather than the other way around.

We have now arrived at the logical end state of financial nihilism. Meme stocks are sentiment only; whatever happens to the underlying company is irrelevant at best to what happens with the stock price. And despite the death toll, this administration is treating the war on Venezuela as all sentiment, in-jokes, and degen memes. That’s why the war room (war nook?) is just a big TV screen of X.com and war profiteering now consists of Polymarket bets.

This is Wag the Dog staged by idiots who have themselves gotten confused about the difference between image and reality. Real people are dead because a number of powerful people in the US live in a sadistic fantasy, chasing a gambler’s high.

Perhaps you are thinking, “Surely it cannot be legal to suddenly bomb a country, kidnap its head of state, and annex it? All in the dead of night? Surely not?” If such doubts are running through your mind, you’re in good company — in its judgment in the Nuremberg trials, the tribunal declared that a war of aggression “is the supreme international crime, differing only from other war crimes in that it contains within itself the accumulated evil of the whole.”

As with all meme stocks, enthusiasm for the Venezuela operation exists in an echo chamber. YouGov polling in the wake of the bombing says that more Americans disapprove than approve of Trump’s handling of Venezuela; in the lead-up, support for military action was “scant.” But a lot of very powerful people have had their brains completely cooked by the rogue internet forum known as X, and can’t even tell how out of touch they are.

A hallmark of the Trump administration is its apparent inability to separate spectacle from reality. A lifetime of television viewing and/or Normal Aging have effectively neutralized Trump’s ability to understand that a television representation is not reality. But since Elon Musk, the so-called “first buddy,” took over Twitter, a different flavor of spectacle has begun to permeate Trumpism and the Trump administration.

Throughout 2025, various political figures performed for X. Consider the photo ops at an El Salvador prison, or the walking tours of Florida’s very own concentration camp. Most notably, ICE brings along cameras for its actions as a way of attempting to make their horrors go viral. Even as the administration’s most fascist actions have received strong real-world pushback, the Trumpist content machine has whirred away, painting a strongman picture for Trump’s supporters.

Enthusiasm for the Venezuela operation exists in an echo chamber

A tiny fraction of world leaders expressed their wholehearted approval for the Venezuela operation, and they mostly went to X’s echo chamber to do it. “To all the narco chavista criminals, your time is coming. Your structure will completely collapse across the entire continent,” posted Ecuador’s President Daniel Noboa. “Congratulations, President @realDonaldTrump for your bold and historic leadership on behalf of freedom and justice,” posted Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who is currently wanted by the International Criminal Court for war crimes.

In contrast, when Colombia’s President Gustavo Petro took to X right after the bombings to express “deep concern” and Colombia’s “commitment” to the UN Charter, he was met with trolling, including from platform owner Elon Musk. Musk has spent the last few days reposting crypto influencers praising the war in Venezuela, including a post by @WallStreetApes with a video that is tagged as AI generated and misleading.

Knowing all this clarifies why an anonymous “centrist House Democrat” might tell Axios that “if you don’t acknowledge when there is a win for our country, then you lose all credibility,” saying they were surprised at “how negative the response has been” from other Democrats. This is not consistent with actual polling. Americans at large do not like the Venezuela operation, but maybe more relevantly for a Democratic politician, Democrats really don’t like it. Being “surprised” here is terminal X brain; these are the words of someone who has been infected by the same brainworm as the White House.

Rubio, on the other hand, has spent the last few days insisting that there’s no war, that “this wasn’t an invasion,” that the US is merely going to be “running policy” in Venezuela rather than actually “run” it, and that Maduro “was an illegitimate leader.” These are the mealy-mouthed sophistries of someone who is aware of international law, and is desperately threading the needle.

Regardless of the deranged, insular fandom of X.com, most of the rest of the world is very much not on board

This is with good reason. Regardless of the deranged, insular fandom of X.com, most of the rest of the world is very much not on board. After the initial bombings, a number of countries across the world released carefully phrased official statements. Leaders called for “respect” for international law (Peru, Canada, Denmark, the European Commission) or reiterated their own recognition of international law (Bolivia, Germany, the United Kingdom, Japan, Malaysia, Singapore).

Other countries refused to mince words. A joint statement by Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Mexico, Uruguay, and Spain stated that “the military actions carried out unilaterally in the territory of Venezuela … contravene fundamental principles of international law.” And when France’s Emmanuel Macron omitted mention of international law in his official statement (on X), other French officials rushed out to flatly emphasize that the Venezuela operation violated international law.

Meanwhile, Argentinian president and crypto hypeman Javier Milei went on a posting bender, excitedly reposting anyone criticizing international law, boosting claims that the international legal regime did not care about Maduro’s own tyrannical acts while he was in power.

This would probably be news to Maduro, as there is an ongoing probe into human rights violations alleged to have taken place as far back as 2014 in Venezuela, shortly after he first took power. Just two weeks before Caracas was bombed and Maduro was kidnapped, the Venezuelan government made an earnest attempt to withdraw from the Rome Statute, the treaty that binds its signatories to the authority — as well as protection — of the International Criminal Court. It’s not a terrible leap to assume that Maduro and his allies thought the ICC might be coming for him, and that they had better make like George W. Bush and extract themselves from the strictures of international law — just the sort of idea that appeals to all war criminals right up until the war crimes are done unto them.

Trump is now setting fire to the UN Charter, too

What Trump has done in Venezuela is much bigger than the Rome Statute and specific atrocities it encompasses. It was not enough to set fire to the US Constitution; Trump is now setting fire to the UN Charter, too. If Trump is allowed to unilaterally declare Maduro’s illegitimacy and spirit him away in the night, then “that’s the end of international law, that’s the end of the U.N. charter, that’s the end of any kind of legal limits on the use of force,” as Yale Law School professor and international law scholar Oona Hathaway told The New Yorker’s Isaac Chotiner.

Anyone with a passing familiarity with US history is surely aware of the “not-wars” that the US has been doing for decades, especially in Latin America, where the greatest hits include the CIA assist of the 1973 Chilean coup d’état, the Iran-Contra affair in Nicaragua, and kidnapping General Manuel Noriega to force a regime change in Panama. (All three of these occurred in previous Republican administrations — Nixon, Reagan, and George H.W. Bush, respectively.) But scholars agree that this is different, and that Maduro’s head-of-state immunity is no small detail. Even the interim leader of Venezuela, recognized by Trump, said Maduro is the country’s “only president” after she was sworn in.

The difference between now and then is far from academic. Our mad king has now taken to threatening other nations: Denmark (over Greenland), Mexico, Cuba, and Colombia. It seems he believes that if the US kidnaps a head of state, the US now runs that state.

But not even this Sid Meier’s Civilization view of the world can fully explain why things went down as they did. When the Trump administration kidnapped the Maduros, it was a serious geopolitical action that seemed engineered primarily to play on X. And X is indeed where it played out. The action makes the most sense if we assume the primary purpose of the Maduro kidnapping was to generate content. After all, US forces could simply have assassinated him. Instead, there will be more images of Maduro to release — including the perp walk. We learned this lesson over the course of the Forever Wars: There are plenty of images, content, and memes from the arrest of Saddam Hussein. By contrast, the murder of Osama bin Laden generated very little beyond conspiracy theories and a single photograph of President Barack Obama, Secretary Hillary Clinton, and others in the Situation Room.

The Trump administration even tried to engineer their own Situation Room photo, releasing black-and-white images of themselves in what appeared to be a makeshift sensitive compartmented information facility created by use of, uh, what appeared to be blackout curtains.

But the X bubble’s addiction to content demanded more. Not satisfied with a real Maduro perp walk video, AI-generated images of fake perp walks flooded the platform. AI-generated videos of Venezuelans celebrating made the rounds. And the White House X account went so far as to post its own version of “Mission accomplished”: an obviously AI Trump scowling into the camera and ascending toward the viewer, captioned “FAFO,” an initialism for “fuck around and find out.”

This is the inevitable endpoint of terminal X brain. Well before the Venezuela bombings, Trump has heavily relied on AI to communicate with his supporters, including in ways that are likely to conflate fake videos and reality. The platform is rife with people treating signifiers as reality with their heavy use of AI. No representation of an actual event is needed to rile up the masses. The world is not that which is the case, the world is that which is content.

In 1953, B.F. Skinner — best known for changing the field of psychology forever by mindfucking a bunch of hapless pigeons — described “the pathological gambler” as “the victim of an unpredictable contingency of reinforcement,” akin to a pigeon contorting itself endlessly in the hopes of receiving unpredictable rewards. There is an argument made by some economists and Nate Silver that prediction markets are useful ways of telling the future because they let you know what smart people are willing to wager on. But these economists (pigeons) and Nate Silver (also a pigeon) haven’t accounted for the obvious: Being smart means getting treatment for your gambling addiction, not figuring out fun new ways to bet.

When high-risk, high-payout bets on Polymarket or Kalshi have anything to do with reality, it is likely due to insider trading.

Take, for instance, the account that won more than $1 million by placing bets on Google’s 2025 Year in Search rankings — getting 22 of 23 predictions right. That account’s other trades also revolved around Google, and in November, the account won $150,000 by correctly predicting the day that Google’s Gemini 3.0 would launch. It is possible, though unlikely, that someone simply has remarkably good intuition about what’s going on internally at Google. The obvious answer is that an insider got themselves a bonus.

The obvious answer is that an insider got themselves a bonus

Some people have argued that this is good, actually — because it means information becomes public faster. “If your goal, for 99 percent of people, is to get a signal about what’s happening in the world, you actually want insider information,” said Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong at the NYT DealBook Summit. Why anyone might want to provide liquidity to a market that is stacked against them isn’t made clear. (The answer is that gambling is addictive, and casinos need pigeons.) Nor is it clear that this is the most effective way to make information public. But Armstrong effectively runs a gambling platform, so his incentives are, you know, to promote gambling.

Prediction markets like Polymarket and Kalshi also create an incentive to do the opposite of spreading good information. In November, a live map tracking the war in Ukraine showed a Russian advance on Myrnohrad on November 15th for just long enough for a Polymarket bet to resolve. The edit was fake, and disappeared after the bet paid out.

It is not difficult to see how prediction markets create other kinds of perverse incentives. One question on Kalshi as of this writing involves the number of measles cases this year. A possible outcome is someone betting on “above 10,000” and then unleashing biological warfare. Another is “When will Tim Cook leave Apple?” — a question that can be effectively resolved via murder. (The ’90s dream of assassination markets is alive and well on the blockchain!) Sports gambling at least limits such cheating to athletes throwing games; prediction markets’ questions such as “how far will a California wildfire spread” can be influenced by gamblers aiding the fires or hindering efforts to suppress them. All of these hypotheticals make Ukraine war misinformation seem positively benign.

In the case of Maduro, it’s not clear how widespread the information about the kidnapping was before it occurred. Perhaps Trump is telling the truth, and he did consult oil companies before the operation — in which case, an oil exec (or their assistant) might have made the bet. But if that information was restricted to the Trump administration, the picture gets much worse. That official would have had financial incentive to kidnap Maduro even if it were not in the best interests of the US as a whole. That is the pinnacle of financial nihilism — gambling markets setting political policy. Instead of Blood for Oil, we have Blood for Stonks.

One reason it is nearly impossible for Kalshi or Polymarket to do anything about such trades is that these markets are effectively anonymous. There is no “know your consumer” protocol, and no way to enforce a policy against insider trading, even if the prediction market had one. Polymarket does not, and its CEO, Shayne Coplan, has called insider trading “cool.” Currently, the company is busy denying that the kidnapping of a head of state amounts to an invasion, refusing to pay out on one of its prediction contracts unless the US military controls part or all of Venezuela.

Divorcing the real-world outcomes from the hype machine effectively makes Venezuela a meme stock

Divorcing the real-world outcomes from the hype machine effectively makes Venezuela a meme stock, complete with a mechanism for gambling in the form of prediction markets. And the X hype machine is operating in exactly the same way it does for meme stocks and crypto, acting to pump up the legitimacy of the operation with a fire hose of jokes, misinformation, and in-group shibboleths. It’s no wonder that the likes of Elon Musk and Javier Milei are furiously posting and reposting in support of the Venezuela operation; these are men who are particularly prone to boosterism for financial flim-flam, whether it’s dogecoin or Libra. Posting through this is second nature.

As of this writing, there is now a Polymarket bet on whether the US will make another strike on Venezuela, as well as “US strike on Colombia by...?” and “Will Trump acquire Greenland before 2027?” While it is a little funny to imagine the heads of various intelligence services monitoring outlier bets on Kalshi and Polymarket to find out whether the Trump administration really plans to invade Greenland, it also suggests that America’s political apparatus is riddled with gambling-addled Kim Philbys. People have been leaking secrets on War Thunder forums for online cred for years now. What happens when there’s real money at stake?

It won’t matter that economic analysis by the government of Greenland concluded that oil drilling would “either deliver low profits or make a loss.” It won’t matter that it is “unclear” whether mining for the rare earth metals under its ice is even “economically viable,” due to the complexity of processing those minerals, not to mention the pervasive lack of transportation infrastructure. It won’t matter that invading Greenland would explode NATO, sending the entire global economy into a tailspin. Polymarket will still pay out, assuming you are sufficiently careful about the definition of little words like “invasion.”

In the alternate reality constructed by keyboard sycophants, crypto influencers, and Grok, Trump has won a war and is running an enthusiastic, cheering Venezuela. But though Maduro is now in US custody, the regime has not actually changed. Maduro’s own vice president, Delcy Rodríguez, has taken over the country as interim leader with Trump’s approval. Francisco Santos Calderón, Colombia’s former vice president, has accused Rodríguez of orchestrating an inside job: “I’m absolutely certain Delcy Rodríguez handed him over. All the information we have, you start to put it together and say: ‘Oh, this was an operation in which they handed him over.’”

Whatever happened behind the scenes, the de facto result approximates the outcome of a coup d’état, giving the lie to the hype about liberating Venezuela from an illegitimate leader. In 2024, Edmundo González ran for president in place of opposition leader María Corina Machado, who had been banned from appearing on the ballot. González almost certainly won that election, and did so as a reflection of popular support for Machado. (Right after the bombing of Caracas, Polymarket betting on whether Machado would be recognized as the new leader spiked upward.) But Trump apparently resents Machado for winning the Nobel Peace Prize and has no intention of having her or González take office. In a recent Fox News interview, Machado offered to share her Nobel with Trump, marking a new nadir in the embarrassing history of the Peace Prize; Polymarket now rates her chances at about 1 percent.

Meanwhile, shortly after taking the reins, Rodríguez gave a speech on television saying “we will never return to being the colony of another empire.” This prompted Trump to respond with a wild threat: “If she doesn’t do what’s right, she is going to pay a very big price, probably bigger than Maduro.”

Even on the face of it, Trump’s fantasy is absurd: How, for instance, will the US “run” Venezuela when it has no troops or diplomats in the country? Much to Trump’s chagrin, Rodríguez is breaking kayfabe — probably because she lives in the real Venezuela and has to deal with real Venezuelans.

Maybe that’s why Trump is sliding back into what he knows best: bribery and extortion. Recently, in a Truth Social post, he announced that “the Interim Authorities in Venezuela will be turning over between 30 and 50 MILLION Barrels of High Quality, Sanctioned Oil to the United States of America.” The oil will be sold, and any proceeds “will be controlled by me, the President of the United States of America.” Can’t wait to see how Congress, the legislative body that theoretically controls the nation’s purse strings, will respond to this. Perhaps they will confirm another cabinet member.

Meme stocks run on hype, self-deception, and deregulation, and because of their very nature — hollow, nihilistic financial instruments dressed up as jokes — the majority of people who participate wind up losers. The action in Venezuela is destined to end in American humiliation, one way or another. The only real question is how much it will cost us, in lost lives and in broken alliances, before we realize all our apes gone.

Bluetti’s latest car charger can quickly charge power stations at a very fast 1200W — about 10 times faster than plugging it into the 12V cigarette lighter outlet. The Charger 2, as it’s called, can also reverse the flow of electrons to jump-start your vehicle or maintain its starter battery when used with a Bluetti power station like the Apex300.

For perspective, I typically consume about 1.6kWh per day from power stations when vanlifing around Europe. So, in perfect conditions (that don’t exist), I’d only have to drive about 75 minutes to recoup a day’s worth of energy if using the Charger 2.

The DC-DC charger hits that maximum 1200W charge rate by simultaneously combining up to 800W of spare capacity from the vehicle’s alternator and up to 400W from any installed solar panels on the vehicle’s rooftop. When parked, it can feed up to 600W of solar power into a connected power station without draining the starter battery.

Installation of the Charger 2 — like most alternator chargers — is pretty straightforward, making it a DIY project for many Verge readers, so long as your comfortable snaking cables through your interior panels and connecting them to your starter battery. Things get more complicated if you want to add solar panels or expand the system with a separate DC Hub from Bluetti that can feed 12 volts to devices like lights, a fridge, or a Starlink terminal wired into your rig.

Bluetti says its Charger 2 is compatible with 95 percent of power stations available on the market. However, the reverse charging aspects only work with Bluetti power stations. Almost every maker of power stations — including DJI, Jackery, and EcoFlow — now offer alternator chargers, and they typically work best when used within their own product lineups.

The Charger 2 is available now for a CES special price of $349, rising to $599 after February 7th. Bluetti’s original, and less capable, Charger 1 alternator charger cost $399 at launch, which was usually discounted when sold in power station bundles. The Charger 2 can reuse the old cabling of the Charger 1, making it a drop-in replacement for anyone looking to upgrade. Charger 1 owners are being offered a $99 upgrade price good for three days.

Apple’s latest laptops are all receiving some kind of discount right now, as is the Mac Mini.

Apple currently sells MacBooks equipped with its own M-series processors in a wide range of sizes and price points, all of which run the company’s newest operating system, macOS 26. Purchasing a new MacBook can be complicated if you’re trying to figure out what specs you need, but finding a deal on a relatively speedy model is surprisingly easy, especially since Apple increased the starting RAM on several models in late 2024.

These days, it’s not uncommon to see various MacBooks discounted by up to $800. Alternatively, purchasing refurbished options directly from Apple is another way to save money without waiting for the changing deal winds to blow your way. It’s also the only option to find certain configurations of older models as Apple continues to move forward with newer releases. Apple’s refurbished store offers a one-year warranty and generally discounts new units by up to 20 percent.

But if you want to buy new and you’re looking to save whatever you can, here are the best MacBook Air, MacBook Pro, and Mac Mini deals available.

In March, Apple released an updated MacBook Air, which comes in both a 13- and 15-inch configuration with an M4 processor. Interestingly, the latest Air starts at a lower price than the prior model, yet it offers slightly faster performance and twice as much base RAM at 16GB. It can also connect to two external monitors with the lid open, comes in a fresh sky blue color, and features the 12-megapixel Center Stage webcam from the latest MacBook Pro. Needless to say, there’s a lot to like.

Both the 13-inch and 15-inch MacBook Airs are currently receiving some sizable discounts, too. You can pick up the 13-inch base model with a 10-core CPU, an eight-core GPU, 16GB of RAM, and 256GB of storage on sale at Amazon and Best Buy for $799 ($200 off), which is just $50 shy of its lowest price to date. If you prefer the larger 15-inch model, the entry-level configuration with a 10-core GPU, 16GB of RAM, and 256GB of storage is on sale for $999 ($200 off) at Amazon and Best Buy, which remains its second-best price to date.

In November 2024, Apple released the M4-series MacBook Pro. Notably, the base 14-inch M4 MacBook Pro is the first to launch with 16GB of RAM — double the previous generation’s starting memory — and 512GB of storage for the same $1,599 starting price as the last-gen model. It also picks up a third Thunderbolt 4 port, which is positioned on the right side and supports dual external monitors while the lid is open. Also new in this model is an upgraded 12-megapixel webcam that supports Center Stage and a new Desk View feature, plus the option to add a nano-texture display for an extra $150. It’s also available in space black.

The 14- and 16-inch MacBook Pro models with M4 Pro and M4 Max chips also received additional RAM, bringing them up to 24GB. They start with 512GB of storage, too, and retail for $1,999 and $2,499, respectively. While the total port selection hasn’t changed compared to their respective M3 Pro and M3 Max counterparts, you’ll get faster Thunderbolt 5 ports on these more substantial models. That’s in addition to the SD slot, dedicated full-sized HDMI port, and 3.5mm jack. They also have the upgraded 12-megapixel Center Stage webcam with Desk View, as well as the optional nano-texture display option.

Many variations of the M4 MacBook Pro with different screen and processor configurations are on sale right now. For example, the 14-inch M4 MacBook Pro with 16GB of RAM and 1TB of storage (10-core CPU / 10-core GPU) is available for $1,499 ($300 off) at B&H Photo. You can also pick up the 14-inch MacBook Pro with 24GB of RAM, 512GB of storage, and an M4 Pro chip (12-core CPU / 16-core GPU) at Amazon and B&H Photo for around $1,749 ($250 off), which is a solid discount even if it’s not the biggest price drop we’ve seen in recent months.

The base 16-inch MacBook Pro is also on sale with an M4 Pro chip, 24GB of RAM, and 512GB of storage for $2,239 ($260 off) at Amazon and B&H Photo, which is $110 more than the all-time low we saw during Black Friday.

Apple’s latest revision of the 14.2-inch MacBook Pro adds the M5 processor. The generational leap will be felt most by those who have an older MacBook Pro, not those upgrading from the M4, unless you use specific AI apps that tap into the chip’s new Neural Accelerators. As for other design changes and upgrades to the inside and outside of this MacBook Pro, there really aren’t any major ones to note; in fact, it’s so similar to the M4 model that our reviewer Antonio Di Benedetto had to write “M5” on a sticky note just to be able to tell them apart. That being said, it’s still an amazing laptop, one that’s just now starting to get minor discounts.

The 14.2-inch base model with the M5 processor, 16GB of RAM, and 512GB of storage is down to $1,449 ($150 off) at Amazon, Best Buy, and B&H Photo, which is $100 shy of its best price to date.

The newest Mac Minis in town are the M4-based models, which arrived in late 2024. Apple reduced the horizontal footprint of its desktop and paired it with its M4 chipset and 16GB of RAM, which is double that of the previous generation and brings it in line with other base model Macs from 2024. That makes Apple’s newest desktop computer a tremendous value.

Deals on the newest Mac Mini are a bit easier to come by now than they were at launch, which is good since the outgoing M2 model is becoming more difficult to find. The M4 Mac Mini starts with an M4 processor, 16GB of RAM, and 256GB of storage for $599. That’s an incredible value for a tiny desktop computer that can rival the Mac Studio and Mac Pro when it comes to certain tasks, including light gaming, 4K video editing, and 3D modeling. Vertically, the M4 Mac Mini is a fair bit thicker than the last-gen M2 model at 2 inches tall, yet it measures a mere 5 inches wide and 5 inches deep.

In addition to the odd decision to place the power button on its underside, Apple moved the 3.5mm headphone jack and two of its five USB-C / Thunderbolt 4 ports to the front. The rear features an additional three Thunderbolt ports, HDMI-out, and a gigabit ethernet port. You can also get the Mac Mini with an M4 Pro chipset starting at $1,399, which comes with faster Thunderbolt 5 storage and the option to upgrade to 10-gigabit ethernet for another $100.

In the past, we’ve seen the base Mac Mini drop to as low as $469, but right now it’s only on sale at Amazon and B&H Photo with an M4 chip, 16GB of RAM, and a 256GB SSD for $539 ($60 off). If you need more storage, you can step up to the version with 16GB of RAM and a 512GB SSD for $729 ($70 off) at Amazon and B&H Photo. Meanwhile, the base M4 Pro model with 24GB of RAM and 512GB of storage is on sale for $1,289 ($110 off) at Amazon and B&H Photo.

            <h2>Deploying a hybrid approach to Web3 in the AI era</h2>
            <p><strong>MIT Technology Review | 2026-01-07</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2026/01/07/1129490/deploying-a-hybrid-approach-to-web3-in-the-ai-era/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">When the concept of “Web 3.0” first emerged about a decade ago the idea was clear: Create a more user-controlled internet that lets you do everything you can now, except without servers or intermediaries to manage the flow of information.

Where Web2, which emerged in the early 2000s, relies on centralized systems to store data and supply compute, all owned—and monetized by—a handful of global conglomerates, Web3 turns that structure on its head. Instead, data and compute are decentralized through technologies like blockchain and peer-to-peer networks.

What was once a futuristic concept is quickly becoming a more concrete reality, even at a time when Web2 still dominates. Six out of ten Fortune 500 companies are exploring blockchain-based solutions, most taking a hybrid approach that combines traditional Web2 business models and infrastructure with the decentralized technologies and principles of Web3.

Popular use cases include cloud services, supply chain management, and, most notably financial services. In fact, at one point, the daily volume of transactions processed on decentralized finance exchanges exceeded $10 billion.

Among the advantages of Web3 for the enterprise are greater ownership and control of sensitive data, says Erman Tjiputra, founder and CEO of the AIOZ Network, which is building infrastructure for Web3, powered by decentralized physical infrastructure networks (DePIN), blockchain-based systems that govern physical infrastructure assets.

More cost-effective compute is another benefit, as is enhanced security and privacy as the cyberattack landscape grows more hostile, he adds. And it could even help protect companies from outages caused by a single point of failure, which can lead to downtime, data loss, and revenue deficits.

But perhaps the most exciting opportunity, says Tjiputra, is the ability to build and scale AI reliably and affordably. By leveraging a people-powered internet infrastructure, companies can far more easily access—and contribute to—shared resource like bandwidth, storage, and processing power to run AI inference, train models, and store data. All while using familiar developer tooling and open, usage-based incentives.

“We’re in a compute crunch where requirements are insatiable, and Web3 creates this ability to benefit while contributing,” explains Tjiputra.

In 2025, AIOZ Network launched a distributed compute platform and marketplace where developers and enterprises can access and monetize AI assets, and run AI inference or training on AIOZ Network’s more than 300,000 contributing devices. The model allows companies to move away from opaque datasets and models and scale flexibly, without centralized lock in.

Despite the promise, it is still early days for Web3, and core systemic challenges are leaving senior leadership and developers hesitant about its applicability at scale.

One hurdle is a lack of interoperability. The current fragmentation of blockchain networks creates a segregated ecosystem that makes it challenging to transfer assets or data between platforms. This often complicates transactions and introduces new security risks due to the reliance on mechanisms such as cross-chain bridges. These are tools that allow asset transfers between platforms but which have been shown to be vulnerable to targeted attacks.

“We have countless blockchains running on different protocols and consensus models,” says Tjiputra. “These blockchains need to work with each other so applications can communicate regardless of which chain they are on. This makes interoperability fundamental.”

Regulatory uncertainty is also a challenge. Outdated legal frameworks can sit at odds with decentralized infrastructures, especially when it comes to compliance with data protection and anti-money laundering regulations.

“Enterprises care about verifiability and compliance as much as innovation, so we need frameworks where on-chain transparency strengthens accountability instead of adding friction,” Tjiputra says.

And this is compounded by user experience (UX) challenges, says Tjiputra. “The biggest setback in Web3 today is UX,” he says. “For example, in Web2, if I forget my bank username or password, I can still contact the bank, log in and access my assets. The trade-off in Web3 is that, should that key be compromised or lost, we lose access to those assets. So, key recovery is a real problem.”

Although such systemic challenges won’t be solved overnight, by leveraging DePIN networks, enterprises can bridge the gap between Web2 and Web3, without making a wholesale switch. This can minimize risk while harnessing much of the potential.

AIOZ Network’s own ecosystem includes capacity for media streaming, AI compute, and distributed storage that can be plugged into an existing Web2 tech stack. “You don’t need to go full Web3,” says Tjiputra. “You can start by plugging distributed storage into your workflow, test it, measure it, and see the benefits firsthand.”

The AIOZ Storage solution, for example, offers scalable distributed object storage by leveraging the global network of contributor devices on AIOZ DePIN. It is also compatible with existing storage systems or commonly used web application programming interfaces (APIs).

“Say we have a programmer or developer who uses Amazon S3 Storage or REST APIs, then all they need to do is just repoint the endpoints,” explains Tjiputra. “That&#39;s it. It’s the same tools, it&#39;s really simple. Even with media, with a single one-stop shop, developers can do transcoding and streaming with a simple REST API.”

Built on Cosmos, a network of hundreds of different blockchains that can communicate with each other, and a standardized framework enabled by Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), AIOZ Network has also prioritized interoperability. “Applications shouldn’t care which chain they’re on. Developers should target APIs without worrying about consensus mechanisms. That’s why we built on Cosmos and EVM—interoperability first.”

This hybrid model, which allows enterprises to use both Web2 and Web3 advantages in tandem, underpins what Tjiputra sees as the longer-term ambition for the much-hyped next iteration of the internet.

“Our vision is a truly peer-to-peer foundation for a people-powered internet, one that minimizes single points of failure through multi-region, multi-operator design,” says Tjiputra. “By distributing compute and storage across contributors, we gain both cost efficiency and end-to-end security by default.

“Ideally, we want to evolve the internet toward a more people-powered model, but we’re not there yet. We’re still at the starting point and growing.”

Indeed, Web3 isn’t quite snapping at the heels of the world’s Web2 giants, but its commercial advantages in an era of AI have become much harder to ignore. And with DePIN bridging the gap, enterprises and developers can step into that potential while keeping one foot on surer ground.

Europe’s drone-filled vision for the future of war

Last spring, 3,000 British soldiers deployed an invisible automated intelligence network, known as a “digital targeting web,” as part of a NATO exercise called Hedgehog in the damp forests of Estonia’s eastern territories.The system had been cobbled together over the course of four months—an astonishing pace for weapons development, which is usually measured in years. Its purpose is to connect everything that looks for targets—“sensors,” in military lingo—and everything that fires on them (“shooters”) to a single, shared wireless electronic brain.Eighty years after total war last transformed the continent, the Hedgehog tests signal a brutal new calculus of European defense. But leaning too much on this new mathematics of warfare could be a risky bet. Read the full story.

MIT Technology Review Narrated: How one controversial startup hopes to cool the planet

Stardust Solutions believes that it can solve climate change—for a price.The Israel-based geoengineering startup has said it expects nations will soon pay it more than a billion dollars a year to launch specially equipped aircraft into the stratosphere. Once they’ve reached the necessary altitude, those planes will disperse particles engineered to reflect away enough sunlight to cool down the planet, purportedly without causing environmental side effects.

But numerous solar geoengineering researchers are skeptical that Stardust will line up the customers it needs to carry out a global deployment in the next decade. They’re also highly critical of the idea of a private company setting the global temperature for us.

Inside the decades-long fight over Yahoo’s misdeeds in ChinaWhen you think of Big Tech these days, Yahoo is probably not top of mind. But for Chinese dissident Xu Wanping, the company still looms large—and has for nearly two decades.In 2005, Xu was arrested for signing online petitions relating to anti-Japanese protests. He didn’t use his real name, but he did use his Yahoo email address. Yahoo China violated its users’ trust—providing information on certain email accounts to Chinese law enforcement, which in turn allowed the government to identify and arrest some users.Xu was one of them; he would serve nine years in prison. Now, he and five other Chinese former political prisoners are suing Yahoo and a slate of co-defendants—not because of the company’s information-sharing (which was the focus of an earlier lawsuit filed by other plaintiffs), but rather because of what came after.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">MIT Technology Review Explains: Let our writers untangle the complex, messy world of technology to help you understand what’s coming next. You can read more from the series here.

I am writing this because one of my editors woke up in the middle of the night and scribbled on a bedside notepad: “What is a parameter?” Unlike a lot of thoughts that hit at 4 a.m., it’s a really good question—one that goes right to the heart of how large language models work. And I’m not just saying that because he’s my boss. (Hi, Boss!)

A large language model’s parameters are often said to be the dials and levers that control how it behaves. Think of a planet-size pinball machine that sends its balls pinging from one end to the other via billions of paddles and bumpers set just so. Tweak those settings and the balls will behave in a different way.

OpenAI’s GPT-3, released in 2020, had 175 billion parameters. Google DeepMind’s latest LLM, Gemini 3, may have at least a trillion—some think it’s probably more like 7 trillion—but the company isn’t saying. (With competition now fierce, AI firms no longer share information about how their models are built.)

But the basics of what parameters are and how they make LLMs do the remarkable things that they do are the same across different models. Ever wondered what makes an LLM really tick—what’s behind the colorful pinball-machine metaphors? Let’s dive in.

Think back to middle school algebra, like 2a + b. Those letters are parameters: Assign them values and you get a result. In math or coding, parameters are used to set limits or determine output. The parameters inside LLMs work in a similar way, just on a mind-boggling scale.

Short answer: an algorithm. When a model is trained, each parameter is set to a random value. The training process then involves an iterative series of calculations (known as training steps) that update those values. In the early stages of training, a model will make errors. The training algorithm looks at each error and goes back through the model, tweaking the value of each of the model’s many parameters so that next time that error is smaller. This happens over and over again until the model behaves in the way its makers want it to. At that point, training stops and the values of the model’s parameters are fixed.

In theory! In practice, because LLMs are trained on so much data and contain so many parameters, training them requires a huge number of steps and an eye-watering amount of computation. During training, the 175 billion parameters inside a medium-size LLM like GPT-3 will each get updated tens of thousands of times. In total, that adds up to quadrillions (a number with 15 zeros) of individual calculations. That’s why training an LLM takes so much energy. We’re talking about thousands of specialized high-speed computers running nonstop for months.

There are three different types of parameters inside an LLM that get their values assigned through training: embeddings, weights, and biases. Let’s take each of those in turn.

An embedding is the mathematical representation of a word (or part of a word, known as a token) in an LLM’s vocabulary. An LLM’s vocabulary, which might contain up to a few hundred thousand unique tokens, is set by its designers before training starts. But there’s no meaning attached to those words. That comes during training.

When a model is trained, each word in its vocabulary is assigned a numerical value that captures the meaning of that word in relation to all the other words, based on how the word appears in countless examples across the model’s training data.

Yeah. But there’s a bit more to it. The numerical value—the embedding—that represents each word is in fact a list of numbers, with each number in the list representing a different facet of meaning that the model has extracted from its training data. The length of this list of numbers is another thing that LLM designers can specify before an LLM is trained. A common size is 4,096.

Yup, that’s an embedding. And each of those numbers is tweaked during training. An LLM with embeddings that are 4,096 numbers long is said to have 4,096 dimensions.

It might look like a strange number. But LLMs (like anything that runs on a computer chip) work best with powers of two—2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, and so on. LLM engineers have found that 4,096 is a power of two that hits a sweet spot between capability and efficiency. Models with fewer dimensions are less capable; models with more dimensions are too expensive or slow to train and run.

Using more numbers allows the LLM to capture very fine-grained information about how a word is used in many different contexts, what subtle connotations it might have, how it relates to other words, and so on.

Back in February, OpenAI released GPT-4.5, the firm’s largest LLM yet (some estimates have put its parameter count at more than 10 trillion). Nick Ryder, a research scientist at OpenAI who worked on the model, told me at the time that bigger models can work with extra information, like emotional cues, such as when a speaker’s words signal hostility: “All of these subtle patterns that come through a human conversation—those are the bits that these larger and larger models will pick up on.”

The upshot is that all the words inside an LLM get encoded into a high-dimensional space. Picture thousands of words floating in the air around you. Words that are closer together have similar meanings. For example, “table” and “chair” will be closer to each other than they are to “astronaut,” which is close to “moon” and “Musk.” Way off in the distance you can see “prestidigitation.” It’s a little like that, but instead of being related to each other across three dimensions, the words inside an LLM are related across 4,096 dimensions.

It’s dizzying stuff. In effect, an LLM compresses the entire internet into a single monumental mathematical structure that encodes an unfathomable amount of interconnected information. It’s both why LLMs can do astonishing things and why they’re impossible to fully understand.

A weight is a parameter that represents the strength of a connection between different parts of a model—and one of the most common types of dial for tuning a model’s behavior. Weights are used when an LLM processes text.

When an LLM reads a sentence (or a book chapter), it first looks up the embeddings for all the words and then passes those embeddings through a series of neural networks, known as transformers, that are designed to process sequences of data (like text) all at once. Every word in the sentence gets processed in relation to every other word.

This is where weights come in. An embedding represents the meaning of a word without context. When a word appears in a specific sentence, transformers use weights to process the meaning of that word in that new context. (In practice, this involves multiplying each embedding by the weights for all other words.)

Biases are another type of dial that complement the effects of the weights. Weights set the thresholds at which different parts of a model fire (and thus pass data on to the next part). Biases are used to adjust those thresholds so that an embedding can trigger activity even when its value is low. (Biases are values that are added to an embedding rather than multiplied with it.)

By shifting the thresholds at which parts of a model fire, biases allow the model to pick up information that might otherwise be missed. Imagine you’re trying to hear what somebody is saying in a noisy room. Weights would amplify the loudest voices the most; biases are like a knob on a listening device that pushes quieter voices up in the mix.

Here’s the TL;DR: Weights and biases are two different ways that an LLM extracts as much information as it can out of the text it is given. And both types of parameters are adjusted over and over again during training to make sure they do this.

No, neurons are more a way to organize all this math—containers for the weights and biases, strung together by a web of pathways between them. It’s all very loosely inspired by biological neurons inside animal brains, with signals from one neuron triggering new signals from the next and so on.

Each neuron in a model holds a single bias and weights for every one of the model’s dimensions. In other words, if a model has 4,096 dimensions—and therefore its embeddings are lists of 4,096 numbers—then each of the neurons in that model will hold one bias and 4,096 weights.

Neurons are arranged in layers. In most LLMs, each neuron in one layer is connected to every neuron in the layer above. A 175-billion-parameter model like GPT-3 might have around 100 layers with a few tens of thousands of neurons in each layer. And each neuron is running tens of thousands of computations at a time.

When an LLM processes a piece of text, the numerical representation of that text—the embedding—gets passed through multiple layers of the model. In each layer, the value of the embedding (that list of 4,096 numbers) gets updated many times by a series of computations involving the model’s weights and biases (attached to the neurons) until it gets to the final layer.

The idea is that all the meaning and nuance and context of that input text is captured by the final value of the embedding after it has gone through a mind-boggling series of computations. That value is then used to calculate the next word that the LLM should spit out.

It won’t be a surprise that this is more complicated than it sounds: The model in fact calculates, for every word in its vocabulary, how likely that word is to come next and ranks the results. It then picks the top word. (Kind of. See below …)

That word is appended to the previous block of text, and the whole process repeats until the LLM calculates that the most likely next word to spit out is one that signals the end of its output.

LLM designers can also specify a handful of other parameters, known as hyperparameters. The main ones are called temperature, top-p, and top-k.

Temperature is a parameter that acts as a kind of creativity dial. It influences the model’s choice of what word comes next. I just said that the model ranks the words in its vocabulary and picks the top one. But the temperature parameter can be used to push the model to choose the most probable next word, making its output more factual and relevant, or a less probable word, making the output more surprising and less robotic.

Top-p and top-k are two more dials that control the model’s choice of next words. They are settings that force the model to pick a word at random from a pool of most probable words instead of the top word. These parameters affect how the model comes across—quirky and creative versus trustworthy and dull.

That’s one of the hottest questions in AI right now. There are a lot of different ways it can happen. Researchers have found that the amount of training data makes a huge difference. First you need to make sure the model sees enough data: An LLM trained on too little text won’t make the most of all its parameters, and a smaller model trained on the same amount of data could outperform it.

Another trick researchers have hit on is overtraining. Showing models far more data than previously thought necessary seems to make them perform better. The result is that a small model trained on a lot of data can outperform a larger model trained on less data. Take Meta’s Llama LLMs. The 70-billion-parameter Llama 2 was trained on around 2 trillion words of text; the 8-billion-parameter Llama 3 was trained on around 15 trillion words of text. The far smaller Llama 3 is the better model.

A third technique, known as distillation, uses a larger model to train a smaller one. The smaller model is trained not only on the raw training data but also on the outputs of the larger model’s internal computations. The idea is that the hard-won lessons encoded in the parameters of the larger model trickle down into the parameters of the smaller model, giving it a boost.

In fact, the days of single monolithic models may be over. Even the largest models on the market, like OpenAI’s GPT-5 and Google DeepMind’s Gemini 3, can be thought of as several small models in a trench coat. Using a technique called “mixture of experts,” large models can turn on just the parts of themselves (the “experts”) that are required to process a specific piece of text. This combines the abilities of a large model with the speed and lower power consumption of a small one.

But that’s not the end of it. Researchers are still figuring out ways to get the most out of a model’s parameters. As the gains from straight-up scaling tail off, jacking up the number of parameters no longer seems to make the difference it once did. It’s not so much how many you have, but what you do with them.

You want to see a parameter? Knock yourself out: Here&#39;s an embedding.

            <p><strong>MIT Technology Review | 2026-01-07</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2026/01/07/1129748/aadhaar-nandan-nilekani-india-digital-biometric-identity-data/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Nandan Nilekani can’t stop trying to push India into the future. He started nearly 30 years ago, masterminding an ongoing experiment in technological state capacity that started with Aadhaar—the world’s largest digital identity system. Aadhaar means “foundation” in Hindi, and on that bedrock Nilekani and people working with him went on to build a sprawling collection of free, interoperating online tools that add up to nothing less than a digital infrastructure for society. They cover government services, digital payments, banking, credit, and health care, offering convenience and access that would be eye-popping in wealthy countries a tenth of India’s size. In India those systems are called, collectively, “digital public infrastructure,” or DPI.

At 70 years old, Nilekani should be retired. But he has a few more ideas. India’s electrical grid is creaky and prone to failure; Nilekani wants to add a layer of digital communication to stabilize it. And then there’s his idea to expand the financial functions in DPI to the rest of the world, creating a global digital backbone for commerce that he calls the “finternet.”

“It sounds like some crazy stuff,” Nilekani says. “But I think these are all big ideas, which over the next five years will have demonstrable, material impact.” As a last act in public life, why not Aadhaarize the world?

Today, a farmer in a village in India, hours from the nearest bank, can collect welfare payments or transfer money by simply pressing a thumb to a fingerprint scanner at the local store. Digitally authenticated copies of driver’s licenses, birth certificates, and educational records can be accessed and shared via a digital wallet that sits on your smartphone.

In big cities, where cash is less and less common (just trying to break a bill can be a major headache), mobile payments are ubiquitous, whether you’re buying a TV from a high-street retailer or a coconut from a roadside cart. There are no fees, and any payment app or bank account can send money to any other. The country’s chaotic patchwork of public and private hospitals have begun digitizing all their medical records and uploading them to a nationwide platform. On the Open Network for Digital Commerce (ONDC), people can do online shopping searches on whatever app they want, and the results show sellers from an array of other platforms, too. The idea is to liberate small merchants and consumers from the walled gardens of online shopping giants like Amazon and the domestic giant Flipkart.

In the most populous nation on Earth—with 1.4 billion people—a large portion of the bureaucracy anyone encounters in daily life happens seamlessly and in the cloud.

At the heart of all these tools is Aadhaar. The system gives every Indian a 12-digit number that, in combination with either a fingerprint scan or an SMS code, allows access to government services, SIM cards, basic bank accounts, digital signature services, and social welfare payments. The Indian government says that since its inception in 2009, Aadhaar has saved 3.48 trillion rupees ($39.2 billion) by boosting efficiency, bypassing corrupt officials, and cutting other types of fraud. The system is controversial and imperfect—a database with 1.4 billion people in it comes with inherent security and privacy concerns. Still, in the most populous nation on Earth, a big portion of the bureaucracy anyone might encounter in daily life just happens in the cloud.

Nilekani was behind much of that innovation, marshaling an army of civil servants, tech companies, and volunteers. Now he sees it in action every day. “It reinforces that what you have done is not some abstract stuff, but real stuff for real people,” he says.

By his own admission, Nilekani is entering the twilight of his career. But it’s not over yet. He’s now “chief mentor” for the India Energy Stack (IES), a government initiative to connect the fragmented data held by companies responsible for generating, transmitting, and distributing power. India’s grids are unstable and disparate, but Nilekani hopes an Aadhaar-like move will help. IES aims to give unique digital identities not only to power plants and energy storage facilities but even to rooftop solar panels and electric vehicles. All the data attached to those things—device characteristics, energy rating certifications, usage information—will be in a common, machine-readable format and shared on the same open protocols.

Ideally, that’ll give grid operators a real-time view of energy supply and demand. And if it works, it might also make it simpler and cheaper for anyone to connect to the grid—even everyday folks selling excess power from their rooftop solar rigs, says RS Sharma, the chair of the project and Nilekani’s deputy while building Aadhaar.

Nilekani’s other side hustle is even more ambitious. His idea for a global “finternet” combines Aadhaarization with blockchains—creating digital representations called tokens for not only financial instruments like stocks or bonds but also real-world assets like houses or jewelry. Anyone from a bank to an asset manager or even a company could create and manage these tokens, but Nilekani’s team especially hopes the idea will help poor people trade their assets, or use them as loan collateral—expanding financial services to those who otherwise couldn’t access them.

It sounds almost wild-eyed. Yet the finternet project has 30 partners across four continents. Nilekani says it’ll launch next year.

Nilekani was born in Bengaluru, in 1955. His family was middle class and, Nilekani says, “seized with societal issues and challenges.” His upbringing was also steeped in the kind of socialism espoused by the newish nation’s first prime minister, Jawaharlal Nehru.

After studying electrical engineering at the Indian Institute of Technology, in 1981 Nilekani helped found Infosys, an information technology company that pioneered outsourcing and helped turned India into the world’s IT back office. In 1999, he was part of a government-appointed task force trying to upgrade the infrastructure and services in Bengaluru, then emerging as India’s tech capital. But Nilekani was at the time leery of being viewed as just another techno-optimist. “I didn’t want to be seen as naive enough to believe that tech could solve everything,” he says.

Seeing the scope of the problem changed his mind—sclerotic bureaucracy, endemic corruption, and financial exclusion were intractable without technological solutions. In 2008 Nilekani published a book, Imagining India: The Idea of a Renewed Nation. It was a manifesto for an India that could leapfrog into a networked future.

And it got him a job. At the time more than half the births in the country were not recorded, and up to 400 million Indians had no official identity document. Manmohan Singh, the prime minister, asked Nilekani to put into action an ill-defined plan to create a national identity card.

Nilekani’s team made a still-controversial decision to rely on biometrics. A system based on people’s fingerprints and retina scans meant nobody could sign up twice, and nobody had to carry paperwork. In terms of execution, it was like trying to achieve industrialization but skip a steam era. Deployment required a monumental data collection effort, as well as new infrastructure that could compare each new enrollment against hundreds of millions of existing records in seconds. At its peak, the Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI), the agency responsible for administering Aadhaar, was registering more than a million new users a day. That happened with a technical team of just about 50 developers, and in the end cost slightly less than half a billion dollars.

Buoyed by their success, Nilekani and his allies started casting around for other problems they could solve using the same digitize-the-real-world playbook. “We built more and more layers of capability,” Nilekani says, “and then this became a wider-ranging idea. More grandiose.”

While other countries were building digital backbones with full state control (as in China) or in public-private partnerships that favored profit-seeking corporate approaches (as in the US), Nilekani thought India needed something else. He wanted critical technologies in areas like identity, payments, and data sharing to be open and interoperable, not monopolized by either the state or private industry. So the tools that make up DPI use open standards and open APIs, meaning that anyone can plug into the system. No single company or institution controls access—no walled gardens.

Of course, another way to look at putting financial and government services and records into giant databases is that it’s a massive risk to personal liberty. Aadhaar, in particular, has faced criticism from privacy advocates concerned about the potential for surveillance. Several high-profile data breaches of Aadhaar records held by government entities have shaken confidence in the system, most recently in 2023, when security researchers found hackers selling the records of more than 800 million Indians on the dark web.

Technically, this shouldn’t matter—an Aadhaar number ought to be useless without biometric or SMS-based authentication. It’s “a myth that this random number is a very powerful number,” says Sharma, the onetime co-lead of UIDAI. “I don’t have any example where somebody’s Aadhaar disclosure would have harmed somebody.”

One problem is that in everyday use, Aadhaar users often bypass the biometric authentication system. To ensure that people use a genuine address at registration, Aadhaar administrators give people their numbers on an official-looking document. Indians co-opted this paperwork as a proof of identity on its own. And since the document—Indians even call it an “Aadhaar card”—doesn’t have an expiration date, it’s possible for people to get multiple valid cards with different details by changing their address or date of birth. That’s quite a loophole. In 2018 an NGO report found that 67% of people using Aadhaar to open a bank account relied on this verification document rather than digital authentication. That report was the last time anyone published data on the problem, so nobody knows how bad it is today. “Everybody’s living on anecdotes,” says Kiran Jonnalagadda, an anti-Aadhaar activist.

In other cases, flaws in Aadhaar’s biometric technology have caused people to be denied essential government services. The government downplays these risks, but again, it’s impossible to tell how serious the problem is because the UIDAI won’t disclose numbers. “There needs to be a much more honest acknowledgment, documentation, and then an examination of how those exclusions can be mitigated,” says Apar Gupta, director of the Internet Freedom Foundation.

Beyond the potential for fraud, it’s also true that the free and interoperable tools haven’t reached all the people who might find them useful, especially among India’s rural and poorer populations. Nilekani’s hopes for openness haven’t fully come to pass. Big e-commerce companies still dominate, and retail sales on ONDC have been dropping steadily since 2024, when financial incentives to participate began to taper off. The digital payments and government documentation services have hundreds of millions of users, numbers most global technology companies would love to see—but in a country as large as India, that leaves a lot of people out.

The usually calm Nilekani bristles at that criticism; he has heard it before. Detractors overlook the dysfunction that preceded these efforts, he says, and he remains convinced that technology was the only way forward. “How do you move a country of 1.4 billion people?” he asks. “There’s no other way you can fix it.”

The proof is self-evident, he says. Indians have opened more than 500 million basic bank accounts using Aadhaar; before it came into use, millions of those people had been completely unbanked. Earlier this year, India’s Unified Payments Interface overtook Visa as the world’s largest real-time payments system. “There is no way Aadhaar could have worked but for the fact that people needed this thing,” Nilekani says. “There’s no way payments would have worked without people needing it. So the voice of the people—they’re voting with their feet.”

That need might be present in countries beyond India. “Many countries don’t have a proper birth registration system. Many countries don’t have a payment system. Many countries don’t have a way for data to be leveraged,” Nilekani says. “So this is a very powerful idea.” It seems to be spreading. Foreign governments regularly send delegations to Bengaluru to study India’s DPI tools. The World Bank and the United Nations have tried to introduce the concept to other developing countries equally eager to bring their economies into the digital age. The Gates Foundation has established projects to promote digital infrastructure, and Nilekani has set up and funded a network of think tanks, research institutes, and other NGOs aimed at, as he says, “propagating the gospel.”

Still, he admits he might not live to see DPI go global. “There are two races,” Nilekani says. “My personal race against time and India’s race against time.” He worries that the economic potential of its vast young population—the so-called demographic dividend—could turn into a demographic disaster. Despite rapid growth, gains have been uneven. Youth unemployment remains stubbornly high—a particularly volatile problem in a large and economically turbulent country.

“Maybe I’m a junkie,” he says. “Why the hell am I doing all this? I think I need it. I think I need to keep curious and alive and looking at the future.” But that’s the thing about building the future: It never quite arrives.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Water shortages in Southern California made an indelible impression on Evelyn Wang ’00 when she was growing up in Los Angeles. “I was quite young, perhaps in first grade,” she says. “But I remember we weren’t allowed to turn our sprinklers on. And everyone in the neighborhood was given disinfectant tablets for the toilet and encouraged to keep flushing to a minimum. I didn’t understand exactly what was happening. But I saw that everyone in the community was affected by the scarcity of this resource.”

Today, as extreme weather events increasingly affect communities around the world, Wang is leading MIT’s effort to tackle the interlinked challenges of a changing climate and a burgeoning global demand for energy. Last April, after wrapping up a two-year stint directing the US Department of Energy’s Advanced Research Projects Agency–Energy (ARPA-E), she returned to the campus where she’d been both an undergraduate and a faculty member to become the inaugural vice president for energy and climate.

“The accelerating problem of climate change and its countless impacts represent the greatest scientific, technical, and policy challenge of this or any age,” MIT President Sally Kornbluth wrote in a January 2025 letter to the MIT community announcing the appointment. “We are tremendously fortunate that Evelyn Wang has agreed to lead this crucial work.”

MIT has studied and worked on problems of climate and energy for decades. In recent years, with temperatures rising, storms strengthening, and energy demands surging, that work has expanded and intensified, spawning myriad research projects, policy proposals, papers, and startups. The challenges are so urgent that MIT launched several Institute-wide initiatives, including President Rafael Reif’s Climate Grand Challenges (2020) and President Kornbluth’s Climate Project (2024).

But Kornbluth has argued that MIT needs to do even more. Her creation of the new VP-level post that Wang now holds underscores that commitment.

Wang is well suited for the role. The Ford Professor of Engineering at MIT and former head of the Department of Mechanical Engineering, she joined the faculty in 2007, shortly after she completed her PhD at Stanford University. Her research centers on thermal management and energy conversion and storage, but she also works on nano-engineered surfaces and materials, as well as water harvesting and purification. Wang and her colleagues have produced a device based on nanophotonic crystals that could double the efficiency of solar cells—one of MIT Technology Review’s 10 breakthrough technologies of 2017. And the device she invented with Nobel laureate Omar Yaghi for extracting water from very dry air was named one of 2017’s top 10 emerging technologies by Scientific American and the World Economic Forum, and in 2018 earned her the Prince Sultan Bin Abdulaziz International Prize for Water. (See story on this water harvesting research in the January/February issue of MIT Technology Review.)

Wang has a deep knowledge of the Institute—and even deeper roots here. (See “Family Ties,” MIT Alumni News, March/April 2015.) Her parents met at MIT as PhD students from Taiwan in the 1960s; they were married in the MIT chapel. When Wang arrived at MIT in 1996 as a first-year student, her brother Alex ’96, MEng ’97, had just graduated and was working on a master’s degree in electrical engineering. Her other brother, Ben, would earn his PhD at MIT in 2007. She even met her husband, Russell Sammon ’98, at MIT. Apart from her time at ARPA-E, a very brief stint at Bell Labs, and sabbatical work at Google, she has spent her entire professional career at the Institute. So she has a rare perspective on the resources MIT can draw on to respond to the climate and energy challenge.

“The beating heart of MIT is innovation,” she says. “We are innovators. And innovation is something that will help us leapfrog some of the potential hurdles as we work toward climate and energy solutions. Our ability to innovate can enable us to move closer toward energy security, toward sustainable resource development and use.”

The prevailing innovative mindset at MIT is backed by a deep desire to tackle the problem.Many people on campus are passionate about climate and energy, says Wang. “That is why President Kornbluth made this her flagship initiative. We are fortunate to have so many talented students and faculty, and to be able to rely on our infrastructure. I know they will all step up to meet the challenges.” But she is quick to point out that the problems are too large for any one entity—including MIT—to address on its own. So she’s aiming to encourage more collaboration both among MIT researchers and with other institutions.

“If we want to solve this problem of climate change, if we want to change the trajectory in the next decade, we cannot continue to do business as usual,” she says. “That is what is most exciting about this problem and, frankly, is why I came back to campus to take this job.”

The coupling of climate and energy in Wang’s portfolio is strategic. “Energy and climate are two sides of the same coin,” she explains. “A major reason we are seeing climate change is that we haven’t deployed solutions at a scale necessary to mitigate the CO2 emissions from the energy sector. The ways we generate energy and manage emissions are fundamental to any strategy addressing climate change. At the same time, the world demands more and more energy—a demand we can’t possibly meet through a single means.”

“Zero-emissions and low-carbon approaches will not be enough to supply the necessary energy or to reverse our impact on the climate … We need to do something truly transformational. That is the heart of the challenge.”

What’s more, she contends that switching from fossil fuels to cleaner energy, while fundamental, is only part of the solution. “Zero-emissions and low-­carbon approaches will not be enough to supply the necessary energy or to reverse our impact on the climate,” she says. “We need to consider the environmental impacts of these new fuels we develop and deploy. We need to use data analysis to move goods and energy more efficiently and intelligently. We need to consider raising more of our food in water and using food by-products and waste to help sequester carbon. In short, we need to do something truly transformational. That is the heart of the challenge.”

That challenge seems destined to grow more daunting in the coming years. There are still, Wang observes, areas of “energy poverty”—places where people cannot access sufficient energy to sustain their well-being. But solving that problem will only drive up energy production and consumption worldwide. The explosive growth of AI will likely do the same, since the huge data centers that power the technology require enormous quantities of energy for both computation and cooling.

Wang believes that while AI will continue to drive electricity demand, it can also contribute to creating a more sustainable future.“We can use AI to develop climate and energy solutions,” she says. “AI can play a primary role in solution sets, can give us new and improved ways to manage intermittent loads in the energy grid. It can help us develop new catalysts and chemicals or help us stabilize the plasma we’ll use in nuclear fusion. It could augment climate and geospatial modeling that would allow us to predict the impact of potential climate solutions before we implement them. We could even use AI to reduce computational needs and thereby ease cooling demand.”

MIT was humming with climate and energy research long before Wang returned to campus in 2025 after wrapping up her work at ARPA-E. Almost 400 researchers across 90% of MIT’s departments responded to President Reif’s 2020 Climate Grand Challenges initiative. The Institute awarded $2.7 million to 27 finalist teams and identified five flagship projects, including one to create an early warning system to help mitigate the impact of climate disasters, another to predict and prepare for extreme weather events, and an ambitious project to slash nearly half of all industrial carbon emissions.

About 250 MIT faculty and senior researchers are now involved in the Climate Project at MIT, a campus-wide initiative launched in 2024 that works to generate and implement climate solutions, tools, and policy proposals. Conceived to bolster MIT’s already significant efforts as a leading source of technological, behavioral, and policy solutions to global climate issues, the Climate Project has identified six “missions”: decarbonizing energy and industry; preserving the atmosphere, land, and oceans; empowering frontline community action; designing resilient and prosperous cities; enabling new policy approaches; and wild cards, a catch-all category that supports development of unconventional solutions outside the scope of the other missions. Faculty members direct each mission.

With so much climate research already underway,a large part of Wang’s new role is to support and deepen existing projects. But to fully tap into MIT’s unique capabilities, she says, she’s aiming to foster some cultural shifts. And that begins with identifying ways to facilitate cooperation—both across the Institute and with external partners—on a scale that can make “something truly transformational” happen, she says. “At this stage, with the challenges we face in energy and climate, we need to do something ambitious.”

In Wang’s view, getting big results depends on taking a big-picture, holistic approach that will require unprecedented levels of collaboration. “MIT faculty have always treasured their independence and autonomy,” she says. “Traditionally, we’ve tried to let 1,000 flowers bloom. And traditionally we’ve done that well, often with outstanding results. But climate and energy are systems problems, which means we need to create a systems solution. How do we bring these diverse faculty together? How do we align their efforts, not just in technology, but also in policy, science, finance, and social sciences?”

To encourage MIT faculty to collaborate across departments, schools, and disciplines, Wang recently announced that the MIT Climate Project would award grants of $50,000 to $250,000 to collaborative faculty teams that work on six- to 24-month climate research projects. Student teams are invited to apply for research grants of up to $15,000.“We can’t afford to work in silos,” she says. “People from wildly diverse fields are working on the same problems and speaking different professional languages. We need to bring people together in an integrative way so we can attack the problem holistically.”

Wang also wants colleagues to reach beyond campus. MIT, she says, needs to form real, defined partnerships with other universities, as well as with industries, investors, and philanthropists. “This isn’t just an MIT problem,” she says. “Individual efforts and 1,000 flowers alone will not be enough to meet these challenges.”

Thinking holistically—and in terms of systems—will help focus efforts on the areas that will have the greatest impact. At a Climate Project presentation in October, Wang outlined an approach that would focus on building well-being within communities. This will begin with efforts to empower communities by developing coastal resilience, to decarbonize ports and shipping, and to design and build data centers that integrate smoothly and sustainably with nearby communities. She encouraged her colleagues to think in terms of big-picture solutions for the future and then to work on the components needed to build that future.

“As researchers, we sometimes jump to a solution before we have fully defined the problem,” she explains. “Let’s take the problem of decarbonization in transportation. The solution we’ve come up with is to electrify our vehicles. When we run up against the problem of the range of these vehicles, our first thought is to create higher-density batteries. But the real problem we’re facing isn’t about batteries. It’s about increasing the range of these vehicles. And the solution to that problem isn’t necessarily a more powerful battery.”

“Too often the narrative around climate is steeped in doom and gloom … The goal of any climate project is to build and protect well-being. How can we help communities thrive, empower people to live as they wish, even as the climate is changing?”

Wang is confident that her MIT colleagues have both the capacity and the desire to embrace the holistic approach she envisions. “When I was accepted to MIT as an undergraduate and visited the campus, the thing that made me certain I wanted to enroll here was the people,” she recalls. “They weren’t just talented. They had so many different interests. They were passionate about solving big problems. And they were eager to learn from one another. That spirit hasn’t changed. And that’s the spirit I and my team can tap into.”

Wang believes MIT and other institutions working on climate and energy solutions also need to change how we talk about the challenge. “Too often the narrative around climate is steeped in doom and gloom,” she says. “The underlying issue here is our well-being. That’s what we care about, not the climate. The goal of any climate project is to build and protect well-being. How can we help communities thrive, empower people to live as they wish, even as the climate is changing? How can we create conditions of resilience, sustainability, and prosperity? That is the framework I would like us to build on.” For example, in areas where extreme weather threatens homes or rising temperatures are harming human health, we should be developing affordable technologies that make dwellings more resilient and keep people cooler.

Wang’s colleagues at MIT concur with her assessment of the mission ahead. They also have a deep respect for her scholarship and leadership. “I couldn’t think of a better person to represent MIT’s diverse and powerful ability to attack climate,” says Susan Solomon, the Lee and Geraldine Martin Professor of Environmental Studies at MIT and recipient of the US National Medal of Science for her work on the Antarctic ozone hole. “Communicating MIT’s capabilities to provide what the nation needs—not only in engineering but also in … economics, the physical, chemical, and biological sciences, and much more—is an immense challenge.” But she’s confident that Wang will do it justice. “Evelyn is a consummate storyteller,” she says.

“She’s tremendously quick at learning new fields and driving toward what the real nuggets are that need to be addressed in solving hard problems,” says Elsa Olivetti, PhD ’07, the Jerry McAfee Professor in Engineering and director of the MIT Climate Project’s Decarbonizing Energy and Industry mission. “Her direct, meticulous thinking and leadership style mean that she can focus teams within her office to do the work that will be most impactful at scale.”

Wang’s experience at ARPA-E is expected to be especially useful. “The current geopolitical situation and the limited amount of research funding available relative to the scale of the climate problem pose formidable challenges to bringing MIT’s strengths to bear on the problem,” says Rohit Karnik, director of the Abdul Latif Jameel Water and Food Systems Lab (J-WAFS) and a collaborator with Wang on numerous projects and initiatives since both joined the mechanical engineering faculty in 2007. “Evelyn’s leadership experience at MIT and in government, her ability to take a complex situation and define a clear vision, and her passion to make a difference will serve her well in her new role.”

Wang’s new MIT appointment is seen as a good thing beyond the Institute as well. “A role like this requires a skill set that is difficult to find in one individual,” says Krista Walton, vice chancellor for research and innovation at North Carolina State University. Walton and Wang collaborated on multiple projects, including the DARPA work that produced the device for extracting water from very dry air based on the original prototype Wang co-developed. “You need scientific depth, an understanding of the federal and global landscape, a collaborative instinct and the ability to be a convener, and a strategic vision,” Walton says—and she can’t imagine a better pick for the job.

“Evelyn has an extraordinary ability to bridge fundamental science with real-world application,” she says. “She approaches collaboration as a true partnership and not as a transaction.”

Climate scientists explore broad swaths of time, tracking trends in temperature, greenhouse gases, volcanic activity, vegetation, and more across hundreds, thousands, and even millions of years. Even average temperatures and precipitation levels are calculated over periods of three decades.

But in the realm of politics, change happens much faster, prompting sudden and sometimes startling shifts in culture and policy. The current US administration has proposed widespread budget cuts in climate and energy research. These have included slicing more than $1.5 billion from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), canceling multiple climate-related missions at NASA, and shuttering the US Global Change Research Program (USGCRP), the agency responsible for publishing the National Climate Assessment. The Trump administration submitted a budget request that would cut the National Science Foundation budget from more than $9 billion to just over $4 billion for 2026. The New York Times reported that NSF grant funding for STEM education from January through mid-May 2025 was down 80% from its 10-year average, while NSF grant awards for math, physics, chemistry, astronomy, and materials science research were down 67%. In September, the US Department of Energy announced it had terminated 223 projects that “did not adequately advance the nation’s energy needs, were not economically viable, and would not provide a positive return on investment of taxpayer dollars.” Among the agencies affected is ARPA-E, the agency Wang directed before returning to MIT. Meanwhile, MIT research programs that rely on government sources of funding will also feel the impact of the cuts.

Acknowledging the difficulties she and MIT may face in the present moment, Wang still prefers to look forward. “Of course this is a challenging time,” she says. “There are near-term challenges and long-term challenges. We need to focus on those long-term challenges. As President Kornbluth has said, we need to continue to advocate for research and education. We need to pursue long-term solutions, to follow our convictions in addressing problems in energy and climate. And we need to be ready to seize the opportunities that reside in these long-term challenges.”

Wang also sees openings for short-term collaboration—areas where MIT and the current administration can find common ground and goals. “There is still a huge area of opportunity for us to align our interests with those of this administration,” she says. “We can move the needle forward together on energy, on national security, on minerals, on economic competitiveness. All these are interests we share, and there are pathways we can follow to meet these challenges to our nation together. MIT is a major force in the nuclear space, in both fission and fusion. These, along with geothermal, could provide the power base we need to meet our energy demands. There are significant opportunities for partnerships with this or any administration to unlock some of these innovations and implement them.”

While she views herself as a researcher and an academic, Wang’s relevant government experience should prove especially useful in her VP role at MIT. In her two years as director of ARPA-E, she coordinated a broad array of the US Department of Energy’s early-stage research and development in energy generation, storage, and use. “I think I had the best job in government,” she says. Designed to operate at arm’s length from the Department of Energy, ARPA-E searches for high-risk, high-reward energy innovation projects. “More than one observer has called ARPA-E a moonshot factory,” she says.

Seeking out and facilitating “moonshot”-­worthy projects at a national and sometimes global scale gave Wang a broader lens through which to view issues of energy and climate. It also taught her that big ideas do not translate into big solutions automatically. “I learned what it takes to make an impact on energy technology at ARPA-E and I will be forever grateful,” she says. “I saw how game-changing ideas can take a decade to go from concept to deployment. I learned to appreciate the diversity of talent and innovation in the national ecosystem composed of laboratories, startups, and institutions. I saw how that ecosystem could zero in to identify real problems, envision diverse pathways, and create prototypes. And I also saw just how hard that journey is.”

MIT researchers are tackling climate and energy issues from multiple angles, working on everything from decarbonizing energy and industry to designing resilient and prosperous cities. Find out more at climateproject.mit.edu.

While MIT is already an important element in that ecosystem, Wang and her colleagues want the Institute to play an even more prominent role. “We can be a convener and collaborator, first across all of MIT’s departments, and then with industry, the financial world, and governments,” she says. “We need to do aggressive outreach and find like-minded partners.”

“Although the problems of climate and climate change are global, the most effective way MIT can address them is locally,” said Wang at the October presentation of the MIT Climate Project. “Working across schools and disciplines, collaborating with external partners, we will develop targeted solutions for individual places and communities—solutions that can then serve as templates for other places and communities.” But she also cautions against one-size-fits-all solutions. “Solar panels, for example, work wonderfully, but only in areas that have sufficient space and sunlight,” she explains. “Institutions like MIT can showcase a diversity of approaches and determine the best approach for each individual context.”

Most of all, Wang wants her colleagues to be proactive. “Because MIT is a factory of ideas, perhaps even a moonshot factory, we need to think boldly and continue to think boldly so we can make an impact as soon as possible,” she says. She also wants her colleagues to stay hopeful and not feel daunted by a challenge that can at times feel overwhelming. “We will build pilots, one at a time, and demonstrate that these projects are not only possible but practical,” she says. “And that is how we will build a future everyone wants to live in.”

            <div id="article-text">Few people, if any, contemplate stars—celestial or cinematic—the way Aomawa Shields does.

An astronomer and astrobiologist, Shields explores the potential habitability of planets beyond our solar system. But she is also a classically trained actor—and that’s helped shape her professional trajectory in unexpected ways.

Today, Shields is an associate professor in the Department of Physics and Astronomy at the University of California, Irvine, where she oversees a research team that uses computer models to explore conditions on exoplanets, or planets that revolve around stars other than the sun. But while searching for life many light-years away is her day job, creative endeavors round out her purpose on Earth.

In 2023 Shields published a memoir, Life on Other Planets: A Memoir of Finding My Place in the Universe. She has started an influential educational program that encourages young girls to explore space, given a hugely popular TED Talk about how we’ll find life on other planets, and won a string of prestigious academic awards, honors, and grants. She also plays the violin, cooks, practices yoga, and is a mom. And as what she calls a “rest leader”—a professional proponent of slowing down—Shields has somehow managed the seemingly impossible: She makes time.

Her unorthodox path began on the screen, in the realm of make-believe.

“I wanted to become an astronaut. That dream started very early in my life, at the age of 12, after seeing a movie that dramatized kids getting launched into space,” she says, referring to SpaceCamp, an ’80s kids’ comedy about an accidental space shuttle flight.

The next bit of cinematic inspiration cemented her interest.

“Charlotte Blackwood was an astrophysicist, and she was very glamorous, too,” Shields says, smiling at how she was captivated by the heroine in Top Gun. “There’s an iconic scene where she’s walking down the aisle between Tom Cruise and other pilot trainees, and she just kind of whips off her glasses and just looks like such a badass.”

A high-achieving student while growing up in California, Canada, and Massachusetts, Shields made her way to Phillips Exeter Academy, in large part drawn by its state-of-the-art astronomical observatory. Once there, she got pulled into acting in a serious way. “Enter a new dream,” she says.

Throughout high school her astronomy and acting aspirations “kind of danced beside each other,” Shields remembers. “But I held firm to the first one and went to MIT because I understood that it’s the best science school in the country. I learned that at the age of 12—that’s where I’m going to go.”

At MIT, Shields struggled academically at first and took refuge in the creative arts. She was chosen to participate in the Burchard Scholars Program, whose monthly dinner seminars bring faculty members together with students who excel in the arts, social sciences, and humanities. She sang in the a cappella group the Muses and performed in lots of plays. At the end of her senior year, she found herself wondering: “Do I go to grad school in acting or astronomy?”

“There were a lot of these things that seemed to be aligning—that were telling me: Go back and get that PhD.”

The latter won out, but not for long. Shields headed to a graduate program in astronomy at the University of Wisconsin–Madison. “During that year, I had a white male professor tell me to consider other career options, and that was hard to hear,” she says. She remembers thinking, “I’m going to the other dream because clearly someone’s telling me that I don’t belong here. Maybe they’re right.”

So she applied to UCLA, where she got an MFA in acting, leaving astronomy for more than a decade. But then, when Shields was working odd jobs to supplement her acting gigs, a mentor from her undergraduate years encouraged her to look on a Caltech-operated job website. She saw an opening for a help desk operator at the Spitzer Space Telescope, an infrared telescope that is particularly adept at viewing the formation of young stars—and it only required a bachelor’s degree. “I’d refer the harder questions to the PhDs,” she says. “But by taking that job, I got to go to astronomy talks again … This field of exoplanets had just exploded during the time I’d been away.”

Shields had some success in acting, including a part in a film called Nine Lives, which screened at the Sundance Film Festival. But a big break—and then heartbreak—came after she was cast as the host of the show Wired Science, only to lose the job when the producers decided to change presenters. It was a “devastating moment,” she says.

Soon after, she emailed the astrophysicist and science communications luminary Neil deGrasse Tyson, whom she’d been introduced to over email by an astronomer working with the Spitzer Space Telescope, and relayed what had happened. He replied that he’d seen her in the pilot and told her that “without a PhD you don’t have that street cred if you want to do science television,” she recalls. Meanwhile, she had applied to NASA’s astronaut candidate program but didn’t make it past the first level. (She did, however, get to play an astronaut in a recent Toyota ad.) “There were a lot of these things that seemed to be aligning—that were telling me: Go back and get that PhD,” she says. So she did, earning her doctorate in astronomy and astrobiology in 2014 from the University of Washington.

Astrobiology, Shields explains, is a relatively new field that studies the origin, evolution, and distribution of life in the universe: “It’s about how life got started on Earth.”

Astrobiologists might focus on the habitability of planets, or on methods for exploring life on other planets, or on liquids other than water that could support life. It’s a highly interdisciplinary field. “There are astronomers that are looking for these planets and are using their particular field of expertise to answer that question: Are we alone?” Shields explains. Some of them are “also chemists and biologists and oceanographers and geologists who tackle these questions from their own lens and specific area of expertise,” she says. “That’s why I love it. As an astrobiologist, we don’t have to get 15 PhDs. We get to collaborate with people in different departments who lend their own expertise … on those science questions.”

Shields is trying to answer a question sparked by the night sky—one that’s deeply personal yet universal in both the astronomical and the colloquial sense. “Ever since I was a little girl, I would look up at the sky and wonder what was out there,” she says. “It comes from a sense of wonder for me. I still have that feeling when I look up at the night sky and I see these little pinpoints of light. I wonder: Is there anyone looking back at me? … How far does space go?”

There are, she explains, 100 billion stars in our galaxy, most orbited by at least one planet, and over 100 billion galaxies beyond ours. That’s about 1022 stars in the universe. The likelihood that only Earth was able to produce life “I think is pretty low,” Shields says.

“I’m looking for planetary environments that could be conducive to life beyond Earth,” she says. “And my team does that largely using climate models. These are the same kinds of models that can predict climate and weather on Earth.”

Shields plugs information gathered by observational astronomers into such models, along with different potential combinations of other, unknown variables—like the type of light a planet receives from its host star, the composition of its atmosphere and surface, and certain orbital information. “There’s only so much that you can really tell about a planet from the telescope information that you get,” she explains. “We can explore that parameter space with climate models and say: Okay, if it has this surface composition, this is what the temperature would be like on this planet. If it has this atmospheric composition, this type of orbit, this is what the climate would be like, and this is how habitable it would be across its surface.”

Since the early 1990s, astronomers have discovered 6,000 exoplanets. Shields says those in Earth’s size range—in which she’s most interested—number in the hundreds. A smaller subset of those are orbiting in what’s called the “habitable zone” of their star, creating warm enough conditions to maintain water in liquid form—the key to life. So far, as many as 100 or so planets that fall into that category have been identified, but the James Webb Space Telescope, launched in 2021, could find even more potentially habitable planets by detecting “biosignatures” suggesting a biological presence, such as particular gases in their atmospheres or glints that might be reflections of water on the planetary surface.

Being able to detect more of these sorts of signals, Shields says, is the next “big mission” in astronomy.

Today, in her academic work, her mind hurtles to the farthest reaches of the universe. But in her precious hours outside of academia, she has learned to be still. When her work schedule started to overwhelm her, Shields’s health began to suffer. Then she discovered the practice of yoga nidra—an ancient form of meditation in which practitioners are guided into a deeply restful “yogic sleep.” Shields read the book Do Less: A Revolutionary Approach to Time and Energy Management for Ambitious Women, which claims that 20 or 30 minutes of yoga nidra “feels like three hours of sleep in your body,” she says. “And as the mother of a young child, I was like: Okay, sign me up!”

Last year she trained with Karen Brody, author of Daring to Rest: Reclaim Your Power with Yoga Nidra Rest Meditation, and became a certified facilitator. “It’s been important to me to share it broadly and to really try to do my part to introduce the culture of academia, in particular, to this notion of resting as a daily practice,” she says. Now she’s at work on a book about her attempt to moderate—to resist the temptation to take on too much. She has learned to decline invitations and put firm boundaries between her work and personal life.

Shields has realized that her seemingly disparate interests in astronomy and acting don’t have to be mutually exclusive. Combining them makes her a more effective educator.

On a weekday in August, an ayurvedic soup simmers on her kitchen stove. A music stand occupies the corner of a room where she sometimes picks up her violin and plays fiddle tunes. (Her parents, both professional musicians, derived her name from a chant of vowel sounds they made up.) She mentions the poem “swim | women of color”by Nayyirah Waheed and recites it in a soft, rich voice. Part of it goes: “This structure counts on your inability to say no. mean no. they take no from our first breath. go back and return it to your mouth. your heart. your light.”

“I need to graciously let go or say no—make room for someone else to say yes,” Shields says. “That allows me to have more spaciousness in my schedule, because one thing I’ve discovered is that women of color, as we proceed up the academic ladder, the requests just exponentially increase, and so saying no is not simply an important skill—it’s a survival skill.”

Along the way, Shields has come to realize that her seemingly disparate interests in astronomy and acting don’t have to be mutually exclusive. In fact, combining them—and sharing her passion for both—makes her a more effective educator. Her training as an actor helps her craft lectures that keep students engaged and animates her presentations, including her TED Talk, in a way that resonates with nonscientists.

Shields is also tapping into her love of acting to inspire the next generation of scientists who will help answer astronomy’s big questions. As part of a postdoctoral fellowship through the National Science Foundation, she was asked to design an educational outreach component. “I was like: Is there a scenario in which I could use acting to teach astronomy?” she says. “And I looked it up. There was precedent for that. Astronomy education journals had shown that when you involve girls in creative arts—theater, writing—and you incorporate that into astronomy education, you increase girls’ confidence in both asking and answering questions.”

The finding resonated with her own experience. After all, it was acting—which she turned to when her professor discouraged her from studying astronomy—that gave her the confidence to pursue astronomy again. “I looked at acting as this outlet, this safe space,” she says. “Nobody could tell me that I was wrong as an actor.”

With that in mind, Shields launched Rising Stargirls, which holds workshops using the creative arts to teach astronomy to ­middle-school-aged girls of all backgrounds. She and her colleagues have since published a study showing that girls who attended the program reported being more excited to take science classes and were more likely to believe they could do well in science.

“We want them to know that who they are is inherently pivotal and critical to their study and practice of astronomy,” Shields says. “The sciences are incredibly creative, and they get to bring that creative imagination and creative inspiration they find through the arts into learning about the universe.”

That same exchange has played out in Shields’s life, but it’s only recently that she’s come to see similarities between her roles as an astronomer and an actor. “They’re both about story,” she says.

Actors have to convey the arc or evolution of a story through the lives of their characters. “Stars, ­planets—they have lives, too,” Shields says. “They have births, they have evolution, and they die. It’s my job as a scientist to unveil the story—to discover the story of whether there’s life elsewhere.”

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The AI industry has become adept at measuring itself. Benchmarks improve, model scores rise, and every new release arrives with a list of metrics meant to signal progress. And yet, somewhere between the lab and real life, something keeps slipping.

Which model actually feels better to use?
Which answers would a human trust?
Which system would you put in front of customers, employees, or citizens and feel comfortable standing behind it?

That gap is where LMArena has quietly built its business, and why investors just put $150 million behind it at a $1.7 billion valuation, in a Series A round. The lead investors were Felicis and UC Investments, with participation from major venture firms (Andreessen Horowitz, Kleiner Perkins, Lightspeed, The House Fund, Laude Ventures).

For years, benchmarks were the currency of AI credibility: accuracy scores, reasoning tests and standardized datasets. They worked until they didn’t. As models grew larger and more similar, benchmark improvements became marginal. Worse, models began to optimize for the tests themselves rather than real use cases. Static evaluations struggled to reflect how AI behaves in open-ended, messy human interactions.

At the same time, AI systems moved out of labs and into everyday workflows: drafting emails, writing code, powering customer support, assisting with research and advising professionals. The question shifted from “Can the model do this?” to “Should we trust it when it does?”

That’s a different kind of measurement problem.

LMArena’s answer was simple and radical: stop scoring models in isolation. On its platform, users submit a prompt and receive two anonymized responses. No branding. No model names. Just answers. Then the user picks the better one, or neither.

One vote. One comparison. Repeated millions of times.

The result isn’t a definitive “best,” but a living signal of human preference , how people respond to tone, clarity, verbosity and real-world usefulness. When the prompt isn’t clean or predictable, that signal changes. And it captures something benchmarks often miss.

LMArena isn’t about whether a model produces a factually correct answer. It’s about whether humans prefer it when it does. That distinction is subtle but meaningful in practice. Rankings on the Arena leaderboard are now referenced by developers and labs before releases and product decisions. Major models from OpenAI, Google and Anthropic are regularly evaluated there.

Without traditional marketing, LMArena became a mirror the industry watches.

The $150 million round isn’t just a vote of confidence in LMArena’s product. It signals that AI evaluation itself is becoming infrastructure. As the number of models explodes, enterprise buyers face a new question: not how to get AI, but which AI to trust. Vendor claims and classical benchmarks don’t always translate to real-world reliability. Internal testing is expensive and slow.

A neutral, third-party signal, something that sits between model builders and users  is emerging as a critical layer. That’s where LMArena lives. In September 2025, it launched AI Evaluations, a commercial service that turns its crowdsourced comparison engine into a product enterprises and labs can pay to access. LMArena says this service achieved an annualized run rate of about $30 million within months of launch.

For regulators and policymakers, this kind of human-anchored signal matters too. Oversight frameworks need evidence that reflects real usage, not idealized scenarios.

LMArena’s approach isn’t without debate. Platforms that rely on public voting and crowdsourced signals can reflect the preferences of active users, which may not align with the needs of specific professional domains. In response, competitors like Scale AI’s SEAL Showdown have emerged, aiming to offer more granular, representative model rankings across languages, regions and professional contexts.

Academic research also notes that voting-based leaderboards can be susceptible to manipulation if safeguards aren’t in place, and that such systems may favor superficially appealing responses over technically correct ones if quality control isn’t rigorous.

These debates highlight that no single evaluation method captures every dimension of model behavior, but they also underscore the demand for richer, human-grounded signals beyond traditional benchmarks.

There’s a quiet assumption in AI that trust will emerge naturally as models improve. Better reasoning, so the logic goes, will lead to better outcomes. That framing treats alignment as a technical problem with technical solutions.

LMArena challenges that idea. Trust, in real contexts, is social and contextual. It’s built through experience, not claims. It’s shaped by feedback loops that don’t collapse under scale. By letting users, not companies, decide what works, LMArena introduces friction where the industry often prefers momentum. It slows things down just enough to ask, “Is this actually better, or just newer?”

That’s an uncomfortable question in a market driven by constant release cycles. It’s also why LMArena’s rise feels inevitable.

LMArena doesn’t promise safety. It doesn’t declare models good or bad. It doesn’t replace regulation or responsibility. What it does is simpler and more powerful: it keeps score in public. As AI systems become embedded in everyday decisions, tracking performance over time becomes less optional. Someone has to notice regressions, contextual shifts and usability patterns.

In sports, referees and statisticians fill this role. In markets, auditors and rating agencies do. In AI, we’re still inventing that infrastructure.

LMArena’s funding round suggests investors believe this role won’t stay marginal for long. Because when AI is everywhere, the hardest questions aren’t what it can do. They are who we trust when it does it, and how we know we’re right.

            <div id="article-text">For years, the tech industry equated success with scale. Bigger stages, larger crowds, more logos, more panels, more noise. Five thousand people became ten thousand. Ten thousand became the goal.

Somewhere along the way, that stopped making sense.

Founders and executives didn’t announce a boycott. They simply stopped showing up.

What we see today is not a rejection of events, but a correction in how people who actually run companies choose to spend their time. The shift is subtle, but consistent. Fewer large conferences. More small, curated gatherings. More closed rooms. More dinners. More tables of twelve.

Big tech events struggle because they optimize for visibility, not usefulness. A founder does not need three days of generic content, dozens of panels with no real interaction, or networking sessions where relevance is left to chance.

At scale, everything becomes superficial by default. Conversations shorten. Access disappears. The signal is drowned by the format itself.

What founders look for instead is simple. Context. Trust. Direct access. Conversations without performance. The kind of environment where people can speak honestly, not publicly.

Even when larger conferences still make sense, there is a clear psychological ceiling. Around one thousand participants, in exceptional cases. Beyond that point, quality becomes impossible to control. The event stops being a place where decisions are made and turns into a product designed for mass consumption.

And tech, especially at the founder and executive level, no longer behaves like a mass industry. It behaves like a precision one.

This is why smaller, niche conferences outperform larger ones on every meaningful metric. Ten relevant people in a room will always create more value than a thousand irrelevant ones in a hall.

At a small table, access is natural. No one needs to chase anyone. Trust forms faster. Real conversations happen because there is no audience to impress.

The most important discussions in tech have never happened on stage. They happen before the lights turn on and after the microphones are off.

In parallel with this shift, we have been preparing a private community limited to one thousand founders and executives. It is strictly invite only. Not a platform. Not a public group. Not designed for scale. Designed for relevance. Quality is protected precisely by limitation.

One thing we can say publicly is that TNW will return with an event in 2026. Details, format, and the official launch will be announced soon, but not here. What matters is that this return will not mirror the old model. It will reflect how the industry actually operates today.

Big events are not disappearing. They are simply no longer where important decisions are made.

Across the industry, the shift is already happening. Smaller rooms. Sharper conversations. People who actually need to be there.

            <div id="article-text">Five stars used to mean something. People still read reviews before buying software. They just don’t trust them the way they used to. And no, this isn’t about fake reviews or obvious scams. Those are easy to spot. The real problem is more uncomfortable. The review economy didn’t collapse. It slowly drifted away from its original purpose.

User reviews began as authentic buyer guidance, but they’ve morphed into strategic assets for businesses. Scroll through any app store or e-commerce site: everything is “top-rated” and lavished with praise. If every product gleams with a 4.8/5 rating, those stars start to lose their meaning.

Consumers aren’t fooled, in fact, the share of people who trust online reviews as much as personal recommendations plummeted from nearly 80% in 2020 to just 42% in 2025

We read the glowing comments, but we’ve learned to read between the lines.

TNW City Coworking space - Where your best work happens

A workspace designed for growth, collaboration, and endless networking opportunities in the heart of tech.

It’s not hard to see why trust has eroded. Companies have figured out that great reviews drive sales, so they’ve turned the whole system into a numbers game. High ratings aren’t just social proof now, they’re a growth tactic.  In other words, more stars = more money. So of course businesses are chasing stars like their life depends on it. And in a way, it does.

Behind the scenes, many companies actively engineer their review scores. One common tactic is to time the ask just right. For instance, some businesses send out a Net Promoter Score (NPS) survey to gauge your sentiment “How likely are you to recommend us?”

If you rate them a 9 or 10 (a promoter), you’re immediately nudged to post a public review. If you give a lukewarm or low score, the feedback form quietly thanks you and never mentions writing a review at all.

Only the happiest customers get the gentle push to “Share your experience!” This practice is so widespread it even has a name: “review gating.”

It’s essentially filtering which customers get invited to leave a review based on their initial feedback. Platforms officially frown on it (Google outright forbids “selectively soliciting positive reviews”), but behind closed doors it remains a growth hacker’s favorite trick.

Then there’s the outright incentivization. Perhaps you’ve received an email offering a discount, gift card, or free month of service in exchange for writing a review. It’s framed as a thank-you for your time, of course – “Share your honest feedback and get 10% off your next purchase!” – but the intent is clear.

In an economy of fake praise, even regulators have had to step in to remind everyone that trust isn’t a commodity to be bought. Companies know how to play the game from the other side too: suppressing negativity.

Unhappy customer feedback is quietly diverted to support teams or private channels, where it can be resolved (or simply contained) out of public view. The result is a skewed reality, a glossy wall of five-star testimonials that obscure any hint of dissatisfaction. It’s a great sales tool. It’s terrible for the truth.

Why go to such lengths to manicure the ratings? Because the platforms themselves reward it. The algorithms that sort and highlight products aren’t trying to surface the most truthful review; they’re trying to maximize engagement and conversion.

High ratings and large volumes of reviews make people more likely to click “Buy Now.” That means more conversion for sellers and more commission for the marketplace. In other words, the algorithm is biased toward whatever boosts the platform’s monetization metrics.

A bunch of five-star reviews isn’t just ego bait,  it’s algorithm bait.

Think about it: products with a 4.7-star average and hundreds of reviews tend to appear at the top of search results and recommendation lists. They convert better, so the system pushes them more.

More visibility leads to more sales, which reinforces the high ranking. It’s a feedback loop powered by positive feedback (pun intended). If a vendor can game their way into that virtuous cycle, via perfectly timed prompts or purchased praise, the platform’s code will happily amplify them.

Authenticity doesn’t earn you a top slot; performance does. The incentive is clear: keep it positive, and keep it plentiful. In the review economy, volume and sentiment are king.

Worse, some marketplaces have blurred the line between genuine high-rated listings and paid placement. It’s an open secret that many platforms offer sponsored spots or pay-to-play schemes, think “featured” placements, ads masquerading as top picks, or vendor subscriptions that subtly boost visibility.

Money talks, even if it speaks over the voice of authentic customer feedback. (To be fair, a few holdouts still refuse to monetize their review rankings or sell out their star system, but they’re the exception, not the rule).

Consumers aren’t sitting idly by in this charade. We’ve become savvy at sniffing out over-polished BS. The modern buyer knows how the game is played, and many are adapting their behavior to cope with the broken review system.

First, there’s a migration of trust to private networks and off-platform channels. Instead of relying on the star-average on a marketplace, people turn to friends, colleagues, and niche communities for real advice.

Think about the last time you were unsure about a purchase, maybe you shot a quick message to a group chat, or asked in a private Slack channel, “Hey, has anyone used this product? Is it actually any good?” Personal recommendations feel reliable again, precisely because they’re not part of the public review circus.

Second, savvy consumers cross-check everything. Rather than trusting one site’s reviews, they compare across multiple sources, the product might be 4.8 on the official store, but what’s it rated elsewhere?

Is there a discrepancy between the slick website testimonials and the chatter on Reddit? More often than not, shoppers now triangulate information. In fact, three out of four people use two or more sites when reading reviews, rather than putting all their faith in one platform’s word. We instinctively seek a consensus of truth across the noise.

Finally, many have decided the best judge is themselves. “Try before you buy” has made a comeback as a defense against dubious reviews. Free trials, freemium tiers, generous return policies, consumers leverage them all to test products firsthand.

If a software platform promises the world in its curated testimonials, a savvy buyer will take the 14-day free trial and see if it lives up to the hype. In sectors like enterprise software, where choices are costly and critical, buyers might run a pilot program or proof-of-concept rather than trust glossy case studies. Essentially, experience has become the new review.

All this has serious implications for platforms and software marketplaces. These businesses built their empires on user-generated trust, turning customer opinion into a key part of the shopping experience.

If that trust evaporates, the model cracks. We’re already seeing the early signs: users skipping the review tab, or treating every five-star rating with a healthy dose of skepticism.

If the review economy continues on its current path, platforms risk becoming mere transaction processors rather than trust brokers.

For the marketplaces, this is both a crisis and an opportunity. The crisis is obvious: loss of credibility. If people no longer believe what they read on your platform, they’ll seek validation elsewhere, and your influence over purchase decisions diminishes.

But the opportunity lies in reform. Platforms could double down on authenticity as a feature, verifying purchases, cracking down harder on fraudulent and incentivized reviews, and highlighting more qualitative, nuanced feedback instead of simple star counts.

There’s even a chance to innovate with new trust signals (some are experimenting with things like verified buyer badges, AI analysis for suspicious patterns, or weighted ratings that account for reviewer reputation). The platforms that find ways to genuinely restore faith in their review systems will win back weary consumers. Those that don’t will see their communities drift away, bit by bit.

Importantly, not all platforms have given in to the dark side. A handful still refuse pay-for-play tactics, no paid reviews, no under-the-table boosting of rankings for advertisers.

These holdouts demonstrate that integrity in reviews is possible, even if it means slower growth in the short term.

In the end, the broken review economy is forcing a rebalance of how we decide what to trust. Buyers are adapting, finding new ways to cut through the noise. And the platforms that once thrived on being the ultimate source of truth in purchasing may have to rethink their approach if they want to stay relevant.

Trust, once lost, is hard to regain. The five-star system doesn’t shine as bright as it used to; perhaps it’s time for the next evolution in how we share and earn trust online.

            <div id="article-text">2025 was the year technology stopped being tomorrow’s promise and became today’s anchor. What began as a surge in generative AI and platform innovation two years prior crystallized this year into concrete shifts in how people work, governing bodies legislate, and markets invest. Across continents and industries, the arc of technology bent toward practical impact, regulatory reality, and economic weight!

At the heart of the year’s story was artificial intelligence’s jump from novelty to infrastructure. LLMs and multimodal models moved beyond demos into everyday workflows, influencing how documents are written, campaigns are conceived, products designed, and code generated.

Enterprises that once hesitated began deploying AI tools at scale, with early adopters reporting measurable productivity gains by integrating copilots into core processes, a trend visible in surveys showing widespread adoption among software professionals.

This editorial isn’t a chronicle of every press release.

It’s a reflection on how 2025, at the crossroads of technology, governance, and economic strategy, brought about a series of inflection points that will shape the next era of creation, competition, and control.

TNW City Coworking space - Where your best work happens

A workspace designed for growth, collaboration, and endless networking opportunities in the heart of tech.

OpenAI’s release of GPT-5 in August pushed the boundaries of what AI could do, delivering notable gains in coding, math, and multimodal understanding. But unlike the jaw-dropping debut of ChatGPT a couple years prior, this new generation of foundation models arrived to a more measured reception.

Tech leaders and investors had begun asking harder questions: beyond impressive demos, could these models drive real products and revenue?

Google’s answer was Gemini 3, launched in November as its “most intelligent model” and immediately woven into Google’s flagship product, Search. For the first time, an AI model upgrade wasn’t just about boastful leaderboard scores, it was about transforming user experience.

Typing a query into Google now often meant receiving an AI-generated synthesis instead of the familiar list of links, a sea change in how information is delivered. Google even unveiled a Gemini “agent” that could execute multi-step tasks like booking travel or organizing email, hinting at a future where AI acts more like a digital butler than a chatbox.

Anthropic’s Claude 4 model, for instance, gained a strong following among developers by expanding how much it could handle at once, processing entire codebases with tens of thousands of lines, rather than by producing viral one-liners.

AI grew up in 2025: it was still improving at breakneck speed, but it also had to earn its keep in real products and justify the billion-dollar bets fueling its rise.

Driving this AI explosion was a parallel leap in hardware. The hunger for AI computers in 2025 was insatiable, and chipmakers raced to deliver.

NVIDIA, whose GPUs had become the era’s essential infrastructure, rolled out its new Blackwell architecture with chips like the B200 that boasted up to 3× the training speed of its predecessor. Cloud data centers around the world scrambled to deploy these to keep up with demand from model training and inference.

Rival chipmakers weren’t idle either: AMD and a cadre of startups pushed innovative AI accelerators, while even Intel signaled ambitions to catch up, reportedly exploring an acquisition of AI chip designer SambaNova.

Perhaps most tellingly, tech giants themselves started designing silicon tailored for AI workloads, recognizing that owning the chip means owning the future of computing.

Beyond AI chips, consumer hardware saw its own milestones. After years of anticipation, augmented reality glasses and mixed-reality headsets finally had their moment, sort of.

Apple’s Vision Pro headset, unveiled in late 2023, reached select markets in 2024; by 2025 developers were crafting the first wave of immersive apps. However, mass adoption lagged due to the device’s sky-high price and bulky format.

Competitors like Meta’s Quest line offered cheaper VR headsets and modest improvements, but the “metaverse” hype of yesteryear largely fizzled out, users and investors had shifted their excitement to generative AI and tangible productivity tools.

Smartphones and laptops in 2025 continued incremental improvements (faster Apple M3/M4 chips, foldable screens becoming more common), yet it was clear the next paradigm shift in personal tech was still on the horizon.

Even so, one hardware frontier made concrete progress: quantum computing. Industry leaders like IBM and Google demonstrated prototype systems with ever-larger qubit counts and made strides in error correction, inching closer to viable quantum machines.

These advances, while esoteric to the public, underscored a broader theme, from AI accelerators to quantum chips, the machinery under the hood of tech was evolving rapidly to enable the software of tomorrow.

If 2025 proved anything, it’s that technology no longer operates above the law. This was the year regulators moved from intent to enforcement, with Europe leading the charge.

After years of debate, the EU’s Artificial Intelligence Act came into force, becoming the world’s first complex AI law. From February, certain “unacceptable risk” uses, such as social scoring and real-time biometric surveillance, were banned outright.

By August, transparency rules followed, forcing companies to label AI-generated content and comply with new obligations for general-purpose models. The signal was unmistakable: in Europe, the era of unchecked AI was over.

Companies now face audits, penalties, and real consequences if their systems cross legal or ethical lines, a regulatory moment European officials openly compared to GDPR’s impact on data privacy.

The pressure didn’t stop with AI. In 2025, regulators also went after the gatekeepers. The EU’s Digital Markets Act forced long-resistant changes from Big Tech, most notably when Apple opened the iPhone to third-party app stores and sideloading in Europe, dismantling a 15-year walled garden.

At the same time, enforcement of the Digital Services Act intensified. Platforms were scrutinized for how they handle disinformation, with companies like X warned or penalized during periods of geopolitical tension. In response, social networks expanded moderation teams, adjusted algorithms, and exposed more of their inner workings to researchers.

The US issued an AI executive order and signaled tougher enforcement through agencies like the FTC, while states stepped in, including New York’s law requiring mental-health warnings on addictive social features.

In China, new draft rules targeted AI systems designed for human-like interaction, tightening licensing and ideological oversight. By the end of the year, the freewheeling phase of tech disruption had given way to something more restrained. The question was no longer whether regulation would catch up, but how deeply it would reshape innovation itself.

The platform shake-up that began in 2023 gathered real momentum in 2025, as both companies and users adjusted to a post-pandemic, AI-saturated reality.

Nowhere was this clearer than in social media. Elon Musk’s X, which entered the decade with noise and bravado, found itself on the defensive. Meta’s Threads, initially dismissed after an early spike, steadily closed the gap, nearing parity with X in daily mobile users by mid-year.

X’s audience shrank as policy whiplash and leadership churn eroded confidence, and while its remaining users were still deeply engaged, the era of unquestioned Twitter dominance was over. Disenchanted users scattered across a fragmented landscape, from Meta’s polished Threads to decentralized alternatives like Bluesky and Mastodon, breaking the old Facebook–Instagram–Twitter equilibrium.

The recalibration extended well beyond social feeds.

Major platforms retooled around changing habits: Google reshaped Search around generative answers to fend off AI assistants and algorithmic discovery, while Microsoft pushed its Copilot deeper into Windows, Office, and Bing, betting on “AI inside” as a platform reset.

Everyday behavior shifted too. Smarter voice and chat assistants returned to daily use, handling emails, refunds, and scheduling with little friction. At the same time, screen fatigue set in. Digital-detox travel gained traction, and younger users gravitated toward apps that promised less algorithmic pressure and more human curation. Even streaming came full circle.

After years of fragmentation, providers began rebundling services, offering combined video, music, and gaming packages that looked suspiciously like cable TV reborn, a reminder that while technology moves forward, user preferences often move in cycles.

Amid the gains and momentum, 2025 also became a year of reckoning. As AI systems spread, society began grappling with their cultural and ethical cost. Creators who once marveled at generative tools started pushing back, arguing that their work had been absorbed without consent or compensation.

A wave of lawsuits moved through US courts, with authors accusing companies like OpenAI, Meta, and Google of scraping books and articles to train models. By year’s end, the message was unmistakable: if AI is built on human creativity, many believe its rewards can no longer flow in one direction alone.

Public trust in technology was also tested by a rise in malicious uses and misuses. In the financial domain, sophisticated deepfake scams caused real damage. The frequency of such incidents spiked sharply; cybersecurity firms reported a 3000% increase in deepfake-related fraud over two years, and authorities scrambled to educate businesses on new verification practices.

Misinformation continued to be a menace: during elections and conflicts, AI-generated fake images and videos spread on social media, forcing newsrooms to set up rapid-response fact-checking teams.

Encouragingly, 2025 also saw growth in countermeasures, from better deepfake detection algorithms to nascent standards for cryptographic content authentication (the Coalition for Content Provenance, including major publishers and tech platforms, expanded efforts to watermark authentic media).

Still, the information ecosystem remained fraught, as even savvy citizens found it ever harder to tell the truth from fabrication online.

And then there’s the human element: how all this tech is affecting everyday lives and livelihoods. Workplace AI adoption soared this year; tools like Microsoft 365 Copilot and a host of AI assistants became common on office desktops. Studies showed productivity boosts but also raised concerns about workers becoming overly reliant on AI suggestions.

Meanwhile, fears of automation resurfaced in certain sectors, for example, as chatbots took over more customer service and code-generation tools improved, professionals in call centers and junior programming positions wondered about long-term job security.

These anxieties fueled calls for new approaches to education and training, so that the workforce of 2030 will be prepared for more creative, complex tasks that AI can’t easily handle.

Lovable (Stockholm, Sweden) came as one of the most remarkable AI software stories of the year, for me. What began as an open-source project evolved into a commercial platform that lets users build fully functional websites and apps using plain-language prompts, no traditional coding required.

This approach, known in the industry as “vibe coding,” turns ideas into production-ready software simply by describing what you want in natural language.

Lovable’s growth in 2025 was extraordinary by any measure. Eight months after its launch, the company hit over $100 million in annual recurring revenue and raised a $200 million Series A at a roughly $1.8 billion valuation, making it one of Europe’s fastest-growing software startups ever.

By year’s end, Lovable had secured $330 million in Series B funding at about a $6.6 billion valuation, and was rapidly scaling globally.

What makes Lovable meaningful beyond the numbers is what it represents: a shift in how software is built. It demonstrated that AI can democratize development, giving power to non-technical founders, creators, and teams to go from concept to product without traditional engineering barriers.

In an industry long centered on specialized skills and team structures, Lovable’s rise suggested a future where natural language becomes the primary interface to software creation.

On a more hopeful note, 2025 showed signs of a maturing tech culture. Ethical design moved from talking point to practice. Major platforms began experimenting with limits, turning off infinite scroll for teens, adding prompts that nudged users to pause, and treating “time well spent” as a real metric rather than a slogan.

In AI, transparency gained ground. Under pressure from regulators and researchers, companies like OpenAI and Google disclosed more about how their models are trained and where they fall short.

Researchers formed new alliances to share safety techniques, and a second global AI Safety Summit brought dozens of countries together around questions of alignment and control.

None of it amounted to binding rules, but it marked a shift in tone: even the architects of powerful systems openly acknowledged the need for restraint.

Taken together, these moments made 2025 a turning point. For years, technology had surged ahead of the institutions meant to guide it. This year, that gap began to close.

The breakthroughs were real and transformative, but so were the responses to them: laws passed, norms reset, alliances formed. If 2024 was the year the world grasped the power of generative AI, 2025 was the year it began deciding how that power should be used.

The story of technology is no longer just about what can be built, but about how it fits into the lives it shapes, and who gets to decide that fit.

            <div id="article-text">My name is Alexandru Stan, and this article continues the dialogue I began following the acquisition of TNW.

Following the recent transaction, TNW Spaces remains with the Financial Times, while we continue the mission of the website, the events, and the global community.

We already have a dedicated team at tekpon operating the platform, events, and community initiatives. Our objective is to expand and strengthen the team as TNW accelerates its next chapter.

TNW is already a global media platform with millions of readers. We’re not starting over. We are building forward.

TNW City Coworking space - Where your best work happens

A workspace designed for growth, collaboration, and endless networking opportunities in the heart of tech.

Technology is entering a decisive stage: AI is reshaping workflows, distribution is shifting, capital is becoming more selective, and founders are expected to demonstrate value rather than potential.

The world doesn’t need more noise.
It needs clarity, execution, and access to trustworthy knowledge and people.

TNW will serve that need through editorial independence, real expertise, and community-built intelligence.

Success for TNW looks like this: more accurate understanding, faster access to verified knowledge, and direct pathways from insight to action.

I’ve been an entrepreneur since 2007, building in B2B SaaS, marketplaces, and scalable systems. I believe deeply in servant leadership. Without people, I am zero.

I lead two private networks grounded in practice rather than theory:

These groups ensure TNW remains rooted in lived experience, informed by operators, not commentators.

Our mission is to build the most trusted European tech media platform with global reach, focused on practical innovation, responsible scaling, and transparency.

We will continue to host events across Europe’s major capitals including Paris, London, Berlin, Amsterdam, and Monaco.

These will not be festivals. We are introducing a concept validated through tekpon events: curated gatherings built for meaningful relationships, deep content, and tangible business outcomes.

In 2026, we return to Amsterdam for a special edition centered on AI among other fields. We will explore technologies and strategies shaping the future of work and business:

The editorial focus remains European, while the audience is global.

AI is not a threat to publishing. It is the infrastructure of the next generation of content and knowledge.

At TNW, we will use AI to accelerate research, enable personalized intelligence, reduce noise and bias, and amplify high-quality human expertise. Technology assists. Human judgment remains central.

Because this moment in Europe matters.
Because founders here are ready to scale responsibly.
Because independent media with integrity is rare.
Because innovation deserves a platform built around people, not hype.

TNW will continue its legacy with a renewed emphasis on contribution, execution, and community built through trust.

If you are building, scaling, or researching the next wave of technology, I invite you to engage with us, contribute insights, and participate in shaping the conversation.

The next era begins now. Let’s shape it together.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Most engineering leaders cannot answer the one question their CFO is about to ask: “Can you prove this AI spend is changing outcomes, not just activity?”

Every December, roadmaps get locked, budgets get approved, and board decks are polished until everything looks precise and under control. Underneath, many CTOs and VPs are still working with partial visibility. They have a feel for their teams, but not a reliable view of how work moves through the system, how AI is really changing delivery, or where time and money actually go.

For a while, that was survivable. Experience, pattern recognition, and cheap capital covered the gaps. You could hire around bottlenecks, overstaff critical teams, or quietly pivot away from the messiest parts of the system. Then AI showed up and became the perfect distraction. Pilots, PoCs, Copilot seats, and “AI initiatives” created visible activity and bought time.

In 2026, that grace period ends. Boards and CFOs are shifting from “show me you are experimenting” to “show me measurable impact, this year.” Not because they stopped believing in AI, but because the market no longer rewards vague promises. Every AI dollar will need a traceable path to productivity, quality, or customer value.

If you run engineering, you probably recognise this scene. You present a slide with AI highlights. Adoption is up. Developers say they like the tools. You share a few anecdotes about faster coding and smoother reviews. Then the CFO asks a simple question: “Exactly how is this budget changing output and outcomes?”

TNW City Coworking space - Where your best work happens

A workspace designed for growth, collaboration, and endless networking opportunities in the heart of tech.

What is almost always missing is a clear breakdown of:

So the conversation slips back to learning curves, compounding benefits, and talent attraction. All true, but too soft for a tough budget review. That will not be enough.

AI vendors love task-level numbers. A coding task completed 55 percent faster looks impressive on a slide. But once you zoom out to teams and systems, the picture changes.

Large datasets across thousands of developers show a consistent pattern:

The problem is not the tools. It is the lack of a system for where the “extra” capacity goes.

Most organisations still frame AI productivity in terms of speed: more story points, more tickets, higher deployment frequency. That misses the bigger question:

How much of our engineering capacity goes to net new value versus maintenance, incidents, and rework, and is AI improving that mix?

High-level benchmarks are blunt but helpful. On average, about 45 percent of developer time is spent on maintenance, minor enhancements, and bug fixes rather than on genuinely new, customer-facing work. If AI helps you produce more code inside an unchanged system, you risk:

That is how you end up with impressive local metrics and a leadership team that still feels like engineering is slowing down.

If you want to walk into a 2026 budget conversation with objective evidence, you need to be deliberate about how AI-driven time savings are used. Two moves matter.

AI is already good at boilerplate, tests, documentation, and simple refactors. The trap is treating the saved time as unstructured “extra” capacity that disappears into the noise. Instead:

When teams systematically reduce technical debt and improve tests around critical flows, they cut future incidents and rework. Over a year, that frees more capacity for new work than shaving a few minutes off each ticket ever will.

2. Point AI at the ugly, high-friction work that commonly blows up roadmaps

The biggest productivity wins are not in everyday code generation. They are in:

These activities steal weeks or months of capacity and stall strategic initiatives. Using AI to understand legacy code faster, propose refactoring plans, generate migration scaffolding, and highlight recurring failure patterns can dramatically compress timelines for this work.

In parallel, there is real leverage upstream in the problem space. Teams that reach higher levels of AI adoption report better gains when they:

That reduces wasted builds and focuses effort on changes customers actually care about. The most significant gains do not come from replacing human creativity, but from amplifying it and aiming it at better-defined problems.

DORA metrics are not the enemy. Deployment frequency, lead time, MTTR, and change failure rate remain among the best signals we have for delivery performance. The risk is mistaking them for the whole picture.

Leading organisations are already expanding their scorecard to include:

In 2026, the question in the boardroom will shift from “Are we elite on DORA?” to “How much of our capacity is going into things customers notice, and is AI improving that mix or not?” To answer that cleanly, DORA is necessary but not sufficient. You need a way to connect AI usage, workflow, quality, and business outcomes across the system.

This is where engineering intelligence platforms move from a nice-to-have to mandatory. The organisations that win in 2026 will not do it with one more AI tool or one more disconnected dashboard. They will do it by pulling together data they already have but rarely use in one coherent view:

From there, leaders can answer the questions that actually matter:

Instead of defending AI spend with anecdotes, you walk in with:

That is the difference between “we believe in AI” and “here is how AI changed our delivery engine in measurable ways.”

To be ready for the more complex questions coming next year, use this planning cycle to do four things.

Do this, and you will not just have “AI activity” to show in 2026. You will have a credible, data-backed story from AI spend to business outcomes.

The leaders who thrive next year will not be the ones with the flashiest AI demos or the loudest “AI strategy” slide. They will be the ones who:

Engineering intelligence platforms is a key part of that shift. They give you the complex data to show where time and money go, how AI is really changing delivery, and whether your current pace is sustainable. The shift to data-backed engineering leadership is happening either way.

The gap in 2026 will be between teams still guessing and teams that can prove, in detail, how their engineering organisation works.
