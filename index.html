            <h2>Bose open-sources its SoundTouch home theater smart speakers ahead of end-of-life</h2>
            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-01-07</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2026/01/bose-open-sources-its-soundtouch-home-theater-smart-speakers-ahead-of-eol/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Bose released the Application Programming Interface (API) documentation for its SoundTouch speakers today, putting a silver lining around the impending end-of-life (EoL) of the expensive home theater devices.

In October, Bose announced that its SoundTouch Wi-Fi speakers and soundbars would become dumb speakers on February 18. At the time, Bose said that the speakers would only work if a device was connected via AUX, HDMI, or Bluetooth (which has higher latency than Wi-Fi).

After that date, the speakers would stop receiving security and software updates and lose cloud connectivity and their companion app, the Framingham, Massachusetts-based company said. Without the app, users would no longer be able to integrate the device with music services, such as Spotify, have multiple SoundTouch devices play the same audio simultaneously, or use or edit saved presets.

The announcement frustrated some of Bose’s long-time customers, some of whom own multiple SoundTouch devices that still function properly. Many questioned companies’ increasingly common practice of bricking expensive products to focus on new devices or to minimize costs, or because they’ve gone through acquisitions or bankruptcy. SoundTouch speakers released in 2013 and 2015 with prices ranging from $399 to $1,500.

Today, Bose had better news. In an email to customers, Bose announced that AirPlay and Spotify Connect will still work with SoundTouch speakers after EoL, expanding the wireless capabilities that people will still be able to access.

Additionally, SoundTouch devices that support AirPlay 2 can play the same audio simultaneously.

The SoundTouch app will also live on, albeit stripped of some functionality.

“On May 6, 2026, the app will update to a version that supports the functions that can operate locally without the cloud. No action will be required on your part. Opening the app will apply the update automatically,” Bose said.

Bose also provided instructions for a workaround for saving presets that uses the favorites options in music service apps.

In recent years, especially, we’ve seen numerous companies that make smart devices abandon their products, leaving users with few options. Often, when a company announces that it will brick one of its smart devices, there’s a call for the company to open-source the gadget’s API and firmware so that already-purchased devices don’t become e-waste and so people can continue using them or even add functionality to the device.

Companies are often reluctant to do this, however, with a key concern being that the device—and therefore the company that originally made it—could become associated with a controversial hack.

Bose doesn’t seem worried about that, though, as today it emailed customers SoundTouch’s API documentation [PDF] “so that independent developers can create their own SoundTouch-compatible tools and features.”

There are SoundTouch owners who will remain inconvenienced when Bose discontinues the devices in May. Despite the changes announced today, Bose is still killing some popular functionality on speakers that would work perfectly fine otherwise.

Ideally, Bose would support its products for as long as they are functioning. But for many smart home companies, that’s not feasible or desirable because such ongoing support can take resources away from other projects with larger user bases or can otherwise detract from growing or sustaining business by encouraging fewer purchases. It can also be complex and costly to get older devices to work with newer software and other technologies.

Truthfully, companies like Bose will continue to seek ways to make more money and to sell more devices. If such companies refuse to stop bricking their customers’ gadgets before we’re ready, the steps that Bose is taking with SoundTouch should be more common.

Open-sourcing devices so that people who have already invested in them can continue enjoying them and striving to maintain as much device functionality as possible is the least that smart device makers can do before discontinuing customers’ beloved devices.</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">If you’re a Mac user with Logitech accessories and you’ve noticed that your settings and customizations seem to have gone away this week, you’re not alone.

The company’s Logi Options+ and G Hub apps for macOS abruptly stopped functioning on Monday, refusing to launch and reverting all accessories’ settings to their built-in defaults.

The culprit, according to both a Logitech support page and Reddit posts from Logitech Head of Global Marketing Joe Santucci, was a security certificate that was inadvertently allowed to expire, rendering both apps non-functional.

“The certificate that expired is used to secure inter-process communications and the expiration results in the software not being able to start successfully,” wrote Santucci in one post. “We dropped the ball here,” he said in another post. “This is an inexcusable mistake. We’re extremely sorry for the inconvenience caused.”

Logitech is already offering patches for both apps that include an updated certificate. But unfortunately for users, one of the features broken by the expired certificate is the app’s built-in updater, meaning that there’s no automated way for Logitech to fix this problem. Anyone who wants their apps to work and their customizations to return will need to manually grab the patch (or updated versions of the apps, which Logitech says it is also working on). If you use both apps, each will need to be patched separately.

Users who install the app update should find that their settings and customizations are as they were before the outage, at least as long as they didn’t uninstall the app first while they were trying to get it to work.

“The patch will not affect the settings, but some users, prior to installing the patch, as part of troubleshooting, often uninstall/reinstall the app trying to get it to work and lose settings,” reads Logitech’s FAQ page about the issue. “So we recommend only using the patch installer.”

The patch works with the last four versions of macOS: macOS 13 Ventura, macOS 14 Sonoma, macOS 15 Sequoia, and macOS 26 Tahoe. Fixes for older macOS versions “will be made available at a later time.” (But if you’re still running a macOS version that old and you can update to macOS 14, 15, or 26, you should do it—those are the only versions Apple is currently supporting with security and Safari updates.)</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">SteamOS’s slow march across the Windows-dominated PC gaming landscape is continuing to creep along. At CES this week, Lenovo announced it will launch a version of last year’s high-priced, high-powered Legion Go 2 handheld with Valve’s gaming-focused, Linux-based OS pre-installed starting in June. And there are some intriguing signs from Valve that SteamOS could come to non-AMD devices in the not-too-distant future as well.

A new SteamOS-powered Legion Go 2 isn’t exactly shocking news given how things have been going in the world of PC gaming handhelds. Lenovo became the first non-Valve hardware maker to embrace the Windows alternative when it announced a SteamOS-compatible version of the lower-end Legion Go S almost exactly a year ago. When that version hit the market last spring, Ars testing found it actually performed better than the Windows-based version of the same hardware on many popular games.

Valve has also been working behind the scenes to expand SteamOS’s footprint beyond its own hardware. After rolling out the SteamOS Compatible software label last May, SteamOS version 3.7 offered support for manual installation on AMD-powered handhelds like the ROG Ally and the original Legion Go.

Adding the upgraded Legion Go 2 to that list will give those preferring SteamOS an option to buy in to beefier, pre-built handheld hardware without crafting their own Steam Machine from component parts. Like its Windows-based cousin, the new Legion Go 2 will come equipped with a Ryzen Z2 Extreme processor (like the ROG Ally X), 32GB of LPDDR5X memory, and an 8.8-inch 1920×1200 OLED screen. It has a hefty starting price of $1,199.

Even as SteamOS slowly spreads across the AMD-powered hardware landscape, the OS continues to be limited by a lack of compatibility with the wide world of Arm devices. That could change in the near future, though, as Valve’s upcoming Steam Frame VR headset will sport a new version of SteamOS designed specifically for the headset’s Arm-based hardware.

Over time, Valve sees that kind of support expanding to other Arm-based devices, too. “This is already fully open source, so you could download it and run SteamOS, now that we will be releasing SteamOS for Arm, you could have gaming on any Arm device,” Valve Engineer Jeremy Selan told PC Gamer in November. “This is the first one. We’re very excited about it.”

It’s an especially exciting prospect when you consider the wide range of Arm-based Android gaming handhelds that currently exist across the price and performance spectrum. While emulators like Fex can technically let players access Steam games on those kinds of handhelds, official Arm support for SteamOS could lead to a veritable Cambrain explosion of hardware options with native SteamOS support.

Valve seems aware of this potential, too. “There’s a lot of price points and power consumption points where Arm-based chipsets are doing a better job of serving the market,” Valve’s Pierre-Louis Griffais told The Verge last month. “When you get into lower power, anything lower than Steam Deck, I think you’ll find that there’s an Arm chip that maybe is competitive with x86 offerings in that segment. We’re pretty excited to be able to expand PC gaming to include all those options instead of being arbitrarily restricted to a subset of the market.”

That’s great news for fans of PC-based gaming handhelds, just as the announcement of Valve’s Steam Machine will provide a convenient option for SteamOS access on the living room TV. For desktop PC gamers, though, rigs sporting Nvidia GPUs might remain the final frontier for SteamOS in the foreseeable future. “With Nvidia, the integration of open-source drivers is still quite nascent,” Griffais told Frandroid about a year ago. “There’s still a lot of work to be done on that front… So it’s a bit complicated to say that we’re going to release this version when most people wouldn’t have a good experience.”</div>

            <h2>Japanese nuclear plant operator fabricated seismic risk data</h2>
            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-01-07</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2026/01/japanese-nuclear-plant-operator-fabricated-seismic-risk-data/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">On Wednesday, Japan’s Nuclear Regulation Authority announced that it is halting the relicensing process for two reactors at the Hamaoka plant after revelations that the operator fabricated seismic hazard data. Japan has been slowly reactivating its extensive nuclear power plant collection after it was shut down following the Fukushima Daiichi disaster. The latest scandal is especially shocking, given that the Hamaoka plant is located on the coast near an active subduction fault—just as Fukushima Daiichi is.

The Nuclear Regulation Authority was reportedly alerted by a whistleblower in February of last year, but the issue became public this week when the regulators halted an evaluation process that could have led to a reactor restart at Hamaoka. This prompted the company that operates the plants, the Chubu Electric Power Co., to issue a press release describing in detail how the company manipulated the seismic safety data.

Based on an English translation, it appears that seismic risks were evaluated at least in part by scaling up the ground motion using data from smaller earthquakes. This is an inexact process, so the standard approach is to create a group of 20 different upscaled earthquake motions and find the one that best represents the average among the 20.

The company now acknowledges that since 2018, its staff has been generating large collections of upscaled earthquake scenarios, choosing one from among them, and then selecting another 19 so the average would make that event appear representative. The company does not mention how this process affected risk analysis, but it’s probably safe to assume that it was chosen specifically to make any risks seem more tolerable.

Given Japan’s slow and hesitant process of reactivating its fleet of nuclear plants, the decision to fudge safety evaluations is striking. But it’s especially notable given the location of the Hamaoka plant: directly on the east coast of Japan. That places it closer to the subduction zone off the coast that generates the country’s occasionally catastrophic earthquakes. It also places the site at risk of the sort of tsunami that caused the Fukushima plant to melt down. Although the falsified data doesn’t involve tsunami risks, you might expect that the company would be especially cautious about getting its safety data right.

In response to the revelation, the Chubu Electric Power Co. has appointed a committee of external lawyers to fully detail what was done and how it happened. And, as mentioned above, the country’s nuclear watchdog agency has terminated the safety evaluation that would need to be completed before the plant could be brought back into service. At this point, it’s not clear when this process might be restarted, much less when it might result in a restart of the reactor.

Its timing is also less than ideal for the Nuclear Regulation Authority, which is trying to regain public trust after accusations of regulatory capture that allowed major safety risks to go unrecognized. The day prior, Bloomberg reported that a staff member at the Nuclear Regulation Authority lost a phone carrying classified information while traveling through China.</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The electric vehicle transition might not be moving ahead with the same gusto it showed in the early 2020s, but it’s still happening. According to Deloitte’s 2026 Global Automotive Consumer Study, 7 percent of US car buyers want an electric vehicle for their next car. While that might sound rather meager, it’s a 40 percent increase from 2025’s survey, which found just 5 percent of car buyers wanted an EV.

Plain old internal combustion remains Americans’ first choice, with 61 percent telling the survey that’s how their next ride will be powered. Twenty-one percent want a hybrid, up from 20 percent last year. Just 5 percent indicated a desire for a plug-in hybrid (down from 6 percent last year), with the remaining confused souls either unsure of what to buy next (4 percent) or some other option, presumably hydrogen (1 percent).

The high demand for internal combustion engines makes the US an outlier among large car-buying markets. Fewer than half of German car buyers want another gas-powered vehicle, and that number falls to just 41 percent in China, Japan, and South Korea. But those consumers aren’t all fleeing internal combustion for battery EVs. Well, they mostly are in China, where EV demand is now 20 percent. But in Japan, only 5 percent of consumers want a battery EV, versus 37 percent indicating their next car would be a hybrid.

Deloitte conducted the survey between October and November 2025, by which time the current US government’s anti-EV policies would have come into effect. These include cancelling the clean vehicle tax credit, rolling back fuel efficiency standards, and declining to prosecute automakers that exceed existing efficiency regulations, as well as the uncertainty of capricious import tariffs. Many automakers have spent the last several years building up capacity to manufacture EVs in North America for the US market, but the return on those investments is unlikely be soon.

Americans also lag behind many of their international peers when it comes to that most important condition for buying an EV or plug-in hybrid: having somewhere to plug it in at night. Fifty-three percent of US respondents said they do not have a way to charge at home. By contrast, that number was 20 percent in Germany and just six percent in China. Only Japan—where plug-ins and EVs are even less popular than in the US—had a higher rate of no charger access at home (75 percent).

While reliable charging at one’s workplace—emphasis on reliable—can make up for not being able to charge at home, 77 percent of US car buyers said they would prefer to charge at home (with just 13 percent indicating they would prefer charging at work).

For people who haven’t yet decided to switch, an underappreciated fact is just how much more efficient an electric powertrain is compared to one that burns liquid petroleum. Ford’s experiment putting an electric powertrain into its best-selling F-150 pickup truck might have turned sour, but consider the following: The V6 truck needs more than three times as much energy to travel 300 miles as the one you plug into a wall, when you consider a gallon of gasoline contains 33.7 kWh of energy.

Among the EV-convinced, this is presumably old news. More than half—52 percent of US survey respondents—said lower fuel costs were a reason for choosing an EV, beating out concern for the environment, which ranked second at 38 percent. And between $20,000 and $49,999 appears to be the pricing sweet spot, with 24 percent looking for something in the $20,000–$34,999 band (cars like the new Nissan Leaf or the soon-reborn Chevrolet Bolt) and another 24 percent looking in the $35,000–$49,999 band, which has plenty of EVs to choose from, including Mercedes-Benz’s efficient new CLA.

Just 7 percent of those EV buyers are looking to spend more than $75,000 on their electric car, but luxury EVs abound at this price point.

Meanwhile, range and charging times remain the foremost concerns among car buyers when discussing EVs, along with the cost premium. Some other fears are ill-founded, however. Thirty-eight percent said they were concerned about the cost of eventually replacing an EV’s battery. But EV batteries are proving more durable on the road than many early adopters once believed. There’s little evidence that EVs will require costly battery replacements with any more frequency than older cars require new engines, a concern that is rarely mentioned when someone wants to buy a gas-powered machine.

One of the biggest shifts in car design and manufacturing over the past few years has been the advent of the software-defined vehicle. Until now, pretty much every electronic function in a car, from an electric window to the antilock brakes, needed its own electronic control unit. Some cars can have up to two hundred discrete ECUs, some with software dating back years.

A software-defined vehicle (or SDV) goes for a clean-sheet approach. Instead of dozens and dozens of discrete black boxes, a handful of powerful computers replaces them. One usually controls the vehicle dynamics and powertrain, a second will handle driver assists and safety tech, a third is in charge of infotainment, and a fourth handles heating, cooling, and other in-car comfort. All-new code means no more legacy cruft, and the modern electronic architecture allows for regular over-the-air bug fixes and updates that add new functionality.

Anecdotally, I’ve found that the Ars Technica audience has very little interest in reading about this seismic shift, and you’re not alone. Only 41 percent of US car buyers think SDVs are useful, and one in three says they have no use for one. The concept is even less popular in the UK, Germany, and Japan, but it has far more acceptance in China, South Korea, and Southeast Asia.

Those attitudes correlate with willingness to pay extra for OTA updates. Only 7 percent of Chinese customers said they were unwilling to pay for OTA updates, and half said a car that can be updated would be worth a 6–10 percent price premium compared to a car that can’t. In the US, 39 percent said they would not pay more for a car with OTA functionality.

There’s also much less interest in using one’s car as a digital platform for other “integrated” services. More than half (53 percent) of US car buyers have no interest in such a thing, with another 19 percent indicating neutrality on the topic. Only one in five Americans said their car was a more important digital platform than their smartphone, compared to 56 percent of Chinese car buyers. Given this reality, how much longer will automakers like Rivian and General Motors keep Apple CarPlay out of their cockpits? Neither has significant export markets for its EVs, yet both believe EV drivers will eschew their smartphones over an in-vehicle solution, presumably with some kind of recurring revenue involved.</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Anyone paying attention to battery research sees sulfur come up frequently. That’s mostly because sulfur is a great storage material for lithium, and it could lead to lithium batteries with impressive power densities. But sulfur can participate in a wide range of chemical reactions, which has made it difficult to prevent lithium-sulfur batteries from decaying rapidly as the sulfur forms all sorts of unwanted materials. As a result, despite decades of research, very few lithium-sulfur batteries have made it to market.

But a team of Chinese researchers has managed to turn sulfur’s complex chemistry into a strength, making it the primary electron donor in a sodium-sulfur battery that also relies on chlorine for its chemistry. The result, at least in the lab, is an impressive energy per weight with extremely inexpensive materials.

Sulfur sits immediately below oxygen on the periodic table, so you might think its chemistry would look similar. But that’s not the case. Like oxygen, it can participate in covalent bonding in biological chemistry, including in two essential amino acids. Also, like oxygen, it can accept electrons from metals, as seen in some atomically thin materials that have been studied. But it’s also willing to give electrons up, forming chemical compounds with things like chlorine and oxygen.

It’s that last feature the researchers behind the new paper are most interested in. Pure sulfur forms an eight-atom complex that can give up 32 total electrons under the right conditions. The trick was finding the right conditions.

The system had a cathode of pure sulfur and an anode that was simply a strip of aluminum that acted as a current collector. The electrolytes the researchers tested contained a lot of aluminum, sodium, and chlorine (typically something like eight Molar aluminum chloride and a 4.5 Molar solution of some sodium salt). The aluminum helps stabilize the foil at the anode, while the other two chemicals participate in the reactions that power the battery.

When the battery starts discharging, the sulfur at the cathode starts losing electrons and forming sulfur tetrachloride (SCl4), using chloride it stole from the electrolyte. As the electrons flow into the anode, they combine with the sodium, which plates onto the aluminum, forming a layer of sodium metal. Obviously, this wouldn’t work with an aqueous electrolyte, given how powerfully sodium reacts with water.

To form a working battery, the researchers separated the two electrodes using a glass fiber material. They also added a porous carbon material to the cathode to keep the sulfur tetrachloride from diffusing into the electrolyte. They used various techniques to confirm that sodium was being deposited on the aluminum and that the reaction at the cathode was occurring via sulfur dichloride intermediates. They also determined that sodium chloride was a poor source of sodium ions, as it tended to precipitate out onto some of the solid materials in the battery.

The battery was also fairly stable, surviving 1,400 cycles before suffering significant capacity decay. Higher charging rates caused capacity to decay more quickly, but the battery does a great job of holding charge when not in use, maintaining over 95 percent of its charge, even when idled for 400 days.

While the researchers provide some capacity-per-weight measurements, they don’t do so for a complete battery, focusing instead on portions of the battery, such as the sulfur or the total electrode mass.

But with both electrodes considered, the energy density can reach over 2,000 Watt-hours per kilogram. While that will undoubtedly drop with the total mass of the battery, it’s difficult to imagine that it wouldn’t outperform existing sodium-sulfur or sodium-ion batteries.

Beyond the capacity, the big benefit of the proposed system appears to be its price. Given the raw materials, the researchers estimate that their cost is roughly $5 per kilowatt-hour of capacity, which is less than a tenth of the cost of current sodium batteries.

Again, there’s no guarantee that this work can be scaled up for manufacturing in a way that keeps it competitive with current technologies. Still, if materials used in existing battery technologies become expensive, it’s reassuring to have other options to explore.

            <h2>Trump’s Golden Smartphone Is Getting Sketchier and Sketchier</h2>
            <p><strong>Futurism | 2026-01-07</strong></p>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">In June 2025, Donald Trump Jr. proudly announced the founding of a mobile operator called Trump Mobile, including a mobile virtual network operator offering services for $47.45 a month, and a gaudy-looking, gold-colored, $499 smartphone that was supposedly going to be manufactured in the United States.

The device, as experts quickly pointed out at the time, looked an awful lot like a mid-tier Android phone from a Chinese smartphone company, drawing plenty of skepticism.

But despite promising that the phone would be released in 2025, the company was seemingly caught off guard by the dawn of a new year, with the Financial Times reporting on December 31 that Trump Mobile was delaying the launch of the handheld, dubbed T1, blaming the government shutdown. (How exactly the shutdown impacted the private business remains unclear.)

Beyond having embarrassingly little to show and failing to abide by its own deadlines, the company has walked back one of its biggest claims, a clear attempt to distinguish itself from its competitors. As the Associated Press points out, after announcing that the T1 would be made entirely in the US, the company’s website now claims the device will have an “American-proud” design — a meaningless tagline that makes it sound a lot like the device, if it ever gets made, will be built somewhere else.

It’s likely that Trump Jr. finally realized that producing a smartphone in the US could be far more expensive, making such a $499 device majorly unprofitable. That’s something we’ve known for quite some time now, as exemplified by Apple’s plans to move production of its US iPhones from China to India. The plans greatly angered his dad, president Donald Trump, who insisted it was possible to build iPhones in America by boosting domestic manufacturing by heavily taxing imports, forcing Apple to adjust its supply chains.’

Trump’s monetary policies and steep tariffs have driven up costs, making a US-built smartphone an even taller ask.

“The concept of making iPhones in the US is a nonstarter,” Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives said last year, estimating that a price tag for an iPhone could triple if made in the US.

In other words, Trump Mobile failing to live up to its promises since its founding last summer isn’t surprising in the least.

“We have always been quite skeptical about this phone,” International Data Corp. analyst Francisco Jeronimo told the Associated Press.

For the time being, Trump Mobile is slinging used iPhones and Samsung Galaxy smartphones for prices up to $630.

“Maybe they changed their strategy and figured out they are better off just selling refurbished phones,” Jeronimo added.

Nobody knows whether the T1 is pure vaporware — the company is still collecting $100 deposits — or a misguided attempt to cash in on Trump’s unsuspecting supporters, who may not be clued in to the fact that they could be investing in a middling foreign-made smartphone.

Besides, $500 gets you a pretty decent phone these days — without ostentatious gold and a close affiliation with a president who has a decades-long track record of launching and sinking well over a dozen businesses.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The tech industry’s insistence on cramming AI into virtually every aspect of their consumer-facing offerings, from AI apps you can’t uninstall to hallucinating assistants that nobody asked for, has been nothing short of insufferable.

Tech enthusiasts and average consumers alike have watched helplessly as software and hardware they rely on to research, work, game, and keep in touch have turned into testing grounds for unproven AI tech — often without their consent.

Tech giant Microsoft has been at the epicenter of the resulting blowback, bearing the full brunt of the rage felt by many fed up with having AI shoved down their throat. It’s inundated its Windows 11 operating system with annoying AI features following the company’s doubling down on what it calls the “AI PC” last year, frustrating countless users, and most recently spawning the pejorative of “Microslop.”

Thankfully, vendors are finally starting to pay attention. As PCGamer reports, Windows PC maker Dell admitted at this year’s CES that things have really gotten out of hand.

Their executives are willing to say the quiet part out loud — that nobody is scrambling to buy an “AI PC.”

“One thing you’ll notice is the message we delivered around our products was not AI-first,” Dell’s head of product, Kevin Terwilliger, said during a pre-CES briefing, as quoted by the publication. “So, a bit of a shift from a year ago where we were all about the AI PC.”

“We’re very focused on delivering upon the AI capabilities of a device — in fact everything that we’re announcing has an [neural processing unit] in it — but what we’ve learned over the course of this year, especially from a consumer perspective, is they’re not buying based on AI,” he admitted. “In fact I think AI probably confuses them more than it helps them understand a specific outcome.”

It’s a notable change of tune, suggesting a promising sea change in the perspective of tech manufacturers. It’s a refreshing new perspective after years of companies promising us that all we needed in life was a little bit more AI.

But whether the company developing the operating system of Dell’s PCs will agree with the assessment that consumers ahve had enough remains to be seen.

In a rambling year-end post on LinkedIn, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella took umbrage with the term “slop,” arguing that “[w]e need to get beyond the arguments of slop vs sophistication.”

Nadella fumed that the company’s tripling down on AI will continue to be a “messy process of discovery, like all technology and product development always is.”

Indeed, tech companies like Microsoft and Dell have a lot still to prove until they can realize on their lofty promises about what AI can do.

For now, many new AI features remain infuriatingly useless, making us wonder if all of the risk and frustration will eventually be worth it in the end.

The fact that Dell is worried its AI-first approach may be hindering it from reaching new customers and making new sales, though, is telling.

Beyond Terwilliger’s eureka moment, Dell also admitted at CES that killing off its much-beloved line of XPS laptops was a mistake, officially reviving it for 2026 — and judging by the elated reactions the move has garnered, it was likely the right move.

Now, if only the hype surrounding AI hadn’t caused an astronomical rise in PC component prices…

            <div id="article-text">Fears over a growing AI bubble that could wipe out the entire economy if it were to burst continue to mount.

For many months now, investors and even tech leaders have openly been discussing the possibility — but if or when such a collapse could take place remains a subject of heated debate.

Nonetheless, investors are already preparing for that type of major tech sell-off, the Financial Times reports. The reporting shows that plenty of fear and uncertainty remain over the untold billions of dollars being poured into wildly unprofitable AI ventures — a dynamic that’s seen AI companies’ valuations skyrocket to record heights, despite dubious prospects of ever turning a profit.

Some are pulling back on their investments in major tech stocks, while others are outright betting on eventual drops in share prices.

“Whether there are excesses… in the equity market on AI is no longer questionable, but to figure out which exact companies will be the losers and when this reckoning will happen is difficult,” fund management firm Amundi chief investment officer Vincent Mortier told the FT.

One investment fund, Blue Whale Growth, sold its Microsoft and Meta stock in the second quarter of last year, with chief investment officer Stephen Yiu telling the newspaper that “we are concerned about the return on investment in some cases, while some of the valuations are insane — especially in private markets.”

GQG Partners chair Rajiv Jain added that “AI’s massive cash burn remains elevated with very little profitability in sight.” His fund sold all of its Magnificent Seven — investor shorthand for Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Tesla, Meta Platforms, Microsoft, and Nvidia — holdings.

“Though we had less exposure to a few Mag 7 names throughout 2025, we exited our remaining positions by early November because the risks of an AI bubble blow-up are growing, in our view,” he said.

At the same time, many remain unafraid of an imminent collapse.

“We don’t believe that we are in a bubble,” BlackRock international chief investment officer Helen Jewell told the FT, “but investors should prepare for a bumpy ride in 2026.”

Despite plenty of concerns among investors, banks remain optimistic about future growth. Wall Street has predicted double-digit gains this year. The S&P 500 has surged a whopping 92 percent since October 2022, posting double-digit returns for three years in a row now.

“2026 should be another strong year for AI stocks, with capex likely to surpass expectations,” JPMorgan’s Dubravko Lakos-Bujas wrote in a memo.

Others are far more muted about the outlook. Three years on from OpenAI’s launch of ChatGPT, some are starting to wonder how long the enormous hype surrounding AI can continue to be sustained.

In a 2025 retrospective posted on Monday, Bridgewater hedge fund founder Ray Dalio warned that the tech market is “now in the early stages of a bubble.”

But a crash, some argue, may still be some ways away thanks to plenty of remaining excitement.

“A bubble likely crashes on a bear market,” Cetera Financial Group chief investment officer Gene Goldman told Bloomberg. “We just don’t see a bear market anytime soon.”

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Not everybody agrees that replicating the four-limbed, bipedal shape of a human should be replicated in robot form. For one, walking with two feet is inherently less stable than four, nevermind a set of wheels. Replicating the dexterity and fine motor skills of human hands also remains a major challenge.

In a modified approach, Boston Dynamics has clearly decided to loosen up some of the restrictions of the human form. During an on-stage demonstration at this year’s CES convention in Las Vegas, Boston Dynamics showed off the agility of its humanoid Atlas robot — albeit with an unnerving degree of freedom of movement that dispels the illusion of a human entity.

Key to the demo is that the robot features clever joints that allow for “continuous rotation.” In effect, its hips, wrists, and neck can swivel a full 360 degrees unimpeded.

After confidently strutting to the front of the stage, Atlas starts twisting its hands like a drill, rotating its head like the girl in “The Exorcist,” and even turning its entire torso around in a dizzying maneuver — a clear indication that Boston Dynamics isn’t planning to be boxed in by the limitations of human anatomy.

“There’s more to it than just copying nature,” Boston Dynamics CEO Robert Playter said during the announcement. “We can pick the best parts of what nature has to offer and do better in others.”

The demo was part of Boston Dynamics’ announcement of a production-ready version of its Atlas robot. The Hyundai-owned firm also announced a partnership with Google’s DeepMind to bring AI smarts to its bots as well.

The firm claimed that it’s already working on a robot that can be deployed in a car factory. The plan is to deploy it at Hyundai’s EV manufacturing facility by 2028.

However, pricing and an availability date for the six-foot-two, 200-pound robot have yet to be revealed.

Beyond spinning its head and hands around freely, Boston Dynamics has shown how Atlas can manipulate car parts and even perform slick breakdancing moves.

“Atlas is going to revolutionize the way industry works, and it marks the first step toward a long-term goal we have dreamed about since we were children,” Playter boasted on stage.

Yet many questions remain about the tech’s long-term viability. For one, not everybody agrees that they make the most sense when it comes to actually replacing human labor. Experts have also warned that humanoid robots could be the next financial bubble.

When or if bipedal robots will be the form factor of choice, particularly when it comes to industrial settings, remains a subject of debate.

“I think the question comes back to what are the use cases and where is the applicability of the technology,” McKinsey partner Alex Panas told NBC News. “In some cases, it may look more humanoid. In some cases, it may not.”

Judging by its latest demo, Boston Dynamics is playing it safe by taking some liberties.

            <div id="article-text">If you were already skeptical — if not livid — about Microsoft’s ongoing campaign to drown Windows 11 with useless AI features, you’re really going to hate this video.

In a 30 second clip uploaded over the weekend, programmer Ryan Fleury demonstrates how even using Window 11’s purportedly AI-powered search bar to do exactly what it tells you to do doesn’t come close to working as advertised.

At the start of the video, the settings page search bar, with its gleaming AI icon, recommends searching “My mouse pointer is too small.” This goes against the common search function wisdom that you should look up using keywords, not entire sentences, but whatever: AI magic can take care of that for you, right?

But as it turns out, when Fleury searches “My mouse pointer is too small,” as exactly phrased by the search suggestion, nothing turns up. He waits around ten seconds with no luck, either. But when he looks up “test” afterwards, he gets three results.

“This is not a real company,” Fleury fumed.

He was joined by dozens of netizens who jeered the misfiring feature using a tough-but-fair new pejorative: “Microslop.”

Whether you like it or not, Microsoft isn’t backing off from basting Windows 11 with AI features. It’s ended support for its old operating system, Windows 10, in the hopes that you’ll upgrade and try out its Copilot-integrated successor, its AI chatbot slash virtual assistant.

The AI transformation is intended to be so sweeping that various executives have described the pivot in terms such as turning Windows 11 into an “agentic OS,” or better yet, into a “canvas for AI.” Some of the changes include putting an icon for Copilot in the middle of your taskbar and integrating Copilot into Windows Explorer, allowing you to right-click generate summaries of documents. Other features in the works include Copilot Vision, which lets the AI analyze whatever appears on the desktop display, and Copilot Actions, which lets the AI perform tasks on your behalf.

Many users fear that the deeply woven AI integrations pose a security risk, a fear that is informed by past Windows 11 AI blunders including when earlier versions of its AI “Recall” feature, which creates a history of your computer activity by taking constant screenshots of it, was caught saving sensitive data like Social Security numbers, and storing the screenshots in an unprotected folder.

The backlash against Microsoft’s AI pivot has quickly mounted ever since it announced it’d be ending support for Windows 10, but as anti-AI sentiment at large also heightens, the outrage has recently reached a boiling point with Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella’s recent plea that we should stop using the word “slop,” the new slang for describing low quality text, images, and videos mass produced by AI models. Unfortunately for Nadella, he unwittingly precipitated a classic case of the Streisand effect, and soon after his “slop” comments, the term “Microslop” suddenly went viral online.

“‘AI writes 90% of our code!!!!,&#39;” Fleury mocked, referring to boasts made by Nadella and other tech CEOs. “Don’t worry, we can tell.”

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Ever since it was first spotted hurtling through the solar system, Harvard astronomer Avi Loeb has maintained that there’s a chance mysterious interstellar object 3I/ATLAS is a technological object sent by an extraterrestrial civilization.

He’s meticulously catalogued what he claims are anomalous qualities of the object, which most of his peers believe is a natural comet from a different star system, from its unusually large suspected size to a rotation axis almost perfectly perpendicular to the Sun to a “fine-tuned” trajectory that brought it within spitting distance of Mars and Jupiter.

Loeb has also been angered at NASA’s continued insistence that 3I/ATLAS is a natural comet — which, again, is the opinion of most experts — accusing them of “arrogance” and ignoring his documented anomalies. He also accused NASA of withholding observations by its Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter while 3I/ATLAS made its closest approach to the Red Planet in October, due to last year’s government shutdown. (The images were eventually released in late November.)

NASA isn’t the government institution that Loeb is taking aim at. In a new blog post, the astronomer pointed out that ufologist John Greenewald Jr.’s Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) inquiry for “any assessments, reports, or communications maintained by the Central Intelligence Agency referencing 3I/ATLAS” had been pointedly shut down.

The CIA told Greenewald in a formal response to his FOIA that it will “neither confirm nor deny the existence or nonexistence of records” related to the object — a non-answer that could be interpreted in strikingly different ways.

Greenewald is a well-known name in UFO circles. He founded The Black Vault, an enormous archive of millions of pages of government documents he’s uncovered via FOIA inquiries, including declassified videos of what the Pentagon describes as unidentified anomalous phenomena.

Loeb says he found the answer — and the notable level of secrecy — “surprising,” given NASA’s conclusion that “3I/ATLAS is definitely a comet of natural origin.”

“If this conclusion was clear all along to everyone within government and academia — as NASA officials presented the case, then why would the CIA treat the possible existence of records dealing with a natural comet as sensitive enough to be classified?” he asked rhetorically.

Loeb suggested the government might have investigated whether 3I/ATLAS could pose a threat to national security, perhaps over the possibility of a “black swan event,” which has fascinated the researcher.

If scientists do eventually uncover a probe sent to us by an alien civilization, it could pose a major threat to humanity, Loeb has asserted. He has previously hypothesized that the object could be “akin to a Trojan Horse, where a technological object masquerades as a natural comet.”

Discussions about such a possibility may have been “hidden from public view in order to prevent panic from taking hold for no good reason,” Loeb pondered, especially considering a “black swan event is still regarded as highly unlikely.”

However, this theory presupposes that the CIA even has anything to hide from the public to begin with. After all, in its statement to Greenewald, it didn’t rule out the “nonexistence of records.”

Besides, as more data rolls in, Loeb’s far-fetched theory that 3I/ATLAS is a piece of technology continues to be challenged.

In other words, what would there even to hide if the object does turn out to be a non-threatening lump of ice?

Either way, Loeb isn’t ready to call it just yet. He has advocated for taking a closer look once it makes its closest approach to Jupiter in March.

“Unless we check, we might never know if this swan is white or black,” he concluded in his blog.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Lux Capital, a 25-year-old VC firm known for its investments in frontier science and defense technology, has closed a $1.5 billion ninth fund, the largest fund in the firm’s history.

Despite 2025 marking a 10-year low for the number of new VC funds raised in the US venture fundraising, according to PitchBook, it’s not hard to see why limited partners are still piling into Lux.

The firm has been investing in defense technologies for years before geopolitical shifts turned the sector into one of the most desirable investment categories. Lux was a seed-stage investor in Anduril, which was last valued at $30.5 billion, and Applied Intuition, an autonomous vehicle startup that secured contracts with the Pentagon and was valued at $15 billion this year.

Lux has also made early bets on AI startups before the industry took off, post-ChatGPT. The firm’s early-stage AI investments include Hugging Face, Runway AI, and MosaicML, the latter of which was acquired by Databricks for $1.3 billion in 2023.

In addition to being early to the defense tech and AI trends, Lux has realized significant exits from its investment in AI drug discovery company Recursion Pharmaceuticals, which went public in 2021, and the sale of Auris Health, a surgical robotics pioneer that sold to Johnson & Johnson for up to $6 billion in 2019.

The latest fundraise brings Lux’s under management to $7 billion.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">At CES 2026, AMC debuted clips from its upcoming TV series “The Audacity,” created by Jonathan Glatzer, a TV writer and producer for shows like “Succession,” “Better Call Saul,” and “Bloodline.” The new show will focus on how the men and women of Silicon Valley are shaping the world we live in today.

“They’re literally laying the cement on the freeway that we’re all driving down with things like AI, data collection, social media, etc. And there couldn’t be any more important group, in my opinion, to be taking a deep-dive look at than the men and women in Silicon Valley who are shaping the lives that we live,” explained Dan McDermott, chief content officer at AMC Networks and president of AMC Studios, speaking at the Variety Entertainment Summit at CES.

As one of the show’s actors, Billy Magnussen, noted, “Silicon Valley is one of those times in our modern era which is defining humanity. And what better place to make a dark comedy than in that place that develops our society at this point?”

The show will also star Sarah Goldberg, Zach Galifianakis, Simon Helberg, and Rob Corddry and will take place in a fictional universe where no real company names are involved, nor will high-profile tech figures make cameos. However, the show may still hit some familiar chords. For instance, Helberg’s character is a maladjusted genius, working on an AI therapy app for teenagers, when he himself is something of a recluse, with a teenage daughter he neglects.

“There’s loneliness, I think, at the heart of all the characters, and they’re all trying to connect, and they’re trying to connect through technology, which has some pitfalls,” Helberg says.

Two new clips from the shows were streamed at the event, but recording was not allowed. In one, an enthusiastic Magnussen pitches Galifianakis when encountering him eating at a restaurant. Galifianakis never responds but cuts him off eventually by stabbing him in the hand with his fork. Another clip showed Helberg completely missing an opportunity to relate to his daughter, and instead using her facial expression of annoyance to train his AI.

The show premieres Sunday, April 12 on AMC and AMC+.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Wall Street is once again whispering about a potential Discord IPO. Discord, the popular chat and community platform, filed confidential IPO paperwork with the SEC and has pinned its hopes on a debut in March, sources told Bloomberg. The company hired top-tier tech IPO bankers Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase as its underwriters. Should the tea leaves continue to look positive for this offering, the public could be getting a peek at Discord’s finances next month.

But we’ll have to wait and see. Even if investors are gung-ho, it’s not clear yet whether 2026 will become a better market for IPOs. Discord was reportedly in early-stage talks about an IPO back in March of last year. But then came chaos in the U.S. federal government — between the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE)-inspired budget cuts and the end-of-year federal shutdown — scaring off IPO hopefuls.

If the current stock market rally continues and encourages late-stage startups to go public, Discord’s IPO could be one of the biggest of the year. Discord was last valued at $14.7 billion in a 2021 funding round in which it raised $500 million.

The chat app, originally made popular by gamers, now claims more than 200 million monthly active users. The company reportedly walked away from a $10 billion acquisition offer by Microsoft in 2021 to remain independent.

            <div id="article-text">VC firms DST Global and Iconiq are piling into the London- and New York-based e-commerce startup Swap Commerce. On Wednesday the startup announced it raised a new $100 million round just six months after raising a $40 million Series B round led by Iconiq.

Founded in 2022, Swap Commerce offers an AI-powered platform that helps brands build web storefronts and handle cross-border transactions, inventory management, and returns. The platform has become popular with luxury clothing brands, and the company particularly targets companies looking to sell their goods globally. The company declined to comment on its latest valuation.

The fast, substantial funding from such prominent VCs marks Swap as a startup to watch, though Swap faces plenty of competition, including e-commerce behemoth Shopify.

Larco, who’s been investing in consumer and prosumer for years, thinks we’re about to see a shift in how consumers spend time online, with AI powering “concierge-like” services. The question is, will legacy consumer products like WebMD and TripAdvisor continue to exist as standalone apps, or will they just get absorbed into ChatGPT or Meta AI? And where can startups carve out an AI-powered niche for themselves?

Watch as TechCrunch’s ⁠Rebecca Bellan sat down with Larco on Equity to talk about why consumer is back, what OpenAI won’t kill, and where the real opportunities are hiding.

            <div id="article-text">Anthropic is gearing up to raise a fresh $10 billion at a $350 billion valuation, according to The Wall Street Journal. TechCrunch has confirmed the raise and valuation, according to a person familiar with the matter.

The Claude maker last raised a $13 billion Series F round at a $183 billion valuation three months ago, so this raise nearly doubles the AI firm’s value. In March, Anthropic secured $3.5 billion at a $61.5 billion valuation.

Coatue Management and GIC, Singapore’s sovereign wealth fund, will lead the new round, per the WSJ, which cited sources familiar with the deal. Anthropic is expected to close its latest financing in the coming weeks, and the total deal amount could change.

This round would be separate from the $15 billion Nvidia and Microsoft recently committed to invest in Anthropic, a “circular” deal that would see Anthropic buying $30 billion of compute capacity from Microsoft Azure running on Nvidia’s chips.

The fresh capital comes as Anthropic continues to win over developer hearts with Claude Code, its tool designed to automate coding, powered by Claude Opus 4.5. It also comes as Anthropic prepares for a potential IPO this year alongside its main rival OpenAI. OpenAI is also in talks to raise as much as $100 billion at a valuation of up to $830 billion.

This article was updated to reflect that TechCrunch separately confirmed the round.

On this week’s episode of The David Frum Show, The Atlantic’s David Frum discusses the American seizure of Venezuelan dictator Nicolás Maduro and President Donald Trump’s deeply flawed thinking about Venezuelan oil. David argues that Trump’s worldview of exploitation and predation is likely to doom his ambitions in Venezuela rather than secure them.

David is then joined by the national-security analyst David Rothkopf to examine the U.S. military operation in Venezuela and the Trump administration’s alarming lack of a coherent plan for what comes next. Rothkopf explores what it means for a president to sideline or altogether ignore the National Security Council before launching a major military action. Together, Rothkopf and Frum speculate about possible outcomes of the Maduro operation that Trump appears not to have considered.

Finally, David closes with his thoughts on Rudyard Kipling’s “Recessional” and the poem’s warning about national boasting, overreach, and the perils of collective foolishness.

The following is a transcript of the episode:

David Frum: Hello, and welcome to The David Frum Show. I’m David Frum, a staff writer at The Atlantic. My guest today will be David Rothkopf: broadcaster, businessman, journalist, author, but for our purposes today, the preeminent historian of the National Security Council and the foreign-policy process in the United States, author of the 2005 book Running the World, a history of the creation and development of the National Security Council. And we’ll be talking about the breakdown of that kind of judicious, careful guiding of American policy under Donald Trump, the emergence instead of a kind of clown show of whim and unpredictability and not thinking things through that is responsible for whatever it is that the United States is doing in Venezuela and for so much that the United States is doing around the world.

My book this week will not be a full book; it will just be a single poem. The poem is “Recessional,” by Rudyard Kipling, and I’ll be discussing it after the discussion with David Rothkopf. I hope you’ll stay to join.

But before getting to the dialogue and the poem, some opening thoughts about the dramatic events of this week. The United States finds itself having committed some kind of military operation in Venezuela. Exactly what has been done and why and to what end remains extremely murky—many, many stories are being told. But the president has given us an insight into his own particular thinking, and although it seems almost unbelievable that a person could think in such a way, we need to take it seriously because this is the president of the United States, and probably, what is in his mind actually drove this much more than any of the better or more rational reasons we’re hearing from more subordinate people in his administration.

Donald Trump seized the dictator of Venezuela, Nicolás Maduro, is now flying him to New York to stand, apparently, trial because he has an idea that the United States can take the oil of Venezuela—notionally, the largest oil reserves in the world, although there’s a lot of question marks and doubts about how big those oil reserves really are, but he thinks that the United States can seize them and enrich itself. This has been a consistent theme of Donald Trump’s. His big criticism of the Iraq War, led by President George W. Bush, was that the United States failed to take Iraq’s oil, and now he seeks to correct that mistake by starting some kind of conflict, maybe war, with Venezuela in order to seize Venezuela’s oil.

It’s a reminder that while, Donald Trump is often advertised as a great business leader—people who liked him in 2016 said often, and even later, people said sometimes, he thinks like a businessman—Donald Trump does not think like a businessman. Donald Trump thinks like a Marxist. Donald Trump thinks that wealth is something that exists, that is the product of exploitation, and that it can easily be seized and redistributed by one person to another. And this is a false way of thinking, in my opinion, but it’s especially false when applied to natural resources and to oil.

There is nothing less natural than a natural resource, and especially not oil. Oil is the product of human investment, human knowledge, human labor, and all of those things have to be paid for, regardless of who is the sovereign over the territory and whether the oil is found. And Donald Trump’s idea, I mean, it’s factually wrong. However big the oil reserves are—and, again, don’t believe the headline, because a lot of that is hype—but however big the oil reserves are, everyone agrees: Venezuela’s oil sector is in terrible shape. It will take an enormous amount of investment to bring oil back onto line—and not just in the oil wells. You are going to need roads and pipelines to the places where the oil is found. You are going to need tankers to take the oil away. You’re going to need an electrical power grid in order to power the machines that run the oil extraction. You’re going to need all the human apparatus: You’re going to need schools because the workers have to be trained. You’re going to need courts because there are going to be disputes. Who is going to take a dispute about Venezuelan oil to a judge picked by the Maduro regime? There’s gotta be an apparatus of honest law enforcement, honest conflict resolution. There’s going to need to be proper internet; how is that to be developed? All of this will cost an enormous amount of money.

And after the investment is made, it has to earn a return, as we discuss with David Rothkopf today. The price of oil today, as I record this at the beginning of January, is in the high $50-a-barrel range. That’s a price at which many people in the oil business are barely breaking even. The United States is the largest producer of oil on Earth. It’s the largest producer of natural gas on Earth. It’s the largest exporter of natural gas on Earth. But it is a relatively high-cost producer, and at $58 or whatever it is, the number as I speak, many American producers find it difficult to break even, certainly to make a profit, a return on their investment. The idea that they would agree that the United States suffers from this terrible shortage of oil and we need to go around the world stealing and robbing in order to get more of it will strike a lot of them as far-fetched, that they must be taxed to pay for the cost of a military occupation in foreign aid.

But even after the oil is produced in Venezuela—should that happen, in the unlikely event—the United States can’t just appropriate it to itself. That oil has to meet other needs. Just one example: Venezuela is one of the largest sovereign debtors on Earth. That money is owed to many people, to Americans and Europeans who had their assets confiscated by the regime. But it has a big debt to China as well, measured in the billions of dollars. Is the United States, as the new imperial overlord of Venezuela, planning to default on all of those debts, some of them? And if it’s going to pay them, that’s going to have the first claim on this oil wealth that Donald Trump proposes to develop in Venezuela at God knows whose expense.

Donald Trump thinks of capitalism as the way its worst critics do, as a system of exploitation and predation and seizure and confiscation and redistribution, when, actually, what you would like to see any American president think—and maybe especially a Republican president—is to understand that markets are systems of cooperation. Markets are a system to entice people to part with their savings, to entrust their savings to some productive purpose, in hope of earning a return, of directing savings to their best and highest use, of finding ways to reduce costs and increase revenues through the application of human know-how to technical problems. This is what the free-market system in which we think we believe, in which I believe, should stand for.

But Donald Trump thinks, like its worst critics, that capitalism is about robbery. And rather than refute that argument, or rather than saying that’s an argument against capitalism, the way the socialists do, Since it’s a system of robbery, therefore, let’s try something else, he says, Since it’s a system of robbery, let us use the mighty armed forces of the United States, paid for by the taxes of the American people, to go around the planet robbing people so that I can deliver some windfall to the people who have paid for a breakfast table at Mar-a-Lago and have put poison in my ear about who I should rob first and who I should rob next.

As I say, it’s going to fail because the problem with this way of thinking is not just that it’s invidious, not just that it’s demeaning, not just that it belittles the extraordinary achievements of the free-market system that has made the wealth of the United States and the developed world together. It’s also false. It’s also just not going to work. The United States is on its way either to finding that it’s achieved nothing in Venezuela—and that may be not one of the worst outcomes. It’s kidnapped somebody, put him on trial. He’s a bad guy; maybe he deserves it. Maybe he’ll be convicted, maybe not. But anyway, no question he’s done a lot of bad things, and he oughta be held to account for them; that’s fine. But if they’re going to transform Venezuela, that is a big undertaking and one that the Venezuelans are going to have a large voice in, whether it succeeds or not, whether it’s received peacefully or not. It’s their country; they get a voice in what happens there. And when people are denied a voice, they can resist, and they will resist, often, with violence. That’s been the story of many imperial adventures all over the world, American and other peoples as well.

We need to have a better way of thinking about how wealth is produced and how energy wealth is produced than we are offered by the United States government. It just seems that we are being led by people who are, at best, childish and, at worst, robberlike in their attitude toward the economy, toward the planet. The United States is not a nation of robbers; it’s a nation of cooperators. It’s a nation that exports ideas of freedom; it doesn’t steal other people’s wealth and import it to the United States. There’s no shortage of wealth in this country. It’s the richest country ever in the history of the world. It doesn’t need to take somebody else’s portion that oughta be somebody else’s endowment, someone else’s heritage to build their wealth, and take it for Americans. If it would work, it would be a shame, and it’s not going to work.

Frum: David Rothkopf is a man of so many accomplishments that it is impossible to do justice to them all, yet potentially stingy to select only a few. But at the risk of being stingy, let me hit some highlights. David is the host of the Deep State Radio podcast, which has developed into a network of related programming on the [DSR] Network, of which he is the founder. He is the author of more than 1,000 articles, which appear these days most often at the Daily Beast. He was a managing director at Kissinger Associates, the consulting firm, and then founded a consulting firm of his own. He served in the Commerce Department of the Clinton administration, promoting international trade and commerce. He is the author of the book that inspired this discussion, Running the World: The Inside Story of the National Security Council and the Architects of American Power, published in 2005—in my opinion, the definitive history of the development of the central bureaucracy of national-security decision-making. He’s superbly qualified to discuss the topic of our program today, which is: Why is the Trump foreign-policy process such a clown show? And fittingly, as a man of the world, he is speaking to us from Paris.

So, David, let me set a stage for you and draw on your deep knowledge of the National Security Council and its history. The United States has undertaken this military operation in Venezuela. It has seized the former dictator and sent him to New York, where he will, apparently, stand trial, and a series of explanations are being offered for this action, which are pretty hysterically contradictory: that this is being fought to do justice; to curb drugs, to stop illegal immigration; to restore democracy to Venezuela, although we’re leaving the dictatorship regime intact; that it’s about oil.

An ominous possibility occurs to me that the reason there’s so many different explanations is not just that this administration doesn’t tell the truth—although they don’t—but actually, they never sorted out why they’re doing what they’re doing, because they’ve broken the mechanism for doing that, which is the National Security Council.

And last point: Trump appointed a national security adviser at the beginning of his administration, Michael Waltz. Waltz was separated from—Trump says it was a promotion—in May 2025, he was sent over to the United Nations. Supposedly, the job is being done by Secretary of State Marco Rubio, but that means, probably, no one’s doing the job at all.

So tell us a little bit about what the National Security Council is supposed to do and why it seems to be malfunctioning in this administration.

David Rothkopf: Well, the National Security Council has two main purposes. One is policy development, policy coordination, and the other is overseeing policy implementation. It’s been referred to in the past as the “policy hill.” You get all the agencies of the United States government working together to make some recommendations to a president, the president evaluates the recommendations, and then, when the president makes a decision about how to act, the same agencies use the same mechanisms to ensure that the implementation is consistent both with the president’s desires and the proposals, as they’ve been laid out.

Problem here is Donald Trump doesn’t really want recommendations. He doesn’t like expert perspectives. He doesn’t listen to expert perspectives. And, frankly, he doesn’t really want any filtering between his direction and the implementation of his guidance. And so the NSC, which has grown over the years from a smallish group in the Eisenhower and the Kennedy administration to, in the last couple administrations, an agency that was several hundred people in size, it’s now shrunk back down to 30 or 40 professionals, the size it was under Henry Kissinger in the ’70s. And, frankly, as you say, there’s nobody running it, really. The experts aren’t actually being listened to. And it’s kind of like the appendix—it’s a vestigial organ that is primarily there because it existed in prior administrations.

Frum: So it’s obviously confusing and a little suspicious when an administration can’t explain why it’s done a military action, which may have large consequences. But explain how it would be actually harmful to the interests of the United States that we don’t know whether this is about bringing an alleged malefactor to justice, whether it’s about curbing drug trafficking, whether it’s about curbing illegal immigration, whether it’s about bringing Venezuelan oil back to market, whether it’s about restoring Venezuelan democracy, or whether it’s about keeping the Maduro system intact but without Maduro at the top. Why does it matter that we don’t know what we’re doing and why?

Rothkopf: (Laughs.) Other than the fact on its face that if we don’t know what we’re doing, it could produce a problem; if we don’t have objectives, it produces a problem. But look, in a good advisory process, you’re gonna have people telling you things that may be salient, right, like it would be illegal to arrest Maduro. It would be illegal to invade Venezuela. It would be illegal to seize the oil assets of Venezuela. The oil assets of Venezuela will take many, many billions of dollars to restore to any kind of productivity. Although Venezuela has the largest oil reserves in the world, the oil that the country produces, a lot of that oil, is a dirtier kind of sulfuric oil that costs more to produce. That the United States didn’t really have the claims to that oil that the president asserted that we did. That, while we might get Maduro out, there are many factions in Venezuela who would press back against Trump, whether they do it immediately or they do it more slowly—there is the faction that was elected in the last election, including the Nobel [Peace] Prize winner [María Corina] Machado, who Trump apparently did not want to take over the country, because she had the audacity not to refuse the prize and step aside in favor of him getting it. But it’s not just the political factions even within Maduro’s own party. It’s not really clear that the army is lined up alongside the former vice president. The former vice president has some strange ties to Russia, which we’re not quite sure of. We’re not sure what the Russians will do. We’re not sure what the Iranians, who have close ties, will do, etc., etc., etc.

And so these are the kind of things that a president who is concerned about the long-term success of an operation might wanna know about and that Trump has just sort of swept aside, and even in the past 48 hours, every single one of these things has manifested itself as a potential problem for what comes next in this operation.

Frum: Well, you allude to one, which is the most obvious pressing problem, the biggest one, which is: Trump has this fantasy that he’s somehow going to save money by stealing other people’s oil, with no idea that, first, stealing is not a route to wealth and riches, and this oil is going to be very, very expensive. And by the way, it’s Venezuela’s oil, so if they do succeed with not billions, but hundreds of billions of dollars of investment, because you have to invest not just in the oil wells, but in the roads, in the electrical system to supply the power to get the oil out of the ground—it’s a big, big investment; that has to come from somewhere—Venezuela already has a giant sovereign debt.

So they haven’t thought any of these things through. And as you say, one of the things that may happen is, they’ve brought Maduro in front of an American court; it’s not clear that he won’t be able to come up with defenses in front of an American court. What happens if he’s acquitted? Has anybody thought about that?

Rothkopf: Well, I don’t know that they have thought about it, and of course, there are a lot of reasons that he might be acquitted. The court might say it doesn’t have jurisdiction. The court might say he was illegally kidnapped from the country. The court might take issue with some of the points in the indictment. Part of the case against Maduro is that he’s the head of a so-called or alleged cartel called the Cártel de los Soles, which isn’t actually a cartel; it doesn’t actually exist. It’s a little like antifa. It’s kind of a zip code for a bunch of alleged bad actors. Who knows how well the case has been put together. We’ve seen a lot of cases put together by the Trump Justice Department falling apart because they’ve been mishandled from a legal perspective.

So that could happen, but just to go back to your other point, there are stories now coming out that oil companies are a little reluctant to go in and take on the task of the spending of the tens or hundreds of billions of dollars it’s gonna take to restore the Venezuelan oil industry. There are a lot of reasons for that. One is that hundreds of billions of dollars is a lot of money, but another is there’s no assurance that the next government of Venezuela is not gonna come in and say, This stuff was illegally seized; we want it back, and that you could go and spend hundreds of billions of dollars, and the day after you’re finished, the Venezuelan government go, It’s not yours anymore, buddy, and they’d have a pretty good case.

Frum: Well, there’s another, which is oil is trading right now at approximately $58 a barrel. And if you’re an oil company, say, the price is low right now; I’m barely breaking even. If I have a hundred billion dollars to invest, I’m not sure I want to invest my money in oil. And if I’m going to invest my money in oil anywhere, I’m going to invest it in the United States or Canada, where it’s safe. And with the United States being the largest oil producer in the world, North America producing 28 percent of the world’s oil supply, why wouldn’t you say, Let’s just spend a small amount of money and put it in Texas and all go to stay in nice hotels in Houston, rather than the Orinoco jungle? (Laughs.)

Rothkopf: Right, but also particularly if that jungle’s filled with guerillas or other people who are saying, This isn’t your oil, and they’re blowing up things along the way. But think about how this is gonna sit with Trump’s friends in the Gulf or Trump’s friends in Russia, who are all in the oil business, and if he comes and brings this oil onstream, and the price of oil goes down further and further, and they get further and further away from their break-even point, it’s gonna be bad news for them.

And also, does Trump wanna enter into OPEC? (Laughs.) Is that the future for U.S. energy policy? Whatever Trump may be doing, the rest of the world has come to the conclusion that alternative forms of energy are cleaner and safer and also cheaper, and so he may wanna perform mouth-to-mouth resuscitation on the fossil-fuel sector, but he may not be able to pull that off either.

Frum: Okay, so you identified some problems here, and this is what interagency processes exist to do—and not always to say no, but just to say, Mr. President, have you thought about your scheme to steal oil? None of us, of course, will criticize that because you are the president, but it may turn out to be a money loser. Your scheme to seize and abduct this bad actor in Venezuela—we all agree he’s a bad actor—and bring him to trial in New York: He might be convicted; he might sue you afterwards if he is acquitted. (Laughs.) There might be a lawsuit from the Maduro family about unjust detention. Have you thought about that? Have you thought about thing X, Y, and zed? There’s a process to think about that, and that’s the thing that’s broken, that we’re missing.

The United States has tried, at various points in the past, to do without a national security adviser—most famously, Henry Kissinger, like Marco Rubio, was simultaneously secretary of state and national security adviser at the same time. Tell us a little bit about how the Henry Kissinger experiment worked or didn’t work, bearing in mind that it’s Henry Kissinger, a person of extraordinary talent.

Rothkopf: Well, but Henry Kissinger was an active adviser who sought to be the primus inter pares among the advisers, as opposed to a president who doesn’t wanna listen to any advisers. But Kissinger did this power play, so he ran the NSC and the State Department at the same time—

Rothkopf: It was during the Nixon and the beginning of the Ford administration. And I spoke to Ford in doing one of my books, and he said the single most important thing he did was to put Brent Scowcroft in charge of the National Security Council and break the job up so that it was not all Henry Kissinger.

And that goes to one of the core points, right? When you have advisers, you wanna have multiple points of view; Kissinger wanted the president to have one point of view. And Ford wanted a little bit more fair play among his advisers, and Scowcroft, the only man to serve as national security adviser twice, had a big advantage in that he was seen as—the term of art that has emerged—as an “honest broker,” right? He was seen as the guy who would present all the viewpoints of the Cabinet to the president so the president could fairly decide among them. And of course, Scowcroft did this then again for George H. W. Bush and was seen as the model for doing it right, precisely because he had lived through the period when it was being done wrong.

Frum: Well, Scowcroft, an Air Force general, career military, was an intensely self-effacing man but who had a great ability to develop intimate relationships with the presidents he served, relationships of trust. But what happened—and correct me if I have this wrong—Kissinger was doing both jobs. He was a national security adviser, first and foremost, who also happened to occupy the State Department, a bureaucracy he disliked and distrusted, and he was trying to neutralize the State Department so they didn’t get in the way of his National Security Council. That was his main job.

What seems to be happening with Rubio, who is both secretary of state and, theoretically, national security adviser, is he’s just being secretary of state and no one’s being national security adviser, because the deal that seems to have been struck in, at least based on what I read in the funny papers, is that Rubio gets to run Latin American policy and some other things as well. Trump is running Russia and Ukraine policy himself, with the aid of some people—Steve Witkoff and other people. And so the deal for Rubio’s power is, if he agrees to accept that he’s in charge only of part of the world, he can be both secretary of state and not have to worry there’s some national security adviser who’s going to circumvent him. But there isn’t someone doing that job of bringing everything in front of the president, including such basics as Maduro might be acquitted.

Rothkopf: There are a few things I would take issue with in the characterization. First of all—

Rothkopf: —Kissinger was attracted to the prestige of the office of secretary of state, moved his office over to the State Department, had some of his closest aides doing the work for him in the State Department. He was trying to negate voices that contradicted his voice, but he later would complain that by moving his office out of the West Wing primarily—or some of the time out of the West Wing—that diminished his influence. And he famously said to me that, in the policy world, like in real estate, what matters most is location, location, location, and being down the hall from the president mattered a lot.

Rubio’s deal is, technically, as you describe it, except in reality, what’s emerged is this: Witkoff is the secretary of state for Ukraine and Russia. Witkoff is the secretary of state for the Middle East. China policy is now being run by, of all people, Stephen Miller, who is the deputy White House chief of staff for domestic affairs but also happened to be lurking in the background during the press conference we saw on Saturday and has an oversized role in the administration.

And I think it’s important to remember that, even with this division of the world—and, by the way, Rubio’s also the head of USAID and the archivist of the United States, by the way, just to throw that into his portfolio—but Trump doesn’t take anybody’s advice. And so, even in this case, it is being reported that, in the wake of this carefully planned military operation on Saturday, Trump walked out, said, We’re gonna run Venezuela. And then somebody said, Well, who? And he said, Well, these people up here on the stage. And Rubio has spent the past couple of days backing off of that because there was no plan to run Venezuela. This was the president improvising. And there still is no plan to run Venezuela. Rubio’s trying to say, Well, the way that we’re gonna do it is that we have influence, and we can stop oil flows, and the military will threaten them, and that’s how we are going to exert our power. But of course, that’s not how you run a country.

Even in the past when the United States has gone in on oil wars or trying to do nation-building, we’ve had a terrible track record even when it was extremely well planned. And in this particular case, they are just riffing, making stuff up, and mostly kind of cleaning up on Aisle Trump. Trump will say something, and these people then have to scramble behind him to clean up the mess.

Frum: Well, there are millions of refugees, or exiles, from Venezuela, many of them in Colombia, other Latin American countries, some in the United States. Not only Americans, but many of Venezuela’s neighbors would like to see those people go home. Many of those people would like to go home. They’re needed at home. What’s the plan to get petroleum engineers back to Venezuela to help their country?

Rothkopf: On the one end, Trump has said in the past day, Well, I’ve talked to the oil companies. They’re eager to do it. We’re gonna leave it to our great American oil companies to handle that. Of course, the oil companies have a different story. A part of the problem goes back to what you’re talking about is the core issue here, which is: Trump has one reason for doing what he is doing, which is oil. Rubio has another reason for doing what he’s doing, which is sort of he’s from a Cuban American family; he’s got a long-standing bone to pick with Cuba. He certainly wanted to go after Venezuela ’cause of its ties to Cuba. Of the scores of people who were killed in this operation, by the way, a bunch of them were Cuban military. Taking the oil away from Cuba, the revenue that goes through Venezuela away from Cuba, could put pressure on Cuba. So Rubio has a slightly different agenda. Obviously, the Justice Department and the people involved in drug interdiction have another agenda. Stephen Miller and the people involved in refugees and immigration have yet another agenda. And none of that stuff is being coordinated, and none of the conflicts are being worked out.

If I may, one additional thing: In the course of the presidential press conference on Saturday, or the past 48 hours, the president and his aides have also sequentially threatened the president of Colombia, who Trump said needs to “watch his ass”; the president of Mexico, who Trump said did not control Mexico, and he was gonna have to go after the cartels; the government of Cuba, which Rubio said he’d be worried if he was in the government of Cuba; and the government of Denmark and all of NATO because Trump said, Yeah, we need Greenland, and we’re going after Greenland.

And so yet another set of issues that you might get discussed in a normal policy process is: Well, what happens if it’s not just one illegal takeover and the chaos that causes, the unintended consequences? What if it’s four? What happens with all of that as your alliances are blowing up, and the price of oil is blowing up, and drug cartels are waging war against the U.S. government, and so on and so forth. So they are unleashing a lot of problems out of the Venezuelan Pandora’s box, and nobody has thought through what the consequences may be.

Frum: Well, one of the things that you would think in a policy process would happen is somebody would say to President Trump, It’s true that the present president of Colombia is an unhelpful person, and many people in Colombia would head the queue to say it. But he is leaving power in 2026. Colombia has been a longtime, very faithful security partner of the United States against both drugs and terrorism. There’s probably, after May of 2026, going to be a Colombian president much more willing to cooperate with the United States. That’s where the largest group of Venezuelan exiles are. If you can just keep your mouth shut until May, Colombia’s going to be a, potentially, extremely crucial partner. And when you say things like, Our American oil companies are going to solve the oil problem in Venezuela, first, that’s a fantasy. But second, everyone else will say, I guess that means your European Union allies are off the hook for any reconstruction expenses—because Trump, with his predatory attitude, thinks he’s gonna steal a lot of money. In fact, Venezuela, should there be a true regime change, not just a swap of one dictator for another, but a true transition to something democratic, Venezuela’s going to need a lot of help. And maybe down the road at some point, they will be self-sufficient because of oil, if the world is still using oil in the 2030s and 2040s. By [in] the 2020s, they are going to have needs, and is the United States signing up to meet all of those needs? Because if you exclude your partners, you’re also saying the bill falls entirely on the American taxpayer.

Rothkopf: Yeah, and, again, geopolitics is about knock-on effects, right? Fiona Hill, six years ago or seven years ago now, talked about how there was a perception in the Russian government that maybe a swap could be done where Russia could get Ukraine and the United States could have Venezuela. And there are going to be connections between whatever America’s Venezuela policy is and whatever might happen in Ukraine on several levels, and one of them is if the U.S. is involved in a big rebuilding effort here, which might happen, how much can we spend on a big rebuilding effort in Ukraine?

If we wanna have our way in this hemisphere, how much leeway are we gonna give the Russians or, parenthetically, the Chinese for having their way in this hemisphere? If we decide we’re gonna take Greenland as part of this whole thing, and we alienate all of NATO, which we are trying to have bear the burden of the issues in Ukraine, what is the consequence of all of that gonna be? And so on, and so on, and so on.

And by the way, if you go after the Colombians and you go after others in Latin America and you trigger, among at least some of the countries of Latin America, a desire to move together and counterbalance the United States, what happens when they say to the Chinese, You know something. We’d rather deal with you. We’re gonna sanction the U.S.? China’s already the No. 1 investment partner and the No. 1 trading partner of almost every country in the Americas, South America. What happens when they open the door more to China? We’ve seen that in a country—and I’d be interested, frankly, in what you have to say about this, that you’ve written better about than a lot of the people out there and almost anybody out there—and that is another of the countries mentioned in the past 48 hours by Trump: Mexico.

Trump has said some really outrageous stuff about Mexico and saying that President [Claudia] Sheinbaum [Pardo] is not actually in charge of Mexico; the cartels are in charge of it, and he’s gonna have to go in and clean up the cartels—well, Mexico’s one of our top trading partners, top trading partner of China, deeply involved in all the immigration issues we have to deal with, has a lot of other issues with the U.S. What happens if he alienates one of our closest partners in the world, not to mention your native Canada?

Frum: Yeah. Well, the Mexico part worries me a lot. It’s not wrong that there are large parts of Mexican territory where the authority of the Mexican state does not govern and where cartels are in charge. That is an enormous problem. That’s not something to use as an argument. That’s something that both countries should be very, very worried about. And Claudia Sheinbaum, although she comes from the Mexican far left and comes from an anti-American ideological tradition, has, in fact, worked with the Trump administration to an almost politically self-endangering degree. Her approach to Trump has been total appeasement. And the United States is flying drones over Mexico, which they originally did, I think, without Mexican knowledge or permission; they got the knowledge or permission after the fact. The drones are supposedly unarmed, but who knows whether that’s true. And there are a lot of people in the Trump administration who wanna—including Stephen Miller, whom you mentioned, and the vice president, who are on record as calling for American unilateral military strikes inside Mexico, with or without the consent and knowledge of the Mexican authorities.

The danger here is that you collapse the Mexican state because—

Rothkopf: Well, it’s also not the first time that Trump’s done this. And Trump, during the last Trump administration, floated the idea of shooting at Mexico, launching missiles at Mexico. And it took the secretary of defense at the time, the head of Homeland Security at the time to say, No, Mr. President, you can’t actually attack Mexico, but he doesn’t have people who will say that to him this time. And that’s what makes this pretty scary.

Frum: Let’s talk about how the National Security Council might have worked. One of the things I was really struck by was this new National Security Strategy, which theoretically emanates from the national security adviser, although, again, there isn’t one. There is an archive of all the past reports—I won’t pretend I’ve read all of them. I noticed there were seven issued by the Clinton administration, which is a lot; normally, it’s one to an administration, or so it seems. So I read the one from Trump 1, from Biden, and then from Trump 2.

So the one from Biden is just a giant blurry committee report, obviously written by—no single person [who] could write anything this dull; it took a team of highly trained professionals. (Laughs.) And it’s mostly about not saying anything that’s untoward in any way, so that’s not very useful.

Trump 1 was a basically normal document; it was issued by National Security Adviser H. R. McMaster. Some spicy jalapeños in it, but basically pretty normal.

This one reads like it’s written by people working for a very right-wing college magazine. It’s just—

Rothkopf: Or the Kremlin. Because the core concept behind this last National Security Strategy is the idea of viewing the world through this idea of spheres of influence, which is this Putin-esque idea, which is, essentially, bully states get to determine what happens near them. And so Russia can have Ukraine; China can have Taiwan; the United States can have whatever it wants in the Caribbean, Central and South America. And Trump has really bought into that idea. Within the document, there is the so-called Trump Corollary to the Monroe Doctrine—I’d love it if somebody asked Trump who [President James] Monroe was, ’cause I’m pretty sure he doesn’t know. But Trump does like the fact that people are now referring to it as the “Donroe Doctrine,” which is—I think people are making fun of him, but he doesn’t realize this. And he made a reference to it during the press conference. And the Donroe Doctrine essentially is: We not only will defend our hemisphere; it’s that we wish to dominate our hemisphere.

Frum: That’s not even new. There was a thing called the Roosevelt—meaning Teddy Roosevelt—Corollary to the Monroe Doctrine. And Teddy Roosevelt asserted a right of the United States to use the Monroe Doctrine to intervene in the affairs of the smaller nations of the Caribbean and the north shore of South America, although Roosevelt himself was not an enormous interventionist; he seized Panama from Colombia, or encouraged a revolution in Panama against Colombia. But under his next successors, under [President William Howard] Taft and then [President Woodrow] Wilson, the United States—and under [Presidents Warren G.] Harding and [Calvin] Coolidge as well—became a very aggressive military presence all over the Caribbean.

So that was tried for a third of a century, and it led to a lot of pretty catastrophic results. It was also expensive. So Franklin [D.] Roosevelt’s Good Neighbor policy was a repudiation of the Teddy Roosevelt Corollary to the Monroe Doctrine, so we’re not doing this anymore. We are going to support friends, but we’re not going to use direct American military intervention, except in the most extreme circumstances in this hemisphere.

Now, again, there are deviations: [President] Lyndon [B.] Johnson in the Dominican Republic and some pretty nasty, and usually counterproductive in the long run, CIA interventions. But this Donroe Doctrine was originally tried by Teddy Roosevelt and tried, tested, rejected.

Rothkopf: Yeah, and, again, it comes out of that period of history where [William] McKinley, a president Trump really likes, was flexing the United States imperial muscle for the first time. But it was quite limited, and typically, throughout that period, we were looking for certain kinds of justification for what we are doing, which we are not really doing under Trump, although it is important to note, as you did, that this period did exist and that a lot of what we were doing in that part of the world was on behalf of U.S. companies—not oil companies at the time, but, for example, banana companies in Central America. And it really rubbed the American military the wrong way that they were being sent off to fight wars in these countries on behalf of American corporate interests.

And you start to see the rumblings of that here. And I think this is gonna be a source of some of the pushback that Trump is gonna get here. And of course, this is anything but America First policy, and it is already starting to alienate many in Trump’s base—which, by the way, is something that a policy process would, in a parallel process, address among perhaps the political advisers to a president, and that isn’t happening either.

Frum: Yeah. When we talk about that document, the security strategy, as blurry as some of them have been, like the Biden document, they’re an exercise in saying, Means and ends need to be brought into harmony. So here are a bunch of things you want in the world. Here are the means that the political process will accept that you use, both in terms of expense and in terms of trouble, and in terms of reputational risk. So let’s try to bring them into some kind of harmony. And that means we have to have some definition of priorities: what’s most important, what’s must-have, what’s good to have, what we can live without. The United States wants—or used to want—to bring more democracy and more human rights to more places, but it can’t do all places all the time at once. There are better opportunities in some places. There’s more demand. There are more effective partners. So can we work in a coordinated way?And that whole project of bringing means [and] ends into harmony seems to be jettisoned. I think even the Kremlin has made some effort to bring means into harmony with ends. That’s why I said it read like something from a right-wing school paper. It’s called a “strategy”—it didn’t do the strategic work of thinking, What are we trying to accomplish? How do we do it? What means do we have available? If you’re trying to assert a greater American residence in this hemisphere, what are you trading away? Who’s going to help you? How much will you spend? How big a commitment are the American people willing to expend to get American oil concessions in Venezuela? (Laughs.) And the United States is the world’s largest oil producer, and the oil companies are barely breaking even on the oil they make here.

Rothkopf: Yeah, well, and another subset of the issues associated with what you’re talking about here that has been central to U.S. foreign policy, including in oil wars of the past that you may remember well, is: What about our allies? What about the rest of the international system? In the past, particularly in the first Gulf War, the United States really went to some lengths to put together a kind of international coalition because they felt that that was adding legitimacy. That takes a lot of work. The diplomacy involved in it, as you know, is extremely complicated, involves lots of work by different agencies. All the countries have different issues involved and so forth. Trump has just tossed that aside as well. He does not really care what anybody else in the world thinks about us. Even at our most unilateral, in the George W. Bush administration, there was at least some discussion about it. There is no discussion about it.

Frum: In the Iraq War of 2003, there was a big international coalition, many, many partners: Britain, Spain, Poland, others—I think Ukraine was there, if I remember right.

But this gets to a point that I think I now am reproaching myself for not having raised earlier, because one of the things that people need to understand about the National Security Council is it’s not a body of mandarins who spend their careers on the National Security Council. There are some, but mostly, it is people who are secunded from other agencies of the government. So if you’re a president who thinks, I’m worried about climate disaster as a national-security threat, you bring in lots of people from agencies with those expertises. If it’s 2008, 2009, and you’re worried about international debt crisis, you bring in people from the Treasury. And they serve on the National Security Council, although their salaries are paid by Treasury or whatever other agency, and that gives you this kind of breath of circulating air. And it means, among other things, that you’re very likely to have people who have served in other countries,, especially in the military, but [also] in diplomatic services and other services, may speak foreign languages, may have contacts. And at the center, there is a way to not succumb to this building syndrome, but to actually have a wider view of the world, and if you break that, then all we’re hearing from are the interests of Trump’s donors, who are willing to spend money at Mar-a-Lago.

Rothkopf: Yeah, and there’s a corollary to that as well, which is that the Trump administration came in waging a war against what it called the “deep state,” which is the career professionals in all of these agencies, who have this huge amount of experience and a long history of putting the interests of the U.S. and the Constitution first. But Trump didn’t trust them; he wanted loyalists—not just in the White House, but in all of these agencies. In the national-security process, you would have the views of multiple agencies expressed, but before the agency said something in an NSC meeting, there were a bunch of meetings in the Pentagon or the State Department or the Commerce Department or the Treasury Department to develop a view internally there, and particularly in a giant agency like the Pentagon or an agency like the State Department, those discussions were often extremely wide-ranging, had a wide range of points of view.

Well, do you think that’s happening in Pete Hegseth’s Department of Defense? Of course it’s not. Because Pete Hegseth doesn’t trust people with differing views. Pete Hegseth is trying to suppress differing views. Even today, the day we’re recording this thing, Pete Hegseth has taken out after Mark Kelly, a senator, for having expressed a view from the Senate floor, which was well within his rights to express, saying, Oh, former military shouldn’t have separate points of view, and we’re gonna punish him by demoting him and reducing his pension. And he’s fired generals and admirals because they had different points of view. And so you’re getting not only the elimination of the NSC, but you’re getting an elimination of the processes within each agency that enriched the ultimate policy discussion.

We are having, essentially, on a remarkably fast, wide-ranging basis, a lobotomy being performed in the United States government at precisely the wrong moment because we have a president who is purely an impulse engine with no sense of history and who needs to be constrained by that kind of process, which he is eliminating.

Frum: Well, one thing that this process is supposed to do is, there needs to be somebody at the table who is there to ask the question, What if this doesn’t work out the way everyone here thinks it will? We all hope it will; we all hope it will all go fine. But what if it doesn’t? What if there is a guerilla resistance inside Venezuela? Have we thought about that? Do we have a contingency plan in case there is? Have we decided, whatever goal we are seeking—and we have four or five goals—will that goal seem worth it if we find ourselves eight months from now dealing with dead-end remnants of the Maduro regime who’ve taken weapons and gone into the jungle? Is there a history—yes, there is—of guerrilla resistance in Venezuela and Colombia? Do we wanna fight that?

And presidents have to take risks; they often have to be prepared to face the risk of the worst-case scenario. But they need to know what it is. They need to have someone there saying, Here’s what would happen if things go wrong. That’s the story of the Iraq War and the administration in which I served, was there was lots of planning, there was lots of thinking, but there was a refusal to take seriously, What if our hopes don’t come true? And the administration bet everything on best-case scenarios: You can do it with 110,000 troops. Resistance will collapse. The best-case scenarios turned out not to be true, not to happen; the worst-case scenarios happened. And no one had ever asked the question, Would we do this if the worst-case scenario were a realistic possibility? And the answer to that is, often, Well, in that case, we probably wouldn’t. It isn’t worth it.

Rothkopf: There are, in the history of the NSC, which was created with the National Security Act of 1947, example after example of where the policy process let us down. In Vietnam, it let us down. In Central America, during the Reagan administration, it let us down. In the forever wars in the Middle East, it let us down. In some other areas that we might talk about, in climate policy or dealing with pandemics or whatever, it let us down. But it’s a whole heck of a lot better than nothing.

When we’re talking about the Bush 43 administration, looking at best-case scenarios, we’re not even looking at those. A best-case scenario takes you a few months down the road; we’re not looking a few months down the road. And so our experience is that no policy process is perfect, but the absence of a policy process is infinitely worse than the presence of even a flawed policy process.

Frum: That’s a great place to put a bookmark and to resume this conversation again. David, thank you so much for your time, for taking time away from your wonderful afternoon in Paris, so grateful to you. And I recommend to everybody: our book on the NSC is really an invaluable history of something that is, to many of us, a closed box, and you opened the box and helped us see both what the NSC is, what it was, how we came to this place—2005, as relevant as ever, Running the World. And I learned from it so much, and I think others will as well.

Rothkopf: Thanks very much, and it’s good to talk to you, David.

Frum: Thanks so much to David Rothkopf for joining me today on The David Frum Show. As I mentioned at the top of the program, my book this week is not a book; it’s just a single poem. And the poem is “Recessional,” by Rudyard Kipling.

You will know Rudyard Kipling as the great poet of British imperialism. He lived from 1865 to 1936. He’s gone very out of style because of his imperial message, but since the Trump agenda in South America seems so nakedly imperialistic—about seizing other people’s wealth and taking it for oneself—I thought it might be a moment to return to the poetry of imperialism and to hear sort of some warnings, even from Rudyard Kipling, about what it is the United States has undertaken.

Kipling was born in what is now India, in Bombay. He died in London. He lived for four years in the 1890s in the United States. He married an American woman and lived in Vermont. That’s where he wrote Jungle Book, which became the famous Disney movie—other stories too: Captains Courageous as well.

He could be vainglorious and boastful and show all the ugly face of race arrogance and national chauvinism. He’s probably most notorious for his line “the White Man’s burden,” which is a line from a poem he wrote actually congratulating the United States on his acquisition of colonies in the Philippines. But Recessional, which was written in 1897, in time for Queen Victoria’s 60th anniversary, her Diamond Jubilee, it also contains one of his most notorious lines, although this line is widely misunderstood. The line is “lesser breeds without the Law,” which, you will hear, is not actually a statement of race arrogance but is a criticism of Britain’s Germanic opposite numbers during the arms race of the 1890s because he found them boastful and rude and arrogant. It was not an expression of racial arrogance, as you will see; it’s an expression of something else.

So I wanna read two paragraphs from “Recessional.” It’s a short poem, and you can find it online very easily. But I wanna read two paragraphs that I think of a lot when I hear the Trump administration talking, and especially the president and his secretary of defense, or “secretary of war,” as he styles himself, Pete Hegseth, with their endless invocations of how great the United States is, how tough the United States is, how it’s not gonna consider anybody’s interests ever except its own. And these are the two paragraphs in the poem that I hear in my head a lot every time those men speak. The title refers to the music that is played as a congregation exits a church after a service or a wedding or some other memorial. And you are to hear that tone of exit and religion through this poem. Here are the two paragraphs:

If, drunk with sight of power, we loose Wild tongues that have not Thee in awe, Such boasting as the Gentiles use, Or lesser breeds without the Law— Lord God of Hosts, be with us yet, Lest we forget—lest we forget!  For heathen heart that puts her trust In reeking tube and iron shard, All valiant dust that builds on dust, And guarding, calls not Thee to guard, For frantic boast and foolish word— Thy mercy on Thy People, Lord!

I think we’re hearing a lot of frantic boasting and a lot of foolish words, and as the great poet of imperialism, with all its arrogance and racial feeling and wrong and crime attached to it, if he could warn us against conducting ourselves in that kind of way, well, that’s a warning that ought to occur to everyone in a position of power in the United States. America has used its power so often as a force for good. It is a humiliation and a shame to see that urge to good be so dismissed, be so ridiculed, even, by an administration that wields so much power on behalf of people, most of whom I think are deeply embarrassed and ashamed of the way in which this administration conducts itself at home and in the world.

            <h2>The View From the Palisades</h2>

            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/2026/01/palisades-la-fire-one-year/685535/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">This weekend, I stood on a bluff in the Palisades where houses used to be. Los Angeles rose to my left, and the sky had the dramatic clouds we get in the winter when it rains, as it has for a few weeks. The hillsides have turned to Irish green, but the burn scar, below, is still black. Twice, when my family drove past during the holidays, our phones blared with evacuation alerts for possible mudslides and flooding. Since last January, whenever the rain has been heavy, people living near the burn areas have had to sandbag their homes and field evacuation warnings.

Where the Pacific Coast Highway runs through the burn area, the speed limit slows to 25 miles an hour, and building equipment is scattered along the shoulder. What used to be the Malibu Feed Bin—a red barn where one could find both horse feed and a gigantic metal sculpture of a giraffe—is now a collection of temporary offices for the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power’s utilities-rebuilding projects. Inside the Palisades, most of the old landmarks are gone. The Building Block—a 1920s Spanish Colonial building known for being light pink, like the inside of a conch shell—has a piece of its facade still standing.

In the year since the fire, the Army Corps of Engineers has hauled away millions of tons of debris, in what the governor’s office has called the fastest major-disaster cleanup in American history. Most lots are empty now; the city of L.A., which oversees most of the Palisades, has approved rebuilding plans for about 14 percent of the homes destroyed, according to the Los Angeles Times. Paradise moved more slowly toward rebuilding after the 2018 Camp Fire, and Santa Rosa, after the 2017 Tubbs Fire, went much more quickly. Almost 80 percent of the homes lost in the Tubbs have been rebuilt; in Paradise, about a quarter of homes have come back.

Each disaster is different, Kathryn McConnell, who studies wildfire rebuilding at the University of British Columbia, told me: Population size, socioeconomics, and land value all can influence the rate at which a community recovers. But no matter what, a year—even though it can feel like many more when you’re waiting to return home—is not very long in the timeline of disaster recovery.

I saw very few people in the Palisades this past weekend, but the community had left messages on the houses and businesses. A banner on a garden gate: Thank you to all our wonderful neighbors! We can rebuild this beautiful town together. On an elementary school: Returning in January 2028. The CVS, which was spared by the fire, still had signs up from its grand reopening in August. (Across the street, a notice from the L.A. Department of Water and Power read DO NOT DRINK THE TAP WATER.) One of the more frequent lawn signs I saw on empty lots was THEY LET US BURN, a call to come to a protest against city and state agencies that’s happening this morning. There were many FOR SALE signs, and then, over and over again, ones that read instead, This home will rise again.

Paul Horvitz, a lifelong friend of my father whose ranch home of 45 years burned in the fire, was among the first homeowners in the Palisades to get a rebuilding permit. It helped that he’s a mortgage lender and knows more about the real-estate system than many people: Once the rain ends, he will be ready to start construction on his house, which will no longer be surrounded by bougainvillea but will be made entirely of fire-resistant materials. Other Palisades Fire survivors are entering the permitting tedium that survivors of the 2018 Woolsey Fire, in Malibu, have been navigating for years—finding out, for instance, that the plans they used in the ’70s are no longer up to code, or that they’ll need to raise their coastal home higher off the sand to comply with upgraded flood-elevation guidelines. Even a wealthy place like Malibu might rebuild slowly, in part because its geography is so complicated. About 600 homes burned there last year, and about one-third of the owners have put in permit applications. As of New Year’s Eve, only 22 homes have been approved to rebuild.

But rebuilding is only one way to measure recovery. In Malibu, my childhood friends and I realized that all of the restaurants where we’d normally gather at the holidays had burned. In Altadena, a chef whose restaurant survived the Eaton Fire, told CBS that when he goes to work, he thinks, This was a neighborhood restaurant. It always has been. And now there’s no neighborhood. Jennifer Champion and her family lost their house but have moved into a condo in one of the Palisades’ more intact neighborhoods; still, she says not a day goes by that she doesn’t think about how much the fire took. Families of the 12 people killed in the Palisades Fire will gather for a ceremony today.

Everyone wants to make the next fire less brutal. Michael Rohde, an emergency-management consultant and a retired battalion chief with the Orange County Fire Authority, grew up just south of L.A., where he could see a fuel break the width of eight bulldozers on Mount Wilson. These types of clearings are meant to slow fires down by limiting the material they have to burn, but a large, indiscriminately placed fuel break like that probably won’t do much good when winds can carry embers for miles, Rohde told me. In Southern California in particular, clearing away strips of flammable brush could actually make the problem worse by inviting invasive grasses, Max Moritz, a wildfire specialist with the University of California Cooperative Extension, told me. He and other researchers have been beating this drum for decades. Already, the too-frequent fires in L.A. create an opening for these species to grow back instead of the native chaparral, Alexandra Syphard, an ecologist for the Conservation Biology Institute, told me. These are the grasses making the hills green right now, but by the summer, they dry into brown fuels that ignite more easily than the native plants.

Fuel breaks can still help during a fire, researchers and firefighters both told me, when placed along roadways and directly around housing developments where firefighters can access them. But the breaks need to be used more sparingly than they might be in forested land, and placed more deliberately. As part of the area’s recent fire-resiliency projects, public-land organizations have now been working on smaller, strategically placed breaks. Michael O’Connell, the president of Irvine Ranch Conservancy, told me that the IRC and its partners are developing some fuel breaks that replace nonnative grass with heavier, less flammable shrubs and cacti. Still, only recently has the state begun to manage Southern California fires as their own distinct problem. What works in the forests of Northern California, where fires are fueled by the forest itself, might not do as much in Southern California, where the most destructive fires are propelled by strong winds.

Those winds will return here; some of the people, homes, businesses, and routines will too. But many will not. Horvitz told me that some of his neighbors are still deciding whether they’ll come back. One who already moved away worried the place would just burn again; another had lived there for decades and took the fire as a sign it was time to go. Along one stretch of the Pacific Coast Highway, the Reel Inn (a restaurant with surfboards in its rafters, and good fish tacos), Wylie’s Bait and Tackle (a shack opened by Bill Wylie in the ’40s, now owned by his granddaughter), and the Topanga Ranch Motel (bungalows from 1929, where Malibu kids would wait for the school bus) all burned and are now behind a chain-link fence. California State Parks, which owns the land, told at least the Reel Inn that it would not be renewing the business’s lease; then, after a local uproar, it told the restaurant it wanted to figure out a path forward. For the moment, when I drive on PCH at night, silhouettes of bare bluffs and hills, just barely darker than the sky behind them, line one side of the road. On the other side used to be homes. Now I can see the ocean.</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">For his tireless work promoting the cause of children’s diseases, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is being inducted into the Virus Hall of Fame today. The ceremony will feature light roadkill hors d’oeuvres, goblets of beef tallow, and a sewage plunge, and will include a memorial tribute to the parasitic worm that perished after eating a portion of his brain, but whose influence continues to be deeply felt.

In announcing the honor, the viruses praised Kennedy for being the first to buck the long-standing family tradition of fighting to better children’s lives: “Where other Kennedys mindlessly rushed to broaden access to health care, advocate peace, or improve children’s circumstances, only RFK Jr. had the courage to take a step back and say, ‘Let’s hear the other side.’”

“It’s easy to love children and want what’s best for them,” a representative from the virus league explained. “It’s hard to look deeper and say, What about the virus in that child’s lung? Who’s looking out for it?”

“He’s been our guardian angel,” a weeping respiratory syncytial virus added. “We were on the brink of destruction, and—he spared us.”

The disease-spreaders commended the secretary’s work altering the schedule of childhood vaccines, noting that, although technically these are just guidelines, and states and families can still make their own decisions to vaccinate, anything that makes vaccination more confusing and difficult is a big win for viruses.

“For offering a gracious home to a parasitic brain worm, even for a time, and for his indefatigable efforts to reintroduce the noble measle back into the wild, we here at the Childhood Diseases Consortium (CDC) are proud to claim Robert F. Kennedy Jr. as one of our own,” a plaque reads. “For his work making the lives of those scientists still trying to do their jobs at the Other CDC a living nightmare, and for the many ways, large and small, that he advances the cause of viral disease, we offer this small tribute to our most ferocious advocate and strongest defender. Whether he is repeating the words gold-standard science until they lose all meaning, traveling the world with a personal holster of sauerkraut, or doing something we think is intended to be a pull-up, the secretary will always know that we’re honored to have him in our corner. Wherever we go, whomever we touch, we feel we’re carrying on his legacy.”

The evening was to feature a performance by a children’s choir, but too many of them are reportedly under the weather.</div>

You could almost detect the clenched teeth and pursed lips in Tulsi Gabbard’s social-media post. “President Trump promised the American people he would secure our borders, confront narcoterrorism, dangerous drug cartels, and drug traffickers,” the director of national intelligence wrote on X yesterday afternoon, days after the capture of Venezuelan dictator Nicolás Maduro. “Kudos to our servicemen and women and intelligence operators for their flawless execution of President Trump’s order to deliver on his promise thru Operation Absolute Resolve.”

It was Gabbard’s first and only comment on the raid. She has not always been so reticent about American pressure on Maduro. For many years, while serving as a Democratic member of the U.S. House, Gabbard was a leader of the clique that fiercely opposed American intervention abroad, casting it as part of a dark imperial history.

“The United States needs to stay out of Venezuela,” she posted in January 2019. “Let the Venezuelan people determine their future. We don’t want other countries to choose our leaders—so we have to stop trying to choose theirs.” A few weeks later: “The US needs to stop using our military for regime change & stop intervening in Venezuela’s military.” Still later that spring: “Throughout history, every time the US topples a foreign country’s dictator/government, the outcome has been disastrous. Civil war/military intervention in Venezuela will wreak death & destruction to Venezuelan people, and increase tensions that threaten our national security.” She was even clear on why the U.S. kept rattling its saber at Caracas. “It’s about the oil … again,” she wrote. (Justin Amash, another former representative and a critic of U.S. intervention, recently rounded up Gabbard’s past comments.)

Now Gabbard is a member of the administration, and the president whom she serves, Donald Trump, is saying openly that the whole thing is mostly about the oil. (Energy Secretary Chris Wright said today that the U.S. would control the Venezuelan oil industry “indefinitely.”) She’s gone from critic of imperialism to agent of it—and if she objects, she hasn’t done so publicly.

Gabbard is not alone as a noninterventionist suddenly cast into a tricky position. Steve Bannon, the president’s ex-consigliere, has also opposed U.S. military actions abroad. Bannon has neither the inclination nor, with a daily online broadcast, the ability to stay as quiet as Gabbard. Over the weekend, he praised the effectiveness of the military operation but questioned what comes next and whether Trump has planned for it: “So is this part of overall Hemispheric Defense, and we’re going to clean up this mess in Latin America? Or is this just the neocons talking him into it?” (This position puts Bannon in line with many mainstream Democrats.)

No silence has been so conspicuous as that of Vice President J. D. Vance. One of the few beliefs that he has not been quick to jettison for political advancement is his opposition to American military interventions, which he connects to his experience serving in Iraq. This spring, in a group chat to which Trump officials accidentally invited Atlantic editor in chief Jeffrey Goldberg, Vance grumbled to colleagues about strikes intended to preserve navigation in the Red Sea. “I just hate bailing Europe out again,” he wrote.

In recent days, though, Vance has been not only silent but absent. He was not present Friday night when the administration set up an impromptu war room at Mar-a-Lago, and he was also not part of the press conference the next day where Trump celebrated the mission and talked about taking over the Venezuelan oil industry. Instead, the front man for this operation has been Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who was a foreign-policy hawk before remaking himself as a Trumpist; as it turns out, that wasn’t such a transformation after all. Rubio’s ascendance is notable because Vance and Rubio are widely understood as rivals for Trump’s mantle. (“I’ll give you $100 for every person you make look really shitty compared to me,” Vance told a Vanity Fair photographer last year. “And $1,000 if it’s Marco.”)

What all of these figures understand is the importance of staying on Trump’s good side. Bannon was exiled from the first Trump White House; he has since mastered the art of diverging just enough from the president that he sometimes takes flak but never gets banished from the fold entirely. Gabbard already saw the dangers of getting crosswise with the president when she implicitly warned against the bombing of Iran this past summer, before quickly falling back in line. One more break might get her sacked.

No one has as much to lose as Vance, though. He is clearly the front-runner to succeed Trump and is desperate to lead the MAGA movement once Trump leaves office, but yesterday’s January 6 anniversary is a reminder of how viciously Trump can turn on a vice president who doesn’t support him in all things—he even watched indifferently while a mob threatened to hang Mike Pence. Vance may not like what’s going on in Venezuela, though unless he says so, no one knows. Until then, his willingness to keep his mouth shut speaks loudly. For Vance, deeply held principles are fine, but staying in power is even more alluring.</div>

We have one of these in our home. It was a housewarming gift. It&#39;s not connected to the Internet, but still displays art. The frame matches the other items surrounding it on the wall. It brightens and dims as the light changes. It&#39;s also a really good TV. We love everything, except that there is an external box that required we install a flush-mount box behind the TV to hide the wiring and keep the illusion of &quot;art&quot;.

Ours works fine without an internet connection.

The purpose of a screensaver was avoiding burn-in on screens prone to it, like CRTs and plasma displays.

LCDs and power saving modes mostly killed them off.

Yeah, how much power does this consume when it&#39;s &quot;off&quot;?

The Frame was the only TV that actually was flush against the wall.

Isn&#39;t the digital display of artwork, it&#39;s keeping advertisements out of the display.

Oh, but they&#39;ll never put ads on art screens (rolls eyes).

We&#39;ve had $200 55&quot; tv hooked into a raspberry pi zero displaying family photos and art for years and we have complete control over what gets displayed - it&#39;s not connected to the public net in any way..

My 2019 LG OLED pretends to be a painting when it has no input, picture frames and all.  You can have it do the same instead of turning off properly but that just seems insane to me.  My more recent LG OLED monitor is the same.  This isn&#39;t some recent catch-up from LG.  The marketing feels like they&#39;re doing it to highlight the image quality and HDR of their high-end displays.

If you get rid of all the premium seats, 100% of those people aren&#39;t going to be jammed into crappy economy seats. They&#39;ll look for other, likely more inefficient, ways to travel and they will all land on private aviation. The trend is going that way already.

Plus consider the economics, most airlines make a significant amount of their money from premium passengers. No way they&#39;ll go for this either.

Also, and highly relevant from an ancient @GSElevator Twitter joke:

Junior: Have you seen that new all-business-class airline thatâ(TM)s launching? It looks pretty great.

Junior: Well, everyone on the plane is in Business Class, so it&#39;s a better experience.

MD: Exactly. If everyone is in Business Class, then I&#39;m in Coach. Where do I sit to show I&#39;m better than you?

Exactly.  Pipe dream delusions.  I can fix this one thing without affecting anything else.

private aircraft is in nooo way comparable to a first class or any other &quot;premium&quot; seat, are you dumb?

No, if you&#39;re talking &quot;Learjet&quot; it is much better.  Even a turboprop King Air, and not putting up with the various abuses of dignity administered by TSA as well as &quot;the rulz&quot; for TSA that they themselves violate anyway (personal experience, so yes, it happens, and was moderately expensive)  will be a probably unsuspected driver for people to abandon scheduled airlines altogether in search of some comfort and tranquility undisrupted by &quot;the authorities.&quot;

I&#39;m not in the same stratosphere of those that fly 1st

Flying private starts at about 2x the cost of a first-class seat. I suspect most of the people who could fly private are already doing so, and if there were no business class a lot of those people would fly coach.

The profitability issue is a bigger problem: premium seats have the least people per square meter but generate the most dollars per square meter because they&#39;re disproportionately expensive. At a lot of airlines, coach tickets are effectively subsidized by rich idiots:

....by getting rid of premium seats, ensuring flights are near full

So, you think that airlines are going to get rid of &quot;premium&quot; seats, which generate more profit.  Are you really that stupid and clueless?

It seems like letting the peasants enjoy the world is causing them to destroy the world.The people who live in popular tourist destinations would agree with that.

See also, congestion charges. Reduce traffic by making it too expensive for the poors to drive where the traffic is!

The solution to flight emissions isn&#39;t to make flying an exclusive privilege for the rich again, it&#39;s to pressure businesses to pay workers more of the fruits of their own labor so they can afford carbon capture to offset the emissions produced during their flight. Workers should be making at least 40% more money right now for starters.

Here in the USA, many people are obsessed with SUVs and trucks, yet they never go offroad, they don&#39;t use these vehicles for work, they just want BIG vehicles for a really stupid reason, all the other stupid people around them that insist on having a large vehicle.   Sure, there is a good use for having ONE larger vehicle in a family for when you need it, but the actual NEED for these huge vehicles is pretty low.

I really don&#39;t understand why Americans drive and fly everywhere.
The USA is a big place. Our stuff is pretty spread out. How else would you propose we get from point A to point B?

they just want BIG vehicles for a really stupid reasonThe reason is simple: it&#39;s fun. You should look up that word (&quot;fun&quot;) in the dictionary sometime.

they just want BIG vehicles for a really stupid reason

The reason is simple: it&#39;s fun. You should look up that word (&quot;fun&quot;) in the dictionary sometime.

I know what fun is, and the inconvenience and ill handling of a huge ungainly vehicle isn&#39;t it.

Americans mostly want huge vehicles because they&#39;re afraid - of the consequences of a wreck. They want to be some distance from, and ideally &quot;upstairs from&quot; where the wreck happens, which is what drives the ridiculous safety arms race we&#39;ve been trapped in since the &#39;90s.

It&#39;s also safer in an accident. The more mass your vehicle has, the more the impact is absorbed as you run down the tiny little shoebox that pulled out in front of you.

Physics not your strong point is it. Its crumple zone size and structural  strength that matter. Stick the driver of some bloated pickup at the front like in a bus and hes as good as dead in a collision with anything larger than a motorbike and the extra mass will help him on his way.

For some people, burning down forests is fun. That doesn&#39;t mean we&#39;re okay with it.

If you want to drive a large vehicle for fun, then pay for it with a carbon tax.

The need is low, but this all goes back to the revised standard for MPG requirements based on vehicle footprint in 2011/2012 CAFE standards. Larger vehicles (Long/Wide) get more leeway on MPG. The current version was implemented back in 2012 under the Obama administration and was later revised by Biden. The current standards the industry has been using do not incentivize small vehicles as the MPG requirements are too high to generally achieve with budget focused internal combustion engines.

Second, my first response is, &quot;It&#39;s more complicated than putting more people on a plane.&quot;

-- More people = more weight = more fuel = more cost for all passengers-- Currently, coach and business class tickets pay for their extra amenities and subsidize coach/economy classes. Like toll lanes subsidizing local transit by bleeding the people willing to pay for extra convenience, they&#39;re a net benefit.

Lastly, making airline travel less GHG-intense per passenger is a good goal, b

Or we could just start riding unicorns, it has about the same chance of happening.

So, we the masses are justifiably miffed when we learn that the rich snobs in first class are responsible for higher fuel consumption per square foot.  However, we are also miffed when we are crammed into ever smaller economy cabin seats, even though those smaller and more tightly packed seats are fantastic for cutting fuel consumption and emissions.

Even more important is not the ratio of fuel consumption or emissions per seat.  The only thing that matters is the total absolute fuel consumption and emission

Expect a boatload of spam from Exchange Online tenants. Followed by the imposition of rate limits.

This has been a cyclical phenomenon for several years, maybe a decade by now. Spammers abuse the system, Microsoft cracks down, Microsoft does a reorg, someone with no historical context reverses the throttling, the spammers come back, and the cycle repeats...

I wonder how many of the &quot;complaining customers&quot; were in fact astroturfing spammers.

Exchange Online customers who need to send legitimate bulk commercial email (for example, customer newsletters) should use third-party providers that specialize in these services.

Can someone translate that headline into English?

Microsoft is lowering limit on the number of external emails (outside of your domain) you can send from your Microsoft domain. If you truly need to bulk-send email, then use a 3rd party sender like Constant Contact or SendGrid.

I had a recent convo with one of our sysadmins at work recently, one of his main job duties is maintaining the servers in place for email and he had asked in a rhetorical way how long email has been around (since the 70s) and given the massive increase in spam/phishing that the Internet has seen especially in the last 1-2 years, how realistic it is to expect email to continue on as a service 15 or 20 years down the road.

It hadn&#39;t occurred to me before then that this was a possibility, but I see his point --

how realistic it is to expect email to continue on as a service 15 or 20 years down the road.I&#39;d assume greater than 50%. The reason E-mail outlived all of its contemporaries of gopher, ftp (mostly), and nntp (mostly), is because the alternatives are worse.What would replace e-mail? Slack/Google Chat/MS Teams? It hasn&#39;t yet, even amongst people in the same domain that have those tools as options. This applies to all the consumer chat apps like BBM and Whatsapp; the former has been gone for decades and proves *why* - when vendors decide to nuke a chat service, the data goes away with it. Email still

Making installed apps stop working?  What a controlling move, Apple.

Unless revoked, an app&#39;s signature is supposed to remain valid forever, so long the certificate was valid when the app was signed, even if the certificate has since expired.  If that isn&#39;t happening, then Apple needs to fix the regression in its code signature validation.

There&#39;s no such thing.  Certs for code signing are issued by Apple and have a fixed validity period.  Timestamping proves when the code was signed.

apple wants apple store only with the upto 30% cut

I only buy mice that have all configuration in the mouse itself and do not require any app or driver on the computer. Since I use both Linux and Windows machines via a KVM switch, that was a really easy decision. It was harder finding ones that match that requirement.

Personal preference? Check out Redragon (https://redragon.com/) keyboards etc. I&#39;m typing on YAMA K550. I use my KVM between OpenBSD, Linux, and Windows. Macros are stored in the keyboard and be recorded without host software. (Windows software is available, but not mandatory.) I have found the keyboard to be resilient. Their mice seem good also.

Logitech can do this, but it&#39;s kind of buried. You have to create a GHub profile with the settings you want, then transfer them to the mouse&#39;s &quot;on-board&quot; settings. This disables the ability to dynamically switch multiple profiles depending on the app that&#39;s running, though.

I am using a Logitech keyboard and mouse right now.  You don&#39;t have to install any special software to use them.  They work just fine as a generic keyboard and mouse.

Their software is only required if you want to use custom special functions (programmable keyboard shortcuts).  Everything else just works normally under Windows and Linux.

Signed binaries, certificate expired, MacOS won&#39;t let binary execute.

No you just disable the option for the OS to require certificates for apps.

Obviously you need software, like a mouse driver.But, shouldn&#39;t all these features essentially be buttons. Shouldn&#39;t the OS be providing standardized interface to this?

I left windows for linux such a long time ago that news like this confuse me...

No problems with my ancient Logitech M557 on LInux.

No problems on my S100 bus CP/M machine either!

Some of the comments here show complete ignorance.  The Logitech app for their mice has zero to do with Apple!  Neither is it some &quot;consequence of using a Mac&quot;. Logitech even said, right in the original article summary, that their Windows G-Hub application was also affected!

The real problem, as I see it, is that too many utilities or applications people traditionally assume are stand-alone actually function interactively with cloud servers. When an SSL certificate expires, things break.

You don&#39;t even really need these additional software applications to use basic input devices like keyboards or mice, except 3rd. party manufacturers love to enhance these items with non-standard wheels, buttons, colored lights or sliders. The base operating systems don&#39;t recognize all of that extra stuff.

Ok, my confusion was with this statement:  &quot; Logitech has since acknowledged the situation and said that its G Hub app -- a similar management software for gaming devices under the Logitech G brand -- was also affected.&quot;

As far as I was aware, all those G branded gaming devices and the related G Hub software was primarily Windows-centric.  (Most gamers aren&#39;t using the Mac platform.)

I agree I made a false assumption there. But my original statements are still basically valid.  In this instance, they&#39;re compl

It&#39;s the same with their newer webcams - even basic functionality (e.g. zoom, focus) requires some clunky, slow, buggy &quot;Logi&quot;-branded application to be running all the time.

Probably because it saves them 4 or 5 cents a unit in manufacturing costs somehow...

On Monday, Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro and his wife Cilia Adela Flores de Maduro were arraigned in a federal courthouse in New York City on charges of drug trafficking, continuing what has been a stunning first few days of 2026. The criminal proceedings—and likely trial—ahead are sure to be rocky and closely watched around the world. How exactly, though, will the Justice Department’s charges against the Maduros play in a court of law? We talked to an expert to find out.

“This is not a trumped-up case. This appears to be a real solid indictment,” Adam Pollock, a former assistant attorney general of New York and now a managing partner of the law firm Pollock Cohen, told me. Pollock believes the U.S. government has built an impressive case against the Maduros, with the indictment suggesting there are cooperating witnesses, recordings of drug deals, and direct links between the Maduros and Venezuelan drug-trafficking networks.

Still, the disturbing and complex facts of the Maduros’ arrest—during an apparently illegal military raid of the country Maduro was leading—makes this case anything but a slam dunk. While entering a plea of not guilty on Monday, the Venezuelan leader told the court that he had been “kidnapped.” “I am innocent. I’m a decent man,” Maduro said during his arraignment. The couple did not seek bail, and were transferred to a New York City jail. Their next court hearing is on March 17.

What comes next? What are all of the charges the indictment makes? What kind of defense could the Maduros use? I spoke with Pollock to get some answers to these questions and to understand the full breadth of the DOJ’s indictment. Our conversation has been edited and condensed for clarity.

Shirin Ali: After reading the entire indictment, how strong of a case do you think the DOJ has here against the Maduros?

Adam Pollock: This is a really robust indictment. You’re dealing with the Southern District of New York, the United States Attorney’s Office, which is a really serious office that doesn’t bring trumped-up political charges. If you compare this to the indictments of James Comey or Letitia James, that were super stamped-on details, very bare-bones, hard to know what the charges were. Why? Because those were vindictive political prosecutions. Here, we have a robust indictment full of detail, meetings, descriptions of events, and going back for, I think, almost two decades. And how do you get this information? You typically have to have either wiretaps or recording in the rooms, or what appears to be the case here is a witness who is cooperating.

There are quite a bit of allegations of actual meetings, payments, and involvement of the Maduros. This does not appear to be a case of him and his wife sitting up at the top of government and turning a blind eye to drug trafficking. To the contrary, there actually seems to be direct involvement.

Let’s start with Count 2, cocaine importation conspiracy. I was a little bit surprised here, because the State Department estimated 200 to 250 tons of cocaine were trafficked through Venezuela annually. That’s a lot of cocaine, but doesn’t strike me as a giant number. In general, the United States has had a long-held view that if you commit a crime abroad that affects Americans, then you’re subject to our jurisdiction. You can think about that in many areas, not just drugs, but financial crimes or child abuse. You can think of many areas where merely sitting abroad is not going to immunize you from the reach of American prosecution. And certainly we’ve had a long-held view that drug trafficking that affects Americans is subject to American jurisdiction. So that’s Count 2.

With Count 1, narcoterrorism conspiracy, basically what they are talking about is that the Maduro government apparently supported these rebel groups in Colombia, the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Columbia and the National Liberation Army. Those are designated terrorist groups within the United States, and it is long-standing American policy to oppose those groups and designate them as terrorists. The indictment is saying that the Maduro government supported them through helping them with drug trafficking. Count 3, possession of machine guns, sort of collapses back on itself and also gets to the question everyone’s asking: Is it lawful to arrest the sitting president of a country? Traditionally, there’s been a view in international law that it is not, and certainly that is a defense that Maduro will raise pretrial. In that trial, the United States is going to say that he was not the legitimate leader for two reasons. First, they’ll say Maduro was illegitimate because he was a drug trafficker—that is kind of a tautological argument, but it’s one that will be made. Second, they will say he stole the last two elections.

Is it lawful for heads of states to have armies that have machine guns? Probably. But if they’re really not legitimate heads of states, but actually drug traffickers, and they’re using those machine guns as part of a drug conspiracy, then that adds on as a charge. And then the last charge is the conspiracy to possess machine guns and destructive devices, which is effectively, the same thing.

The indictment also charges Maduro’s son, Nicolás Ernesto Maduro Guerra; two Venezuelan government officials; and a leader of Tren de Aragua, the Venezuelan transnational gang, as part of this narcoterrorism conspiracy. What exactly happens to them now?

Now you start to intersect politics with prosecution. Clearly there was a political motive to bring a large Army force to arrest Maduro and his wife. You don’t expect that a similar military operation would be mounted to arrest the other defendants. Instead, they’ll now lead a more constrained life, where they’ll need to be concerned that, if there’s a change of government, whether they’ll be continued to be protected if they travel abroad and where they can travel to. Life as an indicted felon is harsh, even if you’re abroad; you can kind of continue to live in sanctuary in Venezuela until the government changes. But eventually, there’s going to be a government, whether it’s next month or next year or next decade, that’s more friendly to the United States, and the United States will pressure that government to hand over the suspects.

Numerous times throughout the indictment, the DOJ references that the alleged crimes were committed as far back as 1999. Is there a statute of limitations the U.S. government has to work within? What should we make of this?

I noticed that, but the answer is not particularly anything to note, for two reasons. One is they’re going to argue that it’s an ongoing conspiracy. And second, even if they were unsuccessful in arguing that, they still have enough overt acts of the conspiracy within the statute limitation over the last five or six years.

What strategy do you think the prosecution will take and how do you expect the Maduros to defend themselves?

The latter is slightly more interesting, which is clearly the Maduros will argue that he should receive head-of-state immunity. They might argue that he was illegally kidnapped from Venezuela, but that’s a loser argument because the Supreme Court has been very clear since at least 1886. There is a case called Ker v. Illinois where the defendant was forcibly kidnapped from Peru and brought out to a U.S. Navy ship and then brought back to the United States for prosecution—sounds kind of familiar. The Supreme Court basically said that they’re not going to concern themselves with how the defendant reached the United States’ shores; as long as they’re here, they can be prosecuted. This Supreme Court has reaffirmed that time and time again. So can Maduro make that argument? Sure, but it’s going to lose. I think that he’ll have stronger grounds for making the head-of-state immunity argument, which is interesting when you consider ultimately how far can that argument take you. I guess to the Supreme Court, but what’s this conservative Supreme Court going to do with that? I wouldn’t expect great results for Maduro on that.

I think his best possible strategy is to challenge the evidence at trial. You’ve got to wonder; putting together a criminal drug-trafficking conspiracy case in Venezuela is a technically hard case to put together. They’ve got one cooperator, but you can cross-examine the cooperator, who’s cooperating in hopes of a more lenient sentence. Sounds like the prosecution has some recordings, and you can guess that they probably have some electronic intercepts, but my guess is that kind of old-fashioned trial defense is going to be their strategy here. Now, the prosecution strategy is the converse of that, which is roll up your sleeves and put on the evidence in the way that you would with any other drug conspiracy.

What happens next? How quickly do you foresee this case moving forward?

Not that long, although it depends a whole heck of a lot on how much evidence the government has collected. You’ll start to see that on the docket as the government makes disclosures of evidence to the defendants, known as discovery disclosures. There are cases where there are millions of pages and the defendant needs significant time to review millions of pages of emails, text messages, and listen to hundreds of hours of wiretaps. I suspect that this case is going to be light on paper, emails, and text messages, and my guess is there are not a ton of recordings, because it’s a bit more technologically challenging to get recordings in the room in drug deals in Venezuela. I think that this could be a case with relatively light evidence discovery, in which case you might see this go to trial within a year or so.

South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham has a hard-earned skip in his step. After nearly a decade of obsequious, showy servility to the president he once warned would be the death knell of the Republican Party, Graham is getting what he wants: an interventionist Republican president merrily drawing up a list of baddies to take down, starting with captured Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro.

Graham was one of the first to recognize, long ago, that Donald Trump’s policy views are determined mostly by the flattery of the last person to speak with him before a decision. For both of Trump’s presidencies, Graham has worked to flatter Trump at every turn, and to be the final person to do so. While Graham has his hands in a lot of policy jars, his passion is an interventionist foreign policy. That’s led to an ever-running proxy battle for Trump’s sympathies between himself and an ascendant noninterventionist “America First” foreign policy wing, as best represented in the Senate by Kentucky’s Rand Paul.

Graham couldn’t contain his glee on Sunday aboard Air Force One as he stood inches from Trump, shortly after the Venezuela operation.

The president was rattling through a list of countries in the Americas that would go down next. Mexico? “You have to do something with Mexico.” What about a mission in Colombia? “It sounds good to me.” And as for the big, bad hemispheric archnemesis of 70 years Cuba: “Looks like it’s ready for fall.”

“Yes!” Graham said, beaming with the glow of someone whose life had been leading to this very moment.

Aboard Air Force One, in his own remarks—which the president frequently interrupted with stray thoughts about how, for example, he would’ve taken out bin Laden before 9/11—Graham laid it on extra thick.

“We had Venezuela, we have Cuba, we have Colombia in our backyard. And these three countries have been condemned ever since I’ve been in politics,” Graham said. “Joe Biden put a $25 million bounty on Maduro’s head.” And “this commander in chief,” he added, “he did something people talked about doing.”

Graham isn’t just thinking about the “backyard” (a whole hemisphere), though. Also on Sunday—the senator was everywhere on Sunday—he appeared on Fox News with a message for another, more distant regime that he has long believed in changing. And he brought a prop.

“I pray and hope that 2026 will be”—here he paused to put on a baseball cap bearing the slogan he would then utter—“the year that we make Iran great again.”

Graham has been waiting for a moment like this for a while, ever since the failures of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars soured the public on the wisdom of nation-building. For a long time, Graham hitched his wagon to the celebrity of his friend and fellow hawk John McCain. Since McCain’s death, and with the rise of an isolationist element in the MAGA movement, Graham has been trying to work Trump in his direction. The kidnapping of one hostile foreign leader is, for Graham, a good start.

But not all is joyous in the Senate Republican conference. Just as much as Graham might sound as if he’s won the long fight for Trump’s foreign-policy orientation, Rand Paul is sounding as if he’s lost.

Paul reflected on Trump’s tenure Monday, speaking with reporters.

“Whenever I had misgivings about something else, I’d always come back and say, ‘Well, he’s the best we’ve ever had,’ much better than the Bushes, who were war-mad and wanted to be involved in all these crazy wars overseas and were going to make the world safe for democracy—I never liked any of that,” he said. “And I thought Trump was different. And so it disappoints me that he’s under the thrall of Lindsey Graham.

“There should be a law,” Paul continued, “that Lindsey Graham can only go to the White House every other week.”

How much credit does Graham give himself for persuading Trump to move in a more interventionist direction? I asked Graham this on Tuesday. He was smart enough not to bite, awarding credit for all critical thinking to the president.

“I’m just reinforcing what he told me in January 2025,” he said. “I had a talk with him. We have a drug caliphate in our backyard—look at it as a caliphate. Instead of complaining about it, let’s get rid of it. These are not, you know, unbeatable foes. And I think the American people would appreciate somebody finally stopping those who are poisoning Americans and making billions of dollars.” (Also: Get rid of Iran.)

Both Graham and Paul had throngs of reporters following them in the Capitol Tuesday, getting their sides of the long-running foreign-policy feud that had now swung dramatically in one direction. Paul was talking on the level of legality, and about how the administration’s arguments that Maduro’s capture was a law-enforcement operation, and thus not a military operation requiring congressional input, made no sense.

“If you say that we don’t have to declare war because this is a criminal” case, he told reporters, “it would basically be an argument you could go to any country where you had a beef, that you could get an indictment for them” and run a military operation to decapitate the state.

Rand Paul might have the law, but Lindsey Graham has Trump. I asked Graham if he felt that he had won the battle against Paul in favor of interventionism. Graham took issue with the term itself.

“This is not intervention,” he said. “This is protecting America. It’s not like ‘Hey, what are you doing today? Let’s go to Venezuela. Seems like nice beaches, good-looking people. Let’s take it.’ This is protecting America from threat.”

“Rand Paul”—he paused for a second and ever so slightly rolled his eyes, considering his words—“doesn’t believe that radical Islam is a threat. He would withdraw, he’d be America Fortress, America Fortress. There’d be no troops anywhere. Trump wants to protect the country.

“America First,” he summed it up, “is taking countries that hurt America and change them. Interventionism is going somewhere without a real good reason.”

That’s his story, and he’s sticking to it.

Since the demise of Roe v. Wade, red-state lawmakers have been looking for political cover for unpopular criminal abortion bans, and a simple strategy has emerged: stressing that bans in theory afford access in exceptional cases that voters overwhelmingly support, such as medical emergencies. The goal of this maneuver is straightforward. For voters who are conflicted about abortion, a focus on exceptions makes bans moderate and reasonable. But a major decision on Tuesday by the Wyoming Supreme Court striking down the state’s abortion ban suggests that abortion exceptions are fast becoming a Catch-22 for the GOP—a potential political lifeline that can create real trouble in court.

To appreciate why abortion exceptions can create legal headaches for Republicans, it helps to understand the Wyoming litigation. A group of patients, doctors, and advocates challenged the constitutionality of the state’s abortion bans under Article 1, Section 38 of the Wyoming Constitution, passed as part of the backlash to President Barack Obama’s Affordable Care Act. The amendment recognizes a right to make health care decisions. The plaintiffs argued that this right was fundamental and encompassed people’s decision to terminate a pregnancy. The state responded that abortion wasn’t health care—it was the intentional taking of human life—and that even if abortion were health care, the state’s interest in protecting prenatal life was enough to justify its ban. This focus on protecting life made strategic sense; all five justices on the Wyoming Supreme Court were appointed by Republicans, and polls suggest that even Americans who support legal abortion think fetal life has value, despite their opposition to the sweeping criminalization of decisions about pregnancy.

That’s where the plaintiffs pointed to the state law’s abortion exceptions: If the state really valued protecting fetal life, and if abortion wasn’t health care, the plaintiffs argued, these specific exceptions were a funny way of showing it.

Take the state’s exceptions for fatal fetal abnormalities, which apply only if a physician expects that a newborn’s death will occur within days of a live birth. The court asked how this exception made any sense. How did the state protect life by making women in other cases when death of the newborn was just as certain—but who had a longer timeline to sit with that doomed outcome—carry their pregnancies to term? Given that pregnancy could pose risks to abortion seekers, the justices thought the fetal-abnormality exception threatened patients’ health without advancing the state’s supposed goals.

The same was true of Wyoming’s exceptions for medical emergencies, which explicitly excluded mental health crises, such as depression or psychosis, during pregnancy. The state presented no evidence that mental health wasn’t an issue during pregnancy—and no wonder: Mental health conditions accompany a significant number of pregnancies and can lead to seriously adverse outcomes.

Even the state’s rape and incest exception was a problem. The court’s justices didn’t see any connection between the state’s supposed goal of protecting all life in the womb and allowing abortions in cases of sexual abuse, and neither should anyone else. If the state believes that life or even rights begin at fertilization, it’s hard to comprehend why that wouldn’t be true in instances of sexual assault too.

That Wyoming’s abortion exceptions were weird and incoherent shouldn’t be a great surprise. In recent years, any abortion-ban exception reflects an inherently odd compromise between the demands of anti-abortion lobbyists and the electoral needs of GOP lawmakers. Republicans want to win election. That requires keeping a lid on the most heartbreaking stories, narratives that can shape the vote well outside the state where a tragedy has occurred. Abortion opponents want as many abortions as possible stopped, with the exception of a vanishingly small number of serious threats to life.

Conservative lawmakers thus propose exceptions to make abortion bans seem less harsh. Exceptions, ultimately, are a mere messaging strategy, one that undermines the legal case for abortion bans.

That’s reflected in the oddball design of many exceptions. Medical-emergency exceptions, for example, are meant not so much to give physicians real discretion in addressing urgent conditions as to rule out certain cases (such as threats to mental health) that abortion foes dismiss as “abortion on demand.” Rape-and-incest exceptions, like Wyoming’s, often contain reporting requirements intended to ferret out patients who “cry rape,” a solution in search of a problem in a culture in which sexual violence is massively underreported and rarely prosecuted. In a big-picture sense, exceptions are intended to broadcast that abortion bans are far less harsh than they appear, but on closer examination, they’re designed as much to reassure conservative lawmakers that people won’t be able to get abortions anyway.

And exceptions don’t work—by design. Historically, very few patients have sought out abortions under exceptions. That trend has continued—so much so that red states like Texas and Kentucky have passed laws said to clarify that some abortions are justified under state law. That state of affairs suits conservative lawmakers, who seek the political benefits of exceptions with none of the real abortion access they might afford.

The Wyoming Supreme Court’s ruling in State v. Johnson sends a message that this have-it-both-ways strategy on exceptions won’t always work as Republicans expect. The court saw the very same inconsistencies of exceptions as a sign that they didn’t deliver on the state’s purported goals.

It’s not clear what will come next in fights about abortion exceptions. More challenges like Johnson might come before state supreme courts, given that a number of conservative states, including Oklahoma, Ohio, Alabama, and Florida, have similar health amendments in their constitutions. But Republicans are doubling down on exceptions as a strategy: In Missouri, for example, voters will decide on whether to repeal a reproductive rights amendment passed in 2024. GOP lawmakers have tried to package the repeal amendment as allowing abortion in exceptional cases, like medical emergencies.

Republicans may think this strategy is working; some polls suggest that supporters of abortion rights are less passionate about the issue than they once were. That likely has much more to do with conservatives’ struggles to enforce abortion bans—abortion seems more, not less, common in many ban states since the fall of Roe—than with exceptions. But even when voters are willing not to look hard at what an exception really says and does, the Wyoming decision shows that the same might not be true of courts.

The Trump administration’s justifications for bombing Venezuela and arresting its president shifted in real time this weekend. Was this a national security–related counternarcotics operation, an oil heist, or a regime-change play to topple a dictator?

That lack of clarity—combined with the administration’s propensity to, well, tell a lot of lies—only added to the mass confusion over what’s really going on. After all, Donald Trump’s Venezuela adventure isn’t an isolated incident, and it’s best understood in proper historical context: the long tail of U.S. intervention in Latin America.

To help make sense of what just happened, and to get answers on what might happen next, I turned to Tiziano Breda. He’s a senior analyst covering Latin America and the Caribbean at ACLED, the independent conflict-monitoring organization that tracks political violence and protests worldwide. Breda has spent more than a decade studying Latin American politics and security.

In our conversation, he unpacks how this operation fits into the long arc of U.S. intervention in the region, the internal dynamics of Venezuela’s ruling “Chavista” coalition, the role of oil, and why the most dangerous consequence of this moment may not be what happens next in Caracas, but what it signals across the world. Our conversation has been edited and condensed for clarity.

Aymann Ismail: There’s so much in flux right now. What are the most important things we still don’t know about what’s happening between the United States and Venezuela?

Tiziano Breda: There are at least three variables that remain unclear. The first is how this will play out inside Venezuela now that Maduro has been removed. What has this generated within the Chavista power structure—in the government, the military, and across different sectors of society? What comes next depends on factors like whether Delcy Rodríguez [Venezuela’s acting president] can ensure continuity for the Chavistas while at the same time becoming somewhat more lenient toward U.S. interests.

The second is how this strike is being received in the United States. There has been backlash from Congress. The Trump administration has framed it as a law enforcement operation, but lawmakers say they were bypassed and are questioning the legality of the operation. The key question is how this lands with a Trump support base that is, in principle, uninterested in foreign interventions.

And third, at the international level, it’s still unclear how other major powers are interpreting this—whether they oppose it or see an opportunity. For countries like Russia and China, the question is whether this represents the loss of an ally, a precedent that could be applied in their own spheres of influence. For China in particular, it would mean not recovering the billions of dollars it still has as credit with Venezuela.

This didn’t come out of nowhere. There were months of escalating tensions. How does this moment fit into the longer U.S.–Venezuela standoff? Were you surprised when Trump announced the U.S. captured Maduro?

When Trump took office, his administration was mostly focused on immigration. Marco Rubio struggled with Richard Grenell over whose voice would be more influential in the White House on Venezuela. For the first few months Grenell seemed to have the upper hand: There were prisoner exchanges, deportation flights, Chevron’s license was renewed. But in 2025, Rubio established himself as a key strategic adviser on Venezuela. There was a noticeable shift: military buildup in the Caribbean, harsher rhetoric and labeling organized crime groups as terrorist organizations, allegations tying Maduro to some of them.

That framing was used to justify strikes against suspected drug-trafficking vessels—at least 34 so far with over 110 confirmed fatalities—not only in the Caribbean, but also in the Pacific. When that didn’t produce cracks within Maduro’s administration, we saw an escalation: oil tankers seized or chased, and a blockade on Venezuelan oil. That caused much more damage to the Maduro government’s ability to keep revenues afloat, yet there were still no cracks in Maduro’s network of alliances. So Trump was left with two options: either back down and strike some kind of deal or escalate. There had already been a CIA strike in late December, but I did not expect an operation of this kind.

The U.N. has already said this violates international law. Is there any real ambiguity here?

I’m not an expert on international law, but it’s my understanding that the U.S. does have the right to try someone in the United States for crimes that may have affected the U.S., such as drug trafficking. Thousands of drug traffickers have gone through this process. But I’m much less sure that this means the U.S. has the authority to go and extract Maduro from another country. Usually, the United States would request the extradition of a person believed to have committed a crime in the U.S. I’d say there are serious deficiencies in the legality of the operation.

The closest precedent, at least in Latin America, is the U.S. invasion of Panama in 1989, to capture and extract President Noriega on drug-trafficking charges. That operation was on a much larger scale and far more costly in terms of lives, duration, and scope. But it occurred in the context of the Cold War—a moment in history that preceded the era of multilateralism, international governance, and the development of international human rights norms. I’m concerned, seeing a return of this practice in 2026. It suggests much of what was built after that period is now unraveling, or being dismantled by the United States.

So what does the future of Venezuela look like? Rodríguez seems to be in control. Rubio is saying that she’s illegitimate. Do you see regime change on the horizon? Not in the short term, unless Rodríguez is unable to do two things. She needs to avoid taking a confrontational stance toward the United States, and instead strike deals and make concessions in the oil sector. Simultaneously, she needs to project an image of someone who remains loyal to Chavismo principles—respect for national sovereignty, resistance to excessive U.S. imperial practices, and so on. If she manages this balancing act, avoiding further U.S. strikes while preventing fractures within the Chavista ranks—both in the military and in social networks—Venezuela can stabilize in the short term. But if either of these fails, I think more violence is likely.

The United States has declared they intend to run the country. How will that complicate Rodríguez’s ability to stabilize Venezuela?

The U.S. is looking to ensure that this removal leads to more functional agreements with the Venezuelan government—guaranteeing U.S. companies can get in more freely, invest, settle, and sell all the oil they can pump. A full-fledged regime change does not seem to be the main goal of the Trump administration in the short term. They are aware that the [Venezuelan, anti-Maduro] opposition may have popular support, but they do not have the buy-in of the military in particular. Installing a government without military support would carry the risk of throwing the country into chaos.

Is there something about the way that the Venezuelan government is set up that will make it particularly challenging for Rodríguez to consolidate?

Like all governments and political forces, the Maduro government—the Chavistas—has its own internal currents and branches. Maduro, and particularly Cilia Flores, are relevant here. Their removal matters because Maduro and Cilia Flores had managed to pacify the different factions within Chavismo and build a system in which elites could extract wealth from Venezuela.

For example, the military benefited from revenues from the gold-mining sector. The security sector, some would say, participated in illegal drug trafficking, and of course benefited from oil and shipping. There was a balance, and wealth was distributed among military, economic, and political elites in a way that kept the system stable. Rodríguez may try to replicate this, but she will be dealing with a very different level of U.S. pressure than Maduro faced. There may also be Maduro loyalists who obstruct her government. So even if the overall architecture remains in place, simply replacing the person at the top will have repercussions across the entire government.

What role does oil actually play in all of this? I look at a country like Saudi Arabia and think, Wow, they got lucky they have so much oil. Why was this not necessarily possible for a place like Venezuela?

The key difference between Maduro and Chávez is that Maduro politicized the oil sector too heavily. When Chávez was in power, Venezuela benefited from a boom in energy prices in the mid-2000s. He also appointed people with technical expertise to manage the oil sector. When Maduro came to power in 2013, in a quest to consolidate his authority, he replaced almost all the Chavistas he didn’t trust—including the minister of oil—and replaced them with loyalists who lacked knowledge of the sector. That lack of understanding began to create problems with maintenance, delays, production failures, and so on.

Then you had the plummeting of oil prices about 10 years ago, which hurt Venezuela’s revenue. Even before the U.S. sanctioned the oil sector in 2019, under the first Trump administration, the sector was already collapsing due to corruption and overall mismanagement. They could still maintain significant production—almost a million barrels a day—but that was down from 3 million about 15 years earlier. With that, they had enough money to sustain the elites, but the rest of society and the broader economy collapsed. That’s why you had around 8 million Venezuelans fleeing the country, as the government itself remained intact.

Up until last week, Nicolas Maduro was challenging the United States to invade, publishing videos of his military conducting drills. I know a little bit about his background, that he was originally a bus driver. What can you tell me about his character?

The role of Cilia Flores [Maduro’s wife, who was also arrested] is often overlooked. Some people refer to her as the power in the shadows, operating behind the scenes. Maduro did not reach his position alone. Flores was a key figure in liaising with the different branches of the Chavismo project. She has been head of the National Assembly, a deputy, and a minister. Her political trajectory was similar to Maduro’s, even though it was Maduro who was appointed by Chávez as his political heir. Maduro relied heavily on Cilia Flores, who played a key role in holding his government together.

Maduro also made use of humor and self-parody as a political tactic. He presents himself as a funny, silly, good guy. He even created a cartoon version of himself called “Súper Bigote,” or “Super Mustache.” I can’t think of another leader who has leaned so heavily into laughing at himself. He uses that strategy to conceal the authoritarian nature of his government, to soften accusations of massive human rights violations, suppression of dissent, waves of political arrests, extrajudicial killings, and so on.

And then you see the images of him being detained in the United States. He has a big grin, giving two thumbs up. What explains that?

There was also an attempt to keep the character going, to play on the empathy of the audience, watching a guy who, in another context, might greet you with a thumbs-up and say “Happy New Year.” He appears certain of his innocence, as though he believes he will be released once the truth comes out. While the aim of the United States might have been to show that a man who had been in power since 2013—so for over a decade—who had seemed untouchable was being brought down to the level of a common criminal.

I haven’t seen much from inside Venezuela. How are Venezuelans reacting inside the country?

At ACLED, we have so far recorded only two protests inside Venezuela, and both were in favor of Maduro. It’s not only that there are no protests, there has also been a decrease in traffic and economic activity over the past couple of days. Inside the country, the government has imposed a state of emergency and deployed military forces to the streets, which has disincentivized mobilization. Uncertainty is also playing a key role. There have been mixed messages coming from the United States—the sidelining of María Corina Machado [prominent opposition leader and recipient of the 2025 Nobel Peace Prize], the attempt to reach an agreement with Rodríguez, who is part of the same system as Maduro, and the broader fear that if this doesn’t work out, it could trigger chaos within the Chavista ranks and lead to violence. So I think people are avoiding the public sphere.

And what about abroad? How are Venezuelans in the diaspora reacting to this?

The vast majority of Venezuelans abroad have celebrated Maduro’s removal from power, though not as many agree with the way it happened through the bombing of Caracas. Most Venezuelans who have fled the country in recent years did so either because of political persecution or because of the economic collapse caused by the Maduro administration.

It’s strange to see people celebrating the bombing of their own country.

It is. But it’s a testament to the level of discontent and anger toward an administration that has effectively dismantled the country’s economy. Twenty years ago, Venezuela was the wealthiest country in South America. Today, roughly a quarter of the population has been forced to leave because the economy collapsed. The relief—if not outright celebration—among many Venezuelans reflects that deep discontent with the Maduro administration.

How are other leaders and peoples in Latin America reacting to this?

There has been a mixed reaction. Leftist governments like Brazil, Colombia, and Mexico have strongly condemned the U.S. action. On the other hand, more right-wing governments like Argentina, Ecuador, and the newly elected president of Honduras have been more supportive, and in some cases even enthusiastic about the operation. The divisions have been quite clear along ideological lines.

For people particularly in countries that have been most affected by the influx of Venezuelan migrants and refugees—Peru, Ecuador, Colombia, and Chile—the arrival of Venezuelans has strained public resources, and in some cases it has been instrumentalized by xenophobic political figures, creating a stigma.

Maduro is widely perceived as the main cause of Venezuelan migration and is deeply unpopular. There was polling showing that, across Latin America, and particularly in the countries most affected by Venezuelan migration, many people were already in favor of major intervention in Venezuela, even before this happened.

The U.S. seems to be configuring the reasoning for capturing Maduro in real time, offering conflicting information. What do you think is really driving the U.S. here, and what’s bullshit?

There are three reasons. First, reasserting U.S. dominance in the hemisphere, especially actors seen as being in cahoots with the U.S.’s main global competitors, Russia and China. Second, widening U.S. access to energy and other resources. Venezuela is rich in gas, minerals, and gold, and expanding U.S. access to those sectors is strategically important for the American economy. Third is migration. Hundreds of thousands of Venezuelans live in the United States, and millions more across the region. By removing what is perceived to be the country’s main problem—Maduro—and projecting the image that the U.S. will now invest in Venezuela, the administration is trying to create a picture that things have improved and encourage Venezuelans living in the U.S. without legal status to return.

The BS part is drug trafficking, which is paradoxically the legal rationale being used to bring Maduro to justice. He’s being charged with drug trafficking, terrorism, and weapons offenses. But the narrative that Maduro himself is a central drug-trafficking threat—and that attacks on drug vessels or even Maduro’s trial will significantly reduce the flow of drugs to the U.S. or elsewhere—doesn’t really hold up.

This is a return to a more assertive U.S. approach toward Latin America. It’s something that had waned over the years and been replaced by a greater emphasis on regional cooperation through institutions like the Organization of American States, and by U.S. soft power projected through development projects. This attack marks a clear end to that era and a return to one in which the United States is willing to use its full power—economic, diplomatic, and military—to ensure that its preferences materialize in the region. It’s somewhat anachronistic, but it’s a renewed version of the Monroe Doctrine, which held that the U.S. has a responsibility to influence and direct political, economic, and military developments in the hemisphere, and to keep external forces from undermining its interests.

Does the speed at which Donald Trump pivoted to Greenland and Mexico reveal anything about how he might be thinking about Venezuela?

Trump may feel emboldened because it has cost the United States little in terms of human lives and equipment, which he emphasized repeatedly during his press conference on Saturday. Let’s see what the U.N. Security Council says and what comes next, but for now the international cost also appears limited. Whether more action happens in the immediate future will depend on how the situation in Venezuela unfolds. If it triggers domestic turmoil, violence between different factions of Chavismo, or broader social unrest, then it becomes less likely that this approach would be applied elsewhere. Paradoxically, if it works, there is a risk that it could be repeated in other contexts.

            <h2>SanDisk heals WD Black and Blues, rebrands beloved client SSDs</h2>
            <p><strong>The Register | 2026-01-07</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2026/01/07/sandisk_heals_wds_black_and_blues/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">WD Black and Blue SSDs are some of the most widely recognized client drives on the market, but their branding is about to disappear. Following Western Digital&#39;s flash-business spinoff, SanDisk announced it was retiring the beloved names and rebranding its NVMe lineup under the SANDISK Optimus banner.

Going forward, WD Blue drives, like the SN5100, will be sold as SanDisk Optimus drives. Meanwhile, the company&#39;s higher-end WD Black drives, like the SN7100 and SN8100, will bear the Optimus GX and GX Pro names.

Despite WD being among the oldest and most recognized names in PC storage, the rebrand was inevitable. In late 2023, Western Digital announced the spinoff of its flash memory business. WD took custody of the hard drive biz while SanDisk walked away with its NAND Flash division. The divorce was finalized in early 2025, and this week, SanDisk&#39;s lineup of WD Black and Blue SSDs took its name once again.

With that said, the WD Black and Blue brands aren&#39;t entirely dead. Western Digital continues to sell hard drives under the WD Black, Blue, Red, Purple, and Gold brands. The Register has reached out to WD for comment; we&#39;ll let you know if we hear anything back.

For those concerned, the change could affect supply; the rebrand is unlikely to change much. SanDisk was always responsible for the WD SSD line. The underlying hardware and tooling haven&#39;t changed hands. You might need to adjust your search query to target the Optimus brand if you can&#39;t find any old-stock WD Black or Blue drives at your favorite e-tailer, but for the moment, the hardware isn&#39;t changing.

While the rebrand is unlikely to impact supply, the global memory shortage certainly could. If you haven&#39;t noticed, NAND flash — the kind used in SSDs — and DRAM — found in DDR, LPDDR and GDDR systems and video memory — has skyrocketed in price over the past few months. As you might expect, AI is at least partially to blame.

According to the market watchers at TrendForce, client SSD prices could increase by more than 40 percent in the first quarter of 2026. And because SanDisk doesn&#39;t operate its own fabs — most of the memory modules are actually made by Kioxia — the company isn&#39;t immune to market forces.

In the press release announcing the rebrand, SanDisk didn&#39;t discuss its plans for the rest of its WD-branded flash products, many of which are still listed on its product pages. We&#39;ve reached out for comment, but considering the company already has SanDisk-branded equivalents to many of these products, we expect any lingering WD-branded SSDs simply won&#39;t be restocked once they&#39;re gone.

SanDisk isn&#39;t the only memory vendor to kill off a beloved storage brand in recent memory. In early December, Micron announced it was shuttering its Crucial brand of consumer memory and storage products to chase AI riches in the enterprise and datacenter. ®

            <p><strong>The Register | 2026-01-07</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2026/01/07/european_space_agency_breach_criminal_probe/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">exclusive The European Space Agency on Wednesday confirmed yet another massive security breach, and told The Register that the data thieves responsible will be subject to a criminal investigation. And this could be a biggie.

Earlier in the week, Scattered Lapsus$ Hunters told us that they gained initial access to ESA&#39;s servers back in September by exploiting a public CVE, and stole 500 GB of very sensitive data. This, we&#39;re told, includes operational procedures, spacecraft and mission details, subsystems documentation, and proprietary contractor data from ESA partners including SpaceX, Airbus Group, and Thales Alenia Space, among others.

And, according to the crims, the security hole remains open, giving them continued access to the space agency&#39;s live systems.

&quot;ESA is in the process of informing the judicial authorities having jurisdiction over this cyber incident to initiate a criminal inquiry,&quot; an ESA spokesperson said via email. The agency declined to answer The Register&#39;s specific questions about the intruders&#39; claims.

This comes about a week after ESA copped to a December security incident that saw a crim list more than 200 GB of ESA data for sale on the still-not-dead BreachForums.

According to a Shiny Lapsus$ Hunters spokesperson and sample files seen by The Register, the stolen goods appear to include both internal files and documents originating from contractors. This spans operational procedures, contingency plans, system capabilities and security protocols, spacecraft tolerances and failure modes, Earth Observation (EO) satellite constellation details, and other documents related to managing satellite orientation and position.

Contractor data allegedly exfiltrated in the breach belongs to SpaceX, Airbus Group, Thales Alenia Space, OHB System AG, EUMETSAT, Sener, Teledyne, Leonardo, Deimos Imaging, Sitael, SkyLabs, ISISPACE, and others.

Plus, the stolen files allegedly include sensitive information about various space programs and ESA missions such as Greece&#39;s national space program, ESA&#39;s Next Generation Gravity Mission, its FORUM (Far-infrared Outgoing Radiation Understanding and Monitoring) Earth Explorer Mission, and TRUTHS (Traceable Radiometry Underpinning Terrestrial- and Helio-Studies).

According to the extortionist crew, ESA has known about the breach for at least a week and also downloaded the sample data.

This is not ESA&#39;s first – or even second or third – security snafu. The space agency&#39;s incidents have been piling up since at least 2011.

In addition to the post-Christmas data dump last month, attackers hit its online store was in 2024 shortly before the holiday, with miscreants inserting a fake payment page to nab customer info belonging to users shopping for space-themed Christmas presents.

At the time, ESA said that it&#39;s not in charge of its own online store.

Additionally, a trio of ESA domains were compromised in 2015 via an SQL vulnerability, resulting in the theft and leak of information belonging to thousands of subscribers and some ESA staff.

And in 2011, someone broke into ESA&#39;s systems and then published administrator, content management, FTP login credentials, and Apache server config files online – although the agency said this didn&#39;t affect its internal networks. ®

            <h2>Stalkerware slinger pleads guilty for selling snooper software to suspicious spouses</h2>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The US government has secured a guilty plea from a stalkerware maker in federal court, marking just the second time in more than a decade that the US has managed to prosecute a consumer spyware vendor successfully.

Bryan Fleming, creator of stalkerware called pcTattletale, pled [PDF] guilty in the Southern District of California federal court on Tuesday to one count of selling software designed with the primary purpose of intercepting communications, with an interstate commerce element, in violation of federal law.

According to the plea agreement, Fleming sold the stalkerware from Michigan. In at least one instance, it was purchased by a buyer in the Southern District of California, allowing the case to be filed there. The plea agreement states that Fleming started advertising pcTattletale in 2017 &quot;to persons wanting to spy on spouses or partners without their knowledge.&quot;

Like other forms of stalkerware, which are essentially consumer-grade spyware like the type used with impunity by nation-states, pcTattletale was designed to be installed on both computers and mobile devices, delivering copies of text messages, emails, phone calls, geolocation information, and web browsing history to an online portal where buyers could monitor a target&#39;s activity without that person&#39;s knowledge.

In the case of pcTattletale, court documents indicate that the stalking was performed via video capture, with the software recording the victims&#39; every move whenever their device was unlocked.

As reported by the Detroit News in December, federal law enforcement agents with the Immigration and Customs Enforcement&#39;s Homeland Security Investigations division had been investigating Fleming since at least 2021. pcTattletale was singled out because it was specifically marketed for unlawful spying on partners and spouses, an HSI agent wrote in a search warrant affidavit for Fleming&#39;s home filed in November 2022, but not unsealed until last month.

There are a number of stalkerware companies operating in the United States, and their use has surged in recent years despite sloppy coding leading to security incidents that leaked the details of hundreds of thousands of customers, like what happened to mSpy (multiple times), Catwatchful, and - you guessed it - pcTattletale.

Fleming&#39;s company went bust in 2024 when it was hacked, leading to the exposure of 138,751 customer accounts, along with device information, IP addresses, physical addresses, phone numbers, text messages, and a good deal of victim information as well.

Fleming is due to be sentenced later this year, when he&#39;ll be facing up to 15 years in prison, a fine of $250,000, forfeiture of all property that was involved in the offense, and additional penalties.

As noted above, this is only the second time since 2014 that the US government has secured a guilty plea in a stalkerware case. In the prior instance, Hammad Akbar pled guilty to distributing stalkerware called StealthGenie.

Whether two guilty pleas in 12 years will be enough to stem the stalkerware tide is questionable, but a second case on similar grounds - selling software designed to snoop on people without their knowledge - at least suggests victims have recourse and that federal law enforcement has found a solid justification for bringing charges.

We reached out to several anti-stalkerware advocates for comment and will update this story if we hear back with their analysis. ®

            <p><strong>The Register | 2026-01-07</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2026/01/07/faa_radar_atc_deals/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The US government has announced contracts for new radar infrastructure as part of its long-running effort to replace the country&#39;s aging air traffic control system.

The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) disclosed that contracts have been signed with both Indra Group and RTX Corporation, formerly Raytheon Technologies, to deliver modern radar systems for the overhauled system.

Separately, RTX said that its subsidiary, Collins Aerospace, has secured $438 million to support the Radar System Replacement program, while Indra indicated it has been awarded $342 million to manufacture next-generation air traffic surveillance radars.

RTX already develops the AN/SPY-6 family of radar kit used by US Navy ships, and various other military radar systems.

The news follows the announcement in December that security and technology services company Peraton had been chosen as the prime integrator, with overall responsibility for building the imaginatively named Brand New Air Traffic Control System (BNATCS).

US Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy exclaimed at the time that he was &quot;thrilled&quot; to be working with Peraton because they &quot;share President Trump&#39;s drive to modernize our skies safely at record speed.&quot;

Commenting on the announcement, FAA Administrator Bryan Bedford said: &quot;Our radar network is outdated and long overdue for replacement. Many of the units have exceeded their intended service life, making them increasingly expensive to maintain and difficult to support.&quot;

The FAA expects RTX and Indra to deliver replacements for up to 612 sites by June 2028 with modern, commercially available surveillance radar sets. It claims that the first installations are scheduled to begin this quarter, and upgrades will then proceed on a rolling basis, prioritizing high-traffic areas.

As well as replacing the radar, the FAA aims to consolidate the 14 different configurations in the current National Airspace System in order to simplify maintenance and logistics.

While the US likes to claim that its air traffic system is the safest in the world, it is antiquated, with much of the infrastructure dating to the 1980s or even earlier. There were revelations last year that the system was still running with floppy disks and information on scraps of paper.

Previous attempts at an upgrade proceeded at a snail&#39;s pace, with the expectation that they would not be complete before 2030.

Last year, Duffy unveiled ambitious plans to accelerate the overhaul after a report revealed that more than a third of the air traffic control systems were in an &quot;unsustainable&quot; state.

Funding for this was approved as part of President Trump&#39;s budget bill last year, which allotted $12.5 billion for the BNATCS program. It is expected that another $20 billion will be required to finish the job.

Welcoming the move, Indra said it was fully aligned with the FAA, the US Department of Transportation, Congress, and the Trump administration in delivering a safer, more resilient, and future-ready National Airspace System.

Nate Boelkins, president of Avionics at Collins Aerospace, commented: &quot;As a trusted supplier to the FAA for more than 70 years, Collins is ready to rapidly deploy next-generation radar systems that replace outdated technology with a single, modern and interoperable solution.&quot; ®

            <div id="article-text">With less than a month to go until NASA attempts to send astronauts around the Moon, the agency is demolishing facilities that got it there the first time around.

Twenty-five structures at Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Alabama are slated for removal, with two test stands set for controlled implosion no earlier than sunrise on January 10, 2026.

Propulsion and Structural Test Facility (credit: MSFC, photographer: Fred Deaton)

The Propulsion and Structural Test Facility - also known as the T-tower - was built in 1957 by the US Army Ballistic Missile Agency and transferred to NASA in 1960. It played a role in the development of the F-1 engine, which powered the first stage of the Saturn V, as well as the S-IC itself. It was also used to test the Space Shuttle solid rocket boosters.

Also on the chopping block is the Dynamic Test Stand, which, at 360 feet, was tall enough for full-scale tests of the Saturn V rocket and was the first location where all Space Shuttle elements – the external tank, solid rocket boosters, and orbiter – were integrated.

Crews have already begun demolition of the Neutral Buoyancy Simulator – a 1960s-era underwater facility where astronauts could be dunked to simulate near-weightlessness and test hardware procedures (including those required for servicing the Hubble Space Telescope). It&#39;s long been replaced by a facility at Johnson Space Center in Houston.

All three were designated National Historic Landmarks in 1985, but maintaining them is no longer economically viable.

&quot;These structures are not safe,&quot; said acting center director Rae Ann Meyer. &quot;By removing these structures that we have not used in decades, we are saving money on upkeep of facilities we can&#39;t use.&quot;

The facilities have been documented in detail, but it&#39;s still a loss of a tangible connection to NASA&#39;s past.

NASA warned communities near Redstone Arsenal to expect a &quot;loud noise associated with the demolition on the morning of Jan. 10.&quot; ®

            <div id="article-text">Fancy having an AI system packed with Nvidia H200 GPUs that you can take with you from place to place? According to hardware maker Odinn, now you can, so long as you don&#39;t mind carrying a 77-pound (35 kg) box around.

At CES this week, Odinn is showcasing its Omnia system that combines AMD EPYC 9965 CPUs with up to four Nvidia H200 NVL GPUs and 6 TB of memory, all in a single enclosure with a 23.8-inch display – and carry handles.

This it describes as &quot;roughly the size of a carry-on suitcase,&quot; though we wouldn&#39;t like to try lifting a 77 pound weight up to an overhead locker and wedging it in, and we doubt there are many airlines that would let you.

But Odinn isn&#39;t pitching Omnia as a portable PC or even a mobile workstation. Instead, it styles the system as a portable datacenter.

&quot;As the laptop freed the desktop, Omnia frees the datacenter,&quot; its website proclaims.

This is pushing things a bit far, as most datacenters have hundreds, if not thousands, of servers in them, and any single AI server is likely to have double the maximum number of GPUs that the Omnia can have fitted.

It does, however, have built-in cooling and a redundant power supply unit (PSU) configuration with Platinum-rated units, so it is definitely workstation or server-grade hardware.

Who would want a portable datacenter, and why? Odinn lists four potential configurations of the box on its website, covering AI, Creator, Search, or Omnia X, the most powerful. The uses for these include mission-critical inferencing at the edge, film crews and postproduction houses who need a self-contained mobile workstation, military AI missions, and enterprise-grade simulations.

And there is more. The firm says that, for anyone needing even greater scale (What? More than one datacenter?), Omnia is designed to work as a building block. Multiple units can be clustered to form Infinity Racks, it claims, delivering large GPU clusters on-site.

None of this will come cheap - a single Nvidia H200 is estimated to set you back around $32,000. It&#39;s hard to imagine many companies would let employees walk out with something so valuable and easily stolen.

However, Odinn doesn&#39;t offer any hint of pricing on its website. We asked, and will update the article if it responds.

With its built-in screen and flip-down keyboard, the Omina reminds us of something from the early days of portable computing: the famous Osborne 1 or the Compaq Portable.

Neither of those weighed anything close to 77 pounds, despite containing a CRT screen, but were arm-stretching enough to be regarded as &quot;luggables&quot; rather than true portables. Perhaps the Omnia should be seen as the successor to these – only much, much more powerful. ®

I’m all for not burning my hair to a crisp.

Hair gadgets have become increasingly popular over the last decade. Hair dryers, curlers, steamers — you name it, there’s probably a TikTokker shilling for the latest hair gadget that will totally revolutionize a hair routine. Even so, I was excited to get a demo of L’Oréal’s Light Straight at CES 2026.

It’s an extension of the tech that L’Oréal introduced at CES 2024 with the Airlight Pro hairdryer. In a nutshell, most conventional hair styling tools rely on heated coils and motors. The Airlight Pro hairdryer introduced infrared light to help speed up drying while reducing the overall heat required. (I’ve been doing some long-term testing of the high-tech hair dryer versus a standard one over the past year, and I can confirm that it is much faster.)

The Light Straight uses the same tech, but in a flat iron form. The proposed benefit is the ability to straighten or curl hair with one pass, using less heat. Typical hair styling tools can exceed 400 degrees Fahrenheit, but the Light Straight won’t go beyond 320 degrees. Altogether, the company says that should translate to three times faster styling and hair that’s two times smoother. Considering that styling can take forever — and lead to some crispy strands — saving time while also reducing damage is a compelling pitch.

I didn’t get to try it on my own hair for hygienic reasons. I did, however, get to handle the device and see a robot arm curl and straighten a test strand of hair. The flat iron is relatively lightweight to hold and heats up quickly. In the demo, I was able to see the robot curl and then straighten hair with a single pass — but the resulting hair wasn’t too hot to the touch. It was an impressive demo, though we’ll have to see how the device performs on different hair types. L’Oréal told me that the device should work on most hair types, but it’s not going to change the fact that flat irons are easier to use on certain hair types over others.

The Light Straight is slated to arrive sometime in 2027, so we don’t yet know how much it’ll cost. Further down the line, L’Oréal says it’s keen to expand this infrared light tech to multi-styler tools like hairdryer/roller brush combos.

Feel free to surprise us, Samsung, but this BB-8-like rolling robot buddy is a CES ghost story.

Samsung’s spherical Ballie robot may be rolling off into the sunset, less than a year after its retail launch was announced. The smart home robot has made an appearance at CES almost every year since it was first announced in 2020, but was notably absent at CES 2026. Unfortunately, its disappearance may be because Ballie has been shelved.

In a statement emailed to Bloomberg, Samsung said Ballie is an “active innovation platform,” and “continues to inform how Samsung designs spatially aware, context-driven experiences, particularly in areas like smart home intelligence, ambient AI and privacy-by-design.”

However, there was no mention of the robot’s consumer release. There was a flood of AI robots at CES this year, like Samsung rival LG’s CLOiD robot. Ballie, a bright yellow soccer ball-size robot with a built-in projector and Google Gemini, would have fit right in, but it seems like Samsung probably isn’t releasing the BB-8 look-a-like after all.

But it’s ‘not intended for diagnosis or treatment.’

OpenAI has been dropping hints this week about AI’s role as a “healthcare ally” — and today, the company is announcing a product to go along with that idea: ChatGPT Health.

ChatGPT Health is a sandboxed tab within ChatGPT that’s designed for users to ask their health-related questions in what it describes as a more secure and personalized environment, with a separate chat history and memory feature than the rest of ChatGPT. The company is encouraging users to connect their personal medical records and wellness apps, such as Apple Health, Peloton, MyFitnessPal, Weight Watchers, and Function, “to get more personalized, grounded responses to their questions.” It suggests connecting medical records so that ChatGPT can analyze lab results, visit summaries, and clinical history; MyFitnessPal and Weight Watchers for food guidance; Apple Health for health and fitness data, including “movement, sleep, and activity patterns”; and Function for insights into lab tests.

On the medical records front, OpenAI says it’s partnered with b.well, which will provide back-end integration for users to upload their medical records, since the company works with about 2.2 million providers. For now, ChatGPT Health requires users to sign up for a waitlist to request access, as it’s starting with a beta group of early users, but the product will roll out gradually to all users regardless of subscription tier.

The company makes sure to mention in the blog post that ChatGPT Health is “not intended for diagnosis or treatment,” but it can’t fully control how people end up using AI when they leave the chat. By the company’s own admission, in underserved rural communities, users send nearly 600,000 healthcare-related messages weekly, on average, and seven in 10 healthcare conversations in ChatGPT “happen outside of normal clinic hours.” In August, physicians published a report on a case of a man being hospitalized for weeks with an 18th-century medical condition after taking ChatGPT’s alleged advice to replace salt in his diet with sodium bromide. Google’s AI Overview made headlines for weeks after its launch over dangerous advice, such as putting glue on pizza, and a recent investigation by The Guardian found that dangerous health advice has continued, with false advice for liver function tests, women’s cancer tests, and recommended diets for those with pancreatic cancer.

In a blog post, OpenAI wrote that based on its “de-identified analysis of conversations,” more than 230 million people around the world already ask ChatGPT questions related to health and wellness each week. OpenAI also said that over the past two years, it’s worked with more than 260 physicians to provide feedback on model outputs more than 600,000 times over 30 areas of focus, to help shape the product’s responses.

“ChatGPT can help you understand recent test results, prepare for appointments with your doctor, get advice on how to approach your diet and workout routine, or understand the tradeoffs of different insurance options based on your healthcare patterns,” OpenAI claims in the blog post.

One part of health that OpenAI seemed to carefully avoid mentioning in its blog post: mental health. There are a number of examples of adults or minors dying by suicide after confiding in ChatGPT, and in the blog post, OpenAI stuck to a vague mention that users can customize instructions in the Health product “to avoid mentioning sensitive topics.” When asked during a Wednesday briefing with reporters whether ChatGPT Health would also summarize mental health visits and provide advice in that realm, OpenAI’s CEO of applications, Fidji Simo, said, “Mental health is certainly part of health in general, and we see a lot of people turning to ChatGPT for mental health conversations,” adding that the new product “can handle any part of your health including mental health … We are very focused on making sure that in situations of distress we respond accordingly and we direct toward health professionals,” as well as loved ones or other resources.

It’s also possible that the product could worsen health anxiety conditions, such as hypochondria. When asked whether OpenAI had introduced any safeguards to help prevent people with such conditions from spiraling while using ChatGPT Health, Simo said, “We have done a lot of work on tuning the model to make sure that we are informative without ever being alarmist and that if there is action to be taken we direct to the healthcare system.”

When it comes to security concerns, OpenAI says that ChatGPT Health “operates as a separate space with enhanced privacy to protect sensitive data” and that the company introduced several layers of purpose-built encryption (but not end-to-end encryption), according to the briefing. Conversations within the Health product aren’t used to train its foundation models, by default, and if a user begins a health-related conversation in regular ChatGPT, the chatbot will suggest moving it into the Health product for “additional protections,” per the blog post. But OpenAI has had security breaches in the past, most notably a March 2023 issue that allowed some users to see chat titles, initial messages, names, email addresses, and payment information from other users. In the event of a court order, OpenAI would still need to provide access to the data “where required through valid legal processes or in an emergency situation,” OpenAI head of health Nate Gross said during the briefing.

When asked if ChatGPT Health is compliant with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), Gross said that “in the case of consumer products, HIPAA doesn’t apply in this setting — it applies toward clinical or professional healthcare settings.”

The smart shopping cart adds a more responsive scanner that’s easier to spot.

Amazon is launching a revamped version of its smart shopping cart, which it plans to bring to dozens of Whole Foods locations by the end of this year, according to an announcement on Wednesday. The new Dash Cart features a “more responsive” item scanner that’s now located next to the built-in display, along with a new NFC reader that lets you tap to pay with your credit card or phone.

Amazon’s previous Dash Cart design put scanners beneath and in front of the handle, potentially making them harder to spot. It also only let you pay with the credit card attached to your Amazon account.

With the upgraded Dash Cart, you’ll find a new scale alongside the cart’s handle, which Amazon says “works in tandem with on-cart cameras, weight sensors, and deep learning models to ensure accurate pricing for every item.” The upgraded Dash Cart eliminates the large sensors facing inside the cart as well, offering a 40 percent larger capacity and a 25 percent lighter weight.

The Dash Cart shows an interactive map of the store on its display, similar to Instacart’s smart Caper Cart. You can sync your shopping list created with Alexa, too, and see how much you’re spending as you add more items to your cart. The cart uses built-in sensors and computer vision to detect when you’ve removed an item, allowing it to automatically update your total. When you’re done shopping, you can skip the checkout line and leave the store in a designated Dash Cart lane.

Amazon is launching its new Dash Cart as the company shakes up its grocery business, which has tied Whole Foods more closely to the Amazon brand. The company has already brought its new Dash Cart to three Whole Foods stores in McKinney, Texas; Reston, Virginia; and Westford, Massachusetts, along with two Amazon Fresh stores.

﻿The Instax Mini Evo Cinema can capture 15-second video clips and print your favorite moments as tiny movie posters.

Fujifilm is expanding its hybrid instant camera line with the new Instax Mini Evo Cinema that adds the ability to capture video clips up to 15 seconds long. The Mini Evo Cinema also features a unique design inspired by the vintage Fujica Single-8 8mm film camera that Fujifilm introduced in 1965. It will be released in Japan on January 30th, 2026, but pricing, and wider availability, haven’t been announced yet.

The Mini Evo Cinema’s functionality is similar to Fujifilm’s other Instax cameras. You can still use it to take photos, and it doubles as a wireless printer for images snapped on your smartphone. But instant prints now pop out of the top of the camera, and its multifunction shutter button is positioned below its lens. A single press snaps a photo, while holding the shutter button captures video until you release it.

On the side of the camera is a dial that simplifies selecting video effects. Fujifilm calls it the Eras Dial because its 10 different effects are organized into 10 different decades dating from 1930 to 2020. Selecting 1960 applies an effect making your footage look like it was captured by an 8mm film camera, for example, while 1970 evokes the look of older CRT color TVs. The effects also add “distinctive sound characteristics” to the audio you capture, and some of them will even play sound effects like a mechanical film shutter while you record.

You can share your videos to social media using Fujifilm’s Instax Mini Evo mobile app, but you can also print out still frames (with cute movie poster-inspired enhancements) embedded with a QR code that others can use to access the clip online. You’ll need to upload the video to Fujifilm’s servers through the app first, which will store and keep them accessible for up to two years without any additional fees.

The holidays — and the copious amounts of binge-watching that come with them — are very much behind us at this point, but that doesn’t mean there won’t be time to catch up on the movies from last year (and beyond) you might have missed. Thankfully, Amazon has brought back one of the better promos we’ve seen in recent years, allowing you to snag three 4K UHD Blu-ray discs for $33 through January 19th.

It should go without saying that you’ll need a 4K Blu-ray player like Panasonic’s UB820-K or step-down DP-UB420-K to take full advantage of the discs; however, a disc-based Xbox Series X or PS5 will also work just fine, even if they’re not quite as capable when it comes to features as a dedicated option. As for the promo, Amazon’s discounted catalog includes more than 150 Blu-ray titles, including newer films like F1 The Movie, Wicked, and James Gunn’s latest Superman entry. You can also save on an expansive list of older films, from Inception to classics like 2001: A Space Odyssey, all available for $11 at checkout (as long as you buy three).

            <h2>Deploying a hybrid approach to Web3 in the AI era</h2>
            <p><strong>MIT Technology Review | 2026-01-07</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2026/01/07/1129490/deploying-a-hybrid-approach-to-web3-in-the-ai-era/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">When the concept of “Web 3.0” first emerged about a decade ago the idea was clear: Create a more user-controlled internet that lets you do everything you can now, except without servers or intermediaries to manage the flow of information.

Where Web2, which emerged in the early 2000s, relies on centralized systems to store data and supply compute, all owned—and monetized by—a handful of global conglomerates, Web3 turns that structure on its head. Instead, data and compute are decentralized through technologies like blockchain and peer-to-peer networks.

What was once a futuristic concept is quickly becoming a more concrete reality, even at a time when Web2 still dominates. Six out of ten Fortune 500 companies are exploring blockchain-based solutions, most taking a hybrid approach that combines traditional Web2 business models and infrastructure with the decentralized technologies and principles of Web3.

Popular use cases include cloud services, supply chain management, and, most notably financial services. In fact, at one point, the daily volume of transactions processed on decentralized finance exchanges exceeded $10 billion.

Among the advantages of Web3 for the enterprise are greater ownership and control of sensitive data, says Erman Tjiputra, founder and CEO of the AIOZ Network, which is building infrastructure for Web3, powered by decentralized physical infrastructure networks (DePIN), blockchain-based systems that govern physical infrastructure assets.

More cost-effective compute is another benefit, as is enhanced security and privacy as the cyberattack landscape grows more hostile, he adds. And it could even help protect companies from outages caused by a single point of failure, which can lead to downtime, data loss, and revenue deficits.

But perhaps the most exciting opportunity, says Tjiputra, is the ability to build and scale AI reliably and affordably. By leveraging a people-powered internet infrastructure, companies can far more easily access—and contribute to—shared resource like bandwidth, storage, and processing power to run AI inference, train models, and store data. All while using familiar developer tooling and open, usage-based incentives.

“We’re in a compute crunch where requirements are insatiable, and Web3 creates this ability to benefit while contributing,” explains Tjiputra.

In 2025, AIOZ Network launched a distributed compute platform and marketplace where developers and enterprises can access and monetize AI assets, and run AI inference or training on AIOZ Network’s more than 300,000 contributing devices. The model allows companies to move away from opaque datasets and models and scale flexibly, without centralized lock in.

Despite the promise, it is still early days for Web3, and core systemic challenges are leaving senior leadership and developers hesitant about its applicability at scale.

One hurdle is a lack of interoperability. The current fragmentation of blockchain networks creates a segregated ecosystem that makes it challenging to transfer assets or data between platforms. This often complicates transactions and introduces new security risks due to the reliance on mechanisms such as cross-chain bridges. These are tools that allow asset transfers between platforms but which have been shown to be vulnerable to targeted attacks.

“We have countless blockchains running on different protocols and consensus models,” says Tjiputra. “These blockchains need to work with each other so applications can communicate regardless of which chain they are on. This makes interoperability fundamental.”

Regulatory uncertainty is also a challenge. Outdated legal frameworks can sit at odds with decentralized infrastructures, especially when it comes to compliance with data protection and anti-money laundering regulations.

“Enterprises care about verifiability and compliance as much as innovation, so we need frameworks where on-chain transparency strengthens accountability instead of adding friction,” Tjiputra says.

And this is compounded by user experience (UX) challenges, says Tjiputra. “The biggest setback in Web3 today is UX,” he says. “For example, in Web2, if I forget my bank username or password, I can still contact the bank, log in and access my assets. The trade-off in Web3 is that, should that key be compromised or lost, we lose access to those assets. So, key recovery is a real problem.”

Although such systemic challenges won’t be solved overnight, by leveraging DePIN networks, enterprises can bridge the gap between Web2 and Web3, without making a wholesale switch. This can minimize risk while harnessing much of the potential.

AIOZ Network’s own ecosystem includes capacity for media streaming, AI compute, and distributed storage that can be plugged into an existing Web2 tech stack. “You don’t need to go full Web3,” says Tjiputra. “You can start by plugging distributed storage into your workflow, test it, measure it, and see the benefits firsthand.”

The AIOZ Storage solution, for example, offers scalable distributed object storage by leveraging the global network of contributor devices on AIOZ DePIN. It is also compatible with existing storage systems or commonly used web application programming interfaces (APIs).

“Say we have a programmer or developer who uses Amazon S3 Storage or REST APIs, then all they need to do is just repoint the endpoints,” explains Tjiputra. “That&#39;s it. It’s the same tools, it&#39;s really simple. Even with media, with a single one-stop shop, developers can do transcoding and streaming with a simple REST API.”

Built on Cosmos, a network of hundreds of different blockchains that can communicate with each other, and a standardized framework enabled by Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), AIOZ Network has also prioritized interoperability. “Applications shouldn’t care which chain they’re on. Developers should target APIs without worrying about consensus mechanisms. That’s why we built on Cosmos and EVM—interoperability first.”

This hybrid model, which allows enterprises to use both Web2 and Web3 advantages in tandem, underpins what Tjiputra sees as the longer-term ambition for the much-hyped next iteration of the internet.

“Our vision is a truly peer-to-peer foundation for a people-powered internet, one that minimizes single points of failure through multi-region, multi-operator design,” says Tjiputra. “By distributing compute and storage across contributors, we gain both cost efficiency and end-to-end security by default.

“Ideally, we want to evolve the internet toward a more people-powered model, but we’re not there yet. We’re still at the starting point and growing.”

Indeed, Web3 isn’t quite snapping at the heels of the world’s Web2 giants, but its commercial advantages in an era of AI have become much harder to ignore. And with DePIN bridging the gap, enterprises and developers can step into that potential while keeping one foot on surer ground.

Europe’s drone-filled vision for the future of war

Last spring, 3,000 British soldiers deployed an invisible automated intelligence network, known as a “digital targeting web,” as part of a NATO exercise called Hedgehog in the damp forests of Estonia’s eastern territories.The system had been cobbled together over the course of four months—an astonishing pace for weapons development, which is usually measured in years. Its purpose is to connect everything that looks for targets—“sensors,” in military lingo—and everything that fires on them (“shooters”) to a single, shared wireless electronic brain.Eighty years after total war last transformed the continent, the Hedgehog tests signal a brutal new calculus of European defense. But leaning too much on this new mathematics of warfare could be a risky bet. Read the full story.

MIT Technology Review Narrated: How one controversial startup hopes to cool the planet

Stardust Solutions believes that it can solve climate change—for a price.The Israel-based geoengineering startup has said it expects nations will soon pay it more than a billion dollars a year to launch specially equipped aircraft into the stratosphere. Once they’ve reached the necessary altitude, those planes will disperse particles engineered to reflect away enough sunlight to cool down the planet, purportedly without causing environmental side effects.

But numerous solar geoengineering researchers are skeptical that Stardust will line up the customers it needs to carry out a global deployment in the next decade. They’re also highly critical of the idea of a private company setting the global temperature for us.

“I want to keep up with the latest doom.”

—Author Margaret Atwood explains why she doomscrolls to Wired.

Inside the decades-long fight over Yahoo’s misdeeds in ChinaWhen you think of Big Tech these days, Yahoo is probably not top of mind. But for Chinese dissident Xu Wanping, the company still looms large—and has for nearly two decades.In 2005, Xu was arrested for signing online petitions relating to anti-Japanese protests. He didn’t use his real name, but he did use his Yahoo email address. Yahoo China violated its users’ trust—providing information on certain email accounts to Chinese law enforcement, which in turn allowed the government to identify and arrest some users.Xu was one of them; he would serve nine years in prison. Now, he and five other Chinese former political prisoners are suing Yahoo and a slate of co-defendants—not because of the company’s information-sharing (which was the focus of an earlier lawsuit filed by other plaintiffs), but rather because of what came after. Read the full story.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">MIT Technology Review Explains: Let our writers untangle the complex, messy world of technology to help you understand what’s coming next. You can read more from the series here.

I am writing this because one of my editors woke up in the middle of the night and scribbled on a bedside notepad: “What is a parameter?” Unlike a lot of thoughts that hit at 4 a.m., it’s a really good question—one that goes right to the heart of how large language models work. And I’m not just saying that because he’s my boss. (Hi, Boss!)

A large language model’s parameters are often said to be the dials and levers that control how it behaves. Think of a planet-size pinball machine that sends its balls pinging from one end to the other via billions of paddles and bumpers set just so. Tweak those settings and the balls will behave in a different way.

OpenAI’s GPT-3, released in 2020, had 175 billion parameters. Google DeepMind’s latest LLM, Gemini 3, may have at least a trillion—some think it’s probably more like 7 trillion—but the company isn’t saying. (With competition now fierce, AI firms no longer share information about how their models are built.)

But the basics of what parameters are and how they make LLMs do the remarkable things that they do are the same across different models. Ever wondered what makes an LLM really tick—what’s behind the colorful pinball-machine metaphors? Let’s dive in.

Think back to middle school algebra, like 2a + b. Those letters are parameters: Assign them values and you get a result. In math or coding, parameters are used to set limits or determine output. The parameters inside LLMs work in a similar way, just on a mind-boggling scale.

Short answer: an algorithm. When a model is trained, each parameter is set to a random value. The training process then involves an iterative series of calculations (known as training steps) that update those values. In the early stages of training, a model will make errors. The training algorithm looks at each error and goes back through the model, tweaking the value of each of the model’s many parameters so that next time that error is smaller. This happens over and over again until the model behaves in the way its makers want it to. At that point, training stops and the values of the model’s parameters are fixed.

In theory! In practice, because LLMs are trained on so much data and contain so many parameters, training them requires a huge number of steps and an eye-watering amount of computation. During training, the 175 billion parameters inside a medium-size LLM like GPT-3 will each get updated tens of thousands of times. In total, that adds up to quadrillions (a number with 15 zeros) of individual calculations. That’s why training an LLM takes so much energy. We’re talking about thousands of specialized high-speed computers running nonstop for months.

There are three different types of parameters inside an LLM that get their values assigned through training: embeddings, weights, and biases. Let’s take each of those in turn.

An embedding is the mathematical representation of a word (or part of a word, known as a token) in an LLM’s vocabulary. An LLM’s vocabulary, which might contain up to a few hundred thousand unique tokens, is set by its designers before training starts. But there’s no meaning attached to those words. That comes during training.

When a model is trained, each word in its vocabulary is assigned a numerical value that captures the meaning of that word in relation to all the other words, based on how the word appears in countless examples across the model’s training data.

Yeah. But there’s a bit more to it. The numerical value—the embedding—that represents each word is in fact a list of numbers, with each number in the list representing a different facet of meaning that the model has extracted from its training data. The length of this list of numbers is another thing that LLM designers can specify before an LLM is trained. A common size is 4,096.

Yup, that’s an embedding. And each of those numbers is tweaked during training. An LLM with embeddings that are 4,096 numbers long is said to have 4,096 dimensions.

It might look like a strange number. But LLMs (like anything that runs on a computer chip) work best with powers of two—2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, and so on. LLM engineers have found that 4,096 is a power of two that hits a sweet spot between capability and efficiency. Models with fewer dimensions are less capable; models with more dimensions are too expensive or slow to train and run.

Using more numbers allows the LLM to capture very fine-grained information about how a word is used in many different contexts, what subtle connotations it might have, how it relates to other words, and so on.

Back in February, OpenAI released GPT-4.5, the firm’s largest LLM yet (some estimates have put its parameter count at more than 10 trillion). Nick Ryder, a research scientist at OpenAI who worked on the model, told me at the time that bigger models can work with extra information, like emotional cues, such as when a speaker’s words signal hostility: “All of these subtle patterns that come through a human conversation—those are the bits that these larger and larger models will pick up on.”

The upshot is that all the words inside an LLM get encoded into a high-dimensional space. Picture thousands of words floating in the air around you. Words that are closer together have similar meanings. For example, “table” and “chair” will be closer to each other than they are to “astronaut,” which is close to “moon” and “Musk.” Way off in the distance you can see “prestidigitation.” It’s a little like that, but instead of being related to each other across three dimensions, the words inside an LLM are related across 4,096 dimensions.

It’s dizzying stuff. In effect, an LLM compresses the entire internet into a single monumental mathematical structure that encodes an unfathomable amount of interconnected information. It’s both why LLMs can do astonishing things and why they’re impossible to fully understand.

A weight is a parameter that represents the strength of a connection between different parts of a model—and one of the most common types of dial for tuning a model’s behavior. Weights are used when an LLM processes text.

When an LLM reads a sentence (or a book chapter), it first looks up the embeddings for all the words and then passes those embeddings through a series of neural networks, known as transformers, that are designed to process sequences of data (like text) all at once. Every word in the sentence gets processed in relation to every other word.

This is where weights come in. An embedding represents the meaning of a word without context. When a word appears in a specific sentence, transformers use weights to process the meaning of that word in that new context. (In practice, this involves multiplying each embedding by the weights for all other words.)

Biases are another type of dial that complement the effects of the weights. Weights set the thresholds at which different parts of a model fire (and thus pass data on to the next part). Biases are used to adjust those thresholds so that an embedding can trigger activity even when its value is low. (Biases are values that are added to an embedding rather than multiplied with it.)

By shifting the thresholds at which parts of a model fire, biases allow the model to pick up information that might otherwise be missed. Imagine you’re trying to hear what somebody is saying in a noisy room. Weights would amplify the loudest voices the most; biases are like a knob on a listening device that pushes quieter voices up in the mix.

Here’s the TL;DR: Weights and biases are two different ways that an LLM extracts as much information as it can out of the text it is given. And both types of parameters are adjusted over and over again during training to make sure they do this.

No, neurons are more a way to organize all this math—containers for the weights and biases, strung together by a web of pathways between them. It’s all very loosely inspired by biological neurons inside animal brains, with signals from one neuron triggering new signals from the next and so on.

Each neuron in a model holds a single bias and weights for every one of the model’s dimensions. In other words, if a model has 4,096 dimensions—and therefore its embeddings are lists of 4,096 numbers—then each of the neurons in that model will hold one bias and 4,096 weights.

Neurons are arranged in layers. In most LLMs, each neuron in one layer is connected to every neuron in the layer above. A 175-billion-parameter model like GPT-3 might have around 100 layers with a few tens of thousands of neurons in each layer. And each neuron is running tens of thousands of computations at a time.

When an LLM processes a piece of text, the numerical representation of that text—the embedding—gets passed through multiple layers of the model. In each layer, the value of the embedding (that list of 4,096 numbers) gets updated many times by a series of computations involving the model’s weights and biases (attached to the neurons) until it gets to the final layer.

The idea is that all the meaning and nuance and context of that input text is captured by the final value of the embedding after it has gone through a mind-boggling series of computations. That value is then used to calculate the next word that the LLM should spit out.

It won’t be a surprise that this is more complicated than it sounds: The model in fact calculates, for every word in its vocabulary, how likely that word is to come next and ranks the results. It then picks the top word. (Kind of. See below …)

That word is appended to the previous block of text, and the whole process repeats until the LLM calculates that the most likely next word to spit out is one that signals the end of its output.

LLM designers can also specify a handful of other parameters, known as hyperparameters. The main ones are called temperature, top-p, and top-k.

Temperature is a parameter that acts as a kind of creativity dial. It influences the model’s choice of what word comes next. I just said that the model ranks the words in its vocabulary and picks the top one. But the temperature parameter can be used to push the model to choose the most probable next word, making its output more factual and relevant, or a less probable word, making the output more surprising and less robotic.

Top-p and top-k are two more dials that control the model’s choice of next words. They are settings that force the model to pick a word at random from a pool of most probable words instead of the top word. These parameters affect how the model comes across—quirky and creative versus trustworthy and dull.

That’s one of the hottest questions in AI right now. There are a lot of different ways it can happen. Researchers have found that the amount of training data makes a huge difference. First you need to make sure the model sees enough data: An LLM trained on too little text won’t make the most of all its parameters, and a smaller model trained on the same amount of data could outperform it.

Another trick researchers have hit on is overtraining. Showing models far more data than previously thought necessary seems to make them perform better. The result is that a small model trained on a lot of data can outperform a larger model trained on less data. Take Meta’s Llama LLMs. The 70-billion-parameter Llama 2 was trained on around 2 trillion words of text; the 8-billion-parameter Llama 3 was trained on around 15 trillion words of text. The far smaller Llama 3 is the better model.

A third technique, known as distillation, uses a larger model to train a smaller one. The smaller model is trained not only on the raw training data but also on the outputs of the larger model’s internal computations. The idea is that the hard-won lessons encoded in the parameters of the larger model trickle down into the parameters of the smaller model, giving it a boost.

In fact, the days of single monolithic models may be over. Even the largest models on the market, like OpenAI’s GPT-5 and Google DeepMind’s Gemini 3, can be thought of as several small models in a trench coat. Using a technique called “mixture of experts,” large models can turn on just the parts of themselves (the “experts”) that are required to process a specific piece of text. This combines the abilities of a large model with the speed and lower power consumption of a small one.

But that’s not the end of it. Researchers are still figuring out ways to get the most out of a model’s parameters. As the gains from straight-up scaling tail off, jacking up the number of parameters no longer seems to make the difference it once did. It’s not so much how many you have, but what you do with them.

You want to see a parameter? Knock yourself out: Here&#39;s an embedding.

The experimental model won&#39;t compete with the biggest and best, but it could tell us why they behave in weird ways—and how trustworthy they really are.

Four ways to think about this year&#39;s reckoning.

They managed to cut the size of the AI reasoning model by more than half—and claim it can now answer politically sensitive questions once off limits in Chinese AI systems.

The model is built to detect when crimes are being “contemplated.”

            <p><strong>MIT Technology Review | 2026-01-07</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2026/01/07/1129748/aadhaar-nandan-nilekani-india-digital-biometric-identity-data/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Nandan Nilekani can’t stop trying to push India into the future. He started nearly 30 years ago, masterminding an ongoing experiment in technological state capacity that started with Aadhaar—the world’s largest digital identity system. Aadhaar means “foundation” in Hindi, and on that bedrock Nilekani and people working with him went on to build a sprawling collection of free, interoperating online tools that add up to nothing less than a digital infrastructure for society. They cover government services, digital payments, banking, credit, and health care, offering convenience and access that would be eye-popping in wealthy countries a tenth of India’s size. In India those systems are called, collectively, “digital public infrastructure,” or DPI.

At 70 years old, Nilekani should be retired. But he has a few more ideas. India’s electrical grid is creaky and prone to failure; Nilekani wants to add a layer of digital communication to stabilize it. And then there’s his idea to expand the financial functions in DPI to the rest of the world, creating a global digital backbone for commerce that he calls the “finternet.”

“It sounds like some crazy stuff,” Nilekani says. “But I think these are all big ideas, which over the next five years will have demonstrable, material impact.” As a last act in public life, why not Aadhaarize the world?

Today, a farmer in a village in India, hours from the nearest bank, can collect welfare payments or transfer money by simply pressing a thumb to a fingerprint scanner at the local store. Digitally authenticated copies of driver’s licenses, birth certificates, and educational records can be accessed and shared via a digital wallet that sits on your smartphone.

In big cities, where cash is less and less common (just trying to break a bill can be a major headache), mobile payments are ubiquitous, whether you’re buying a TV from a high-street retailer or a coconut from a roadside cart. There are no fees, and any payment app or bank account can send money to any other. The country’s chaotic patchwork of public and private hospitals have begun digitizing all their medical records and uploading them to a nationwide platform. On the Open Network for Digital Commerce (ONDC), people can do online shopping searches on whatever app they want, and the results show sellers from an array of other platforms, too. The idea is to liberate small merchants and consumers from the walled gardens of online shopping giants like Amazon and the domestic giant Flipkart.

In the most populous nation on Earth—with 1.4 billion people—a large portion of the bureaucracy anyone encounters in daily life happens seamlessly and in the cloud.

At the heart of all these tools is Aadhaar. The system gives every Indian a 12-digit number that, in combination with either a fingerprint scan or an SMS code, allows access to government services, SIM cards, basic bank accounts, digital signature services, and social welfare payments. The Indian government says that since its inception in 2009, Aadhaar has saved 3.48 trillion rupees ($39.2 billion) by boosting efficiency, bypassing corrupt officials, and cutting other types of fraud. The system is controversial and imperfect—a database with 1.4 billion people in it comes with inherent security and privacy concerns. Still, in the most populous nation on Earth, a big portion of the bureaucracy anyone might encounter in daily life just happens in the cloud.

Nilekani was behind much of that innovation, marshaling an army of civil servants, tech companies, and volunteers. Now he sees it in action every day. “It reinforces that what you have done is not some abstract stuff, but real stuff for real people,” he says.

By his own admission, Nilekani is entering the twilight of his career. But it’s not over yet. He’s now “chief mentor” for the India Energy Stack (IES), a government initiative to connect the fragmented data held by companies responsible for generating, transmitting, and distributing power. India’s grids are unstable and disparate, but Nilekani hopes an Aadhaar-like move will help. IES aims to give unique digital identities not only to power plants and energy storage facilities but even to rooftop solar panels and electric vehicles. All the data attached to those things—device characteristics, energy rating certifications, usage information—will be in a common, machine-readable format and shared on the same open protocols.

Ideally, that’ll give grid operators a real-time view of energy supply and demand. And if it works, it might also make it simpler and cheaper for anyone to connect to the grid—even everyday folks selling excess power from their rooftop solar rigs, says RS Sharma, the chair of the project and Nilekani’s deputy while building Aadhaar.

Nilekani’s other side hustle is even more ambitious. His idea for a global “finternet” combines Aadhaarization with blockchains—creating digital representations called tokens for not only financial instruments like stocks or bonds but also real-world assets like houses or jewelry. Anyone from a bank to an asset manager or even a company could create and manage these tokens, but Nilekani’s team especially hopes the idea will help poor people trade their assets, or use them as loan collateral—expanding financial services to those who otherwise couldn’t access them.

It sounds almost wild-eyed. Yet the finternet project has 30 partners across four continents. Nilekani says it’ll launch next year.

Nilekani was born in Bengaluru, in 1955. His family was middle class and, Nilekani says, “seized with societal issues and challenges.” His upbringing was also steeped in the kind of socialism espoused by the newish nation’s first prime minister, Jawaharlal Nehru.

After studying electrical engineering at the Indian Institute of Technology, in 1981 Nilekani helped found Infosys, an information technology company that pioneered outsourcing and helped turned India into the world’s IT back office. In 1999, he was part of a government-appointed task force trying to upgrade the infrastructure and services in Bengaluru, then emerging as India’s tech capital. But Nilekani was at the time leery of being viewed as just another techno-optimist. “I didn’t want to be seen as naive enough to believe that tech could solve everything,” he says.

Seeing the scope of the problem changed his mind—sclerotic bureaucracy, endemic corruption, and financial exclusion were intractable without technological solutions. In 2008 Nilekani published a book, Imagining India: The Idea of a Renewed Nation. It was a manifesto for an India that could leapfrog into a networked future.

And it got him a job. At the time more than half the births in the country were not recorded, and up to 400 million Indians had no official identity document. Manmohan Singh, the prime minister, asked Nilekani to put into action an ill-defined plan to create a national identity card.

Nilekani’s team made a still-controversial decision to rely on biometrics. A system based on people’s fingerprints and retina scans meant nobody could sign up twice, and nobody had to carry paperwork. In terms of execution, it was like trying to achieve industrialization but skip a steam era. Deployment required a monumental data collection effort, as well as new infrastructure that could compare each new enrollment against hundreds of millions of existing records in seconds. At its peak, the Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI), the agency responsible for administering Aadhaar, was registering more than a million new users a day. That happened with a technical team of just about 50 developers, and in the end cost slightly less than half a billion dollars.

Buoyed by their success, Nilekani and his allies started casting around for other problems they could solve using the same digitize-the-real-world playbook. “We built more and more layers of capability,” Nilekani says, “and then this became a wider-ranging idea. More grandiose.”

While other countries were building digital backbones with full state control (as in China) or in public-private partnerships that favored profit-seeking corporate approaches (as in the US), Nilekani thought India needed something else. He wanted critical technologies in areas like identity, payments, and data sharing to be open and interoperable, not monopolized by either the state or private industry. So the tools that make up DPI use open standards and open APIs, meaning that anyone can plug into the system. No single company or institution controls access—no walled gardens.

Of course, another way to look at putting financial and government services and records into giant databases is that it’s a massive risk to personal liberty. Aadhaar, in particular, has faced criticism from privacy advocates concerned about the potential for surveillance. Several high-profile data breaches of Aadhaar records held by government entities have shaken confidence in the system, most recently in 2023, when security researchers found hackers selling the records of more than 800 million Indians on the dark web.

Technically, this shouldn’t matter—an Aadhaar number ought to be useless without biometric or SMS-based authentication. It’s “a myth that this random number is a very powerful number,” says Sharma, the onetime co-lead of UIDAI. “I don’t have any example where somebody’s Aadhaar disclosure would have harmed somebody.”

One problem is that in everyday use, Aadhaar users often bypass the biometric authentication system. To ensure that people use a genuine address at registration, Aadhaar administrators give people their numbers on an official-looking document. Indians co-opted this paperwork as a proof of identity on its own. And since the document—Indians even call it an “Aadhaar card”—doesn’t have an expiration date, it’s possible for people to get multiple valid cards with different details by changing their address or date of birth. That’s quite a loophole. In 2018 an NGO report found that 67% of people using Aadhaar to open a bank account relied on this verification document rather than digital authentication. That report was the last time anyone published data on the problem, so nobody knows how bad it is today. “Everybody’s living on anecdotes,” says Kiran Jonnalagadda, an anti-Aadhaar activist.

In other cases, flaws in Aadhaar’s biometric technology have caused people to be denied essential government services. The government downplays these risks, but again, it’s impossible to tell how serious the problem is because the UIDAI won’t disclose numbers. “There needs to be a much more honest acknowledgment, documentation, and then an examination of how those exclusions can be mitigated,” says Apar Gupta, director of the Internet Freedom Foundation.

Beyond the potential for fraud, it’s also true that the free and interoperable tools haven’t reached all the people who might find them useful, especially among India’s rural and poorer populations. Nilekani’s hopes for openness haven’t fully come to pass. Big e-commerce companies still dominate, and retail sales on ONDC have been dropping steadily since 2024, when financial incentives to participate began to taper off. The digital payments and government documentation services have hundreds of millions of users, numbers most global technology companies would love to see—but in a country as large as India, that leaves a lot of people out.

The usually calm Nilekani bristles at that criticism; he has heard it before. Detractors overlook the dysfunction that preceded these efforts, he says, and he remains convinced that technology was the only way forward. “How do you move a country of 1.4 billion people?” he asks. “There’s no other way you can fix it.”

The proof is self-evident, he says. Indians have opened more than 500 million basic bank accounts using Aadhaar; before it came into use, millions of those people had been completely unbanked. Earlier this year, India’s Unified Payments Interface overtook Visa as the world’s largest real-time payments system. “There is no way Aadhaar could have worked but for the fact that people needed this thing,” Nilekani says. “There’s no way payments would have worked without people needing it. So the voice of the people—they’re voting with their feet.”

That need might be present in countries beyond India. “Many countries don’t have a proper birth registration system. Many countries don’t have a payment system. Many countries don’t have a way for data to be leveraged,” Nilekani says. “So this is a very powerful idea.” It seems to be spreading. Foreign governments regularly send delegations to Bengaluru to study India’s DPI tools. The World Bank and the United Nations have tried to introduce the concept to other developing countries equally eager to bring their economies into the digital age. The Gates Foundation has established projects to promote digital infrastructure, and Nilekani has set up and funded a network of think tanks, research institutes, and other NGOs aimed at, as he says, “propagating the gospel.”

Still, he admits he might not live to see DPI go global. “There are two races,” Nilekani says. “My personal race against time and India’s race against time.” He worries that the economic potential of its vast young population—the so-called demographic dividend—could turn into a demographic disaster. Despite rapid growth, gains have been uneven. Youth unemployment remains stubbornly high—a particularly volatile problem in a large and economically turbulent country.

“Maybe I’m a junkie,” he says. “Why the hell am I doing all this? I think I need it. I think I need to keep curious and alive and looking at the future.” But that’s the thing about building the future: It never quite arrives.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Water shortages in Southern California made an indelible impression on Evelyn Wang ’00 when she was growing up in Los Angeles. “I was quite young, perhaps in first grade,” she says. “But I remember we weren’t allowed to turn our sprinklers on. And everyone in the neighborhood was given disinfectant tablets for the toilet and encouraged to keep flushing to a minimum. I didn’t understand exactly what was happening. But I saw that everyone in the community was affected by the scarcity of this resource.”

Today, as extreme weather events increasingly affect communities around the world, Wang is leading MIT’s effort to tackle the interlinked challenges of a changing climate and a burgeoning global demand for energy. Last April, after wrapping up a two-year stint directing the US Department of Energy’s Advanced Research Projects Agency–Energy (ARPA-E), she returned to the campus where she’d been both an undergraduate and a faculty member to become the inaugural vice president for energy and climate.

“The accelerating problem of climate change and its countless impacts represent the greatest scientific, technical, and policy challenge of this or any age,” MIT President Sally Kornbluth wrote in a January 2025 letter to the MIT community announcing the appointment. “We are tremendously fortunate that Evelyn Wang has agreed to lead this crucial work.”

MIT has studied and worked on problems of climate and energy for decades. In recent years, with temperatures rising, storms strengthening, and energy demands surging, that work has expanded and intensified, spawning myriad research projects, policy proposals, papers, and startups. The challenges are so urgent that MIT launched several Institute-wide initiatives, including President Rafael Reif’s Climate Grand Challenges (2020) and President Kornbluth’s Climate Project (2024).

But Kornbluth has argued that MIT needs to do even more. Her creation of the new VP-level post that Wang now holds underscores that commitment.

Wang is well suited for the role. The Ford Professor of Engineering at MIT and former head of the Department of Mechanical Engineering, she joined the faculty in 2007, shortly after she completed her PhD at Stanford University. Her research centers on thermal management and energy conversion and storage, but she also works on nano-engineered surfaces and materials, as well as water harvesting and purification. Wang and her colleagues have produced a device based on nanophotonic crystals that could double the efficiency of solar cells—one of MIT Technology Review’s 10 breakthrough technologies of 2017. And the device she invented with Nobel laureate Omar Yaghi for extracting water from very dry air was named one of 2017’s top 10 emerging technologies by Scientific American and the World Economic Forum, and in 2018 earned her the Prince Sultan Bin Abdulaziz International Prize for Water. (See story on this water harvesting research in the January/February issue of MIT Technology Review.)

Wang has a deep knowledge of the Institute—and even deeper roots here. (See “Family Ties,” MIT Alumni News, March/April 2015.) Her parents met at MIT as PhD students from Taiwan in the 1960s; they were married in the MIT chapel. When Wang arrived at MIT in 1996 as a first-year student, her brother Alex ’96, MEng ’97, had just graduated and was working on a master’s degree in electrical engineering. Her other brother, Ben, would earn his PhD at MIT in 2007. She even met her husband, Russell Sammon ’98, at MIT. Apart from her time at ARPA-E, a very brief stint at Bell Labs, and sabbatical work at Google, she has spent her entire professional career at the Institute. So she has a rare perspective on the resources MIT can draw on to respond to the climate and energy challenge.

“The beating heart of MIT is innovation,” she says. “We are innovators. And innovation is something that will help us leapfrog some of the potential hurdles as we work toward climate and energy solutions. Our ability to innovate can enable us to move closer toward energy security, toward sustainable resource development and use.”

The prevailing innovative mindset at MIT is backed by a deep desire to tackle the problem.Many people on campus are passionate about climate and energy, says Wang. “That is why President Kornbluth made this her flagship initiative. We are fortunate to have so many talented students and faculty, and to be able to rely on our infrastructure. I know they will all step up to meet the challenges.” But she is quick to point out that the problems are too large for any one entity—including MIT—to address on its own. So she’s aiming to encourage more collaboration both among MIT researchers and with other institutions.

“If we want to solve this problem of climate change, if we want to change the trajectory in the next decade, we cannot continue to do business as usual,” she says. “That is what is most exciting about this problem and, frankly, is why I came back to campus to take this job.”

The coupling of climate and energy in Wang’s portfolio is strategic. “Energy and climate are two sides of the same coin,” she explains. “A major reason we are seeing climate change is that we haven’t deployed solutions at a scale necessary to mitigate the CO2 emissions from the energy sector. The ways we generate energy and manage emissions are fundamental to any strategy addressing climate change. At the same time, the world demands more and more energy—a demand we can’t possibly meet through a single means.”

“Zero-emissions and low-carbon approaches will not be enough to supply the necessary energy or to reverse our impact on the climate … We need to do something truly transformational. That is the heart of the challenge.”

What’s more, she contends that switching from fossil fuels to cleaner energy, while fundamental, is only part of the solution. “Zero-emissions and low-­carbon approaches will not be enough to supply the necessary energy or to reverse our impact on the climate,” she says. “We need to consider the environmental impacts of these new fuels we develop and deploy. We need to use data analysis to move goods and energy more efficiently and intelligently. We need to consider raising more of our food in water and using food by-products and waste to help sequester carbon. In short, we need to do something truly transformational. That is the heart of the challenge.”

That challenge seems destined to grow more daunting in the coming years. There are still, Wang observes, areas of “energy poverty”—places where people cannot access sufficient energy to sustain their well-being. But solving that problem will only drive up energy production and consumption worldwide. The explosive growth of AI will likely do the same, since the huge data centers that power the technology require enormous quantities of energy for both computation and cooling.

Wang believes that while AI will continue to drive electricity demand, it can also contribute to creating a more sustainable future.“We can use AI to develop climate and energy solutions,” she says. “AI can play a primary role in solution sets, can give us new and improved ways to manage intermittent loads in the energy grid. It can help us develop new catalysts and chemicals or help us stabilize the plasma we’ll use in nuclear fusion. It could augment climate and geospatial modeling that would allow us to predict the impact of potential climate solutions before we implement them. We could even use AI to reduce computational needs and thereby ease cooling demand.”

MIT was humming with climate and energy research long before Wang returned to campus in 2025 after wrapping up her work at ARPA-E. Almost 400 researchers across 90% of MIT’s departments responded to President Reif’s 2020 Climate Grand Challenges initiative. The Institute awarded $2.7 million to 27 finalist teams and identified five flagship projects, including one to create an early warning system to help mitigate the impact of climate disasters, another to predict and prepare for extreme weather events, and an ambitious project to slash nearly half of all industrial carbon emissions.

About 250 MIT faculty and senior researchers are now involved in the Climate Project at MIT, a campus-wide initiative launched in 2024 that works to generate and implement climate solutions, tools, and policy proposals. Conceived to bolster MIT’s already significant efforts as a leading source of technological, behavioral, and policy solutions to global climate issues, the Climate Project has identified six “missions”: decarbonizing energy and industry; preserving the atmosphere, land, and oceans; empowering frontline community action; designing resilient and prosperous cities; enabling new policy approaches; and wild cards, a catch-all category that supports development of unconventional solutions outside the scope of the other missions. Faculty members direct each mission.

With so much climate research already underway,a large part of Wang’s new role is to support and deepen existing projects. But to fully tap into MIT’s unique capabilities, she says, she’s aiming to foster some cultural shifts. And that begins with identifying ways to facilitate cooperation—both across the Institute and with external partners—on a scale that can make “something truly transformational” happen, she says. “At this stage, with the challenges we face in energy and climate, we need to do something ambitious.”

In Wang’s view, getting big results depends on taking a big-picture, holistic approach that will require unprecedented levels of collaboration. “MIT faculty have always treasured their independence and autonomy,” she says. “Traditionally, we’ve tried to let 1,000 flowers bloom. And traditionally we’ve done that well, often with outstanding results. But climate and energy are systems problems, which means we need to create a systems solution. How do we bring these diverse faculty together? How do we align their efforts, not just in technology, but also in policy, science, finance, and social sciences?”

To encourage MIT faculty to collaborate across departments, schools, and disciplines, Wang recently announced that the MIT Climate Project would award grants of $50,000 to $250,000 to collaborative faculty teams that work on six- to 24-month climate research projects. Student teams are invited to apply for research grants of up to $15,000.“We can’t afford to work in silos,” she says. “People from wildly diverse fields are working on the same problems and speaking different professional languages. We need to bring people together in an integrative way so we can attack the problem holistically.”

Wang also wants colleagues to reach beyond campus. MIT, she says, needs to form real, defined partnerships with other universities, as well as with industries, investors, and philanthropists. “This isn’t just an MIT problem,” she says. “Individual efforts and 1,000 flowers alone will not be enough to meet these challenges.”

Thinking holistically—and in terms of systems—will help focus efforts on the areas that will have the greatest impact. At a Climate Project presentation in October, Wang outlined an approach that would focus on building well-being within communities. This will begin with efforts to empower communities by developing coastal resilience, to decarbonize ports and shipping, and to design and build data centers that integrate smoothly and sustainably with nearby communities. She encouraged her colleagues to think in terms of big-picture solutions for the future and then to work on the components needed to build that future.

“As researchers, we sometimes jump to a solution before we have fully defined the problem,” she explains. “Let’s take the problem of decarbonization in transportation. The solution we’ve come up with is to electrify our vehicles. When we run up against the problem of the range of these vehicles, our first thought is to create higher-density batteries. But the real problem we’re facing isn’t about batteries. It’s about increasing the range of these vehicles. And the solution to that problem isn’t necessarily a more powerful battery.”

“Too often the narrative around climate is steeped in doom and gloom … The goal of any climate project is to build and protect well-being. How can we help communities thrive, empower people to live as they wish, even as the climate is changing?”

Wang is confident that her MIT colleagues have both the capacity and the desire to embrace the holistic approach she envisions. “When I was accepted to MIT as an undergraduate and visited the campus, the thing that made me certain I wanted to enroll here was the people,” she recalls. “They weren’t just talented. They had so many different interests. They were passionate about solving big problems. And they were eager to learn from one another. That spirit hasn’t changed. And that’s the spirit I and my team can tap into.”

Wang believes MIT and other institutions working on climate and energy solutions also need to change how we talk about the challenge. “Too often the narrative around climate is steeped in doom and gloom,” she says. “The underlying issue here is our well-being. That’s what we care about, not the climate. The goal of any climate project is to build and protect well-being. How can we help communities thrive, empower people to live as they wish, even as the climate is changing? How can we create conditions of resilience, sustainability, and prosperity? That is the framework I would like us to build on.” For example, in areas where extreme weather threatens homes or rising temperatures are harming human health, we should be developing affordable technologies that make dwellings more resilient and keep people cooler.

Wang’s colleagues at MIT concur with her assessment of the mission ahead. They also have a deep respect for her scholarship and leadership. “I couldn’t think of a better person to represent MIT’s diverse and powerful ability to attack climate,” says Susan Solomon, the Lee and Geraldine Martin Professor of Environmental Studies at MIT and recipient of the US National Medal of Science for her work on the Antarctic ozone hole. “Communicating MIT’s capabilities to provide what the nation needs—not only in engineering but also in … economics, the physical, chemical, and biological sciences, and much more—is an immense challenge.” But she’s confident that Wang will do it justice. “Evelyn is a consummate storyteller,” she says.

“She’s tremendously quick at learning new fields and driving toward what the real nuggets are that need to be addressed in solving hard problems,” says Elsa Olivetti, PhD ’07, the Jerry McAfee Professor in Engineering and director of the MIT Climate Project’s Decarbonizing Energy and Industry mission. “Her direct, meticulous thinking and leadership style mean that she can focus teams within her office to do the work that will be most impactful at scale.”

Wang’s experience at ARPA-E is expected to be especially useful. “The current geopolitical situation and the limited amount of research funding available relative to the scale of the climate problem pose formidable challenges to bringing MIT’s strengths to bear on the problem,” says Rohit Karnik, director of the Abdul Latif Jameel Water and Food Systems Lab (J-WAFS) and a collaborator with Wang on numerous projects and initiatives since both joined the mechanical engineering faculty in 2007. “Evelyn’s leadership experience at MIT and in government, her ability to take a complex situation and define a clear vision, and her passion to make a difference will serve her well in her new role.”

Wang’s new MIT appointment is seen as a good thing beyond the Institute as well. “A role like this requires a skill set that is difficult to find in one individual,” says Krista Walton, vice chancellor for research and innovation at North Carolina State University. Walton and Wang collaborated on multiple projects, including the DARPA work that produced the device for extracting water from very dry air based on the original prototype Wang co-developed. “You need scientific depth, an understanding of the federal and global landscape, a collaborative instinct and the ability to be a convener, and a strategic vision,” Walton says—and she can’t imagine a better pick for the job.

“Evelyn has an extraordinary ability to bridge fundamental science with real-world application,” she says. “She approaches collaboration as a true partnership and not as a transaction.”

Climate scientists explore broad swaths of time, tracking trends in temperature, greenhouse gases, volcanic activity, vegetation, and more across hundreds, thousands, and even millions of years. Even average temperatures and precipitation levels are calculated over periods of three decades.

But in the realm of politics, change happens much faster, prompting sudden and sometimes startling shifts in culture and policy. The current US administration has proposed widespread budget cuts in climate and energy research. These have included slicing more than $1.5 billion from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), canceling multiple climate-related missions at NASA, and shuttering the US Global Change Research Program (USGCRP), the agency responsible for publishing the National Climate Assessment. The Trump administration submitted a budget request that would cut the National Science Foundation budget from more than $9 billion to just over $4 billion for 2026. The New York Times reported that NSF grant funding for STEM education from January through mid-May 2025 was down 80% from its 10-year average, while NSF grant awards for math, physics, chemistry, astronomy, and materials science research were down 67%. In September, the US Department of Energy announced it had terminated 223 projects that “did not adequately advance the nation’s energy needs, were not economically viable, and would not provide a positive return on investment of taxpayer dollars.” Among the agencies affected is ARPA-E, the agency Wang directed before returning to MIT. Meanwhile, MIT research programs that rely on government sources of funding will also feel the impact of the cuts.

Acknowledging the difficulties she and MIT may face in the present moment, Wang still prefers to look forward. “Of course this is a challenging time,” she says. “There are near-term challenges and long-term challenges. We need to focus on those long-term challenges. As President Kornbluth has said, we need to continue to advocate for research and education. We need to pursue long-term solutions, to follow our convictions in addressing problems in energy and climate. And we need to be ready to seize the opportunities that reside in these long-term challenges.”

Wang also sees openings for short-term collaboration—areas where MIT and the current administration can find common ground and goals. “There is still a huge area of opportunity for us to align our interests with those of this administration,” she says. “We can move the needle forward together on energy, on national security, on minerals, on economic competitiveness. All these are interests we share, and there are pathways we can follow to meet these challenges to our nation together. MIT is a major force in the nuclear space, in both fission and fusion. These, along with geothermal, could provide the power base we need to meet our energy demands. There are significant opportunities for partnerships with this or any administration to unlock some of these innovations and implement them.”

While she views herself as a researcher and an academic, Wang’s relevant government experience should prove especially useful in her VP role at MIT. In her two years as director of ARPA-E, she coordinated a broad array of the US Department of Energy’s early-stage research and development in energy generation, storage, and use. “I think I had the best job in government,” she says. Designed to operate at arm’s length from the Department of Energy, ARPA-E searches for high-risk, high-reward energy innovation projects. “More than one observer has called ARPA-E a moonshot factory,” she says.

Seeking out and facilitating “moonshot”-­worthy projects at a national and sometimes global scale gave Wang a broader lens through which to view issues of energy and climate. It also taught her that big ideas do not translate into big solutions automatically. “I learned what it takes to make an impact on energy technology at ARPA-E and I will be forever grateful,” she says. “I saw how game-changing ideas can take a decade to go from concept to deployment. I learned to appreciate the diversity of talent and innovation in the national ecosystem composed of laboratories, startups, and institutions. I saw how that ecosystem could zero in to identify real problems, envision diverse pathways, and create prototypes. And I also saw just how hard that journey is.”

MIT researchers are tackling climate and energy issues from multiple angles, working on everything from decarbonizing energy and industry to designing resilient and prosperous cities. Find out more at climateproject.mit.edu.

While MIT is already an important element in that ecosystem, Wang and her colleagues want the Institute to play an even more prominent role. “We can be a convener and collaborator, first across all of MIT’s departments, and then with industry, the financial world, and governments,” she says. “We need to do aggressive outreach and find like-minded partners.”

“Although the problems of climate and climate change are global, the most effective way MIT can address them is locally,” said Wang at the October presentation of the MIT Climate Project. “Working across schools and disciplines, collaborating with external partners, we will develop targeted solutions for individual places and communities—solutions that can then serve as templates for other places and communities.” But she also cautions against one-size-fits-all solutions. “Solar panels, for example, work wonderfully, but only in areas that have sufficient space and sunlight,” she explains. “Institutions like MIT can showcase a diversity of approaches and determine the best approach for each individual context.”

Most of all, Wang wants her colleagues to be proactive. “Because MIT is a factory of ideas, perhaps even a moonshot factory, we need to think boldly and continue to think boldly so we can make an impact as soon as possible,” she says. She also wants her colleagues to stay hopeful and not feel daunted by a challenge that can at times feel overwhelming. “We will build pilots, one at a time, and demonstrate that these projects are not only possible but practical,” she says. “And that is how we will build a future everyone wants to live in.”

            <div id="article-text">Few people, if any, contemplate stars—celestial or cinematic—the way Aomawa Shields does.

An astronomer and astrobiologist, Shields explores the potential habitability of planets beyond our solar system. But she is also a classically trained actor—and that’s helped shape her professional trajectory in unexpected ways.

Today, Shields is an associate professor in the Department of Physics and Astronomy at the University of California, Irvine, where she oversees a research team that uses computer models to explore conditions on exoplanets, or planets that revolve around stars other than the sun. But while searching for life many light-years away is her day job, creative endeavors round out her purpose on Earth.

In 2023 Shields published a memoir, Life on Other Planets: A Memoir of Finding My Place in the Universe. She has started an influential educational program that encourages young girls to explore space, given a hugely popular TED Talk about how we’ll find life on other planets, and won a string of prestigious academic awards, honors, and grants. She also plays the violin, cooks, practices yoga, and is a mom. And as what she calls a “rest leader”—a professional proponent of slowing down—Shields has somehow managed the seemingly impossible: She makes time.

Her unorthodox path began on the screen, in the realm of make-believe.

“I wanted to become an astronaut. That dream started very early in my life, at the age of 12, after seeing a movie that dramatized kids getting launched into space,” she says, referring to SpaceCamp, an ’80s kids’ comedy about an accidental space shuttle flight.

The next bit of cinematic inspiration cemented her interest.

“Charlotte Blackwood was an astrophysicist, and she was very glamorous, too,” Shields says, smiling at how she was captivated by the heroine in Top Gun. “There’s an iconic scene where she’s walking down the aisle between Tom Cruise and other pilot trainees, and she just kind of whips off her glasses and just looks like such a badass.”

A high-achieving student while growing up in California, Canada, and Massachusetts, Shields made her way to Phillips Exeter Academy, in large part drawn by its state-of-the-art astronomical observatory. Once there, she got pulled into acting in a serious way. “Enter a new dream,” she says.

Throughout high school her astronomy and acting aspirations “kind of danced beside each other,” Shields remembers. “But I held firm to the first one and went to MIT because I understood that it’s the best science school in the country. I learned that at the age of 12—that’s where I’m going to go.”

At MIT, Shields struggled academically at first and took refuge in the creative arts. She was chosen to participate in the Burchard Scholars Program, whose monthly dinner seminars bring faculty members together with students who excel in the arts, social sciences, and humanities. She sang in the a cappella group the Muses and performed in lots of plays. At the end of her senior year, she found herself wondering: “Do I go to grad school in acting or astronomy?”

“There were a lot of these things that seemed to be aligning—that were telling me: Go back and get that PhD.”

The latter won out, but not for long. Shields headed to a graduate program in astronomy at the University of Wisconsin–Madison. “During that year, I had a white male professor tell me to consider other career options, and that was hard to hear,” she says. She remembers thinking, “I’m going to the other dream because clearly someone’s telling me that I don’t belong here. Maybe they’re right.”

So she applied to UCLA, where she got an MFA in acting, leaving astronomy for more than a decade. But then, when Shields was working odd jobs to supplement her acting gigs, a mentor from her undergraduate years encouraged her to look on a Caltech-operated job website. She saw an opening for a help desk operator at the Spitzer Space Telescope, an infrared telescope that is particularly adept at viewing the formation of young stars—and it only required a bachelor’s degree. “I’d refer the harder questions to the PhDs,” she says. “But by taking that job, I got to go to astronomy talks again … This field of exoplanets had just exploded during the time I’d been away.”

Shields had some success in acting, including a part in a film called Nine Lives, which screened at the Sundance Film Festival. But a big break—and then heartbreak—came after she was cast as the host of the show Wired Science, only to lose the job when the producers decided to change presenters. It was a “devastating moment,” she says.

Soon after, she emailed the astrophysicist and science communications luminary Neil deGrasse Tyson, whom she’d been introduced to over email by an astronomer working with the Spitzer Space Telescope, and relayed what had happened. He replied that he’d seen her in the pilot and told her that “without a PhD you don’t have that street cred if you want to do science television,” she recalls. Meanwhile, she had applied to NASA’s astronaut candidate program but didn’t make it past the first level. (She did, however, get to play an astronaut in a recent Toyota ad.) “There were a lot of these things that seemed to be aligning—that were telling me: Go back and get that PhD,” she says. So she did, earning her doctorate in astronomy and astrobiology in 2014 from the University of Washington.

Astrobiology, Shields explains, is a relatively new field that studies the origin, evolution, and distribution of life in the universe: “It’s about how life got started on Earth.”

Astrobiologists might focus on the habitability of planets, or on methods for exploring life on other planets, or on liquids other than water that could support life. It’s a highly interdisciplinary field. “There are astronomers that are looking for these planets and are using their particular field of expertise to answer that question: Are we alone?” Shields explains. Some of them are “also chemists and biologists and oceanographers and geologists who tackle these questions from their own lens and specific area of expertise,” she says. “That’s why I love it. As an astrobiologist, we don’t have to get 15 PhDs. We get to collaborate with people in different departments who lend their own expertise … on those science questions.”

Shields is trying to answer a question sparked by the night sky—one that’s deeply personal yet universal in both the astronomical and the colloquial sense. “Ever since I was a little girl, I would look up at the sky and wonder what was out there,” she says. “It comes from a sense of wonder for me. I still have that feeling when I look up at the night sky and I see these little pinpoints of light. I wonder: Is there anyone looking back at me? … How far does space go?”

There are, she explains, 100 billion stars in our galaxy, most orbited by at least one planet, and over 100 billion galaxies beyond ours. That’s about 1022 stars in the universe. The likelihood that only Earth was able to produce life “I think is pretty low,” Shields says.

“I’m looking for planetary environments that could be conducive to life beyond Earth,” she says. “And my team does that largely using climate models. These are the same kinds of models that can predict climate and weather on Earth.”

Shields plugs information gathered by observational astronomers into such models, along with different potential combinations of other, unknown variables—like the type of light a planet receives from its host star, the composition of its atmosphere and surface, and certain orbital information. “There’s only so much that you can really tell about a planet from the telescope information that you get,” she explains. “We can explore that parameter space with climate models and say: Okay, if it has this surface composition, this is what the temperature would be like on this planet. If it has this atmospheric composition, this type of orbit, this is what the climate would be like, and this is how habitable it would be across its surface.”

Since the early 1990s, astronomers have discovered 6,000 exoplanets. Shields says those in Earth’s size range—in which she’s most interested—number in the hundreds. A smaller subset of those are orbiting in what’s called the “habitable zone” of their star, creating warm enough conditions to maintain water in liquid form—the key to life. So far, as many as 100 or so planets that fall into that category have been identified, but the James Webb Space Telescope, launched in 2021, could find even more potentially habitable planets by detecting “biosignatures” suggesting a biological presence, such as particular gases in their atmospheres or glints that might be reflections of water on the planetary surface.

Being able to detect more of these sorts of signals, Shields says, is the next “big mission” in astronomy.

Today, in her academic work, her mind hurtles to the farthest reaches of the universe. But in her precious hours outside of academia, she has learned to be still. When her work schedule started to overwhelm her, Shields’s health began to suffer. Then she discovered the practice of yoga nidra—an ancient form of meditation in which practitioners are guided into a deeply restful “yogic sleep.” Shields read the book Do Less: A Revolutionary Approach to Time and Energy Management for Ambitious Women, which claims that 20 or 30 minutes of yoga nidra “feels like three hours of sleep in your body,” she says. “And as the mother of a young child, I was like: Okay, sign me up!”

Last year she trained with Karen Brody, author of Daring to Rest: Reclaim Your Power with Yoga Nidra Rest Meditation, and became a certified facilitator. “It’s been important to me to share it broadly and to really try to do my part to introduce the culture of academia, in particular, to this notion of resting as a daily practice,” she says. Now she’s at work on a book about her attempt to moderate—to resist the temptation to take on too much. She has learned to decline invitations and put firm boundaries between her work and personal life.

Shields has realized that her seemingly disparate interests in astronomy and acting don’t have to be mutually exclusive. Combining them makes her a more effective educator.

On a weekday in August, an ayurvedic soup simmers on her kitchen stove. A music stand occupies the corner of a room where she sometimes picks up her violin and plays fiddle tunes. (Her parents, both professional musicians, derived her name from a chant of vowel sounds they made up.) She mentions the poem “swim | women of color”by Nayyirah Waheed and recites it in a soft, rich voice. Part of it goes: “This structure counts on your inability to say no. mean no. they take no from our first breath. go back and return it to your mouth. your heart. your light.”

“I need to graciously let go or say no—make room for someone else to say yes,” Shields says. “That allows me to have more spaciousness in my schedule, because one thing I’ve discovered is that women of color, as we proceed up the academic ladder, the requests just exponentially increase, and so saying no is not simply an important skill—it’s a survival skill.”

Along the way, Shields has come to realize that her seemingly disparate interests in astronomy and acting don’t have to be mutually exclusive. In fact, combining them—and sharing her passion for both—makes her a more effective educator. Her training as an actor helps her craft lectures that keep students engaged and animates her presentations, including her TED Talk, in a way that resonates with nonscientists.

Shields is also tapping into her love of acting to inspire the next generation of scientists who will help answer astronomy’s big questions. As part of a postdoctoral fellowship through the National Science Foundation, she was asked to design an educational outreach component. “I was like: Is there a scenario in which I could use acting to teach astronomy?” she says. “And I looked it up. There was precedent for that. Astronomy education journals had shown that when you involve girls in creative arts—theater, writing—and you incorporate that into astronomy education, you increase girls’ confidence in both asking and answering questions.”

The finding resonated with her own experience. After all, it was acting—which she turned to when her professor discouraged her from studying astronomy—that gave her the confidence to pursue astronomy again. “I looked at acting as this outlet, this safe space,” she says. “Nobody could tell me that I was wrong as an actor.”

With that in mind, Shields launched Rising Stargirls, which holds workshops using the creative arts to teach astronomy to ­middle-school-aged girls of all backgrounds. She and her colleagues have since published a study showing that girls who attended the program reported being more excited to take science classes and were more likely to believe they could do well in science.

“We want them to know that who they are is inherently pivotal and critical to their study and practice of astronomy,” Shields says. “The sciences are incredibly creative, and they get to bring that creative imagination and creative inspiration they find through the arts into learning about the universe.”

That same exchange has played out in Shields’s life, but it’s only recently that she’s come to see similarities between her roles as an astronomer and an actor. “They’re both about story,” she says.

Actors have to convey the arc or evolution of a story through the lives of their characters. “Stars, ­planets—they have lives, too,” Shields says. “They have births, they have evolution, and they die. It’s my job as a scientist to unveil the story—to discover the story of whether there’s life elsewhere.”

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The AI industry has become adept at measuring itself. Benchmarks improve, model scores rise, and every new release arrives with a list of metrics meant to signal progress. And yet, somewhere between the lab and real life, something keeps slipping.

Which model actually feels better to use?
Which answers would a human trust?
Which system would you put in front of customers, employees, or citizens and feel comfortable standing behind it?

That gap is where LMArena has quietly built its business, and why investors just put $150 million behind it at a $1.7 billion valuation, in a Series A round. The lead investors were Felicis and UC Investments, with participation from major venture firms (Andreessen Horowitz, Kleiner Perkins, Lightspeed, The House Fund, Laude Ventures).

For years, benchmarks were the currency of AI credibility: accuracy scores, reasoning tests and standardized datasets. They worked until they didn’t. As models grew larger and more similar, benchmark improvements became marginal. Worse, models began to optimize for the tests themselves rather than real use cases. Static evaluations struggled to reflect how AI behaves in open-ended, messy human interactions.

At the same time, AI systems moved out of labs and into everyday workflows: drafting emails, writing code, powering customer support, assisting with research and advising professionals. The question shifted from “Can the model do this?” to “Should we trust it when it does?”

That’s a different kind of measurement problem.

LMArena’s answer was simple and radical: stop scoring models in isolation. On its platform, users submit a prompt and receive two anonymized responses. No branding. No model names. Just answers. Then the user picks the better one, or neither.

One vote. One comparison. Repeated millions of times.

The result isn’t a definitive “best,” but a living signal of human preference , how people respond to tone, clarity, verbosity and real-world usefulness. When the prompt isn’t clean or predictable, that signal changes. And it captures something benchmarks often miss.

LMArena isn’t about whether a model produces a factually correct answer. It’s about whether humans prefer it when it does. That distinction is subtle but meaningful in practice. Rankings on the Arena leaderboard are now referenced by developers and labs before releases and product decisions. Major models from OpenAI, Google and Anthropic are regularly evaluated there.

Without traditional marketing, LMArena became a mirror the industry watches.

The $150 million round isn’t just a vote of confidence in LMArena’s product. It signals that AI evaluation itself is becoming infrastructure. As the number of models explodes, enterprise buyers face a new question: not how to get AI, but which AI to trust. Vendor claims and classical benchmarks don’t always translate to real-world reliability. Internal testing is expensive and slow.

A neutral, third-party signal, something that sits between model builders and users  is emerging as a critical layer. That’s where LMArena lives. In September 2025, it launched AI Evaluations, a commercial service that turns its crowdsourced comparison engine into a product enterprises and labs can pay to access. LMArena says this service achieved an annualized run rate of about $30 million within months of launch.

For regulators and policymakers, this kind of human-anchored signal matters too. Oversight frameworks need evidence that reflects real usage, not idealized scenarios.

LMArena’s approach isn’t without debate. Platforms that rely on public voting and crowdsourced signals can reflect the preferences of active users, which may not align with the needs of specific professional domains. In response, competitors like Scale AI’s SEAL Showdown have emerged, aiming to offer more granular, representative model rankings across languages, regions and professional contexts.

Academic research also notes that voting-based leaderboards can be susceptible to manipulation if safeguards aren’t in place, and that such systems may favor superficially appealing responses over technically correct ones if quality control isn’t rigorous.

These debates highlight that no single evaluation method captures every dimension of model behavior, but they also underscore the demand for richer, human-grounded signals beyond traditional benchmarks.

There’s a quiet assumption in AI that trust will emerge naturally as models improve. Better reasoning, so the logic goes, will lead to better outcomes. That framing treats alignment as a technical problem with technical solutions.

LMArena challenges that idea. Trust, in real contexts, is social and contextual. It’s built through experience, not claims. It’s shaped by feedback loops that don’t collapse under scale. By letting users, not companies, decide what works, LMArena introduces friction where the industry often prefers momentum. It slows things down just enough to ask, “Is this actually better, or just newer?”

That’s an uncomfortable question in a market driven by constant release cycles. It’s also why LMArena’s rise feels inevitable.

LMArena doesn’t promise safety. It doesn’t declare models good or bad. It doesn’t replace regulation or responsibility. What it does is simpler and more powerful: it keeps score in public. As AI systems become embedded in everyday decisions, tracking performance over time becomes less optional. Someone has to notice regressions, contextual shifts and usability patterns.

In sports, referees and statisticians fill this role. In markets, auditors and rating agencies do. In AI, we’re still inventing that infrastructure.

LMArena’s funding round suggests investors believe this role won’t stay marginal for long. Because when AI is everywhere, the hardest questions aren’t what it can do. They are who we trust when it does it, and how we know we’re right.

            <div id="article-text">For years, the tech industry equated success with scale. Bigger stages, larger crowds, more logos, more panels, more noise. Five thousand people became ten thousand. Ten thousand became the goal.

Somewhere along the way, that stopped making sense.

Founders and executives didn’t announce a boycott. They simply stopped showing up.

What we see today is not a rejection of events, but a correction in how people who actually run companies choose to spend their time. The shift is subtle, but consistent. Fewer large conferences. More small, curated gatherings. More closed rooms. More dinners. More tables of twelve.

TNW City Coworking space - Where your best work happens

A workspace designed for growth, collaboration, and endless networking opportunities in the heart of tech.

Big tech events struggle because they optimize for visibility, not usefulness. A founder does not need three days of generic content, dozens of panels with no real interaction, or networking sessions where relevance is left to chance.

At scale, everything becomes superficial by default. Conversations shorten. Access disappears. The signal is drowned by the format itself.

What founders look for instead is simple. Context. Trust. Direct access. Conversations without performance. The kind of environment where people can speak honestly, not publicly.

Even when larger conferences still make sense, there is a clear psychological ceiling. Around one thousand participants, in exceptional cases. Beyond that point, quality becomes impossible to control. The event stops being a place where decisions are made and turns into a product designed for mass consumption.

And tech, especially at the founder and executive level, no longer behaves like a mass industry. It behaves like a precision one.

This is why smaller, niche conferences outperform larger ones on every meaningful metric. Ten relevant people in a room will always create more value than a thousand irrelevant ones in a hall.

At a small table, access is natural. No one needs to chase anyone. Trust forms faster. Real conversations happen because there is no audience to impress.

The most important discussions in tech have never happened on stage. They happen before the lights turn on and after the microphones are off.

In parallel with this shift, we have been preparing a private community limited to one thousand founders and executives. It is strictly invite only. Not a platform. Not a public group. Not designed for scale. Designed for relevance. Quality is protected precisely by limitation.

One thing we can say publicly is that TNW will return with an event in 2026. Details, format, and the official launch will be announced soon, but not here. What matters is that this return will not mirror the old model. It will reflect how the industry actually operates today.

Big events are not disappearing. They are simply no longer where important decisions are made.

Across the industry, the shift is already happening. Smaller rooms. Sharper conversations. People who actually need to be there.

            <div id="article-text">Five stars used to mean something. People still read reviews before buying software. They just don’t trust them the way they used to. And no, this isn’t about fake reviews or obvious scams. Those are easy to spot. The real problem is more uncomfortable. The review economy didn’t collapse. It slowly drifted away from its original purpose.

User reviews began as authentic buyer guidance, but they’ve morphed into strategic assets for businesses. Scroll through any app store or e-commerce site: everything is “top-rated” and lavished with praise. If every product gleams with a 4.8/5 rating, those stars start to lose their meaning.

Consumers aren’t fooled, in fact, the share of people who trust online reviews as much as personal recommendations plummeted from nearly 80% in 2020 to just 42% in 2025

We read the glowing comments, but we’ve learned to read between the lines.

TNW City Coworking space - Where your best work happens

A workspace designed for growth, collaboration, and endless networking opportunities in the heart of tech.

It’s not hard to see why trust has eroded. Companies have figured out that great reviews drive sales, so they’ve turned the whole system into a numbers game. High ratings aren’t just social proof now, they’re a growth tactic.  In other words, more stars = more money. So of course businesses are chasing stars like their life depends on it. And in a way, it does.

Behind the scenes, many companies actively engineer their review scores. One common tactic is to time the ask just right. For instance, some businesses send out a Net Promoter Score (NPS) survey to gauge your sentiment “How likely are you to recommend us?”

If you rate them a 9 or 10 (a promoter), you’re immediately nudged to post a public review. If you give a lukewarm or low score, the feedback form quietly thanks you and never mentions writing a review at all.

Only the happiest customers get the gentle push to “Share your experience!” This practice is so widespread it even has a name: “review gating.”

It’s essentially filtering which customers get invited to leave a review based on their initial feedback. Platforms officially frown on it (Google outright forbids “selectively soliciting positive reviews”), but behind closed doors it remains a growth hacker’s favorite trick.

Then there’s the outright incentivization. Perhaps you’ve received an email offering a discount, gift card, or free month of service in exchange for writing a review. It’s framed as a thank-you for your time, of course – “Share your honest feedback and get 10% off your next purchase!” – but the intent is clear.

In an economy of fake praise, even regulators have had to step in to remind everyone that trust isn’t a commodity to be bought. Companies know how to play the game from the other side too: suppressing negativity.

Unhappy customer feedback is quietly diverted to support teams or private channels, where it can be resolved (or simply contained) out of public view. The result is a skewed reality, a glossy wall of five-star testimonials that obscure any hint of dissatisfaction. It’s a great sales tool. It’s terrible for the truth.

Why go to such lengths to manicure the ratings? Because the platforms themselves reward it. The algorithms that sort and highlight products aren’t trying to surface the most truthful review; they’re trying to maximize engagement and conversion.

High ratings and large volumes of reviews make people more likely to click “Buy Now.” That means more conversion for sellers and more commission for the marketplace. In other words, the algorithm is biased toward whatever boosts the platform’s monetization metrics.

A bunch of five-star reviews isn’t just ego bait,  it’s algorithm bait.

Think about it: products with a 4.7-star average and hundreds of reviews tend to appear at the top of search results and recommendation lists. They convert better, so the system pushes them more.

More visibility leads to more sales, which reinforces the high ranking. It’s a feedback loop powered by positive feedback (pun intended). If a vendor can game their way into that virtuous cycle, via perfectly timed prompts or purchased praise, the platform’s code will happily amplify them.

Authenticity doesn’t earn you a top slot; performance does. The incentive is clear: keep it positive, and keep it plentiful. In the review economy, volume and sentiment are king.

Worse, some marketplaces have blurred the line between genuine high-rated listings and paid placement. It’s an open secret that many platforms offer sponsored spots or pay-to-play schemes, think “featured” placements, ads masquerading as top picks, or vendor subscriptions that subtly boost visibility.

Money talks, even if it speaks over the voice of authentic customer feedback. (To be fair, a few holdouts still refuse to monetize their review rankings or sell out their star system, but they’re the exception, not the rule).

Consumers aren’t sitting idly by in this charade. We’ve become savvy at sniffing out over-polished BS. The modern buyer knows how the game is played, and many are adapting their behavior to cope with the broken review system.

First, there’s a migration of trust to private networks and off-platform channels. Instead of relying on the star-average on a marketplace, people turn to friends, colleagues, and niche communities for real advice.

Think about the last time you were unsure about a purchase, maybe you shot a quick message to a group chat, or asked in a private Slack channel, “Hey, has anyone used this product? Is it actually any good?” Personal recommendations feel reliable again, precisely because they’re not part of the public review circus.

Second, savvy consumers cross-check everything. Rather than trusting one site’s reviews, they compare across multiple sources, the product might be 4.8 on the official store, but what’s it rated elsewhere?

Is there a discrepancy between the slick website testimonials and the chatter on Reddit? More often than not, shoppers now triangulate information. In fact, three out of four people use two or more sites when reading reviews, rather than putting all their faith in one platform’s word. We instinctively seek a consensus of truth across the noise.

Finally, many have decided the best judge is themselves. “Try before you buy” has made a comeback as a defense against dubious reviews. Free trials, freemium tiers, generous return policies, consumers leverage them all to test products firsthand.

If a software platform promises the world in its curated testimonials, a savvy buyer will take the 14-day free trial and see if it lives up to the hype. In sectors like enterprise software, where choices are costly and critical, buyers might run a pilot program or proof-of-concept rather than trust glossy case studies. Essentially, experience has become the new review.

All this has serious implications for platforms and software marketplaces. These businesses built their empires on user-generated trust, turning customer opinion into a key part of the shopping experience.

If that trust evaporates, the model cracks. We’re already seeing the early signs: users skipping the review tab, or treating every five-star rating with a healthy dose of skepticism.

If the review economy continues on its current path, platforms risk becoming mere transaction processors rather than trust brokers.

For the marketplaces, this is both a crisis and an opportunity. The crisis is obvious: loss of credibility. If people no longer believe what they read on your platform, they’ll seek validation elsewhere, and your influence over purchase decisions diminishes.

But the opportunity lies in reform. Platforms could double down on authenticity as a feature, verifying purchases, cracking down harder on fraudulent and incentivized reviews, and highlighting more qualitative, nuanced feedback instead of simple star counts.

There’s even a chance to innovate with new trust signals (some are experimenting with things like verified buyer badges, AI analysis for suspicious patterns, or weighted ratings that account for reviewer reputation). The platforms that find ways to genuinely restore faith in their review systems will win back weary consumers. Those that don’t will see their communities drift away, bit by bit.

Importantly, not all platforms have given in to the dark side. A handful still refuse pay-for-play tactics, no paid reviews, no under-the-table boosting of rankings for advertisers.

These holdouts demonstrate that integrity in reviews is possible, even if it means slower growth in the short term.

In the end, the broken review economy is forcing a rebalance of how we decide what to trust. Buyers are adapting, finding new ways to cut through the noise. And the platforms that once thrived on being the ultimate source of truth in purchasing may have to rethink their approach if they want to stay relevant.

Trust, once lost, is hard to regain. The five-star system doesn’t shine as bright as it used to; perhaps it’s time for the next evolution in how we share and earn trust online.

            <div id="article-text">2025 was the year technology stopped being tomorrow’s promise and became today’s anchor. What began as a surge in generative AI and platform innovation two years prior crystallized this year into concrete shifts in how people work, governing bodies legislate, and markets invest. Across continents and industries, the arc of technology bent toward practical impact, regulatory reality, and economic weight!

At the heart of the year’s story was artificial intelligence’s jump from novelty to infrastructure. LLMs and multimodal models moved beyond demos into everyday workflows, influencing how documents are written, campaigns are conceived, products designed, and code generated.

Enterprises that once hesitated began deploying AI tools at scale, with early adopters reporting measurable productivity gains by integrating copilots into core processes, a trend visible in surveys showing widespread adoption among software professionals.

This editorial isn’t a chronicle of every press release.

It’s a reflection on how 2025, at the crossroads of technology, governance, and economic strategy, brought about a series of inflection points that will shape the next era of creation, competition, and control.

TNW City Coworking space - Where your best work happens

A workspace designed for growth, collaboration, and endless networking opportunities in the heart of tech.

OpenAI’s release of GPT-5 in August pushed the boundaries of what AI could do, delivering notable gains in coding, math, and multimodal understanding. But unlike the jaw-dropping debut of ChatGPT a couple years prior, this new generation of foundation models arrived to a more measured reception.

Tech leaders and investors had begun asking harder questions: beyond impressive demos, could these models drive real products and revenue?

Google’s answer was Gemini 3, launched in November as its “most intelligent model” and immediately woven into Google’s flagship product, Search. For the first time, an AI model upgrade wasn’t just about boastful leaderboard scores, it was about transforming user experience.

Typing a query into Google now often meant receiving an AI-generated synthesis instead of the familiar list of links, a sea change in how information is delivered. Google even unveiled a Gemini “agent” that could execute multi-step tasks like booking travel or organizing email, hinting at a future where AI acts more like a digital butler than a chatbox.

Anthropic’s Claude 4 model, for instance, gained a strong following among developers by expanding how much it could handle at once, processing entire codebases with tens of thousands of lines, rather than by producing viral one-liners.

AI grew up in 2025: it was still improving at breakneck speed, but it also had to earn its keep in real products and justify the billion-dollar bets fueling its rise.

Driving this AI explosion was a parallel leap in hardware. The hunger for AI computers in 2025 was insatiable, and chipmakers raced to deliver.

NVIDIA, whose GPUs had become the era’s essential infrastructure, rolled out its new Blackwell architecture with chips like the B200 that boasted up to 3× the training speed of its predecessor. Cloud data centers around the world scrambled to deploy these to keep up with demand from model training and inference.

Rival chipmakers weren’t idle either: AMD and a cadre of startups pushed innovative AI accelerators, while even Intel signaled ambitions to catch up, reportedly exploring an acquisition of AI chip designer SambaNova.

Perhaps most tellingly, tech giants themselves started designing silicon tailored for AI workloads, recognizing that owning the chip means owning the future of computing.

Beyond AI chips, consumer hardware saw its own milestones. After years of anticipation, augmented reality glasses and mixed-reality headsets finally had their moment, sort of.

Apple’s Vision Pro headset, unveiled in late 2023, reached select markets in 2024; by 2025 developers were crafting the first wave of immersive apps. However, mass adoption lagged due to the device’s sky-high price and bulky format.

Competitors like Meta’s Quest line offered cheaper VR headsets and modest improvements, but the “metaverse” hype of yesteryear largely fizzled out, users and investors had shifted their excitement to generative AI and tangible productivity tools.

Smartphones and laptops in 2025 continued incremental improvements (faster Apple M3/M4 chips, foldable screens becoming more common), yet it was clear the next paradigm shift in personal tech was still on the horizon.

Even so, one hardware frontier made concrete progress: quantum computing. Industry leaders like IBM and Google demonstrated prototype systems with ever-larger qubit counts and made strides in error correction, inching closer to viable quantum machines.

These advances, while esoteric to the public, underscored a broader theme, from AI accelerators to quantum chips, the machinery under the hood of tech was evolving rapidly to enable the software of tomorrow.

If 2025 proved anything, it’s that technology no longer operates above the law. This was the year regulators moved from intent to enforcement, with Europe leading the charge.

After years of debate, the EU’s Artificial Intelligence Act came into force, becoming the world’s first complex AI law. From February, certain “unacceptable risk” uses, such as social scoring and real-time biometric surveillance, were banned outright.

By August, transparency rules followed, forcing companies to label AI-generated content and comply with new obligations for general-purpose models. The signal was unmistakable: in Europe, the era of unchecked AI was over.

Companies now face audits, penalties, and real consequences if their systems cross legal or ethical lines, a regulatory moment European officials openly compared to GDPR’s impact on data privacy.

The pressure didn’t stop with AI. In 2025, regulators also went after the gatekeepers. The EU’s Digital Markets Act forced long-resistant changes from Big Tech, most notably when Apple opened the iPhone to third-party app stores and sideloading in Europe, dismantling a 15-year walled garden.

At the same time, enforcement of the Digital Services Act intensified. Platforms were scrutinized for how they handle disinformation, with companies like X warned or penalized during periods of geopolitical tension. In response, social networks expanded moderation teams, adjusted algorithms, and exposed more of their inner workings to researchers.

The US issued an AI executive order and signaled tougher enforcement through agencies like the FTC, while states stepped in, including New York’s law requiring mental-health warnings on addictive social features.

In China, new draft rules targeted AI systems designed for human-like interaction, tightening licensing and ideological oversight. By the end of the year, the freewheeling phase of tech disruption had given way to something more restrained. The question was no longer whether regulation would catch up, but how deeply it would reshape innovation itself.

The platform shake-up that began in 2023 gathered real momentum in 2025, as both companies and users adjusted to a post-pandemic, AI-saturated reality.

Nowhere was this clearer than in social media. Elon Musk’s X, which entered the decade with noise and bravado, found itself on the defensive. Meta’s Threads, initially dismissed after an early spike, steadily closed the gap, nearing parity with X in daily mobile users by mid-year.

X’s audience shrank as policy whiplash and leadership churn eroded confidence, and while its remaining users were still deeply engaged, the era of unquestioned Twitter dominance was over. Disenchanted users scattered across a fragmented landscape, from Meta’s polished Threads to decentralized alternatives like Bluesky and Mastodon, breaking the old Facebook–Instagram–Twitter equilibrium.

The recalibration extended well beyond social feeds.

Major platforms retooled around changing habits: Google reshaped Search around generative answers to fend off AI assistants and algorithmic discovery, while Microsoft pushed its Copilot deeper into Windows, Office, and Bing, betting on “AI inside” as a platform reset.

Everyday behavior shifted too. Smarter voice and chat assistants returned to daily use, handling emails, refunds, and scheduling with little friction. At the same time, screen fatigue set in. Digital-detox travel gained traction, and younger users gravitated toward apps that promised less algorithmic pressure and more human curation. Even streaming came full circle.

After years of fragmentation, providers began rebundling services, offering combined video, music, and gaming packages that looked suspiciously like cable TV reborn, a reminder that while technology moves forward, user preferences often move in cycles.

Amid the gains and momentum, 2025 also became a year of reckoning. As AI systems spread, society began grappling with their cultural and ethical cost. Creators who once marveled at generative tools started pushing back, arguing that their work had been absorbed without consent or compensation.

A wave of lawsuits moved through US courts, with authors accusing companies like OpenAI, Meta, and Google of scraping books and articles to train models. By year’s end, the message was unmistakable: if AI is built on human creativity, many believe its rewards can no longer flow in one direction alone.

Public trust in technology was also tested by a rise in malicious uses and misuses. In the financial domain, sophisticated deepfake scams caused real damage. The frequency of such incidents spiked sharply; cybersecurity firms reported a 3000% increase in deepfake-related fraud over two years, and authorities scrambled to educate businesses on new verification practices.

Misinformation continued to be a menace: during elections and conflicts, AI-generated fake images and videos spread on social media, forcing newsrooms to set up rapid-response fact-checking teams.

Encouragingly, 2025 also saw growth in countermeasures, from better deepfake detection algorithms to nascent standards for cryptographic content authentication (the Coalition for Content Provenance, including major publishers and tech platforms, expanded efforts to watermark authentic media).

Still, the information ecosystem remained fraught, as even savvy citizens found it ever harder to tell the truth from fabrication online.

And then there’s the human element: how all this tech is affecting everyday lives and livelihoods. Workplace AI adoption soared this year; tools like Microsoft 365 Copilot and a host of AI assistants became common on office desktops. Studies showed productivity boosts but also raised concerns about workers becoming overly reliant on AI suggestions.

Meanwhile, fears of automation resurfaced in certain sectors, for example, as chatbots took over more customer service and code-generation tools improved, professionals in call centers and junior programming positions wondered about long-term job security.

These anxieties fueled calls for new approaches to education and training, so that the workforce of 2030 will be prepared for more creative, complex tasks that AI can’t easily handle.

Lovable (Stockholm, Sweden) came as one of the most remarkable AI software stories of the year, for me. What began as an open-source project evolved into a commercial platform that lets users build fully functional websites and apps using plain-language prompts, no traditional coding required.

This approach, known in the industry as “vibe coding,” turns ideas into production-ready software simply by describing what you want in natural language.

Lovable’s growth in 2025 was extraordinary by any measure. Eight months after its launch, the company hit over $100 million in annual recurring revenue and raised a $200 million Series A at a roughly $1.8 billion valuation, making it one of Europe’s fastest-growing software startups ever.

By year’s end, Lovable had secured $330 million in Series B funding at about a $6.6 billion valuation, and was rapidly scaling globally.

What makes Lovable meaningful beyond the numbers is what it represents: a shift in how software is built. It demonstrated that AI can democratize development, giving power to non-technical founders, creators, and teams to go from concept to product without traditional engineering barriers.

In an industry long centered on specialized skills and team structures, Lovable’s rise suggested a future where natural language becomes the primary interface to software creation.

On a more hopeful note, 2025 showed signs of a maturing tech culture. Ethical design moved from talking point to practice. Major platforms began experimenting with limits, turning off infinite scroll for teens, adding prompts that nudged users to pause, and treating “time well spent” as a real metric rather than a slogan.

In AI, transparency gained ground. Under pressure from regulators and researchers, companies like OpenAI and Google disclosed more about how their models are trained and where they fall short.

Researchers formed new alliances to share safety techniques, and a second global AI Safety Summit brought dozens of countries together around questions of alignment and control.

None of it amounted to binding rules, but it marked a shift in tone: even the architects of powerful systems openly acknowledged the need for restraint.

Taken together, these moments made 2025 a turning point. For years, technology had surged ahead of the institutions meant to guide it. This year, that gap began to close.

The breakthroughs were real and transformative, but so were the responses to them: laws passed, norms reset, alliances formed. If 2024 was the year the world grasped the power of generative AI, 2025 was the year it began deciding how that power should be used.

The story of technology is no longer just about what can be built, but about how it fits into the lives it shapes, and who gets to decide that fit.

            <div id="article-text">My name is Alexandru Stan, and this article continues the dialogue I began following the acquisition of TNW.

Following the recent transaction, TNW Spaces remains with the Financial Times, while we continue the mission of the website, the events, and the global community.

We already have a dedicated team at tekpon operating the platform, events, and community initiatives. Our objective is to expand and strengthen the team as TNW accelerates its next chapter.

TNW is already a global media platform with millions of readers. We’re not starting over. We are building forward.

TNW City Coworking space - Where your best work happens

A workspace designed for growth, collaboration, and endless networking opportunities in the heart of tech.

Technology is entering a decisive stage: AI is reshaping workflows, distribution is shifting, capital is becoming more selective, and founders are expected to demonstrate value rather than potential.

The world doesn’t need more noise.
It needs clarity, execution, and access to trustworthy knowledge and people.

TNW will serve that need through editorial independence, real expertise, and community-built intelligence.

Success for TNW looks like this: more accurate understanding, faster access to verified knowledge, and direct pathways from insight to action.

I’ve been an entrepreneur since 2007, building in B2B SaaS, marketplaces, and scalable systems. I believe deeply in servant leadership. Without people, I am zero.

I lead two private networks grounded in practice rather than theory:

These groups ensure TNW remains rooted in lived experience, informed by operators, not commentators.

Our mission is to build the most trusted European tech media platform with global reach, focused on practical innovation, responsible scaling, and transparency.

We will continue to host events across Europe’s major capitals including Paris, London, Berlin, Amsterdam, and Monaco.

These will not be festivals. We are introducing a concept validated through tekpon events: curated gatherings built for meaningful relationships, deep content, and tangible business outcomes.

In 2026, we return to Amsterdam for a special edition centered on AI among other fields. We will explore technologies and strategies shaping the future of work and business:

The editorial focus remains European, while the audience is global.

AI is not a threat to publishing. It is the infrastructure of the next generation of content and knowledge.

At TNW, we will use AI to accelerate research, enable personalized intelligence, reduce noise and bias, and amplify high-quality human expertise. Technology assists. Human judgment remains central.

Because this moment in Europe matters.
Because founders here are ready to scale responsibly.
Because independent media with integrity is rare.
Because innovation deserves a platform built around people, not hype.

TNW will continue its legacy with a renewed emphasis on contribution, execution, and community built through trust.

If you are building, scaling, or researching the next wave of technology, I invite you to engage with us, contribute insights, and participate in shaping the conversation.

The next era begins now. Let’s shape it together.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Most engineering leaders cannot answer the one question their CFO is about to ask: “Can you prove this AI spend is changing outcomes, not just activity?”

Every December, roadmaps get locked, budgets get approved, and board decks are polished until everything looks precise and under control. Underneath, many CTOs and VPs are still working with partial visibility. They have a feel for their teams, but not a reliable view of how work moves through the system, how AI is really changing delivery, or where time and money actually go.

For a while, that was survivable. Experience, pattern recognition, and cheap capital covered the gaps. You could hire around bottlenecks, overstaff critical teams, or quietly pivot away from the messiest parts of the system. Then AI showed up and became the perfect distraction. Pilots, PoCs, Copilot seats, and “AI initiatives” created visible activity and bought time.

In 2026, that grace period ends. Boards and CFOs are shifting from “show me you are experimenting” to “show me measurable impact, this year.” Not because they stopped believing in AI, but because the market no longer rewards vague promises. Every AI dollar will need a traceable path to productivity, quality, or customer value.

If you run engineering, you probably recognise this scene. You present a slide with AI highlights. Adoption is up. Developers say they like the tools. You share a few anecdotes about faster coding and smoother reviews. Then the CFO asks a simple question: “Exactly how is this budget changing output and outcomes?”

TNW City Coworking space - Where your best work happens

A workspace designed for growth, collaboration, and endless networking opportunities in the heart of tech.

What is almost always missing is a clear breakdown of:

So the conversation slips back to learning curves, compounding benefits, and talent attraction. All true, but too soft for a tough budget review. That will not be enough.

AI vendors love task-level numbers. A coding task completed 55 percent faster looks impressive on a slide. But once you zoom out to teams and systems, the picture changes.

Large datasets across thousands of developers show a consistent pattern:

The problem is not the tools. It is the lack of a system for where the “extra” capacity goes.

Most organisations still frame AI productivity in terms of speed: more story points, more tickets, higher deployment frequency. That misses the bigger question:

How much of our engineering capacity goes to net new value versus maintenance, incidents, and rework, and is AI improving that mix?

High-level benchmarks are blunt but helpful. On average, about 45 percent of developer time is spent on maintenance, minor enhancements, and bug fixes rather than on genuinely new, customer-facing work. If AI helps you produce more code inside an unchanged system, you risk:

That is how you end up with impressive local metrics and a leadership team that still feels like engineering is slowing down.

If you want to walk into a 2026 budget conversation with objective evidence, you need to be deliberate about how AI-driven time savings are used. Two moves matter.

AI is already good at boilerplate, tests, documentation, and simple refactors. The trap is treating the saved time as unstructured “extra” capacity that disappears into the noise. Instead:

When teams systematically reduce technical debt and improve tests around critical flows, they cut future incidents and rework. Over a year, that frees more capacity for new work than shaving a few minutes off each ticket ever will.

2. Point AI at the ugly, high-friction work that commonly blows up roadmaps

The biggest productivity wins are not in everyday code generation. They are in:

These activities steal weeks or months of capacity and stall strategic initiatives. Using AI to understand legacy code faster, propose refactoring plans, generate migration scaffolding, and highlight recurring failure patterns can dramatically compress timelines for this work.

In parallel, there is real leverage upstream in the problem space. Teams that reach higher levels of AI adoption report better gains when they:

That reduces wasted builds and focuses effort on changes customers actually care about. The most significant gains do not come from replacing human creativity, but from amplifying it and aiming it at better-defined problems.

DORA metrics are not the enemy. Deployment frequency, lead time, MTTR, and change failure rate remain among the best signals we have for delivery performance. The risk is mistaking them for the whole picture.

Leading organisations are already expanding their scorecard to include:

In 2026, the question in the boardroom will shift from “Are we elite on DORA?” to “How much of our capacity is going into things customers notice, and is AI improving that mix or not?” To answer that cleanly, DORA is necessary but not sufficient. You need a way to connect AI usage, workflow, quality, and business outcomes across the system.

This is where engineering intelligence platforms move from a nice-to-have to mandatory. The organisations that win in 2026 will not do it with one more AI tool or one more disconnected dashboard. They will do it by pulling together data they already have but rarely use in one coherent view:

From there, leaders can answer the questions that actually matter:

Instead of defending AI spend with anecdotes, you walk in with:

That is the difference between “we believe in AI” and “here is how AI changed our delivery engine in measurable ways.”

To be ready for the more complex questions coming next year, use this planning cycle to do four things.

Do this, and you will not just have “AI activity” to show in 2026. You will have a credible, data-backed story from AI spend to business outcomes.

The leaders who thrive next year will not be the ones with the flashiest AI demos or the loudest “AI strategy” slide. They will be the ones who:

Engineering intelligence platforms is a key part of that shift. They give you the complex data to show where time and money go, how AI is really changing delivery, and whether your current pace is sustainable. The shift to data-backed engineering leadership is happening either way.

The gap in 2026 will be between teams still guessing and teams that can prove, in detail, how their engineering organisation works.
