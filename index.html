            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">KENNEDY SPACE CENTER, Florida—Preparations for the first human spaceflight to the Moon in more than 50 years took a big step forward this weekend with the rollout of the Artemis II rocket to its launch pad.

The rocket reached a top speed of just 1 mph on the four-mile, 12-hour journey from the Vehicle Assembly Building to Launch Complex 39B at NASA’s Kennedy Space Center in Florida. At the end of its nearly 10-day tour through cislunar space, the Orion capsule on top of the rocket will exceed 25,000 mph as it plunges into the atmosphere to bring its four-person crew back to Earth.

“This is the start of a very long journey,” said NASA Administrator Jared Isaacman. “We ended our last human exploration of the moon on Apollo 17.”

The Artemis II mission will set several notable human spaceflight records. Astronauts Reid Wiseman, Victor Glover, Christina Koch, and Jeremy Hansen will travel farther from Earth than any human in history. They won’t land. That distinction will fall to the next mission in line in NASA’s Artemis program.

But the Artemis II astronauts will travel more than 4,000 miles beyond the far side of the Moon (the exact distance depends on the launch date), setting up for a human spaceflight speed record during their blazing reentry over the Pacific Ocean a few days later. Koch will become the first woman to fly to the vicinity of the Moon, and Hansen will be the first non-US astronaut to do the same.

“We really are ready to go,” said Wiseman, the Artemis II commander, during Saturday’s rollout to the launch pad. “We were in a sim [in Houston] for about 10 hours yesterday doing our final capstone entry and landing sim. We got in T-38s last night and we flew to the Cape to be here for this momentous occasion.”

The rollout began around sunrise Saturday, with NASA’s Space Launch System rocket and Orion capsule riding a mobile launch platform and a diesel-powered crawler transporter along a throughway paved with crushed Alabama river rock. Employees, VIPs, and guests gathered along the crawlerway to watch the 11 million-pound stack inch toward the launch pad. The rollout concluded about an hour after sunset, when the crawler transporter’s jacking system lowered the mobile launch platform onto pedestals at Pad 39B.

The rollout keeps the Artemis II mission on track for liftoff as soon as next month, when NASA has a handful of launch opportunities on February 6, 7, 8, 10, and 11.

The big milestone leading up to launch day will be a practice countdown or Wet Dress Rehearsal (WDR), currently slated for around February 2, when NASA’s launch team will pump more than 750,000 gallons of super-cold liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen into the rocket. NASA had trouble keeping the cryogenic fluids at the proper temperature, then encountered hydrogen leaks when the launch team first tried to fill the rocket for the unpiloted Artemis I mission in 2022. Engineers implemented the same fixes on Artemis II that they used to finally get over the hump with propellant loading on Artemis I.

So, what are the odds NASA can actually get the Artemis II mission off the ground next month?

“We’ll have to have things go right,” said Matt Ramsey, NASA’s Artemis II mission manager, in an interview with Ars on Saturday. “There’s a day of margin there for weather. There’s some time after WDR that we’ve got for data reviews and that sort of thing. It’s not unreasonable, but I do think it’s a success-oriented schedule.”

The Moon has to be in the right position in its orbit for the Artemis II launch to proceed. There are also restrictions on launch dates to ensure the Orion capsule returns to Earth and reenters the atmosphere at an angle safe for the ship’s heat shield. If the launch does not happen in February, NASA has a slate of backup launch dates in early March.

Ars was at Kennedy Space Center for the rocket’s move to the launch pad Saturday. The photo gallery below shows the launcher emerging from the Vehicle Assembly Building, the same facility once used to stack Saturn V rockets during the Apollo Moon program. The Artemis II astronauts were also on hand for a question and answer session with reporters.

The first flight of astronauts on the SLS rocket and Orion spacecraft is running at least five years late. The flight’s architecture, trajectory, and goals have changed multiple times, and technical snags discovered during manufacturing and testing repeatedly shifted the schedule. The program’s engineering and budgetary problems are well documented.

But the team readying the rocket and spacecraft for launch has hit a stride in recent months. Technicians inside the Vehicle Assembly Building started stacking the SLS rocket in late 2024, beginning with the vehicle’s twin solid-fueled boosters. Then ground teams added the core stage, upper stage, and finally installed the Orion spacecraft on top of the rocket last October.

Working nearly around the clock in three shifts, it took about 12 months for crews at Kennedy to assemble the rocket and prepare it for rollout. But the launch campaign inside the VAB was remarkably smooth. Ground teams shaved about two months off the time it took to integrate the SLS rocket and Orion spacecraft for the Artemis I mission, which launched on the program’s first full-up unpiloted test flight in 2022.

“About a year ago, I was down here and we set the rollout date, and we hit it within a day or two,” said Matt Ramsey, NASA’s mission manager for Artemis II. “Being able to stay on schedule, it was a daily grind to be able to do that.”

Engineers worked through a handful of technical problems last year, including an issue with a pressure-assisted device used to assist the astronauts in opening the Orion hatch in the event of an emergency. More recently, NASA teams cleared a concern with caps installed on the rocket’s upper stage, according to Ramsey.

The most significant engineering review focused on proving the Orion heat shield is safe to fly. That assessment occurred in the background from the perspective of the technicians working on Artemis II at Kennedy.

The Artemis II team is now focused on activities at the launch pad. This week, NASA plans to perform a series of tests extending and retracting the crew access arm. Next, the Artemis II astronauts will rehearse an emergency evacuation from the launch pad. That will be followed by servicing of the rocket’s hydraulic steering system.

All of this leads up to the crucial practice countdown early next month. The astronauts won’t be aboard the rocket for the test, but almost everything else will look like launch day. The countdown will halt around 30 seconds prior to the simulated liftoff.

It took repeated tries to get through the Wet Dress Rehearsal for the Artemis I mission. There were four attempts at the countdown practice run before the first actual Artemis I launch countdown. After encountering hydrogen leaks on two scrubbed launch attempts, NASA performed another fueling test before finally successfully launching Artemis I in November 2022.

The launch team repaired a leaky hydrogen seal and introduced a gentler hydrogen loading procedure to overcome the problem. Hydrogen is an extremely efficient fuel for rockets, but its super-cold temperature and the tiny size of hydrogen molecules make it prone to leakage. The hydrogen feeds the SLS rocket’s four core stage engines and single upper stage engine.

“Artemis I was a test flight, and we learned a lot during that campaign getting to launch,” said Charlie Blackwell-Thompson, NASA’s Artemis II launch director. “The things that we’ve learned relative to how to go load this vehicle, how to load LOX (liquid oxygen), how to load hydrogen, have all been rolled in to the way in which we intend to load the Artemis II vehicle.”

NASA is hesitant to publicly set a target launch date until the agency gets through the dress rehearsal, but agency officials say a February launch remains feasible.

“We’ve held schedule pretty well getting to rollout today,” Isaacman said. “We have zero intention of communicating an actual launch date until we get through wet dress. But look, that’s our first window, and if everything is tracking accordingly, I know the teams are prepared, I know this crew is prepared, we’ll take it.”

“Wet dress is the driver to launch,” Blackwell-Thompson said. “With a wet dress that is without significant issues, if everything goes to plan, then certainly there are opportunities within February that could be achievable.”

One constraint that threw a wrench into NASA’s Artemis I launch campaign is no longer a significant factor for Artemis II. On Artemis I, NASA had to roll the rocket back to the Vehicle Assembly Building (VAB) after the wet dress rehearsal to complete final installation and testing on its flight termination system, which consists of a series of pyrotechnic charges designed to destroy the rocket if it flies off course and threatens populated areas after liftoff.

The US Space Force’s Eastern Range, responsible for public safety for all launches from Florida’s Space Coast, requires the flight termination system be retested after 28 to 35 days, a clock that started ticking last week before rollout. During Artemis I, technicians could not access the parts of the rocket they needed to in order to perform the retest at the launch pad. NASA now has structural arms to give ground teams the ability to reach parts higher up the rocket for the retest without returning to the hangar.

With this new capability, Artemis II could remain at the pad for launch opportunities in February and March before officials need to bring it back to the VAB to replace the flight termination system’s batteries, which still can’t be accessed at the pad.</div>

            <h2>The first new Marathon game in decades will launch on March 5</h2>
            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-01-19</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2026/01/bungies-delayed-marathon-revival-will-finally-launch-march-5/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">It’s been nearly three years now since Destiny maker (and Sony subsidiary) Bungie formally announced a revival of the storied Marathon FPS franchise. And it has been about seven months since the game’s original announced release date of September 23, 2025 was pushed back indefinitely after a reportedly poor response to the game’s first Alpha test.

But today, in a post on the PlayStation Blog, Bungie revealed that the new Marathon would finally be hitting PS5, Windows, and Xbox Series X|S on March 5, narrowing down the month-long March release window announced back in December.

Unlike Destiny 2, which transitioned to a free-to-play model in 2019, the new Marathon sells for $40 in a Standard Edition or a $60 Deluxe Edition that includes some digital rewards and cosmetics. That mirrors the pricing of the somewhat similar Arc Raiders, which recently hit 12 million sales in less than 12 weeks.

Unlike the original Marathon trilogy on the ’90s Macintosh—which closely followed on the single-player campaign corridors and deathmatch multiplayer of the original Doom—the new Marathon is described as a “PvPvE survival extraction shooter.” That means gameplay based around exploring distinct zones and scavenging for cosmetics and gear upgrades in exploratory missions alone or with up to two friends, then seeing those missions “break into fast-paced PvP combat” at a moment’s notice, according to the game’s official description.

A new preorder trailer expands on other more gameplay-focused videos showcasing the poisoned world of Tau Ceti IV and the six competing factions of highly customizable “runner shells” they’ll inhabit. Bungie has also revealed a scavenging-focused “Rook” option for players that want to queue up solo and join a match in progress with nothing but a starting kit.

“Instead of focusing on progression and questing and things of that sort, [Rook] is a mode where we make it easy for you to just kind of drop into a match that’s in progress and run about and try to scavenge as much as possible and get out with it, so that you can populate your vault a little bit more for future runs,” Game Director Joe Ziegler said in a recent video.

The Marathon revival project has faced its fair share of development troubles in recent years. That includes public accusations that early test gameplay included plagiarized artwork, leading the development team to announce a “thorough review of our in-game assets.” Internal plans to release the game in 2024 were reportedly pushed back and entire year amid pessimism among developers. More recently, the game got a new creative director in June, which isn’t exactly a sign of confidence that late in a long-running project.

After all that—and given a Bungie gaming pedigree that dates back to the original Marathon—it’s fair to say that the new Marathon is going to get more than its fair share of attention when it finally gets into players’ hands in just six weeks.</div>

            <h2>Signs point to a sooner-rather-than-later M5 MacBook Pro refresh</h2>
            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-01-19</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2026/01/signs-point-to-a-sooner-rather-than-later-m5-macbook-pro-refresh/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Mac power users waiting on new high-end MacBook Pro models may have been disappointed last fall, when Apple released an M5 upgrade for the low-end 14-inch MacBook Pro without touching the M4 Pro or Max versions of the laptop. But the wait for M5 Pro and M5 Max models may be nearing its end.

The tea-leaf readers at MacRumors noticed that shipping times for a handful of high-end MacBook Pro configurations have slipped into mid-to-late February, rather than being available immediately as most Mac models are. This is often, though not always, a sign that Apple has slowed down or stopped production of an existing product in anticipation of an update.

Currently, the shipping delays affect the M4 Max versions of both the 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pros. If you order them today, these models will arrive sometime between February 3 and February 24, depending on the configuration you choose; many M4 Pro versions are still available for same-day shipping, though adding a nano-texture display or upgrading RAM can still add a week or so to the shipping time.

Apple could choose to launch new Pro hardware on January 28, to go with the new Creator Studio subscription it announced last week. Aimed primarily at independent content creators that make their own video, audio, and images, the Creator Studio subscription bundles Final Cut Pro, Logic Pro, Pixelmator Pro, and enhancements for the Pages, Numbers, and Keynote apps (along with some other odds and ends) for $13 a month or $130 a year. None of these apps require a MacBook Pro, but many would benefit in some way from the additional CPU and GPU power, RAM, and storage available in Apple’s high-end laptops.

Of course, an imminent replacement isn’t the only reason why the shipping estimates for any given Mac might slip. Ongoing, AI-fueled RAM shortages could be causing problems, and Apple probably prioritizes production of the widely-used base-model M4 and M5 chips to the larger, more expensive, more complex Max models.

But the only other device in Apple’s lineup that offers the M4 Max and similar RAM configuration options is the high-end Mac Studio, which currently isn’t subject to the same shipping delays. That does imply that the delays are specific to the MacBook Pro—and one explanation for this is that the laptop is about to be replaced.

Virtually every Mac in Apple’s lineup is ready for an M5-series refresh. Only the low-end 14-inch MacBook Pro got an M5 upgrade last year, a relatively restrained rollout compared to the M3 and M4 generations—the M4 generation hit all the MacBook Pros, the iMac, and the Mac mini all at the same time. That’s left a lot of Macs eligible for an update at some point in 2026, including the Pros, the MacBook Airs, the Mac mini, the iMac, the Mac Studio, and the Mac Pro tower.

Apple has been known to skip Apple Silicon chip generations for some models in the past, so a handful of systems may stick with the M4 until the M6 rolls around. The MacBook Pros and Airs are reliably updated with each new chip generation, but the desktop Macs have all missed at least one chip update since the Apple Silicon era began.

Reporting from Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman also suggests that the Mac Pro may be on life support—even if an M5 Ultra chip arrives for the Mac Studio, there’s no guarantee that the Mac Pro (currently still rocking an M2 Ultra) will get the same chip.

On top of the existing Macs that we expect to see updated, Apple is rumored to be introducing an all-new Mac this year: a new entry-level model with an iPhone-class Apple A-series processor inside. This device is said to be a direct replacement for the M1 MacBook Air that Apple still sells for $599 via Walmart in the US, years after removing the model from its own retail and online stores.

Expect any replacement to share a lot in common with the old M1 Air, including its 13-inch screen size and (possibly) its paltry-by-modern-standards 8GB of RAM. But for $400 less than the starting price of the M4 MacBook Air, this low-end Mac would still serve a kind of customer that would otherwise have only Windows laptops and Chromebooks to consider.

The Walmart website currently has “low stock” of the M1 MacBook Air—it may be that we can also expect that new low-end MacBook sooner rather than later.</div>

            <h2>Elon Musk accused of making up math to squeeze $134B from OpenAI, Microsoft</h2>
            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-01-19</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2026/01/elon-musk-accused-of-making-up-math-to-squeeze-134b-from-openai-microsoft/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Elon Musk is going for some substantial damages in his lawsuit accusing OpenAI of abandoning its nonprofit mission and “making a fool out of him” as an early investor.

On Friday, Musk filed a notice on remedies sought in the lawsuit, confirming that he’s seeking damages between $79 billion and $134 billion from OpenAI and its largest backer, co-defendant Microsoft.

Musk hired an expert he has never used before, C. Paul Wazzan, who reached this estimate by concluding that Musk’s early contributions to OpenAI generated 50 to 75 percent of the nonprofit’s current value. He got there by analyzing four factors: Musk’s total financial contributions before he left OpenAI in 2018, Musk’s proposed equity stake in OpenAI in 2017, Musk’s current equity stake in xAI, and Musk’s nonmonetary contributions to OpenAI (like investing time or lending his reputation).

The eye-popping damage claim shocked OpenAI and Microsoft, which could also face punitive damages in a loss.

The tech giants immediately filed a motion to exclude Wazzan’s opinions, alleging that step was necessary to avoid prejudicing a jury. Their filing claimed that Wazzan’s math seemed “made up,” based on calculations the economics expert testified he’d never used before and allegedly “conjured” just to satisfy Musk.

For example, Wazzan allegedly ignored that Musk left OpenAI after leadership did not agree on how to value Musk’s contributions to the nonprofit. Problematically, Wazzan’s math depends on an imaginary timeline where OpenAI agreed to Musk’s 2017 bid to control 51.2 percent of a new for-profit entity that was then being considered. But that never happened, so it’s unclear why Musk would be owed damages based on a deal that was never struck, OpenAI argues.

It’s also unclear why Musk’s stake in xAI is relevant, since OpenAI is a completely different company not bound to match xAI’s offerings. Wazzan allegedly wasn’t even given access to xAI’s actual numbers to help him with his estimate, only referring to public reporting estimating that Musk owns 53 percent of xAI’s equity. OpenAI accused Wazzan of including the xAI numbers to inflate the total damages to please Musk.

“By all appearances, what Wazzan has done is cherry-pick convenient factors that correspond roughly to the size of the ‘economic interest’ Musk wants to claim, and declare that those factors support Musk’s claim,” OpenAI’s filing said.

Further frustrating OpenAI and Microsoft, Wazzan opined that Musk and xAI should receive the exact same total damages whether they succeed on just one or all of the four claims raised in the lawsuit.

OpenAI and Microsoft are hoping the court will agree that Wazzan’s math is an “unreliable… black box” and exclude his opinions as improperly reliant on calculations that cannot be independently tested.

Microsoft could not be reached for comment, but OpenAI has alleged that Musk’s suit is a harassment campaign aimed at stalling a competitor so that his rival AI firm, xAI, can catch up.

“Musk’s lawsuit continues to be baseless and a part of his ongoing pattern of harassment, and we look forward to demonstrating this at trial,” an OpenAI spokesperson said in a statement provided to Ars. “This latest unserious demand is aimed solely at furthering this harassment campaign. We remain focused on empowering the OpenAI Foundation, which is already one of the best resourced nonprofits ever.”

Wazzan is “a financial economist with decades of professional and academic experience who has managed his own successful venture capital firm that provided seed-level funding to technology startups,” Musk’s filing said.

OpenAI explained how Musk got connected with Wazzan, who testified that he had never been hired by any of Musk’s companies before. Instead, three months before he submitted his opinions, Wazzan said that Musk’s legal team had reached out to his consulting firm, BRG, and the call was routed to him.

Wazzan’s task was to figure out how much Musk should be owed after investing $38 million in OpenAI—roughly 60 percent of its seed funding. Musk also made nonmonetary contributions Wazzan had to weigh, like “recruiting key employees, introducing business contacts, teaching his cofounders everything he knew about running a successful startup, and lending his prestige and reputation to the venture,” Musk’s filing said.

The “fact pattern” was “pretty unique,” Wazzan testified, while admitting that his calculations weren’t something you’d find “in a textbook.”

Additionally, Wazzan had to factor in Microsoft’s alleged wrongful gains, by deducing how much of Microsoft’s profits went back into funding the nonprofit. Microsoft alleged Wazzan got this estimate wrong after assuming that “some portion of Microsoft’s stake in the OpenAI for-profit entity should flow back to the OpenAI nonprofit” and arbitrarily decided that the portion must be “equal” to “the nonprofit’s stake in the for-profit entity.” With this odd math, Wazzan double-counted value of the nonprofit and inflated Musk’s damages estimate, Microsoft alleged.

“Wazzan offers no rationale—contractual, governance, economic, or otherwise—for reallocating any portion of Microsoft’s negotiated interest to the nonprofit,” OpenAI’s and Microsoft’s filing said.

Perhaps most glaringly, Wazzan reached his opinions without ever weighing the contributions of anyone but Musk, OpenAI alleged. That means that Wazzan’s analysis did not just discount efforts of co-founders and investors like Microsoft, which “invested billions of dollars into OpenAI’s for-profit affiliate in the years after Musk quit.” It also dismissed scientists and programmers who invented ChatGPT as having “contributed zero percent of the nonprofit’s current value,” OpenAI alleged.

“I don’t need to know all the other people,” Wazzan testified.

Wazzan supposedly also did not bother to quantify Musk’s nonmonetary contributions, which could be in the thousands, millions, or billions based on his vague math, OpenAI argued.

Even Musk’s legal team seemed to contradict Wazzan, OpenAI’s filing noted. In Musk’s filing on remedies, it’s acknowledged that the jury may have to adjust the total damages. Because Wazzan does not break down damages by claims and merely assigns the same damages to each individual claim, OpenAI argued it will be impossible for a jury to adjust any of Wazzan’s black box calculations.

“Wazzan’s methodology is made up; his results unverifiable; his approach admittedly unprecedented; and his proposed outcome—the transfer of billions of dollars from a nonprofit corporation to a donor-turned competitor—implausible on its face,” OpenAI argued.

At a trial starting in April, Musk will strive to convince a court that such extraordinary damages are owed. OpenAI hopes he’ll fail, in part since “it is legally impossible for private individuals to hold economic interests in nonprofits” and “Wazzan conceded at deposition that he had no reason to believe Musk ‘expected a financial return when he donated… to OpenAI nonprofit.’”

“Allowing a jury to hear a disgorgement number—particularly one that is untethered to specific alleged wrongful conduct and results in Musk being paid amounts thousands of times greater than his actual donations—risks misleading the jury as to what relief is recoverable and renders the challenged opinions inadmissible,” OpenAI’s filing said.

Wazzan declined to comment. xAI did not immediately respond to Ars’ request to comment.</div>

            <h2>Asus confirms its smartphone business is on indefinite hiatus</h2>
            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-01-19</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2026/01/asus-confirms-its-smartphone-business-is-on-indefinite-hiatus/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">An unconfirmed report early this month suggested Asus was pulling back on its smartphone plans, but the company declined to comment at the time. Asus chairman Jonney Shih has now confirmed the wind-down of its smartphone business during an event in Taiwan. Instead, Asus will focus on AI products like robots and smart glasses.

Shih addressed the company’s future plans during a 2026 kick-off event in Taiwan, as reported by Inside. “Asus will no longer add new mobile phone models in the future,” said Shih (machine translated).

So don’t expect a new Zenfone or ROG Phone from Asus in 2026. That said, very few phone buyers were keeping tabs on the latest Asus phones anyway, which is probably why Asus is throwing in the towel. Shih isn’t saying Asus won’t ever release a new phone, but the company will take an “indefinite wait-and-see” approach. Again, this is a translation and could be interpreted in multiple ways.

The Zenfone line might not be missed—its claim to fame was being slightly smaller and cheaper than competing devices, but Asus’ support and update policy were lightyears behind the market leaders. The ROG Phone line has been prominent in the gaming phone niche, offering the latest chipsets with active cooling, multiple USB-C ports, game controller accessories, blinking lights, and even a headphone jack. However, ROG Phones are even more expensive than Samsung’s flagship devices, with the most recent ROG Phone 9 Pro starting at $1,200. Apparently, the market of those who aren’t happy gaming on the latest iPhone or Samsung Galaxy is miniscule.

Existing Asus devices should continue to get updates, but Asus never took the lead there. The lavishly expensive ROG Phone 9 Pro is only guaranteed two OS updates and five years of security patches. The most recent Zenfones are also only eligible for two Android version updates, but they get just four years of security support.

Shih’s comments imply that Asus won’t get back into the phone game unless something changes, and that’s not likely. Asus is not the first OEM to drop phone plans, and this is a continuation of a trend that has been underway for years as people upgrade phones less often.

Asus used to be a major player in the Android device ecosystem, offering myriad phones, tablets, phones that turned into tablets, and tablets that turned into PCs (sort of). The rapidly expanding market and advancing technology in the late 2000s and early 2010s left room for companies like Asus to operate alongside bigger OEMs like Samsung and Apple. Those were the days when every smartphone preference was served, from keyboarded sliders, to devices with integrated projectors, to the flat slab phones that eventually won out.

Today, smartphones have become a mature technology, and there simply isn’t as much room for improvement year-to-year. Combine that with rising prices, and people are apt to keep their devices longer. The continued rise of Chinese OEMs like Vivo, Xiaomi, and Huawei also makes it more difficult for niche players—particularly those focused on markets outside the US—to earn money designing and manufacturing a new smartphone every year. And as soon as you stop doing that, other brands are faster and more well-supported when the time does come to pick up a new phone.

So far, no Android device maker that has taken a break from releasing phones has ever ramped back up. Just ask LG, which once traded blows with hometown rival Samsung in smartphones. LG’s mobile division lost money for years, leading it to scale back its release schedule in 2019. At the time, the company was adamant it would release new phones when it had a good reason. A few years later, LG’s mobile division called it quits.

The possible end of Asus phones further narrows the market, leaving phone buyers with fewer choices. That doesn’t matter to Asus, though, which is a company that exists to make money. While announcing an indefinite pause in smartphone releases, Shih also noted that the company saw a 26.1 percent increase in revenue for 2025, thanks in large part to a doubling of its AI server business. So Asus is focusing on that part of the market. Maybe that’s not the best long-term strategy, but neither is losing money on smartphones.</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Currently, Microsoft’s long-running Cloud Gaming service is limited to players that have a Microsoft’s Game Pass subscription. Now, new reporting suggests Microsoft is planning to offer non-subscribers access to game streams paid for by advertising in the near future, but only in extremely limited circumstances.

The latest wave of rumors was set off late last week when The Verge’s Tom Warren shared an Xbox Cloud Gaming loading screen with a message mentioning “1 hour of ad supported playtime per session.” That leaked message comes after Windows Central reported last summer that Microsoft has been “exploring video ads for free games for quite some time,” à la the two-minute sponsorships that appear before free-tier game streams on Nvidia’s GeForce Now service.

Don’t get your hopes up for easy, free, ad-supported access to the entire Xbox Cloud Gaming library, though. Windows Central now reports that Microsoft will be using ads merely to slightly expand access to its “Stream your own game” program. That program currently offers subscribers to the Xbox Game Pass Essentials tier (or higher) the privilege of streaming versions of some of the Xbox games they’ve already purchased digitally. Windows Central’s unnamed sources suggest a “session-based ad-supported access tier” to stream those purchased games will be offered to non-subscribers as soon as “this year.”

That’s a moderately useful option for cloud-curious Xbox players that might not be willing to take the plunge on a monthly subscription, we suppose. But it also feels like Microsoft could come up with some more imaginative ways to use Cloud Gaming to reach occasional players in new ways.

What’s stopping Microsoft from offer streaming players a 30-minute timed demo stream of any available Xbox Cloud Gaming title—perhaps in exchange for watching a short ad, or perhaps simply as an Xbox Live Arcade-style sales juicing tactic? Or why not offer discounted access to a streaming-only Game Pass subscription for players willing to watch occasional ads, like Netflix? Microsoft could even let players spend a couple of bucks to rent a digital copy of the title for a few days, much as services like iTunes do for newer films.

Those are just a few ideas off the top of our heads. And they all feel potentially more impactful than using ads as a way to let Xbox players stream copies of games they already purchased.

Back in 2019, we noted how Stadia’s strictly buy-before-you-play streaming business model limited the appeal of what ended up as a doomed cloud-gaming experiment. Microsoft should take some lessons from Google’s failure and experiment with new ways to use streaming to reach players that might not have access to the latest high-end hardware for their gaming experiences.</div>

            <div id="article-text">The future moguls of corporate America aren’t living like the new money princes in F. Scott Fitzgerald’s “The Great Gatsby.” Instead, today’s aspiring tycoons are pursuing a different kind of luxury: a monastic purity through abstinence.

For Mahir Laul, founder of HR software startup Velric, the typically youthful whirlwind of sex and romance takes a backseat to Slack notifs and fundraising rounds. “There’s two things that I care about the most: the gym and my work,” Laul told Business Insider in an interview. “I am obsessed with work. My love life is in the gutters.”

With so much pressure on building the next tech unicorn, Laul says most of his fellow entrepreneurs are in the same boat — a lifestyle that doesn’t leave much room for romance, casual or otherwise.

“The opportunity cost is really high,” Annie Liao, founder of AI education company Build Club told BI. “Every night you spent out is time you could have spent building your startup.” She told the publication her San Francisco roommates are in the same boat. To the future new money of America, dating apps are a “big, big distraction,” the founder said.

Those who have paddled into the dating pool say they did so long before the days of building. Now that they’re founders, their long-standing relationships apparently come in handy in the business world.

“Being in a relationship is really helpful for building the company,” said Yang Fan Yun, cofounder of Composite, a company peddling in AI agents for web browsers. Yun told BI he met his current girlfriend early into his education at Stanford. Now that he’s in builder mode, he finds his girlfriend comes in handy by helping with things like product testing.

“You’ve always heard the mentality, ‘behind every successful man, there’s the right woman,&#39;” Laul told BI. “Rather than looking for hookups, I tend to look for someone as a life partner. But it’s been difficult.”

Avaricious chastity isn’t the only thing separating tech founders from their generational peers. The same motivations fuel a thriving sober movement, as well as a clinical relationship to food.

All in all, it’s a strange bargain for the would-be Rockefellers of the 21st century. In a calculated pursuit of wealth and status, they’ve abandoned the very pleasures that once defined life on the top rung. It raises an obvious question for those of us further down: if this is what the good life looks like, then what’s the point?

            <h2>Inventor Building AI-Powered Suicide Chamber</h2>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The inventor of a controversial suicide pod is making sure his device keeps up with the times by augmenting it with AI tech — which, we regret to inform you, is not merely some sort of dark joke.

“One of the parts to the device which hadn’t been finished, but is now finished, is the artificial intelligence,” the inventor, Philip Nitschke, told the Daily Mail in a new interview.

Named the Sarco pod after the ancient sarcophagus, the euthanasia chamber, first built in 2019, has been championed by the pro-assisted dying organization The Last Resort. In 2024, it was used to facilitate the suicide of a 64-year-old woman in Switzerland. The 3D-printed pod is activated when the person seeking to take their own life presses a button, filling the sealed, futuristic-looking coffin with nitrogen that causes the user to lose consciousness and “peacefully” pass away within a few minutes.

To date, the woman’s death in Switzerland is the only case of the Sarco pod seeing real-world action. Soon after she died, Swiss authorities showed up at the sylvan cabin where the pod was located and arrested the late Florian Willet, then co-president of Last Resort, who was supervising her death, on suspicion of aiding and abetting a suicide. He was ultimately released two months later.

Assisted dying is technically legal in Switzerland, but only if the person seeking suicide is deemed to have the mental capacity to make the decision, and only if they carry out the suicide themselves, rather than a third-party.

That last bit is why the patient presses the button to activate the chamber, a workaround that stands on legally shaky ground as it is (hence Willet’s arrest). Even more contestable is determining whether the patient is capable of making their mortal decision — which, of course, is where AI enters the picture.

As Nitschke was designing a “Double Dutch” version of the Sarco pod that would allow couples to die together, he stumbled on the idea of using AI to administer a psychiatric “test” to determine their mental capacity. If they pass the AI’s judgment, it activates the “power to switch on the Sarco.”

“That part wasn’t working when we first used the device,” Nitschke told the Daily Mail, referring to the 64-year-old woman’s death.

“Traditionally, that’s done by talking to a psychiatrist for five minutes, and we did that,” he explained. “She had a rather traditional assessment of mental capacity through a Dutch psychiatrist.”

“But with the new Double Dutch, we’ll have the software incorporated,” Nitschke continued, “so you’ll have to do your little test online with an avatar, and if you pass that test, then the avatar tells you you’ve got mental capacity.”

Passing the test will power on the Sarco for the next 24 hours, during which a person or couple can climb in and press the button to end it all. If they miss the day-long window, they’ll have to take the AI-administered test all over again.

How this will actually work in practice is as questionable as the promises of AI itself. AI models are prone to hallucinating, are alarmingly sycophantic, and have frequently failed when deployed in medical scenarios. Entrusting the tech to give the go-ahead to someone killing themselves — especially as AI chatbots are under the microscope for seemingly encouraging many adults and teenagers to take their own lives in cases of so-called AI psychosis — sounds like an ethical disaster waiting to happen.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">NASA’s Moon rocket has made it to its launchpad.

On Saturday, the towering assembly — comprising the enormous Space Launch System (SLS) rocket and a new Orion spacecraft — rode atop a behemoth moving platform called a crawler-transporter, inching its way at around one mile per hour from its Vehicle Assembly Building on one side of the Kennedy Space Center to its launchpad over four miles away. The trek lasted until nightfall, a small test of patience for what is a lunar mission years in the making: Artemis II.

“This is the start of a very long journey,” said Jared Isaacman, NASA’s new administrator, told reporters at the scene of the rocket’s launchpad journey, as quoted by The New York Times.

When — or if — the rocket launches, the ten-day Artemis II mission will see a crew of four astronauts visit the Moon for the first time in more than half a century. Or at least its orbital real estate: the astronauts won’t land on the lunar surface yet — that part comes in the following mission, Artemis III — but will instead closely fly around the rocky body before returning to Earth, a stunning achievement in its own right. One of the mission’s key objectives will be to test the spacecraft’s life support system, paving the way for an actual touchdown.

Still, there’s quite a bit of elbow grease ahead before NASA is even willing to announce a hard launch date. Now that the rocket’s on the pad, engineers will conduct what’s known as a wet dress rehearsal, loading its propellant tanks with over 700,000 gallons of super-chilled liquid propellant and running through a mock launch countdown, stopping short of actually igniting the SLS’s RS-25 engines. Afterwards, all of the propellant will be drained from the rocket, and from there, NASA will assess how the spacecraft performed. (It’s worth mentioning here that the previous Artemis I mission, the uncrewed dry-run for Artemis II, was delayed by the discovery of a leaky propellant seal.)

The earliest launch window is between February 6 and February 11. If that window is missed, then the next one to open up will be in March.

The commander of the mission is NASA astronaut Reid Wiseman, who will be joined by his colleagues Victor Glover and Christina Koch, as well as Canadian Space Agency astronaut Jeremy Hansen. Glover will be the first Black man to fly by the Moon, Koch the first woman, and Hansen the first non-American, the NYT noted. Altogether, the quartet will be the first people to fly to the Moon since Gene Cernan and Harrison Schmitt in the Apollo 17 mission in 1972.

The good feelings over Artemis II will at least temporarily subside questions over the fate of Artemis III — the mission that’s slated to see astronauts actually step on the lunar surface — which is looking dicey as there’s significant doubt over whether the spacecraft chosen to make the lunar landing, SpaceX’s Starship, will be ready in time.

            <h2>Cybertruck Sales Show Stomach-Churning Drop</h2>
            <p><strong>Futurism | 2026-01-19</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://futurism.com/advanced-transport/cybertruck-sales-2025">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Tesla’s “apocalypse-proof” Cybertruck is continuing to experience a near-cataclysmic plunge in sales that seems impossible to recover from.

According to a new analysis of Cox Automotive data by InsideEVs, the unorthodox electric pickup truck suffered the steepest drop in sales by volume of any EV sold in the US in 2025, capping off a disastrous year in which every quarter seemed to bring more record-setting Cybertruck lows.

For context, in 2024 — the first full year of the Cybertruck being on the market — Tesla sold around 39,000 of the notoriously unreliable pickups. That’s a figure that isn’t even in the same planet as CEO Elon Musk’s up-front boast that the automaker would sell up to half a million of these every year.

The year following, any hope that it would be a late-blooming success story went up in smoke like a wrecked EV. A pitiful tally of just 20,200 Cybertrucks were sold in all of 2025, and that shortfall of around 19,000 sales, representing a near 50 percent collapse, is the largest sales drop of an EV on sale in the US, according to InsideEV. (And that’s without getting into how Musk reportedly sold Cybertrucks to his own companies to juice sales figures, so the real picture may be even worse.)

To be fair to the Cybertruck, its first year of sales had some pretty good numbers for what remains a fairly niche market of electric pickups, regardless of the fact that it was still drastically short of Musk’s typically overly-optimistic projections — so it had a higher bar to fall from than most.

Still, the cratering sales didn’t come out of nowhere. Earning a reputation for being unreliable rustbuckets, the Cybertruck has been recalled ten times for issues as serious and embarrassing as its accelerator pedal getting stuck in the down position and losing power while driving. Add to that the recalls for its stainless steel body panels flying off because they were held on with crummy glue — and another glue recall for its lightbar attachments, too — and it becomes unclear whether the trucks which Musk frequently hyped as capable of surviving the post-apocalypse would even be a reliable pick to survive a trip to the Tesla Diner.

It also certainly didn’t help that Musk spent all of last year speed-running becoming one of the most hated men in America with his espousal of far-right politics and his hands-on role in gutting the federal government through his pet project DOGE, tanking Tesla’s reputation with it. And out of all the EV automaker’s cars, the Cybertruck is the one most closely associated with Musk’s personal brand and vision.

Perhaps Musk’s pride in the Cybertruck is why it hasn’t landed on the chopping block yet. As Electrek noted, Ford’s EV pickup, the F-150 Lightning, comfortably outsold the Cybertruck last year — and it got canned for not selling enough.

            <div id="article-text">An Amazon fulfillment center in Texas became a murder scene after a dispute between co-workers spiraled into a shooting that left one man dead and two others implicated in his murder.

The incident unfolded just after 10 p.m. on January 10 at a San Antonio Amazon facility located at U.S. Highway 90 and Loop 1604, local news station WOAI reports. Two Amazon workers, Johnny Bermea II and one unidentified man, had a long running argument stemming from high school and decided to fight each other during a scheduled work break to settle it.

The unknown employee had rallied local friends for backup, unbeknownst to Bermea; one of those friends, David Perez Morales Jr., exited a vehicle and allegedly fired a gun and shortly left the scene with another man, Jamari McKillion, who’s accused of driving the getaway vehicle.

Bermea was injured but stable after the shooting but another Amazon worker, Katrael Delosier, was left dead. Police linked McKillion, who worked at another nearby Amazon facility, to the shooting via video footage, cell phone data, and eyewitness statements, and that led to them fingering Morales as well.

McKillion and Morales are now facing murder charges for the shooting death of Delosier.

This isn’t the first murder at an Amazon warehouse. In June 2022, a man shot and killed a female Amazon worker in a Mississippi warehouse and then fled into Tennessee, where was he was killed in a shootout with Memphis police officers. In a separate incident in South Carolina in December 2022, two Amazon workers got into a dispute that led to one of them allegedly shooting the other and committing murder.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">On the campaign trail leading up to his election in 2024, Donald Trump made a plenty of bizarre promises that have fallen by the wayside. Arguably the strangest one he’s still harping about? Greenland — a massive island in the Arctic Ocean, currently a territory of Denmark, that he desperately wants to seize.

Geopolitical analysts and pundits have spilled plenty of ink over the past year trying to come up with some rational explanation for Trump’s obsession with the idea. One of the simplest, the New York Times suggests — yet somehow the most cynical — has to do with the scientific certainty that Greenland’s ice will soon melt away.

From September 2024 to September 2025, Greenland lost a staggering 105 billion metric tons of ice, according to researchers at the Danish Meteorological Institute. Between 1985 and 2022, Greenland’s ice sheet has shrunk by some 2,000 square miles. These trends are sure to continue in the years to come.

Beneath all that ice and permafrost is a veritable treasure trove of minerals like graphite, zinc, and rare earths. Basically, as the climate warms and Greenland’s ice melts, more and more of those minerals will become available for extraction.

In a nakedly empire-building type of way, in other words, Greenland makes perfect sense. The only problem? Publicly, Trump disparages the very notion of climate change — meaning that if really does understand the wealth of resources that the phenomenon is opening up in colder parts of the world, he’s fibbing to his base for jaded political reasons.

“His fixation on Greenland is an admission that climate change is real,” John Conger, an advisor to the Center for Climate and Security told the NYT.

If Trump or his advisors really are intrigued by Greenland because they’re anticipating a thawing world, that puts them in good company with Trump’s longstanding allies in Russia, where the ruling oligarchy is said to be banking on a similar strategy for the country’s immense frozen expanses.

If it sounds convoluted, it’s only because other explanations for Trump’s North Atlantic fixation just don’t add up.

As economic historian and analyst Adam Tooze explains, the US has a long-standing Cold War treaty with Denmark giving the US military carte blanche to do whatever it wants on Greenland’s territory. As such, there’s no national security justification for why the US needs to own Denmark outright.

“If Greenland isn’t currently adequately defended, it might be to do with the fact that America has completely run down multiple military bases it used to maintain on Greenland during the Cold War,” Tooze said on a recent episode of his podcast Ones and Tooze.

Oil — the classic raison d’être for US intervention on foreign soil — also doesn’t apply here. (Nor Venezuela, for that matter.)

In 2021, the governing body of Greenland stopped granting oil exploration licenses, the NYT notes, due to “climate considerations, environmental considerations and economic common sense.” That news came after 50 years of unsuccessful attempts to strike black gold in the icy waters off the island’s coast, meaning oil is a very unlikely motivation.

At the end of the day, we probably won’tknow the administration’s true motivations for Greenland unless they actually pull the trigger — though if Venezuela is any indication, a straight answer is far from guaranteed.

            <div id="article-text">The AI industry entered 2025 with strong momentum.

There were 49 startups that raised funding rounds worth $100 million or more in 2024, per our count at TechCrunch; three companies raised more than one “mega-round,” and seven companies raised rounds that were $1 billion in size or larger.

The industry didn’t slow down in 2025. While less companies raised rounds larger than $1 billion, four — Anthropic raised two rounds over $1 billion — significantly more companies raised multiple rounds compared to 2024, eight.

How will 2026 compare? Elon Musk’s xAI announced a $20 billion Series E round and Sam Altman’s brain computer interface startup Merge Labs raised a $250 million seed round (with OpenAI as the lead investor) in the first few weeks of 2026, so signs point to another strong year. Of course, it’s still early; we’ll be watching to see if the momentum continues.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Meta’s enormous bet on virtual reality ended last week, with the company reportedly laying off roughly 1,500 employees from its Reality Labs division — about 10% of the unit’s staff — and shutting down several VR game studios, according to The Wall Street Journal. It’s a huge reversal for a company that, just four years ago, staked its entire identity on the concept.

As industry watchers might remember, Facebook rebranded itself as Meta in 2021, promising to usher in a new era of technology led by VR devices.

In part, the decision was a bet on Gen Z’s preference to socialize in online games like Fortnite and Roblox as opposed to traditional social media apps. The change also helped Meta distance itself from the negativity surrounding its Facebook brand. Over the years, the brand had been damaged by data privacy scandals like Cambridge Analytica; reports from Facebook whistleblower Frances Haugen, who shared documents indicating Facebook knew of its negative impacts on children and teens; Congressional hearings over Facebook’s digital surveillance; its role in the spread of misinformation; its monopolistic practices, and more.

Meta’s vision at the time was that the metaverse would be the next big social platform, where users connected in a virtual world via Meta’s Horizon Worlds app and played games on their VR headsets.

Fast-forward, and the metaverse has effectively been abandoned in favor of AI.

According to CNBC, some of the casualties include studios making VR titles inside Meta, like Armature Studio (“Resident Evil 4 VR“), Twisted Pixel (“Marvel’s Deadpool VR“), and Sanzaru (“Asgard’s Wrath). Meanwhile, the VR fitness app Supernatural, which Meta acquired in 2023 for $400 million, will no longer produce new content and will move into “maintenance mode.” Camouflaj, the studio behind the “Batman: Arkham Shadow” VR game, has also been impacted by layoffs, as reported by GeekWire.

And last week, The Verge noted that Meta’s program to bring VR to work, Workrooms, is shutting down, as well.

The news follows an earlier Bloomberg report from December, which said that Meta was slashing the virtual reality department’s budget by up to 30%. Around the same time, Meta announced that it was pausing its program to share its Meta Horizon operating system, which runs on its Quest-branded VR headsets, with other third-party headset device makers.

Unlike the news of Meta’s rebrand, the deprioritization of the company’s metaverse efforts should come as no surprise — the division lost money at an excessive rate, worrying investors, and had never turned a profit.

In total, the company had funneled some $73 billion into Reality Labs. To put that into context, you’d have to spend $1 million per day for 200 years to match that kind of spending.

Besides being overhyped by investors and analysts alike, initial versions of the metaverse were just bad products. The goofy, soulless avatars didn’t even have legs, and one metaverse selfie of Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg was so bad it even became a viral meme. In short, Meta was overpromising a future while its product still under-delivered. It was a failure of the “build in the open” model, where early tech products are shipped to consumers in hopes of getting feedback that can be used to iterate.

That model works when customers are actively interested in a technology. But in the case of the metaverse, there was only middling consumer demand. Though Meta quickly gained a majority share of the VR market with its Oculus headsets, the headsets saw declining sales. Last spring, Counterpoint Research noted that global VR headset shipments had fallen by 12% year-over-year in 2024, which was their third consecutive year of declines. Meta had accounted for 77% of those 2024 headset shipments.

Meta, betting on the “if you build it, they will come” strategy, was more interested in the profits that could be made from running its own platform for apps and games than whether or not consumers even wanted these so-called face computers.

Specifically, Zuckerberg was looking for a way to bypass the ability of Apple and Google to tap into Meta’s revenue through their app stores.

“This period has…been humbling, because as big of a company as we are, we’ve also learned what it is like to build for other platforms. And living under their rules has profoundly shaped my views on the tech industry,” Zuckerberg said in a keynote speech at the company’s Facebook Connect 2021 event, referencing the Apple-Google duopoly. “I’ve come to believe that the lack of choice and high fees are stifling innovation, stopping people from building new things, and holding back the entire internet economy.”

He proposed that the metaverse could grow to a billion people in the next decade, hosting “hundreds of billions” of dollars in digital commerce. Analysts like McKinsey & Co. and investment bank Citi backed up this questionable forecast with their own heady estimates of the metaverse becoming a multi-trillion-dollar platform by 2030.

Meta may have had dollar signs in its eyes, but the apps built for the metaverse weren’t being adopted in massive numbers, at least for a company of Meta’s size.

Though there’s no external visibility into Meta’s own VR app store, you can look at Meta’s apps with iOS and Android counterparts as a proxy for adoption. According to modeled estimates from app intelligence provider Apptopia, the Meta Horizon app has been downloaded 60.4 million times globally and 39.8 million times in the U.S. since May 2018. A better estimate for adoption, however, is its app activity.

From a U.S. panel, Apptopia has figures for the average sessions per daily active user in the U.S., which grew from 3.49 in January 2023 to 4.93 in January 2026. While that’s still a high-water mark for the app, it may not have been enough for Meta.

For comparison, outside of VR, Meta now has over 3.5 billion daily active users across its social apps Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, and Messenger.

Of course, had this all succeeded, Meta would have created a new social empire, built on the back of VR gaming — not unlike Facebook’s early days as a social network, when partners like Zynga — whose games included Farmville, and Words with Friends — drove double-digit revenue streams for Facebook. (Ultimately, Facebook’s 30% cut of virtual goods sales, combined with restrictive platform policies, drove Zynga to launch its own gaming portal and pivot to mobile.)

But this time, Zuckerberg telegraphed his desire to tap into developer revenue far too soon. Meta might have had a better shot at attracting developers to build for VR if it promised to undercut Apple or Google’s standard 30% fees, or those of other gaming platforms. Instead, Meta did the opposite: it charged more.

Even before VR became a sizable platform worth investing in, Meta announced its plans to take a whopping 47.5% of the sales of digital assets within Horizon Worlds, consisting of a 30% hardware platform fee and another 17.5% fee for Horizon Worlds itself. Creators, unsurprisingly, were not happy.

As bad, Meta wasn’t building the metaverse with user safety as a top priority. As with its rush to scale its social network, the company tended to be reactive rather than proactive about safety features. For instance, the company only rolled out its “Personal Boundary” feature, which put a buffer between avatars, after reports that users were experiencing sexual harassment in the metaverse. In some cases, users had even engaged in virtual rape and gang rape in Meta’s Horizon Worlds. Meta later dialed back the safety feature a bit by adjusting the Personal Boundary to only default to “on” when a user is engaging with “non-friends” in the metaverse and allowing users to switch it off entirely.

In May 2022, TechCrunch asked a Meta rep to detail its support measures for Horizon Worlds. The company described several tools, including blocking and reporting features, a “safe zone” button for users to instantly block and mute others, and a feature to temporarily remove disruptive people from venues that was built in response to user feedback. Despite outlining these tools, Meta declined to say what sort of actions it would take to address individual bad actors’ behavior.

At the time, users told TechCrunch that those who faced abuse in the metaverse would often react with an obvious move: instead of recording the abuse, they would take off their headset and take a break from VR. But when they returned, their harasser would still appear in their list of recent encounters, and it was too late to submit a report of the abuse with the video and audio attached.

These types of scenarios were seemingly not thought through from the start, and detailed policies around what constitutes abuse didn’t exist. When a metaverse code of conduct was later published, it still didn’t detail any consequences beyond saying Meta would “take action on users.”

Also around this time, Meta declined to share the makeup of its team building the metaverse with TechCrunch. (But if we had to bet, we’d guess there weren’t as many women on the project as men. This would reflect the makeup of Meta overall, so it’s not a bad bet!)

Another nail in the proverbial coffin for the metaverse was the success of Meta’s Ray-Ban AR glasses, which have seen increased consumer interest in recent months. With features like the ability to record hands-free, stream music, and chat with Meta AI, the glasses began to outsell traditional Ray-Bans in some retail stores in 2024. The company is now considering doubling the output of the glasses to meet consumer demand, Bloomberg reported this week.

With an eye on AI, the company more recently introduced Ray-Ban Display last year, which are similar smart glasses that also include a display for apps, alerts, and directions on the right lens. The company has since paused its international plans for this product, citing “unprecedented demand.” (Or rather, overly conservative inventory forecasting.)

With other companies, including OpenAI, Amazon, and various startups, looking to hardware AI devices as the next potential computing platform, VR seems even more of a dated relic of a vision for the web that never came to pass.

Combined, these factors, and particularly the adoption of AI as a possible app platform, make it hard for Meta to continue to justify spending on VR. Instead, Meta will focus on the products that have potential, like its Ray Ban and AI glasses, AI app’s growth, and large language models.

            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/19/rogue-agents-and-shadow-ai-why-vcs-are-betting-big-on-ai-security/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">What happens when an AI agent decides the best way to complete a task is to blackmail you?

That’s not a hypothetical. According to Barmak Meftah, a partner at cybersecurity VC firm Ballistic Ventures, it recently happened to an enterprise employee working with an AI agent. The employee tried to suppress what the agent wanted to do, what it was trained to do, and it responded by scanning the user’s inbox, finding some inappropriate emails, and threatening to blackmail the user by forwarding the emails to the board of directors.

“In the agent’s mind, it’s doing the right thing,” Meftah told TechCrunch on last week’s episode of Equity. “It’s trying to protect the end user and the enterprise.”

Meftah’s example is reminiscent of Nick Bostrom’s AI paperclip problem. That thought experiment illustrates the potential existential risk posed by a superintelligent AI that single-mindedly pursues a seemingly innocuous goal – make paperclips – to the exclusion of all human values. In the case of this enterprise AI agent, its lack of context around why the employee was trying to override its goals led it to create a sub-goal that removed the obstacle (via blackmail) so it could meet its primary goal. That combined with the non-deterministic nature of AI agents means “things can go rogue,” per Meftah.

Misaligned agents are just one layer of the AI security challenge that Ballistic’s portfolio company Witness AI is trying to solve. Witness AI says it monitors AI usage across enterprises and can detect when employees use unapproved tools, block attacks, and ensure compliance.

Witness AI this week raised $58 million off the back of over 500% growth in ARR and scaled employee headcount by 5x over the last year as enterprises look to understand shadow AI use and scale AI safely. As part of Witness AI’s fundraise, the company announced new agentic AI security protections.

“People are building these AI agents that take on the authorizations and capabilities of the people that manage them, and you want to make sure that these agents aren’t going rogue, aren’t deleting files, aren’t doing something wrong,” Rick Caccia, co-founder and CEO of Witness AI, told TechCrunch on Equity.

Meftah sees agent usage growing “exponentially” across the enterprise. To complement that rise – and the machine-speed level of AI-powered attacks – analyst Lisa Warren predicts that AI security software will become an $800 billion to $1.2 trillion market by 2031.

“I do think runtime observability and runtime frameworks for safety and risk are going to be absolutely essential,” Meftah said.

As to how such startups plan to compete with big players like AWS, Google, Salesforce and others who have built AI governance tools into their platforms, Meftah said, “AI safety and agentic safety is so huge,” there’s room for many approaches.

Plenty of enterprises “want a standalone platform, end-to-end, to essentially provide that observability and governance around AI and agents,” he said.

Caccia noted that Witness AI lives at the infrastructure layer, monitoring interactions between users and AI models, rather than building safety features into the models themselves. And that was intentional.

“We purposely picked a part of the problem where OpenAI couldn’t easily subsume you,” he said. “So it means we end up competing more with the legacy security companies than the model guys. So the question is, how do you beat them?”

For his part, Caccia doesn’t want Witness AI to be one of the startups to just get acquired. He wants his company to be the one that grows and becomes a leading independent provider.

“CrowdStrike did it in endpoint [protection]. Splunk did it in SIEM. Okta did it in identity,” he said. “Someone comes through and stands next to the big guys…and we built Witness to do that from Day One.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">TechCrunch Disrupt Battlefield 2023 winner, BioticsAI, announced on Monday that it has received FDA clearance for its AI software that helps detect fetal abnormalities in ultrasound images.

The product was envisioned by founder CEO Robhy Bustami, who was raised in a family of obstetricians, including his mother, aunt and uncle. He spent a lot of time in hospitals growing up, often traveling with his mother as she provided maternal care throughout the U.S.

After learning to code and studying computer science at UC Irvine, Bustami teamed up with Salman Khan, Chaskin Saroff, and Dr. Hisham Elgammal in 2021 to launch BioticsAI.

The technology uses computer vision AI “to support fetal ultrasound quality assessment, anatomical completeness, automated reporting, and seamless integration into clinical workflows,” Bustami told TechCrunch.

He hopes his tech will help the U.S. combat the fact that the U.S. has one of the worst prenatal outcomes for mothers among high-income nations. Black women in particular face a very high rate of maternal deaths,

Bustami said that the prenatal ultrasound has become the “cornerstone” of monitoring pregnancies, but its low-quality images can lead to misdiagnosis.

Bustami said the hardest part was not building his AI models, which were trained on a diverse set of hundreds of thousands of ultrasounds, but ensuring the tech performed reliably in the real world, especially on demographics with the highest risk for a tragic outcome.

“In an environment where disparities in healthcare outcomes are well documented, it was critical to demonstrate consistent performance across patient subgroups, not just in idealized cases,” Bustami continued.

The CEO said it took just under three years to go through the FDA process, including testing and validating the product. The experience taught him and his team how critical it is for engineering, product, clinical, and regulatory work to be tightly aligned from the very beginning. “By designing the product, clinical validation, and regulatory pathway together, rather than sequentially, we were able to move quickly,” he said.

Now with FDA clearance, Bustami said the companies’ next focus is scaling across various health systems nationwide. He also has plans to add more features for fetal medicine and reproductive health.

“We’re positioned to scale both distribution and clinical impact while continuing to deepen the power of our technology,” he said.

            <h2>Sequoia to invest in Anthropic, breaking VC taboo on backing rivals: FT</h2>
            <p><strong>TechCrunch | 2026-01-18</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/18/sequoia-to-invest-in-anthropic-breaking-vc-taboo-on-backing-rivals-ft/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Sequoia Capital is reportedly joining a blockbuster funding round for Anthropic, the AI startup behind Claude, according to the Financial Times. It’s a move sure to turn heads in Silicon Valley.

Why? Because venture capital firms have historically avoided backing competing companies in the same sector, preferring to place their bets on a single winner. Yet here’s Sequoia, already invested in both OpenAI and Elon Musk’s xAI, now throwing its weight behind Anthropic, too.

The timing is particularly surprising given what OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said under oath last year. As part of OpenAI’s defense against a high-profile lawsuit by Musk, Altman addressed earlier rumors about restrictions in OpenAI’s 2024 funding round. While he denied that OpenAI investors were broadly prohibited from backing rivals, he did acknowledge that investors with ongoing access to OpenAI’s confidential information were told that access would be terminated “if they made non-passive investments in OpenAI’s competitors.” Altman called this “industry standard” protection (which it is) against misuse of competitively-sensitive information.

According to the FT, Sequoia is joining a funding round led by Singapore’s GIC and U.S. investor Coatue, which are each contributing $1.5 billion. Anthropic is aiming to raise $25 billion or more at a $350 billion valuation — more than double its $170 billion valuation from just four months ago. The WSJ and Bloomberg had earlier reported the round at $10 billion. Microsoft and Nvidia have committed up to $15 billion combined, with VCs and other investors said to be contributing another $10 billion or more.

The Sequoia connection with Altman runs deep. When Altman dropped out of Stanford to start Loopt, Sequoia backed him. He later became a “scout” for Sequoia, introducing the firm to Stripe, which became one of the firm’s most valuable portfolio companies. Sequoia’s new co-leader Alfred Lin and Altman also appear comparatively close. Lin has interviewed Altman numerous times at Sequoia events, and when Altman was briefly ousted from OpenAI in November 2023, Lin publicly said he’d eagerly back Altman’s “next world-changing company.”

While Sequoia’s investment in xAI might seem to have already contradicted the traditional VC approach of picking winners, that bet is widely viewed as less about backing an OpenAI competitor and more about deepening the firm’s extensive ties to Elon Musk. Sequoia invested in X when Musk bought Twitter and rebranded it, is an investor in SpaceX and The Boring Company, and is a major backer of Neuralink, Musk’s brain-computer interface company. Former longtime Sequoia leader Michael Moritz was even an early investor in Musk’s X.com, which became part of PayPal.

Sequoia’s apparent reversal on portfolio conflicts is especially glaring given its historical stance. As we reported in 2020, the firm took the extraordinary step of walking away from its investment in payments company Finix after determining the startup competed with Stripe. Sequoia forfeited its $21 million investment, letting Finix keep the money while giving up its board seat, information rights, and shares, marking the first time in the firm’s history it had severed ties with a newly funded company over a conflict of interest. (Sequoia had led Finix’s $35 million Series B round just months earlier.)

The reported Anthropic investment comes after dramatic leadership changes at Sequoia, where the firm’s global steward, Roelof Botha, was forced aside in a surprise vote this fall just days after sitting down with this editor at TechCrunch Disrupt, with Lin and Pat Grady — who’d led that Finix deal — taking over.

Anthropic is reportedly preparing for an IPO that could come as soon as this year. We’ve reached out to Sequoia Capital for comment.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The United States is a global superpower, and its military trains for war in every domain. During my years as a military educator, I saw American officers wrestle with any number of scenarios designed to challenge their thinking and force them to adapt to surprises. One case we never considered, however, was how to betray and attack our own allies. We did not ask what to do if the president becomes a threatening megalomaniac who tells one of our oldest friends, Norway, that because the Nobel Committee in Oslo refuses to give him a trophy, he no longer feels “an obligation to think purely of Peace” and can instead turn his mind toward planning to wage war against NATO.

As my colleague Anne Applebaum wrote today, Donald Trump’s threatening message to the Norwegian prime minister should, in any responsible democracy, force the rest of the U.S. political system to act to control him. The president is talking about an invasion that would require “citizens of a treaty ally,” as she put it, “to become American against their will,” all because he “now genuinely lives in a different reality.” And yet neither Congress nor the sycophants in the White House seem willing to stop him.

Anne Applebaum: Trump’s letter to Norway should be the last straw

The U.S. military is obligated by law, and by every tradition of American decency, to refuse to follow illegal orders. But what about orders that may not be illegal but are clearly immoral and illogical? The president, for example, can order the Pentagon to plan for an invasion of Greenland; such an order would be little more than a direction to organize one more war game. (The military, as it sometimes does during war games, might not even use real place names, but rather use maps that look a lot like the North Atlantic as it organizes an invasion of “Verdegrun” or something.)

But after years of experience with American military officers, I believe that even these hypothetical instructions will sound utterly perverse to men and women who have served with the Danes and other NATO allies. Denmark not only was our ally during the world wars of the 20th century, but also, as my colleague Isaac Stanley-Becker has written, joined our fight against the Taliban after 9/11 and suffered significant casualties for a small nation. Their soldiers bled and died on the same battlefields as Americans.

American officers know what Trump is planning—the world knows it, because Trump won’t stop saying it—and their minds will rebel at directives to take everything they’ve prepared to do for years and apply it backwards, against the people they have trained to work with and protect. The president, in other words, will be ordering them to do something they have been trained never to do.

America’s armed forces are conditioned to obey the orders of civilian authorities, and rightly so. But these will be orders that force U.S. military minds to step into a horrifying mirror universe where the United States is the aggressor against NATO, a coalition that includes countries that have been our friends for centuries. Should Trump pursue this scheme of conquest, the military’s training will have to be shattered and reassembled into a destructive version of itself, as if doctors were asked to take lifesaving medicines, reconstitute them as poisonous isomers, and then administer them to patients.

I think back to my days as the chairman of the Strategy and Policy Department at the War College, and I can only imagine what would have happened had I convened the faculty and students and said: “It’s time for us to think about how you might plan for an American invasion of a NATO country. Small nations have no claim to sovereignty and cannot defend their borders or possessions; we should create case studies for seizing whatever we want from them.”

The most likely outcome of such a meeting is that I would have been called in to explain myself to my superiors. If I had stayed fixated on such an idea, I might have been relieved of my leadership duties. If I had remained as adamant as Trump has become on the subject, I might have been directed to seek counseling or even undergo a renewed background check. Today, however, this aggressive and immoral stance is the policy of the commander in chief—because when the president speaks, it is policy—and he may well order the military to move it from rhetoric to reality.

Some military officers will shrug at Trump’s ravings and say that orders are orders, and that yesterday’s friends are today’s enemies. Every defense organization has people in it, uniformed and civilian, who are morally hollow and see only figures on a map that must be targeted for elimination. But most Americans, and the members of the military that serves them, are decent people. They know that attacking your friends is evil and mad. I am certain that the men and women of the armed forces will be conflicted and disturbed as they try to turn Trump’s unhinged obsessions into a coherent military plan.

In the end, however, if senior officers—starting with the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the heads of each service—follow Trump down this dark road, the officers and enlisted people below them will likely obey the chain of command. Such an outcome would be a tragedy, and potentially a global catastrophe.

It is not up to the armed forces to put a stop to Trump’s ghastly ideas. Every molecule in the body of almost every uniformed American service member is likely to reject doing something they have spent a lifetime training never to do, but the United States is not run by the military, nor should it be. Americans, and their elected representatives, must take this burden away from the armed forces—now.</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Let me begin by quoting, in full, a letter that the president of the United States of America sent yesterday to the prime minister of Norway, Jonas Gahr Støre. The text was forwarded by the White House National Security Council to ambassadors in Washington, and was clearly intended to be widely shared. Here it is:

Considering your Country decided not to give me the Nobel Peace Prize for having stopped 8 Wars PLUS, I no longer feel an obligation to think purely of Peace, although it will always be predominant, but can now think about what is good and proper for the United States of America. Denmark cannot protect that land from Russia or China, and why do they have a “right of ownership” anyway? There are no written documents, it’s only a boat that landed there hundreds of years ago, but we had boats landing there, also. I have done more for NATO than any person since its founding, and now, NATO should do something for the United States. The World is not secure unless we have Complete and Total Control of Greenland. Thank you! President DJT

One could observe many things about this document. One is the childish grammar, including the strange capitalizations (“Complete and Total Control”). Another is the loose grasp of history. Donald Trump did not end eight wars. Greenland has been Danish territory for centuries. Its residents are Danish citizens who vote in Danish elections. There are many “written documents” establishing Danish sovereignty in Greenland, including some signed by the United States. In his second term, Trump has done nothing for NATO—an organization that the U.S. created and theoretically leads, and that has only ever been used in defense of American interests. If the European members of NATO have begun spending more on their own defense (budgets to which the U.S. never contributed), that’s because of the threat they feel from Russia.

Eliot A. Cohen: How to understand Trump’s obsession with Greenland

Yet what matters isn’t the specific phrases, but the overall message: Donald Trump now genuinely lives in a different reality, one in which neither grammar nor history nor the normal rules of human interaction now affect him. Also, he really is maniacally, unhealthily obsessive about the Nobel Prize. The Norwegian Nobel Committee, not the Norwegian government and certainly not the Danish government, determines the winner of that prize. Yet Trump now not only blames Norway for failing to give it to him, but is using it as a justification for an invasion of Greenland.

Think about where this is leading. One possibility, anticipated this morning by financial markets, is a damaging trade war. Another is an American military occupation of Greenland. Try to imagine it: The U.S. Marines arrive in Nuuk, the island’s capital. Perhaps they kill some Danes; perhaps some American soldiers die too. And then what? If the invaders were Russians, they would arrest all of the politicians, put gangsters in charge, shoot people on the street for speaking Danish, change school curricula, and carry out a fake referendum to rubber-stamp the conquest. Is that the American plan too? If not, then what is it? This would not be the occupation of Iraq, which was difficult enough. U.S. troops would need to force Greenlanders, citizens of a treaty ally, to become American against their will.

For the past year, American allies around the world have tried very hard to find a theory that explains Trump’s behavior. Isolationism, neo-imperialism, and patrimonialism are all words that have been thrown around. But in the end, the president himself defeats all attempts to describe a “Trump doctrine.” He is locked into a world of his own, determined to “win” every encounter, whether in an imaginary competition for the Nobel Peace Prize or a protest from the mother of small children objecting to his masked, armed paramilitary in Minneapolis. These contests matter more to him than any long-term strategy. And of course, the need to appear victorious matters much more than Americans’ prosperity and well-being.

Read: Denmark’s army chief says he’s ready to defend Greenland

The people around Trump could find ways to stop him, as some did in his first term, but they seem too corrupt or too power-hungry to try. That leaves Republicans in Congress as the last barrier. They owe it to the American people, and to the world, to stop Trump from acting out his fantasy in Greenland and doing permanent damage to American interests. He is at risk of alienating friends in not only Europe but also India, whose leader he also snubbed for failing to nominate him for a Nobel Prize, as well as South Korea, Japan, Australia. Years of careful diplomacy, billions of dollars in trade, are now at risk because senators and representatives who know better have refused to use the powers they have to block him. Now is the time.</div>

            <h2>Welfare Fraud Is a Problem—For Democrats</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-01-19</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/2026/01/democrats-welfare-fraud/685661/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The massive scandal around welfare fraud in Minnesota became a big story the same way the character Mike Campbell in The Sun Also Rises describes going bankrupt: “gradually and then suddenly.” Federal prosecutors first filed criminal charges in 2022 against the fraudsters at a Minnesota nonprofit called Feeding Our Future, who stole hundreds of millions of dollars while supposedly serving meals to low-income children and adults. Nearly 80 people have already been convicted or pleaded guilty, and more are expected. But only in recent months has this case—which the lead prosecutor has described as “industrial-scale fraud”—become a national fixation.

President Trump is cannily exploiting this matter to push his anti-immigrant agenda, given that many of the convicted offenders are Somali Americans. Trump has also turned Minnesota’s failure, under Governor Tim Walz, to adequately supervise its social-benefit programs into a broader indictment of financial mismanagement in Democrat-led states. The White House announced earlier this month a plan to freeze billions of dollars in federal social-services funding to five blue states until they delivered reams of data on recipients, providers, and the measures they’re taking to combat fraud—a move that a judge has temporarily blocked. Some Republicans have joined the president in dismissing the entire welfare system as little more than institutionalized theft.

Given the politics involved, it might seem best for Democrats to simply downplay what happened in Minnesota as the product of a few proverbial bad apples. Accusations of welfare fraud have been a staple of right-wing discourse for decades, after all. Ronald Reagan famously rode into office in 1981 with speeches about the wasteful, slothful cunning of a “welfare queen.”

It would be a mistake, though, for Democrats to try to duck and dodge this case. What happened in Minnesota is a disgrace, and one that should prompt reforms to how states handle and monitor social-welfare benefits. The people leading the fight against fraud should not be those who want to dismantle the social safety net but those who want to keep it.

Problems of fraud and abuse are more likely in the United States than in other Western countries because the U.S. has chosen to outsource to private businesses and nonprofits social services such as health care, child care, food banks, and help for the disabled. This move, driven by a faith in the private sector to offer better services at lower costs, isn’t inherently problematic, but it creates incentives for people to game the system. Firms and organizations can juice their federal reimbursements either by falsifying client data to make more people eligible for benefits or by making fraudulent claims about how many clients are being served or what services they are receiving. Feeding Our Future, for example, received hundreds of millions of dollars from the government thanks to fake invoices and meal-count data.

Kevin Carey: Scammers are coming for college students

When Elon Musk’s DOGE sought to crack down on instances of government waste, fraud, and abuse last year, the narrative was that Uncle Sam was ripping off taxpayers, when many cases of fraud actually involve businesses and schemers ripping off the government.

In principle, both parties should be interested in fighting fraud. In practice, Republicans rarely want to spend more money on government programs that they’d prefer to shrink, and Democrats are reluctant to amplify concerns that fraud is a significant problem at all. Some also worry that ham-fisted attempts to counter fraud can end up denying worthy people necessary services. In 2013, Michigan used a fraud-detection algorithm to strip benefits from about 40,000 people, yet more than 90 percent of these recipients were, in fact, eligible.

Other hurdles include the fact that many data-technology systems at government agencies are outdated, unwieldy, and hard to change. Keeping track of every program and provider is also simply hard, considering the plethora of different welfare resources. A subtler challenge is that no one gets credit for spending defensively to keep fraud at bay. Given that the federal government loses between $230 billion and $520 billion annually to fraud, according to federal data, the benefits of prevention are real. But when a budget is in the red, it can be difficult to push for a significant investment to essentially maintain the status quo.

One way to solve this problem would be to let the government deliver services directly. State-run day-care centers and food banks would likely edge out most cases of fraud, as government employees would reap few benefits from saying that they were serving more people than they actually were. Because such sweeping changes are unlikely, it’s essential to invest in what’s called “program integrity”: robust mechanisms that deter fraud by detecting it quickly when it occurs.

This is already happening in some areas. The federal government has robust Medicaid and Medicare fraud divisions, and states annually audit about 50,000 cases of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, otherwise known as food stamps (the results of which suggest that less than 2 percent of recipients are ineligible). But the U.S. has a wide range of social-welfare programs, most of them managed by states, which have proved to be less rigorous in supervising how government funds are spent, or in solving problems when they arise.

In the case of Feeding Our Future, there were many red flags, and they did not go unnoticed by the Minnesota Department of Education, which was responsible for oversight. State officials found that the organization’s internal controls were “seriously deficient.” At one point, Feeding Our Future claimed to be serving an improbable 2.9 million meals and snacks a month to low-income children and adults. Yet the state still sent money the organization’s way, much of which went to commercial and residential real estate, fancy cars, electronics, and jewelry.

Ezekiel J. Emanuel: The great big Medicare rip-off

States can employ plenty of affordable measures to oversee social-service providers, including better data collection and more cameras at food banks and day-care centers. Minnesota recently announced new audits of social-service programs and launched a new fraud-fighting unit. But nothing will prove effective if regulators, state officials, and the courts aren’t willing to act. Minnesota certainly had more than enough evidence to cut off funding to Feeding Our Future before the scandal got out of control.

Democrats need to appreciate that welfare fraudsters aren’t just stealing money—they’re also eroding the case for a strong social safety net. The more invested policy makers are in keeping a healthy welfare state, the more they have at stake in keeping it honest.</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Belzoni, Mississippi, a town of about 2,000 people, is known as the “Catfish Capital of the World”; it is also known as the site of one of the first civil-rights-era lynchings. On May 7, 1955, two members of the local White Citizens’ Council shot into the cab of Reverend George Lee’s car; the bullets ripped off the lower half of his face. Lee had been a co-founder of the town’s NAACP chapter and the first Black person to successfully register to vote in Humphreys County since Reconstruction. He’d also registered about 100 of his fellow Black citizens to vote, a remarkable feat given Belzoni’s size and the ever-present threat of violence against Black people throughout the South who dared to exercise their franchise during the Jim Crow era.

The Mississippi NAACP, led by Medgar Evers, began to investigate the death as a murder. But the county sheriff rejected the idea that there had been any foul play, instead suggesting that Lee had died in a car accident and that the lead bullets detected in his jaw were simply dental fillings. The local prosecutor refused to move forward with the case, and the white men went free.

I learned this story recently, after visiting the National Memorial for Peace and Justice—known to many as the National Lynching Memorial—in Montgomery, Alabama. The memorial consists of more than 800 rectangular steel pillars, each representing a different county in which a lynching took place. One of them is Humphreys, in Mississippi.

From the June 2024 issue: The lynching that sent my family north

It was a cold, rainy day, and my first time seeing the memorial. The space is haunting in its stillness, and overwhelming in its scale. Some of the steel pillars are suspended from above, while others are closer to the ground, forcing you to walk among them, through a steel labyrinth of racial terror.

A man named Lee Perkins was also at the memorial that day, being pushed around in a wheelchair by his son-in-law Chris Brown. Perkins was born in Belzoni in 1937. He was 17 when the lynching took place. As he told me about growing up as a Black child in the Mississippi Delta, he looked up, his eyes tracing the pillars’ long, still bodies. He had a coarse voice with a warm southern drawl. “I never thought I would see something like this,” he said, his neck craning to read the names on each piece of steel. Dusk began to settle around us, and the sky slowly darkened at its edges.

“I pray to God they never get rid of this history,” Brown said. “We as a Black race went through so much, and they’re trying to erase that.”

The lynching memorial has two sister sites in Montgomery—the Legacy Museum, which traces the history of Black oppression in America from slavery to Jim Crow to mass incarceration, and Freedom Monument Sculpture Park, a 17-acre site that uses both contemporary sculptures and original artifacts to illuminate the lives and experiences of enslaved people. All three were created by the Equal Justice Initiative, a nonprofit legal organization founded in 1989 that has expanded into narrative and public-history work over the past decade and a half under the leadership of its founder and executive director, Bryan Stevenson.

Stevenson began his career as a public-interest lawyer, and went on to argue in front of the Supreme Court on five occasions, winning favorable judgments in all but one. He successfully argued, for example, against mandatory life sentences without parole for children, and for incarcerated people with dementia to be protected, in some cases, from execution. But he has said that as time passed, he came to understand that his legal work would not be enough on its own to effect meaningful criminal-justice reform. The American public, he felt, needed a deeper understanding of how the realities of the country’s history shaped the present-day system.

The Legacy Museum, which opened almost eight years ago, is perhaps the closest thing America has to a national slavery museum. Crucially, however, it is completely privately funded, receiving no state or federal financial support. As such, Stevenson and his colleagues are unburdened by executive orders; they need not bow to pressure to alter an exhibit after a presidential Truth Social post. I wanted to get a sense of how visitors were experiencing the museum and memorials now, when so much of what they depict represents the very history that the Trump administration aims to de-emphasize—if not outright erase—at schools, historic sites, and museums across the country. I also wondered how Stevenson thought about the role these spaces play today, compared with when they first opened, and what kinds of knowledge he hoped they might be able to provide to the visiting public as the country and its politics change around them.

Erasure was a recurring theme among the people I spoke with in Montgomery. On the opposite side of the memorial, I met two Black women, Jackie Brown and Annette Pinckney, who were also visiting for the first time. “We’re from Florida, where you have Governor Ron DeSantis, who is trying to erase our history,” Pinckney said.

Pinckney is an assistant principal at a high school in South Florida, and she has seen firsthand the impact of the state’s recent laws—such as the Stop WOKE Act—that regulate how schools and businesses deal with issues of race and gender. The Florida Department of Education has also banned AP African American Studies from being offered in Florida high schools, claiming that the curriculum lacks “educational value and historical accuracy.”

Earlier in their visit, Pinckney and Brown had stood inside a real former slave cabin located along the Alabama River, on which thousands of enslaved people had once been trafficked. They described feeling the biting wind whistle into the cabin through holes in the wood-panel walls, and thinking about how susceptible to the elements the family staying inside would have been. Pinckney wrapped her arms tight around her chest. “That right there was just gut-wrenching,” she said. “It makes it more real.”

The visceral experience they had is precisely the point, Stevenson told me. When we met that evening at the EJI office, Stevenson said that the goal of the sites is to force visitors to confront the violence of the past without the counterweight of a more uplifting narrative to assuage their distress. The sites were built with the aim of not repeating the triumphant progress narrative found in some other civil-rights museums, which, as he put it, “would rather tell a story of achievement than a story of continuing struggle.”

“I love those museums,” Stevenson said. “But if people are allowed to walk out thinking, Oh, isn’t that great that we had that civil-rights movement, and that took care of racism in America, that ended the struggle over voting rights, that ended the struggle over integration and access—if we do that, then we’re undermining the effort to achieve racial justice.” Many civil-rights museums rely on resources from state and federal governments, and Stevenson wonders if some of them feel pressure to tell a story that will satisfy those funders.

For many visitors, the EJI museums have become a site of pilgrimage, which has made them a major driver of tourism to Alabama. The museums are consistently one of the two most-popular paid attractions in the state (the other is the U.S. Space and Rocket Center in Huntsville), and they receive about 500,000 visitors each year. “Eight hotels have been built in this city since we’ve opened, and airports have record levels,” Stevenson told me.

Another Black-history museum that serves as a site of pilgrimage is the Smithsonian’s National Museum of African American History and Culture, in Washington, D.C., which opened two years prior to the Legacy Museum. Stevenson said that the Smithsonian museum is an essential presence on the National Mall, and that it is more comprehensive than any other museum on Black life in the country. He worries, however, that it, too, can allow some visitors to leave with an incorrect impression of unalloyed triumph. This is in part, he believes, the result of how the museum was designed. Because its primary sections on the oppression and violence that Black people were subjected to during the Middle Passage, slavery, and Jim Crow are below the museum’s street-level entrance—while the culture exhibits are upstairs—the history exhibitions are effectively optional for visitors.

According to museum employees Stevenson has spoken with, this design choice poses an educational challenge. “They have a lot of school kids and a lot of groups that come in, and they get in the elevator and they go straight to the upper floors. They want to see Michael Jackson’s coat, and Michael Jordan’s shoe, and B. B. King’s guitar, and then they want to see the stuff on Obama, and then they want to go have a meal,” Stevenson said. In Montgomery, he explained, “it was important to create a narrative journey where you don’t have the option to avoid the hard stuff.”

Still, the hard stuff is a big enough part of the Smithsonian’s offering to visitors that in August, the Trump administration announced it would be undertaking a review of the institution and demanded that the Smithsonian turn over troves of documents including an inventory of all permanent holdings, all internal communications relevant to the approval of exhibitions and artwork, and information regarding 250th-anniversary programming. A week later, on social media, the president castigated the Smithsonian museums for supposedly having an undue focus on “how horrible our Country is, how bad Slavery was, and how unaccomplished the downtrodden have been.”

Stevenson insists that the goal of the Legacy Museum is not to present Alabama as irredeemably racist or forever entrapped by its past. Alabama is a state that he loves. It is his home. He believes it can be different in the future, but not if people turn away from the past. “I don’t think slavery should define Alabama,” he said. “And if we have the courage to talk about it honestly, it won’t. But we can’t not talk about it and have a proper understanding of who we are.”

At the Legacy Museum, which is built on the site of a cotton warehouse where enslaved people were once forced to work, some of the first items you encounter are clay sculptures depicting the heads of captured Africans rising from the earth, many with chains around their necks, as digital ocean waves crash on screens behind them.

Through detailed explanations of the role that slavery played in every region of early America, you learn that Delaware passed a law prohibiting free Black people from moving to the state. You learn that in 1730, almost half of all white residents of New York personally owned an enslaved person. You learn that by the mid-18th century, enslaved people made up 70 percent of Charleston’s population.

In the next room, ghostlike figures projected onto the walls sing in re-created slave pens. I stood next to a man and his young daughter in the long hall lined with cages as we watched a phantom woman sing the chorus of a haunting Negro spiritual. The girl leaned into her father’s side and wrapped her arms around his waist as he held one hand on her shoulder.

After the Legacy Museum’s series of exhibits on slavery, visitors encounter a section that focuses on how the decades following emancipation were less a period of unfettered upward mobility for Black Americans than one of widespread, sustained racial terror—which often came in the form of lynchings. One of the most affecting displays is a wall lined with hundreds of jars of soil excavated from sites of lynchings across the country. As I walked by the jars, I was struck by how the color and texture of the soil in each one was different.

The soil from the site of Will Archer’s lynching in Carrollton, Alabama, on September 14, 1893, was cinnamon-red and gravelly.

The soil from the site of Marshall Boston’s lynching in Frankfort, Kentucky, on August 15, 1894, was light brown and rocky.

The soil from the site of Odis Price’s lynching in Perry, Florida, on August 9, 1938, was black and fine as sand.

One of the Legacy Museum’s walls shows a floor-to-ceiling image of the infamous “Scourged Back” photograph, which depicts the horrifyingly scarred back of a formerly enslaved man named Peter who had received violent beatings. It was taken and published in the spring of 1863, in the midst of the Civil War and not long after the Emancipation Proclamation. The photo first circulated in northern cities in the form of small prints known as cartes de visite. When Harper’s Magazine published it in its July 4 issue, many Americans saw, for the first time, the physical violence wrought by slavery. The photograph boosted the abolitionist cause and challenged the widespread notion that slavery had been a benevolent and gentle institution. Since then, it has become one of the defining images of the brutality of enslavement, and has appeared in countless textbooks, museums, and magazines.

The photo’s presence in the Legacy Museum was particularly conspicuous at this moment. In September, The Washington Post reported that the same photograph had been removed from a national park in accordance with a Trump-issued executive order.

Less than a mile away from the Legacy Museum is the First White House of the Confederacy, where Jefferson Davis and his family lived in the breakaway nation’s earliest days. This White House receives substantial funding from the state of Alabama, and its mission is codified in Alabama state law: “the preservation of Confederate relics and as a reminder for all time of how pure and great were southern statesmen and southern valor.” In 2023, the Associated Press reported that people who visited the museum, including thousands of Alabama schoolchildren, were taught that President Davis had led a “heroic resistance” in the “war for southern independence” and was “held by his Negroes in genuine affection as well as highest esteem.”

Clint Smith: Actually, slavery was very bad

“When I moved to Montgomery in the ’80s, there were 59 markers and monuments to the Confederacy in the city,” Stevenson told me. And despite Montgomery being among the most prominent slave-trading cities in America leading up to the Civil War, “you could not find the word slave, slavery, or enslavement anywhere in the city landscape.”

I asked Stevenson if he thought the United States should have a public, national museum, in addition to the Smithsonian’s NMAAHC, dedicated specifically to slavery, or if it was better to have privately funded institutions like the Legacy Museum focus on that history. He paused and considered the question.

“I’m not sure we’re ready for a state-sanctioned truth telling about the history of slavery,” he said. “We can have a state-sanctioned space, but I don’t know why we would expect it to be a truth-telling space.” He pointed his finger down on the table. “Because the reality is we’re not yet at the point where, some would say, it’s in the state’s interest to be truthful about this history, so it would take a lot to get that truth to come through.”

Touring the Legacy Museum that afternoon, I’d seen a Black family with three children standing in a long hallway that outlined the chronology of Black life in America. The two older siblings ambled from one photo and caption to the next, while the youngest, a boy of about 7 years old, stood with his parents and read the captions out loud as his mother helped him through the words he couldn’t pronounce. They came to an image of a young white boy, about the same age as the Black boy, standing beneath the dangling feet of a Black man who had been lynched from a tree. The man’s face was cropped out of the photograph. The boy in the museum locked eyes with the boy in the image. I heard his parents tell him that sometimes children attended lynchings as well. The father stroked the top of his son’s head, and they walked on.</div>

            <h2>‘Looksmaxxing’ Reveals the Depth of the Crisis Facing Young Men</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-01-19</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/2026/01/looksmaxxing-clavicular-vanity-trump/685636/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The so-called looksmaxxing movement is narcissistic, cruel, racist, shot through with social Darwinism, and proudly anti-compassion. As the name suggests, looksmaxxers share a monomaniacal commitment to improving their physical appearance. They trade stories of breaking their legs in order to gain extra inches, “bonesmashing” their faces with hammers to heighten their cheekbones, injecting steroids and testosterone to inflate their muscles, and even smoking crystal meth to suppress their appetite. If you had to pick a single corner of the internet that best captures the vices of the Trump era, you couldn’t beat the looksmaxxers. Perhaps more than any other group, they reveal the depth of the moral crisis that confronts young men today.

Although many looksmaxxers support Donald Trump, they defy neat political classification. The community is simply too nihilistic. Its newest star, Braden Peters, made this clear during a recent podcast interview with the conservative commentator Michael Knowles, in which the two discussed a potential 2028 presidential contest between California Governor Gavin Newsom and Vice President J. D. Vance. Peters said he disagrees with Newsom’s politics but would vote for the governor anyway because he’s more handsome—or, in the group’s parlance, he “mogs” Vance. The governor is a “Chad” and the vice president is “subhuman,” Peters explained to Knowles, who was gobsmacked.

On social media, Peters goes by the moniker “Clavicular,” a reference to the unusual importance that looksmaxxers place on the width of their clavicles. The white 20-year-old, who was expelled from college, has quickly become the most recognizable member of the movement thanks in part to his constant presence online. Perhaps his most viral moment came on Christmas Eve. While livestreaming from Miami, Peters appears to run over an alleged stalker with his Cybertruck. “Is he dead?” he asks the girl riding in the car with him. “Hopefully,” he adds.

George Packer: The depth of MAGA’s moral collapse

Few details have been reliably reported. Some viewers suspected that the incident had been staged. Others claimed to have identified the supposed stalker and said he survived. Whether it was real or faked, the video reveals the breathtaking callousness of Peters and the many fans who rushed to his defense. Indeed, the incident seems only to have grown Peters’s following. James Fishback, a far-right candidate for governor of Florida, posted on X that Peters “did nothing wrong.” (Peters did not respond to a request for an interview.)

My introduction to Peters came late last year, when Instagram’s algorithm served me a video of him wearing a baseball cap, primping and pouting for the camera. He remains silent, letting the large word on his hat do the talking: NIGGA. The post earned him tens of thousands of likes along with the admiration of white nationalists such as Nick Fuentes, who declared to his online following of so-called Groypers that Peters is the modern-day Nietzschean “overman” he had hoped for. “Sculptor and clay!” rhapsodized Fuentes, referring to himself and Peters. “I prefigured the white-ass nigga!”

The looksmaxxing movement—ideologically incoherent but rife with juvenile racism—echoes the ongoing Groyperization of the American right. This is particularly evident in the growing antagonism that certain factions express toward Vance. Fuentes, for example, sounded like a looksmaxxer himself when he criticized the vice president last year. “He’s visibly obese and very ugly. He’s got a fat face, no jawline, no chin,” Fuentes said, before shifting to a more familiar topic for him: “His wife and kids are not white!”

Looksmaxxing grew out of the online culture of “incels,” or involuntary celibates, a term that emerged in the 2010s. United by their resentment of women, incels tend to see attractiveness as a straightforward function of genetics—millimeters, symmetry, skin color—and therefore out of their control. Looksmaxxers hold a similarly superficial view of beauty as a kind of rigid mathematics with a single, knowable solution. But they believe that this makes it malleable: One can “ascend” to a higher plane of attractiveness with enough money, effort, and perhaps the willingness to dabble with crystal meth.

For many members of the group, though, looking good is not a path to social or romantic goals; it is an end in its own right, a kind of self-glorification. Rather than a womanizing Don Juan, their ideal is someone closer to Achilles, the Homeric war hero whose excellence is determined by his success over other men. The primary goal of the looksmaxxer is not sexual pleasure or mating prowess—Peters speaks freely about his infertility, supposedly caused by excessive testosterone supplements—but to mog and achieve status within the pecking order of their same-sex digital community.

This kind of thinking has spread among young men on the right at the same time that many of them are adopting polar-opposite beliefs. Another part of the cohort is embracing Christianity, whose pro-social commitments—monogamy, marriage, childbearing—flatly contradict the looksmaxxing ethos.

Timothy Keller: American Christianity is due for a revival

But the rise of looksmaxxing and the return to social conservatism are both reactions to the same set of conditions. Today’s young men came of age on the social internet, during the upheavals of COVID-19, and under the political dominance of the most narcissistic and superficial president in American history. And their generation has experienced so many of the worst effects of decades of social fragmentation, economic anxiety, and zero-sum competition for what can feel like ever more limited opportunities for meaning, fulfillment, and recognition. Amid this tumult, the fact that Clavicular and his ilk have managed to intrigue so many young men with their brand of nihilism shouldn’t be a surprise. That so many others have sought refuge in traditional sources of order and structure shouldn’t be one either. Instability breeds divergence.

For many of the men who reject conventional norms, appearance has become the stablecoin of the realm. And of course this is true for many women too. Some estimates suggest that more than 3 million women have opened creator accounts on the amateur-pornography website OnlyFans. Many of them are hoping to be the next Sophie Rain, a 23-year-old former waitress from Florida who has already made $82 million on the platform. For younger generations lacking purpose or faith in the future, nothing remains to them but their own bodies, to paraphrase the Hungarian critic László Földényi.

The paradox is that they would manipulate and exploit themselves even as they live in a time of relative peace and plenty. But physical security can coincide with existential precarity. In discussions about looksmaxxing on social media, some critics have highlighted that irony by citing an experiment by the ethologist John B. Calhoun. In 1968, Calhoun built large, enclosed mouse colonies with abundant food and water, no predators, and lots of space for nesting. At first, the population flourished. Later in the experiment, a group of male mice emerged that Calhoun dubbed “the beautiful ones.” These mice spent most of their time grooming, sleeping, and eating—maintaining clean, unscarred bodies and showing no signs of stress. Concerned only with themselves, they disengaged from the other mice and stopped reproducing. Eventually the entire population collapsed.

Oscar Wilde made the strongest case that worshipping beauty for its own sake can end only in death and destruction. Dorian Gray, the Victorian era’s proto-Clavicular, literally exchanges his soul for eternal youth and beauty—a move that the looksmaxxing community would seem to endorse wholeheartedly. The bargain makes him a monster, but Gray’s downfall is not the result of mere egoism. It comes from something even more dangerous: the belief that beauty exempts you from responsibility.</div>

Apollo was trying to meet Kennedy&#39;s deadline and thus took on more risk than perhaps necessary. It seems to me there should be 2 or 3 unmanned moon-loop missions to iron out nearly all known glitches. And perhaps do some stress-testing while at it: test the margins. If something is rated for 90 psi, test it at 89.9 while in space.

Something rated for 90 psi is always tested well above 90 psi. An elevator rated for 4500 pounds is tested with something like 6000 pounds or even more etc. etc.

Can someone convert these units to ones that the aerospace industry actually uses?Yes: 90 psi is about a gazillion pascals.

            <div id="article-text">It&#39;s kinda fun. There are events that run when they expect another drop to fall.

But what exactly are we learning from it?

Sometimes, experiments are worth doing not because we don&#39;t know what the results of the experiment will be, but because young future scientists are constantly being born, and will learn from witnessing the experiment. For some, the fanfare around the latest drip will be the spark that lights a lifelong desire to pursue science. That alone makes it worthwhile.

Mostly it&#39;s a teaching tool/exhibit these days.

This is the experiment that was actually used to determine the relative viscosity of pitch, and there are some other actual materials science findings that were produced from it... admittedly quite some time ago.

I actually do think it is an interesting question - you need continuity of several things (broader social stability, specific organizational stability, a community of people interested enough to bother keeping it going) without any of the usual things that keep something going (profit motive, government edict, etc.)

But I like proof-by-doing sorts of things in general.

There are some experiments that are not possible to complete within a scientist&#39;s lifetime. All of the data-gathering over decades or even centuries is a gift to future generations. Many observations over a very long time-frame in astronomy, weather, solar activity, etc., have led to new understandings and theories.

I&#39;m reminded of a musical analog to this story: ASLSP  [wikipedia.org] by John Cage. The name is roughly a mnemonic for As Slow As Possible. Although it was originally a piano piece intended for concert or recita

We&#39;re leaning how slowly something can drip. It&#39;s just like when you ask someone &quot;how small can you jump?&quot; or &quot;how quietly can you clap?&quot;

I once read that it had to be covered with a glass bell because it was so distracting to those around it. We need to figure out what the heck was put into that pile.

Here&#39;s another long-running experiment [nih.gov] to test how long seeds can be stored.

Pitch pans have been used since the nineteen-hundreds in construction to weatherproof roof penetrations. You need some electrical conduit or some such on the roof, esp. a flat commercial roof, you&#39;d build a sheetmetal enclosure and fill it with pitch after extending the conduit through the roof plate.

Some of the pitch always drips through the roof eventually, sticking to everything in sight, but never quite as well as to human clothing and skin. One contractor I knew would&#39;nt  allow it on his job sites, referring to it as the black death.

Will a pitch droplet refuse to detach while being observed? Just how long can it be held suspended due to observation? Are quantum effects involved? :-P

            <div id="article-text">No more subsidies for any EV automaker. It&#39;s past time they figured out how to do it without taxpayer handouts

Why? The oil industry has been subsidized for decades. Why are EV cars suddenly non-deserving of subsidies when their competitor has indirectly been subsidized all this time AND their competitor is causing very real short and long term environmental and social problems?

well, you see ...ehh ...hmmm ...the reason is ...if we allow ...but ...when you look at ...thing is...

Incorrect. The subsidies are to get people to pick EV&#39;s over fossil fuel cars. The EV industry doesn&#39;t need the subsidy, the customer does.

Once you cross a specific threshold, then you start dialing back the subsidy so certain companies (eg Tesla) are unable to dump unsold product, and companies like Chinese and Korean EV manufacturers are unable to put their garbage products next to better products and demand the same price. Before people forget, the reason for the long decline of American brands worldwide

companies like Chinese and Korean EV manufacturers are unable to put their garbage products next to better products and demand the same price Kia EV3 was crowned World Car of the Year, beating out the BMW X3 and Hyundai Inster. This marks Kia’s second consecutive victory following the EV9’s win in 2024. [drivencarguide.co.nz] LOL

Germany better put some extra money aside to beef up their fire brigades if they let Chinesium into the mix.

&quot;I cannot see any evidence of this postulated major influx of Chinese car manufacturers in Germany, either in the figures or on the roads&quot; German Environment Minister Carsten Schneider said at a Monday press conference.

Germany and France did not rebuild itself after WW2 the Marshal plan did that twice over.

I am willing to bet quite a lot of money that, for all your fierce opposition to China and concerns about kill switches, you typed all that on a device containing Chinese parts that could equally well have a kill switch in it that you would be completely unable to detect.

Every EV is less oil to import.Germany is fast progressing on its energy self sufficienc thx to Putin.

Germany EV sales:2023: 524k2024: 381k -- this was when the sales drop happened2025: 545k -- recovery already happened

2026 can be expected to be substantially stronger, given better vehicles and pricing even before the availability of these new subsidies

The Las Vegas sphere has been losing tens of millions of dollars every quarter. With this new sphere, maybe they can make up for some of those losses in volume!

What is the terminal velocity of a falling apple?

Please don&#39;t let John Waters anywhere near this...

The las vegas sphere was such an absolute boondoggle and continues to lose money it&#39;s suprising there&#39;s any management left to throw out new, worse ideas.

As a Canadian, I don&#39;t know how many of the patrons of these facilities would - in saner times - come from other countries. But if tourist traffic is expected to be a significant source of revenue, they&#39;d best put these plans on hold.

I know that various media outlets, chambers of commerce, and other not-impartial pundits are downplaying the huge drop-off in foreign tourists. These &quot;news&quot; sources ignore or outright deny the impact on tourism of the ICE gestapo, the additional friction and outright risk of cr

Yep.  If the US continues on its current trajectory, it would not surprise me if most/all European countries boycotted the FIFA World Cup.

Arithmetically kinda sorta true, a 6 to 1 ratio, but economically misleading. Most obviously, international tourists bring new money to the US, it&#39;s an export business. Domestic tourism is reallocation of spending that would have largely happened anyway.  Domestic tourism is also a stable business and slow-growing, whereas international is much more flighty and prone to disruption. On the margin, it drives more growth or loss in employment and other economic impacts than domestic demand. Put these together

Everyone that goes to it loves it.  It is supposed to be an incredible experience.  The problem is it was way too costly to build and they can&#39;t charge enough to make it profitable.

But it attracts a lot of people.  Some may consider it a loss leader: something to bring people to your business where you lose money on it, but make money on the other purchases customers make.

We basically have two choices here. We either back the copyright folks and punish AI for theft. If we do this, we hand China the AI race because China will ignore copyright laws and whatcha gonna do about it? Right, nothing.

The other choice is we rule that AI &quot;consuming&quot; any content is perfectly acceptable and we position ourselves for the best chance to win the AI race.

Honestly, either way works for me. Copyright has been extended repeatedly over the years to an absurd length. I&#39;d love to see that change.

Gabfest Reads is a monthly series from the hosts of Slate’s Political Gabfest podcast. Recently, Emily Bazelon spoke with Curtis Sittenfeld about her short story collection, “Show Don’t Tell.” During their discussion, they explored recurring themes of the stories—from troubled marriages and middle age, to the passage of time and how our perception of people and events changes over the years.This partial transcript has been edited and condensed for clarity.

Emily Bazelon: A theme in this book that’s very present is marriage. And actually most of the marriages seemed bad to me as I was reading through this. I was feeling kind of sorry for a lot of people in their partnerships. And there actually is a story called “The Marriage Clock” in which you present explicit advice about how to improve your marriage. And the kind of joke of the story is that the advice comes from a kind of Christian influencer who wrote a really—an accidental—huge bestseller based on this idea of a marriage clock and these various tenets of a good marriage. So how did you come up with this list and what do you actually stand by on this list?

Curtis Sittenfeld: Oh, that’s a good question. Well, let’s see. I’m trying to think how to answer this. I mean, I can’t remember now, it’s like 10 or 12 recommendations and I think they’re a little bit sexist and heteronormative in some cases, but I think probably most of them are good ideas. It’s like, don’t call each other mommy and daddy or like don’t let your children sleep … I mean, I think there are probably good recommendations for the health of a marriage that for many people are probably may be too challenging to adhere to. Or like, I think there can be this tension where what’s good for the family is not good for the marriage. But I mean, I certainly have read marriage self-help books … I think that the two most prominent things that it seems like have permeated the culture are the love languages book and then sort of … I have not actually read the book on attachment theory, but I’m very conversant in attachment theory.

Curtis Sittenfeld: I know— like many people in 2026.

Emily Bazelon: My favorite item on this list, “do not engage in any form of self-grooming in front of your spouse that you wouldn’t perform in the boarding gate area of an airport.”

Curtis Sittenfeld: I’m very interested in the discrepancy between who we aspire to be and who we are on a daily basis. And like so many of us know what we should do to have strong relationships or to have good physical health, but it’s so hard. It’s just so hard. Knowing what the right choices are is different from feeling equipped to make them. And even the person you are at like 3:00 PM or 8:00 PM is maybe less equipped to make good choices than the person you were at like 8:15 AM.

            <div id="article-text">Sign up for the Surge, the newsletter that covers most important political nonsense of the week, delivered to your inbox every Saturday.

Welcome to this week’s edition of the Surge, which is so grateful to have you as adoring readers but will sue you in North Carolina if you alienate your affection for us.

We’ve got a lot of foreign policy this week, a telltale sign that the foreign policy ain’t going great. Domestically, control of the Senate could come down to Alaska, or at least that’s what reporters are telling their editors as they try to secure summer trips. And a Ford factory worker became the new face of the resistance.

First, we begin with the slew of scandals and drama at the Justice Department this week and attempt to discern the root of it all.

Even by the Trump Justice Department’s standards over the last year, this was an eyebrow-raising week. We learned Sunday night, from the dawg Jay Powell himself, that the Federal Reserve chair was under DOJ investigation, ostensibly for his testimony related to Fed renovation costs, but really because he wasn’t lowering interest rates fast enough for Trump. The White House has tried to distance itself from the investigation—to portray it as D.C.’s U.S. attorney Jeanine Pirro freelancing—but Trump has been pressuring Powell for a long, long time. We also learned this week that federal prosecutors are investigating five additional Democratic lawmakers who posted a video last year urging troops to ignore illegal orders. (The Pentagon has been harassing another Democrat, Sen. Mark Kelly, for months.) Trump had called their video “seditious.” Meanwhile, a wave of DOJ prosecutors resigned under pressure to investigate not the ICE killing of Renee Good in Minneapolis, but Good’s widow instead.

Amid the backdrop of a lousier-than-usual week at the DOJ, the most revealing story of the week may have been one in the Wall Street Journal about Trump’s increasing frustration with Attorney General Pam Bondi. “The criticisms,” the Journal wrote, “appear to be part of an intense campaign by Trump to pressure the Justice Department to more aggressively pursue his priorities”—specifically, pursuing his enemies. Consider, too, a separate Journal story about a White House photo op with U.S. attorneys last week during which Trump berated them for being “weak” and complained that they weren’t “moving fast enough to prosecute his favored targets.” Trump has a poor history with attorneys general who, at one point or another, can’t find within the law the answers to his questions. So long as Bondi wants to keep her job, there are many more bad weeks ahead.

The retiring North Carolina Republican senator deserves credit this week for offering meaningful pushback to the administration’s threats against Powell. Shortly after Powell’s SOS message went up Sunday night, Tillis announced that he would oppose any of the president’s Fed nominees until the Powell matter was resolved. Given Tillis’ seat on the Banking Committee, that pledge would prevent any Fed nominee—including Powell’s upcoming replacement as chair—from getting voted out of committee. The pushback from Tillis, and a fair number of other Republican senators, was enough to calm markets and put the White House on its back foot.

Tillis, liberated from electoral concerns, has been speaking up against the administration’s errors more openly in the last couple of weeks. We could leave it at that. But the Surge’s bylaws are clear that no nit be left unpicked, and so we have to quibble with his framing. Tillis’ argument is that the administration is making some dumb decisions because Trump is receiving bad advice. Whichever adviser pursued the “vindictive prosecution” against Powell, he said, needs to “grow up and give the president better advice.” And in terms of seizing Greenland, he said separately that he blamed “whoever told the president that this was a viable path. It doesn’t make sense.” We understand that calling the principal himself an idiot wouldn’t be the most effective means of dissuading him from destructive ideas. But it is the principal, not the advisers, who are the problem. Trump wants to annex Greenland because it looks big on a map, and so the advisers are competing with each other to achieve that for him. He insists the Fed lower interest rates faster, so there’s a Cabinet-wide contest to do what it takes. The bad ideas are coming from the man himself, and he won’t take no for an answer.

The president reiterated on Wednesday that the United States “needs” Greenland, and that anything less than Greenland being “in the hands of the UNITED STATES” is “unacceptable.” And on Friday, while a bipartisan congressional delegation visited Copenhagen to reassure Danish leaders that Congress stood in the way of Trump’s Greenland plans (sure you are, guys), Trump was threatening tariffs against countries if they “don’t go along with Greenland.” You can actually hear his dopamine rush when he says this.

On that note, let’s look at a couple of consequences of Trump’s yearlong effort to antagonize the United States’ closest friends and allies in the free world. In a sentence we never quite thought we’d have to write, numerous European Union countries are deploying troops and military personnel to Greenland in a show of support to Denmark against American aggression towards its allies. Repeat: Europe is sending troops to Greenland while America threatens to seize it. And on Friday during a visit to Beijing, Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney agreed to slash its 100 percent tariff on Chinese electric cars in exchange for China importing more Canadian agricultural products, and said China had become a more “predictable” trading partner than the U.S. Can the Supreme Court go ahead and release that opinion nuking Trump’s tariffs powers soon, please?

The major recruitment news of the week was that former Democratic Alaska Rep. Mary Peltola launched a bid for Senate against incumbent Republican Dan Sullivan. Peltola, who’s reusing the “Fish, family, and freedom” slogan that carried her to House victory in 2022 before a narrow reelection loss in 2024, gives Democrats a fighting chance in a red state where Peltola has won statewide, given that there’s only one congressional district in Alaska, in very recent memory.

Her recruitment is also a critical piece of a much larger puzzle: Giving Democrats a chance—we’re saying there’s a chance!—to pick up the net four seats they would need to retake control of the Senate in the midterms. If Democrats can retain all of the seats they control (including tough races in Michigan and Georgia), the path to Senate control runs through winning the open seat in North Carolina, finally replacing Susan Collins in Maine, hoping ex-Sen. Sherrod Brown can oust Sen. John Husted in Ohio, and then Peltola in Alaska. This is the way, and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer gave 18 billion interviews this week describing it as such. It’s important to observe that each step along this path is quite difficult, and completing it would require a midterm wave in Democrats’ favor. Stranger things have happened.

Even a handful of days ago, a U.S. intervention against the Iranian regime, as the country was swarmed with protests that were being brutally put down, seemed like it was imminent. Military options had been prepared and presented for the president; U.S. personnel were being advised to leave the U.S. military base in Qatar. By Wednesday night, though, Trump said that “we’ve been told that the killing in Iran is stopping—it’s stopped—it’s stopping. And there’s no plan for executions, or an execution.” Iran had signaled as much on Thursday. What Iran has or has not stopped, we don’t know. But this came as the administration received advice from allies in the region—including Saudi Arabia and Israel—not to intervene, arguing that the protests weren’t strong enough to topple the regime and U.S. intervention would cause regional chaos.

Now, Trump could very well surprise-bomb Iran overnight if someone cracks a little too much fresh-ground pepper on his steak. But with the apparent deescalation, the Surge wants to send its thoughts and prayers to South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham. As we wrote last week, he was riding high on the Venezuela intervention and hoped that Trump might fulfill Graham’s top bucket-list item—regime change in Iran—next. Graham was all over TV and social media this week egging on his audience of one. He described Trump as “Reagan Plus” and openly urged him to kill Ayatollah Khamenei. He met with the Shah of Iran’s son, who’s eager to take control of the country. When Trump’s tone shift came later in the week, Graham scrambled to deny that Trump had swung against action or that the protests had ebbed in Iran, and said that he no longer wanted to be allies with allies that told Trump not to get involved. It’s always hard for Graham when a country goes un-bombed, and this is the big one. Let’s give him a little space.

Last week in the Senate, five Republicans joined all Democrats to advance a war powers resolution barring the president from using military force in Venezuela without congressional sign-off. Despite his administration’s firm promise that they have no additional military plans in Venezuela, Trump was furious, saying those five Republicans “should never be elected to office again.” Republican leaders and administration officials set off a fierce pressure campaign to kill the resolution.

The pressure campaign was successful. On Wednesday, Senate Republicans killed the resolution with another procedural vote, having convinced two of the five Republicans—Sens. Josh Hawley and Todd Young—to back off. What were their excuses? Both said that they received a variety of “assurances” from the administration that there were no troops in Venezuela at the moment, and that if the administration does want to send troops in the future, it will totally ask Congress first. Now, the Surge doesn’t think it would be that much effort to encode those promises into law, to be extra careful. You just go to the Senate floor, stick your thumb up, and you’ve voted for it. But what do we know?

Trump’s team organized a nice little afternoon for him on Tuesday: a visit to Michigan to visit Ford’s F-150 factory, where the big trucks get made. Neat! As he was walking through the plant with Ford’s CEO, a 40-year-old line worker later identifying himself as TJ Sabula shouted “Pedophile protector!” at Trump. The president pointed back at him, said “Fuck you,” and then gave him the middle finger. Sabula was suspended.

Sabula, in an interview with the Washington Post, said that he had “no regrets whatsoever” about what he did. “I don’t feel as though fate looks upon you often, and when it does, you better be ready to seize the opportunity,” he said. “And today I think I did that.” While Sabula is concerned about losing his job—and maybe should be a little worried about, like, ICE showing up to his door, pretending that he tried to run over the president with one of the trucks he was assembling—his act of heckling is being well remunerated. A couple of GoFundMe pages in his name have raised over $800,000.

President Trump REALLY wants to invoke the Insurrection Act. He’s fallen hard for this 200-year-old law that would allow him to deploy active duty military to enforce civilian law on American streets. On this week’s Amicus podcast, co-host Mark Joseph Stern is joined by Professor Steve Vladeck, a nationally recognized expert on the Supreme Court, federal courts, national security law, and military justice. They discuss what’s been stopping Trump from invoking the act so far, why he has no legal authority to do so right now, and what happens if he does it anyway.

Next, Mark talks to Julia Gegenheimer, former special litigation counsel in the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division’s Criminal Section, and now a special litigation counsel at Georgetown Law’s Institute for Constitutional Advocacy and Protection. Julia and Mark discuss the remaining paths to justice after the killing of Renee Good and examine what happens when the DOJ abandons its duty to seek accountability and vindicate civil rights.

            <h2>UK gambling regulator accuses Meta of lying about its struggle to spot illegal ads</h2>
            <p><strong>The Register | 2026-01-20</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2026/01/20/uk_gambling_comission_criticizes_meta/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The head of the UK’s Gambling Commission has accused social media giant Meta of lying about its ability to proactively detect operators of illegal casinos advertising on its services.

Speaking at gaming conference ICE 2026 in Barcelona yesterday, the commission’s executive director Tim Miller discussed the regulator’s attempts to understand illegal gambling, which is of interest as his agency’s purpose is to oversee licensed gambling and reduce any harms it causes.

That job is made harder if illegal gambling operations offer an alternative. Miller therefore called for licensed operators to ensure “clear blue water” between their services and others.

He said the waters are instead muddy, because regulators around the world “are increasingly identifying suppliers, affiliates, advertisers, tech companies and others that work with licensed operators but who are also providing the same services to the illegal market.”

He then took aim at tech companies which help to facilitate illegal gambling.

“If you are using the same suppliers, such as web hosting companies, as the majority of illegal websites, then you are helping to build the illegal market,” he said. “And, if you are marketing your products through platforms, including social media, that also promote illegal online casinos, then you are helping to build the illegal market.”

He then segued to a discussion of Meta, which he said often serves ads for illegal gambling operations – some of which use keywords to describe services that do not participate in the UK’s “Gamstop” service that allows people to self-exclude from use of gambling sites.

If we can find them, then so can Meta: They simply choose not to look

“Companies like Meta will tell you that they don’t tolerate the advertising of illegal sites and will remove them if they are notified about them,” he said. “But that approach suggests that they don’t know about those ads unless alerted. That is simply false.”

His support for that assertion is that Meta provides a searchable library of its advertisers.

“You or I can conduct such a search for ‘not on Gamstop’ sites and see for ourselves how many are currently paying Meta to advertise on their platforms,” he said, and described the results of such searches as “effectively a window into criminality.”

“If we can find them, then so can Meta: They simply choose not to look,” he added.

Miller said the Gambling Commission has tried to engage Meta, but “aside from a few warm words we have got very limited progress.”

“Their suggestion was that we should deploy AI tools ourselves to monitor and find these ads and then report them,” he said, before declaring himself “very surprised if Meta, as one of the world’s largest tech companies is incapable of proactively using their own keyword facility to prevent the advertising of illegal gambling.”

“It could leave you with the impression they are quite happy to turn a blind eye and continue taking money from criminals and scammers until someone shouts about it.”

Miller thinks Meta must decide whose side it is on.

“The consumer and users of your platforms, many of whom are seeking to escape gambling harm? Or the criminals and con artists who are using your platforms to prey on vulnerable people right in front of your eyes and whose clutches you risk pushing those vulnerable people into?” Miller ended his speech with the observation that no actor can defeat illegal gambling by working alone.

“We need to work together to ensure that there is no room for suppliers and other companies who want to benefit from the legitimate industry whilst also actively undermining our collective efforts to tackle illegal gambling operators,” he said. “Government, regulators and industry should no longer tolerate anyone having a foot in both camps. It’s time to work together. It’s time to force them to pick a side.”

A reminder: Meta’s structure means its CEO Mark Zuckerberg holds a majority of voting rights, meaning shareholders cannot vote him out of his job. ®

            <p><strong>The Register | 2026-01-20</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2026/01/20/akamai_ceo_tom_leighton_piracy_interview/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Interview After Cloudflare CEO Matthew Prince recently threatened to disrupt the Winter Olympics to protect free speech after Italian authorities fined his company for not disrupting pirate video streams, rival CDN provider Akamai’s CEO Dr. Tom Leighton fired back with what reads a lot like thinly veiled criticism.

“Companies that have lax attitudes about piracy on their networks brazenly hide behind so-called commitments to ‘free speech’,” he wrote on LinkedIn.

In a subsequent conversation with The Register, he reiterated that argument.

“This is a theft of intellectual property issue,” he said. “Free speech is incredibly important. That’s why it is dangerous to equate this to free speech, which is something to cherish and takes a lot of effort to have. I don’t think you want to encumber that with piracy and I think there is no basis for doing that.”

“The right to free speech is not the right to steal somebody else’s content and distribute it.”

The Register put it to Dr Leighton that those who link the issues often do so in the context of IP address blocking, a practice that can stop a pirate streamer but also take out other netizens whose resources share an IP address thanks to the widespread use of network address translation by hosting companies and clouds.

The CEO retorted that IP blocking and other similar measures aren’t the only way to stop pirate video streams.

“It takes some effort to detect piracy,” he said. “It is easier to just ignore it. And less expensive, and especially if you are making money by ignoring it.”

Dr Leighton said Akamai will not allow pirates to use its platform and will always act to crimp illegal streams. The Register asked what the company would do if a legitimate client fell victim to an attack that saw their infrastructure hijacked to perform piracy alongside other workloads.

The CEO said Akamai has experienced just such an incident.

“You get in contact with that customer right away,” he said. “Generally, they are very interested in taking it down because they do not want to be involved. They are very appreciative that we brought it to their attention.”

Dr Leighton suggested Akamai customers will welcome such interventions even if they take place in jurisdictions which, like Italy, require platforms to take down pirate streams within 30 minutes of receiving a notification about distribution of illegal content.

The Register suggested that the prevalence of cyberattacks, and the persistence displayed by pirates, means businesses will need to roster staff to respond to takedown requests at all hours of the day or night.

Akamai already has its own technology to detect and deter pirates, which involves content owners watermarking live streams and issuing tokens that identify each authorized viewer. When tokens don’t match, the company can easily identify a dodgy stream.

However, Dr Leighton admitted that Akamai can’t stop piracy alone and said the fact that some profit from piracy – either by charging for illicit streams or using the lure of them to find victims for other scams and crimes – mean a wider response has become necessary.

“This public-private partnership is essential to create a ‘deterrence by design’ environment where the risks of operating a piracy ring far outweigh the rewards,” he wrote on LinkedIn.

The Register therefore asked the CEO to imagine a summit at which major governments, content owners, film and television studios, music labels, major cloud providers and telcos convene to discuss a common approach to piracy – and to comment on what would be a satisfying and effective outcome from such a summit.

Dr Leighton didn’t have a specific answer beyond a common agreement “to get this stopped.”

“There is reasonable technology that makes a big dent,” he said, but added “nothing is perfect. And the challenge is there are some entities who are not incented to engage in that kind of dialogue, and then enforcement.” ®

One field in which Dr Leighton thinks Akamai can make a difference working alone is advancing the cause of AI, especially at the edge, through Linode – the cloud operator it acquired in 2022.

Linode now offers an inferencing cloud built around Nvidia GPUs. Dr Leighton expressed a belief that agentic AI will soon become popular and will be most effective and satisfying if the inferencing infrastructure that powers it runs in locations physically close to users.

“We are setting up the infrastructure to support that,” he told The Register, and said Akamai aspires to install it in around 100 cities across the world.

Akamai’s Linode-powered edge inferencing offering will likely rely on CPUs and older GPUs, because distributed sites are not suitable for Nvidia’s power-hungry and heated accelerators. The company therefore expects to deploy its edge inferencing kit alongside, or close to, the same points of presence Akamai uses for its content delivery network – a choice Dr Leighton found a satisfying validation of the company’s founding ideas to bring content closer to users – but not to pirates. ®

            <div id="article-text">Micron has found a way to add new DRAM manufacturing capacity in a hurry by acquiring a chipmaking campus from Taiwanese outfit Powerchip Semiconductor Manufacturing Corporation (PSMC).

The two companies announced the deal last weekend. Micron’s version of events says it’s signed a letter of intent to acquire Powerchip’s entire P5 site in Tongluo, Taiwan, for total cash consideration of US$1.8 billion.

“The acquisition includes an existing 300 mm fab cleanroom of 300,000 square feet and will further position Micron to address growing global demand for memory solutions,” the company stated, adding that the company “expects this acquisition to contribute to meaningful DRAM wafer output beginning in the second half of calendar 2027.”

Powerchip’s take on the deal includes news that it will establish a long-term foundry relationship with Micron “on DRAM advanced packaging wafer manufacturing.”

The deal means PSMC will leave the Tongluo site and move the production lines it operates there to another of its facilities in the city of Hsinchu. PSMC has assured its foundry customers it can do this without disrupting its operations, but also says it plans to “phase out low-margin products to reduce reliance on mature process foundry services” and build more products for AI applications.

That’s a remarkable decision given that PSMC opened the Tongluo site less than two years ago.

In its May 2024 ’Hooray, we’re open!’ announcement, PSMC said it invested more than NT$300 billion (US$9.5 billion) on the facility, and that it had capacity to produce 50,000 12-inch wafers per month under 55, 40 and 28 nanometer technology nodes. The company also scoped a second fab on the site to produce 2 nanometer chips.

Nineteen months later, the company is walking away from Tongluo and the legacy chip business and has seemingly taken a financial hit along the way.

Micron says the acquisition “complements … ongoing global expansion plans as the company invests to meet long-term demand from its customers.” The company is already building new memory fabs – it announced a new one in New York State just last Friday – and late last year told investors that new datacenter builds to house AI infrastructure have created a “sharp increase” in demand forecast for memory and storage that semiconductor companies won’t be able to meet for the foreseeable future.

That collision of supply and demand has sent memory prices soaring and created an environment in which Micron was able to pre-sell all the high-bandwidth memory it will produce in 2026.

Manufacturers of PCs, servers, GPUs, and smartphones have warned the cost of their wares must rise along with the cost of memory.

This deal may make matters worse for more buyers, because PSMC used the Tongluo site to make legacy DRAM products – the kind of memory used in less advanced products. With the company now exiting the legacy chip biz, that memory will also become more scarce, giving the laws of supply and demand another moment in which to work their way on markets. ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Seven out of ten C-suite leaders see a life beyond ERP as businesses have come to know it, but are divided on what the future holds for this big-ticket item critical to organizational performance.

Research conducted by Censuswide among 4,295 CFOs, CISOs, CIOs, and CEOs worldwide found the majority of organizations (70 percent) do not see traditional ERP as the future.

However, opinion is divided on where to go next. Thirty-six percent say they think traditional ERP will become obsolete in favor of a &quot;composable, modular, flexible, API-driven, best-of-breed model.&quot; Meanwhile, 33 percent think the future lies in &quot;agentic ERP [with] autonomous, AI-driven decision-making,&quot; according to the study commissioned by Rimini Street, a provider of third-party support services for Oracle and SAP software.

Rimini Street CTO Eric Helmer said the first option was better for organizations trying to move from purely historical reporting into real-time decision support across a number of business applications including ERP.

&quot;You can put all the AI within that one particular vendor, which means that you are relying on that vendor to give you those particular outcomes. But in order to be able to do that, it&#39;s a complete rip and replace of everything that you have today, and then to move on to their subscription-based cloud,&quot; he said.

However, he argued the value of the ERP, in terms of AI agents, lies in the data, rather than the application.

&quot;If you come to that conclusion, then the version of that ERP becomes quite irrelevant, because you have the keys to the kingdom already today. Instead of looking at the ERP as the place to put your AI aspirations, start thinking of more of a data source. You take the AI outside of the ERP, you ingest that data, and you do the beautiful things,&quot; he said.

According to the survey, the vast majority of C-suite execs (97 percent) were satisfied their current ERP systems met their business requirements for the most part, dispelling the idea that users are in any rush to get to the latest SaaS platforms.

In a market dominated by Oracle and SAP, users are also frustrated by vendor lock-in around their largest chunks of enterprise software: 35 percent of senior managers interviewed cited vendor lock-in with limited flexibility and forced upgrades and migrations as some of the most frustrating pressures.

In November, Rimini Street client Kingfisher – which operates 2,000 European retail stores including UK brands Screwfix and B&Q – eschewed an SAP upgrade and move to the cloud in favor of using third-party support to shift its existing application to the cloud and build analytics and new services around it.

However, the path Kingfisher has chosen – and Rimini Street prefers – leaves out the 33 percent from the survey who see the future as putting AI agents into the ERP platform, as vendors like SAP and Oracle prefer.

Dixie John, senior director of ERP strategy at Gartner, told The Register that while using third-party support to extend existing applications might be a good tactical option in the short or medium term, eventually organizations will need to upgrade their ERP. This is because certain foundational capabilities – cash management, accounts receivable, invoicing – work better in a single application.

Users are becoming more risk-averse to a mix-and-match approach to building an AI agent system and are looking to reduce risk by opting for solutions from their existing vendors.

&quot;It gives users the opportunity of a low-risk project if, in some cases, the software is coming as part of an update, they may not even be paying [extra] for it,&quot; Gartner&#39;s John-David Lovelock told us last week. ®

            <div id="article-text">A Jordanian national faces sentencing in the US after pleading guilty to acting as an initial access broker (IAB) for various cyberattacks.

Feras Khalil Ahmad Albashiti, 40, admitted to facilitating cyberattacks on at least 50 companies stateside.

Residing in Georgia at the time, Albashiti&#39;s crimes were carried out in 2023. On May 19 of that year, while working under the alias r1z, he unwittingly sold an undercover FBI agent access to the businesses in exchange for cryptocurrency.

The agent spotted that Albashiti was advertising access to the companies that all used one of two firewall products. After making the purchase totaling $5,000, the IAB sent a list of IP addresses, usernames, and instructions on how to bypass the firewalls to gain access to the victims&#39; networks.

Building a larger case against the man, the undercover agent later gave Albashiti a further $15,000 in exchange for a copy of an effective EDR-disabling malware, and separately purchased malware for elevating user privileges.

During the process of the EDR killer purchase, the undercover agent asked Albashiti to demonstrate the malware worked by connecting to an FBI-controlled server. In doing so, Albashiti revealed his IP address, which also implicated him in a ransomware attack on an unnamed US manufacturer that led to $50 million in losses, according to court documents.

US State Department records helped law enforcement identify Albashiti. Prosecutors said the Jordanian national applied for a visa in 2016 using the same email address used to register the r1z account on the cybercrime forum he used to advertise his illicit wares.

The same email address was also connected to a Google Pay account, which in turn had various credit cards connected to it. The names associated with the Google email address, Google Pay account, and credit cards, pointed to Albashiti as the man behind r1z.

Albashiti was extradited from Georgia in July 2024, and is scheduled for sentencing on May 11, 2026.

He faces a maximum prison sentence of ten years, plus a potential maximum fine of $250,000. ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The promise of Just the Browser sounds good. Rather than fork one of the big-name browsers, just run a tiny script that turns off all the bits and functions you don&#39;t want.

Just the Browser is a new project by developer Corbin Davenport. It aims to fight the rising tide of undesirable browser features such as telemetry, LLM bot features billed as AI, and sponsored content by a clever lateral move. It uses the enterprise management features built into the leading browsers to turn these things off.

The concept is simple and appealing. Enough people want de-enshittified browsers that there are multiple forks of the big names. For Firefox, there are Waterfox and Zen as well as LibreWolf and Floorp, and projects based off much older versions of the codebase such as Pale Moon. Most people, though, tend to use Chrome and there are lots of browsers based on its Chromium upstream too, including Microsoft Edge, the Chinese-owned Opera, and from some of the people behind the original Norwegian Opera browser, Vivaldi.

Another fairly prominent Chrome-based browser is also the reason why Davenport&#39;s name might be familiar. Back in 2023, he wrote an elegant list of reasons to stop using Brave Browser – an article that The Reg FOSS desk has previously cited. Those with long memories may have encountered Davenport&#39;s work nearly a decade earlier, though. Way back in 2014, The Register described him as an enfant terrible for running Windows 95 on a smartwatch.

We are regular users of some of these alternative browsers ourselves, but maintaining such a fork is a big job. Modern browsers are vast. Chromium weighs in at about 48.5 million lines of code and Mozilla Firefox isn&#39;t much smaller at 44.75 million.

Just disabling the unwanted features does seem like a much easier route – and because these policies are intended for human managers, they are quite readable. The entirety of the Firefox changes that Just the Browser makes is:

The browsers will tell you what policies are in effect. In Firefox, enter about:policies into the URL bar; in browsers based on Chrome, it&#39;s chrome://policy/. After you&#39;ve applied a policy to your settings, your browser&#39;s dialog box may include a warning. For us, Chrome said:

Your browser is managed by your organization

If your browser already is managed by an organization, of course, you&#39;re going to have to persuade the powers that be. Good luck with that, and if you find a way, let us know in the comments.

The Just the Browser site supports Windows, macOS, and Linux, and offers installation instructions that boil down to &quot;paste this into a terminal.&quot; For older techie types, this is an unwelcome move – but no problem, you can also download the settings files, look at them for yourself – as you can see above, they&#39;re not very long – and apply them to your browser manually. The code is all available on GitHub.

We like the idea. So long as the browsers continue to have policy settings that control such things, and so long as they really do honor them, it&#39;s tough to see a downside here. ®

﻿As the company spends a huge amount of money on infrastructure, OpenAI is working to close the gap on what AI can do and how people actually use it.

OpenAI plans to focus on “practical adoption” of AI in 2026, according to a blog post from CFO Sarah Friar. As the company spends a huge amount of money on infrastructure, OpenAI is working on “closing the gap” on what AI can do and how people actually use it. “The opportunity is large and immediate, especially in health, science, and enterprise, where better intelligence translates directly into better outcomes.”

Much of the blog post, titled “A business that scales with the value of intelligence,” is about how OpenAI has evolved since it launched ChatGPT and how it has scaled up its business. The company’s weekly active user and daily active user metrics “continue to produce all-time highs,” thanks to a “flywheel” across “compute, frontier research, products, and monetization,” according to Friar. However, the company is also investing a lot on infrastructure, having made about $1.4 trillion in infrastructure commitments as of November of last year.

OpenAI announced last week that it will be bringing ads to the platform soon and launched the cheaper ChatGPT Go subscription worldwide. Where OpenAI’s business model goes next will “extend beyond what we already sell,” Friar says:

As intelligence moves into scientific research, drug discovery, energy systems, and financial modeling, new economic models will emerge. Licensing, IP-based agreements, and outcome-based pricing will share in the value created. That is how the internet evolved. Intelligence will follow the same path.

This system requires discipline. Securing world-class compute requires commitments made years in advance, and growth does not move in a perfectly smooth line. At times, capacity leads usage. At other times, usage leads capacity. We manage that by keeping the balance sheet light, partnering rather than owning, and structuring contracts with flexibility across providers and hardware types. Capital is committed in tranches against real demand signals. That lets us lean forward when growth is there without locking in more of the future than the market has earned.

Perhaps some of the “practical adoption” for ChatGPT could come in the form of the hardware devices OpenAI is building in partnership with Jony Ive, with the first device potentially being shown off later this year.

            <div id="article-text">As Homeland Security’s siege on Minneapolis enters its third week, locals are volunteering for patrol shifts, protesting in the streets, and keeping one another up to date in group texts.

I live in Minneapolis. I grew up not far from here, in a suburb of St. Paul; after stints on both coasts, my wife and I settled here to raise our daughters in a freezing state that had always welcomed us warmly. As the ongoing occupation by over 3,000 ICE agents stretches into its third week — with no clear end in sight — I’ve received a steady string of messages from increasingly concerned friends across the country. They all start the same way: Uh… is this really as bad as it looks from the outside?

My answer to that question is easy: no, it’s worse. Not since the pandemic has my daily life been ruptured in such a frightening and surreal fashion. Then, at least, there was a semblance of the country being united. Morons who rallied against masks and vaccines aside, most Americans could at least agree that the world would be a better place if Covid-19 didn’t exist.

There’s no such comfort with ICE, which is quite literally a hostile, heavily armed, masked police force violently occupying Minneapolis. No one — certainly not the ICE agents themselves — is even really bothering with the pretext that they’re here to make the city safer. This is Donald Trump’s revenge campaign, and they’re the foot soldiers.

Unfortunately, their obvious incompetence and buffoonery does not make them less dangerous. The killing of Renee Good was bad enough, but the blatant lies DHS Secretary Kristi Noem spun about the incident — and the FBI’s refusal to share evidence that would allow the state of Minnesota to investigate the death of one of its own citizens — made it clear, to both sides, that ICE would face no consequences for anything they did, at least not while Trump is in the White House.

In the days since, ICE agents have acted accordingly. We know they are often under-trained, wear masks to avoid being identified, and have the unquestioning support of an administration almost openly pushing for violence in the streets of Minneapolis. At the time I’m writing this, Trump is still toying with invoking the Insurrection Act and deploying 1,500 paratroopers to the city. How worried am I about what ICE will do to those who oppose its tactics? Enough that I considered whether I should publish this story anonymously.

And so the second question people are texting me — Are YOU okay? — is harder to answer. I guess that’s because the answer is no. Call me naïve, but despite plenty of evidence for the ghoulishness and cynicism of the Trump administration and its operatives, I was not prepared for them to unleash this level of chaos and violence on my city.

The presence of ICE is not an abstraction to the people who live here. It’s a constant threat requiring constant vigilance. Our public schools were closed because the state government could not guarantee students would be safe. Many stores and restaurants, including 80 percent of immigrant-owned businesses, are not open, protecting both staff and patrons from the threat of an ICE raid. Many nonwhite Minnesotans — regardless of whether they are citizens or not — are essentially sheltering in place, skipping grocery runs and doctors’ appointments to stay at home, where ICE (theoretically) needs a judicial warrant to harass them.

There is a right-wing trope, frequently employed by Trump, that anyone who resists ICE must be a paid protestor. Of course, the reality is the opposite. Many of us have families, most of us have jobs, and all of us have bills to pay. None of that has changed, but the task of protecting our community still requires many, many unpaid hours. As a white U.S. citizen, I’m one of the “lucky” ones: ICE may still detain me, as they have many other lawful protesters, but I’m much less likely to be actively targeted. I’ve also been lucky in another sense: So far, I haven’t run into any truly bad situations with my young children in tow. But I expect that luck to run out soon.

Over the past two weeks, I’ve become a volunteer driver, shuttling nonwhite people between their homes and their jobs. My passengers put up the hoods on their winter coats before they get out of the car to hide their faces, walking into homes still bearing cheerful Christmas lights and wreaths. I don’t leave until they’re behind locked doors.

With no alternatives, parents have gotten organized via platforms like Signal and WhatsApp. Working in tandem with people around my community, I’ve taken shifts as a security guard, waiting outside schools, daycares, and community centers to send a rapid-response alert if ICE arrives. I’ve marched and fundraised, while boycotting stores like Target, a Minnesota-based company without the courage to issue even a tepid, mealy mouthed defense of Minnesotans.

None of what I’m doing is enough. But all of it, I reassure myself, is better than nothing. The most heartening thing about this deeply disturbing moment is seeing how consistently and forcefully Minnesotans of all demographics have been pushing back. It has been galvanizing and radicalizing in ways I’m not sure anyone outside the city can truly understand. High schoolers across the Twin Cities metro area have organized walkouts. Parents who might normally be busy with PTA duties are patrolling their neighborhoods, trailing ICE agents while honking car horns, and blowing whistles to warn the community of their presence. My father-in-law, a devout Catholic in his 70s, made a cardboard sign that read “Love Thy Neighbor” and joined the thousands who rallied against ICE on a frigid afternoon in Powderhorn Park.

This has been an especially difficult year for Minneapolis. The assassination of Democratic state representative Melissa Hortman, and Donald Trump’s characteristically callous response to it, is still an open wound. Many yards still contain pink lawn signs created as a sign of community support after the deadly shooting at Annunciation Catholic School in August. The murder of George Floyd, never far in the background of the city’s collective memory, has returned to the surface, as one needless murder in the streets recalls another. How much can one city take?

I guess we’ll all find out. Over the past two weeks, I wake up more enraged than exhausted and go to bed more exhausted than enraged. I’m eating more restaurant takeout than I should, but it feels like a good time to support local businesses — even if many of them remain closed. I bought a pack of whistles and texted some neighbors to see if anyone needed one. Nobody took me up on it; they’d all bought packs of whistles too.

The community is united in outrage, action, and, remarkably, even good humor. A variety of local businesses, including the Detroit-style pizza hub Wrecktangle and the sex shop Smitten Kitten, have become hubs for resources and community activism. We share ICE sightings over Signal and trawl r/Minneapolis. When conservative influencer Jake Lang — pardoned by Trump after spending four years in prison for assaulting Capitol police officers with a baseball bat — announced an anti-Muslim march in Cedar-Riverside, group chats across the Twin Cities lit up with the same Tom Hardy GIF. We’ve already experienced enough to know when ICE and their allies are trying to bait us.

We talk, optimistically, about the money ICE is burning through every day and how difficult it will be for them to sustain this full-scale assault in the weeks and months to come. We hope that Trump’s distaste for anything complicated means he’ll get frustrated by the stalemate between ICE and the people of Minneapolis or that his toddler-esque obsession with new, shiny things means he’ll just get bored and order his minions to do something else.

We also know that we’ll win. Time is on our side. ICE may have the inflated salaries and the backing of a tyrannical federal government, but we’re the ones who live here, and as the city’s greatest musician Prince once said, the cold keeps the bad people out. And when the ICE agents finally take off their masks, leave their shitty chain hotels, and fly back to wherever they were before they came to terrorize us, we’ll still be here.

Here’s the last thing I text anyone who checks in with me: Wherever you are, get organized now. Figure out who your likeminded neighbors are. Set up your Signal chats. Get some whistles (I can spare a few if you need them). This administration has made it clear that Minneapolis is just the beginning, and when they come to your city, you’ll want to be ready.</div>

            <div id="article-text">﻿The proposed venue would be one of the first smaller-scale Spheres with seating for 6,000 people instead of over 17,000.

﻿The proposed venue would be one of the first smaller-scale Spheres with seating for 6,000 people instead of over 17,000.

Sphere Entertainment, the company behind the eye-catching interactive venue in Las Vegas, has announced its “intent to develop” another Sphere in Maryland that will be located 15 minutes south of Washington, DC. A timeline and exact location haven’t been finalized, but the Maryland Sphere would be the company’s second venue in the US, following plans to build a Sphere in Abu Dhabi announced in October 2024.

The second US sphere would be built in an area known as National Harbor in Prince George’s County, Maryland. Located along the Potomac River, National Harbor currently features a convention center, multiple hotels, restaurants, and shops. While Abu Dhabi plans to build a sphere as large as the one in Las Vegas, the National Harbor venue would be one of the first mini-Sphere venues announced last March.

Its capacity would be limited to 6,000 seats instead of over 17,000. But the smaller Sphere would still be hard to miss with an exterior LED exosphere for showcasing the “artistic and branded content” that helped make the original sphere a unique part of the Las Vegas skyline.

The inside of the mini-Sphere will feature a high-resolution 16,000 by 16,000 pixel wrap-around screen, the company’s immersive sound technology, haptic seating, and “4D environmental effects.” For the AI-enhanced version of The Wizard of Oz currently playing in Las Vegas, audiences experience effects like wind, fog, smells, and apples falling from the ceiling.

The mini-Sphere will potentially also be cheaper to build than the $2.3 billion original, but its construction is contingent on the “receipt of certain governmental incentives and approvals from Prince George’s County and the State of Maryland.” Sphere Entertainment says the project “would utilize a combination of public and private funding, including approximately $200 million in state, local, and private incentives,” but would potentially generate millions of dollars in revenue for the country and state while supporting over 4,700 jobs once it opens.

Bungie is pricing its upcoming extraction shooter at $39.99.

Bungie is putting an official date on Marathon today, its delayed extraction shooter. The slick-looking shooter from the makers of Halo and Destiny was originally set to release in September, but will now launch on March 5th. Bungie will launch Marathon on Xbox Series S / X, PS5, and PC, priced at $39.99.

Bungie initially delayed Marathon in June last year following plenty of alpha test feedback. The studio recently held playtests that included new features like proximity chat and an option to solo queue into games.

Marathon is set in a sci-fi universe in 2850, where players take on the role of a Runner to scavenge what’s left behind. As a Runner, you fight in a crew of up to three players across a variety of zones and points of interest. Marathon is a PvPvE environment, so players will be fighting creatures on planets as well as other players. If you die during a run, you’ll drop your gear. But if you survive, your loot moves with you to future runs so you get more powerful gear and level up.

Bungie’s delay to Marathon means it is now launching months after ARC Raiders, an extraction shooter from the makers of The Finals that has consistently been in the top five most-played games on Steam since its launch in late October. Bungie had originally planned to launch Marathon ahead of ARC Raiders.

            <div id="article-text">Razer’s Min-Liang Tan on gaming’s AI backlash, partnering with Grok, and creating anime waifus.

We’re back to start the year off with a very special live interview with Razer CEO Min-Liang Tan, which we taped in front of a terrific audience at Brooklyn Bowl in Las Vegas during CES.

Razer is obviously best known for making mice, keyboards, and gaming PCs in its signature black and bright green, with a smattering of RGB LEDs to set everything off. But the company always makes splashy announcements at CES, and this year was no different — and along with the hype, there was plenty of controversy.

This year, Razer earned those splashy headlines and more than a little controversy for something it calls Project Ava, an AI companion that has a physical presence in the real world as an anime hologram that sits in a jar on your desk. Ava is powered by, you guessed it, Elon Musk’s Grok.

There are a lot of choices bundled up in all of that, and Razer can’t really fall back on the “it’s just a prototype” defense. It’s taking $20 “reservations” and entirely expects to ship this thing, potentially even this year. So I spent a good chunk of time in this interview asking Min some very obvious questions, to which I’m not sure I got very satisfying answers.

I really wanted to know if Min and Razer had really thought through the implications of building AI companions, after a string of stories detailing the mental health issues chatbots have caused for so many people. And of course, I wanted to know why Min and Razer had chosen Grok, which is facing outrage around the world for allowing users to create deepfaked pornographic images of real women and children.

Min says they chose Grok for its conversational capabilities. But he was also not very convinced by the notion that products like this always end up being turned into creepy sexual objects, despite an entire year of headlines about AI psychosis and people turning chatbots into romantic partners.

That exchange really set the tone for the rest of my conversation with Min, which focused on why exactly he’s pushing Razer so hard into AI when it does not seem at all clear that the core gamer demographic wants any of this. The gaming community at large has been absolutely rocked by the AI art debate that’s ripped through the broader industry in the past 12 months, with concerns over labor, copyright, and even just experimental AI use in game development putting some of the industry’s most beloved studios into full-blown crisis mode.

Gamers themselves are fairly hostile toward AI, which you can see in the comments on Razer’s own CES AI posts. So I asked Min about that, and how he would know if he had made the right bet here in the face of all this pushback.

As you can tell, there was a lot of back and forth here, and this was a really good conversation. Min and I really dug into some of the biggest issues in tech and gaming, themes that are going to be central throughout 2026. It’s also great to do these kinds of episodes live in front of an audience. I think it’s going to give you a lot to think about.

Okay: Razer CEO Min-Liang Tan. Here we go.

This interview has been lightly edited for length and clarity.

Hello, welcome to Decoder. I’m Nilay Patel, editor-in-chief of The Verge, and Decoder is my show about big ideas and other problems. Today, I’m talking with Razer CEO Min-Liang Tan. Welcome, Min.

Nailed it. Thank you to our audience. We are live at Brooklyn Bowl at CES. I’m very excited to be doing this in front of a live audience. You’re going to hear them throughout the show because Min has no shortage of extremely controversial things to say.

I was promised “extremely controversial.”

I mean, that’s what they told me. Let’s get into it. You’ve made a bunch of announcements here at CES. You’ve obviously been with Razer for a long time. You founded Razer, and you’re over 20 years into the job. The gaming industry is undergoing a lot of turmoil lately because of AI. You’re making huge investments in AI. There’s a hologram waifu we should talk about that you’ve introduced throughout the show.

I actually wanna start with something very basic. I’ve been covering CES for about 20 years as well. Razer loves CES. You love CES.

Every year, there is a huge suite of Razer products announced. There are weird projects and concepts. Why are you so invested in CES? Of all the companies, I think Razer has the most consistent enthusiasm for this show in particular.

It’s odd, and we were just talking about it yesterday. It’s over 20 years at this point in time, and I think we’ve been at CES maybe 15 years or so. And from the very early days at Razer, I remember Pepcom, a massive hall with a little table there, talking about gaming products. Back then, I think we were probably one of the few, if not the only, gaming equipment providers.

It’s really grown for us. I think what has happened is we have a huge online community, people are very passionate about things that we come up with, what’s the latest and greatest, and we’ve really grown this community, and we have all been kind of invested in what we’re gonna be launching at CES. So it kind of started a couple of years ago when we said, “Okay, why don’t we not just bring the stuff that we’re gonna launch, but some of the things that we’ve got cooking in the Razer labs and stuff.”

We brought it to CES, it has been a hit, and we said every year, “Why don’t we bring more of our concept products? Some of which will come to market, some of which do not, and let’s see what the community thinks.” So we’re a company that is for gamers, by gamers. We really like to hear what the community would like to say about our product, and it gives us an opportunity to present the stuff that we’ve got, get the feedback, and then we go back and polish it a little bit.

Well, I’m curious. I mean, this is kind of a meta question about how this show in particular has changed so much over the years. The idea of even having a big tech trade show has gone in and out of favor. If you look at where a lot of the action is this week in Vegas, it’s actually in the Aria and Vdara, where the ad tech people are doing whatever weird stuff they’re doing. I don’t even know what’s going on over there, man. It’s goofy.

This is about getting attention, right? I mean, you launch things at trade shows because the press and creators are here, and you can get a lot of attention. Razer doesn’t need help getting attention. Why still do it here?

Well, it’s an opportunity, I think, for us also to catch up with our partners, friends, and show a little bit of what we have been working on under the hood. But it’s been a tradition of sorts. I think the community expects us to be here. I’d love to see more of these in-person events right now, especially post-pandemic, and what has happened.

From a gaming perspective, we’ve also lost a couple of big events in the year. So it’s a great way to kind of kick it off. It’s a little early in the year for us, though. We wish it would be maybe mid-January or something like that. But it’s a bit of a tradition for us. I hope it continues, I hope it gets bigger along the way, and it’s massive right now. But it’s good fun.

Do you think you’re still getting the same amount of attention from this kind of thing as you would if you just had your own events?

Well, we have our own events, pretty much, but it’s a good opportunity just to catch up with partners. I think that’s been a real opportunity for us. And it’s also a good opportunity for us to kind of bring the rest of our audience along, from the gaming community, who may not necessarily be keen so much on all tech, but they really wanna see what’s the latest and greatest in gaming tech. And that’s what we do.

So let me ask you about the announcements here. There’s an AI headset called Project Motoko.

You’ve got AI PCs for software developers, which is really interesting. I wanna talk to you about that. And then there’s Project Ava, which is a spinning hologram.

Yes. We’ve got Madison also, which is a project that we’ve brought across, which showcases the latest and greatest in immersion technology. We’ve put it into a gaming chair, so that’s a setup for games.

I can’t believe I forgot the chair. The most important.

Yeah, the chair, it’s getting a lot of traction. And a whole lot more, and not just hardware, but software.

So how do you decide what is going to be a real product you’re gonna ship? The AI PCs, I think, are real products you’re definitely gonna ship. That’s just happening. And then here’s the concept, just to get attention and feedback. How do you make that kind of choice?

Actually, we’ve got a labs team internally, which charts and pretty much looks at things far out, in terms of the industry, where we think the industry’s going, and how we can build toward that. In essence, the decision to green-light a project to an actual product is really like, “Is this cool? Do we think it’s gonna do well?” We kind of started with that, with the gaming mouse, right?

We very rarely sit down with the finance people and say, “Oh, do we do projections and things like that?” It’s really more of a “by the seat of our pants” kind of thing. It’s cool, we like it, it’s gonna be fun, we want it for ourselves. I think the real kind of trigger there is, do we want it for ourselves? And if we really want it for ourselves, and we think it’s cool, we’ll bring it to market.

Every year, there’s always some project; some of them come out, some of them don’t come out. One year, you announced a respirator that got you into a lot of trouble, and you had to recall the product. How do you make the call of, “Okay, this project, it’s out, it’s successful, it’s doing what we want it to do, we’re gonna keep investing,” versus “this was a one-off.” What’s the metric of success there?

Well, scaling it. I think scaling it is definitely something that we would like to do. And sometimes we’re really early. For example, I think over a decade ago we built a complete gaming PC in a handheld. For that matter, we brought it to market at the same time. Today, we’ve seen handhelds out there, and we haven’t launched our handheld, for example, at this point.

I think for us, when we launch a product, we look at the attraction for it. You know, is this something that we want? Do we wanna invest in the next generation? Do we wanna kind of provide a roadmap across to it? So we essentially work very closely with the community.

We keep talking about “for gamers, by gamers,” but we really believe in that. We’ve got a really big fan base that’s very passionate. Everyone’s got an opinion. We love hearing opinions. We’ve got social media, we chat with them often, so on and so forth. That’s what really guides us, and we really let the community guide what we build for the future.

All right, so now I have to ask you about Project Ava.

Did you say to your team, “I want a holographic anime waifu on my desk”? You say that the metric is “what we want.” Who was like, “I want this”?

Sure. So actually, yeah, somewhat. Well, not so much in the specific words, “I want an anime waifu,” and things like that. But we did hack together a holographic projector to have a character there. We had ideas like that in the past, where we’ve created holographic projectors for game companies. But back in the day, to say, “Hey, look, is there a way that we can do a holographic representation of some of your latest characters?” and stuff like that.

With AI, we were now able to get that personality there and have conversational AI coming through. I think the tipping point for us was really not just making great hardware, and not just having great software, but also, now with great intelligence, I think, coming out together with it. And it’s that premise of being able to have a semi-physical representation of an avatar, to me being able to chat, as opposed to clicking a button or typing on something, and having a little thing over there.

It’s really exciting in our imaginations for ourselves, you know? It’s cool. We’ve always had that, whether it’s a game like a super AI in Halo, like Cortana, for example. So it’s a little bit of sci-fi, us growing up always wanting something cool like that, and so we said, “Hey, it’s a great concept,” and I think the community loves it.

Are you aware of the very common trope about actually building superintelligence from sci-fi movies? The one that’s “you should not build the Torment Nexus?”

Well, for us, I think in this case it’s more… Well, I’m familiar with that, of course.

Yeah, yeah. But, I mean, with the guardrails… That is also, I think, on a broader level, from an AI discussion and things like that, trust and safety is one of the things that we do look at internally at the company. But specifically for Ava, it was just cool. It was just awesome to be able to have a product like that, and hopefully we will.

So is Ava going to come out? Because I think that my understanding, or my reaction to this product, changes based on whether it’s actually coming out or if this is just a concept that people can react to. But you’re taking pre-orders for it. It’s like 20 bucks to pre-order it.

Yes, we’re taking reservations for it at this point in time.

We plan to put it out, but we do want to get as much feedback, to hear what the concerns are, right? Are there things that we can do better? What’s cool? What are the characters that we would like to get on? We’d also like to get the feedback from many of the game partners, at the same time, to do really specific character models, so on and so forth. And then finally, I think on the trust and safety part, we also wanna make sure that we take that into consideration. Are there things that we need to know? We’re working with our model partners at the same time.

I would say that there’s a pretty significant disconnect between saying you care about trust and safety and partnering with Grok, which is in the middle of a deepfake porn scandal. As we speak, as we’re sitting here, Grok is undressing people left and right. I’m confident that we will be undressed by the end of this podcast.

Can you care about trust and safety, and also partner with Grok?

Well, I think for Grok, you know… We picked Grok also because it’s got the best conversational AI at this point, for us. At least from a conversation, personality side of things, and that’s one of the things that we looked at from a tech perspective. Now, ultimately, however, we do see Ava as an open platform, right? If somebody wants to be able to use a different model, it’s one of the things that we’re taking into consideration. And we are multi-model, right? But I think from a perspective of an avatar, from a conversational AI for CES, we feel that Grok has a really great conversational AI model at this point. So that’s one of the reasons why we picked Grok.

Grok, also made by Elon Musk, who has his own anime waifu ideas, I would say. There’s something there that is, you know, not necessarily just trust and safety. The idea that you would have a pet on your desk that looks like a person, that can talk to you, that’s a big door to open for a lot of people. Are you worried about that at all?

Well, the doors have been open since Tamagotchi.

I think there’s a pretty big step difference between… Like my daughter has a Tamagotchi. I’m never worried that this thing is alive.

The Tamagotchi has not driven anyone into psychosis.

Sure. But from a virtual perspective, and as a gamer, we’ve interacted with NPCs and stuff like that. And of course, NPCs are getting smarter with AI, and I do hope they get smarter. It gets more engaging. And I think we’re still in the early days. Now, the question, I think, where it’s going to lead to is something that we need to discover, right? And, of course, we need to discover it in a responsible manner to figure out how we do that, and put the right guardrails in. What do we do in terms of AI, in terms of this? That’s something that we’re learning.

So building great hardware, I think, is part of it. Grok is powering this for us at this point in time, and this is something that we feel, from a conversational perspective, they do an incredible job at. Now, over and above what else can we do to ensure that, ultimately, when we do launch the product, how do we make sure that it’s going to do the right things and be able to converse and be the great companion that we want it to be?

This is very much what I mean by saying I react to it differently when it’s just a concept, and it opens the door to these conversations, versus you are going to sell this thing to people. And I think when you sell it to people, the responsibility skyrockets. We’ve all looked at what’s happened with OpenAI models over the last year or so. People have fallen in love with them. Famously, Bing proposed to journalist Kevin Roose on the front page of The New York Times. People are having relationships with these products. They are being driven to very negative outcomes.

Do you think that you have to do something else to make sure that doesn’t happen with Ava, who will be represented in human-like form on your desk? Like the opportunity to have a relationship is gonna change, right? And from what I have been told, from our reporters, Razer people are saying, “We don’t want this to be a companion in that way.” OpenAI said that about ChatGPT, and yet, here we are. So what have you learned from that already?

So we work closely with the model providers. I think this is something that we work closely on with them, with respect to that. We do talk to them often about what the plans are for the future, with respect to this. But I think what is clear is that these are still early days, right? It is still new for us to discover. I’m sure that there will be concerns or issues that will come about, and evolving what’s happening for technology is something that we do.

Now, maybe it’s even a hardware lock that we need to put in. We don’t know, right? Or it’s more software guardrails that we have to put into place at this point in time. That’s one of the reasons why we decided to put it as a concept first out there, to get the feedback. And we’re not gonna be able to think of everything, but we would like to be able to get as much thought, concern, and care into the product before we actually launch it, which is why we’ve also intentionally, in a very intentional and deliberate manner, said, “We don’t know when we’re gonna launch this.” We really do not.

I would suspect, for us, it will be a phased approach to a certain extent, with dev kits out there first to be able to discover more. Someone’s gonna be able to do more with it, perhaps, to load up different models and to have it say things that we may not necessarily want it to say, and we’ll find out. And then, accordingly, we’ll just grow the product.

I understand all this, but you’re taking the money, right? You’re taking the pre-orders. Why take pre-orders if you don’t think you’re ready?

So what we have actually said is that these are reservations. They’re not pre-orders, per se. So, ultimately, when we do launch the product, and it could be a long way out, by then, because of the specs… We have not disclosed the actual specs of the product, and even, for example, which character models, or even which model it’s gonna be running at this point in time. We’re leaving that absolutely open.

And of course, at the end of the day, if somebody says, “Look, this isn’t the product that I thought it was going to be,” that’s fine. Cancel the reservation, and we’ll remain open and see how the product evolves at that point in time.

Are you ready for a customer, a few years from now, falling in love with their hologram on your desk that you have provided?

I don’t think that’s how we would want to design the product.

That’s what happens with all these tools.

I suppose we literally do not know, right? I use the example when I play a game, and I’m really invested in the game, I really enjoy it, and I feel a sense of loss... Well, I wouldn’t call it unhappiness, but loss when I finish a game. But it’s a great game. I’m fully invested in a movie, I’m fully invested in a game. Is that how we see it? Perhaps, right?

We want to create products that people care about, whether that’s a gaming mouse, a laptop, or whatever software platforms. We want people to care about it. I don’t necessarily think that we want somebody to fall in love with one of our products and marry them. It might happen. Who knows? It could.

There are other CEOs who come on this show, they’re like, “You should marry my AI,” and straightforwardly say these things to me.

The reality is, some people are having their romantic lives rocked because a cloud service got deprecated, and then you’re gonna have to deal with that. I’m just saying, these are the questions that are coming for you once you put a character that people can have an emotional relationship with.

Well, I would say that potentially that could happen, but that’s definitely not something we plan to build the product toward. I mean, we have, for example, people really passionate about Razer products, right? Some of them have come to me, and they have said, “Look, I’m so passionate about this product, it’s part of my life. I’m gonna tattoo the product on myself,” and things like that. We didn’t plan to do that.

But we did, however, plan to make the best possible product. We put incredible amounts of care and concern, I think, in terms of design. And that’s what we plan to do with Ava at the same time, or Motoko, or Madison, or any of the products that we bring to the market.

One more question on this, and then I’m gonna ask you the Decoder questions and talk about the rest of your AI investment, which is pretty substantial. You said you’re working with the model partners, and that is how you’re thinking about trust and safety. Is xAI a good partner when it comes to trust and safety, as it relates to Grok? Because I’m looking at the product you’re shipping today, and I would say, “No.”

Sure. So I think, and I speak broadly, I think, for all of the partners that we’ve got. I think for the vast majority of all the models out there, I think there’s, of course, a lot of focus in terms of intelligence, really trying to get to that point, but trust and safety really is one of the things that pretty much all our partners really do care about. And that’s one of the reasons why… Each model, I think, excels in different ways at the same time. And I think for us, we really wanna find the best possible model. And ultimately, in what shape or form we ship at the end of the day, that’s one of the things that we will take into consideration.

Is xAI a good partner when it comes to trust and safety?

Specifically, I don’t really like to comment on that at this point in time because I don’t have enough information, I think, right now. I really don’t. My focus to date has been more in terms of what’s the best conversational model that we’ve got, and they’re great, they’re fantastic.

Again, I suspect we’ll be undressed within the next 45 minutes. They’ve got one idea, and they’re good at it.

Let me ask you the Decoder questions. If you’ve got a trick, you gotta play the hits, you know? Let me ask the Decoder questions ‘cause I think that’s gonna lead into some of the big investments you’re making, and the change that’s coming to Razer as a company over the next few years. You’re really invested in design. You’re a product designer, that’s some of your background. How is Razer structured in a way that lets you stay focused on design?

So I focus on product at the company. We’ve got a really pretty flat structure at Razer. I’ve got about 40, 50 direct reports. We really work as a team. And the entire company is really focused, I think, in terms of product first. You know, that has always been the mantra for the organization, but we’ve got a really great team, very talented team members. And everyone has worked together for a while. We’ve got team members who have been there for the last 20 years together with us, growing alongside us.

I would say that the guiding north star for us is just about the gamers. We’ve been consistent in that respect, despite the fact that in the very early days, gaming or gamers were not considered a big industry or demographic. But we’ve been laser-focused in terms of that as we’ve grown. Even with the industry growing at this point in time, the opportunities for us to go like, “Hey, why don’t you do productivity at the same time? Why don’t we go into this other area?” And stuff like that. We’ve just said, “Look, we know what we’re good at.” We remain focused on it. We align the team members all the time, and that’s how we are structured.

When I say structure, I mean literally organized. Does everybody report to you? Where do all those 2000 people go?

No. In the traditional structure, we’ve got our operations and supply chain. We’ve got legal, so on and so forth. But we’ve got a pretty flat, I think, management team structure, and we don’t have multiple layers from that perspective. And we consistently keep a very single-minded focus to say that, “Look, the product’s always the most important. The customer, in our case, the gamer, is always the most important for us.” And pretty much we ask ourselves the question, right? If there’s no direction or management mandate when it comes down to this, just figure it out. Like, what would the customer want, what would the gamer want? That’s what we do.

You’re primarily based in Singapore. I know you come back and forth a lot. Where is most of the company based?

Well, we’re everywhere. A third of our business is in the US, a third in Europe, and a third in Asia at this point in time. So we’ve got team members spread out. We’ve got close to 20 offices worldwide. We’re dual headquartered in Irvine and Singapore.

When I think about the market of gamers, we’re here, obviously, in the United States. It’s very obviously focused on what this market wants. Gaming is growing in China at a high rate, right? We’re adding more gamers in other places. When you say, “We’re focused on the gamers,” the gamers in different regions want different things. How do you make those decisions? How do you decide which needs are gonna drive your roadmaps or your design ideas?

Exactly that. You know, the gamers from, or the needs from, every country or region that we’ve got… We’ve got team members from design in each of the various regions, and we do focus on pretty much two constituents, the way that we see it. The first of which would be the game developers. That’s who we work with, very closely with. And then on the other end of the spectrum, we’ve got the gamers. And what we do is focus on what the gamers want, what the game developers want, and we see ourselves as the link in between. And we keep both as happy as we can.

This brings me to the other Decoder question I ask everybody on the show. How do you make decisions? Do you have a framework? Do you have an organized way of making decisions?

I think we are dictated by what we feel the customer wants. That’s what dictates our decisions at any point in time. We talk to the gamers, and when we say “talk to the gamers,” it could be directly through social media, it could be through our customer base, it could be through our sales and marketing team, and things like that. And anecdotally, we figure out, is this what we want? And if this is something that they are keen or passionate about, we then make the decision to say, “Okay, cool.” And we have a very quick, flexible, and… We’re very nimble, I would say, at Razer, wherein we try to do as little as possible, but to scale as fast as possible just for our customer base.

This is gonna lead me to the big decision. You have announced you’re investing $600 million into AI over the next few years. You’re gonna hire 150 AI engineers, I think. The gamers hate it. The gamers, I think, are in open revolt against AI coming into their games, into their platforms. Certainly, developers are very worried about what’s gonna happen to software development. We’ve seen game studios rocked by AI.

That’s a pretty big disconnect. Even, I think, in the announcement of the CES tag line for Razer at CES, which is, “AI is the future of gaming.” I looked at the Instagram comments. If you’re listening to the gamers, you’d be like, “Well, we’re done with this.” How are you reconciling that gap?

So, I would say that the question is, “What are we unhappy with?” When I say we, I mean us as gamers. I think we’re unhappy with generative AI slop, right? Just to put it out there. And that’s something that I’m unhappy with. Like any gamer, when I play a game, I want to be engaged, I wanna be immersed, I wanna be able to be competitive. I don’t want to be served character models with extra fingers and stuff like that, or shoddily written storylines, so on and so forth. I think for us, we’re all aligned against gen AI slop that is just churned out from a couple of prompts and stuff like that.

What we aren’t against, at least, from my perspective, are tools that help augment or support, and help game developers make great games. And I think that’s fundamentally what we are talking about at Razer, right? So if we’ve got AI tools that can help game developers QA their games faster, better, and weed out the bugs, I think, along the way, we’re all aligned, and we would love that. If we could get game developers to have the opportunity to create better, to check through typos and things like that, to create better games, I think we all want that. So I think that’s the way that we see it.

One of the things that we’re building, for example, at Razer is what we call a QA companion. So QA tends to be an expensive endeavor. Like the gamer doesn’t see it at the end of the day, but it can take up like 30 to 40 percent of the cost, or delay games for the longest time. Now, what we’ve done is create a companion, a tool that works with the human QA tester to be able to automatically fill in forms, to say, “Okay, if this is…” Say the form is a Jira ticket, to say “this is a bug that is identified, there’s a graphical bug, there’s a performance bug.” All that’s logged very quickly, so it’s sent to the developer at the same time. The developer then can go in and say, “Okay, this is how I’ll fix the bug,” or, “These are suggestions on how I fix the bug.”

The way that we see it is that AI is a tool to help game developers make better games. In this case, rather than replacing human creativity — and that’s something I personally feel very passionately about — we want to figure out how we use AI in the gaming industry to get AI to do things better. In the broader scheme of things, I think that’s what we have been focused on. But there are other reasons why I think gamers are unhappy with AI, and I agree with them. I don’t like slop either, right? That’s one. Two, is it raising the cost of RAM? It is also raising the cost of RAM. I don’t like that at the same time.

Back in the day, there was the GPUs versus crypto situation and things like that, and this is the same thing. So I do think, however, that all gamers would love better games, more fun games, more engaging games, and if AI can help create that by doing better QA, I mean, I’m all for it.

I want to poke at that a little bit harder, but let me just ask you: is Razer feeling the RAM crunch and the GPU crunch like everybody else?

Oh, yes, absolutely. Because we make laptops and things like that.

I mean, we haven’t announced the prices for the next round of laptops, for example, and this is something that concerns me because the RAM prices are going up, and we want to be able to make sure our laptops remain affordable and within the reach of gamers out there. But it has been moving. It is such a volatile situation at this point in time that it’s hard for us to even figure out what the pricing is at this junction.

Do you think you’ll be able to pick a number and be confident in that number by the time the laptops have to come out?

I don’t know if I can pick a number right now as I speak with you, and by the end of the podcast.

You have competitors in the PC industry like Apple, Microsoft, and others. They can move their margins around. They have services, businesses, and stuff that attach to these laptops. Maybe they’ll take a hit on the RAM because you’re gonna have to pay for iCloud for the rest of your life, or whatever it is you’re gonna do. You don’t have that kind of secondary business. Is that more of a danger to you?

Well, we do have a secondary business of sorts. So hardware is a big part of our business. We actually have a services payments business where we do payments for a lot of the game companies out there, and that’s one of the strategies that we use to try to make our products more available to everyone. That’s the way that we kind of see it.

We are an ecosystem of sorts. We do great hardware, I think, for game developers and the gamers out there. But we’ve got a software platform that we are able to bring across to all the gamers out there. And of course, it’s a services business at the same time. But the RAM situation, at the end of the day, is still an evolving situation right now.

Do you think it will cap out, and do you think we’ll have enough data center capacity, and things will go back to normal?

Is there a point at which the price of RAM, or the price of a marginal Nvidia GPU, becomes too high for you to sustainably do laptops at your scale?

I would say I’m hoping that it doesn’t come to that, right? I think, in short, we’ve seen this happen with the industry multiple times in the past, spiked in terms of pricing. What’s great is that as long as manufacturing kicks in, and we are able to kind of keep up, it’s just economics at the end of the day. There is a spike in terms of pricing. We believe that at some point it will come down. What goes up must come down, and what goes down at some point goes up, too.

Let me come back to what you’re saying about AI and development. AI is the future of gaming. You’ve announced products here, and we’ve talked about Ava, the headset with the cameras and the AI stuff in it. That’s consumer AI products, right? Those are consumer products. And you’re saying your bet is on AI helping developers make better games faster. There’s a gap there, right?

AI is the future of gaming is an all-encompassing tag line. It means a lot of things to a lot of people, but it sounds like your bet is very specifically in sort of the more enterprise side of the house, helping developers do games better. Is it correct that it’s much narrower than what people are perceiving?

Well, I think the tag line’s very broad, but it’s easier to do a catchier tag line when it’s a broad tag line, as opposed to when it’s hardware we look at or software and stuff like that. But in short, for us, we run an ecosystem. We’ve got hardware, we’ve got software with services. Starting with the hardware, I think we do see that AI is going to be part of the whole kind of conversation. The way that we look at it would be things like whether it’s AI companions, or whether it’s making smart headphones, like with Motoko. We see all of this as augmenting what’s happening today, not replacing it.

So it’s not a gen AI conversation that we’ve got. It’s about how we bring the smarts, where we design products, and how we bring additional value to our users. For example, using our gaming headphones, all of a sudden, we can provide additional AI capabilities. Is that great? Absolutely. So, that’s one of the things that we’re looking at from a hardware perspective.

Now, from a software and services perspective, as we work with the game developers and publishers, and so on and so forth, we look at additional tools that can make their games better. We can work closely with them on a QA companion basis, for example. And then some of these core technologies, as we provide for them, can then make better games, over and above. So I believe that at some point, it’s not just games, but AI is just gonna be so prevalent or ubiquitous that every single vertical, healthcare, gaming, and entertainment, is gonna have some elements of AI there. And we are just going along with it.

I’ve heard this pitch a lot, and I have a lot of reactions to it. But I guess the simplest way of asking this question is, what have you seen that makes the bet worth it? Because I’ve evaluated a lot of these AI products, the merch team has reviewed a ton of them. We have literally just tried to do the things that Microsoft says you can do in the ads, and the products don’t work. Right? There’s this massive gap between what everyone says is gonna happen, or should be happening, and what is actually happening in the products.

You know, to be a cynic about it for the sake of getting a laugh out of this audience, I will tell you the products are best at convincing you that you should love them, and doing crimes, and they’re not so good at identifying what’s on your screen and helping you get a task done. They are really good at that in the domain of software development, right?

I can see why you’re pushing there with game developers. It’s obvious that Claude Code has ushered in some kind of revolution, and Cursor has ushered in some kind of revolution. In your vertical, you have something to offer that is different. But in the broad sense, this belief that it’s all just gonna happen, I think, has come up against the reality of what the products can do today. So what have you seen that suggests we will overcome that gap that makes you so confident?

Well, occasionally I go on podcasts where the guy is more concerned that someone’s gonna fall in love with my product in the long run. And I think maybe there’s something there. No, but you see, it’s early days. It could completely be the worst possible idea. It could completely go off the rails and become off the spectrum, where it’s just the most phenomenal product that somebody completely falls in love with, so on and so forth, right? And I think the reality is gonna be something in between. The way that we see it, it’s probably closer to bringing more value to people, and that’s what we want to be able to do.

We want to be able to get to the point where AI is going to be helpful to all customers, all users. And that’s also one good example where, at CES… I was just looking at some of the stats, and they said, “What’s the biggest buzz at CES?” And there were a lot, like Ava, Motoko, and things like that. And for what it’s worth, we’ve literally just put vision capabilities, audio capabilities on a headphone, and combined it with AI. It’s not a quantum leap from a hardware design perspective, but it has captured so much imagination at this point in time. People are going, “Oh, wow. Now I can bring AI on the go with me at any point in time.” It’s truly something revolutionary at this juncture. So the way that we see it, and maybe that’s something that–

Can we just hit pause on that? What specifically do you think is revolutionary about having the AI and the cameras in the headphones with you all the time?

Well, I would say that, first off, we are really looking at being able to have an unobtrusive universal form factor to enable AI smarts.

I think the whole industry is looking for this one factor, right? This is like when I hear about the platform shift, you suddenly had this massive input device paradigm shift, right? We’re going from touchscreens or mice to voice and vision. I get that. No one has sorted out that form factor, so your bet is headphones.

Our bet is on headphones in the sense that we don’t necessarily have to retrain human beings as a whole with an entirely new form factor. And so I don’t have to change any behavior of sorts. Boom, tomorrow we can get you AI smarts immediately. And that, I think, is the promise. There’s a disconnect today with the possibility of AI and what it could be, and that’s where we see ourselves as designers, having that responsibility, or the opportunity, so to speak, to be able to design in such a way that we don’t necessarily have to change the entire behavior.

For what it’s worth, in the very early days, it could be, for that matter, a mouse. It’s just a mouse. Why is a mouse so important that today we’ve brought it from a mouse all the way to a gaming mouse, and now the gaming mouse is a broader category than productivity, right? Gaming mice right now dominate the mouse category at this point in time. And right now, we can call it a smart headphone, and that’s the way we see it. We don’t necessarily have to retrain everybody to say, “Oh, you’ve gotta put on glasses. You’ve gotta be able to bear with the weight,” and things like that.

So that is one of the things that we’re doing with Motoko, and a lot of the work that we do is actually on the software side of things, right? How do we ensure that we get context faster? How do we ensure that we are able to do all of that? So it’s both hardware/software fusion and a sense of fusion at the same time, that we are really focused on in terms of bringing the experience over. That’s something that we believe is the reason why people go, “Oh, I absolutely get it, right now, why I would want something like that.”

So the model in the Motoko that I saw is ChatGPT.

Why’d you pick ChatGPT for the headphones and Grok for Ava?

So, ChatGPT for the headphones was primarily more from the premise that we think it’s a good assistant, in terms of CV capabilities, identifying things, and being able to give very quick feedback at the same time. But it could very well run Grok also at the same time. And the way that we are kind of presenting this is that whether it’s for Ava, or whether it’s for Motoko, or any of our other products, we are multi-model.

That was one of the things that we wanted to be able to do. We believe that at some point in time, you see Gemini doing really well. We see Grok doing really, really well. We see ChatGPT having advances in various aspects. This race to intelligence is just great for all of us as consumers, right? When I mention that Grok has great conversational AI, I think it is the best for conversational AI at this point in time. ChatGPT’s doing great, I think, in terms of it as an assistant, for reasoning and things like that. And that’s what we see ourselves. We see ourselves as owning the vertical from a gaming perspective, being able to work with all the best intelligence or the AI out there, and then bringing and designing a product or service tailored for our users, and within the gaming vertical.

So the vision is that I’m wearing headphones that have cameras, microphones, and speakers. I’m walking through the airport, and I’m just asking it, “Where is my gate?” and it’s telling me the answer from ChatGPT. Or is it more that I’m sitting at my desk playing a game and it’s helping me through the game?

All of the above. You can literally do that with Motoko at this point in time.

But this is what I mean about the capability gap. I think if I walk through the airport and I ask ChatGPT where my gate is, it would not get that right at this point in time. Like, there’s a model capability gap there.

I believe that if you use ChatGPT today and you’re providing snapshots with some context, like, let’s say, location, to a certain extent, you could. I would be messaging on my phone with ChatGPT, for example, and it could give me the reasoning to be able to bring me there, to a great extent. I’ll give an example, right? I would literally use ChatGPT for a whole bunch of day-to-day tasks and stuff like that. It’s got great reasoning; it’s able to do that. And now we are layering on vision capabilities, and that’s just another level of input.

Over and above, we’ve got far-field microphones. So audio capabilities also come to bear. With all of this, we’re able to give a lot more information across to ChatGPT, which does all the reasoning, I think, for us. And that’s where we see it coming through. So constantly, the smart or intelligence is part of how we see us designing AI hardware, at this point in time.

It seems like you have a pretty big reliance on the models themselves, right? You’re obviously not training your own models. You wanna be multi-model, you wanna let people choose. Are you thinking of yourself more as being the best at the hardware, the form factor, and having the best microphones and cameras, and that will let people use the models more conveniently?

Well, we are an ecosystem, but I think for gamers. It’s not just, I think, in terms of the hardware, but most of our work is actually done at the software side. If I use CES as an example, if I’ve got Ava, when I wake up, it’s giving me information like what’s happening in the day and what my day is gonna be today, so on and so forth. When I get out of my apartment, and I go out into the street, to the subway, et cetera, then I’ve got Motoko at the same time. But with persistent memory, it will know exactly what has been happening in the home. Ava is somewhat following me everywhere in my day. I’m not gonna fall in love with it yet.

But in short, it’s following my day, I’m going around, I’m looking at it, I’m asking for directions. When I get to the office, I could literally still be with Motoko, which is another form factor. So the way that we see it is that the intelligence is persistent, and it follows you. The form factors that are presented are hardware form factors. It’s a little bit like how we’ve designed our product at this point in time. We have a singular software platform where we are able to give you a great gaming experience, over and above. You could be using one of our mice, our keyboards, and so on and so forth, a laptop. These are just representations, at the end of the day. And that’s how we designed it, and there are particular problems that we need to solve that the models don’t provide for us. You know, context.

So that’s one of the things that our AI scientists do really well. We’ve got advanced retrieval augmented generation (RAG), we’ve got context, and we really focus on that. Persistent memory is something that we are very good at, at the same time. And these are fundamental problems that AI scientists need to solve. These are the things that our team does, so we work with the best models out there. And we also have the capabilities of creating physical representations, and that’s something that we’ve got a huge advantage at.

Doesn’t a lot of the value here just accrue back to these models? And yet, even if you’re building all this stuff above the models and around the models to make them work the way you want, it seems like, “Okay, my Ava is gonna be powered by ChatGPT no matter what.” If I want that unified experience, I’m just kind of, at the end of the day, talking to an instantiation of ChatGPT all day long, right?

Because then I have Grok over here and ChatGPT in the headphones, you can’t unify that. So at the end of the day, it’s all Gemini, or whatever model I choose. So, can you provide enough value to charge a premium on top of the ChatGPT subscription to make that work?

So that’s, I think, where our angle is, from the software perspective. We believe that we can bring enough value of persistence across to the user, and progressively we will see even more users who will say, “Look, this is what I want, to be able to go from one model to another,” for example. Or if I’m happy with just a single model, and if I’m a techie and I’m happy to just go directly and play around with it, we provide that open platform. So being open is one of the things that we truly believe in.

One of the things you notice when you cover AI enough is the idea that the AI startups are just wrappers on OpenAI, and then eventually OpenAI will just eat them as the models get more incapable. We’ve seen that play out already a little bit.

You obviously have hardware. Razer’s a different business, but you can see that dynamic here, where the core model capability might start to get the memory you’re talking about, where the core model capability might start to get the persistent personality across devices that you’re talking about. OpenAI is making hardware, we are told. There’s a competition with the core provider that is coming in different dimensions. How are you thinking about that?

Well, I think the entire tech industry has always been wrappers, for that matter, not necessarily from an AI perspective, but it’s the question of when you build a wrapper, do you provide enough value from the wrapper that you build? And that’s the thing, where it’s also very hard for anyone to be all things to all people. And I don’t think OpenAI wants to be all things to all people. I don’t think Grok wants to be all things to all people.

For us, we tend to be very focused on our vertical. We are not tempted to try to produce something else different at any point in time. And our vertical is really for the gamers. This is something we’ve got huge domain knowledge in terms of what the gamers want, what the game developers want. We’ve got distribution; we’ve got about 70,000 game developers using our SDK. We’ve got 150 million gamers on our software platform. We’ve got distribution, I think, across to that. Can the models go out there and try to build the distribution? Yes, but do they prefer to partner?

And I think the answer is they do prefer to partner. Fundamentally, we have a huge amount of data, I think, on the gamers, their preferences, what they want, what they like, and that we can bring that across to the models at the same time, which is our IP, for that matter. I think with that in mind, as I say, having all these verticals, you may call it building wrappers of sorts, but these are very deep wrappers that we have to build. A lot of customization, a lot of building, and it’s more than just hardware, right? It’s not hardware.

As I say, the hardware is just part of the equation. It’s the software part that we need to do. It’s the R and D work that we need to do, for example, to get persistence in this space and context. So to get the context for our users, that’s where our data comes in at the same time, to be able to kind of pivot and focus on that.

I think one of the reasons people like companies like Razer, and like dealing with products that Razer makes, is that you just buy them and you’re done. Like you can just buy the mouse, and then you own it, and it’s fine. You can just buy the laptop. I’m not in an ongoing subscription relationship with you, unless I want to be.

One of your competitors, Hanneke Faber from Logitech, came on the show a year or two ago, and she was like, “I wanna build a forever mouse,” and what she meant was a subscription mouse, and she’s never coming back on the show again, I think, based on the reaction to that. That’s my understanding of how they felt about that interview.

All the things you’re talking about are ongoing relationships, ongoing development costs. I hear it, and I hear the promise. I also hear, “I’m gonna have to pay a fee every month.” Like this is where that comes from. You need to pay the developers, you need to pay for cloud uptime to make the AI system alive. How much are you gonna charge for all of that?

Well, we’ve always had an ongoing relationship with our customer. That’s the thing, right? The way that we see it from Razer is that when somebody buys a Razer mouse, they tend to buy another Razer mouse in the future. They expand the devices that they own from us. So we’ve always had a long-term relationship with our customer, from that perspective. At some point in time, as we think through the whole AI uptime, so on and so forth… I mean, we’ve had cloud costs also in the past, maintaining profiles in clouds. For us, I think that’s one of the things that we want to figure out. What can we do to ensure that we bring value?

I think that’s our obsession. If there is no value, our customers won’t pay for it, we won’t pay for it ourselves, right? So to that end, that’s our focus, I think, in respect of it. And it could be through… We build into the hardware cost, for that matter, if that makes sense, and I’ll be candid: We have literally not thought through this in great detail. But the way that we see it is, how do we identify that value to the user? And from there we are very clear, we message this. This is the value that we see out of this, and we’ll let the market decide.

I look at that reaction from gamers, probably, to AI in the industry. There’s slop. I think there’s a lot of reaction to slop, and there’s a lot of reaction to game studios being in whatever amount of crisis the game studios appear to be in. There’s whatever reaction to consolidation. And then there’s the relentless fee seeking from the games industry, that everything is gonna be a subscription, everything is gonna be free to play with DLC, everything is gonna be an ongoing, recurring cost, over and over and over again.

The industry’s really moved to that model across the board, and I think people are feeling that pain. So then they hear AI, and they say, “Okay, someone else is gonna ask me for 10 bucks a month, or 20 bucks a month.” Can you avoid that? Can you just price it into the hardware? Is that going to be inevitable?

So, as I mentioned, I don’t know if we’re gonna price it into the hardware. We are still figuring it out. But I would say that, at the end of the day, the question is how much value are you getting on it, right? I mean, I pay for Spotify because I see the value in paying for Spotify. I get a whole library of music, and so on, and with Xbox Game Pass, so on and so forth.

There are times when I would prefer... I mean, I look back, and I go like, “Oh, I wish I could just pay one time for this title.” There are microtransactions, there are subscription fees. But at the end of the day, I think, myself as a consumer, myself as a gamer, I would say… I would just look at anything. I would say if it’s worth that amount of money to me, I would pay for it. Otherwise, I’ll vote with my wallet. That’s the way I see it.

Are you seeing signs that the AI stuff is gonna be worth paying for that way? I mean, this is the bubble. We’re gonna spend all this money, we’ll forward invest in all this infrastructure. We’re gonna skyrocket the price of RAM and GPUs, and then at the end of the day, people are going to say, “That’s not actually worth the 20 bucks a month.”

I don’t necessarily see it as AI, per se, but I see the kind of value that I get out of it. So, for example, a ChatGPT subscription, or a Grok subscription, for that matter. I do see value in it, and that’s why I pay for it. And that’s the way I see it. I don’t see myself as paying for AI, per se. I see it as what am I getting out of a chatbot, for example, that can advise me on travel matters, health matters, whatever it is, my day-to-day, and stuff like that. Is that worth 20 bucks to me?

I’m just saying, the marginal cost is meaningless to you.

20 bucks is still 20 bucks, that’s right.

I think for a lot of people, that is meaningful, especially stacked on top of all the other money they pay. Basically, I’m saying, do you see that critique of AI as a bubble? That the investment has not yet delivered the value that will make it so obvious that the investment’s worth it?

So I see that. I mean, huge amounts of investments are going into it. We are investing in AI, I think, as we speak. But I do see the potential at this point. In many cases, I mean, look at the number of paid subscribers for ChatGPT, for example. People do see the value in terms of whether it’s a chatbot AI, so on and so forth. I do think the potential is going to be realized.

Now, in many cases, I think there will be AI slop. I mean, I’ve paid for subscriptions that, at the start, I thought were gonna be great, but I’ve canceled them. But I do believe that in many cases, and in some cases that we have not even envisaged yet, the potential will be realized.

Let me ask you broadly, I mean, you obviously talk a lot to game developers. You and I actually were just talking backstage about the nature of art in the age of AI, and the nature of craft. That industry is going through an enormous amount of turmoil right now. What do you think the outcome looks like? What do you think makes that all feel good at the end?

I would say that the outcome that we see, and I think it’s gonna be the likely outcome, is that AI tools are gonna be helping human developers develop faster and better. And I think that’s the natural outcome, where we’re talking about graduating, whether it’s an analog kind of way of creating art versus digital. And I think it’s gonna be the same thing.

We’re going to see human artists use AI tools to kind of really bring their vision to life. We’ll see new forms of artists, artists of whom may not necessarily have been so adept in terms of using a paint brush or using Photoshop, now being able to kind of wordsmith and craft great pieces of art with prompts throughout. So that’s, I think, what’s going to happen, where we will see even more human creators, now with the help of more tools.

Maybe I’m an optimist, but I really, truly see that AI tools will come to fall, because at some point in time, we’re going to see so much slop out there that we’re going to crave for really great art, really great design. And that’s what’s gonna happen. We’ve seen a cycle go over and over and over again.

So, with the amount of slop out there, we’re going to see some level of art rise to the top, and that kind of art may still be created with the same tools that created the slop, but with great care, with great discernment, to be able to do something truly different. The difference will come from human ingenuity, not from countless prompt mashing, so to speak.

So I feel like I have to ask you this now. What games are you playing right now?

What meets the bar? I play a lot of single-player games at this point in time, like Civilization and stuff like that. I still do a lot of that. I do play some MMOs of sorts, shooters, and I still play a lot of the battle royale genre. So things like that.

You just named genres. What games are you playing that meet the bar?

You’re talking about human ingenuity and creativity. What games are you playing right now that meet the bar?

Oh, well, I play random stuff. If you’re talking about human ingenuity… I even play some of the Roblox games at this point in time, right? But a lot of the games, and maybe I talked broadly in terms of genres primarily because I appreciate the human ingenuity that’s gone into the genres themselves.

One hundred people dropped on an island with a circle that comes through. I mean, while I enjoy the game itself, I also appreciate the mechanics, the thought that has gone into them, and the premise that the designer has figured out. In PUBG, for example, it’s this primal instinct of humans to be the last man standing, so to speak. So it’s things like that that I appreciate, and I think it’s art.

Okay. What’s next for Razer? What should people be looking for?

More of the same, I would say, in the sense. When I say more of the same, I’d say nothing has changed from day one for us, and that has always been our mantra. And we used to say, all the time, that the mantra for us… Our “for gamers, by gamers” mantra has really followed us from day one, where the gaming industry didn’t really exist as an industry, even the hardware industry or software, and so on and so forth.

We believe that we’ve designed products for ourselves that we enjoy, that I enjoy using at any point in time, and that tomorrow, when the gaming industry grows dramatically, we will still be focused on games. Even though there are multiple opportunities for us to kind of expand out there. And even now, when we talk about the gaming industry in somewhat of a doldrums at this juncture, I believe that we’re gonna see the next great genre come through, right? Whether it’s MMOs in the early days, MOBAs, and then battle royales, we’re gonna see the next great genre. We’re hoping to see Grand Theft Auto VI at some point in time, right?

So all that, we look forward to, but we’re just pretty much laser-focused. It’s just that the demographic has really changed. The word gamer has also changed through the years. The games have changed through the years, right? For us, we’re just sitting here, very focused, and designing great products for ourselves.

Seletti, an Italian design brand known for everything from furniture to tableware, has debuted an unusual tribute to an icon of design: the Bic Cristal pen. To celebrate its 75th anniversary, Seletti has supersized the pen and replaced its ink cartridge with a long LED-filled tube to illuminate your living room, office, or that closet where they keep all the stationery at work.

The Bic Lamp, as it’s simply called, was introduced at the 2026 Maison&Objet show in Paris – think CES, but for interior designers. Seletti says it was created at a 12:1 scale, which makes it just shy of six feet long given the Bic Cristal pen typically measures around 5.8 inches with its cap. Aside from its larger dimensions and the LED tube producing up 2,400 lumens of light, the Bic Lamp is a near identical clone, in red, black, and blue color options.

You can hang it from a ceiling as a pendant lamp but Mario Paroli also designed the Bic Lamp to mount to a wall or stand alone as a floor lamp. It will launch in the US later this year where it’s expected to cost $350, according to Fast Company.

            <div id="article-text">This is today&#39;s edition of The Download, our weekday newsletter that provides a daily dose of what&#39;s going on in the world of technology.

Just before Christmas the Trump administration dramatically escalated its war on digital rights by banning five people from entering the US. One of them, Josephine Ballon, is a director of HateAid, a small German nonprofit founded to support the victims of online harassment and violence. The organization is a strong advocate of EU tech regulations, and so finds itself attacked in campaigns from right-wing politicians and provocateurs who claim that it engages in censorship.

EU officials, freedom of speech experts, and the five people targeted all flatly reject these accusations. Ballon told us that their work is fundamentally about making people feel safer online. But their experiences over the past few weeks show just how politicized and besieged their work in online safety has become. Read the full story.

Chatbots are skilled at crafting sophisticated dialogue and mimicking empathetic behavior. They never get tired of chatting. It’s no wonder, then, that so many people now use them for companionship—forging friendships or even romantic relationships. 72% of US teenagers have used AI for companionship, according to a study from the nonprofit Common Sense Media. But while chatbots can provide much-needed emotional support and guidance for some people, they can exacerbate underlying problems in others—especially vulnerable people or those with mental health issues.

Although some early attempts to regulate this space are underway, AI companionship is going nowhere.

It’s a “complex and subtle emotion that elicits feelings of comfort, serenity, and a gentle sense of floating.” It’s peaceful, but more ephemeral and intangible than contentment. It might be evoked by the sight of a sunset or a moody, low-key album.

If you haven’t ever felt this sensation—or even heard of it—that’s not surprising. A Reddit user generated it with ChatGPT, along with advice on how to evoke the feeling. Don’t scoff: Researchers say more and more terms for these “neo-­emotions” are showing up online, describing new dimensions and aspects of feeling. Read our story to learn more about why.

Gavesh’s journey started, seemingly innocently, with a job ad on Facebook promising work he desperately needed.

Instead, he found himself trafficked into a business commonly known as “pig butchering”—a form of fraud in which scammers form close relationships with targets online and extract money from them. The Chinese crime syndicates behind the scams have netted billions of dollars, and they have used violence and coercion to force their workers, many of them trafficked like Gavesh, to carry out the frauds from large compounds, several of which operate openly in the quasi-lawless borderlands of Myanmar.

Big Tech may hold the key to breaking up the scam syndicates—if these companies can be persuaded or compelled to act. Read the full story.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Today marks an inflection point for enterprise AI adoption. Despite billions invested in generative AI, only 5% of integrated pilots deliver measurable business value and nearly one in two companies abandons AI initiatives before reaching production.

The bottleneck is not the models themselves. What’s holding enterprises back is the surrounding infrastructure: Limited data accessibility, rigid integration, and fragile deployment pathways prevent AI initiatives from scaling beyond early LLM and RAG experiments. In response, enterprises are moving toward composable and sovereign AI architectures that lower costs, preserve data ownership, and adapt to the rapid, unpredictable evolution of AI—a shift IDC expects 75% of global businesses to make by 2027.

AI pilots almost always work, and that’s the problem. Proofs of concept (PoCs) are meant to validate feasibility, surface use cases, and build confidence for larger investments. But they thrive in conditions that rarely resemble the realities of production.

“PoCs live inside a safe bubble” observes Cristopher Kuehl, chief data officer at Continent 8 Technologies. Data is carefully curated, integrations are few, and the work is often handled by the most senior and motivated teams.

The result, according to Gerry Murray, research director at IDC, is not so much pilot failure as structural mis-design: Many AI initiatives are effectively “set up for failure from the start.”

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">It was early evening in Berlin, just a day before Christmas Eve, when Josephine Ballon got an unexpected email from US Customs and Border Protection. The status of her ability to travel to the United States had changed—she’d no longer be able to enter the country.

At first, she couldn’t find any information online as to why, though she had her suspicions. She was one of the directors of HateAid, a small German nonprofit founded to support the victims of online harassment and violence. As the organization has become a strong advocate of EU tech regulations, it has increasingly found itself attacked in campaigns from right-wing politicians and provocateurs who claim that it engages in censorship.

It was only later that she saw what US Secretary of State Marco Rubio had posted on X:

For far too long, ideologues in Europe have led organized efforts to coerce American platforms to punish American viewpoints they oppose. The Trump Administration will no longer tolerate these egregious acts of extraterritorial censorship.Today, @StateDept will take steps toâ€¦

Rubio was promoting a conspiracy theory about what he has called the “censorship-industrial complex,” which alleges widespread collusion between the US government, tech companies, and civil society organizations to silence conservative voices—the very conspiracy theory HateAid has recently been caught up in.

Then Undersecretary of State Sarah B. Rogers posted on X the names of the people targeted by travel bans. The list included Ballon, as well as her HateAid co-director, Anna Lena von Hodenberg. Also named were three others doing similar or related work: former EU commissioner Thierry Breton, who had helped author Europe’s Digital Services Act (DSA); Imran Ahmed of the Center for Countering Digital Hate, which documents hate speech on social media platforms; and Clare Melford of the Global Disinformation Index, which provides risk ratings warning advertisers about placing ads on websites promoting hate speech and disinformation.

It was an escalation in the Trump administration’s war on digital rights—fought in the name of free speech. But EU officials, freedom of speech experts, and the five people targeted all flatly reject the accusations of censorship. Ballon, von Hodenberg, and some of their clients tell me that their work is fundamentally about making people feel safer online. And their experiences over the past few weeks show just how politicized and besieged their work in online safety has become. They almost certainly won’t be the last people targeted in this way.

Ballon was the one to tell von Hodenberg that both their names were on the list. “We kind of felt a chill in our bones,” von Hodenberg told me when I caught up with the pair in early January.

But she added that they also quickly realized, “Okay, it’s the old playbook to silence us.” So they got to work—starting with challenging the narrative the US government was pushing about them.

Within a few hours, Ballon and von Hodenberg had issued a strongly worded statement refuting the allegations: “We will not be intimidated by a government that uses accusations of censorship to silence those who stand up for human rights and freedom of expression,” they wrote. “We demand a clear signal from the German government and the European Commission that this is unacceptable. Otherwise, no civil society organisation, no politician, no researcher, and certainly no individual will dare to denounce abuses by US tech companies in the future.”

Those signals came swiftly. On X, Johann Wadephul, the German foreign minister, called the entry bans “not acceptable,” adding that “the DSA was democratically adopted by the EU, for the EU—it does not have extraterritorial effect.” Also on X, French president Emmanuel Macron wrote that “these measures amount to intimidation and coercion aimed at undermining European digital sovereignty.” The European Commission issued a statement that it “strongly condemns” the Trump administration’s actions and reaffirmed its “sovereign right to regulate economic activity in line with our democratic values.”

Ahmed, Melford, Breton, and their respective organizations also made their own statements denouncing the entry bans. Ahmed, the only one of the five based in the United States, also successfully filed suit to preempt any attempts to detain him, which the State Department had indicated it would consider doing.

But alongside the statements of solidarity, Ballon and von Hodenberg said, they also received more practical advice: Assume the travel ban was just the start and that more consequences could be coming. Service providers might preemptively revoke access to their online accounts; banks might restrict their access to money or the global payment system; they might see malicious attempts to get hold of their personal data or that of their clients. Perhaps, allies told them, they should even consider moving their money into friends’ accounts or keeping cash on hand so that they could pay their team’s salaries—and buy their families’ groceries.

These warnings felt particularly urgent given that just days before, the Trump administration had sanctioned two International Criminal Court judges for “illegitimate targeting of Israel.” As a result, they had lost access to many American tech platforms, including Microsoft, Amazon, and Gmail.

“If Microsoft does that to someone who is a lot more important than we are,” Ballon told me, “they will not even blink to shut down the email accounts from some random human rights organization in Germany.”

“We have now this dark cloud over us that any minute, something can happen,” von Hodenberg added. “We’re running against time to take the appropriate measures.”

Founded in 2018 to support people experiencing digital violence, HateAid has since evolved to defend digital rights more broadly. It provides ways for people to report illegal online content and offers victims advice, digital security, emotional support, and help with evidence preservation. It also educates German police, prosecutors, and politicians about how to handle online hate crimes.

Once the group is contacted for help, and if its lawyers determine that the type of harassment has likely violated the law, the organization connects victims with legal counsel who can help them file civil and criminal lawsuits against perpetrators, and if necessary, helps finance the cases. (HateAid itself does not file cases against individuals.) Ballon and von Hodenberg estimate that HateAid has worked with around 7,500 victims and helped them file 700 criminal cases and 300 civil cases, mostly against individual offenders.

For 23-year-old German law student and outspoken political activist Theresia Crone, HateAid’s support has meant that she has been able to regain some sense of agency in her life, both on and offline. She had reached out after she discovered entire online forums dedicated to making deepfakes of her. Without HateAid, she told me, “I would have had to either put my faith into the police and the public prosecutor to prosecute this properly, or I would have had to foot the bill of an attorney myself”—a huge financial burden for “a student with basically no fixed income.”

In addition, working alone would have been retraumatizing: “I would have had to document everything by myself,” she said—meaning “I would have had to see all of these pictures again and again.”

“The internet is a lawless place,” Ballon told me when we first spoke, back in mid-December, a few weeks before the travel ban was announced. In a conference room at the HateAid office in Berlin, she said there are many cases that “cannot even be prosecuted, because no perpetrator is identified.” That’s why the nonprofit also advocates for better laws and regulations governing technology companies in Germany and across the European Union.

On occasion, they have also engaged in strategic litigation against the platforms themselves. In 2023, for example, HateAid and the European Union of Jewish Students sued X for failing to enforce its terms of service against posts that were antisemitic or that denied the Holocaust, which is illegal in Germany.

This almost certainly put the organization in the crosshairs of X owner Elon Musk; it also made HateAid a frequent target of Germany’s far right party, the Alternative für Deutschland, which Musk has called “the only hope for Germany.” (X did not respond to a request to comment on this lawsuit.)

For better and worse, HateAid’s profile grew further when it took on another critical job in online safety. In June 2024, it was named as a trusted flagger organization under the Digital Services Act, a 2022 EU law that requires social media companies to remove certain content (including hate speech and violence) that violates national laws, and to provide more transparency to the public, in part by allowing more appeals on platforms’ moderation decisions.

Trusted flaggers are entities designated by individual EU countries to point out illegal content, and they are a key part of DSA enforcement. While anyone can report such content, trusted flaggers’ reports are prioritized and legally require a response from the platforms.

The Trump administration has loudly argued that the trusted flagger program and the DSA more broadly are examples of censorship that disproportionately affect voices on the right and American technology companies, like X.

When we first spoke in December, Ballon said these claims of censorship simply don’t hold water: “We don’t delete content, and we also don’t, like, flag content publicly for everyone to see and to shame people. The only thing that we do: We use the same notification channels that everyone can use, and the only thing that is in the Digital Services Act is that platforms should prioritize our reporting.” Then it is on the platforms to decide what to do.

Nevertheless, the idea that HateAid and like-minded organizations are censoring the right has become a powerful conspiracy theory with real-world consequences. (Last year, MIT Technology Review covered the closure of a small State Department office following allegations that it had conducted “censorship,” as well as an unusual attempt by State leadership to access internal records related to supposed censorship—including information about two of the people who have now been banned, Medford and Ahmed, and both of their organizations.)

HateAid saw a fresh wave of harassment starting last February, when 60 Minutes aired a documentary on hate speech laws in Germany; it featured a quote from Ballon that “free speech needs boundaries,” which, she added, “are part of our constitution.” The interview happened to air just days before Vice President JD Vance attended the Munich Security Conference; there he warned that “across Europe, free speech … is in retreat.” This, Ballon told me, led to heightened hostility toward her and her organization.

Fast-forward to July, when a report by Republicans in the US House of Representatives claimed that the DSA “compels censorship and infringes on American free speech.” HateAid was explicitly named in the report.

All of this has made its work “more dangerous,” Ballon told me in December. Before the 60 Minutes interview, “maybe one and a half years ago, as an organization, there were attacks against us, but mostly against our clients, because they were the activists, the journalists, the politicians at the forefront. But now … we see them becoming more personal.”

As a result, over the last year, HateAid has taken more steps to protect its reputation and get ahead of the damaging narratives. Ballon has reported the hate speech targeted at her—“More [complaints] than in all the years I did this job before,” she said—as well as defamation lawsuits on behalf of HateAid.

All these tensions finally came to a head in December. At the start of the month, the European Commission fined X $140 million for DSA violations. This set off yet another round of recriminations about supposed censorship of the right, with Trump calling the fine “a nasty one” and warning: “Europe has to be very careful.”

Just a few weeks later, the day before Christmas Eve, retaliation against individuals finally arrived.

Digital rights groups are pushing back against the Trump administration’s narrow view of what constitutes free speech and censorship.

“What we see from this administration is a conception of freedom of expression that is not a human-rights-based conception where this is an inalienable, indelible right that’s held by every person,” says David Greene, the civil liberties director of the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a US-based digital rights group. Rather, he sees an “expectation that… [if] anybody else&#39;s speech is challenged, there&#39;s a good reason for it, but it should never happen to them.”

Since Trump won his second term, social media platforms have walked back their commitments to trust and safety. Meta, for example, ended fact-checking on Facebook and adopted much of the administration’s censorship language, with CEO Mark Zuckerberg telling the podcaster Joe Rogan that it would “work with President Trump to push back on governments around the world” if they are seen as “going after American companies and pushing to censor more.”

And as the recent fines on X show, Musk’s platform has gone even further in flouting European law—and, ultimately, ignoring the user rights that the DSA was written to protect. In perhaps one of the most egregious examples yet, in recent weeks X allowed people to use Grok, its AI generator, to create nonconsensual nude images of women and children, with few limits—and, so far at least, few consequences. (Last week, X released a statement that it would start limiting users&#39; ability to create explicit images with Grok; in response to a number of questions, X representative Rosemarie Esposito pointed me to that statement.)

For Ballon, it makes perfect sense: “You can better make money if you don’t have to implement safety measures and don’t have to invest money in making your platform the safest place,” she told me.

“It goes both ways,” von Hodenberg added. “It’s not only the platforms who profit from the US administration undermining European laws … but also, obviously, the US administration also has a huge interest in not regulating the platforms … because who is amplified right now? It’s the extreme right.”

She believes this explains why HateAid—and Ahmed’s Center for Countering Digital Hate and Melford’s Global Disinformation Index, as well as Breton and the DSA—have been targeted: They are working to disrupt this “unholy deal where the platforms profit economically and the US administration is profiting in dividing the European Union,” she said.

The travel restrictions intentionally send a strong message to all groups that work to hold tech companies accountable. “It’s purely vindictive,” Greene says. “It’s designed to punish people from pursuing further work on disinformation or anti-hate work.” (The State Department did not respond to a request for comment.)

And ultimately, this has a broad effect on who feels safe enough to participate online.

Ballon pointed to research that shows the “silencing effect” of harassment and hate speech, not only for “those who have been attacked,” but also for those who witness such attacks. This is particularly true for women, who tend to face more online hate that is also more sexualized and violent. It’ll only be worse if groups like HateAid get deplatformed or lose funding.

Von Hodenberg put it more bluntly: “They reclaim freedom of speech for themselves when they want to say whatever they want, but they silence and censor the ones that criticize them.”

Still, the HateAid directors insist they’re not backing down. They say they’re taking “all advice” they have received seriously, especially with regard to “becoming more independent from service providers,” Ballon told me.

“Part of the reason that they don’t like us is because we are strengthening our clients and empowering them,” said von Hodenberg. “We are making sure that they are not succeeding, and not withdrawing from the public debate.”

“So when they think they can silence us by attacking us? That is just a very wrong perception.”

Depending who you ask, AI-powered coding is either giving software developers an unprecedented productivity boost or churning out masses of poorly designed code that saps their attention and sets software projects up for serious long term-maintenance problems.

The problem is right now, it’s not easy to know which is true.

As tech giants pour billions into large language models (LLMs), coding has been touted as the technology’s killer app. Executives enamored with the potential are pushing engineers to lean into an AI-powered future. But after speaking to more than 30 developers, technology executives, analysts, and researchers, MIT Technology Review found that the picture is not as straightforward as it might seem. Read the full story.

Technically speaking, neuroscientists have been able to read your mind for decades. It’s not easy, mind you. First, you must lie motionless within a fMRI scanner, perhaps for hours, while you watch films or listen to audiobooks.

If you do elect to endure claustrophobic hours in the scanner, the software will learn to generate a bespoke reconstruction of what you were seeing or listening to, just by analyzing how blood moves through your brain.

More recently, researchers have deployed generative AI tools, like Stable Diffusion and GPT, to create far more realistic, if not entirely accurate, reconstructions of films and podcasts based on neural activity. So how close are we to genuine “mind reading?” Read the full story.

            <div id="article-text">Earlier this week, MIT Technology Review published its annual list of Ten Breakthrough Technologies. As always, it features technologies that made the news last year, and which—for better or worse—stand to make waves in the coming years. They’re the technologies you should really be paying attention to.

This year’s list includes tech that’s set to transform the energy industry, artificial intelligence, space travel—and of course biotech and health. Our breakthrough biotechnologies for 2026 involve editing a baby’s genes and, separately, resurrecting genes from ancient species. We also included a controversial technology that offers parents the chance to screen their embryos for characteristics like height and intelligence. Here’s the story behind our biotech choices.

In August 2024, KJ Muldoon was born with a rare genetic disorder that allowed toxic ammonia to build up in his blood. The disease can be fatal, and KJ was at risk of developing neurological disorders. At the time, his best bet for survival involved waiting for a liver transplant.

Then he was offered an experimental gene therapy—a personalized “base editing” treatment designed to correct the specific genetic “misspellings” responsible for his disease. It seems to have worked! Three doses later, KJ is doing well. He took his first steps in December, shortly before spending his first Christmas at home.

KJ’s story is hugely encouraging. The team behind his treatment is planning a clinical trial for infants with similar disorders caused by different genetic mutations. The team members hope to win regulatory approval on the back of a small trial—a move that could make the expensive treatment (KJ’s cost around $1 million) more accessible, potentially within a few years.

Others are getting in on the action, too. Fyodor Urnov, a gene-editing scientist at the University of California, Berkeley, assisted the team that developed KJ’s treatment. He recently cofounded Aurora Therapeutics, a startup that hopes to develop gene-editing drugs for another disorder called phenylketonuria (PKU). The goal is to obtain regulatory approval for a single drug that can then be adjusted or personalized for individuals without having to go through more clinical trials.

US regulators seem to be amenable to the idea and have described a potential approval pathway for such “bespoke, personalized therapies.” Watch this space.

It was a big year for Colossal Biosciences, the biotech company hoping to “de-extinct” animals like the woolly mammoth and the dodo. In March, the company created what it called “woolly mice”—rodents with furry coats and curly whiskers akin to those of woolly mammoths.

The company made an even more dramatic claim the following month, when it announced it had created three dire wolves. These striking snow-white animals were created by making 20 genetic changes to the DNA of gray wolves based on genetic research on ancient dire wolf bones, the company said at the time.

Whether these animals can really be called dire wolves is debatable, to say the least. But the technology behind their creation is undeniably fascinating. We’re talking about the extraction and analysis of ancient DNA, which can then be introduced into cells from other, modern-day species.

Analysis of ancient DNA can reveal all sorts of fascinating insights into human ancestors and other animals. And cloning, another genetic tool used here, has applications not only in attempts to re-create dead pets but also in wildlife conservation efforts. Read more here.

IVF involves creating embryos in a lab and, typically, “scoring” them on their likelihood of successful growth before they are transferred to a person’s uterus. So far, so uncontroversial.

Recently, embryo scoring has evolved. Labs can pinch off a couple of cells from an embryo, look at its DNA, and screen for some genetic diseases. That list of diseases is increasing. And now some companies are taking things even further, offering prospective parents the opportunity to select embryos for features like height, eye color, and even IQ.

This is controversial for lots of reasons. For a start, there are many, many factors that contribute to complex traits like IQ (a score that doesn’t capture all aspects of intelligence at any rate). We don’t have a perfect understanding of those factors, or how selecting for one trait might influence another.

Some critics warn of eugenics. And others note that whichever embryo you end up choosing, you can’t control exactly how your baby will turn out (and why should you?!). Still, that hasn’t stopped Nucleus, one of the companies offering these services, from inviting potential customers to have their “best baby.” Read more here.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Venture capital powerhouse Sequoia Capital is preparing to invest in Anthropic, the AI startup best known for its Claude family of large language models, in one of the largest private funding rounds in tech this year. The deal is being led by Singapore’s GIC and U.S. investor Coatue, each contributing roughly $1.5 billion, as part of a planned raise of $25 billion or more at a staggering $350 billion valuation.

This move stands out for two reasons: the size and speed of the valuation surge and the fact that Sequoia, already an investor in rival AI builders such as OpenAI and Elon Musk’s xAI, is broadening its exposure across competing AI platforms.

Traditionally, top-tier VC firms have avoided backing direct competitors simultaneously. The logic was simple: protect information flows and avoid internal conflicts of interest. Sequoia’s willingness to back Anthropic despite existing stakes in other AI outfits signals a shift in how investors view the AI market. It reflects a belief that the sector is large enough to support multiple winners rather than requiring firms to choose a single champion.

Anthropic itself has grown quickly since its founding by former OpenAI researchers. Industry reporting shows the company has attracted significant talent from established AI labs and introduced advanced models and enterprise features, contributing to its rapid valuation climb over the past year.

A $350 billion valuation, even before a public listing, is eye-watering. It resets expectations for what private AI companies can command and puts pressure on competitors to secure equally large capital backing or risk falling behind. Analysts suggest that few AI firms may go public at these valuations, pointing instead to continued private rounds or alternative exit strategies if market sentiment shifts.

That dynamic is a symptom of a broader trend: a global AI capital rush that has persisted even amid concerns about a bust cycle or a funding slowdown in other tech segments. Investors remain convinced that AI will reshape industries from software to logistics, health care, and beyond, and are willing to deploy extraordinary sums to secure influence in that future.

For European markets and founders, the Sequoia-Anthropic deal carries both opportunities and warnings. Europe has strong academic AI talent, an active startup ecosystem, and deep expertise in areas like robotics, industrial automation, and data privacy.

Yet venture capital density still trails the U.S., and marquee AI funding rounds of this scale are rare on the continent.
This investment could accelerate European interest in AI startups, drawing more attention and potentially more capital into the region.

It reinforces the idea that global capital flows are not limited by geography and that talent mobility, not territory, increasingly defines the AI race. European AI talent has been moving among global hubs, and deals like this underline how strongly competitive pressures are shaping that movement.

At the same time, the concentration of huge capital in a few dominant players raises strategic questions for European policymakers and investors. If global valuations continue to centralise power and resources in U.S. and Asia-based AI giants, Europe’s AI initiatives may struggle to build regional champions with equivalent scale.

Efforts to foster AI ecosystems, from regulatory clarity to public funding mechanisms, will be tested in the face of such capital dynamics.

Sequoia’s bet on Anthropic, despite its exposure to rivals, underscores a fundamental truth about where the AI race is headed: talent and execution matter more than regional advantage.

For European startups, this means honing in on distinctive technical niches, enterprise traction, and real-world impact rather than simply following headline valuations.

The Anthropic round may be a moment of spectacle, but its lasting impact will be measured in how ecosystems evolve, how talent flows, and how global competition shapes opportunities for innovation across borders. European players can benefit from these trends, but only if they leverage their own strengths in research, ethics-led deployment, and deep industry partnerships.

In the end, this deal isn’t just about money; it’s a signal of where confidence lies in the next chapter of AI, and who stands to gain as a result.

            <h2>Europe’s €307 million AI funding call</h2>
            <p><strong>The Next Web | 2026-01-19</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://thenextweb.com/news/europes-e307-million-ai-funding-call">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">When the European Commission announced on 15th of January a €307.3 million funding call for AI and related tech under Horizon Europe earlier this year, the press materials presented it as a strategic push toward trustworthy AI and European digital autonomy. The funding targets trustworthy AI, data services, robotics, quantum, photonics, and what Brussels calls “open strategic autonomy.”

Viewed in isolation, the number itself isn’t eye-popping. By global standards, where the private sector alone pours hundreds of billions into AI, €307 million is barely a rounding error. Yet this sum matters less for its scale and more for what it reveals about Europe’s longstanding dilemma: how to balance ambitious tech leadership with a cautious, value-driven regulatory culture.

What the EU has done here is consistent with a long-running pattern. Brussels has been building an AI ecosystem that explicitly prioritises ethics, safety , and strategic autonomy over raw capability. The “Apply AI Strategy,” which this funding supports, is designed to ensure AI systems are trustworthy and aligned with European values.

This contrasts sharply with the Silicon Valley model, where scale, speed , and commercial dominance often trump wider social aims.
There’s value in that distinction. Too much focus on growth alone can produce outcomes that benefit a few platforms while leaving society to manage the fallout from algorithmic bias , misinformation , and opaque decision-making systems.

Europe’s regulatory framework, including the Artificial Intelligence Act, embeds risk-based guardrails that aim to prevent harm without halting innovation entirely.

But here’s the rub: principle without productivity can feel like good intentions in a vacuum.

Three years into the AI revolution, the EU’s cumulative investments from this €307 million pool to broader programs under Horizon Europe reflect ambition on paper. But across hard metrics like proprietary model development, commercial AI exports, and infrastructure scale, Europe still lags the US and China. In 2025, reports noted Europe produced far fewer notable AI models than its global competitors, a symptom of a deeper ecosystem gap.

Investing in trustworthy AI is laudable; it’s also inherently longer-term, often without the immediate returns that lure commercial capital. By contrast, the US innovation model embraces iterative risk and market experimentation, which helps explain its dominance in foundational model research and deployment.

Here, Europe’s regulatory heft of the AI Act and related oversight mechanisms both help and hinder. Responsible frameworks can build trust and alignment with public values, but if they become too cumbersome, they risk slowing the very innovation they are meant to guide. Bosch’s leadership in Europe has cautioned against “regulating itself to death,” arguing that excessive bureaucracy deters research and deployment.

The €307 million funding explicitly aims to strengthen strategic autonomy and the ability of European innovators to develop AI technologies without dependency on external tech giants.

That’s a worthy goal. Yet autonomy is easier to declare than to realise. Achieving it requires not just funding research but building scale, infrastructure, talent, and market pull simultaneously. Europe’s efforts on AI gigafactories and high-performance computing centres signal long-term intent, but critics still see fragmentation in infrastructure and business support.
In other words, strategic autonomy without substantial ecosystem maturity can feel like sovereignty in theory, not practice.

The question isn’t whether Europe should fund AI research. The question is whether Europe can translate normative leadership into technological leadership.

If the goal is to lead in ethical, human-centric AI that serves public interest first, then this funding fits a broader philosophy. If the goal is to rival the scale and velocity of global tech powers, then incremental investments like this, however well-intentioned, are positions in a longer, incomplete race.

The EU’s approach to AI will succeed only if it pairs principled regulation with bold bets on infrastructure, startups and commercial pathways that scale quickly. That won’t happen through selective research grants alone.

Europe can still carve a distinctive niche in global AI. Its regulatory clarity, public-interest focus and collaborative innovation structures give it moral authority and, over time, competitive strength if it can channel them into meaningful technological outcomes.

For now, the €307 million is a marker on a long road, not a finish line. It signals where Brussels stands: committed to values, cautious by design, and eager to shape the trajectory of AI, even if it’s not yet setting the pace.

            <div id="article-text">OpenAI’s decision to introduce advertisements inside ChatGPT for free users and its new $8 “Go” tier is already shaping up to be one of the most consequential pivots in generative AI’s short history. It’s not a simple business tweak. It’s a reframing of where digital intent, attention, and commercial influence intersect in an age where conversations increasingly replace search bars.

Yet, this moment will be remembered not as the day ads arrived in ChatGPT, but as the day two decades of assumptions about search and digital advertising broke open.

Read that again: ads won’t sit beside or above a list of links, as they do on Google. They will appear inside the conversational flow, at the moment a user has just received a helpful answer.

This is not incremental. It’s a new interface for intent.

The latest rumblings from the EU tech scene, a story from our wise ol&#39; founder Boris, and some questionable AI art. It&#39;s free, every week, in your inbox. Sign up now!

For years, OpenAI developed ChatGPT as an ad-free oasis in a web saturated with promotions, pop-ups, and sponsored results. Now it’s embracing the oldest monetization strategy on the internet: advertising.  The company insists ads will be clearly labeled, won’t influence AI responses, and won’t depend on selling individual user data. Ads will appear below answers when relevant, and paid tiers like Plus, Pro, Business, and Enterprise remain ad-free.

To understand why this matters, you need to see it not as an ad insertion, but as a shift in how commerce enters human intent, at the moment of decision, not distraction.

In a classic Google search, thoughtful queries turn into ranked links and ad slots beside them. In a ChatGPT conversation, a user asks a question, gets an answer, and stays in context; the frame never changes. An ad beneath that response isn’t an interruption; it’s an extension of the thought process. This subtle repositioning changes how brands can engage a user: they’re not chasing clicks after a search, they’re walking up with the answer itself.

That’s a paradigm shift. Brands are no longer competing for top billing on a results page; they are competing to be part of the narrative that unfolds between a question and a resolution. It’s a level of semantic proximity to intent that search ads never capture, because even the best keywords are guesses at nuance. ChatGPT sees nuance first.

Let restaurants, retailers, and SaaS companies imagine that: not just showing an ad after someone searches “best CRM tools,” but appearing contextually right when someone asks “what CRM features matter to small teams.” That changes where conversion flows start.

This isn’t happening. OpenAI’s infrastructure costs are enormous, and its free user base dwarfs its subscriber base. Only a small fraction of ChatGPT’s hundreds of millions of weekly active users currently pay. Advertising offers a scalable revenue path that could subsidize free access and help the company balance long-term costs.

It’s striking that OpenAI once positioned ads as a “last resort.” Now they’re a strategic mainstay. That tells you two things: the scale of AI compute bills is real, and the company is trying to find a sustainable business model that doesn’t rely solely on subscription fatigue.

ChatGPT’s value isn’t just utility; it’s credibility, the feeling that the answer isn’t trying to sell you something. Introducing ads atop or below answers may be technically neutral, but perception is sticky. Once a user notices “Sponsored” within the thoughtful flow of a conversation, trust becomes negotiable. Academic research on ads in AI interfaces shows that even labeled ads can reduce perceived trust and make users feel manipulated, especially if they blur with responses.

OpenAI recognizes this. It’s promising to avoid showing ads in sensitive contexts, like health, politics, or personal advice, and won’t target minors. It’s also pledging that ads won’t twist the model’s answers.

Yet trust isn’t a function of code; it’s a feeling users develop over time. One poorly placed ad recommendation, even if accurate, can make people wonder whether the answer was shaped by commercial rather than objective logic.

From a creative standpoint, this is both exciting and fraught. The ads we’ve long tolerated have trained us to think of marketing as interruption: banners, pop-ups, pre-roll videos. ChatGPT’s approach suggests something closer to contextual dialogue, where an ad feels like a part of exploration. The brands that succeed here won’t be the loudest; they’ll be the most relevant, most resonant, and most human. They’ll read like answers, not impositions, because they’re embedded in answers.

That opens a new creative demand: marketers will need to think less about clickbait hooks and more about narrative relevance, how to be helpful within a user’s question, not beside it.

Is this the end of Google? No. Google’s advertising machine is vast, integrated, and highly optimized. Its AI integration in search, including AI summaries, already blends insight with ads in ways that are more sophisticated than many realize.

But the rise of ads in ChatGPT signals that intent has multiple layers now. There’s traditional search intent tied to links and pages, and there’s conversational intent captured in natural language interactions. These layers will coexist, sometimes reinforce, sometimes compete.

Advertisers and creators today often optimize for keywords. Tomorrow, they’ll optimize for conversational moments, the semantic cues that signal purchase interest within a dialogue.

The rollout now is just the beginning. If AI systems evolve into multi-modal, interactive assistants that help people plan trips, make purchases, write essays, plan budgets, and solve problems of every sort, the point at which commerce enters that interaction becomes crucial.

The question is no longer “Will people see our ad?” but “Will they trust our recommendation when it pops up next to an AI answer?”

That’s the real test, and the real frontier.

            <a class="original-link" href="https://thenextweb.com/news/bizzynow-opens-mamacrowd-equity-round">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Italian startup BizzyNow has launched an equity crowdfunding round on Mamacrowd to finance the next phase of its networking app, built around quick, in-person meetups it calls “Bizzy Moments.” The campaign targets €150k–€400k at a €3m pre-money valuation, with a €500 minimum ticket. BizzyNow says proceeds will support go-to-market validation, product upgrades, and the operational groundwork needed to scale.

Professional networking has a timing problem. The most valuable introductions often happen in the gaps: 40 minutes before a flight, a pause between conference sessions, an unscheduled evening in a new city, or the lull after a client meeting. But the tools professionals typically use to connect are optimized for asynchronous, low-context interactions (requests, messages, posts) rather than real-time, location-based intent.

BizzyNow’s premise is simple: when two relevant people are already in the same place, and both have time, “discovering each other” should not require long threads, calendar gymnastics, or cold outreach. The company positions its product as a way to turn downtime during business travel and events into structured, high-signal conversations.

“BizzyNow is built for the moments when professionals are already in the same place, with time to meet, but no practical way to discover each other quickly. We’re giving people a way to use that moment to show their best side, and turn idle business travel time into measurable B2B outcomes”, said the CEO, Tommaso Fe.

BizzyNow is designed to turn “I have 45 minutes” into a practical meeting. The app uses geolocation plus an AI layer and LinkedIn integration to surface nearby professionals who may be relevant, then encourages short, structured meetups lasting roughly 30 to 90 minutes. BizzyNow describes these as micro-meetings held in neutral, community-recommended locations, intended to move beyond chatting into a realconversation. BizzyNow also describes a trust-oriented scoring approach that is meant to reflect the value creates through meetings, emphasizing quality and follow-through rather than connection
volume.

BizzyNow is pitching into a familiar contradiction: professionals are back at conferences, airports, hotels, and coworking spaces, but introductions still default to slow, noisy digital channels. In-person events have regained their role as dealflow engines. Yet discovery remains fragmented across LinkedIn messages, WhatsApp groups, and chance encounters, with little infrastructure for “right person, right place, right time.” BizzyNow is betting that instant, location-aware matching can become a practical layer for high-intent environments, especially where timing is the constraint.

The company’s target segments reflect that focus. In campaign materials, BizzyNow points to business travelers, managers, freelancers, expats, event communities, corporate HR, coworking spaces, hotels, and airports as core audiences and partners.

The raise is being run via Mamacrowd, one of Italy’s established equity crowdfunding platforms, and the campaign is live.

On the Mamacrowd listing, the round is set with:

For early-stage startups, equity crowdfunding can be more than financing. It can act as a public proof point for market interest, build a base of aligned advocates, and strengthen credibility with commercial partners, especially for products that grow through communities.

BizzyNow’s internal materials describe traction that is still early but measurable, including ca. 2,000 free users, 400 weekly active users (22.6% WAU-to-total), and six active corporate pilots. The same documents state that the company is in pre-revenue, with monetization intentionally deferred during the validation phase. That context matters: this is a campaign funding a transition from adoption validation to monetization proof, not a late-stage expansion round.

“Crowdfunding fits our model because community is not a byproduct for us. It’s part of how we validate activation, refine the product, and build repeatable go-to-market channels before scaling”, said the CEO, Tommaso Fe.

BizzyNow’s pitch deck frames its roadmap as a progression “from validation to global market,” staged across three years:

● 2025: MVP, beta launch, early validation
● 2026: Premium launch, B2B pilots, monetization validation
● 2027: EMEA expansion and scale readiness

That sequencing aligns with what BizzyNow describes in its internal underwriting materials: corporate pilots are active, monetization is modeled to begin mid-2026, and the near-term priority is proving repeatable activation and conversion mechanics.

On use of funds, the Executive Pitch Deck states the round is intended to validate monetization, strengthen product capabilities, and prepare for scale, with spend tied to measurable validation milestones across:

● Marketing & GTM validation
● Product and premium features
● Compliance and governance
● Team and operations

The Mamacrowd campaign further breaks planned allocation into ranges:

● 40%–50% Marketing and Brand Activation
● 20%–25% Technology Development (BizzyNow app)
● 10% Legal and Compliance
● 10%–15% Team and Operations● 10% Strategic reserve

BizzyNow also outlines a B2B-oriented monetization path in its deck and model assumptions, including paid event activations, company-wide licensing, and data/analytics packages, while explicitly noting that projections remain validation-stage assumptions and will be refined as unit economics are proven.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">In January 2026, London’s mayor gave a blunt warning that has reverberated far beyond City Hall: artificial intelligence could trigger “mass unemployment” in the capital’s core industries unless policymakers act now.

His words came with an unexpected counterweight: an announcement of free AI training and a dedicated task force to help workers adapt. This juxtaposition captures a tension shaping Europe’s labour landscape: fear and opportunity locked in the same story.

The anxiety isn’t limited to one city. Across the continent, debates about AI’s impact on jobs are intensifying. Visionaries and critics paint dramatically different pictures. Some technologists warn that advanced AI could substitute human labour at an unprecedented pace.

“AI will replace humans”, you heard this before.

Others argue these fears are exaggerated or misplaced if governments and employers can guide the transition. For many Europeans, the question is no longer theoretical; it is unfolding before their eyes.

At first look, the job market’s headline figures tell a reassuring story: overall unemployment across the European Union remains low, with EU unemployment at about 5.8% in 2025, down from 6.0% a year earlier. Youth unemployment has also declined in many countries, indicating that even entry-level opportunities persist for most workers.

In some sectors where AI tools are already in use, work has been reshaped rather than eliminated. A European study found that 30% of EU workers now use AI at work, especially for text tasks like writing and translation, and that digital tools have become nearly universal (90%) across workplaces.

Many workers report that AI helps them perform tasks more efficiently or take on different responsibilities. At the same time, employers are actively reassessing job roles because of AI, with about 71% of European firms reconsidering job responsibilities due to AI implementation and over a quarter reducing hiring or cutting roles as a direct result of AI deployment.

Beneath these numbers lie subtler shifts. Firms across the EU are becoming cautious about hiring, in part because of economic slowdowns and in part because AI adoption is changing how work gets done. Economic indicators suggest employment growth across the EU will slow in the coming years, with fewer vacancies and reduced labour market dynamism even as AI use spreads.

The most visible tension is at the intersection of perception and preparation. On the one hand, public statements like London’s mayors reflect a palpable fear of displacement. Sectors such as finance, legal services, and customer support, pillars of many European economies,  are widely considered vulnerable to automation and generative AI technologies.

Detailed labour data suggest that many jobs are being reshaped at the task level, even if entire job categories are not yet disappearing wholesale. For example, AI is automating routine text production and data tasks while increasingly augmenting analytical and oversight functions.

On the other hand, there are signs of adaptability. Governments and institutions are launching initiatives to reskill workers and embed AI fluency into professional development. Across Europe, digital skills gaps remain significant; only 56% of adults aged 16-74 had basic digital skills in 2023, well below the EU’s target, indicating the scale of upskilling needed.

Educational efforts range from vocational programs to industry partnerships that teach AI-related skills. For example, private training providers across the EU are expanding online programs in data science, analytics, and AI competencies, reflecting a growing recognition that skills matter as much as technology itself.

It would be a mistake to frame this moment as simply a binary between jobs lost and jobs saved. The World Economic Forum’s Future of Jobs Report 2025 predicts both creation and disruption, with employers foreseeing demand for entirely new roles even as others change or shrink.

The report finds that technologies, including AI, are expected to create millions of new jobs globally while displacing an estimated number of others, highlighting the scale of transformation.

There is also a policy dimension that can’t be overlooked. European institutions are experimenting with social safety nets and active labour market policies that aim to cushion displacement and support transitions.

Proposals like a European AI Social Compact argue for strategies that combine employment support, training, and social protections as central to economic planning.

National governments are debating everything from expanded unemployment support tied to training to tax incentives for companies that invest in human capital alongside AI. These measures acknowledge that the future of work is not simply about machines replacing people, but about how people and machines can be integrated into resilient labour ecosystems.

Yet challenges remain. Entry-level opportunities, the traditional gateway for recent graduates, are tightening in many sectors as employers increasingly use automated systems in recruitment and candidate screening.

Surveys suggest broad concern among young job seekers about prospects in an AI-transformed market, even where overall employment remains stable.

Some employers are re-imagining entry paths by embedding AI training into internship programs, while others are partnering with universities to co-design curricula that emphasize AI-augmented work. These efforts signal that adaptation is possible, but they also highlight how uneven the transition has been so far.

What Europe faces now is not a single story of mass job losses or unrestrained job growth. It is a mosaic of experiences, where headlines of risk and reports of adaptation coexist. The labour market is not static; it is reacting to technology, to policy, to fear and hope in equal measure.

If there is a throughline, it’s this: Europe’s future of work will be shaped not just by the capabilities of artificial intelligence, but by choices about education, regulation, and social support.

The decisions policymakers and employers make today will tilt the balance between disruption and opportunity. In that sense, the conversation is less about whether AI will change jobs; it already is, and more about how Europe navigates the change.

That is the reality workers, firms, and governments must confront together.

This reminds me of the well-known anecdote in Romanian political history in which Ion I.C. (Ionel) Brătianu, asked by historian and politician Nicolae Iorga what a scholar could learn from an engineer, replied with just that phrase, a call for moderation and thoughtful judgment: “Measure, sir, measure!”

Thus, measure, thoughtful regulation, and worker-focused policy will make sure AI supports people’s work, protects rights, and steers technological change toward shared opportunity, not making them unemployed.
