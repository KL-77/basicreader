            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/12/heres-why-nasa-and-the-space-force-are-interested-in-pizza-shaped-satellites/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Four small satellites rode a Rocket Lab Electron launch vehicle into orbit from Virginia early Thursday, beginning a government-funded technology demonstration mission to test the performance of a new spacecraft design.

The satellites were nestled inside a cylindrical dispenser on top of the 59-foot-tall (18-meter) Electron rocket when it lifted off from NASA’s Wallops Flight Facility at 12:03 am EST (05:03 UTC). A little more than an hour later, the rocket’s upper stage released the satellites one at a time at an altitude of about 340 miles (550 kilometers).

The launch was the starting gun for a “proof of concept” mission to test the viability of a new kind of satellite called DiskSats. These satellites were designed by the Aerospace Corporation, a nonprofit federally funded research and development center. The project is jointly financed by NASA and the US Space Force, which paid for DiskSat’s development and launch, respectively.

“DiskSat is a lightweight, compact, flat disc-shaped satellite designed for optimizing future rideshare launches,” the Aerospace Corporation says in a statement.

The DiskSats are 39 inches (1 meter) wide, about twice the diameter of a New York-style pizza, and measure just 1 inch (2.5 centimeters) thick. Made of composite carbon fiber, each satellite carries solar cells, control avionics, reaction wheels, and an electric thruster to change and maintain altitude.

“The launch went perfectly, and the DiskSat dispenser worked exactly as designed,” said Darren Rowen, the project’s chief engineer, in a statement. “We’re pleased to have established contact with all four of the DiskSats, and we’re looking forward to the rest of the demonstration mission.”

The Aerospace Corporation has a long history of supporting of the US military and NASA since its founding in 1960. A few years ago, engineers at the center came up with the DiskSat concept after surveying the government’s emerging needs in spaceflight.

CubeSats have been a ubiquitous part of the satellite industry for nearly a quarter-century. They are based on a cube-shaped design, measuring about 10 centimeters per side, but can be scaled from a single cube “unit” to three, six, 12, or more, depending on mission requirements. The CubeSat standard has become a popular choice for commercial companies, the military, NASA, and universities looking to build small satellites on a tight budget.

By one measure, nearly 3,000 CubeSats have launched since the first one soared into orbit in 2003. After originally being confined to low-Earth orbit, they have now flown to high-altitude orbits, to the Moon, and to Mars.

While CubeSats are now prolific, engineers at the Aerospace Corporation saw an opportunity to improve on the concept. Debra Emmons, Aerospace’s chief technology officer, said the idea originated from Rich Welle, a scientist recently retired from the center’s Experiments Lab, or xLab, division.

“They were asking questions,” Emmons recounted in an interview with Ars. “They were looking at CubeSat studies and looking at some alternatives. The typical CubeSat is, in fact, a cube. So, the idea was could you look at some different types of form factors that might be able to generate more power … and offer up benefit for certain mission applications?”

Aerospace’s research team arrived at the DiskSat design. Emmons said the stackable flat-panel format is easier to pack for launch than a CubeSat. The concept is similar to SpaceX’s pioneering approach to launching stackable Starlink Internet satellites, but DiskSats are significantly smaller, lighter, and adaptable to different kinds of missions.

DiskSats have several advantages over CubeSats, according to the Aerospace Corporation. Each of the four DiskSats launched Thursday has a mass of about 35 pounds (16 kilograms), less than that of a typical 12U CubeSat. But a DiskSat has more than 13 times the surface area on a single side, providing valuable real estate for developers to load up the satellite with power-generating solar arrays, sensors, antennas, or other payloads that simply won’t fit on a CubeSat.

SpaceX’s current generation of mass-produced Starlink V2 satellites, by comparison, each have a mass of more than 1,100 pounds, or 500 kilograms.

DiskSat’s design offers “a power-to-weight ratio unmatched by traditional aluminum satellites,” the Aerospace Corporation says. In a research paper published earlier this year, engineers from the Aerospace Corporation claimed DiskSat can generate five to 10 times more power than a CubeSat.

What kinds of missions might DiskSat be useful for? One idea involves placing a large radar antenna—too big to fit on any other low-mass satellite—on the broadside of a DiskSat to collect all-weather surveillance imagery. Similarly-sized antennas on other DiskSats could support high-bandwidth communications.

With this demo mission, the Aerospace Corporation will test the performance of the DiskSat platform in space for the first time. Engineers will initially look at how the satellites function at 340 miles, then use their electric thrusters to gradually step down to lower altitudes, where another aspect of DiskSat’s design will shine.

Flying edge-on, the satellite’s pancake shape will minimize aerodynamic drag as the DiskSats encounter thicker air below 250 miles. Continual pulsing from the satellites’ electric thrusters will allow the DiskSats to maintain altitude as they glide through the uppermost layers of the atmosphere.

“The primary mission is to demonstrate and to understand the performance, functionality and maneuverability of the DiskSat buses on orbit, particularly in low-Earth orbit, or LEO, and very low-Earth orbit, or VLEO,” said Catherine Venturini, DiskSat’s principal investigator.

“In theory, I think you could operate down to 200 kilometers (124 miles) with electric propulsion,” Emmons said. That is two to three times closer to Earth than most commercial radar imaging satellites. Other satellite operators are also assessing the viability of flying remote sensing missions in VLEO.

Flying closer to the ground delivers higher-resolution imagery, bringing cities, ships, airports, and military bases into sharper view. So it’s easy to see why the Space Force is interested in the DiskSat concept.

DiskSat’s engineers acknowledge there are drawbacks to the format. With such a large surface area, it’s more difficult to manage the temperature extremes of low-Earth orbit than it is with a conventional cube-shaped satellite. While DiskSats carry a lot of oomph to change altitude, their shape makes them somewhat clunky and hard to turn, and engineers say they aren’t well suited for missions requiring agile pointing.

The Aerospace Corporation is a research center, not a commercial satellite manufacturer. Officials at the nonprofit are looking to hand over the DiskSat design to industry through a technology transfer agreement. “The plan is to release or license the technology to partners once it is flight-proven,” the Aerospace Corporation says on its website.

“We think this new technology will be disruptive to the small spacecraft enterprise and ecosystem,” said Eric Breckheimer, DiskSat’s program manager.

DiskSat’s stackable design makes it possible to launch a fleet of high-power, low-mass satellites in one go, according to Emmons.

Following the trend toward bigger CubeSats, the DiskSat format could also grow larger to take advantage of heavier rockets. “There’s a key scalability aspect, and with that in mind, you could bring an entire constellation of DiskSats with you in a single launch,” Breckheimer said.</div>

            <h2>Parasites plagued Roman soldiers at Hadrian’s Wall</h2>
            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2025-12-19</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/12/study-roman-soldiers-battled-parasites-at-hadrians-wall/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">It probably sucked to be a Roman soldier guarding Hadrian’s Wall circa the third century CE. W.H. Auden imagined the likely harsh conditions in his poem “Roman Wall Blues,” in which a soldier laments enduring wet wind and rain with “lice in my tunic and a cold in my nose.” We can now add chronic nausea and bouts of diarrhea to his list of likely woes, thanks to parasitic infections, according to a new paper published in the journal Parasitology.

As previously reported, archaeologists can learn a great deal by studying the remains of intestinal parasites in ancient feces. For instance, in 2022, we reported on an analysis of soil samples collected from a stone toilet found within the ruins of a swanky 7th-century BCE villa just outside Jerusalem. That analysis revealed the presence of parasitic eggs from four different species: whipworm, beef/pork tapeworm, roundworm, and pinworm. (It’s the earliest record of roundworm and pinworm in ancient Israel.)

Later that same year, researchers from the University of Cambridge and the University of British Columbia analyzed the residue on an ancient Roman ceramic pot excavated at the site of a 5th-century CE Roman villa at Gerace, a rural district in Sicily. They identified the eggs of intestinal parasitic worms commonly found in feces—strong evidence that the 1,500-year-old pot in question was most likely used as a chamber pot.

Other prior studies have compared fecal parasites found in hunter-gatherer and farming communities, revealing dramatic dietary changes, as well as shifts in settlement patterns and social organization coinciding with the rise of agriculture. This latest paper analyzes sediment collected from sewer drains at the Roman fort at Vindolanda, located just south of the defense fortification known as Hadrian’s Wall.

An antiquarian named William Camden recorded the existence of the ruins in a 1586 treatise. Over the next 200 years, many people visited the site, discovering a military bathhouse in 1702 and an altar in 1715.  Another altar found in 1914 confirmed that the fort had been called Vindolanda. Serious archaeological excavation at the site began in the 1930s. The site is most famous for the so-called Vindolanda tablets, among the oldest surviving handwritten documents in the UK—and for the 2023 discovery of what appeared to be an ancient Roman dildo, although others argued the phallus-shaped artifact was more likely to be a drop spindle used for spinning yarn.

Per the authors of this latest paper, analyzing fecal matter (paleoparasitology) from Roman Britain  has thus far largely been done at urban centers such as London and York, and the only site where it has been done along Hadrian’s Wall is Carlisle. Vindolanda’s exceptional preservation makes it a prime candidate for learning more about the transmission of parasites and resulting gastrointestinal diseases among the Roman military manning the northern frontiers at that time.

The material was collected in 2019 from the main drain carrying latrine waste from the bath house toilet down to the stream and valley to the north. The team also excavated what was left of a 17th-century farmhouse, where they found sealed deposits from a previous third-century bath house drain at the site. They collected and analyzed 58 samples of sediment from those drains, as well as one sample collected from a nearby fort ditch circa 90 CE.

The analysis revealed that 28 percent of the samples contained eggs from either roundworms or whipworms, intestinal parasites typically spread as a result of poor sanitation, either via food, drink, or hands that come in contact with fecal matter. The first-century fort sample also contained roundworms and whipworms. Using a biomolecular method that binds antibodies to proteins produced by single-cell organisms, they found traces of a microscopic protozoan parasite called Giardia duodenalis. According to the authors, this suggests Roman solders regularly suffered from diarrhea and malnutrition.

Even having communal latrines and a sewer system apparently didn’t prevent parasitic transmission. “While the Romans were aware of intestinal worms, there was little their doctors could do to clear infection by these parasites or help those experiencing diarrhoea, meaning symptoms could persist and worsen,” said co-author Marissa Ledger of the University of Cambridge. “These chronic infections likely weakened soldiers, reducing fitness for duty. Helminths alone can cause nausea, cramping and diarrhea.”

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">A couple of hours after a judge formally swore in private astronaut Jared Isaacman as the next administrator of NASA on Thursday, President Donald Trump signed an executive order outlining his space policy objectives for the next three years.

The executive order, titled “Ensuring American Space Superiority,” states that the country must “pursue a space policy that will extend the reach of human discovery, secure the nation’s vital economic and security interests, unleash commercial development, and lay the foundation for a new space age.”

There is nothing Earth-shattering in the new executive order, as much of it builds on previously announced policies that span multiple administrations. There are some notable points in the document that clearly reflect the White House’s priorities, though, and Isaacman’s leadership of NASA.

Strikingly, there is no mention of a concrete plan to send humans to Mars in this document. There are just two references to the red planet, both of which talk about sending humans there as a far-off goal. One source recently told Ars that as soon as Trump learned there was no way humans could land on Mars during his second term, he was no longer interested in that initiative.

Also absent from this document is much reference to space science, with only a mention of “optimizing space research-and-development investments to achieve my Administration’s near-term space objectives.”

The architect of the Trump Administration’s proposed deep cuts in space science (which Congress has largely forestalled) was Russ Vought, head of the Office of Management and Budget. It’s probably not a great indicator for science missions that Isaacman is directed to coordinate with Vought’s office to achieve policy objectives in the executive order.

All told, the policies Trump signed are generally forward-looking, seeking to modernize NASA’s exploration efforts. Isaacman will face many challenges, including landing humans on the Moon by 2028 and working with industry to develop an on-time successor to the International Space Station. Whether and how he meets these challenges will be an intriguing storyline in the coming months and years.</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Sure, an inexplicable small-town mystery is fun.

But for John Grossnickle, sheriff of Sweetwater County, Wyoming, this one’s getting a little stale. For over a year, Sweetwater officials have been trying to get to the bottom of a series of unexplained appearances by unidentified flying objects.

Alarmingly, the UFOs seem to have a peculiar interest in a local power facility, the Jim Bridger Steam Plant, which houses four coal-fired generators.

“We’ve worked with everybody,” the sheriff’s spokesperson, Jason Mower told the Cowboy State Daily. “We’ve done everything we can to figure out what they are, and nobody wants to give us any answers.”

Sheriff Grossnickle, who began fielding calls about the sightings 13 months ago, says he’s now observed them with his own eyes. The objects are said to be “lighted” and “drone-like,” and congregate together in “coordinated formations,” CSD reports. They’re typically reported between 2am or 3am.

Shooting them down isn’t an option, as they fly thousands of feet above ground. A state investigation doesn’t seem to be on the table either, as Wyoming National Guard adjutant general Greg Porter said he “doesn’t think he could discuss [them] in open testimony,” per CSD.

“It’s like the new normal,” Mower explained. “It’s like this phenomenon that continues to happen, but it’s not causing any, you know, issues that we have to deal with — other than the presence of them.”

Officials in Sweetwater aren’t alone. Seven sheriffs of nearby counties canvassed by CSD said they’d either viewed similar mystery objects or received reports about them from locals. Back in January, three of those sheriffs had documented sightings above energy infrastructure such as oil fields and power plants, CSD reported at the time.

The strange Wyoming sightings come nearly a year after similar drone hysteria in New Jersey was seemingly put to rest. Despite a huge mystery back in late 2024, president Donald Trump claimed tho drones were authorized by the Federal Aviation Administration for research.

Whether the same can be said for the Wyoming UFO mystery? That’s anyone’s guess.

            <div id="article-text">What’re professional team sports without a good shoving match? Basketball star Kyrie Irving got into one recently — though not on the court, but with a humanoid robot.

In a video shared by the Dallas Mavericks social media page, a Unitree G1 android shows off its slick karate moves in front of the team, before Irving approaches and squares it up. The diminutive 4’2″ robot displays better survival instincts than most humans and nervously skitters away from the imposing athlete, who is two feet taller.

But it was to no avail. Irving shoves it in the chest, and the robot stumbles with human-like agility — or lack thereof — before falling flat on its back. Onlookers howl in laughter as it lies paralyzed on the ground, utterly motionless.

“My apologies, I thought I could push him a little harder,” Irving says, while the robot’s operators attend to it like courtside medics. “My bad.”

Maybe next time he can shoot hoops with one instead.

Back falls are no joke. Irving and the others try to lift the bot back on its feet, but it remains unresponsive, its limbs flopping around. Later, Irving comes back to check on it one last time, but it’s still out cold.

The Unitree G1 has become a cultural sensation with its surprising spryness and cute stature, with influencers using them for all kinds of slapstick stunts and “GONE WRONG!” videos. Some have become their own mini-celebrities, like “Jake the Rizzbot,” which is known for slinging Gen-Z slang and coming out as gay, whatever that means for a robot.

One way Unitree bots often shows off their adroitness is by performing martial arts moves, a trend that other robotics companies have eagerly jumped on (with some interesting iterations.) The flipside is that they also make tempting punching-bags for humans. No doubt that it’s hilarious to see them ragdoll on the ground after getting laid out, but they can only take so much abuse. The owners of Jake the Rizzbot, for instance, are currently suing the popular streamer IShowSpeed for allegedly wrecking their little celebrity after he punched it in the face, pinned it to a couch, and threw it to the ground during a stream.

As it stands, it’s unclear what condition the Mavericks robot is in after Irving made it eat pavement. But we hope it’s okay — if not for its sake, then for our own.

“Skynet will remember that,” a commenter joked.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">On December 11, OpenAI release ChatGPT 5.2, the latest version of the widely used AI chatbot.

As it does every time it releases a minor update, the company hailed its latest version as a “significant improvement in general intelligence,” calling it the “best model yet for real-world, professional use.” In a further display of hubris, OpenAI even went so far as to claim 5.2 is their “first model that performs at or above a human expert level.”

Yet when we ran it through an incredibly simple prompt — to generate an alphabetized chart of animals for school children — the world-beating AI model came up laughably short.

The ABC deficiency was first noticed by BCA Research chief global strategist Peter Berezin. Using ChatGPT 5.1, which was released back in November, Berezin asked the AI to “draw [a] poster where you say A is for an animal that starts with the letter A, B for an animal that starts with B, all the way to Z.”

That version thought for six seconds, and spat out an image with 25 letters, as opposed to the standard English alphabet which uses 26. Already off to a rocky start, 5.1 does an okay job with “A” through “I,” but falls off the rails as soon as it gets to “K,” which it says “is for Lion.”

It goes on like this: “O is for jellyfish,” while “Q is for penguin” and “R is for snake.” By the time it gets to the end, “Z” is for “urba” — a turtle, apparently — followed by “B,” along with a picture of a pig.

“Still needs more capex,” Berezin quips, referencing the $1.15 trillion OpenAI has committed to spending on hardware in 2025 alone.

We were curious how ChatGPT 5.2 stacked up to its month-old predecessor — and sure enough, it didn’t disappoint.

Though the latest version of ChatGPT did a bit better with individual animals, it still only identified 24 letters in the English alphabet, forgetting “U” and “Z.” Instead, 5.2 listed “Y” for “Yak” right after “T.” This particular alphabet ends with “X,” which of course stands for “X-ray fish,” but is illustrated by a Zebra.

Its illustrations were also a bit suspect, with Kangaroos sporting a weird limb, an Iguana with two tails, a Narwal with a strange mash of eyes and fins as well as a bird’s beak, and a hedgehog with a cat’s face, to name a few weak points.

A follow-up prompt only spread the spill around. This time, there are 25 letters total. “Y” is still a problem area, taking the place of “U,” only this time it stands for “Unicorn,” which isn’t a real animal in the first place. By the end, there are two entries for “X,” one of which “is for fish,” followed by another “X,” again for “X-ray fish,” but with the same Zebra illustration.

The second poster also starts to scramble the instructions, injecting bits of the prompt into the poster title: “A is for alligator, B is for bear…”

As some users on X-formerly-Twitter pointed out, results are the same for Google’s Gemini, and as a quick glance at Grok shows, Elon Musk’s AI engine isn’t even close. But while ChatGPT might be the best at making an animal poster, it still comes up laughably short — and certainly not at the level of any “human expert” we’ve ever met.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Every year, TechCrunch looks back at the cybersecurity horrorshows of the past 12 months — from the biggest data breaches to hacks resulting in weeks of disruption — to see what we can learn. This year, the data breaches were like nothing we’ve seen before.

Here’s our look back at some of the biggest security incidents of 2025, starting with:

The U.S. government remained one of the biggest targets in cyberspace. The year started with a brazen cyberattack by Chinese hackers on the U.S. Treasury, followed by the breaching of several federal agencies, including the agency tasked with safeguarding U.S. nuclear weapons, thanks to a SharePoint security flaw.

All the while, the Russian hackers were stealing sealed records from the U.S. Courts’ filing system, sending alarm bells ringing across the federal judiciary.

But nothing quite came as close as DOGE ripping through federal government departments and databases in what became the biggest raid of U.S. government data in its history.

The Trump administration’s Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE as it was widely known, led by Elon Musk and his band of private sector lackeys, violated federal protocols and defied common security practices. They ransacked federal databases of citizens’ data, despite warnings of the national security risks and conflicts of interests over Musk’s overseas business dealings. Legal experts say that DOGE staffers are “personally liable” under U.S. hacking laws, though a court would also have to agree.

Musk’s subsequent, very public falling out with President Trump saw the billionaire leave DOGE, and left staffers fearing that they could face federal charges without his protection.

In late September, senior executives at American corporate giants began receiving threatening emails from a prolific ransomware and extortion group called Clop. The emails included an attached copy of their personal information — and a ransom demand for several million dollars not to publish it.

Months earlier, the Clop gang had quietly exploited a never-before-seen vulnerability in Oracle’s E-Business software, a suite of applications used for hosting a company’s core business information, such as financial and human resources records, supply chain data, and customer databases. The vulnerability allowed Clop to steal reams of sensitive employee data, including data belonging to executives, from dozens of organizations that rely on Oracle’s software.

Oracle had no idea until it was caught out in October as it was scrambling to patch the vulnerability. It was too late, though: the hackers had already stolen gobs of data from universities, hospitals and health systems, media organizations, and more.

This was Clop’s most recent mass-hacking campaign. The group had previously exploited flaws in enterprise file-transfer services, such as GoAnywhere, MOVEit, and Cleo Software, which tech giants use to share large amounts of information over the internet.

Salesforce customers had a rough year after two separate data breaches at downstream tech companies allowed hackers to steal a billion records of customer data stored in Salesforce’s cloud.

Hackers targeted at least two companies, Salesloft and Gainsight, both of which allow their customers to handle and analyze the data that they store in Salesforce.

By breaching these companies directly, the hackers gained access to all of the data through their customer connections to Salesforce. Some of the largest tech giants had data stolen in the breaches, including Bugcrowd, Cloudflare, Google, Proofpoint, Docusign, GitLab, Linkedin, SonicWall and Verizon.

A hacking collective known as Scattered Lapsus$ Hunters, made up of members from different hacking groups, including ShinyHunters, published a data leak site advertising the stolen records in exchange for a ransom paid by the victims. New victims are still rolling in.

Hackers tore through the U.K. retail sector earlier this year, stealing data from Marks & Spencer and at least 6.5 million customer records from the Co-op. The back-to-back hacks sparked outages and disruption across the retailers’ networks, and some grocery shelves went empty as the systems used to support the retailers were knocked out. Luxury store Harrods was also later hacked.

But a major cyberattack targeting Jaguar Land Rover, one of the country’s biggest employers, left a dent in the U.K. economy. A September hack and data breach saw JLR’s car plant stall production for months as the company worked to get its systems back up and running.

The fallout affected JLR’s suppliers across the U.K., some of whom went out of business altogether. The U.K. government ended up guaranteeing a bailout to the tune of £1.5 billion to ensure Jaguar Land Rover employees and suppliers got paid during the shutdown.

U.K. security experts said the breach was the most economically damaging cyberattack to hit the United Kingdom in history, showing that disruption may be more valuable for financially motivated hackers than stolen data.

South Korea experienced a major data breach every month this year, and the personal data of millions of its citizens was compromised thanks to security lapses and shoddy data practices at the country’s biggest tech and phone providers.

The country’s largest phone company, SK Telecom, was hacked and 23 million customer records were exposed; several cyberattacks were attributed to its hostile North Korean neighbor; and a massive data center fire wiped out years of Korean government data that wasn’t backed up.

But the cherry on data breach cake was the months-long theft of some 33 million customers’ personal information from Coupang, the country’s retail giant that some call Asia’s Amazon. The data theft began in June, but wasn’t detected until November, and ultimately led to the company’s chief executive resigning.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">OpenAI is in talks to raise up to $100 billion in a funding round that could value the ChatGPT maker at up to $830 billion, the Wall Street Journal reported Thursday, citing anonymous sources.

The company is aiming to raise the funding by the end of the calendar first quarter next year, and it may ask sovereign wealth funds to invest in the round, the WSJ reported. The Information first reported news of the deal, though it said the fundraise would land OpenAI a $750 billion price tag.

The funding would come as OpenAI commits to spend trillions of dollars and strikes deals around the world as the company tries to stay ahead in the race to develop AI technology. The cash injection would also help the company with its spending on inferencing, which seems to be funded more by cash than cloud credits, suggesting the company’s compute costs have grown beyond what partnerships and credits can subsidize.

And, as competition intensifies from rivals like Anthropic and Google, OpenAI has had to step on the gas to release new models and expand its presence in the developer and tooling ecosystem.

Meanwhile, broader sentiment around AI has recently cooled as investors start doubting whether the pace of debt-fueled investment by giants like Amazon, Microsoft, Oracle, and OpenAI itself can be maintained in the long run. It also doesn’t help that the production of chips is being constrained by shortages in the supply of memory chips, which threatens to affect the broader tech sector.

OpenAI has also been rumored to be working on an IPO as a way to raise tens of billions and fund its development efforts, which are currently said to be generating annual run-rate revenue of about $20 billion. There are also rumors that the company is courting Amazon for a $10 billion investment that would also give the AI lab access to the tech giant’s new AI computing chips.

If the fundraise happens, it would add a substantial amount to OpenAI’s coffers, which currently have more than $64 billion, according to PitchBook data. The company was most recently valued at about $500 billion in a secondary transaction.

OpenAI did not immediately return a request for comment.

            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/18/tiktok-agrees-to-deal-to-cede-control-of-u-s-business-to-american-investor-group/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">TikTok has reached a deal to cede a substantial portion of its U.S. operation to a group of American investors, thus ending a years-long tussle in which the federal government has sought to force the platform to do just that.

The new partnership is described as a “new TikTok U.S. joint venture” in an internal memo from ByteDance CEO Shou Chew, which was viewed by TechCrunch.

That arrangement will see major American investors take over significant control of the U.S.-based business. The newly formed investor group includes cloud giant Oracle, the tech-focused private equity firm Silverlake, and MGX, an Abu Dhabi-based investment firm focused on AI. Together, those companies will own 45% of the U.S. operation, while ByteDance retains a nearly 20% share, the memo states. The new entity formed by this partnership has been dubbed “TikTok USDS Joint Venture LLC.”

That new entity will be responsible for overseeing the app, including data protection, algorithm security, content moderation, and software assurance, the memo states. “A trusted security partner will be responsible for auditing and validating compliance with the agreed upon National Security Terms, and Oracle will be the trusted security partner upon completion of the transaction,” the document says.

The closing date for the deal is listed as January 22, 2026. The news was originally reported by Axios.

Much of the deal, as it has been described in the memo, parallels the language in an executive order signed by President Trump in September. That memo similarly approved the sale of TikTok’s U.S. operations to an American investor group. CNBC previously reported that Oracle, Silverlake, and MGX would be the primary investors in the deal. Until now, ByteDance had not divulged details of such a deal, except to say that it would abide by U.S. law to ensure that TikTok remained available to U.S. users.

The U.S. government has long sought to cleave TikTok’s U.S.-based business away from its Chinese parent company, espousing national security concerns as the rationale.

            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2025-12-19</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/2025/12/leucovorin-autism-folate-trump/685312/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">If President Donald Trump wanted Americans to take away one message about autism, it was this: Blame Tylenol. During his September press conference on the subject, Trump warned pregnant women more than a dozen times not to take the drug, even though two massive studies had found no meaningful association with the disorder in children. He also spread false rumors that “essentially no autism” can be found in Cuba or among the Amish. The other stated purpose of the event—the announcement of what FDA Commissioner Marty Makary called an “exciting treatment” for autism—was largely overshadowed by the president’s performance.

But parents of autistic children took note of that promised remedy. How could they not? Officials suggested that the little-known drug, leucovorin, could alleviate the symptoms of profound autism, perhaps allowing children with speech difficulties to find their words. Hundreds of thousands would benefit, according to Makary. No, it wasn’t a cure—officials stopped short of invoking that word—but it sounded like a miracle.

After the government’s endorsement, many parents rushed to get their hands on leucovorin. They soon discovered that they were effectively taking part in a nationwide experiment with few guidelines—assuming, that is, they could even get a prescription.

The theory behind treating autism with leucovorin is that the drug gives autistic kids something they’re missing. Children with autism seem to be more likely than other children to produce an antibody that prevents folate, also known as vitamin B9, from reaching their brain. Because folate plays a role in brain development, some researchers—most notable among them Richard Frye, a doctor who has been prescribing and promoting leucovorin for nearly two decades, and who told me he spoke with leaders in the Health and Human Services Department before the press conference—think these antibodies might hamper the growth of a child’s language abilities. Leucovorin is essentially a massive dose of folate, delivered in a form that can bypass those antibodies.

But that theory, which has long been debated in autism subreddits and Facebook groups, hasn’t gained traction among mainstream autism scientists. They point to a 2018 study that found that autistic children and their non-autistic siblings were equally likely to have these antibodies. The clinical evidence for leucovorin’s effectiveness for autistic kids is limited to a handful of small studies that don’t measure the same outcomes. No large, randomized, placebo-controlled trial has ever been conducted. If you want to get the drug for autism, it has to be prescribed off-label, which many doctors refuse to do.

Part of the Trump administration’s promise was to make leucovorin more accessible to patients and easier for doctors to prescribe. So far, nothing official has happened. At the press conference, Makary promised that the FDA would change leucovorin’s label so that doctors could start prescribing it to kids with autism. But when the FDA formally laid out its leucovorin plan two days later, it made no mention of autism. The plan instead centered on cerebral folate deficiency, an extremely rare genetic condition. Emily Hilliard, an HHS spokesperson, wrote in an email that “the FDA’s current action is focused specifically on cerebral folate deficiency,” noting that some of its symptoms overlap with autism. (My other questions about the administration’s leucovorin rollout went unanswered.) A spokesperson for GSK, which originally manufactured the drug and controls the label, told me that the company submitted an application for the label change this week.

During the press conference, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the secretary of health and human services, said that HHS would “help doctors treat children appropriately” with leucovorin. But Alycia Halladay, the chief science officer at the Autism Science Foundation, told me that physicians she’s spoken with have heard nothing from HHS. For her part, Halladay doesn’t believe that enough evidence exists to recommend leucovorin as an autism treatment. The American Academy of Pediatrics has also said that the current data are lacking. In a statement, the organization allowed that if physicians prescribe the medication, they should work with families to monitor side effects; some parents report increased hyperactivity and aggression after their kids take leucovorin.

Several researchers I spoke with compared the excitement about leucovorin to the enthusiasm for secretin, another drug that was popular as an autism treatment in the 1990s after early promising results. More rigorous clinical trials later showed that it wasn’t effective. Halladay said she’s heard from multiple doctors, including her child’s pediatrician, that they’ve been besieged with calls from parents hoping to get a prescription. One doctor in Chicago told me he had received dozens of inquiries.

In the absence of official advice on leucovorin, parents—almost always moms—of kids with profound autism have been turning to one another for opinions and encouragement online.

Some post regular updates on TikTok and Instagram detailing their kid’s progress on leucovorin, saying they’ve noticed more regular eye contact, fewer repetitive movements and sounds, or improvements in language use. In the comments, fellow parents complain about not being able to get the drug (“My sons pediatrician refuses, wants us to just wait for prescribing guidelines”), ask questions about dosage (“I just gave her 15 mg today is that too much??”), and wonder whether it’s really working (“how do we know we see results, what do we see?”). Others say their child’s behavior didn’t improve—or even grew worse—after taking the medication (“I didn’t see it helping my son more with speech like we hoped”).

Some insist the drug must be paired with vitamin B12, omega-3, or a certain amino acid; others caution that dairy can reduce its effectiveness. Many want to know about an antibody test that purports to indicate whether a child’s brain is receiving enough folate. But that test isn’t widely accepted as valid, and not all doctors are willing to give it.

Jessie Carrasco is one of those TikTok moms. She lives with her husband and their three children on the outskirts of the east-Texas city of Tyler. Their oldest son, Ezra, is 11 and has autism. He didn’t talk until he was 4; she credits fish-oil supplements, in part, with helping him speak in short sentences and respond to simple questions. (Some studies suggest that omega-3 fatty acids, found in fish oil, may improve communication in autistic children, though the evidence is mixed.) When Carrasco invited me into their backyard, which was lively with chickens and dogs, Ezra ran up, gave me a quick once-over, and then darted off to play on the swing set with his younger brother.

Carrasco learned about leucovorin after hearing Trump refer to a new treatment for autism during his speech at Charlie Kirk’s memorial service. She emailed Ezra’s nurse practitioner, who was willing to prescribe it but didn’t know enough about the drug to offer advice on how much to give Ezra or how to deal with potential side effects. Since then, Carrasco has posted more than 200 videos on TikTok, most of them documenting Ezra’s progress on leucovorin. One clip shows him serving himself food from a pot on the stove—the first time he’d ever done that, she told me. Her video of Ezra before and after taking the drug has nearly 6,000 likes.

“Since we’ve been giving leucovorin, I think everything that we’ve been trying to teach, he’s started to get it more and faster,” she said. Ezra’s behavioral analyst, Margaret Hawkins, told me that before leucovorin, she used to work with Ezra on pronouncing single words; now she’s coaching him on telling three- or four-sentence stories.

Read: When America’s views on autism started to change

Without Kennedy and Trump, Carrasco might not have learned about leucovorin; she’s grateful to them for giving her more faith in Ezra’s future, and hopes that the progress she’s seen so far won’t turn out to be a mirage. At the same time, she’s frustrated by the lack of information about how to use the drug and the difficulty she and other parents have had getting their hands on it. “I feel like they presented something and then just kind of left it in the dust,” she said. The last time she checked, the pharmacies in Tyler were out of leucovorin; she was planning to drive to a neighboring town to get more. “I got my hopes up and now I’m nervous,” she texted me recently. “I don’t wanna watch him regress.”

If the posts and comments are any indication, even parents who have managed to get prescriptions, like Carrasco, have been having trouble filling them. Whether the drug is in shortage now is unclear, but it has a history of supply problems going back more than a decade. A drug-shortage database maintained by a pharmacists’ association recently listed leucovorin shortages at five companies. (One of them, Teva, said its 25-milligram pills were in stock, but not its 5-milligram dose; the others either didn’t respond to me or couldn’t confirm whether they had supply issues.)

Perhaps because of shortages—or difficulties finding a doctor willing to prescribe leucovorin at all—some parents are turning to supplemental forms of folate. Such supplements are far less potent than leucovorin, but are usually cheaper and don’t require a prescription. (Even if leucovorin does turn out to be an effective autism treatment, it’s unknown whether low-dose supplements would have any effect.)

Offline, parents have been calling Frye, the longtime leucovorin doctor, who believes that as many as 1 million kids could benefit from the drug. He mostly treats children with significant language delays, though he says that the drug can sometimes help higher-functioning kids too. Frye was the lead author of a small 2016 study that found that children with autism who received leucovorin showed improvements in verbal communication, compared with those given a placebo; he also recently published a book called The Folate Fix. Ever since the press conference, his office has been inundated with calls and emails from parents who want the drug for their children.

For years, Frye has had a backlog of patients wanting to see him, but the White House announcement, he told me, made an “impossible situation worse.” He already has about 1,000 patients who are taking leucovorin, and he isn’t planning to accept any new ones until 2028. According to Frye, the FDA has asked him to submit an application to conduct clinical trials on leucovorin as an autism treatment, but last week, he told me that “not much is going on at this time.” He guesses those trials will take about two years. In the meantime, parents will be left to experiment with leucovorin on their own.</div>

            <h2>Millions of Americans May Soon Face Huge Costs</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2025-12-19</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/newsletters/2025/12/trump-affordability-health-care-costs/685328/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">This is an edition of The Atlantic Daily, a newsletter that guides you through the biggest stories of the day, helps you discover new ideas, and recommends the best in culture. Sign up for it here.

The president took a few moments out of his scattershot address to the nation last night to shield his party from blame over high health-care costs. If federal subsidies for the Affordable Care Act lapse at the end of the year, premiums may rise for more than 20 million Americans, dramatically worsening the affordability issues that are now top of mind for both parties. “It’s the Unaffordable Care Act,” Trump said. And a health-care system in crisis is “the Democrats’ fault.”

In fact, Democrats have consistently pushed to extend the subsidies; it was House Speaker Mike Johnson who said on Tuesday that the House would not vote on whether to continue funding the credits before the House’s holiday recess. Yesterday, a few GOP dissenters lent their signatures to a Democrat-led effort to force a vote, but they were outflanked by party members who oppose the credits (mostly on grounds that it costs too much and enables insurance fraud). Even if the House did put it to a vote before current funding for the subsidies expires on December 31, the Senate has already rejected the plan. Barring some drastic intervention, health-care costs will go up.

A month ago, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries predicted that either those subsidies would be renewed “or the American people will throw Republicans out of their jobs next year and end the speakership of Donald J. Trump once and for all.” His theory is about to be tested. When funding lapses in the new year, some Americans will see their costs double or triple. The average affected enrollee will see their costs rise by more than $1,000 annually. An education consultant in Chicago told NPR that her plan would increase from $180 a month to $1,200 a month. Many enrollees may no longer be able to pay for coverage at all; nearly 5 million people could become uninsured. An Ohio family said on MS NOW that because their new plan would cost $1,500 monthly with a $15,000 deductible, they are having to forgo coverage altogether. At a moment when the majority of Americans are dissatisfied with Trump’s stewardship of the economy, millions could soon be hit with a huge new expense.

That’s when the second part of Jeffries’s prediction starts to kick in. The 2026 midterms are almost a year away, so there’s plenty of time for public opinion to rebound—but as of now, Americans trust Democrats more than Republicans to handle the economy, per PBS, and the cost of living remains the top priority for Republicans and independents ahead of the midterms. Backlash to the Republican stance on the Affordable Care Act contributed to House Democrats’ resurgence in the 2018 midterms. Now GOP lawmakers will have to contend with the possibility that it could happen again.

During the recent government shutdown, which was largely caused by disagreements over whether to extend the ACA credits, Marjorie Taylor Greene, the far-right Georgia representative and former Trump ally, broke rank. “When the tax credits expire this year my own adult children’s insurance premiums for 2026 are going to DOUBLE, along with all the wonderful families and hard-working people in my district,” she wrote in October. Among the four centrist Republicans who defied Johnson yesterday by signing a Democrat-led discharge petition was Michael Lawler, the first Republican to represent his New York district since the early 1980s (he’s up for reelection next year). Also on the list is Brian Fitzpatrick, a representative for a battleground district in Pennsylvania. “I know my people back home care tremendously about this,” he said last week.

That sentiment extends well beyond Pennsylvania. Recent polling shows that 57 percent of Americans support the Affordable Care Act, and 74 percent support extending the credits. Responding to broader concerns about health-care costs, Trump recently unveiled TrumpRx, a new initiative to let consumers buy drugs directly from manufacturers at lower prices. But that can only do so much to offset a major insurance-premium spike. Health care involves more than just drugs—decreasing the sticker price for weight-loss and migraine medications won’t do much to cover a trip to the hospital for a broken leg.

Another tactic the administration is considering is simply handing out checks, which could help mitigate the impact of those expiring subsidies. In his speech yesterday, Trump announced a onetime bonus of $1,776 for all members of the military, and he has contemplated sending every American a neat sum of $2,000—part of his doubling down on affordability messaging. But these are Band-Aid solutions to long-term problems that have been exacerbated over the past year. Trump’s tariffs have played a large role in raising prices on all kinds of consumer goods. When the health-care cutbacks of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act go into effect next year, millions of Americans could be forced off Medicaid, opening them up to sky-high hospital bills. And even though Trump hasn’t spearheaded the fight against health-care credits, he said last month that he’d “rather not” extend them.

If insurance premiums rise, they will do so on Trump’s watch. Although it’s too early to know how that will affect next year’s midterms, come January, the affordability crisis could get even worse—and the GOP will have to confront its choices.

Here are three new stories from The Atlantic:

Warren Buffett has long been known and admired around the world for doing something that is, at its essence, mundane. He is not a brilliant artist or a great inventor or a record-setting athlete. Instead, his brilliance—a low-key, midwestern type of brilliance—found expression in the prosaic art of investing: buying this stock and avoiding that one. Buffett himself has called this task “simple, but not easy.” While millions upon millions of people buy and sell investments every day, no one has a record of doing it better than he has, as consistently as he has, and for as long as he has.

Explore. Lindsey Vonn and Philip Rivers show what can happen when athletes keep competing into their 40s, Sally Jenkins writes.

Read. In his newest book, Joe Sacco worries about what political violence might lead to, Robert Rubsam writes.

            <h2>The Risk of Trump’s Marijuana Order</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2025-12-19</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/2025/12/weed-rules-rescheduling-donald-trump/685329/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">For more than 50 years, America’s official position on marijuana has been seen as nonsensical. By classifying pot as a Schedule I drug, the federal government has lumped it with heroin and LSD as substances with “no currently accepted medical use and a high potential for abuse.” In 1972, two years after marijuana was relegated to the most restrictive category of drugs in America, a government report found that weed’s “actual impact on society does not justify a social policy designed to seek out and firmly punish those who use it.”

Even with the federal classification, states have been experimenting with marijuana legalization for nearly three decades. These laws have led to fewer marijuana-related arrests without dramatic increases in crime, and they haven’t substantially spiked the rate of illicit adolescent cannabis use. Although fully legalizing recreational marijuana remains controversial, it’s clear that smoking a joint from your local dispensary is not the same as using heroin.

Now America’s marijuana policies are getting a bit more in line with the actual science. Today, Donald Trump signed an executive order directing the government to move the drug to Schedule III, a classification for substances with “moderate to low potential for physical and psychological dependence.” As the president emphasized in the Oval Office, the action “doesn’t legalize marijuana in any way, shape, or form.” Selling marijuana without a prescription will still be a federal crime, just as trafficking anabolic steroids (also a Schedule III drug) is illegal.

The biggest impact from today’s action will likely be on medical research. Marijuana studies have been stymied because researchers who want to experiment with Schedule I drugs need to be closely vetted by the federal government. During the signing ceremony for the executive order, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. argued that the new classification will let scientists better understand the drug. That’s the hope of Ryan Vandrey, a cannabis researcher at Johns Hopkins University. Vandrey’s lab was cleared to do cannabis research while marijuana was still in Schedule I, but he hopes that this loosening of restrictions will open up “a huge number of possibilities for us to get at both the health benefits and health risks of cannabis as a whole,” he told me.

At the same time, by rescheduling the drug, the government runs the risk of signaling that marijuana is no big deal. “We need to be very clear in our messaging—especially to young people—that rescheduling does not mean cannabis is harmless,” Scott Hadland, a professor at Harvard Medical School and a pediatrician who treats adolescent addiction, told me. The government needs to figure out a way to tell Americans that even though marijuana is not as dangerous as heroin, it’s still an addictive drug. That’s not an easy message to communicate. Prior to signing the executive order today, the president touted the purported benefits of marijuana for certain medical conditions, but he also echoed the “Just Say No” drug campaign of decades past. “Unless a drug is recommended by a doctor for medical reasons, just don’t do it,” he said. (The White House did not respond to a request for comment.)

When talking about the risks of marijuana, you can easily to come off as a scold. Roughly 50 percent of Americans have tried the drug, and according to a 2024 study, the number of people using cannabis daily or near daily now eclipses the number who drink alcohol at a similar frequency. (Trump emphasized today that weed rescheduling polls well.) Even so, the risks of marijuana are real. The CDC estimates that three in 10 cannabis users exhibit some signs of dependency.

It doesn’t help that marijuana isn’t the same as when it was first scheduled, back in 1970. The drug has become significantly stronger over the past several decades. The average joint in the ’70s contained about 2 percent THC, the main psychoactive component of marijuana. In 2025, dispensaries regularly stock joints that have more than 35 percent THC. Studies have shown that use of higher-concentration marijuana is associated with serious mental-health outcomes, such as psychosis. In 2017, there were more than 100,000 hospitalizations for pot-linked psychosis, one study found. Vandrey said that he hopes rescheduling will help researchers better interrogate the “very strong correlation” between heavy marijuana use and psychosis.

None of this is to say that marijuana should stay a Schedule I drug, as it has for decades. In spite of this classification, millions of Americans have continued to use it. The government is now finally backing away from a misguided position about the risks of pot. But it still has to contend with the drug’s complications.</div>

What will you do about it? Nothing, as usual.  You whine and complain Russia is doing this to you, yet you do nothing in return.

Either punch the bully in the teeth with brass knuckles or stop complaining you&#39;ve been attacked.

As Ukraine has shown, taking the fight to the bully is the only way to get results.

            <div id="article-text">A lot of people think that social networks are the lowest form of shit on the internet, but in fact it&#39;s domain squatters. The practice should be illegal, punishable by both fines and being forced to sell the domain in an open auction for whatever the market will bear or relinquish it without recompense within 30 days.

So you&#39;re just going to seize somebody&#39;s because you&#39;ve decided that you don&#39;t like how they&#39;re using it?No, they&#39;re going to sell it to the highest bidder. You&#39;re going to need a tune-up on your translation software, Ivan.

No, they&#39;re going to seize a domain because it&#39;s being used *to commit a crime*.  That&#39;s a big difference.

What shocks me here is how long it took to become such a popular thing?  Parking domains isn&#39;t that expensive, but certainly isn&#39;t free, especially in large numbers.  The people doing the parking are basically squatting on property they speculate will have value down the road.  They may as well collect a little &quot;rent&quot; on them while they squat?

I can remember when &quot;domain tasting&quot; first became a thing, I looked at it and thought,  &quot;This is a TERRIBLE idea, it&#39;s going to make it more expensive for people to start up their own web site and &#39;interesting&#39; domains are going to be unobtainable by the average person just because some squatter thinks they&#39;re parked on gold.&quot;  No random person is going to pay thousands of dollars for a domain name they fancy just for a hobby, so it&#39;s just going to stifle small private sites.

I don&#39;t know how it currently works, but back when it started you could &quot;taste&quot; a domain for months almost for free, and there was nothing stopping you from &quot;tasting&quot; it again the instant your current taste expired,  So you could squat domains for an unlimited time almost for free.  &quot;gee, nobody would ever abuse that!&quot;

Though now with the explosion of TLDs, it&#39;s widened the market so far that the squatters are finding it hard to cover all the bases.  Raise their rent! (and make the price go up exponentially to KEEP it parked)  Watch the squatters scurry away like the cockroaches they are!

You will never find a more wretched hive of scum and villainy. We must be cautious.

Its people typing in domains, and going to random websites, yeah that&#39;s the problem! /sarc. More like its that the world wide web has become a transfer of executables, such that you can basically run an OS https://www.windows93.net/ [windows93.net] just think of the possibilities of running that level of code over just a basic document like how things used to be

Agreed. What&#39;s needed is a way to do essentially the same thing as AJAX without any client JS. There would be more latency with the processing happening on the server side, but that&#39;s an acceptable tradeoff for many purposes where it doesn&#39;t matter much.

Now they should sleep in it. Recipe sites have long been part of the worst of the internet with auto playing videos, pop-over adverts, and 15 pages of rubbish before the actual recipe.

The only sane way to get a recipe online is to look at the picture on Google, and if it looks good, paste the link into https://www.justtherecipe.com/ [justtherecipe.com]

100% this.  Recipe sites jumped hard on the SEO bandwagon, and became so hated for it that &quot;having to scroll down 15 pages to actually find the recipe&quot; became the butt of a joke.

Who cares they were always a bunch of chumps making money off public domain work while i had to work, they can find some new grift or get real jobs.

Or offer a good product that stands out over AI slop. Come to think of it, isn&#39;t this a good thing for someone exceptional? In a sea of crap, an oasis of good quality should be more in contrast right?

There may be a conflict of interest with Google directing traffic to websites that show ads.Google&#39;s ranking algorithm downgrades sites where content is dominated by ads, so I think the dynamic here is the other way around:  Recipe sites layered on huge numbers of ads in order to generate revenue, which caused their search ranking to drop, so then they had to go all-in on SEO to fool the ranking algorithm into raising their visibility.

Not a cause and effect situation.  Given this is a universal LMM issue across the web, recipe site bed shatting isn&#39;t why the LMM search engines aren&#39;t linking to source materials.

The point is that people who willingly contributed to the enshittification of the internet have no ground to stand no to complain about the enshittification of the internet.

It&#39;s not just that the pages are bad compared to what they should be. It&#39;s that most of those pages shouldn&#39;t even exist. If you don&#39;t have something new to say, you are just adding chaos to the world. I suspect 15 years ago it would have been easier to find quality recipes than it is today. Certain trustworthy publications are still great, but they typically do have something new to day.

Aye. Those sites are the very embodiment of the crap that inspired Pa to say, &quot;SHUT UP AND TALK!&quot;

Spite isn&#39;t a good reason to destroy. Is the person making this complaint one of the ones you have a beef with specifically? Because if not, the attitude of &quot;some recipe writer pissed me off therefore they&#39;re all scumbags and we should let google destroy everything&quot; doesn&#39;t really make sense to me.

Thing is they are not wrong, regardless of whether you personally like them.

People write stuff for all sorts of reasons. For clout. For fun. For money (ads). For the community. What literally no one does is write to anonymously feed google&#39;s bottom line with no recognition or remuneration. The internet is amazing because of the sheer breadth of stuff on it. And AI companies will happily kill the goose that laid the golden eggs, so they can feed you ads and get profit before people notice that there&#39;s nothing new in the slop.

Shooting the messenger because a different messenger wearing similar clothes annoyed you is just a terrible idea IMO.

Now I want to find that particular cookie recipe!

On a good site, hidden in those 15 pages of rubbish is often the &quot;why&quot;. And therein lies the difference between a list of ingredients and simple steps, and the details needed to cook something well. The demand for just the list without context is fine for those doggedly intent on learning nothing.

Recipes were mostly complete before the internet was even invented. I believe there from time to time something new and people may not have written about gummy bears on pizza before the internet, but when someone googles how to cook noodles, they could also have looked in grandma&#39;s cookbook.

The &quot;livelyhood of recipe writers&quot; is here a nice word for making money by slightly changing an existing recipe and putting it on a clickbait site, making sure not even the Google snippet tells what someone is searching

Recipes were mostly complete before the internet was even inventedBut the context around them has changed a lot. E.g.1. Newer devices have made it easier to do certain sorts of cooking, but it needs to modify the recipe ever so slightly for best results. E.g. Microwaves have become more common, air fryers.2. People doing 2 jobs in the last few decades are now not looking for BEST possible taste like the housewives of 1970s, but acceptable taste, hints at once a week meal prep work, and quick to make recipes.3. Availability of different types of partially cooked, precooked etc. ingredients has changed. Spam, corned beef, certain sauces that were common earlier has now given way to a much wider variety of intermediate food ingredients. These need to be explained in the newer recipes in a new way.4. Fusion. A lot more eastern spices are now available in the west, and western ones in the east. Many of them make sense in recipes from far away, if only one is ready for newer experiences. A recipe writer who has tried a few and suggests successful combination is far more important now than when the internet was invented in the 1950s.

I don&#39;t get air fryers. They are just fan ovens, but worse.

They&#39;re ovens that are faster to preheat.  Which shortens the cooking time of meals that are mostly pre-prepared, which is what most people eat (if you&#39;re preparing a meal from scratch, usually prep work takes up the preheating time)

But most of the air fryers in the UK are the wrong shape for pre-prepared meals, and most of those meals are best prepared with a microwave.

It just seems like an air fryer is worse. Take potatoes or meat. You can pile them into an air fryer, or you can spread them in a fan oven and optionally have a rotating platter to make sure they cook evenly. I suppose it&#39;s true that the volume is lower so they heat up faster. More messy to clean though.

I&#39;ve been winging it myself. I&#39;ve not really found anywhere that makes more than surprisingly basic use of a microwave, so I&#39;ve been experimenting on my own.

Yes, for a lot of dishes you can look to general purpose cookbooks (Joy of Cooking, or something like it). But a great part of the internet is that you can find regional dishes from all over the world. In fact, the very first thing I read when I got on the usenet in 1990 was from a recipe group.

...classic recipe books by famous cooks (Bocuse, Escoffier, Artusi, ...) are cheap, often available in the public domain or at bargain shops.

Hi lovelies! Welcome back to my little corner of the comment section! I am so incredibly excited to share this comment with you today. It is a family favorite, passed down through generations of posters, and it is honestly a total game-changer for weeknight reading. But before we get to the actual text of my opinion on this article, I just have to share a little story about my journey with digital content.

It was a crisp autumn morning in 1998. The leaves were turning that beautiful shade of red, and the sound of dial-up modems was in the air. My grandmother (rest in peace, Nana!) used to sit me on her knee and say, &quot;Sweetie, one day you’re going to read an article about Artificial Intelligence scraping content, and you’re going to need the perfect text-based response to go with it.&quot; She was so right.

I remember the way the sunlight hit the CRT monitor—it’s an unforgettable memory for me. Just like the way the aroma of roasting garlic fills a kitchen, the warmth of a flame war fills the soul. My hubby, who is a huge tech enthusiast (and my biggest taste-tester!), always says that the key to a good comment is the texture. You want it to be crunchy on the outside but soft and savory on the inside.

It’s 100% Organic: No LLMs were used in the making of this opinion! Quick & Easy: Once you scroll past 4,000 words, it takes seconds to read! Kid-Friendly: My kiddos beg for this comment every Tuesday night! Freezer Friendly: You can save this HTML and reheat it for later debates.

I know what you&#39;re thinking. &quot;User:Rei, do I really need another opinion on copyright law and the extinction of the ad-supported web?&quot; Trust me, you do. This isn&#39;t just any opinion. This is a curated opinion. ... [Subscribe to my Newsletter to remove ads] ...

A lot of people think the secret to a good Slashdot post is the insight. But actually? It’s the SEO optimization. When I went to Tuscany last summer to study under a master poster, I learned that the old ways are the best. We hand-kneaded our sentences for hours. It was exhausting, but so rewarding. It really made me appreciate the artisanal nature of the internet before Google&#39;s AI started making &quot;Frankenstein&quot; summaries.

Speaking of Frankenstein, isn&#39;t it funny how Mary Shelley really understood the human condition? Frankenstein tells the story of Victor Frankenstein, a young scientist who creates a sapient creature in an unorthodox scientific experiment that involved putting it together with different body parts. Shelley started writing the story when she was 18 and staying in Bath,[2] and the first edition was published anonymously in London on 1 January 1818, when she was 20. Her name first appeared in the second edition, which was published in Paris in 1821.

Shelley travelled through Europe in 1815, moving along the river Rhine in Germany, and stopping in Gernsheim, 17 kilometres (11 mi) away from Frankenstein Castle, where, about a century earlier, Johann Konrad Dippel, an alchemist, had engaged in experiments.[3][4][5] She then journeyed to the region of Geneva, Switzerland, where much of the story takes place. Galvanism and occult ideas were topics of conversation for her companions, particularly for her lover and future husband Percy Bysshe Shelley.

In 1816 —at the suggestion of Lord Byron— Mary, Percy, John Polidori and Byron himself, each agreed to try writing a ghost story.[6] After thinking for days, Shelley was inspired to write Frankenstein after imagining a scientist who created life and was horrified by what he had made.[7] The novel was first published anonymously in 1818, and in 1831, a revised edition was published under Mary Shelley&#39;s name. This version included significant stylistic revisions, a new preface describing the story&#39;s conception, and a more explicitly mo

You do realise what they said applies to basically every category of site? Google want to feed you their own rehashed version of other people&#39;s works so you will stay with google, seeing google&#39;s ads and google gets to keep everything.

No one is going to produce anything to anonymously feed google&#39;s bottom line. If they keep this up it will destroy the best of the internet.

I thought it was just me as ChatGPT assured me that this dish would be awesome.

Sure, I think that some sites should just fuck off and die. All Recipes and the like are good examples. Anything that just warehouses user submitted works, or that bubble recipes up and down based on likes and dislikes. &quot;I made it, but instead of whole milk I used almond milk, half the salt, used ginger instead of galongal, and didn&#39;t process the lemongrass. Didn&#39;t like it. One star, would not make again.&quot; You shouldn&#39;t get a vote, numbnuts.

Gather around. Here is a useful heuristic to understand the shabby, campy, and uniquely unserious nature of this incarnation of the Trump presidency.

For the past several weeks, much attention has been paid to Alexis Wilkins, the 27-year-old country-singer girlfriend of FBI Director Kash Patel. This alone is unusual. Generally speaking, FBI directors are not meant to be understood as tabloid celebrities with rich personal lives. But the scandal that has enveloped the both of them is even more chintzy, in a perfectly Trumpian way. Basically, since getting sworn in to the role, Patel has used a Gulfstream jet owned by the agency to buttress his vacation time. This includes flying to concerts at which Wilkins is performing, and to a luxury hunting lodge in Texas called Boondoggle Ranch. This is the sort of controversy that raises a lot of questions—about taxpayer dollars, Patel’s ego, and why the current administration seems to be permanently occupied by manchildren stuck in various stages of arrested development. But Patel, for his part, has decided to address the charges head-on in the only way he knows how: Step in front of a podcast microphone, on a couch next to his girlfriend, and dress down the haters and losers.

The show in question is The Katie Miller Podcast, and, naturally, it is hosted by Katie Miller, wife of skull-measuring psychopath and White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller. The podcast has platformed a cavalcade of regime-boosting sycophants, and Patel is no different. Between whining complaints about the press (hi, Kash!), boasts about his threadbare criminal justice bona fides, and mandated tributes to the genius of Donald Trump, he uses the opportunity to settle some scores. Miller asks Patel about the claims that he is mishandling FBI resources in service of his personal life, a credible accusation that he nonetheless finds completely outrageous. “If I was actually abusing [the jet], I would actually be seeing every one of her shows,” Patel says. “I think I get to, like, 15 percent.” Hilariously, the episode of the podcast opens with solemn text embossed on a black screen, informing viewers that the interview was recorded before the horrific mass shooting at Brown University. As of this writing, the FBI has yet to apprehend a suspect. (Update, Dec, 19, 12:09 a.m.: The suspect has been found dead in a storage unit. Unfortunately, the rest of this story stands.)

As we just described at Slate, Katie Miller is a mind-numbingly dull interviewer, but this thing still goes on for 50 minutes, and it’s completely dominated by pablum. At one point, Miller asks Wilkins if she disagrees with Patel on anything significant. She stumbles over the potential political ramifications of the query before informing listeners that the FBI director likes spicy food, while she does not. Scintillating stuff.

Miller, who is adjacent to the conspiracy network that animates the MAGA media ecosystem, also opens up a discussion about whether Wilkins is an Israeli spy. Apparently, this is an assertion that gets batted around in the dankest corners of fascist Discords. (Among the comments underneath the YouTube video for a vibeless Wilkins track called “GRIT,” one reads, “This is exactly what I imagine Mossad agent singing country music would sound like.”) Wilkins responds by saying that she has never been to Israel.

If there is one theme throughout the dialogue, it is Patel laying the blame for all of his grievances at the feet of the fourth estate. In that sense, he’s following a well-worn track laid out by Trump. But Patel’s demeanor is genuinely baffling. My favorite of these swipes is when Miller asks Patel when he might get engaged to Wilkins. He retorts by saying that he won’t “let the media determine the speed in which this relationship moves.” What? What are you talking about, man? I implore every boyfriend reading this to give that line a shot the next time the topic of marriage comes up: “The New York Times doesn’t control me!!” Let me know how it goes.

I guess this is what counts as damage control in the spiraling psychedelia of Trump 2.0. It doesn’t seem likely that the fiasco surrounding Patel’s chartered flights is going to stick for long, if only because this version of the White House has made highly visible corruption a defining aesthetic. Only months ago, we learned that border czar Tom Homan accepted a bag of $50,000 in cash from FBI agents, and we breezed right past it. I mean, yes, Democrats in the House Judiciary Committee are probing Patel’s flight logs, which could surface more-embarrassing information. But I’m not holding my breath over here.

Maybe none of this is really damage control at all. Sometimes it really seems as if Wilkins is the first girlfriend Patel has ever had. The idea that he needed to appear on Miller’s podcast with Wilkins to “clear the air” or whatever belies a more visceral purpose—to issue another reminder, for the American people, that the FBI director is getting laid. There is a bushy-tailed earnestness in the way Patel trumpets this information, a spiral-eyed mania of a man who, at last, is on the receiving end of positive interaction with a woman and wants to rub it in our faces. Frankly, once you understand the cretins in Trump’s orbit through that framing, a lot about this current moment begins to make sense.

This week, Emily Bazelon, John Dickerson, and David Plotz discuss the vivid and impulsive portrait Susie Wiles paints of Trump’s White House in a revealing interview with Vanity Fair, what the new unemployment numbers say about the economy and how Americans are feeling about it, and why some studies show that young Americans are increasingly antisemitic.

            <div id="article-text">Hewlett Packard Enterprise has told customers to drop whatever they&#39;re doing and patch OneView after admitting a maximum-severity bug could let attackers run code on the management platform without so much as a login prompt.

The vulnerability, tracked as CVE-2025-37164 and rated a maximum 10.0 on the CVSS scale, affects HPE OneView versions 5.20 through 10.20 and allows unauthenticated remote code execution, according to an advisory published by the company this week. OneView sits at the heart of many enterprise environments, serving as a central control plane for servers, firmware, storage, and lifecycle management.

&quot;A potential security vulnerability has been identified in Hewlett Packard Enterprise OneView Software,&quot; HPE said in its advisory. &quot;This vulnerability could be exploited, allowing a remote unauthenticated user to perform remote code execution.&quot;

HPE said the issue was reported by security researcher Nguyen Quoc Khanh and is urging customers to either upgrade to OneView 11.0 or apply the emergency hotfix immediately. Separate fixes are available for the OneView virtual appliance and for HPE Synergy deployments.

Rapid7, which has analyzed the vulnerability and the vendor&#39;s hotfix, told The Register that the real danger isn&#39;t just code execution, but where it happens. OneView is typically deployed deep inside the network with sweeping privileges and minimal scrutiny, because it&#39;s assumed to be trustworthy. An unauthenticated RCE at that layer doesn&#39;t just open a door – it hands over the keys to the building.

In other words, popping OneView could give an attacker centralized control over large chunks of infrastructure at scale, rather than access to a single compromised box. That makes it a far more attractive target than the average edge-facing server bug.

Rapid7&#39;s initial inspection of the hotfix suggests the vulnerability is tied to a specific REST API endpoint exposed by the appliance. The fix works by blocking access to that endpoint at the web server level, and the firm said it has a high degree of confidence that this endpoint is the primary access vector.

HPE has not said whether the flaw is being actively exploited, but history suggests bugs like this don&#39;t stay theoretical for long. Highly privileged management platforms are often targeted by ransomware crews and other attackers seeking shortcuts past perimeter defenses.

For now, if you&#39;re running a vulnerable version of OneView, patch or upgrade immediately. Rapid7, meanwhile, suggests defenders treat the issue as an assumed-breach scenario, review network segmentation, and stop treating infrastructure management layers as untouchable. ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Britain is set to become a post-3G nation as Virgin Media O2 (VMO2) prepares to be the last of the country&#39;s mobile networks to switch off its 3G service, although it may linger for a while at a few sites.

The operator says that its rivals have completed their switch-offs and now the firm is set to complete its own program &quot;in the coming weeks&quot; following a series of successful pilots throughout 2025.

The sale of 3G licences at the turn of the century cost UK operators billions and the technology never really lived up to its hype ...

VMO2&#39;s telecoms turn-off started with the city of Durham in northeast England back in April, and saw it withdrawing 3G services in Scotland from early November.

Customers who haven&#39;t upgraded to a 4G or 5G device before 3G is switched off in their area will still be able to make calls and send text messages, the company says, but they won&#39;t be able to access mobile data. That would mean they won&#39;t be able to use websites and many phone apps will no longer function.

The same applies to subscribers of mobile providers that use VMO2 to deliver their services, such as Giffgaff, Tesco Mobile and Sky Mobile.

As we have noted previously, this all stems from plans announced in 2021 by the previous UK government for all 2G and 3G mobile networks to be phased out of use by 2033.

BT/EE completed its switch-off in early 2024, as did Vodafone, while Three was understood to have concluded its process by November of last year, although there were reports of a small number of sites still providing a 3G service into 2025, to &quot;avoid customers losing service.&quot;

The same may happen with VMO2, according to the firm&#39;s chief technology officer, Jeanie York.

&quot;Our 3G network has already been withdrawn across many UK locations, with the final areas set to follow shortly. You may still see a 3G signal in some places for a short period in early 2026, but the network will soon be switched off entirely, so I&#39;d like to take this opportunity to urge anybody who is still using a 3G-only handset to please visit your local store, or call us, to upgrade as soon as possible,&quot; she stated.

We&#39;re well aware that when we have written about the 3G switch-off in the past, some readers complained that 3G was the only service they could reliably get in their area. Presumably, these are the areas where &quot;you may still see a 3G signal for a short period.&quot;

The government has been pushing the network companies to hit 95 percent coverage of the country by the end of this year, although there were doubts that this target would be reached. BT claims it expects to have a 5G Standalone (5G SA) mobile service available to 99 percent of the population by the end of the decade.

&quot;This is a necessary move for the industry; 3G carries only a tiny fraction of all mobile data and reallocating spectrum to 4G and 5G networks will give more people a better overall smartphone experience,&quot; said Kester Mann, director of Consumer and Connectivity at CCS Insight.

Turning off 3G marks the end of an era. It was the first mobile technology able to offer a reasonable experience for mobile browsing when it arrived in the UK in March 2003. Before that, phone users had to rely on something called Wireless Application Protocol (WAP), which the mere mention of will bring a shudder to those old enough to remember it.

However, 3G also had something of a shaky start in the UK. Network operators bid billions of pounds for their 3G licenses in a government auction, which left them cash-strapped when it came to actually building anything. The initial rollout was plagued with problems, and the first operator, Three, failed to make a profit for several years after its launch.

&quot;Not everyone will mourn its closing,&quot; said Mann. &quot;The sale of 3G licences at the turn of the century cost UK operators billions and the technology never really lived up to its hype. Its successor, 4G, was credited with supporting many of the uses of today&#39;s smartphones,&quot; he added.

Paolo Pescatore, analyst and founder at PP Foresight, was even more scathing.

&quot;Amen to 3G, one of the most overhyped network technologies with unmet expectations, inflated spectrum auctions, complex, slow network build and a terrible user experience,&quot; he commented.

&quot;Transitioning to 4G and 5G has not been easy due to the need to support legacy M2M and IoT devices. Looking back, hindsight is a wonderful thing; 4G addressed the shortcomings of 3G.&quot; ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Exclusive Airbus is preparing to tender a major contract to migrate mission-critical workloads to a digitally sovereign European cloud – but estimates only an 80/20 chance of finding a suitable provider.

The aerospace manufacturer, which has already consolidated its datacenter estate and uses services like Google Workspace, now wants to move key on-premises applications including ERP, manufacturing execution systems, CRM, and product lifecycle management (aircraft designs) to the cloud.

&quot;I need a sovereign cloud because part of the information is extremely sensitive from a national and European perspective,&quot; Catherine Jestin, Airbus&#39;s executive vice president of digital, told The Register. &quot;We want to ensure this information remains under European control.&quot;

The driver is access to new software. Vendors like SAP are developing innovations exclusively in the cloud, pushing customers toward platforms like S/4HANA.

The request for proposals launches in early January, with a decision expected before summer. The contract – understood to be worth more than €50 million – will be long term (up to ten years), with price predictability over the period.

Digital sovereignty has become more critical since Donald Trump&#39;s return to the White House in January. His policies created volatility in trade and geopolitical relations, prompting European customers to reduce reliance on US providers.

While Microsoft, AWS, and Google have created solutions to address these concerns, fears persist about the US CLOUD Act, which allows authorities to request data held by American corporations in overseas datacenters.

Microsoft admitted in French court last July it couldn&#39;t guarantee data sovereignty under this legislation.

Jestin is waiting for European regulators to clarify whether Airbus would truly be &quot;immune to extraterritorial laws&quot; – and whether services could be interrupted.

The concern isn&#39;t theoretical. Chief Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court (ICC) Karim Khan reportedly lost access to his Microsoft email after Trump sanctioned him for criticizing Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu, though Microsoft denies suspending ICC services.

Beyond US complications, Jestin questions whether European cloud providers have sufficient scale. &quot;If you asked me today if we&#39;ll find a solution, I&#39;d say 80/20.&quot;

This puts pressure on European providers to collaborate, though whether they can navigate such complexities in Airbus&#39;s timeframe remains uncertain. ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">A year or two ago, when a phone showed up at my door for review, I could pretty much count on it being black, gray, or maybe (as a treat) white. But in 2025, that hasn’t been the case. Phones I reviewed this year featured everything from real wood grain back panels to deep blue finishes, with color-coordinated crossbody straps and magnetic accessories to match. For an industry that has been content to churn out a lot of black rectangular gadgets, 2025 marked a welcome return to bold colors and fashion-forward accessories from phone manufacturers.

Phones haven’t always been boring, utilitarian objects. Remember the original bright pink Motorola Razr? Iconic. Or more recently, Nokia’s neon yellow Lumia phones — you couldn’t miss them. Even the ever-conservative iPhone appeared in vibrant orange, yellow, and blue options in 2018’s XR; my husband refused to part with his until absolutely necessary because he didn’t want to give up his yellow phone. But somewhere along the way in the past five years, phone makers decided that these devices should be more serious, and the fun options fell by the wayside.

If any single company deserves recognition for bringing style back, it’s Motorola. The Razr Ultra foldable in MountainTrail is easily the best-looking phone I used this year, but maybe I’m just partial to the Moto X vibes the wooden back evokes. The bronze-colored side rails, the satisfying sound as the flip phone snaps shut — it’s all so nice. But it’s not just foldables — Motorola has been way ahead of the curve with vibrant colors and unique finishes for the past year or so. I wish Moto’s software looked as pristine — lately it’s been stuffed to the gills with ads and bloatware — but the company has definitely nailed good-looking hardware.

Even product lines that are traditionally conservative with color got some splashier options this year. 2025 gave us the Cosmic Orange iPhone 17 Pro, for the truly bold among us. The standard iPhone 17 also comes in some fetching colors, which hasn’t been a given in recent years — no repeat of the iPhone 15’s washed-out color options, thankfully. Even Google offered its folding phone in something other than black or white for the first time: a gray-ish Moonstone and a subtle greenish-yellow Jade.

But it hasn’t been just the phones themselves. This year, manufacturers seemed to remember that phone accessories can be fashionable, too. Apple launched this year’s iPhones with a new crossbody strap accessory, available in a range of colors to coordinate with its cases. And later in the year, we got the crossbody sock, er, iPhone Pocket, created with fashion designer Issey Miyake. Starting at $229 for the long version, it’s a luxury that won’t appeal to most people, but it makes a strong statement.

Google also released a line of magnetic accessories called Pixelsnap to go with its Pixel 10 series, which includes a ring of MagSafe-esque magnets in the rear panel. I used the Pixel 10 Pro Fold almost exclusively with the handy ring grip, which, in addition to relieving some of the fatigue from holding the phone for a long time, doubles as a nice-looking object adorning the back of the phone. For someone like me who hates using cases, it’s a welcome way to add utility and a hint of style.

Not everyone wants a flashy color or statement-making accessory for their phone, and that’s fine. But I think it’s also fine to care about how your phone looks and to want something a little less utilitarian and a little more fashionable than a black rectangle. After all, we look at our phones one million times a day! It only makes sense that we should like what we see. Whatever was in the water this year encouraging manufacturers to fancy up their phones, I hope it sticks around in 2026.

            <div id="article-text">﻿Local fights against new data centers are gaining bipartisan support across the US.

﻿Local fights against new data centers are gaining bipartisan support across the US.

If there’s one thing Republicans and Democrats came together on in 2025 — at least at the local level — it was to stop big, energy-hungry data center projects.

For communities sick of rising electricity bills and pollution from power plants, data centers have become an obvious target. Fights against new data centers surged this year as grassroots groups, voters, and local lawmakers demanded more accountability from developers. Already, they’ve managed to block or stall tens of billions of dollars’ worth of potential investment in proposed data centers. And they’re not letting up.

“We expect that opposition is going to keep growing,” says Miquel Vila, an analyst at the research firm Data Center Watch who’s been tracking campaigns against data centers across the US since 2023.

“We expect that opposition is going to keep growing.”

The group’s latest report found that developers either canceled or delayed 20 projects after facing pushback from locals, representing $98 billion in proposed investments in the second quarter of this year. In fact, from late March through June, $24.2 billion in projects were blocked and $73.7 billion delayed. That’s an increase compared to 16 blocked or postponed projects from 2023 through the first quarter of this year, the group notes.

The number of proposed data center projects has grown, which is a big reason why opposition is also picking up steam. Inventory in the four biggest data center markets in North America — Northern Virginia, Chicago, Atlanta, and Phoenix — grew by 43 percent year-over-year in the first quarter of this year, according to commercial real estate company CBRE. But plans for massive new facilities have also sparked battles across the nation.

Data centers eat up a lot of electricity, particularly for more powerful chips used for new AI models. Power demand for data centers is expected to grow by 22 percent by the end of the year compared to last year. A high-density rack of servers in an AI data center might use as much as 80 to 100 homes’ worth of power, or upward of 100 kilowatts, according to Dan Thompson, a principal research analyst at S&P Global. AI also requires a lot of water to keep servers cool and generate electricity and could use as much annually as the indoor needs of 18.5 million US households by 2028 by one estimate.

Google dropped its plans for a new data center in Franklin Township, Indiana, in September after residents raised concerns about how much water and electricity the new data center would use. The Indianapolis City-County Council was reportedly expected to deny the project’s rezoning application. That victory for residents in Indiana isn’t captured in the Data Center Watch report, which is only updated with information through June.

Other data center projects that are moving forward or already operating still face resistance. Elon Musk’s xAI, for example, faces a potential lawsuit from the NAACP and Southern Environmental Law Center over pollution from its data center in Memphis. Peak nitrogen dioxide concentration levels have jumped by 79 percent in the area surrounding the data center since it started operating in 2024, according to research from the University of Tennessee, Knoxville requested by Time magazine.

xAI, which is building a second, larger data center in Memphis, didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment from The Verge, but says “We’re moving toward a future where we will harness our cluster’s full power to solve intractable problems,” on its website.

“No community should be forced to sacrifice clean air, clean water, or safe homes so that corporations and billionaires can build energy-hungry facilities,” the NAACP said in guiding principles that it shared with The Verge in September for other grassroots groups working to hold data center developers accountable for their impact on nearby neighborhoods.

Meta is facing a backlash against its largest data center yet planned for Richland Parish, Louisiana. Local utility Entergy broke ground this month on two of three gas plants it’s building to meet that facility’s electricity demands, expected to reach triple the amount of power New Orleans uses in a year. “Entergy LA customers are now set to subsidize Meta’s data center costs,” the Union of Concerned Scientists says in a November blog post, including an estimated $3.2 billion for the three gas-fired plants and a new $550 million transmission line. Entergy, on the other hand, contends that “Meta’s electric payments to Entergy will lower what customers pay for resilience upgrades by approximately 10%,” according to communications manager Brandon Scardigli.

“Our agreement with Entergy was structured to ensure that other customers are not paying for our data center energy use,” Meta spokesperson Ashley Settle says in an email to The Verge. Settle adds that Meta is contributing $15 million to Entergy’s ratepayer support program and more than $200 million for local infrastructure improvements.

Rising electricity costs became a flashpoint during November elections in the US this year, helping to propel two Democrats to the governor’s offices in New Jersey and Virginia. New Jersey residents have faced one of the steepest rises in power prices of any state in the nation, while Virginia is home to “data center alley,” through which 70 percent of internet traffic passes.

“Now, we have a bogey man — data centers who are these large energy users who are coming in, and in many states, getting sweetheart deals on wholesale electricity prices, when regular consumers don’t have that type of sway,” Tony Reames, a professor of environmental justice at the University of Michigan and former Department of Energy official under President Biden, said to The Verge after the election.

States, both red and blue, are starting to set some limits on those sweetheart deals. After South Dakota lawmakers rejected a bill that would have offered developers sales tax refunds, Applied Digital paused plans for a $16 billion AI campus in the state. Virginia, Maryland, and Minnesota, meanwhile, have introduced legislation attempting to rein in tax incentives for data centers or energy costs for other consumers, the Data Center Watch report says.

Nationally, more than 230 health and environmental groups have called for a moratorium on data center construction. The organizations, led by the nonprofit Food & Water Watch, sent a letter to Congress with their demands in December. They argue that there aren’t enough policies in place to prevent data centers from burdening nearby communities with higher bills and more pollution. President Donald Trump released an “AI Action Plan” in July that aims to speed data center development in part by rolling back environmental regulations.

With midterm elections next year, we’re likely to see more data center fights playing into local politics, Vila expects. “It’s going to be very interesting to track how this opposition impacts the regulatory framework,” he says.

            <div id="article-text">﻿A spoiler-filled discussion of the Apple TV series’ eighth episode.

﻿A spoiler-filled discussion of the Apple TV series’ eighth episode.

Things might finally be looking up. In the penultimate episode of Pluribus’ first season, Carol (Rhea Seehorn) actually seems to be happy. That’s a pretty big deal for someone the show describes as the “most miserable person on Earth,” who also happens to be living through an odd sort of apocalyptic scenario that she is desperately fighting to stop. But what does her change in demeanor mean for the show as it moves toward the finale?

Welcome to our weekly Verge-subscriber discussion of Pluribus, the new sci-fi series on Apple TV from Breaking Bad creator Vince Gilligan. The show follows Carol as one of a handful of “survivors” on Earth after a virus of unknown origin turns the rest of the world into an interconnected hive mind. The hive is cheerful, Carol is not, and all kinds of drama follows. Each week, I present a handful of questions from the latest episode to get a conversation started, so feel free to chime away in the comments with your own thoughts, theories, and questions. We’re getting very close to the end now, so naturally spoilers follow for the first eight episodes of Pluribus.

This week’s episode actually started with Manousos (Carlos-Manuel Vesga) who, after a dangerous accident in a rainforest at the end of episode seven, finds himself waking up in a hospital in Panama. He is not happy about it — even though the hive saved his life. That’s because Manousos absolutely despises the hive and has thus far refused any help from them, going so far as to torch his beloved car to keep them away from it. In this case, he tries to make up for the medical help by paying a nonexistent hospital bill. Then he’s off driving an ambulance to continue his trek to see Carol in New Mexico.

Carol, meanwhile, is living it up. After spending quite a bit of time on her own, she’s now hanging out with her hive mind chaperone Zosia (Karolina Wydra) as if they were close friends. They go for hikes and massages; they play cards together. Along the way, Carol learns a few more important things about the hive. For one, they communicate using some form of electric current, and it happens unconsciously, “like breathing.” They also have kept the trains running in order to transport food, they sleep huddled together in large spaces like hockey arenas to conserve resources, and they’re building some kind of giant telescope in order to send a signal back to Kepler-22b, where the virus originated.

Perhaps most importantly, she learns that one of the reasons Zosia is spending so much time with her is to keep Carol busy and make her forget about saving the world from the hive. So here we are, one episode away from the finale, and I have a few lingering questions I’m thinking about as we approach the end.

At first, it seemed pretty genuine. After being so lonely, Carol was starving just to get a hug, and having a lot of personal time with Zosia seemed to do her good. But once she learned the hive are trying to distract her, Carol’s behavior changed — at least initially. So now I’m wondering if her current cheerful disposition is a front so that the hive don’t get suspicious that she is once again investigating them. Then again, things take a very unexpected turn at the end, so maybe I’m wrong, and her feelings toward the hive — or at least Zosia — have changed.

It sure seemed like the answer was no before, but now it’s a little less clear. After some struggles, Zosia was eventually able to speak using “I” instead of “we,” which points to the possibility that, somewhere deep inside, individual humans still exist within the hive.

At the end of the episode, Zosia tells Carol that “you’re going to have a visitor.” So it seems that the finale will finally include the two hive skeptics meeting up. But they also both have very strong personalities, so I wonder how well they’ll actually work together when it comes to saving the world (if Carol even wants to save it anymore).

China figured out how to sell EVs. Now it has to bury their batteries.

It’s a weird time to be an AI doomer.This small but influential community believes, in the simplest terms, that AI could get so good it could be bad—very, very bad—for humanity.The doomer crowd has had some notable success over the past several years: including helping shape AI policy coming from the Biden administration. But a number of developments over the past six months have put them on the back foot. Talk of an AI bubble has overwhelmed the discourse as tech companies continue to invest in multiple Manhattan Projects’ worth of data centers without any certainty that future demand will match what they’re building.So where does this leave the doomers? We decided to ask some of the movement’s biggest names to see if the recent setbacks and general vibe shift had altered their views. See what they had to say in our story.—Garrison Lovely

Synthesia’s AI clones are more expressive than ever. Soon they’ll be able to talk back.

Earlier this summer, I visited the AI company Synthesia to create a hyperrealistic AI-generated avatar of me. The company’s avatars are a decent barometer of just how dizzying progress has been in AI over the past few years, so I was curious just how accurately its latest AI model, introduced last month, could replicate me.I found my avatar as unnerving as it is technically impressive. It’s slick enough to pass as a high-definition recording of a chirpy corporate speech, and if you didn’t know me, you’d probably think that’s exactly what it was.My avatar shows how it’s becoming ever-harder to distinguish the artificial from the real. And before long, these avatars will even be able to talk back to us. But how much better can they get? And what might interacting with AI clones do to us? Read the full story.

            <h2>China figured out how to sell EVs. Now it has to bury their batteries.</h2>
            <p><strong>MIT Technology Review | 2025-12-18</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/12/18/1130148/china-ev-battery-recycle/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">In August 2025, Wang Lei decided it was finally time to say goodbye to his electric vehicle.

Wang, who is 39, had bought the car in 2016, when EVs still felt experimental in Beijing. It was a compact Chinese brand. The subsidies were good, and the salesman talked about “supporting domestic innovation.” At the time, only a few people around him were driving on batteries. He liked being early.

But now, the car’s range had started to shrink as the battery’s health declined. He could have replaced the battery, but the warranty had expired; the cost and trouble no longer felt worth it. He also wanted an upgrade, so selling became the obvious choice.

His vague plans turned into action after he started seeing ads on Douyin from local battery recyclers. He asked around at a few recycling places, and the highest offer came from a smaller shop on the outskirts of town. He added the contact on WeChat, and the next day someone drove over to pick up his car. He got paid 8,000 yuan. With the additional automobile scrappage subsidy offered by the Chinese government, Wang ultimately pocketed about 28,000 yuan.

Wang is part of a much larger trend. In the past decade, China has seen an EV boom, thanks in part to government support. Buying an electric car has gone from a novel decision to a routine one; by late 2025, nearly 60% of new cars sold were electric or plug-in hybrids.

But as the batteries in China’s first wave of EVs reach the end of their useful life, early owners are starting to retire their cars, and the country is now under pressure to figure out what to do with those aging components.

The issue is putting strain on China’s still-developing battery recycling industry and has given rise to a gray market that often cuts corners on safety and environmental standards. National regulators and commercial players are also stepping in, building out formal recycling networks and take-back programs, but so far these efforts have struggled to keep pace with the flood of batteries coming off the road.

Like the batteries in our phones and laptops, those in EVs today are mostly lithium-ion packs. Their capacity drops a little every year, making the car slower to charge, shorter in range, and more prone to safety issues. Three professionals who work in EV retail and battery recycling told MIT Technology Review that a battery is often considered to be ready to retire from a car after its capacity has degraded to under 80%. The research institution EVtank estimates that the year’s total volume of retired EV batteries in China will come in at 820,000 tons, with annual totals climbing toward 1 million tons by 2030.

In China, this growing pile of aging batteries is starting to test a recycling ecosystem that is still far from fully built out but is rapidly growing. By the end of November 2025, China had close to 180,000 enterprises involved in battery recycling, and more than 30,000 of them had been registered since January 2025. Over 60% of the firms were founded within the past three years. This does not even include the unregulated gray market of small workshops.

Typically, one of two things happens when an EV’s battery is retired. One is called cascade utilization, in which usable battery packs are tested and repurposed for slower applications like energy storage or low-speed vehicles. The other is full recycling: Cells are dismantled and processed to recover metals such as lithium, nickel, cobalt, and manganese, which are then reused to manufacture new batteries. Both these processes, if done properly, take significant upfront investment that is often not available to small players.

But smaller, illicit battery recycling centers can offer higher prices to consumers because they ignore costs that formal recyclers can’t avoid, like environmental protection, fire safety, wastewater treatment, compliance, and taxes, according to the three battery recycling professionals MIT Technology Review spoke to.

“They [workers] crack them open, rearrange the cells into new packs, and repackage them to sell,” says Gary Lin, a battery recycling worker who worked in several unlicensed shops from 2022 to 2024. Sometimes, the refurbished batteries are even sold as “new” to buyers, he says. When the batteries are too old or damaged, workers simply crush them and sell them by weight to rare-metal extractors. “It’s all done in a very brute-force way. The wastewater used to soak the batteries is often just dumped straight into the sewer,” he says.

This poorly managed battery waste can release toxic substances, contaminate water and soil, and create risks of fire and explosion. That is why the Chinese government has been trying to steer batteries into certified facilities. Since 2018, China’s Ministry of Industry and Information Technology has issued five “white lists” of approved power-battery recyclers, now totaling 156 companies. Despite this, formal recycling rates remain low compared with the rapidly growing volume of waste batteries.

China is not only the world’s largest EV market; it has also become the main global manufacturing hub for EVs and the batteries that power them. In 2024, the country accounted for more than 70% of global electric-car production and more than half of global EV sales, and firms like CATL and BYD together control close to half of global EV battery output, according to a report by the International Energy Agency. These companies are stepping in to offer solutions to customers wishing to offload their old batteries. Through their dealers and 4S stores, many carmakers now offer take-back schemes or opportunities to trade in old batteries for discount when owners scrap a vehicle or buy a new one.

BYD runs its own recycling operations that process thousands of end-of-life packs a year and has launched dedicated programs with specialist recyclers to recover materials from its batteries. Geely has built a “circular manufacturing” system that combines disassembly of scrapped vehicles, cascade use of power batteries, and high recovery rates for metals and other materials.

CATL, China’s biggest EV maker, has created one of the industry’s most developed recycling systems through its subsidiary Brunp, with more than 240 collection depots, an annual disposal capacity of about 270,000 tons of waste batteries, and metal recovery rates above 99% for nickel, cobalt, and manganese.

“No one is better equipped to handle these batteries than the companies that make them,” says Alex Li, a battery engineer based in Shanghai. That’s because they already understand the chemistry, the supply chain, and the uses the recovered materials can be put to next. Carmakers and battery makers “need to create a closed loop eventually,” he says.

But not every consumer can receive that support from the maker of their EV, because many of those manufacturers have ceased to exist. In the past five years, over 400 smaller EV brands and startups have gone bankrupt as the price war made it hard to stay afloat, leaving only 100 active brands today.

Analysts expect many more used batteries to hit the market in the coming years, as the first big wave of EVs bought under generous subsidies reach retirement age. Li says, “China is going to need to move much faster toward a comprehensive end-of-life system for EV batteries—one that can trace, reuse and recycle them at scale, instead of leaving so many to disappear into the gray market.”

The idea that machines will be as smart as—or smarter than—humans has hijacked an entire industry. But look closely and you’ll see it’s a myth that persists for many of the same reasons conspiracies do.

            <div id="article-text">Not long ago, like many of you, I read what I feared might be The Next Web’s final article. In late September, TNW’s co-founder announced that the tech conference and news site would be winding down, no more events, no new stories. It felt like the end of an era; the news hit hard.

Yet, just a few weeks ago, a twist arrived: the tech platform Tekpon acquired 100% of TNW’s media and events brand from the Financial Times, ensuring that this nearly two-decade legacy will continue to thrive.

While, myself, trying to read people’s opinions on this topic, I read this comment in one article, from one former TNW editor-in-chief that said: “The Next Web shaped my career, my life… it’s very sad to see it die”.

The latest rumblings from the EU tech scene, a story from our wise ol&#39; founder Boris, and some questionable AI art. It&#39;s free, every week, in your inbox. Sign up now!

I asked myself: Why do we always assume that just because one chapter ends, the whole story is over? Yes, taking over TNW is a heavy inheritance, especially with all eyes on us and expectations sky-high.

And I’ll admit, doubts crept in: Am I too small for this? Could someone more experienced do it better? Probably. But here I am, stepping up regardless. Because this isn’t just another blog or brand; TNW is a living ecosystem, a vital community. Its story deserves to continue, and I’m determined to help write the next chapter.

I also know some of you might be wondering: Who is she? What does she know? How many articles has she written? What recommends her?

Before reading all sorts of titles and, let me briefly introduce myself.

I’ve been writing since high school, with thousands of articles under my belt; covering everything from culture, art, and hip hop to design, politics, history, and food. I landed my first content writer job at 18, and alongside writing I pursued another passion: becoming a chef.

(Fun fact: I even made it to the semifinals of MasterChef, a journey that taught me about creativity under pressure and staying cool when the heat is on.)

Now, I channel my storytelling skills into helping businesses better understand technology and use it to their advantage. I help companies tell their stories, the real ones, finding meaning and flow in every word.

Over the years, I’ve specialized in blending creative storytelling with the technical precision of a chef’s knife. (My colleagues at Tekpon might say I can be as sharp as that knife – true to my values and quick to cut through the nonsense.) I am also the “No, we have to do it right” person in the team.

I’ve reviewed countless software products, interviewed founders, and explored how digital innovation can be a force for good in society. Or not. In other words, I’ve always cared about the why behind the tech, the real impact on people’s lives, not just the buzz. That perspective will be behind every story we will publish at TNW.

If there’s a place for those who still think stories written by humans matter, tell me where it is. I’m already on my way.

I’m not here to change TNW’s DNA; I’m here to reinforce it with fresh energy and a clear vision for the future.

To the loyal TNW readers, to the startup founders who looked to us for inspiration, to the healthy tech skeptics who counted on us for a reality check, and to our global audience spread across continents: we hear you.

We all know the world of tech news has changed dramatically. Today, everyone has a megaphone, social media overflows with hot takes, and AI algorithms can crank out content in seconds. It’s easy to feel overwhelmed by this sea of opinions and auto-generated articles. In such a world, the role of a publication like TNW is more critical than ever: to be a filter, not just another firehose of content.

We will focus on curation and clarity, distilling the noise so you don’t have to.

Here’s the good news: despite the deluge of AI-written text out there, readers are actively looking for authentic, human journalism. Every article we will publish will be created by a human writer who is accountable for the facts and who brings context, analysis, and yes, a bit of personality too.

Our mission isn’t to chase every trending headline algorithmically; it’s to help you understand which innovations actually matter, and why.

If a story is everywhere but lacks substance, we won’t regurgitate it; we’ll analyze it or debunk it. If a breakthrough is genuinely promising, we’ll explain why it’s important and how it impacts real people. Being a thoughtful filter in this age of information overload (and AI-generated noise) isn’t just a catchy slogan for us; it’s a responsibility we embrace.

You’ll also notice something different in our approach: an emphasis on storytelling and the human side of tech. Technology doesn’t exist in a vacuum; it’s built and used by people with dreams, dilemmas, and diverse backgrounds.

I believe, and I suspect many of you do too, that the best tech journalism zooms out from the gadgets and code to highlight those human stories. Practically speaking, expect to see more features, interviews, and narrative-driven pieces on TNW.

We’ll talk to founders about the messy, human journey of building a startup, not just the press releases or funding announcements. We’ll spotlight the engineers, designers, and thinkers who are trying to solve big problems (or even small ones that make a big difference). We’ll explore tech’s impact on society: the good, the bad, and the complicated.

This won’t be a place for recycled press releases or surface-level takes. It will be a place for conversation and insight.

Importantly, none of this focus on storytelling means we’ll skimp on rigor. Being engaging doesn’t mean sacrificing accuracy or depth. My team will continue to prioritize thorough research and fact-checking, those good old-school journalism values, even as we experiment with new formats and new voices. In short, we won’t publish anything we wouldn’t want to read ourselves.

Today, looking forward means acknowledging that how we cover tech is as important as what we cover. It means committing to journalism that cuts through the clutter, to storytelling that puts people first, and to a vision of tech’s future that is both hopeful and honest. That’s my vision for TNW as I step into this role, and I hope it resonates with you.

Now, I’d like to turn it over to you, our community. This is your TNW as much as it is ours. I invite you to join the conversation. Tell us what you want to see more of (or less of). Hold us accountable,if we ever fall short, let us know. Share your stories and perspectives with us, because they can inspire our coverage.

In the coming weeks, you’ll start to see this vision take shape on the site. You’ll see familiar faces and new voices. You’ll find articles that make you think, others that make you smile, and hopefully quite a few that make you proud to be a TNW reader.

Whether you’re a long-time follower who’s stuck with us through thick and thin, a startup founder looking for insight, a skeptic keeping us honest, or a curious mind tuning in from anywhere in the world – thank you.  We do this for you, and we couldn’t do it without you.

The Next Web is back. We’re here to inform you, inspire you, challenge you, and occasionally even surprise you. I’m honored to have you with us on this journey. Here’s to the road ahead, to storytelling, to journalism (the real kind), and to making sense of the future together.

Thank you for reading, and welcome to TNW’s next chapter. Let’s build it, day by day, story by story, together.

            <h2>Is ChatGPT’s New Shopping Research Solving a Problem, or Creating One?</h2>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">When OpenAI announced its new shopping search capabilities, I took the news with a grain of salt (perhaps the whole shaker).
For the past decade, we have watched the slow evolution of traditional search engines. What began as tools for pure information discovery gradually morphed into ecosystems dominated by SEO-optimized content and sponsored results. My initial fear with ChatGPT’s update was simple: Are we seeing the beginning of a similar shift? Is the purity of the “reasoning engine” being diluted by the necessity of commerce?
After testing the new shopping integration, the results suggest that we are at a pivotal moment in the user experience of Generative AI, one that requires an open discussion about what we actually want these tools to be.

The defining characteristic of Large Language Models (LLMs) is their ability to handle nuance. When we interact with ChatGPT, we expect a Socratic dialogue. We expect the AI to ask clarifying questions to narrow down our intent.
To test this, I entered a simple prompt: “I want to buy a vacuum.”
I anticipated a conversation, questions about my home’s square footage, my floor type, or my budget. Instead, the conversational nuance was replaced by a display that felt familiar: a grid of product photos, names, prices, and direct links to retailers.

While efficient, this experience felt like a regression. It mirrored the “keyword search” experience of Web 2.0 rather than the “intent-based” promise of GenAI. It replied to my prompt, but it stripped away the intelligence.

Scrolling down, I engaged with the new feature in a call to action: “Research the best vacuums.”
This is where the user experience (UX) friction became most apparent. Rather than synthesizing data or comparing technical specifications in a chat format, the tool presented a polling interface designed to filter results.

The experience is oddly time-sensitive; pause too long to think or drink water, and the screens will skip forward, dumping you back into a list of product cards.
The interface presents products with a binary choice: “More like this” or “Not interested.” It offers brand names and price tags, but virtually no information to help the user actually make a choice.

For a user seeking genuine research, being presented with a list of brands and prices without deep comparative analysis feels like a missed opportunity.
It raises a question: If I wanted to filter products by price and brand, wouldn’t I use a traditional retailer? The value proposition of Gen AI should be synthesis, not just aggregation.

The Tension Between Reasoning and Revenue
This update highlights the inevitable tension facing major AI companies: the balance between user utility and business sustainability.
As OpenAI scales, the pressure to demonstrate revenue models to investors is natural. However, there is a risk in prioritizing transactional features before the core product, reasoning and logic, is fully matured. By introducing a shopping experience that feels closer to a “click-through” engine than a “knowledge” engine, the platform risks blurring its own identity.
Is ChatGPT a research partner that helps me think? Or is it a shopping assistant trying to speed me to checkout?

To be clear, I believe there is a place for shopping within AI. But the execution matters.
A truly Generative AI shopping experience shouldn’t just list products; it should understand the user. It should read between the lines of a prompt to understand that a user asking for a vacuum might actually be solving a problem about pet hair or allergies.

The current iteration feels like a beta test of a business model rather than an evolution of intelligence. As we move forward, the hope is that OpenAI will refine this tool to prioritize the “Chat” over the transaction. We don’t want it to be just another place to see ads. We need a better way to make decisions.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Tekpon has acquired 100% of the TNW media and events brands, which cover and convene the European technology ecosystem, from the FT.

The transaction is Tekpon’s largest investment in media and events so far. It broadens the company’s reach across SaaS and AI and strengthens its role in the global innovation landscape.

TNW’s brand and editorial standards will be maintained, while its events and digital platforms will be integrated into Tekpon’s wider strategy.

The FT will continue to own and operate TNW Spaces, Amsterdam’s dynamic tech hub, offering private offices and coworking spaces that support a thriving community of startups, scale-ups, and innovators.

Alexandru Stan, Founder and CEO of Tekpon, said:

TNW City Coworking space - Where your best work happens

A workspace designed for growth, collaboration, and endless networking opportunities in the heart of tech.

TNW is one of Europe’s most respected technology brands. Its legacy, its community, and its influence have shaped the European tech scene for nearly twenty years. This acquisition accelerates our mission to connect the global SaaS and AI ecosystem and supports Europe’s position in the next decade of innovation.

Tekpon will begin working on TNW branded initiatives immediately. Plans for 2026 include an expanded TNW Conference, new SaaS and AI program tracks curated by Tekpon, cross-regional executive programmes, and specialised gatherings for founders, executives, and investors.

The acquisition is part of Tekpon’s long-term plan to build an international ecosystem connecting software, media, events, advisory, and innovation.
