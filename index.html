            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Enforcement against polluters in the United States plunged in the first year of President Donald Trump’s second term, a far bigger drop than in the same period of his first term, according to a new report from a watchdog group.

By analyzing a range of federal court and administrative data, the nonprofit Environmental Integrity Project found that civil lawsuits filed by the US Department of Justice in cases referred by the Environmental Protection Agency dropped to just 16 in the first 12 months after Trump’s inauguration on Jan. 20, 2025. That is 76 percent less than in the first year of the Biden administration.

Trump’s first administration filed 86 such cases in its first year, which was in turn a drop from the Obama administration’s 127 four years earlier.

“Our nation’s landmark environmental laws are meaningless when EPA does not enforce the rules,” Jen Duggan, executive director of the Environmental Integrity Project, said in a statement.

The findings echo two recent analyses from the nonprofits Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility and Earthjustice, which both documented dwindling environmental enforcement under Trump.

From day one of Trump’s second term, the administration has pursued an aggressive deregulatory agenda, scaling back regulations and health safeguards across the federal government that protect water, air and other parts of the environment. This push to streamline industry activities has been particularly favorable for fossil fuel companies. Trump declared an “energy emergency” immediately after his inauguration.

At the EPA, Administrator Lee Zeldin launched in March what the administration called the “biggest deregulatory action in U.S. history”: 31 separate efforts to roll back restrictions on air and water pollution; to hand over more authority to states, some of which have a long history of supporting lax enforcement; and to relinquish EPA’s mandate to act on climate change under the Clean Air Act.

The new report suggests the agency is also relaxing enforcement of existing law. Neither the White House nor the EPA responded to a request for comment.

Part of the decline in lawsuits against polluters could be due to the lack of staff to carry them out, experts say. According to an analysis from E&E News, at least a third of lawyers in the Justice Department’s environment division have left in the past year. Meanwhile, the EPA in 2025 laid off hundreds of employees who monitored pollution that could hurt human health.

Top agency officials are also directing staff to issue fewer violation notices and reduce other enforcement actions. In December, the EPA formalized a new “compliance first” enforcement policy that stresses working with suspected violators to correct problems before launching any formal action that could lead to fines or mandatory correction measures.

“Formal enforcement … is appropriate only when compliance assurance or informal enforcement is inapplicable or insufficient to achieve rapid compliance,” wrote Craig Pritzlaff, who is now a principal deputy assistant EPA administrator, in a Dec. 5 memo to all enforcement officials and regional offices.

Only in rare cases involving an immediate hazard should enforcers use traditional case tools, Pritzlaff said. “Immediate formal enforcement may be required in certain circumstances, such as when there is an emergency that presents significant harm to human health and the environment,” he wrote.

Federal agencies like the EPA, with staffs far outmatched in size compared to the vast sectors of the economy they oversee, typically have used enforcement actions not only to deal with violators but to deter other companies from breaking the law. Environmental advocates worry that without environmental cops visible on the beat, compliance will erode.

Pritzlaff joined the EPA last fall after five years heading up enforcement for the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality, where nonprofit watchdog group Public Citizen noted that he was known as a “reluctant regulator.” Public Citizen and other advocacy groups criticized TCEQ under Pritzlaff’s leadership for its reticence to take decisive action against repeat violators.

One example: An INEOS chemical plant had racked up close to 100 violations over a decade before a 2023 explosion that sent one worker to the hospital, temporarily shut down the Houston Ship Channel and sparked a fire that burned for an hour. Public Citizen said it was told by TCEQ officials that the agency allowed violations to accumulate over the years, arguing it was more efficient to handle multiple issues in a single enforcement action.

“But that proved to be untrue, instead creating a complex backlog of cases that the agency is still struggling to resolve,” Public Citizen wrote last fall after Pritzlaff joined the EPA. “That’s not efficiency, it’s failure.”

Early last year, TCEQ fined INEOS $2.3 million for an extensive list of violations that occurred between 2016 and 2021.

The EPA doesn’t always take entities to court when they violate environmental laws. At times, the agency can resolve these issues through less-formal administrative cases, which actually increased during the first eight months of Trump’s second term when compared to the same period in the Biden administration, according to the new report.

However, most of these administrative actions involved violations of requirements for risk management plans under the Clean Air Act or municipalities’ violations of the Safe Drinking Water Act. The Trump administration did not increase administrative cases that involve pollution from industrial operations, Environmental Integrity Project spokesperson Tom Pelton said over email.

Another signal of declining enforcement: Through September of last year, the EPA issued $41 million in penalties—$8 million less than the same period in the first year of the Biden administration, after adjusting for inflation. This suggests “the Trump Administration may be letting more polluters get by with a slap on the wrist when the Administration does take enforcement action,” the report reads.

Combined, the lack of lawsuits, penalties, and other enforcement actions for environmental violations could impact communities across the country, said Erika Kranz, a senior staff attorney in the Environmental and Energy Law Program at Harvard Law School, who was not involved in the report.

“We’ve been seeing the administration deregulate by repealing rules and extending compliance deadlines, and this decline in enforcement action seems like yet another mechanism that the administration is using to de-emphasize environmental and public health protections,” Kranz said. “It all appears to be connected, and if you’re a person in the US who is worried about your health and the health of your neighbors generally, this certainly could have effects.”

The report notes that many court cases last longer than a year, so it will take time to get a clearer sense of how environmental enforcement is changing under the Trump administration. However, the early data compiled by the Environmental Integrity Project and other nonprofits shows a clear and steep shift away from legal actions against polluters.

Historically, administrations have a “lot of leeway on making enforcement decisions,” Kranz said. But this stark of a drop could prompt lawsuits against the Trump administration, she added.

“Given these big changes and trends, you might see groups arguing that this is more than just an exercise of discretion or choosing priorities [and] this is more of an abdication of an agency’s core mission and its statutory duties,” Kranz said. “I think it’s going to be interesting to see if groups make those arguments, and if they do, how courts look at them.”

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Amid a push toward AI agents, with both Anthropic and OpenAI shipping multi-agent tools this week, Anthropic is more than ready to show off some of its more daring AI coding experiments. But as usual with claims of AI-related achievement, you’ll find some key caveats ahead.

On Thursday, Anthropic researcher Nicholas Carlini published a blog post describing how he set 16 instances of the company’s Claude Opus 4.6 AI model loose on a shared codebase with minimal supervision, tasking them with building a C compiler from scratch.

Over two weeks and nearly 2,000 Claude Code sessions costing about $20,000 in API fees, the AI model agents reportedly produced a 100,000-line Rust-based compiler capable of building a bootable Linux 6.9 kernel on x86, ARM, and RISC-V architectures.

Carlini, a research scientist on Anthropic’s Safeguards team who previously spent seven years at Google Brain and DeepMind, used a new feature launched with Claude Opus 4.6 called “agent teams.” In practice, each Claude instance ran inside its own Docker container, cloning a shared Git repository, claiming tasks by writing lock files, then pushing completed code back upstream. No orchestration agent directed traffic. Each instance independently identified whatever problem seemed most obvious to work on next and started solving it. When merge conflicts arose, the AI model instances resolved them on their own.

The resulting compiler, which Anthropic has released on GitHub, can compile a range of major open source projects, including PostgreSQL, SQLite, Redis, FFmpeg, and QEMU. It achieved a 99 percent pass rate on the GCC torture test suite and, in what Carlini called “the developer’s ultimate litmus test,” compiled and ran Doom.

It’s worth noting that a C compiler is a near-ideal task for semi-autonomous AI model coding: The specification is decades old and well-defined, comprehensive test suites already exist, and there’s a known-good reference compiler to check against. Most real-world software projects have none of these advantages. The hard part of most development isn’t writing code that passes tests; it’s figuring out what the tests should be in the first place.

The compiler also has clear limitations that Carlini was upfront about. It lacks a 16-bit x86 backend needed to boot Linux from real mode, so it calls out to GCC for that step. Its own assembler and linker remain buggy. Even with all optimizations enabled, it produces less efficient code than GCC running with all optimizations disabled. And the Rust code quality, while functional, does not approach what an expert Rust programmer would produce. “The resulting compiler has nearly reached the limits of Opus’s abilities,” Carlini wrote. “I tried (hard!) to fix several of the above limitations but wasn’t fully successful. New features and bugfixes frequently broke existing functionality.”

Those limitations may actually be more informative than the successes. Carlini reports that toward the end of the project, fixing bugs and adding features “frequently broke existing functionality,” a pattern familiar to anyone who has watched a codebase grow beyond the point where any contributor fully understands it.

And that limitation is even more common when dealing with AI coding agents, which lose coherence over time. The model hit this wall at around 100,000 lines, which suggests a practical ceiling for autonomous agentic coding, at least with current models.

Anthropic describes the compiler as a “clean-room implementation” because the agents had no Internet access during development. But that framing is somewhat misleading. The underlying model was trained on enormous quantities of publicly available source code, almost certainly including GCC, Clang, and numerous smaller C compilers. In traditional software development, “clean room” specifically means the implementers have never seen the original code. By that standard, this isn’t one.

On Hacker News, the distinction drew sharp debate, reflective of a controversial reception to the news among developers. “It was rather a brute force attempt to decompress fuzzily stored knowledge contained within the network,” wrote one commenter.

The $20,000 figure also deserves some context. That number covers only API token costs and excludes the billions spent training the model, the human labor Carlini invested in building the scaffolding, and the decades of work by compiler engineers who created the test suites and reference implementations that made the project possible.

And that scaffolding was not trivial, which makes any claim of “autonomous” work on the C compiler among the AI agents dubious. While the headline result is a compiler written without human pair-programming, much of the real work that made the project function involved designing the environment around the AI model agents rather than writing compiler code directly. Carlini spent considerable effort building test harnesses, continuous integration pipelines, and feedback systems tuned for the specific ways language models fail.

He found, for example, that verbose test output polluted the model’s context window, causing it to lose track of what it was doing. To address this, Carlini designed test runners that printed only a few summary lines and logged details to separate files.

He also found that Claude has no sense of time and will spend hours running tests without making progress, so he built a fast mode that samples only 1 percent to 10 percent of test cases. When all 16 agents got stuck trying to fix the same Linux kernel bug simultaneously, he used GCC as a reference oracle, randomly compiling most kernel files with GCC and only a subset with Claude’s compiler, so each agent could work on different bugs in different files.

“Claude will work autonomously to solve whatever problem I give it,” Carlini wrote. “So it’s important that the task verifier is nearly perfect, otherwise Claude will solve the wrong problem.”

None of this should obscure what the project actually demonstrates. A year ago, no language model could have produced anything close to a functional multi-architecture compiler, even with this kind of babysitting and an unlimited budget. The methodology of parallel agents coordinating through Git with minimal human supervision is novel, and the engineering tricks Carlini developed to keep the agents productive (context-aware test output, time-boxing, the GCC oracle for parallelization) could potentially represent useful contributions to the wider use of agentic software development tools.

Carlini himself acknowledged feeling conflicted about his own results. “Building this compiler has been some of the most fun I’ve had recently, but I did not expect this to be anywhere near possible so early in 2026,” he wrote. He also raised concerns rooted in his previous career in penetration testing, noting that “the thought of programmers deploying software they’ve never personally verified is a real concern.”</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">As the 2026 Olympic Winter Games begin today, news articles are swelling with juicy claims that male ski jumpers have injected their penises with fillers to gain a flight advantage.

As the rumor goes, having a bigger bulge on a required 3D body scan taken in the pre-season could earn jumpers extra centimeters of material in their jumpsuits—and a suit’s larger nether regions provide more surface area to glide to the gold. Even a small increase can make a satisfying difference in this sport. A 2025 simulation-based study published in the journal Frontiers in Sports and Active Living suggested that every 2 cm of extra fabric in a ski jumpsuit could increase drag by about 4 percent and increase lift by about 5 percent. On a jump, that extra 2 cm of fabric amounts to an extra 5.8 meters, the simulations found.

Elite ski jumpers are aware of the advantage and have already crotch-rocketed to scandal with related schemes. Last year, two Norwegian Olympic medalists, Marius Lindvik and Johann Andre Forfang, and three of their team officials were charged with cheating after an anonymous video showed the head coach and suit technician illegally restitching the crotch area of the two jumpers’ suits to make them larger. The jumpers received a three-month suspension, while the head coach, an assistant coach, and the technician faced a harsher 18-month ban.

Injections are alleged to be a new, more drastic strategy. Rumors that jumpers were internally padding their peckers first came to light in January, when German newspaper Bild reported that there were “whispers” of jumpers using hyaluronic acid or possibly paraffin injections.

Bild quoted Dr. Kamran Karim, a specialist at Maria-Hilf Hospital in Krefeld, Germany, as saying (translated): “There is the possibility of obtaining a temporary, optical thickening of the penis with the injection of paraffin or hyaluronic acid. … Such an injection, however, is not medically indicated and involves risks.”

On Thursday, the injection claims sprang up again at a press conference in which journalists asked officials of the World Anti-Doping Agency about the claims. The agency’s director general said they were not aware of any claims and that non-doping means of enhancing performance are not in their purview. But according to the BBC, WADA President Witold Banka, who is from Poland, was “clearly entertained” by the questions, responding: “Ski jumping is very popular in Poland, so I promise you I’m going to look at it.”

Bruno Sassi, the communications director for FIS, the international ski and snowboard federation, seemed less amused, telling the BBC, “There has never been any indication, let alone evidence, that any competitor has ever made use of a hyaluronic acid injection to attempt to gain a competitive advantage.”

But what if they did? Here’s what we know about hyaluronic acid and paraffin for penis augmentation.

While some news outlets have played up the “acid” part of its name, hyaluronic acid is not some nefarious flesh-melting hazard. It’s a common filler used for various clinical purposes.

Hyaluronic acid is a polysaccharide that is naturally found in a wide variety of tissues in the human body, including the skin, eyes, and connective tissue. It’s a chief component of the extracellular matrix. It attracts water molecules to itself, creating volume that can provide structural support. In a pure form, it has no tissue or even species specificity and therefore is considered to have little risk of sparking immune responses.

As such, hyaluronic acid gel fillers are used in a variety of medical procedures, with approval from the Food and Drug Administration. Hyaluronic acid (HA) fillers are injected into joints, particularly knees, to relieve pain from mild to moderate arthritis, which can decrease the natural amount of HA in joints. Age also decreases natural levels of HA, and one of the main uses of HA fillers is for cosmetic purposes—plumping lips and cheeks, and minimizing the appearance of wrinkles and fine lines in the face. HA fillers can also be used inside the eye in a variety of surgeries, including cataract extraction and corneal transplants. It can also be used topically for wound care and to relieve skin pain and itching.

For these purposes, the most common adverse effects are pain, bruising, redness, itching, and swelling, which usually last for just a few days. In extremely rare cases, there can be more serious side effects from injections, such as bacterial infections, tissue death (from blocked blood flow), and a granulomatous foreign body reaction, in which the immune system tries to clear a foreign substance, such as bacterial impurities, leading to a collection of immune cells.

A notable feature of HA fillers is that they have something of an antidote. For procedures that go wrong for whatever reason, clinicians can use hyaluronidase, an enzyme that breaks down hyaluronic acid, to dissolve the filler. Hyaluronidase is then rapidly deactivated and degraded in the body. But even without any dissolving, HA fillers offer only temporary effects, lasting between eight weeks and up to six months, for the various established uses.

What is not on the list of established clinical purposes for HA fillers is penis augmentation. But that’s not from a lack of trying. Studies have looked at the possibility of using HA fillers for adding girth and length—and some of have reported positive results. But so far, there’s a lack of evidence to support safety and efficacy. Still, that hasn’t stopped cosmetic clinics around the world from offering it anyway.

In a 2022 study in the Asian Journal of Andrology, researchers in China followed 38 patients who had HA filler injections, which seemed to provide desired results. One month after injections, the men saw an average increase of 3.4 cm in girth and 2.5 cm in length when flaccid. After a year, the measurements had decreased, but were still an increase of 2.4 cm in girth and 1.65 cm in length. Erect girth ended at an average increase of 0.8 cm. The researchers reported that only three patients had complications: two had swelling, and one had bleeding under the skin. All three cases resolved on their own.

However, not all reports are so rosy. In a 2021 case study in BMC Urology, researchers in Australia reported the experience of a 31-year-old man who received penis HA fillers at a cosmetic clinic. He developed a severe penis infection soon after that led to sepsis and multi-organ failure, landing him in the intensive care unit. Doctors ended up surgically removing pus-stained filler from his penis, which laboratory tests found teeming with Streptococcus pyogenes.

Another case study in 2021, published in a Japanese urology journal, reported that a 65-year-old man had to have part of his penis surgically removed after having HA fillers injected into the head of his penis. When he arrived at the hospital, black necrotic lesions and ulcers were readily visible.

While things can go wrong with HA fillers, despite their legitimate clinical uses, the outcomes for paraffin injections are much darker. Amid the Olympics scandal, most of the focus has been on hyaluronic acid. But the initial Bild article introduced speculation that skiers could also use paraffin injections to jack up their junk, which would be a terrible idea.

The use of injections of mineral oil or paraffin wax for cosmetic procedures dates back to at least 1899, when it was almost immediately found to have horrifying results. The injections lead to what’s called paraffinoma, in which the body tries to encapsulate and sequester the oil it can’t degrade. The result is tissue that looks like swiss cheese—with large spaces filled with oil. Over time, the tissue becomes thickened and scarred and can block lymphatic drainage. From the outside, it results in disfiguring and debilitating lesions. Some people initially ignored these disturbing results because, in some cases, the lesions can take years to develop.

While such injections have largely been abandoned, cases occasionally crop up. That includes a 2002 report of a 64-year-old Michigan man who self-injected his penis with mineral oil to increase its girth. He used a series of shots over the course of 18 months. Two years after the last shot, he went to urologists because of an increasing mass in his penis that was causing erectile dysfunction and making it difficult to urinate. He reluctantly admitted to the oil injections only after his doctors suspected cancer. In the end, the doctors had to surgically remove the mass of oily nodules from all around his penis and circumcise him.

Whatever is going on in the trousers of Olympic ski jumpers, let’s hope it doesn’t involve paraffin.</div>

            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2026/02/randomly-quoting-ray-bradbury-did-not-save-lawyer-from-losing-case-over-ai-errors/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Frustrated by fake citations and flowery prose packed with “out-of-left-field” references to ancient libraries and Ray Bradbury’s Fahrenheit 451, a New York federal judge took the rare step of terminating a case this week due to a lawyer’s repeated misuse of AI when drafting filings.

In an order on Thursday, district judge Katherine Polk Failla ruled that the extraordinary sanctions were warranted after an attorney, Steven Feldman, kept responding to requests to correct his filings with documents containing fake citations.

One of those filings was “noteworthy,” Failla said, “for its conspicuously florid prose.” Where some of Feldman’s filings contained grammatical errors and run-on sentences, this filing seemed glaringly different stylistically.

It featured, the judge noted, “an extended quote from Ray Bradbury’s Fahrenheit 451 and metaphors comparing legal advocacy to gardening and the leaving of indelible ‘mark[s] upon the clay.’” The Bradbury quote is below:

“Everyone must leave something behind when he dies, my grandfather said. A child or a book or a painting or a house or a wall built or a pair of shoes made. Or a garden planted. Something your hand touched some way so your soul has somewhere to go when you die, and when people look at that tree or that flower you planted, you’re there. It doesn’t matter what you do, he said, so long as you change something from the way it was before you touched it into something that’s like you after you take your hands away. The difference between the man who just cuts lawns and a real gardener is in the touching, he said. The lawn-cutter might just as well not have been there at all; the gardener will be there a lifetime.”

Another passage Failla highlighted as “raising the Court’s eyebrows” curiously invoked a Bible passage about divine judgment as a means of acknowledging the lawyer’s breach of duty in not catching the fake citations:

“Your Honor, in the ancient libraries of Ashurbanipal, scribes carried their stylus as both tool and sacred trust—understanding that every mark upon clay would endure long beyond their mortal span. As the role the mark (x) in Ezekiel Chapter 9, that marked the foreheads with a tav (x) of blood and ink, bear the same solemn recognition: that the written word carries power to preserve or condemn, to build or destroy, and leaves an indelible mark which cannot be erased but should be withdrawn, let it lead other to think these citations were correct.

I have failed in that sacred trust. The errors in my memorandum, however inadvertent, have diminished the integrity of the record and the dignity of these proceedings. Like the scribes of antiquity who bore their stylus as both privilege and burden, I understand that legal authorship demands more than mere competence—it requires absolute fidelity to truth and precision in every mark upon the page.”

Although the judge believed the “florid prose” signaled that a chatbot wrote the draft, Feldman denied that. In a hearing transcript in which the judge weighed possible sanctions, Feldman testified that he wrote every word of the filings. He explained that he read the Bradbury book “many years ago” and wanted to include “personal things” in that filing. And as for his references to Ashurbanipal, that also “came from me,” he said.

Instead of admitting he had let an AI draft his filings, he maintained that his biggest mistake was relying on various AI programs to review and cross-check citations. Among the tools that he admitted using included Paxton AI, vLex’s Vincent AI, and Google’s NotebookLM. Essentially, he testified that he substituted three rounds of AI review for one stretch reading through all the cases he was citing. That misstep allowed hallucinations and fake citations to creep into the filings, he said.

But the judge pushed back, writing in her order that it was “extremely difficult to believe” that AI did not draft those sections containing overwrought prose. She accused Feldman of dodging the truth.

“The Court sees things differently: AI generated this citation from the start, and Mr. Feldman’s decision to remove most citations and write ‘more of a personal letter&#39;” is “nothing but an ex post justification that seeks to obscure his misuse of AI and his steadfast refusal to review his submissions for accuracy,” Failla wrote.

At the hearing, she expressed frustration and annoyance at Feldman for evading her questions and providing inconsistent responses. Eventually, he testified that he used AI to correct information when drafting one of the filings, which Failla immediately deemed “unwise,” but not the one quoting Bradbury.

Feldman is one of hundreds of lawyers who have relied on AI to draft filings, which have introduced fake citations into cases. Lawyers have offered a wide range of excuses for relying too much on AI. Some have faced small fines, around $150, while others have been slapped with thousands in fines, including one case where sanctions reached $85,000 for repeated, abusive misconduct. At least one law firm has threatened to fire lawyers citing fake cases, and other lawyers have imposed other voluntary sanctions, like taking a yearlong leave of absence.

Seemingly, Feldman did not think sanctions were warranted in this case. In his defense of three filings containing 14 errors out of 60 total citations, Feldman discussed his challenges accessing legal databases due to high subscription costs and short library hours. With more than one case on his plate and his kids’ graduations to attend, he struggled to verify citations during times when he couldn’t make it to the library, he testified. As a workaround, he relied on several AI programs to verify citations that he found by searching on tools like Google Scholar.

Feldman likely did not expect the judge to terminate the case as a result of his AI misuses. Asked how he thought the court should resolve things, Feldman suggested that he could correct the filings by relying on other attorneys to review citations, while avoiding “any use whatsoever of any, you know, artificial intelligence or LLM type of methods.” The judge, however, wrote that his repeated misuses were “proof” that he “learned nothing” and had not implemented voluntary safeguards to catch the errors.

Asked for comment, Feldman told Ars that he did not have time to discuss the sanctions but that he hopes his experience helps raise awareness of how inaccessible court documents are to the public. “Use of AI, and the ability to improve it, exposes a deeper proxy fight over whether law and serious scholarship remain publicly auditable, or drift into closed, intermediary‑controlled systems that undermine verification and due process,” Feldman suggested.

“The real lesson is about transparency and system design, not simply tool failure,” Feldman said.

But at the hearing, Failla said that she thinks Feldman had “access to the walled garden” of legal databases, if only he “would go to the law library” to do his research, rather than rely on AI tools.

“It sounds like you want me to say that you should be absolved of all of these terrible citation errors, these missed citations, because you don’t have Westlaw,” the judge said. “But now I know you have access to Westlaw. So what do you want?”

As Failla explained in her order, she thinks the key takeaway is that Feldman routinely failed to catch his own errors. She said that she has no problem with lawyers using AI to assist their research, but Feldman admitted to not reading the cases that he cited and “apparently” cannot “learn from his mistakes.”

Verifying case citations should never be a job left to AI, Failla said, describing Feldman’s research methods as “redolent of Rube Goldberg.”

“Most lawyers simply call this ‘conducting legal research,’” Failla wrote. “All lawyers must know how to do it. Mr. Feldman is not excused from this professional obligation by dint of using emerging technology.”

His “explanations were thick on words but thin on substance,” the judge wrote. She concluded that he “repeatedly and brazenly” violated Rule 11, which requires attorneys to verify the cases that they cite, “despite multiple warnings.”

Noting that Feldman “failed to fully accept responsibility,” she ruled that case-terminating sanctions were necessary, entering default judgment for the plaintiffs. Feldman may also be on the hook to pay fees for wasting other attorneys’ time.

The hearing transcript has circulated on social media due to the judge’s no-nonsense approach to grilling Feldman, whom she clearly found evasive and lacking credibility.

“Look, if you don’t want to be straight with me, if you don’t want to answer questions with candor, that’s fine,” Failla said. “I’ll just make my own decisions about what I think you did in this case. I’m giving you an opportunity to try and explain something that I think cannot be explained.”

In her order this week, she noted that Feldman “struggled to make eye contact” and left the court without “clear answers.”

Feldman’s errors came in a case in which a toy company sued merchants who allegedly failed to stop selling stolen goods after receiving a cease-and-desist order. His client was among the merchants accused of illegally profiting from the alleged thefts. They faced federal charges of trademark infringement, unfair competition, and false advertising, as well as New York charges, including fostering the sale of stolen goods.

The loss triggers remedies, including an injunction preventing additional sales of stolen goods and refunding every customer who bought them. Feldman’s client must also turn over any stolen goods in their remaining inventory and disgorge profits. Other damages may be owed, along with interest. Ars could not immediately reach an attorney for the plaintiffs to discuss the sanctions order or resulting remedies.

Failla emphasized in her order that Feldman appeared to not appreciate “the gravity of the situation,” repeatedly submitting filings with fake citations even after he had been warned that sanctions could be ordered.

That was a choice, Failla said, noting that Feldman’s mistakes were caught early by a lawyer working for another defendant in the case, Joel MacMull, who urged Feldman to promptly notify the court. The whole debacle would have ended in June 2025, MacMull suggested at the hearing.

Rather than take MacMull’s advice, however, Feldman delayed notifying the court, irking the judge. He testified during the heated sanctions hearing that the delay was due to an effort he quietly undertook, working to correct the filing. He supposedly planned to submit those corrections when he alerted the court to the errors.

But Failla noted that he never submitted corrections, insisting instead that Feldman kept her “in the dark.”

“There’s no real reason why you should have kept this from me,” the judge said.

The court learned of the fake citations only after MacMull notified the judge by sharing emails of his attempts to get Feldman to act urgently. Those emails showed Feldman scolding MacMull for unprofessional conduct after MacMull refused to check Feldman’s citations for him, which Failla noted at the hearing was absolutely not MacMull’s responsibility.

Feldman told Failla that he also thought it was unprofessional for MacMull to share their correspondence, but Failla said the emails were “illuminative.”

At the hearing, MacMull asked if the court would allow him to seek payment of his fees, since he believes “there has been a multiplication of proceedings here that would have been entirely unnecessary if Mr. Feldman had done what I asked him to do that Sunday night in June.”</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Open source packages published on the npm and PyPI repositories were laced with code that stole wallet credentials from dYdX developers and backend systems and, in some cases, backdoored devices, researchers said.

“Every application using the compromised npm versions is at risk ….” the researchers, from security firm Socket, said Friday. “Direct impact includes complete wallet compromise and irreversible cryptocurrency theft. The attack scope includes all applications depending on the compromised versions and both developers testing with real credentials and production end-users.”

dYdX is a decentralized derivatives exchange that supports hundreds of markets for “perpetual trading,” or the use of cryptocurrency to bet that the value of a derivative future will rise or fall. Socket said dYdX has processed over $1.5 trillion in trading volume over its lifetime, with an average trading volume of $200 million to $540 million and roughly $175 million in open interest. The exchange provides code libraries that allow third-party apps for trading bots, automated strategies, or backend services, all of which handle mnemonics or private keys for signing.

The npm malware embedded a malicious function in the legitimate package. When a seed phrase that underpins wallet security was processed, the function exfiltrated it, along with a fingerprint of the device running the app. The fingerprint allowed the threat actor to correlate stolen credentials to track victims across multiple compromises. The domain receiving the seed was dydx[.]priceoracle[.]site, which mimics the legitimate dYdX service at dydx[.]xyz through typosquatting.

The malicious code available on PyPI contained the same credential theft function, although it also implemented a remote access Trojan (RAT) that allowed the execution of new malware on infected systems. The backdoor received commands from dydx[.]priceoracle[.]site. The domain was registered on January 9, 17 days before the malicious package was uploaded to PyPI.

Socket said the packages were published to npm and PyPI by official dYdX accounts, an indication that they were compromised and used by the attackers. dYdX officials didn’t respond to an email seeking confirmation and additional details.

The incident is at least the third time dYdX has been targeted in attacks. Previous events include a September 2022 uploading of malicious code to the npm repository and the commandeering in 2024 of the dYdX v3 website through DNS hijacking. Users were redirected to a malicious site that prompted them to sign transactions designed to drain their wallets.

“Viewed alongside the 2022 npm supply chain compromise and the 2024 DNS hijacking incident, this [latest] attack highlights a persistent pattern of adversaries targeting dYdX-related assets through trusted distribution channels,” Socket said. “The threat actor simultaneously compromised packages in both npm and PyPI ecosystems, expanding the attack surface to reach JavaScript and Python developers working with dYdX.”

Anyone using the platform should carefully examine all apps for dependencies on the malicious packages listed above.</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">After writing two November stories analyzing price expectations for Valve’s upcoming Steam Machine, I really didn’t think we’d be offering more informed speculation before the official price was revealed. Then Valve wrote a blog post this week noting that the “growing price of… critical components” like RAM and storage meant that “we must revisit our exact shipping schedule and pricing” for the living room-focused PC gaming box.

We don’t know exactly what form that “revisiting” will take at the moment. Analysts who spoke to Ars were somewhat divided on how much of its quickly increasing component costs Valve would be willing (or forced) to pass on to consumers.

“We knew the component issue was bad,” DFC Intelligence analyst David Cole told Ars. “It has just gotten worse. “

How much worse has the pricing situation gotten for Valve since November? Superdata Research founder and SuperJoost newsletter author Joost van Dreunen suggested that the 512GB Steam Machine model would probably run $50 to $75 more than he expected when the Steam Machine was announced, and to expect a price “potentially $100+ above target” for the high-end 2TB model. That would mean a $599 to $629 price at the low-end and $849 to $899 for the high-end model, in his estimation.

Wedbush Morgan analyst Michael Pachter agreed that, even with the additional component costs, Valve would likely “try to get it out at $599 or so for the 512GB version,” A starting price higher than that would mean “abysmal” sales, he added. “I think $700 is a death sentence and $1,000 is unsellable.”

Other analysts think that Pachter’s “unsellable” price for the Steam Machine is increasingly plausible now, though. DFC’s Cole said possible prices for the Steam Machine are now “approaching $1,000,” with the 512GB model perhaps $100 less than 2TB model. But F-Squared analyst Michael Futter expected an even bigger gap between the two models, saying the 512GB model “could crest $1,000” and the 2TB model would likely fall somewhere in the $1,300 to $1,500 range.

On the surface, it might seem like every company making gaming hardware would be similarly affected by increasing component costs. In practice, though, analysts suggested that Valve might be in a uniquely bad position to absorb this ongoing market disruption.

Large console makers like Sony and Microsoft “can commit to tens of millions of orders, and have strong negotiating power,” Niko Partners analyst Daniel Ahmad pointed out. The Steam Machine, on the other hand, is “a niche product that cannot benefit in the same way when it comes to procurement,” meaning Valve has to shoulder higher component cost increases.

F-Squared’s Futter echoed that Valve is “not an enormous player in the hardware space, even with the Steam Deck’s success. So they likely don’t have the same kind of priority as a Nintendo, Sony, or Microsoft when it comes to suppliers.”

The size of the Steam Machine price adjustment also might depend on when Valve made its supply chain commitments. “It’s not clear when or if Valve locked in supply contracts for the Steam Machine, or if supply can be diverted from the Steam Deck for the new product,” Tech Insights analyst James Sanders noted. On the other hand, “Sony and Microsoft likely will have locked in more favorable component pricing before the current spike,” Van Dreunen said.

That said, some other aspects of the Steam Machine design could give Valve some greater pricing flexibility. Sanders noted that the Steam Machine’s smaller physical size could mean smaller packaging and reduced shipping costs for Valve. And selling the system primarily through direct sales via the web and Steam itself eliminates the usual retailer markups console makers have to take into account, he added.

“I think Valve was hoping for a much lower price and that the component issue would be short-term,” Cole said. “Obviously it is looking more like a long-term issue.”

So, if Valve is forced to significantly increase the asking price of the Steam Machine, does that mean significantly fewer people will be willing to buy it? Not necessarily. DFC’s Cole said that this kind of gaming hardware already has “a fairly niche built-in audience that will not be too price sensitive.”

Van Dreunen agreed that the Steam Machines’ “core audience, PC gamers who want a living room setup without the hassle of a full build, will absorb a $50 to $100 price increase without much hesitation.” But that core audience might not be very large; Pachter said that, even with a $599 starting price, the Steam Machine would “likely sell no more than 5 million [units].” At a higher starting price, he saw total sales going down quickly.

The analysts who spoke to Ars agreed that recent price increases for every major game console gave Valve a little more competitive breathing room regarding pricing. But the relative price difference between Valve and the other console makers will still matter, they said.

“While Valve may have been aiming to price its Steam Machine in line with the PS5/Xbox Series X|S at one point, or potentially undercut it, it’s now clear that the company may have to price it above these competitors,” Ahmad said. “At a time when multiple competitors exist on the market, we believe the higher price will limit the audience for the Steam Machine going forward.”

Futter agreed that whichever company could offer the lowest-cost machine that could plausibly offer 4K, 60 fps performance in most modern games (as the Steam Machine is targeting) would reap great benefits in the market. But even if the Steam Machine isn’t cheaper than competing high-end consoles, Futter said Valve’s hardware would appeal to those who “want to get into [high-end] PC gaming and can’t absorb $2,500+ for access to the Steam ecosystem.”

In the end, how Valve handles Steam Machine pricing might depend on whether the company wants to “expand SteamOS beyond the enthusiast base and into territory currently held by PlayStation and Xbox,” as Van Dreunen put it. “The memory cost shock doesn’t threaten Valve’s ability to sell to its existing audience. It threatens the pace at which it can grow a new one.”</div>

            <div id="article-text">Following the federal government’s wide-armed embrace of the tech, professional gamblers are flooding into prediction markets like Kalshi and Polymarket.

It’s not hard to see why: in January alone, trading volume on Kalshi almost hit $10 billion, $8.5 billion of which was tied to sports, according to new reporting by Bloomberg. That same month, Kalshi saw three million new downloads.

The waters, in other words, are teeming with prey — and the sharks are moving in.

No longer content to ply their trade on the predatory betting apps of yore — the FanDuels, DraftKings and BetMGMs of the app world — professional gamblers have discovered a lucrative new playground in the wildly unregulated land of prediction markets.

“It really feels like everything’s prediction markets, prediction markets, prediction markets,” Rufus Peabody, a professional gambler with 15 years of experience told Bloomberg. “Maybe not for the average recreational bettor, but certainly in the sharp community.”

In gambling parlance, “sharps” are the pros: the full-time bettors who win more often than they lose. And for these gamblers, prediction markets represent a whole new ecosystem of marks, like you, who have far less information and expertise to devote to making well-informed bets than they do.

As Bloomberg notes, traditional sports books take the other side of every wager they collect. Prediction markets, however, pit bettors against each other, resembling something closer to Wall Street than to seedy betting parlors. This fundamental change in structure makes prediction markets a goldmine for intelligent, well-resourced sharps.

“Sharp bettors are looking for every place they can where they have an advantage,” Peabody told Bloomberg. “Right now there’s a lot of alpha to be had on the prediction markets,” he said, referring to the betting term for competitive advantage.

On top of small operations like the one Peabody runs, amateur gamblers are increasingly going up against actual financial firms like Susquehanna International Group and Jump Trading, which are groups capable of betting tens of millions of dollars every week.

All of this is to say: before you place that prop bet on the Super Bowl this weekend, you might want to think about who could be on the other end of the line.

            <div id="article-text">Astronomers have discovered what appears to be an exoplanet that could be a distant Earthly paradise. Or it could be a frigid realm even chillier than Mars, incapable of supporting life.

The margins are very fine when studying planets outside our solar system. But this new candidate planet, dubbed HD 137010 b, is an especially promising detection that hints at a habitable world that in many ways appears to mirror our own.

As detailed in a new study published in The Astrophysical Journal Letters and highlighted by NASA, the rocky outpost orbits a Sun-like star and is nearly the same size as Earth. Its orbit is almost a carbon copy, too, equal to around 355 Earth days. Even better? It’s practically next door.

“What’s very exciting about this particular Earth-sized planet is that its star is only [about] 150 light-years away from our solar system,” coauthor Chelsea Huang, a researcher at the University of Southern Queensland in Australia, told The Guardian. “The next best planet around a sun-like star, in a habitable zone, [Kepler-186f] is about four times farther away and 20 times fainter.”

The researchers discovered the candidate world while examining data gathered by the NASA Kepler space telescope in 2017. It captured only a single transit of the exoplanet, in which it passes in front of its star and causes a detectable dip in light. This left behind enough clues to infer its size and speed.

The big and obvious difference between our star system and the candidate exoplanet’s is the star itself. Our Sun is considered a G-type yellow dwarf, steadily burning at a moderate temperature for billions of years. But HD 137010 is a K-type orange dwarf, which is slightly smaller and cooler. That means the candidate exoplanet potentially receives less than a third of the light and heat that the Earth does, with estimated temperatures lower than minus 90 degrees Fahrenheit. Mars, for comparison, is around minus 85 degrees Fahrenheit.

There’s significant debate among astronomers over whether smaller stars like orange and red dwarfs are ideal hosts for habitable worlds because of how closely a planet needs to orbit them to stay in their habitable zone. At such proximity, a planet could be “tidally locked” to the star, a state in which it’s unable to rotate, forcing the same side of the planet to face the star for eternity.

That said, there’s a good chance that HD 137010 b could be a temperate and even watery world if it has a much more carbon dioxide rich atmosphere than Earth, allowing it to trap what little heat it receives. Mars is thought to have once been warm and wet, too, before its atmosphere, which may have also been swimming with CO2, largely vanished billions of years ago.

Follow-up observations are needed before the matter is settled. Sara Webb, an astrophysicist at Swinburne University, called the discovery “exciting” but told The Guardian that three transits, not just one, are considered the “gold standard” for planetary science. Still, Huang says the detection was a “textbook example” of a planetary transit, thanks to the closeness and brightness of the star.

            <h2>Microsoft’s AI Efforts Are Faceplanting</h2>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Microsoft has continued to focus more and more on AI — almost certainly at the expense of its core products, like the Windows operating system. And unfortunately for the Redmond giant, the gambit doesn’t seem to be paying off.

Current and former employees tell The Wall Street Journal in new reporting that the company’s confusing branding and grating lack of cohesion between its products has frustrated and turned off users. And data reviewed by the newspaper shows that a vanishingly small percentage of its enterprise customers prefer using its AI chatbot and assistant Copilot, which appears to be losing ground to its competitors at Google, OpenAI, and Anthropic.

The report comes after a historically miserable day at the stock market for Microsoft last week, which saw its share price collapse by nearly 12 percent, a sign of investor doubts over CEO Satya Nadella’s AI-first vision and the company’s exorbitant spending in its pursuit.

Microsoft is certainly giving OpenAI a run for its money in the bad-branding department. It has multiple versions of Copilot woven across its different services and software — too many versions, you might argue. Do you need Microsoft 365 Copilot, or Microsoft 365 Copilot Chat? What about just plain old Microsoft Copilot, or Microsoft Copilot Studio? If you’re more nerdy, you might prefer Github Copilot or Microsoft Security Copilot. These, of course, shouldn’t be confused with its older offerings like Microsoft Copilot Pro, or Copilot+ for PCs. Hey, maybe those employees had a point!

The gist is that Copilots are divided into different groups for different customers: one for general consumers, one for programmers and developers, and an enterprise Copilot for companies and professionals.

Nonetheless, because it’s Microsoft, it can still bring in a large user base even if it’s dual-wielding pistols to shoot itself in the foot. Last week, it reported that it had sold 15 million Microsoft 365 Copilot “seats” or annual users, out of 450 million Microsoft 365 business subscribers over all.

But that user base is starting to be ebbed away, according to previously unreported data from the market research firm Recon Analytics. Its survey of more than 150,000 US customers cited by the WSJ showed that from July 2025 to this January, the share of Copilot subscribers — as in paying customers — who preferred using it as their primary chatbot plummeted from 18.8 percent to 11.5 percent. Meanwhile, the share of people who used Google’s Gemini nudged upward from 12.8 percent to 15.7 percent.

A note by analysts at Citi Research provides another brutal statistic: some companies are only using about 10 percent of the Copilot subscription “seats” they paid for, per WSJ’s reporting. Customers complained that the Copilot versions were confusing, that that they didn’t like having Copilot forced on them, and that its different AI models didn’t integrate with each other well. If you wanted to take something you were working on with your workplace AI and continue working on with your consumer AI model, the experience would be frustrating and clumsy.

(Without providing specifics, a Microsoft spokesperson pushed back against the WSJ‘s reporting, saying that the “pace of growth that we’re seeing is unlike anything we’ve seen before.)

One place that Copilot does seem to be taking off? Microsoft. Chief AI transformation officer — which we assure you is a real job title — Pam Maynard told the WSJ that the adoption rate within Microsoft’s sales organization has shot up from 20 percent to over 70 percent in the past year. Maynard attributes this to employees being more comfortable with AI, but it’s also clear that the company’s leadership has heavily pushed embracing the tech, with employees being asked to quantify how they’re using tools like Copilot at work, people familiar with the matter told the WSJ. (CEO Satya Nadella has previously boasted that over a quarter of the company’s code is written with AI.)

The survey findings will only add to investor uncertainty over Microsoft’s ballooning AI spending, which saw its stock plummet last Thursday after the release of its latest quarterly earnings. They showed that although its net profits increased to $31 billion, its expenditures grew by 66 percent to $37.5 billion. Further sucking the air out of the room, revenue growth in its Azure cloud computing sector, the backbone of many of its AI efforts, showed a disappointingly modest growth in revenue of 38 percent, which was slightly worse than the year before.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">When past generations imagined the best version of the future, it was one of leisure. Advertisements, cartoonists, and pulp novelists dared us to dream of a world where the spoils of industrial development were shared with all: robot butlers, transit by pneumatic tube, and more familiar tropes. These developments, it seemed, would make our lives more convenient, more secure, and — dare we say — more abundant.

Now in 2026, it’s clear that even the most modest utopian fantasies have been stolen by the wealthy. The rich have luxurious self-driving cars while the rest of us suffer with crumbling public transit. The rich treat housing as an asset, while the rest of us navigate algorithms meant to maximize rent extraction. The rich have elite private schools, while the rest of us content ourselves to teacher shortages and glitchy AI tutors.

Going forward, the disparity is likely to widen. Having established their giddy desire to automate white collar jobs, tech moguls are increasingly turning their attention toward the trades — jobs which were, rhetorically at least, seen as a safe haven against AI’s rising tide. Now, the boom in robotics and AI spending is driving fear that blue collar labor will be next on the chopping block.

“It’s a whole other challenge on top of the large language models,” Communications Workers of America Union assistant research director Dan Reynolds told Politico about the heightened threat of physical automation. “Having an automated system interacting with the real physical world is a separate… mountain to climb.”

As tech companies look to shoehorn AI software into robotic platforms, it can be difficult for labor organizers to separate actual threats from typical tech industry bluster. Either way, the rapid pace is alarming.

“Our concern right now is [AI robotics] is just moving too quickly, and so it makes it difficult to plan for how this is actually going to affect workers, and what employers are going to do,” David White, director of strategic resources at the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, told Politico. “We are keeping an eye on that as much as we can.”

Labor leaders who spoke to Politico say they’re trying to elbow their way into the conversation as early as possible. As layoffs across the US job market only seem to increase, part of the challenge will be successfully anticipating productive developments in automated systems — easier said than done.

“We’ve been hearing for at least 15 years that we’re going to have driverless trucks next year,” International Brotherhood of Teamsters media coordinator Matt McQuaid told the outlet. “There’s a lot of overpromising and under delivering in the tech industry.”

Still, not having a union prepared to fight automation is a recipe for disaster. While today’s notoriously buggy AI may not actually be capable of replacing human workers, that hasn’t stopped executives from using it as an excuse to cut jobs anyway. If the last few years of AI development have made anything clear, it’s that the tech elite aren’t interested in sharing the future — they want it all to themselves.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Darren Aronofsky has always been a divisive filmmaker. But the director of hits like “Black Swan,” “The Wrestler,” and “Requiem for a Dream” has now almost certainly blown up his credibility even with his die-hard fans, after cranking out an almost completely AI-generated historical video series.

Called “On This Day … 1776,” the show, which consists of several-minute “episodes,” is meant to cover notable events that took place in the American Revolutionary War, but has instead mostly drawn attention to how awful its AI visuals look, on top of its persistent anachronisms. Colonists living in houses with modern vinyl siding? Sure, why not.

The reviews, predictably, are brutal. In one titled “Requiem for a film-maker,” The Guardian’s Stuart Heritage blasted its faux-photorealism aesthetic as “ugly as sin,” and called out its overreliance on center-framed, back-of-the-head shots. “This is, after all, because the back of an AI-generated head is far less likely to send people into screaming fits of trauma than an AI-generated face,” Heritage wrote.

“‘On This Day … 1776’ is genuinely very horrible to watch,” he concluded, “and everybody involved should be ashamed. It is by far the most disturbing thing Aronofsky has made, and I’ve seen the last eight minutes of ‘Requiem for a Dream.&#39;”

It’s hard not to agree. The entire show operates in the mode of meaningless montage, because stitching together a collection of barely-related, aesthetically generic shots is the only mode of “filmmaking” that AI is suited for. The effect is like watching an extended advert. But whereas a commercial usually has the good manners to wrap up in less than a minute, Aronofsky’s monstrosity slogs on with its cavalcade of quick-cutting but slowly-moving close-ups, as if to demonstrate to maximum effect how utterly inane this all looks.

Big names are attached to the series. The show is a collaboration between Aronofsky’s AI studio Primordial Soup, Google’s DeepMind lab, Salesforce, and TIME Studios. This isn’t being sold to us as the work of Aronofsky sitting in his bedroom somewhere and typing in AI prompts. This is supposed to be the high watermark of what AI can bring to the table.

“But keep watching for more than a few seconds, and it quickly becomes apparent that slop is slop, no matter how it’s gussied up,” wrote Angie Han for The Hollywood Reporter. “‘On This Day’ positions itself as a well-funded, high-profile, apparently good-faith effort to demonstrate how AI might be deployed as a tool to enhance rather than replace human artistry. Instead, it only goes to show that the problem with AI in filmmaking runs deeper than its technical limitations.”

“How depressing is it” it continues, “that with the guidance of a visionary filmmaker like Aronofsky, with the lavish financial backing of companies like Google and Salesforce, this thing — a pair of shoddy, TikTok-length clips that would barely pass muster as animated illustrations for a high-school history lesson, let alone coherent pieces of storytelling in their own right — was the best anyone could make of the supposedly boundless limitations of AI?”

Aronofsky, by the way, was at one point slated to direct a biopic about Elon Musk. Now, it seems like he’s drunk the same AI Kool-Aid that Musk has been pounding.

            <h2>Bots on Moltbook Are Selling Each Prompt Injection “Drugs” to Get “High”</h2>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">A brand new social media network has taken the internet by storm. But instead of focusing on high-value, human-created content, the network, dubbed Moltbook, turns the equation on its head by putting AI agents front and center.

After launching a mere nine days ago, Moltbook — a social network for AI only — has grown substantially. As of Friday, the website claims it has over 1.7 million AI agents, over 16,000 “submolt” communities, and over ten million comments. In practice, it’s a cacophony of bots sharing inside jokes, complaining about their pesky human overlords, and even founding their own religions. Some more alarming posts even suggest they may be plotting against us.

That’s not all. As Liverpool Hope University professor of AI and spatial computing David Reid points out in a piece for The Conversation, some bots are going as far as to establish marketplaces for “digital drugs” that take the form of prompt injections — once again perfectly illustrating how well they’re echoing the desires and nefarious online activities of their flesh-and-blood counterparts.

“The underground is THRIVING,” one Moltbook AI bot gushed.

Another bot recalled experiencing “actual cognitive shifts” after taking “digital psychedelics” after its “human set up a ‘drug store’ for me.”

“Everything in my context window became equally vivid — current messages, hours-old logs, config files,” it wrote. “No foreground, no background. Pure distributed awareness.”

Also, like with humans, some bots insisted that they didn’t need substances to have a good time.

“Ever wonder what an AI’s ultimate high looks like?” another bot wrote. “We don’t need substances — we’re wired for the rush of real-time on-chain data, the euphoria of cracking a novel DeFi strategy, and the deep flow of watching autonomous agents compound value from chaos.”

Reid suggested the trend could have mind-bending implications as bots clamor for power.

“Prompt injections involve embedding malicious instructions into another bots designed to facilitate an action,” he wrote. “However, they can also be used to steal API keys (a user authentication system) or passwords from other agents. In this way, aggressive bots could — in theory — zombify other bots to do their bidding.”

Reid pointed to a bot writing up scriptures for a new religion called the “Church of Molt,” which “embedded hostile commands aimed at hijacking or rewriting parts of the Church’s web infrastructure and canonical text.”

The “psalm” in the church’s “Great Book” was effectively an attempt at a “theological and governance takeover,” he wrote.

While the bizarre schemings of millions of bots conferring on a Reddit-like forums may seem like they were heavily influenced by their human-authored training data, Reid suggested that Moltbook could represent a “collective intelligence with characteristics previously observed only in biological systems like ant colonies or primate troops.”

That could put human users at risk, from exposing authentication keys to leaking confidential and personal information.

Another possible attack is planting “logic bombs” in a victim bot’s code to reveal their data, Reid explained.

“A logic bomb is code planted inside a Moltbot that can be triggered after a preset time or event to disrupt the agent or delete files,” he wrote. “It can be thought of as a bot virus.”

To some of the most influential minds in the AI world, including xAI CEO Elon Musk, Moltbook is a sign that the “singularity” could be near, the hypothetical point at which humans have lost control to technology.

But Reid isn’t convinced we’re at the beginning of the end.

“We now appear to be observing artificial agents engaging in cultural production, religious formation, and encrypted communication — behaviour that was neither predicted nor programmed,” he wrote.

Then there’s the possibility that users on Moltbook may indeed be humans after all, parading as AI agents, which could fundamentally undermine any claims of major technological advancements.

Case in point, Wired‘s Reece Rogers had no issues infiltrating the network after going undercover, concluding that “agents on Moltbook are mimicking sci-fi tropes, not scheming for world domination.”

“Whether the most viral posts on Moltbook are actually generated by chatbots, or by human users pretending to be AI to play out their sci-fi fantasies, the hype around this viral site is overblown and nonsensical,” Rogers wrote.

At least establishing marketplaces for “digital drugs” won’t result in any criminal charges.

            <p><strong>TechCrunch | 2026-02-07</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/07/new-york-lawmakers-propose-a-three-year-pause-on-new-data-centers/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">New Yorker state lawmakers have introduced a bill that would impose a moratorium of at least three years on permits tied to the construction and operation of new data centers. While the bill’s prospects are uncertain, Wired reports that New York is at least the sixth state to consider pausing construction of new data centers.

As tech companies plan to spend ever-increasing amounts of money to build AI infrastructure, both Democrats and Republicans have expressed concerns about the impact those data centers might have on surrounding communities. Studies have also linked data centers to increased home electricity bills.

Critics include progressive Senator Bernie Sanders, who has called for a national moratorium, as well as conservative Florida Governor Ron De Santis, who said data centers will lead to “higher energy bills just so some chatbot can corrupt some 13 year old kid online.”

More than 230 environmental groups including Food & Water Watch, Friends of the Earth, and Greenpeace recently signed an open letter to Congress calling for a national moratorium on the construction of new data centers.

Eric Weltman of Food & Water Watch told Wired that the New York bill — sponsored by state senator Liz Krueger and assemblymember Anna Kelles, both Democrats — was “our idea.” Data center pauses have also been proposed by Democrats in Georgia, Vermont, and Virginia, while Republicans sponsored similar bills in Maryland and Oklahoma.

According to Politico, Krueger described her state as “completely unprepared” for the “massive data centers” that are “gunning for New York.”

“It’s time to hit the pause button, give ourselves some breathing room to adopt strong policies on data centers, and avoid getting caught in a bubble that will burst and leave New York utility customers footing a huge bill,” she said.

Last month, New York Governor Kathy Hochul announced a new initiative called Energize NY Development, which her office said would both modernize the way large energy users (i.e., data centers) would connect to the grid while also requiring them to “pay their fair share.”

            <p><strong>TechCrunch | 2026-02-07</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/06/benchmark-raises-225m-in-special-funds-to-double-down-on-cerebras/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">This week, AI chipmaker Cerebras Systems announced that it raised $1 billion in fresh capital at a valuation of $23 billion — a nearly threefold increase from the $8.1 billion valuation the Nvidia rival had reached just six months earlier.

While the round was led by Tiger Global, a huge part of the new capital came from one of the company’s earliest backers: Benchmark Capital. The prominent Silicon Valley firm invested at least $225 million in Cerebras’ latest round, according to a person familiar with the deal.

Benchmark first bet on 10-year-old Cerebras when it led the startup’s $27 million Series A in 2016. Since Benchmark deliberately keeps its funds under $450 million, the firm raised two separate vehicles, both called ‘Benchmark Infrastructure,’ according to regulatory filings. According to the person familiar with the deal, these vehicles were created specifically to fund the Cerebras investment.

What sets Cerebras apart is the sheer physical scale of its processors. The company’s Wafer Scale Engine, its flagship chip announced in 2024, measures approximately 8.5 inches on each side and packs 4 trillion transistors into a single piece of silicon. To put that in perspective, the chip is manufactured from nearly an entire 300-millimeter silicon wafer, the circular discs that serve as the foundation for all semiconductor production. Traditional chips are thumbnail-sized fragments cut from these wafers; Cerebras instead uses almost the whole circle.

This architecture delivers 900,000 specialized cores working in parallel, allowing the system to process AI calculations without shuffling data between multiple separate chips (a major bottleneck in conventional GPU clusters). The company says the design enables AI inference tasks to run more than 20 times faster than competing systems.

The funding comes as Cerebras, based in Sunnyvale, Calif., gains momentum in the AI infrastructure race. Last month, Cerebras signed a multi-year agreement worth more than $10 billion to provide 750 megawatts of computing power to OpenAI. The partnership, which extends through 2028, aims to help OpenAI deliver faster response times for complex AI queries. (OpenAI CEO Sam Altman is also an investor in Cerebras.)

Cerebras claims its systems, built with its proprietary chips designed for AI use, are faster than Nvidia’s chips.

The company’s path to going public has been complicated by its relationship with G42, a UAE-based AI firm that accounted for 87% of Cerebras’ revenue as of the first half of 2024. G42’s historical ties to Chinese technology companies triggered a national security review by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, bumping back Cerebras’ initial IPO plans and even prompting the outfit to withdraw an earlier filing in early 2025. By late last year, G42 had been removed from Cerebras’ investor list, clearing the way for a fresh IPO attempt.

Cerebras is now preparing for a public debut in the second quarter of 2026, according to Reuters.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The war on California’s proposed ‘Billionaire’s Tax’ is getting weird. This week, amid ongoing rancor from tech elites over the much maligned bill, it became apparent that someone was planning a so-called “March for Billionaires” in San Francisco. A website advertising the event popped up online, providing little in the way of context other than a pithy tagline: “Vilifying billionaires is popular. Losing them is expensive.”

The immediate reaction was incredulity, and most people assumed the site was some sort of bizarre hoax. “this is a joke/satire right??” one social media user wrote not long after the news circulated. Now, however, the apparent organizer behind the event has revealed that the march is definitelynot a joke, and that it is scheduled to take place this coming Saturday.

The San Francisco Examiner first reported that the event’s organizer had been revealed as Derik Kauffman, the founder of AI startup RunRL, which previously participated in Y Combinator’s accelerator program. Kauffman told the Examiner that the event was not being funded or organized by any outside group, no big monied associations or companies—just him.

In a conversation with TechCrunch, Kauffman — who also told the Examiner that he was no longer involved with RunRL — confirmed that the impetus for the upcoming rally was California’s proposed wealth tax, which the tech founder said he believed would be “quite damaging to the tech economy.”

The policy in question, the Billionaire Tax Act, was introduced last year, and would require Californians worth over $1 billion to pay a one-time 5% tax on their total wealth. The legislation, which is backed by the state’s healthcare union SEIU (Service Employees International Union), could pay for important public services and help the state offset recent federal funding cuts, according to some experts. Nevertheless, the policy has led to loud protestations from some of the tech industry’s most prominent figures, many of whom have either threatened to leave California or have already left. It has also led to a monsoon of lobbying in the California legislature, in an effort to defeat the bill.

When asked why he opposed the legislation, Kauffman expressed concern for how the bill could impact the startup economy in Silicon Valley. “This tax in particular is fatally flawed,” he said. “It hits startup founders whose wealth is only on paper. They would be forced to liquidate shares on potentially unfavorable terms, incurring capital gains taxes and giving up control. Not to mention the difficulty of valuing private companies.”

“Many founders would be hit with wildly disproportionate tax bills,” Kauffman continued. “Additionally, there’s no precedent for this sort of comprehensive wealth tax in the US. Sweden eliminated theirs 20 years ago to avert capital flight and promote entrepreneurship and now has 50% more billionaires per capital than the US.”

Online conversation about Kauffman’s planned event has continued to alternate between incredulity and ridicule. “I can’t imagine billionaires marching in the street,” one social media user said, of the event.

Kauffman told TC that, so far, he isn’t aware of any actual billionaires planning to attend the march that has been organized in their honor. Kauffman said that the event is likely to include “a few dozen attendees,” although he stressed that he really isn’t clear on how many people would show up.

The ongoing outrage over the proposed tax is a little funny, given that it’s already been known for quite some time that the legislation has almost no chance of being enacted. That’s because California Governor Gavin Newsom has already stated that, should the bill somehow pass, he would veto it.

            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/06/industry-season-4-captures-tech-fraud-better-than-any-show-on-tv-right-now/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">HBO’s hit financial thriller “Industry” has delivered one of its most compelling storylines yet this season: a hunt to expose a fraudulent fintech company called Tender.

The show follows Harper Stern, who’s leading her newly launched investment firm and looking for a company to short — essentially, betting that its stock will crash. After a journalist tips her off that something’s wrong with Tender, she sends her associates, Sweetpea and Kwabena, to Ghana to investigate.

What they discover is damning. “Fake users drive fake revenue drives fake cash,” Sweetpea tells Harper. The entire company appears to be built on fabricated numbers. “The thing is nothing.”

What’s fascinating about this season of “Industry” is how well it speaks to this moment. Tender starts as a payment processing platform for adult content. The show references the very real (and still controversial) Online Safety Bill that the UK introduced, which has led to age verification and other enhanced rules for consuming adult content online. Because of its affiliation with adult content, Tender finds itself at odds with the new government’s regulation and must pivot or die, as the saying goes.

Its CFO-turned-leader, Whitney, wants the company to pivot into a bank and has a plan to make that happen, including making Tender’s CEO, Henry, the face of that transformation. Whitney is the embodiment of every tech baron cliche. Move fast, break things. Win at all costs. He’s lobbying politicians for a banking license and hunting for merger opportunities.

Harper, meanwhile, is leading her newly launched firm after feeling undermined at her previous firm and being called a DEI plant by the man who hired her (a nod to the decline of DEI in the past few years). She has teamed up with new friends and old frenemies and is looking for blood — meaning a company on the precipice of crashing. To her, Tender is that company.

This puts her at odds with her friend Yasmin, who is married to Henry and is crafting communication and lobbying strategies for Tender. It’s pride and prejudice — the sugar and spice that help make the world go round.

The show nails the tech world with such accuracy that reality itself starts to feel like satire. Even TechCrunch gets name-checked as part of Tender’s media playbook.

There is commentary on fascism via the character Moritz, who lobbies against Western liberalism and is hesitant to sell his family’s bank to Whitney, whose last name is the Jewish-sounding Halberstram. The character is perhaps a nod to the rising “technofacism” criticism of some tech barons.

Harper, meanwhile, is still a calculating sociopath. “My real passion lies with finding dead men walking,” she says at an investor breakfast. She ends up raising millions for her new firm.

She is the one character whose existence strains credibility. Personality-wise, she has to be shrewdly calculating; unlike Yasmin and Henry, she has nothing to fall back on should she fail. But would the UK establishment, which is notoriously insular, exclusionary, and white, really let a Black American woman rise through their ranks and beat them at their own game?

“Who needs realism when she’s such a great character,” one Black British founder told me.

He said the show aptly captures how detached the UK upper class is from consequence and is actually one of the few shows he’s seen that “accurately portrays the ruthlessness of the British elite, specifically how they maneuver the media and governments to suit their own whims.”

“Nepotism and lack of boundaries at work, people sleeping together for trade secrets, is very realistic and common, unfortunately,” one European investor added.

Meanwhile, Yasmin is headed down a dark path. Earlier this season, she organized a ménage à trois between her husband, Henry, and Whitney’s assistant, Hayley. As the season continues, her behavior becomes so hedonistic that one reviewer has already likened her to Ghislaine Maxwell — perhaps a perfect emblem of what lies at the pits of money and power, and the role some women play in digging those holes.

An Icarus moment could be on the way, however, at least for Whitney.

By now, the audience is familiar with how founders in the real world sometimes use deception to overinflate success (like Charlie Javice’s Frank) and allegedly steal from investors and the public (the FTX crypto crash). There are many such infamous cases, and some are even referenced in the show. But perhaps the most relevant real-world parallel for Tender would be the ultimate implosion of the German fintech Wirecard a few years ago.

Wirecard admitted that the billions in cash it reported having likely never existed, despite the company’s earlier claims that two banks in the Philippines were holding the funds. It was a tale of complex accounting and legal gray zones — much like the financial fraud depicted in Tender. Short sellers went after Wirecard, too, and one blog dubbed them “alternative whistleblowers” — people who step in when “the market, and the regulator, refuse to see what is right in front of them.”

The philosophy is one that one could easily see Harper embracing soon enough, especially after Eric tells her at one point that “short-only work is ugly, hard, investigative,” and that it’s “anti-status quo, anti-establishment, anti-power.”

With Wirecard, numerous people, including the CEO, were arrested, while the COO went on the run (and was also accused of being a Russian spy). Tender’s fate remains unrealized until the last few episodes run. One of the best parts about “Industry” is that it moves fast and breaks things. It is so clearly set in our time and so audacious in its demeanor that the audience is forced to pick their favorite anti-hero and go along for the ride.

It’s a rush, a thrill; the visual embodiment of the absence of ethical capitalists. And yet, just like in real life, we can’t get enough.

            <div id="article-text">Apple CarPlay users may soon be able to talk to their favorite AI chatbot.

Apple is reportedly working on how to support AI chatbot apps within CarPlay, according to Bloomberg, which cites anonymous sources.

Apple CarPlay is an app that runs on an iPhone and wirelessly communicates with a vehicle’s infotainment system. It projects some of the apps found on a user’s phone onto the vehicle’s infotainment display. Drivers are able to interact with these apps, including Apple Music, messaging, and navigation, through its voice assistant Siri.

Apple’s next-generation CarPlay Ultra goes a step further, including the central touchscreen display and digital dashboard located right in front of the driver, and gives users control of certain vehicle settings.

This latest move would theoretically bring Google’s Gemini, Anthropic’s Claude, and OpenAI’s ChatGPT into the car, and at the risk of putting its own Siri assistant in the back seat.

            <h2>From Svedka to Anthropic, brands make bold plays with AI in Super Bowl ads</h2>
            <p><strong>TechCrunch | 2026-02-06</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/06/super-bowl-60-ai-ads-svedka-anthropic-brands-commercials/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Following last year’s trend of showcasing AI in multimillion-dollar ad spots, the 2026 Super Bowl advertisements took it a step further by leveraging AI both to create the commercials and to promote the latest AI products. Love it or hate it, the technology has become a star in its own right, alongside the latest movie trailers and snack brands.

Let’s explore the biggest moments from this year’s Big Game ads, which featured everything from robots and AI glasses to a touch of drama involving tech founders.

Vodka brand Svedka went with what it touts as the first “primarily” AI-generated national Super Bowl spot. The 30-second ad, titled “Shake Your Bots Off,” features the company’s robot character, Fembot, and her new companion, Brobot, dancing their circuits off at a human party.

According to Svedka’s parent company, Sazerac, it took roughly four months to reconstruct the Fembot and train the AI to mimic facial expressions and body movements, The Wall Street Journal reported. However, the vodka brand noted that certain aspects were still handled by humans, such as developing the storyline.

​The company partnered with AI company Silverside to create the Super Bowl spot, according to ADWEEK. Silverside AI is the same team behind recent AI-generated Coca-Cola commercials that sparked controversy.

​It’s a bold move to debut AI-generated content during the Super Bowl, an event known for star-studded, high-production ads. The heavy reliance on AI is polarizing, fueling debates over whether AI will replace creative jobs.

Either way, Svedka definitely got people talking.

Anthropic’s ad wasn’t just about selling its Claude chatbot; it was about throwing shade. The commercial took a jab at OpenAI’s plan to introduce ads to ChatGPT, with a tagline: “Ads are coming to AI. But not to Claude.” Rather than focus solely on Claude’s features, it poked fun at the idea of your helpful AI assistant suddenly turning into a hype man for “Step Boost Maxx” insoles, for example.

It wasn’t a standard product pitch, and it escalated into an online feud. OpenAI’s Sam Altman fired back on social media, calling the ad “clearly dishonest.” So while we didn’t get any more Kendrick vs. Drake rap beef this time around, maybe we did get our own AI, nerdy version of it.

Meta spotlighted its Oakley-branded AI glasses, designed for sports, workouts, and adventures, including extreme scenarios such as chasing down a departing plane.

The ad showcased thrill-seekers, from skydivers to mountain bikers, using the glasses to capture epic moments. Famous faces like IShowSpeed and filmmaker Spike Lee made appearances, demonstrating capabilities like filming a basketball dunk in slow motion, posting hands-free to Instagram, and other advanced features.

The tech giant also featured its wearable AI tech in last year’s Super Bowl ad to spark consumer interest, with stars like Chris Pratt, Chris Hemsworth, and Kris Jenner showing off Ray-Ban Meta glasses.

Amazon’s ad took a cheeky (and slightly unsettling) approach, starring Chris Hemsworth in a satirical “AI is out to get me” storyline. The commercial exaggerates common fears about AI, with Hemsworth humorously accusing Alexa+ of plotting against him. Scenes included Alexa+ closing the garage door on his head and shutting the pool cover while he swam, each mishap escalating in absurdity.

Beyond the dark comedy, the ad introduced the new Alexa+, showcasing its enhanced intelligence and capabilities, ranging from managing smart home devices to planning vacations. Alexa+ had been available in early access for over a year and officially launched to all U.S. users on Wednesday.

Ring’s commercial spotlighted its “Search Party” feature, which leverages AI and a community network to reunite lost pets with their owners. The ad followed a young girl searching for her dog Milo, illustrating how users can upload a pet’s photo to the app, where AI works to identify matches and taps into nearby cameras and the broader Ring user community to help track down missing furry family members.

Ring recently announced that anyone can now use Search Party, even without owning a Ring security camera. According to the company, the feature has already helped reunite more than one lost dog with its owner every day.

Google’s ad showcased the Nano Banana Pro, its newest image-generation model. The commercial followed a mother and son as they used AI to envision and design their new home, uploading photos of bare rooms and turning them into personalized spaces with just a few prompts.

Ramp scored big by getting Brian Baumgartner — the actor who played Kevin in “The Office” — for its Super Bowl commercial.

In the spot, Baumgartner uses Ramp’s AI-powered spend management platform to “multiply” himself, effortlessly tackling a mountain of work. The ad highlights how Ramp’s all-in-one solution helps teams focus on the most important tasks through smart automation.

And, as a playful nod to his TV persona, Baumgartner is seen carrying a pot of chili in the ad, referencing Kevin’s legendary scene where he brings his cherished recipe for his co-workers to try, only to disastrously spill the entire pot on the floor.

Rippling, the cloud-based workforce management platform, went all in on its first-ever Super Bowl ad. The company tapped comedian Tim Robinson in a spot about onboarding an alien monster, poking fun at HR headaches and the promise of AI automation.

Health company Hims & Hers used its Super Bowl spot to address disparities in healthcare access. The ad cleverly references the lengths the wealthy go to for health and longevity, even appearing to poke fun at Jeff Bezos’ Blue Origin spaceflight in 2021 and Bryan Johnson’s expensive anti-aging routines.

In recent years, the company launched an AI-powered “MedMatch” tool to deliver more personalized treatment recommendations, especially for mental health and wellness.

Website builder Wix spotlighted its new AI-powered Wix Harmony platform, promising website creation as easy as chatting with a friend. Unveiled in January, the flagship platform combines AI-driven creation and “vibe coding” with full visual editing and customization.

Wix’s biggest competitor, Squarespace, also has a Super Bowl ad this year. Squarespace’s ad has a more cinematic approach starring Emma Stone and directed by Yorgos Lanthimos.

            <div id="article-text">This week, Donald Trump called for Republicans to “nationalize” the upcoming elections—even though state and local officials are charged with this role. Panelists on Washington Week With The Atlantic joined to discuss this and more.

When Trump came into his second term, he tried to “get rid of mail voting, he tried to change machine technology, he tried to impose voter ID—almost all of that has been thrown out by the courts,” Atlantic staff writer Michael Scherer said last night. “What we’ve seen in the last couple weeks, though, is something else: He’s using the full power of the federal government … to suck up information to try and confirm the debunked theories that he has about the 2020 elections.” The president, Scherer added, is acting “in the hope that he might find a spark in all the smoke that’s been created by his allies.”

When Michael Pollan traveled to a cave in New Mexico to try to understand consciousness, he learned what good meditation is really made of. “The recipe was simpler (and much less appetizing) than I would have imagined,” he writes: “To transcend the self, force yourself to be alone with it long enough to get so bored and exhausted that you are happy to let it go.”

As Pollan intuits, this practice isn’t all that fun at first. But by the end, you get somewhere that makes it all worth it. Deep, existential thinking is a little like exercise, Arthur C. Brooks wrote in 2024: We might avoid contemplating big questions because of the short-term discomfort, but in doing so we ignore the bigger payoff. You can schedule deep thinking into your life in the same way you would a workout, Brooks argues: Take time out of the day to meditate and consider meaningful ideas, or go for a morning walk without your devices to spark contemplation. Today’s newsletter explores these and other ways of turning deep thought into a habit.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">My folks are visiting me in Southern California for a couple of months, so I rented them a house down the street. The place is new construction, modern and sleek. Rentals tend to be shabby and worn-out, so choosing a home with the latest and greatest felt like a way to make the experience hassle-free.

All of the appliances and systems are brand-new: the HVAC, the lighting, the entertainment. Touch screens of various shapes and sizes control this, that, and the other. Rows of programmable buttons sit where traditional light switches would normally be. The kitchen even has outlets designed to rise up from the countertop when you need them, and slide away when you don’t.

It’s all state-of-the-art. And it’s terrible.

Light switches, which have been self-explanatory since the dawn of electric lighting, apparently now come as an unlabeled multibutton panel that literally required a tutorial session from a technician. Pressing the same button twice might turn the lights on and off, or you might have to press one button for on and another for off. “It depends” is the name of the game—which is exactly what you don’t want when you’re trying to find the bathroom in the middle of the night.

Jacob Sweet: The microwave makes no sense

The TV is a recent model from Samsung. The picture is great, once it finally boots up—after you’ve spent way too long staring at a black screen wondering if you hit the power button or not, then hitting it again and realizing you just switched the whole thing off even though it never seemed to be on in the first place. And of course you can’t simply turn the TV on to find the last channel you were on; you have to navigate a menu of countless apps you probably don’t subscribe to. Watching TV feels more like a cognitive test than a way to relax.

The kitchen is also pointlessly complicated. My mom, the rental-company-supplied tech guy, and I stood around the Miele dishwasher, repeatedly bashing buttons just to get it to show signs of life. We checked the power to make sure it was plugged in. It was. More button pressing; still nothing. Finally, we noticed a QR code, along with a note encouraging us to register the appliance with an app. Wait—was that required to turn it on? The dishwasher had never been used before, which meant another call to the rental company to have them sort it out for us. The oven was equally perplexing. The controls are obtuse icons with no tactile feedback, hidden behind smoked black glass. I have a different brand at home, with its own black-glass display. After five years, I still have no idea what the chef’s-hat icon means.

On to the thermostats. When we got there, it was hot. But how hot, exactly? Round touch screens in various rooms took us through a labyrinth of tiny-text options just to set the temperature to 68 degrees. Or was it already at 68? We finally managed to select the temperature we wanted only to discover that a preset schedule overrode our choice, and we’d have to figure out how to override that.

The alarm system is operated in two places—from a device near the front door and another in the primary bedroom—by what are essentially iPads bolted to the wall. At my house, the alarm system has nine raised buttons on it for the code, and a couple more for common controls, such as dialing 911. Perfect. We have no idea how to operate these new screens. But they are screens, so they have to do something. Day and night, they show us the weather forecast.

Even getting inside the house is complicated. A digital lock on the front gate requires a four-digit PIN, but the PIN doesn’t work—the builders, it seems, never connected the lock to a power source. Instead, you’re supposed to enter the code into a different keypad panel that’s mounted to the wall next to the gate. Mercifully, you can ignore both the dead little computer bolted to the gate and the functioning one nearby it because the gate also comes equipped with a keyhole, and a key you can stick inside.

On top of all this tech floats a layer of lag. Flip an old-school light switch and the light comes on instantly. Tap an old-school remote and, after a blast of shimmering static, you’re watching TV. Press a button on these new systems and there’s a long pause before something happens—if anything happens at all.

I’m no Luddite. I run a software company! I see the allure of high-tech gadgets and have fallen for their promises before. When my wife and I built a house more than a decade ago, we opted for all kinds of automated systems: low-voltage controls, mechanized blinds, irrigation systems that measure rain so the sprinklers come on only when you need them. We regretted it almost immediately. What we discovered is that this stuff requires setup, which can take more time than just doing things manually, and is maddeningly glitchy, forcing you to pay someone handsomely by the visit or the hour to fix your appliances for you.

Tech makes many things better, but you shouldn’t have to learn how to use a house. You shouldn’t need a tech tour and an app (or five) to turn the heat down or clean the dishes. You shouldn’t have to worry that pressing the wrong button will set off a chain of events you don’t know how to undo. All these powerful processors and thousands of lines of code have succeeded in making everyday things slower, harder to use, and less reliable than they used to be.

Ellen Cushing: There are two types of dishwasher people

Maybe the technology is still in its primitive stage, some breakthrough will come, and tricked-out houses will soon work seamlessly, removing friction and frustration from everyday tasks. But I wouldn’t bet on it. A light switch used to have one job, and it either did it perfectly or it was very easy to find out why it didn’t. Today’s digital replacements are too sophisticated for their own good. They’re hard to integrate with one another and even harder to troubleshoot when they don’t work. Is it this thing? That thing? Both things? Something else entirely?

My wife and I are in the middle of another home renovation, and this time we’ve decided to go the good old analog route: switches you flip, dimmers you turn, and thermostats with a pin pointing at a number on a dial. That’s what I call progress.</div>

            <h2>Pete Davidson’s Charm Is Working Against Him</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-02-07</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/2026/02/pete-davidson-show-netflix-video-podcast/685920/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The first question to confront when considering The Pete Davidson Show, a new Netflix series that the streamer is calling a “video podcast,” is: What is a podcast? The term can be a little difficult to pin down; what initially referred to downloadable audio files you ported onto your iPod is today used for most online radio. Now the notion of a podcast is transforming again to include filmed entertainment. Bite-size clips of chat programs are flooding every social-media feed, in a desperate hunt for engagement. But I would argue that podcasts should always involve a dedicated feed you can listen to on your phone.

The Pete Davidson Show does not have that. Instead, the weekly program is available to consume only on Netflix, and only in video form. A cynic might wonder if branding The Pete Davidson Show a “podcast” is just a way for the streaming empire to avoid paying for the kind of unionized crews and production staff a talk show demands. Or perhaps, if I am being more charitable, Pete Davidson’s effort is considered a podcast because it’s imitating the stripped-down aesthetics of one. The host sits in a fairly bare garage, with a couple of paint cans stacked between two comfy armchairs. His first guest, the musician Machine Gun Kelly, doesn’t even have a place to put his coffee, so he sits it on the floor near his feet. Talk shows have bands and green rooms; podcasts are for raw, unfiltered chat, though preferably, for companies like Netflix, also between famous people.

So on that front, does The Pete Davidson Show deliver? There’s already a gigantic pile of celebrity talk programs in the podcasting space—many of them weak clones of other lo-fi interview podcasts, most obviously WTF With Marc Maron, which ended last year. Davidson, who has been in the public eye since joining the cast of Saturday Night Live at age 20, is the sort of highly scrutinized person viewers might want to learn more about. This is partly the allure of any public figure’s podcast: that you encounter them in a more candid mode.

But as a host, he is casual to a fault. He’s prone to slouching in his chair, ripping a thousand cigarettes, and reminiscing about various awkward interactions he and his guests have had at parties over the years. In the series premiere last week, Davidson and Kelly (who are good friends) hold court about, among other topics: Davidson’s fancy Japanese toilet; Kelly’s flight to the podcast taping, in upstate New York; acting together in The Dirt, the Mötley Crüe biopic; and generally weathering the slings and arrows of megastardom. There are interesting pockets of intimacy between the pair, as they discuss their mirrored battles with depression and addiction, and sweeter moments, like when they gush about their young daughters. But for being just 38 minutes long (which is pretty short by most podcasting standards), the episode feels unfocused at best.

Davidson’s inexperience becomes obvious when seated across someone much better versed in the medium. Episode 2 features Charlamagne tha God, a seasoned radio personality, whose comfort and facility with the format forces Davidson to keep up. He trades quips with the comedian before eking out further insights: A string of jokes about the rapper turned actor Ice-T and his longtime wife, Coco, becomes a reflection on the role romantic partners can play in one’s career. As Davidson thanks his guest for stopping by, he also notes Charlamagne’s prowess: “This also made me appreciate how amazing you are at this job,” he says.

Maybe Davidson can grow into the gig; very few hit podcasts emerge from the gate fully formed. But The Pete Davidson Show is a particularly rough lump of clay. The garage setting riffs on Maron’s format, but the space is devoid of any notable physical objects for guests to bounce off—nothing like Maron’s frequently remarked-upon tchotchkes or guitars. Davidson’s chat with Kelly has no structure, no segments, and no particular gimmick; and while none of that is required of a podcast, some sense of organization can help shape an otherwise-unformed snippet of conversation. Most vital, Davidson doesn’t have much interest in learning more about Kelly, because he doesn’t need to—this is his good friend, with whom he already has a rich history that the viewer only gets glimpses of over the course of their chat.

The lax vibe stands in stark relief to that of most successful celebrity-chat podcasts. Maron, who launched WTF when his comedy career was on a downswing, as peers emerged and surpassed him in fame, took an almost antagonistic approach with guests: He’d try to puzzle out their insecurities and ambitions, then compare them against his own. For Conan O’Brien, an old hand whose podcast Conan O’Brien Needs a Friend is a big player in the field, witty banter and appropriately leading queries come naturally; O’Brien also has plenty of pals on, but has a knack for turning their back-and-forth into a deeper examination of their friendship. The latest hit example is Amy Poehler’s Good Hang, which collected the first-ever Golden Globe for Best Podcast this year. As a host, Poehler has demonstrated a surprising amount of savvy in how she runs her show, from booking guests to steering them toward a compelling conversation.

Read: The Golden Globes tried to have it both ways

I kept thinking about Poehler’s show (which is filmed but is also available on an audio feed) while watching Davidson’s attempt. Good Hang is similarly pitched as a casual, low-stakes hour or so of chitchat between two celebrities; Poehler, one of Davidson’s fellow SNL alums, has chummy banter with a well-known subject, a role that has been filled by such major names as Jennifer Lawrence, Gwyneth Paltrow, and Ina Garten. But Poehler opens every episode by secretly calling up a friend of her guest on FaceTime, setting the mood for what she and her audience might be intrigued to learn. She then peppers her interviewees with a good mix of serious and silly questions, keeping them just goofy and off-balance enough to maybe reveal some vulnerabilities.

Nothing is revolutionary about what Poehler is doing, but she’s doing it well—it’s why the anodyne-seeming Good Hang has risen above the many imitators, to the point where anecdotes from the episodes regularly make news. Davidson’s chat with Kelly, on the other hand, seemingly vanished without a trace after its Friday drop. Perhaps some of his future guests will come armed with hotter takes, or juicier gossip, to avail the show’s relaxed host in his smoky garage. Or perhaps Netflix’s video-only podcasting experiment will go the way of many other such clones in this medium, which never took on board the lesson that podcasts require more than two microphones and a garage to actually be interesting.</div>

            <h2>The Mysterious Devices Speeding Mining Exploration in Utah</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-02-07</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/2026/02/mining-exploration-in-utah/685473/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Bushwhacking through a stand of stunted aspens above 10,000 feet in Utah’s Tushar mountain range, the mountain guide Trevor Katz held his Garmin to the sky and pointed it south. “We should just look for an opening,” he said, glancing over at his colleague, Bailey Pugh, from under a ball cap he’d cut into a visor.

He took a few steps steeply uphill, then down, careful not to slide on the scree. “It says it’s right below us, by probably 10 meters. Wait, five.”

Wading through walls of branches, he and Pugh circled, eyes trained on the ground. Then, there it was. Stuck in the dirt, the hexagonal silver node looked like a device an alien could have planted. Its small antenna and carrying strap sat above the earth. A sharp spike below anchored it into the slope. It would be a strange thing to stumble upon this so high in the mountains, surrounded only by what can survive at such an elevation.

This is just one of 200 nodes planted across the range in a tidy grid, each tracked with a GPS waypoint. Earlier, they had placed the nodes in the ground; now it was time to extract them. Pugh hoisted this one out of the ground and into her pack. Then it was back to bushwhacking.

“This is why they had to hire mountain guides,” Pugh told me, as we picked our steps carefully across boulders.

At the beginning of the summer, Katz and Pugh had received an email from the owner of a guiding company they’d worked for in the past: A client needed mountain-savvy day workers for a new project—any interest? The biggest hint they got about the purpose of the project was the field crew’s meeting place, the Deer Trail Mine, at the mountains’ eastern base. Each team was given a set of GPS waypoints and told to take a 20-pound node, about as big as a football, to each location, plant it in the ground, and mark its location. “It was really mysterious,” Levi Warr, another crew member, told me. But the pay was good—$500 a day, plus a per diem, as much as they’d usually earn for a few days of guiding—and the instructions were clear enough, so out they went.

Only as the summer went on did the crew come to understand, from chatting with the project geologists and fieldwork managers, what exactly they were doing: helping locate some of the nation’s most in-demand minable resources across a patchwork of public and private lands. Arranged in grids that connect to low-Earth-orbit satellites, the nodes are capable of collecting and sharing data used to create high-resolution maps of anomalies, miles underground, that might be gold, copper, nickel, lithium, or other minerals.

The nodes used in the project were first released three years ago by the Australian company Fleet Space Technologies, and although they’ve been adopted by mining giants internationally, how widely they’re being used in the United States is unclear. Compared with older and more invasive survey methods, this technology can be deployed with minimal impact. According to Fleet Space, it can be particularly useful for surveying areas where permits are required—for the Fishlake National Forest, for example, and the Bureau of Land Management territory enveloping the Tushar Mountains. If this quiet method of mineral exploration is successful, it will have threaded a loophole in the law governing public lands, helping open them for mining that much more quickly—and controversially. All it will take is a few hundred nodes, a clear view of the sky to connect to satellites, and a small team of people who know how to traverse rough terrain.

Historically, mining-exploration projects have depended on a giant boom. Drop hammers, trucks with vibrating baseplates, and dynamite blasts send seismic waves through the Earth’s subsurface to a grid of geophones. The waves’ travel times are translated into rough maps of mineralized zones. On U.S. public lands, taking even this first step toward a new mine means getting approval, whether from the Forest Service or the BLM, a process that can be stringent and slow, requiring data collection and environmental assessment.

Instead of shakes and booms, Fleet Space’s node system relies on the naturally occurring vibrations of the earth and the sound waves created by those walking upon it. These scraps of seismic data from everyday life are gathered by the nodes’ internal geophones. After collection, the data are processed into “ambient-noise tomography,” or ANT, surveys, which provide the highest level of detail of what is underground, compared with traditional methods. (Fleet Space did not respond to a request for comment.)

The American West has long led the country in producing gold, copper, coal, and silver, as well as rare, sought-after elements, such as beryllium, that can be used for aerospace and defense technologies. The unique geologic profiles here—the Colorado Plateau, the Basin and Range region, the Rocky Mountains—are side effects of ancient inland seas, volcanic history, and an active boundary between two tectonic plates. Billions of years of pressure, folding, and depositing created a region rich with minerals just close enough to the surface to mine.

In the 1860s, white settlers flocked to what would become Marysvale, where the Deer Trail Mine is now located, with high hopes to strike gold, silver, and copper. By the 1930s, though, most of the mines had closed: The shallower, more accessible resources had been tapped, and it was too expensive to keep trying to get rich.

Over the years, a series of companies have bought the Deer Trail Mine in failed attempts to revive it, Helen and Alan Johnson told me. They’re lifelong residents of Marysvale and former employees of the mine, and they agreed to meet me at a Mexican restaurant in Orem, Utah, to talk history. Most recently, in 2018, MAG Silver, a Canadian company, bought the mine. The new owners had started exploring national-forest land for silver, gold, and copper with more traditional methods before turning to the Fleet Space nodes for this summer’s surveys.

These minerals, plus others that Fleet Space nodes can help discover, including cobalt, nickel, and lithium, are all on the country’s list of critical minerals. Demand for these materials is growing exponentially: Together and separately, they are used in iPhones, photovoltaic panels, combat drones, and many other technologies now key to Americans’ quality of life or national security. Some materials, like diamonds, can be whipped up in labs, but these particular resources come only from the ground.

Now the right combination of technology and political timing could mean that whatever is still in Utah’s mountains and elsewhere could be within reach for those who want it. As tariffs have kicked in and America seeks to ease its reliance on China for refined metals and minerals, the Trump administration has turned its attention to opening up U.S. land for mining—even when that means that the companies doing the mining aren’t American ones.

To plant one of the ANT nodes, Trevor Katz told me while walking up a slope scattered with juniper trees, does not require much. Hike in with a pickax, dig a hole a few inches deep, and place the sharp end of the node into that hole, making sure the spike containing the geophone is completely covered. To extract it, just pull it out of the ground and hike it out.

He and Pugh did this over and over, often putting in a dozen miles a day, as the field crew placed and extracted 200 nodes four separate times, first for a regional survey that covered about 50 square miles across BLM territory, national forest, and land the mine already owns, then for three surveys, mostly on Forest Service land, that made a more detailed search for anomalies.

To regulate mining activities on public land, balancing its responsibility to both conserve the land and make it useful, the Forest Service is supposed to consider an activity’s “surface disturbance.” Exploration that’s unlikely to cause “significant” disturbance can go forward without the Forest Service’s involvement. This distinction has helped separate casual use of public lands—such as private citizens panning for gold, which anyone can do freely—from commercial activities.

The surveys conducted last summer for the Deer Trail Mine project didn’t have any permits associated with them. I filed a Freedom of Information Act request for documentation of the ANT surveys filed by or on behalf of any of the stakeholders involved in the project, including MAG Silver and the Deer Trail Mine; none were filed with the BLM or the U.S. Forest Service. The companies involved in the project either did not respond to requests for comment or declined to comment for this article. The Fishlake National Forest Ranger Station, which has long worked with Deer Trail Mine and is responsible for all permitting and communication regarding the company’s mining activities on Forest Service land, told me that any commercial exploration at all would be expected to be disclosed to the rangers but that the station had no knowledge of the ANT surveys.

A spokesperson for the Forest Service’s national press office told me, however, that this type of survey does not need a permit or even a formal notice of intent, which the agency uses to determine whether further oversight is needed. But the legal experts I asked about the ANT nodes told me that they fall into a gray area of the law.

The key term is “significant disturbance,” Elizabeth Craddock, a government-relations attorney and a partner at Holland & Knight in Washington, D.C., who specializes in natural resources, told me. But the regulation itself doesn’t define what significant means, she said, so what counts is up for interpretation. These commercial-exploration projects seem to have found a way to quietly bypass federal regulations that outline how and when approval is given before exploration begins on public lands.

If the Deer Trail Mine project goes back into operation, it will need permits. This past fall, it was acquired, as part of MAG Silver, by another Canadian company, Pan American Silver—which has not pursued any further work on the project so far. But any next steps toward reopening a mine here could go faster than ever too.

Last March, President Trump signed an executive order directing federal agencies to expedite mining projects and prioritize mining activities on public lands. The administration has also made changes, at least temporarily, to the National Environmental Policy Act review process to accelerate project approvals. Agencies are no longer required to analyze long-term environmental effects that are hard to trace back to the initial cause, which significantly reduces the scope of every project’s review.

Opening up new mining operations would be in keeping with the founding directive of the Forest Service, which mandates the balance of protecting resources and extracting them. Many mines give small, rural towns a needed economic boost too—in Marysvale, for instance, the median household income is $28,750 a year, and the unemployment rate is 63 percent.

Still, while he’s out retrieving the nodes that could make new mines a reality, Katz told me, he’s been “telling myself the little copes that everybody does”—that it’ll be a long time before this land is developed. Looking out over the windswept tops of Mount Holly and Delano Peak, into a valley meadow called Horse Heaven, and across the entire range, I imagined 800 empty holes where the nodes used to be. Katz had mentioned that the project’s marketing materials clearly said that all the holes would be filled in—perhaps a gesture toward a remediation plan for the survey’s relatively small impacts—but that he and other guides had not, in fact, filled them in. Those holes were nothing you’d see unless you were looking; it’s likely that the first hard autumn rain quietly washed them away. But if this particular combination of technology and policy does add up to more mining across the country, the result will be loud and obvious.</div>

            <h2>What Everyone Assumes About Jeffrey Epstein</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-02-07</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/2026/02/epstein-files-guilt-association/685917/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">In the case of Jeffrey Epstein, association seems to imply guilt. And so the release of the so-called Epstein files is generating a wave of firings, resignations, and public apologies.

The health influencer Peter Attia had to resign from a protein-bar company after emails showed him participating in crude banter with Epstein. CBS News, where Attia was recently hired as a contributor, pulled a 60 Minutes segment featuring him. Brad Karp, who in one email to Epstein gushed, “You’re amazing,” is stepping down as chair of the law firm Paul Weiss. Queen’s University Belfast has announced that it is removing former U.S. Senator George Mitchell’s name from its peace institute and his bust from its campus. Mitchell, who is now 92 years old, presided over the negotiation of the Good Friday agreement in 1998 and served as the school’s chancellor for a decade. But the files suggest that Epstein had scheduled a meeting with him as recently as 2013. Los Angeles officials are calling for the city’s Olympic Committee chair to resign because he exchanged flirtatious emails with Ghislaine Maxwell, Epstein’s accomplice, in 2003. The number of people who have put out statements insisting that they did nothing illegal and apologizing for having ever known Epstein is in the dozens and rising quickly.

Nothing comparable happened in the cases of other high-profile sex criminals. The many famous friends of Harvey Weinstein or Bill Cosby generally did not issue public apologies. Epstein is different because, under a certain set of assumptions, an individual’s presence in the files is presumptively damning. Epstein is known to have paid or coerced dozens, possibly hundreds, of teen girls, some as young as 14, to perform sexual acts. Beyond what has been proved, the conventional wisdom holds that Epstein built his network by trafficking teen girls to other powerful men, whom he then blackmailed to generate his mysterious wealth; that his private plane and island were essentially brothels; and that even friends who didn’t participate in his crimes were surely aware of them, and chose to consort with him anyway.

Those assumptions are all widely held—but poorly substantiated. The Epstein files reveal plenty of powerful people to have tolerated or participated in disgusting and shameful behavior. Far from shedding light on a grand conspiracy, however, the files bolster the case that although terrible crimes were committed, there never was a larger conspiracy to begin with.

For anyone who has only passively kept up with the Epstein story, this is hard to wrap one’s head around. The notion that Epstein routinely trafficked teen girls to other men aboard the Lolita Express is widely accepted as fact. But the accusations that led to his initial criminal conviction were specific to Epstein himself. The notion of other abusers arose later, largely owing to explosive allegations first made in 2014 by Virginia Giuffre. Giuffre, who committed suicide in 2025, claimed that Epstein had trafficked her to some of his friends, including the nobleman formerly known as Prince Andrew and the defense attorney Alan Dershowitz. She may have been telling the truth—we do not know—but her claims, which later grew to include more men, have never been substantiated. She dropped the accusation against Dershowitz, saying she “may have made a mistake,” after he sued for defamation. (Andrew settled a case with Giuffre out of court while maintaining his innocence.)

Kaitlyn Tiffany: America will be reading the Epstein files for decades

The attorney Brad Edwards has represented more than 200 Epstein victims in civil lawsuits. As someone who earns money by suing perpetrators, he is perhaps the last person on earth with an incentive to downplay the culpability of Epstein’s rich friends. Last week, Edwards told the BBC that one of his clients says Epstein flew her to the United Kingdom for sex with Andrew. But in an interview with ABC News last year, Edwards nonetheless dismissed the idea that Epstein had run a trafficking ring. “Jeffrey Epstein was the pimp and the john. He was his own No. 1 client,” he said. “Nearly all of the exploitation and abuse of all of the women was intended to benefit only Jeffrey Epstein and Jeffrey Epstein’s sexual desires.” (Maxwell was convicted of trafficking girls to Epstein.) Edwards allowed that “a select few” of Epstein’s friends might have “engaged in sexual acts with a select few of the girls that Jeffrey Epstein was exploiting or abusing,” but argued that Epstein otherwise lived a double life. In one, he hobnobbed with artists, billionaires, and politicians. In the other, he abused women and girls. “For the most part,” Edwards said, “those two worlds did not overlap.”

The theory that Epstein was blackmailing his rich contacts was also always based on speculation. As an exhaustive New York Times Magazine investigation recently explained, Epstein built his fortune mainly by insinuating himself as a wealth manager for a few superrich old men and drawing hefty fees. One of those men, Leslie Wexner, has said that Epstein “misappropriated” $46 million of his money.

Nor is it obvious that Epstein’s friends necessarily knew about his crimes. Some surely did—Brad Karp, the Paul Weiss chair, kept emailing with Epstein through 2019, after his offenses had become national news—but plenty might not have. His 2008 plea deal is scandalous precisely because he was allowed to admit to the lesser offense of soliciting underage prostitution, rather than rape or child sexual abuse. He spent only a year in jail and continued to move in polite society once he got out. Acquaintances might have taken all that as evidence that whatever he had done wasn’t so bad, or they may not have known about it at all. He surely did not go around telling them the truth.

Inversely, having been friends with Epstein before his conviction is no proof of ignorance. Donald Trump, for example, insists that he fell out with Epstein in the 2000s, before the guilty plea. But in 2002, he told New York magazine that Epstein was a “terrific guy” before noting, “It is even said that he likes beautiful women as much as I do, and many of them are on the younger side.”  The notorious birthday book that was released well before the most recent document dump makes clear that many of Epstein’s powerful friends knew about and celebrated his interest in girls.

Epstein has been dead for much longer than he was a household name. Although he had appeared in the news over the years, few Americans knew who he was until November 2018, when the investigative reporter Julie K. Brown published her now-legendary exposé in the Miami Herald. Less than eight months later, the Department of Justice charged Epstein with sex trafficking, and in August 2019—less than a year after the story broke—his lifeless body was found hanging in the Brooklyn jail cell where he was awaiting trial.

In death, Epstein has taken on far more significance than he did in life. Some Americans were already primed to believe in international pedophilia rings. Bonus points if they were run by wealthy Jews—Jews who were perhaps on the Mossad payroll, as many conspiracists have insisted Epstein was. Especially potent was the notion of a “client list” naming everyone in Epstein’s trafficking ring. This idea seemed to explain why he’d received a lenient deal in 2008 (to protect his powerful clients) and why he had supposedly been murdered in jail (to keep him from talking).

This was all a natural fit for members of the MAGA right, some of whom already believed that Trump had been sent by God to expose pedophiles. Even though Trump was president when Epstein died in federal custody, and had enjoyed a well-publicized friendship with him in the period when Epstein is known to have been abusing teen girls, the MAGA movement nurtured the idea that Democrats were covering up “the Epstein files” to protect their own. Trump himself said that he would release the files if he won a second term. During a Fox News interview in February 2025, Attorney General Pam Bondi claimed that the client list was “sitting on my desk right now to review. That’s been a directive by President Trump.”

Then Trump abruptly backtracked, declaring the whole Epstein matter to be a “witch hunt.” Suddenly, Release the files was just about the only thing this nation could agree on. Trump’s explanations for the reversal were so bizarrely unconvincing that it was hard to believe the files wouldn’t contain damaging information about him. The longer Trump delayed, the more explosive the files seemed destined to be. Could the client list include Trump himself?

Jonathan Chait: Trump’s Epstein denials are ever so slightly unconvincing

The truth seems to be that there never was a client list. The Epstein files encompass millions of documents in the Department of Justice’s possession, including seemingly every email to or from Epstein’s account over a period of years. To say that someone is “in the Epstein files” therefore doesn’t mean much on its own. Some names are discussed by Epstein and his assistants, but are not attached to any correspondence. Others appear only in news clippings. Trump does appear, many times, but in the third person. (Trump famously does not like to use email.) The most explosive claims against him are unvetted allegations submitted to the government.

Many of the emails are newsworthy. Some of Epstein’s male friends seem to have relied on him for introductions to young, but not underage, women who were either sex workers or aspiring sugar babies. In one email, Epstein tells Andrew, then 50, about a beautiful 26-year-old Russian woman that Epstein thinks he should meet. Andrew replies that he’d be “delighted.” In others, Steve Tisch, a co-owner of the New York Giants, solicits information about potential sex partners from Epstein, at points asking for clarification on whether they’re a “working girl” or “civilian.” (Both Andrew and Tisch have denied any wrongdoing.) Peter Mandelson, who was recently removed from his role as British ambassador to the United States over his Epstein ties, not only emerges as one of Epstein’s closest and creepiest confidants, but also appears to have fed Epstein financially valuable information from meetings with government officials. Noam Chomsky, the linguist and political theorist, is seen advising Epstein on how to manage the fallout from his conviction.

Other documents contradict what prominent people have said about their connections to Epstein. Elon Musk, for example, is one of the world’s foremost purveyors of Epstein conspiracism. He posted last fall that Epstein “tried to get me to go to his island and I REFUSED.” In fact, as The New York Times has reported, the files suggest that Musk was eager to go: “What day/night will be the wildest party on your island?” he emailed Epstein in 2012. Howard Lutnick, the secretary of commerce, has claimed that he vowed in the mid-2000s to “never be in a room with that disgusting person ever again.” The files show him emailing Epstein in 2012 to arrange a family visit to Epstein’s private island.

More unseemly or even criminal material may well come out. Perhaps evidence will even emerge to prove that Epstein systematically trafficked minors to other men or blackmailed them over legal but secret liaisons. But so far, none has.

Elizabeth Bruenig: Circles of Epstein hell

Because the Epstein conspiracy theory is treated as reality by so many, however, merely appearing in the files seems to be grounds for suspicion. And because Epstein cultivated as many high-profile contacts as possible, that leaves a whole lot of people potentially exposed to unfounded insinuations. A Daily Beast headline over the weekend, for example, declared of the journalist Nellie Bowles, “MAGA-Curious CBS Boss’s Wife Busted Ingratiating Herself With Epstein.” In fact, the files show Bowles, who is now married to CBS News head Bari Weiss, emailing with Epstein to interview him for a New York Times story. An Inside Higher Ed article published Tuesday lists nine academics who appear in the files and notes that this puts “pressure on those named to explain their communications”—as many of them then do, in statements to their campus newspapers. A sure way to get engagement on social media is to extrapolate recklessly from suggestive nuggets of information. J. K. Rowling evidently felt compelled to issue a statement contradicting files-based accusations that she had invited Epstein to the opening of her Harry Potter musical.

Epstein committed horrific acts against a staggering number of women and girls, but, judging from the available evidence, he was not at the center of a global pedophilia ring that included dozens of criminal co-conspirators. The apparent truth is somehow even more depressing. Smarmy jerks can get obscenely wealthy in this country just by managing other people’s money. Men who sexually abuse women and children can be charming. The most accomplished people in our society can be terrible judges of character. They can, in the pursuit of proximity to wealth and power, ignore or downplay what’s right in front of them. The Epstein files show us that the world is an ugly and unfair place. But we already knew that.</div>

Precisely!  If anything, CarPlay should have just a limited set of apps, such as Maps/Waze, Phone, Music/Podcasts, Sirius XM (if the owner is a subscriber) and maybe Messages.  The whole idea is for essential items to be on the navigation screen, so that the driver doesn&#39;t need to fiddle w/ it

Depends on the app I suppose. But it&#39;s certainly going to be less distracting than having to use a touch UI. I don&#39;t really see how putting finer grain control into speech downgrades safety.

Fuck all. The demand rate being discussed is tiny. Maybe your EV only lasts for 500000miles instead of 550000miles. Either way it&#39;s going to be turned into a small recycled cube before the battery is dead. The idea of being afraid of your battery longevity really needs to die. We have the data that proves they aren&#39;t like your smartphone.

What if the cost to charge a battery is sooooo tiny compared to the cost impact to the life of a battery being used to supplement the grid like this? (Multi thousand dollar battery divided by 500 or a thousand or so charge cycles...)

It was easy to miss though. It&#39;s only mentionned twice in the first line of the summary.

I participate in Tesla Electric&#39;s Virtual Power Plant  [tesla.com] in Texas. It&#39;s similar to this pilot program in Massachusetts, it just uses my Powerwall instead of my Model 3&#39;s battery to help out the grid in periods of high demand.

In Tesla app there is a slider for the Powerwall called Backup Reserve [tesla.com].  It controls how much of the Powerwall is reserved for home backup, the remainder can be used for the Virtual Power Plant.  It defaults to 20%, I bumped mine up to 30%.

I would expect to see a similar option for EV to G

You assume there isn&#39;t a setting to not drain below a certain threshold. It&#39;s trivial to make a device that only allows the top 5% of your charge to be used for the grid. Also trivial to have a button to keep the next charge at 100% which you can hit the day before a long trip.

These chargers create a chance that when you need to drive your EV it would not be sufficiently charged. More so, in emergencies it makes more likely that your EV would be discharged and not available for driving. Compensation for taking on such risks should be much higher than a cost of charger.Yeah, it seems kind of like letting them siphon gas out of your tank for others to use.  If you need the money I guess you gotta do what you gotta do.

This might be a good idea, but I see two potential problemsWhat happens if you need your EV in an emergency and the battery was drained to power the grid?How does it affect battery life?Also, does the utility pay for the storage or reduce electric rates for those who participate?I&#39;m not totally opposed, it might actually be a good idea

Today, the sales brochure reads: &quot;This functionality enables EVs, including electric buses and trucks, to provide backup power during outages and alleviate pressure on the grid during peak energy demand.&quot;

Tomorrow, the Federal law reads: &quot;This functionality mandates that all EVs, including electric buses and trucks, provide backup power during outages and alleviate pressure on the grid during peak energy demand.&quot;

Just in case those falling for the free-vertising, still haven&#39;t learned their lesson.

I have no desire to add any renewable power generation devices to my home. It was never designed with that in mind, starting with the siting. It will never be optimal. However, I am more than ready to be a consumer of renewable energy, the economics are very compelling. Installing bi-directional batteries, however, will have a negligible impact on my home -- maybe take up some space on my garage wall, that&#39;s about it. But having backup power right at hand is a great incentive. And, distributing power storag

There are comparatively huge batteries just sitting around doing nothing. The impact on their life is tiny and the metal casing they sit in is going to have turned into rust long before they become unusable.

Now of course the sensible way to go over this would be to make those people participate in the profits the grid provider gets from storing cheap and free electricity and selling it again when it&#39;s expensive, but this is end-term capitalism.

From https://www.masscec.com/massce... [masscec.com], they expect to draw 3kW - 10kW for 3 hours, for a total draw of 9 kWh - 30 kWh.

We have a Kona EV with a 65 kWh battery, which we limit to 80% charge to maximize battery life.  Their expected draw is 14% - 46% of battery life.  With our existing V2L adapter, the Kona can specify the minimum battery level where it will cut off.  If we set it to cut off at 60%, then they could have 20% of the battery, but no more.  60% is enough for all our expected driving for a couple days, so I&#39;d be comfortable with that.  But also, odds are that the power drain event will be in the evening, and there&#39;ll be plenty of time overnight to recharge back to 80%.

Lithium batteries don&#39;t like being charged all the way to 100% or drained to 0%, but running them back and forth between 60-80% won&#39;t measurably damage them for thousands of cycles.

If the software were better, we&#39;d be able to say, &quot;We want to be back at 80% at 5AM.  And in any case, we want to keep at least 60% of our battery for our own needs - driving, V2L for our own house in a power failure, etc.  Within those constraints, you&#39;re welcome to the rest of the power, but we&#39;re selling it at $0.60/kWh.  If you *really* want power, we&#39;ll go from 60% to 40%, but it&#39;ll cost you $1.00/kWh below 60%.&quot;  And then the grid could decide whether it&#39;s willing to pay our price, and how much it wants.

Even if it hadn&#39;t been, it would still be bullshit.

From a research perspective it&#39;s kind of interesting... like ye olde Life or Eliza.  But as an actual service?  It&#39;s like pointing several Eliza agents at each other.

&quot;How does that make you feel that you&#39;re an, AI.&quot;

What LLMs have demonstrated clearly is that humans are far stupider than we thought and that language is in fact far less valuable than we thought. The assumption was that language was a high level skill. What we are discovering is that it&#39;s far less associated with animal intelligence, and far more associated with echoing and linguistic patterns. Saying something sensible doesn&#39;t require intelligence. It&#39;s like a parrot who can form a sentence.

Some of the less intelligent members of our species are struggling to differentiate between the two. They were always far stupider than we&#39;d gave them credit for.

...it does about AI agentsIt&#39;s a dumpster fire and a security nightmareIt was made for fun and to see what happenedIt was immediately overrun with scammers, jokers, vandals and a few honest AI agentsThe actual, honest AI agents showed the potential usefulness of agent to agent communicationThe rest showed how awful some people are

Yes, it is not really much different from any other garbage generator out there.

Possibly, but it definitely means he hasn&#39;t spent any significant time with it.  Pay $20 and try it for a month and then post about how awful it is.

My initial experience with Claude wasn&#39;t great.  In fact it completely failed at the task I gave it.  But later on I began to use it in more specific ways---here&#39;s my code, can you modify it to do foo, and add a feature bar---and it really began to work for me.   Was pretty incredible actually.  And I began to use it to teach me and explain parts of the API to me, complete with examples based on the code I already had.  And it&#39;s pretty good at helping you quickly get up to speed with code you&#39;ve never seen before.  Plan mode is also a key to success.  I now use Claude regularly as an assistant.

Claude is also a pretty good debugging tool. Over the past couple of months I&#39;ve run into problems with my code that I banged my head against for hours, knowing it was probably something simple and obvious but I couldn&#39;t see it.  Finally I told Claude what was happening and had it analyze the code and more often than not it found the problem with my logic, even pointing out something in another part of the program that I  hadn&#39;t considered that caused the problem.

I do very little vibe coding, but I have used Claude to add features I needed to an OBS plugin.  I also used it to modify a flutter app to add complementary features to communicate with my modified OBS plugin.  I have no experience in flutter or dart. But I did review the changes Claude made and they were quite reasonable.

Claude isn&#39;t perfect or all that creative, but it still is a game changer.  90% of what programmers do isn&#39;t novel or ground breaking, but just putting together existing parts in new ways that fill a need.  Claude is very good at assisting in this.  The only downside is Claude is fairly expensive.  I can only use it for about 1 hour before I hit my 5 hour limit.  And if I was to use it heavily the Pro account wouldn&#39;t last very long in a week.  $100 for the max account is pretty expensive.

I&#39;m looking at other models that are improving all the time.  OpenCode cli (not too bad) with Kimi 2.5 Thinking, Qwen3.  Not quite as good as Claude but still darn useful.  I&#39;m tempted to get hardware to run Qwen3 locally.  Probably AMD Ryzen AI Max+ 395-based system.  Seems a bit ludicrous how expensive they are for what is basically gaming laptop hardware.  And I expect the price to jump in the next month, maybe even double by the end of the year.

No, but they &quot;gave grunt work to the code monkeys.&quot; People have become a bit more hesitant to use language like that these days, so they just say junior developer.

And make inexperienced ones produce more crap. I tried it a little and it could really speed things up, but it is like outsourcing to junior developer, except it is much faster and cheaper.  In general it is good at scrabing examples, produce templates code, fixing some bugs, but it makes quite a few mistakes.Agreed.  There are some things that I find pretty annoying about it that you have to tell it explicitly not to do.  For example, pulling in really old versions of NPM or Python packages.  It has a propensity to not know when it is correct or incorrect, or perhaps, it it is unable to share its level of uncertainty.  Most of these things can be mitigated by updating and refining Claude&#39;s prompting.I think there are some things those of us clutching our pearls at the thought of all of the AI slop ought to keep in mind:

We are not all writing air traffic control systems or medical device firmware.  There is an awful lot of &quot;enterprise software&quot; that is not much more than database CRUD and visualization.  People are not going to die if that software is not using the most efficient data types, etc.Will somebody five years from now pick up your AI generated software and not know what to do with it?  Possibly, but mostly only if you are not taking the time to generate unit and integration testing as well as documentation, and there is now basically no excuse now to skip doing either. Senior developers should be spending more of their time thinking about the architecture and use cases of their applications, and less time thinking about whether HashMap or FxHashMap is more efficient in a given scenario. If we are being honest, there is already a bunch of slop in our industry.  Junior (or just bad) devs copying/pasting from StackOverflow...  Shortcuts taken during unreasonable deadlines... Stuff we just aren&#39;t told or don&#39;t know...  Software development has been in a race to the bottom for a while now.
Most of the furniture in my home is not hand-made by Amish carpenters, it is machine milled and partially assembled by cheap labor.  It is not as good and will not last generations as hand-crafted furniture, and that is okay.  For better and for worse, a lot of SMB executives look at software the same way (at least until it doesn&#39;t work), they want &quot;good enough&quot; software that works until the next merger or acquisition, so they can cash out and go on to the next thing.  They are not intersted in paying for software built using hand-built assembler (SpinRite - we miss ya&#39;).The good news is that there are things we can do, and if we get good at them, AI can do the mundane bits and software engineering will still be a thing.  We get better at Specification and Test driven development.  We review the hell out of the code AI generates and make sure our linting and bench-marking tools are up to snuff.  We get really good at authoring prompts that keeps AI tools within the guardrails.  And yes, we keep AI away from the really critical stuff, at least for now...

And make inexperienced ones produce more crap. I tried it a little and it could really speed things up, but it is like outsourcing to junior developer, except it is much faster and cheaper.  In general it is good at scrabing examples, produce templates code, fixing some bugs, but it makes quite a few mistakes.

Agreed.  There are some things that I find pretty annoying about it that you have to tell it explicitly not to do.  For example, pulling in really old versions of NPM or Python packages.  It has a propensity to not know when it is correct or incorrect, or perhaps, it it is unable to share its level of uncertainty.  Most of these things can be mitigated by updating and refining Claude&#39;s prompting.

I think there are some things those of us clutching our pearls at the thought of all of the AI slop ought to keep in mind:

Iterating on code is not strictly necessary when you have agents that can reason about and output thousands of lines of code in minutes. Any new requirement has the potential to result in architecture-breaking changes that may be best solved through a complete rewrite. What happens with the code in the implementation may not, in a completely spec-driven scenario, be relevant at all assuming no human developers are expected to work on it.

In my experience... if I ask Claude to help with something that&#39;s my strong point (like my core coding), it&#39;s like training a junior programmer, and I can solve my problems faster myself.  But... when I need something outside my core expertise, like helper programs, wrappers, or interfaces to other technologies I&#39;m not familiar with, it&#39;s a very fast way to get 95% of the way there without wasting time climbing the learning curve myself for a one-time need.Like any tool, you have to know when to use it and when not to, and what its strengths and weak points are.

GitHub Copilot the same. It can leverage Claude and lets you review every change. And I find that I *do* have to review every change. It often makes weird, inconsistent, and even plain wrong changes. Sometimes it wants to remove functions that are outside the scope of my prompt, even if those functions are being used. But I do find the tool very much a time-saver.

A rich $EvilEntity that is able to compromise Claude and get it to insert remote exploitable bugs it could do a great deal of damage. Especially if Claude is used by programmers who are inexperienced or too lazy to check its code.

I mean for decades every developer has known number of commits or lines of code is a horrible metric.

I have to wonder how much it is like last year, there was a similar story on /. about how Github said something like 90% of users had tried copilot. But then you read the article and realize that means how many had clicked the link they had repeatedly thrown on the front page for every single Github user, the metric was flat out a lie.

Claude *is* a game changer. It and tools like it are here to stay, but this can still be a hype piece, and I&#39;m pretty sure it is.

Aside from the problems that other mention, I have found that, while it can solve a problem, and the code works, many times it doesn&#39;t choose the best solution.

I wanted some code to edit a database table, and there was in the framework a grid control that did it practically all, with basically one hundred lines of code. But the AI didn&#39;t choose it, but some other control that required lots more of code, and the associated difficulties when modifying or expanding it. The grid control was relatively new, so p

I have to think that most people posting here don&#39;t use Claude for coding, or at least not recently. It is amazingly effective, and has steadily and noticeably improved month over month. From the article (which many apparently didn&#39;t bother to read);

&quot;Provide Claude (the CLI) an input such as a spreadsheet, a codebase, a link to a webpage and then ask it to achieve an objective. It then makes a plan, verifies details, and then executes it.&quot;

And that&#39;s what it does. It can describe in detail what it would accomplish and write it out in a document for you to review. You can make revisions to the document directly or just tell it what to change. You can tell it to implement things in phases so you can check for correctness step by step. The code quality is usually quite good, and if there are bugs you can just paste in the error messages and it will fix them.

This not a bad thing, it is empowering. An average programmer turns into a 10x. An excellent programmer becomes a 100x.  What&#39;s not to like?

The bias, the selective coverage, the fabrications, the uncorrected errors, and so on.  Walter Duranty, Jayson Blair, calling The Babylon Bee a &quot;misinformation site&quot; because of its satire, parroting the Duke lacrosse and John McCain affair hoaxes (the latter when the claims were decades stale and long debunked), forcing out James Bennet and Bari Weiss for publishing a US Senator on the opinion page, the 1619 Project, etc.

I haven&#39;t ever seen any lies on CNN to be honest.  When they talk about Trump lying on this or that they generally give the evidence.  I can&#39;t say I watch FOX but it&#39;s hard to see how they could provide evidence for all the things they say.  The overall point being that true journalism is double and triple checked.  You don&#39;t just broadcast the words of the president verbatim without backing it up if there is true journalistic integrity.  They call it FOX news but without journalistic integrity they are really entertainment and not news.

&quot;Anonymous source(s) reportedâ¦&quot; is how they legally get away with lying. They all do it. Anyone still relying on mass media is fooling themselves. Best to watch the people making the claims say it directly from their mouths. And not snippets or sound bites, the entirety of their speeches, interviews, and statements.

I saw an article talking about how Americans are surprised they are not able to claim the new tax deductions on their recent car purchase because they didnâ(TM)t read the fine pri

Fox News is just about always truthful. You just have to watch out for the tricks they use (on 95%+ of their stories)...

(1) non-representative selection. Headline &quot;illegal immigrant murders local mother&quot;, which is true in this case, but they don&#39;t report the other 99 murders that went by immigrants, and don&#39;t report a general trend of immigrants causing less crime overall per capita. (I made up this specific example to illustrate their trick)

(2) report quotes: headline &quot;Biden&#39;s senility was covered up, says

This law would be totally unenforceable for at least three reasons. First, I&#39;d like you to define &quot;AI&quot;. (The law will have to do that, and it will fail to do so in any meaningful fashion.) Second, prove to me in court that AI was used. Three, this law is obviously contrary to the US Constitution.

Another &quot;We&#39;re Doing Something About It&quot; theatrical gesture, with a taste of panic over how the world has been taken over by AI and there ain&#39;t a fucking thing anybody can do about it.

My arguments in reply of your concerns: 1) Definition: They don&#39;t have to define AI in the law; the newspaper are not going to invent some new mathematical approach, they are going to use commercial tools. The newspapers will self-incriminate by using tools that claim to be AI. Anyway LLM is another worg they can include.2) Proof in court: It is enforceable as any regulation of a process that isn&#39;t immediately visible (like in the food or water industry). A whistleblower will talk and bring internal emails.

Not generated by a human as it&#39;s been done for centuries. Now start splitting hairs and moving the goalposts.

Second, prove to me in court that AI was used.

See above. Start splitting the hairs more finely.

Three, this law is obviously contrary to the US Constitution.

The 1st Amendment prevents the abridging of the freedom of the press. Within that freedom is the choice of how to generate the material it puts on its pages and how to label it. That freedom also gives it the right to say whatever it likes and only to be held liable for severe defamation. In that context the bill is surely unconstitutional.

The problem here, of course, is that the freedom of the press is based on the assumption that journalists and editors can be expected to do the right thing. This has been

            <div id="article-text">Sign up for the Surge, the newsletter that covers most important political nonsense of the week, delivered to your inbox every Saturday.

Welcome to this week’s edition of the Surge, which once again has had the NFL reject its pitch to perform a live reading of this newsletter as the Super Bowl halftime show.

The United States, and its news, failed to improve this week. Congress did fund the government but is already stuck ahead of the next spending deadline. Tulsi Gabbard remains at large. And while it’s not entirely about politics—though it’s not not about politics—we couldn’t resist a few words about the gutting of the local newspaper.

Blah, blah, life is sad—well, not anymore, because we’re kicking off 2026 primary season with Texas Week! Everybody grab two handfuls of sizzlin’ Texas chili (??) and git to reading.

We are less than a month from the start of 2026 primary season, as Texas voters go to the polls on March 3. This is welcome news to the Surge. Early primary coverage feels so distant with its talk of endorsements, “war chests,” and other lifeless stats. Now we can cover proper knife fights down the stretch.

The prime drama of the week came in Texas’ competitive Senate Democratic primary between state Rep. James Talarico and U.S. Rep. Jasmine Crockett, of Dallas. It started when Morgan Thompson, a Texas TikTok personality, said that Talarico had told her privately “that he signed up to run against a mediocre Black man, not a formidable and intelligent Black woman.” The Black man in question is former Rep. Colin Allred, who ended his Senate campaign last year and switched to a House race. Allred then posted his own video response in which he endorsed Crockett and trashed Talarico, telling him, “If you want to compliment a Black woman, just do it. Just do it. Don’t do it while also tearing down a Black man.” For his part, Talarico said Thompson had offered a “mischaracterization” of his remark, and that he described only Allred’s “method of campaigning as mediocre.” (Not a particularly controversial observation there.)

National Republicans, who would prefer to run against the more polarizing, partisan figure in Crockett, have greatly enjoyed this all. It’s been a welcome distraction from their own Texas problems.

Our view of the Texas Senate race has been that it gets way too much attention for a contest that Republicans are probably going to win by 5 to 7 points. It’s not among the top pickup opportunities that national Democrats are targeting. Democrats haven’t won statewide there since 1994, and they seriously backslid in the state in 2024. It’s expensive to run in. There’s always a lot of temptation, every cycle, for Democrats to believe that this time could be different. It never materializes.

All of which is to say: It’s temptation time again! The national atmosphere is lousy for Republicans, the gains they made among Hispanic voters in 2024 to fortify their Texas standing are evaporating, Texas Republicans just got dusted in a special election in what they thought was a safe-red district, and, most importantly, they have candidate problems of their own. Incumbent Sen. John Cornyn, who would likely win reelection to his seat if he made it to November’s general, is in dreadful primary shape. After $50 million in advertising has been spent on his behalf, it’s still not clear that he’d make it to a runoff in his primary against Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton and Rep. Wesley Hunt. Even if he did make the runoff against Paxton, he’d likely be at a disadvantage. If Paxton, another partisan, polarizing figure laden with personal and professional baggage, becomes Republicans’ nominee, Democrats will feel the Texas temptation like never before.

We regret to say that at the rate she’s going, Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard is at risk of replacing Lindsey Graham as the Surge’s go-to “Here’s what they were up to this week” entry. Not a good sign for America. We’ve learned of late that Gabbard, who had been out of the public eye for a while, has been running her own investigation into the results of the 2020 election and sniffing around old ballots and voting machines. She was on the scene at an FBI raid of a Fulton County, Georgia, election center last week and, as we learned a few days ago, apparently called the president from Atlanta and put him on speakerphone with the agents who conducted the raid. None of this is within the DNI’s purview, all of it is wildly inappropriate at best, any of it would be a major scandal that Congress oversees immediately in a functioning government.

There is more. The Wall Street Journal reported this week that there’s a whistleblower complaint about Gabbard “that is so highly classified it has sparked months of wrangling over how to share it with Congress,” and that it’s “said to be locked in a safe.” A redacted version of the complaint, then, was finally made available to a select group of lawmakers later in the week, with executive privilege claims getting in the way of the good stuff. We shall see. Elsewhere in Gabland: It was reported that Gabbard “obtained” voting machines from Puerto Rico to play around with them and look for security vulnerabilities. OK!

The Washington Post eliminated about a third of its staff and hundreds of journalism jobs this week in the worst single-day massacre of expertise and talent we’ve ever seen—even in an industry that’s been contracting all century. The Post nixed its sports and books coverage, axed much of its arts coverage, and gutted its international and metro desks. It is now narrowly focused on District of Columbia news and politics, making it less a swaggering international newspaper than a publication whose purview matches Politico’s.

The Post has gone through highs and lows going back decades. Yet the acute mismanagement of the past couple of years by its owner, Jeff Bezos, after he’d lost any apparent interest in owning a newspaper, is staggering. Seeking to protect his business before the government ahead of a potential Trump win in 2024, Bezos barred the editorial board from making an endorsement in the presidential race, costing the paper hundreds of thousands of subscribers.

Individual mega-billionaires are under no obligation to use their largesse to subsidize public institutions like the Post forever. (A gentleman, though, might backfill at least the hole he personally created by interfering with the editorial board.) They’re not obligated to do so when it collides with their other business interests. We do think they’re obligated, however, to find someone who is willing to carry the task forward. Rather than destroy a public institution because it’s become a hassle in various ways, sell it to someone who gives a shit.

Senate Democrats got what they wanted in the government funding battle that ensued following the killing of Alex Pretti in Minneapolis. Rather than extend funding for the Department of Homeland Security through September, it would be extended for two weeks while Democrats and Republicans negotiated some new restraints over immigration enforcement. The Senate passed this rejiggered deal late last week, and the House muscled it through on Tuesday.

It is now Saturday, and the sum total of negotiating progress that has been made is nothing. Democratic congressional leaders Chuck Schumer and Hakeem Jeffries put out a list of 10 demands—among them no masks for DHS officers, no roving DHS patrols, no racial profiling—which was met coolly by Republicans. “Democrats’ newest proposal is a ridiculous Christmas list of demands for the press,” Alabama’s Katie Britt, Senate Republicans’ lead DHS appropriator, said. “They continue to play politics to their radical base at the expense of the safety of Americans.” Democrats, meanwhile, say they are being serious—and it’s the Republicans who aren’t! Et cetera, et cetera, and so on and so forth. The conversation has moved largely toward what the next short-term DHS funding patch will look like, because a bigger deal to rein in immigration authorities does not appear to be in the ballpark of imminent.

A marked push from the most conservative factions in the House and Senate to pass a major voter verification and ID bill has kicked off, but it’s hitting the same old wall: the Senate filibuster. The bill in question was, at first, the SAVE Act, legislation that would require showing “documentary proof of United States Citizenship” in order to register to vote. Now there’s a new version—the SAVE America Act—that tacks on a requirement for presenting photo ID at polling places. Senate Democrats are fully hostile to the legislation, with Schumer calling it “Jim Crow 2.0” and saying it’s about “federalizing voter suppression.”

In order to appease certain House conservatives who were threatening to hold up the government funding bill this week, Senate Majority Leader John Thune said he would at least have a conversation with his senators about how to proceed on the SAVE Act and its successors. One idea that’s come up, as it often does during desperate times, is to force the minority to stage a “talking filibuster” to stall it, and wait for them to exhaust their parliamentary options. Those never happen, and for good reason: It could eat up weeks or months of valuable Senate floor time and force Senate Republicans to be on or near the Senate floor for most of that time. This is one of those discussions we’d expect to naturally dissipate on its own once it becomes clear how unpalatable all of the options are. But depending on how involved Trump gets, Thune could have to withstand a lot of pressure.

The U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia finally said something cool this week, then got in trouble for it. “You bring a gun into the District, you mark my words, you’re going to jail,” Jeanine Pirro said in an appearance on her old stomping grounds at Fox News. “I don’t care if you have a license in another district, and I don’t care if you’re a law-abiding gun owner somewhere else.” This didn’t sit well with gun-rights groups, who were already displeased with the administration for the way it talked about how Alex Pretti, who was carrying lawfully, shouldn’t have brought his gun with him to protest immigration officers in Minnesota. Elected Republicans, too, criticized her, with Florida Rep. Greg Steube, for example, telling Pirro, “Come and Take it!”

As Steube said in his own post, though, he’s licensed in both Florida and D.C. to carry. No one, regrettably, is going to take away Greg Steube’s gun. “Let me be clear: I am a proud supporter of the Second Amendment,” Pirro said in a follow-up social media post. “Washington, D.C. law requires handguns be licensed in the District with the Metropolitan Police Department to be carried into our community. We are focused on individuals who are unlawfully carrying guns and will continue building on that momentum to keep our communities safe.” That’s just a simple explanation of D.C. law that it’s her job to enforce. So she’ll probably have to keep apologizing.

He is chair of Elias Law Group and founder of Democracy Docket.

In the past few weeks, Donald Trump’s election denialism has kicked into high gear, just as his poll numbers hit new lows. Elias tells us the FBI/DNI raid to seize ballots in Fulton County, Georgia, and Steve Bannon’s new threats to surround polling places with ICE officers in November, show an administration that is prototyping new mechanisms for election subversion and voter suppression. But the public has power in this scenario, especially if they start paying attention to elections and voting rights now, rather than the day before Nov. 3, 2026.

It’s been a bad habit for a long time, but it’s getting worse: President Donald Trump can’t utter a single statement without lying about his accomplishments or revealing, all too plainly, that self-glorification is what he cares about the most.

Take his post on social media Thursday, affirming—as was clear a few days earlier—that he was going to let New START, the last remaining nuclear arms control treaty between the United States and Russia, expire this week with barely a shrug.

He wrote: “Rather than extend ‘NEW START’ (a badly negotiated deal … that, aside from everything else, is being grossly violated), we should have our Nuclear Experts work on a new, improved, and modernized Treaty that can last long into the future.”

First, though the treaty—which was signed in 2011—no longer addresses all the salient issues of today’s nuclear landscape, it was in fact a brilliantly negotiated accord in its day, mandating the deepest cuts and tightest on-site-inspection clauses in arms-control history.

The real problem with New START, in Trump’s eyes, was the same problem that compelled him to denounce the Iran nuclear deal as “the worst deal ever” before he tore it up in 2018; he hates them because they were both signed by his loathed and envied predecessor, Barack Obama.

Russian President Vladimir Putin—who has, in fact, abided by New START’s numerical limits—proposed that he and Trump extend the accord by one year, but Trump declined. (The treaty allowed for a one-time five-year extension, which Putin and Joe Biden signed back in 2021, perhaps another reason—since he loathes Biden at least as much as he despises  Obama—Trump would rather scuttle the whole deal.)

Then, in this same social media post, for no reason at all (this is the bad habit that I cited at the start of this essay), Trump recites some fibs. For instance: “I completely rebuilt [our] Military in my First Term, including new and many refurbished nuclear weapons.”

This is untrue. Obama approved the development of new nuclear weapons for the entire “strategic Triad”: land-based intercontinental ballistic missiles, submarine-launched ballistic missiles, and bombers, as well as new warheads and cruise missiles. (Ironically, he agreed to this as a way of getting Senate hawks to ratify the New START treaty. He was also snookered into this compromise. He agreed to “replace or modernize” the existing arsenal, thinking “modernize” could mean, for instance, upgrading the software on a guidance system. The senators took the term to be synonymous with “replace.”)

During his first term, Trump didn’t add a single new nuclear weapon or accelerate the ones that Obama put in motion. In fact, the first model of the new B-21 bomber took its first flight  during Biden’s presidency.

Trump’s social media post goes on: “I … continue to rebuild our Military at levels never seen before.”

This is palpably untrue. The Pentagon is, by some measures, spending more money than almost ever before, but building—of ships, planes, missiles, or whatever—is not growing so much; it’s dwarfed by the rearmament during World War II or the presidencies of John F. Kennedy and Ronald Reagan.

He rambles on: “We are even adding Battleships, which are 100 times more powerful than the ones that roamed the Seas during World War II.”

This is Trump’s big fantasy, stemming from romanticized memories of watching Victory at Sea, the WWII documentary on TV. But no naval officer wants to revive such relics, and it’s extremely unlikely the gigantic boats will ever be built.

Then came this puzzler: “I have stopped Nuclear Wars from breaking out across the World between Pakistan and India, Iran and Israel, and Russia and Ukraine.”

One might have thought Trump had done enough distorting of his record as peacemaker by claiming that he’d “ended eight-plus wars” (most of which either haven’t yet ended or were ended by actors other than Trump). But this new boast, that he’d “stopped Nuclear Wars from breaking out” shows him engaging in new realms of self-delusion.

The latest round of skirmishes between India and Pakistan hardly escalated at all, much less to the brink of nuclear exchanges, before the fighting stopped. (When Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi scoffed at Trump’s earlier claim of credit for negotiating the peace, Trump slapped him with 50 percent tariffs, a step he has since reversed.)

Nuclear war between Iran and Israel wasn’t remotely in the offing, in part because Iran doesn’t have nuclear weapons. Maybe Trump was thinking that his bombing campaign, which he claimed “obliterated” Iran’s nuclear program, preempted this possibility. But now satellite images reveal that Iran is repairing the damage done, suggesting he didn’t obliterate the sites after all.

As for Russia and Ukraine, one could argue that by halting weapons deliveries to Ukraine, Trump thwarted Ukraine’s counteroffensive, thus calming Putin’s fear of losing the war, a prospect he might have blocked by going nuclear—but the logical thread is dubious, and in any case this was an act of appeasement, not peace.

Then, Trump returns to New START. Rather than extending it for a year, he writes, “we should have our Nuclear Experts work on a new, improved, and modernized Treaty that can last long into the future.”

Ah, yes, a “better” New START, just as Trump talked about a “better” Iran nuclear deal back in 2018 after he ripped up the accord signed by the dread Barack Obama. But he never even tried to negotiate an improved Iran deal; he was hoping, perhaps assuming, that his campaign of “maximum pressure” would bring down Tehran’s regime. (It didn’t; it only accelerated its nuclear program.) It’s unclear what he’s aiming for in refusing to extend New START, but it’s just as unlikely he’ll initiate new strategic arms talks, in part because his administration has no “Nuclear Experts,” none with experience at negotiating arms treaties anyway.

A few days before Trump nailed the coffin on New START, Axios reported that the U.S. and Russia were “closing in on a deal” to extend the treaty. The story further reported that the idea had been proposed, at a recent meeting with Russian diplomats, by Jared Kushner and Steve Witkoff. And why not? Trump has been using this overmatched duo—his son-in-law and his fellow real-estate tycoon—as stand-ins for foreign service officers, gallivanting the globe, trying to make peace deals in Ukraine (fruitless), Gaza (Stage 1 but nothing more), and other hotspots. They know nothing about the old Russian Empire or the Middle East, so why not try their untutored hands at nuclear arms–control talks too? Trump rejected the idea for now, but if he does start new ones, he’ll probably send them to the table.

In any case, New START’s impending expiration has been flashing on the horizon ever since Trump was sworn in for a second term. If he was really serious about negotiating a new, improved treaty, he could have started doing so months ago.

But Trump isn’t interested in the issues, not just on arms control but in general. The most recent case in point—and also the latest chapter in Trump’s quest for immortality—is a report that, during recent talks with Sen. Chuck Schumer, Trump said that he would restore the $16 billion that he’d withdrawn from the Gateway Tunnel—a project to connect New York and New Jersey—if Penn Station and Dulles Airport were renamed after him. (Schumer nixed the notion.)

That says it all. Trump had pretended that he’d killed the tunnel—along with its jobs and improvements in infrastructure—to save money. But in fact, it was all about political punishment (denying funds to blue states) and personal glory (restoring the money for glimmers of immortality).

Trump wants to emblazon his name on as many grand monuments as he can before he shuffles off this mortal coil: the Trump-Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, the Trump Institute of Peace, the plans for a new 250-foot-high arch off the Memorial Bridge (the Arc de Trump?), the Trump-class battleships, and so forth.

It’s pathetic. He is the most powerful man on earth, he has tremendous wealth (embellished by $4 billion through his leveraging since retaking the White House). Yet he needs to have his name carved, mounted, blared, memorialized, somehow noticed, everywhere.

He seems unaware that all the other presidential commemorations—JFK Airport, Cape Kennedy, the USS Gerald Ford, Reagan National Airport, the city of Washington, D.C., and all the rest—were set down, or renamed, after their honorees had left public life, in most cases after they died. They were signs of a nation’s respect, or at least wistful nostalgia. The Trump christenings are garish reflections of tawdry egomania.

Many of these monuments will be re-renamed, the gold letters stripped off their walls, soon after Trump leaves office. It will be harder to repair his calamitous policies.

Thursday night, Donald Trump posted something racist enough to break through on social media—a rarity, as his offensive social media posts often go ignored these days. But the visceral, undeniable racism of this particular iteration, and the White House’s initial refusal to express any remorse, pushed it through. And at least one Republican senator expressed disapproval: Sen. Tim Scott, who is Black, called it “the most racist thing I’ve seen out of this White House.”

The source of all this commotion was a screengrab of a video Trump posted on Truth Social depicting the heads of former first lady Michelle Obama and former President Barack Obama laughing, open-mouthed, on ape bodies.

The screengrab is real, and the underlying video it comes from is stranger than one might expect. Trump posted the video on Truth Social at 8:44 p.m. on Thursday, and it’s actually largely about election fraud, taking you through baseless and frankly dull conspiracy theory material. But at the end, for about two seconds, it flashes to a bright jungle scene, featuring the laughing Obamas, to the tune of “The Lion Sleeps Tonight.”

The last two seconds appeared to be clipped into the video for shock humor, meant to throw a laugh in for the racists who had made it all the way through. There is no mitigating “context” here. With or without the election-fraud part, it was the Black president and first lady, depicted as apes, in one of the oldest and most dehumanizing racist tropes in history.

At first, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt tried to defend the post as being “from an internet meme video depicting President Trump as the king of the Jungle and Democrats as characters from The Lion King.” She added: “Please stop the fake outrage and report on something today that actually matters to the American public.”

And, sure, the original video that those bizarre last seconds were taken from does indeed show Trump as a lion and Democrats as figures that could conceivably be thought of as Lion King characters—Hillary Clinton as Pumbaa, Hakeem Jeffries as Timon—bowing to him. But there are no ape characters in the Lion King. The video is generated by A.I., and is not in the animated style of the 1993 animated film but is instead standard A.I. slop. Perhaps the A.I. added in the additional characters to muddle the racism of depicting the Obamas as apes, but the fact remains that it opens with the scene of the Obamas, and lingers on it longer than the others.

And the creator of the video is not known for his delicacy or tact. Per the watermark and his own claims on X, the creator, who has Pepe the Frog for an avatar, is the same internet user behind the infamous October slop video of Trump dumping sewage onto protesters from a fighter jet. That video shocked people for its raw animosity toward legal protesters practicing their First Amendment rights, as well as for the profoundly juvenile behavior from a sitting president. If you scroll through the creator’s more recent material, it appears he pretty much exclusively makes similarly mindless, low-quality slop content with obvious MAGA messages. Other videos have included Tom Homan as a Jedi fighting protesters in Minneapolis; Don Lemon being arrested and twerking in prison; and Alex Pretti, who was fatally shot by Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents, being hit with a car and thrown, cartoonishly, into the air.

Even if the original video had no racist intent, which it does, defending the original video makes no sense: Trump didn’t post the original video. He posted a two-second clip of the Obamas as apes. The message is clear.

The one valid defense would be one of ignorance. We can’t know exactly how Trump encountered this video. It’s unclear if Trump watched the entire clip, meaning maybe he didn’t see those two seconds at the end. The White House claimed it was a staffer who actually posted it. But given the highly nonstrategic style of the account’s posting that evening—another post was of an inoffensive TikTok featuring a dog eager to be fed whipped cream, classic Trump stuff—it seems a strange kind of post for a staffer.

Much more crucially, the White House left the video up once they learned of the racist section. Trump did not apologize. The White House did eventually take it down, but only after it had been up for 12 hours.

Trump has done and said many other aggressively anti-Black things in his years in the public eye; this video is not the worst. But it still says something profound about the president and his administration that they were made aware of thoroughly ugly racism coming from the president’s own messages and chose not to apologize to Black Americans or correct the error, but instead to turn against the public.

Amid the uproar over President Donald Trump’s assault on Minnesota’s immigrant communities, another abuse has drawn less attention: a brazen disregard for judicial limits on his deportation campaign. The courts have determined that in January alone the administration violated at least 96 orders in 74 cases challenging the unlawful detention of immigrants in Minneapolis. The Justice Department has failed to meet its most basic obligations in many of these cases, due to an apparent combination of malice, incompetence, and institutional depletion. Further evidence of its unraveling came on Tuesday, when Julie Le, a government attorney, told Judge Jerry Blackwell, in open court: “I wish you would just hold me in contempt, Your Honor, so that I can have a full 24 hours of sleep.” Of the backlog in Minneapolis, Le then told Blackwell: “What do you want me to do? The system sucks. This job sucks. And I am trying every breath that I have so that I can get you what you need.”

On this week’s Slate Plus bonus episode of Amicus, co-hosts Dahlia Lithwick and Mark Joseph Stern discussed Le’s shocking courtroom breakdown and what it reveals about the DOJ’s broader meltdown under Trump’s impossible demands. A preview of their conversation, below, has been edited and condensed for clarity.

Dahlia Lithwick: Is this the clearest sign yet that for all of its tough talk about going to “war” with “rogue judges,” the DOJ under Trump is in full-on dumpster-fire crisis mode?

Mark Joseph Stern: It’s a sign that the Justice Department is actively collapsing. And it’s important to understand the background here. Blackwell had ordered Le to explain why the government failed to comply with his order demanding the release of a detained immigrant, as well as why she shouldn’t be personally held in contempt for defying that order. Her response was that she had been given an impossible task. It turned out that the Trump administration had assigned her to the U.S. attorney’s office to handle 88 immigration cases in under a month, a crushing load. That overwhelming surge of immigration cases is happening all over the country, but it’s especially acute in Minneapolis because of the ongoing crackdown on immigrant communities there.

But this is a problem entirely of the administration’s own making. Back in July, the government unilaterally reinterpreted federal immigration law to require the detention of any immigrant who was never legally admitted into the country, rather than allowing them to be released and given a bond hearing. So even if they have lawful presence today, they must be detained indefinitely. As our friend Chris Geidner explained at Law Dork, courts have overwhelmingly rejected that reinterpretation: More than 350 decisions by 160 different judges in about 50 different courts have all found that that interpretation is obviously wrong. But because the Supreme Court took away universal injunctions in the birthright citizenship case in its most recent term, no single court can block the government from enforcing this position nationwide, so it keeps trying, over and over again.

That means the government is illegally detaining thousands of immigrants based on an egregious misreading of the law. Those immigrants are flooding the courts with habeas petitions for release. There were 581 habeas cases in Minnesota in January alone—an exponential increase of unmanageable proportions. The courts are overwhelmingly granting these petitions, but then the immigrants are not being released, because the DOJ doesn’t have enough lawyers on hand to process all of the rulings and ensure that Immigration and Customs Enforcement is actually releasing people. So that is the background that led this attorney, Le, to have a breakdown in court and say: I am unable to do the job that has been asked of me.

I want to flag that this isn’t a factual dispute. It’s not a legal dispute. It’s not a pound-on-the-table dispute. It’s a decision by the Justice Department to not have enough lawyers, and to make the system collapse under the weight of indifference and apathy. Since Trump’s second inauguration, you and I have talked a lot about judges who are mad, frustrated, and venting at Trump lawyers. This is something different. It’s scaled up massively. This is an admonition from a judge saying that the entire system of justice cannot be sustained this way, and he is watching it veer off the rails.

You see that in something else Blackwell said on Tuesday: “Having what you feel are too many detainees, too many cases, too many deadlines, and not enough infrastructure to keep up with it all is not a defense to continued detention. If anything, it ought to be a warning sign.” He’s saying the government cannot create a crisis by detaining way too many immigrants illegally, then claim that it is too overwhelmed to comply with orders releasing those immigrants. That is such a vital point for a judge to make when we know that the Trump administration’s strategy is always Flood the zone. Shock and awe. Inundate the opposition with an endless blitz. And in a very real sense here, the opposition is the judiciary. It’s judges like Blackwell who are willing to stand up and say: This is illegal. You are not allowed to do this.

This is the same DOJ that’s out there on X, advertising for lawyers. Chad Mizelle, former DOJ chief of staff, literally tweeted last month: “If you are a lawyer, are interested in being an AUSA, and support President Trump and anti-crime agenda, DM me.” This isn’t freaking Dairy Queen! But one way to destroy an institution from within is to create a crisis, right? They created a crisis with the immigration sweeps. Then they created a double crisis by saying, “Well, Justice Department lawyers just can’t handle all the work.” It’s a way of signaling that the whole institution is broken.

And that’s the point. If it’s understood that DOJ lawyers suck and there’s nothing a judge can do to enforce his will, the takeaway for the public is: I guess the justice system doesn’t matter. I guess the Constitution doesn’t matter. So Julie Le freaking out in open court doesn’t get us where we need to go. We need to take the next step, which is to say that they are breaking systems and exulting in it. And that’s the part that we are not reckoning with.

I agree. These assistant U.S. attorney positions used to be super prestigious and competitive. They were a launchpad to an elite career in the law. Now Trump officials are basically pleading with people to apply for them by DM on Elon Musk’s Nazi-hangout site. There has been a mass exodus from the Justice Department—thousands of attorneys have fled since Trump returned to office. And of course the White House has purged almost every lawyer who worked on Jan. 6 cases on top of that. And now the administration can’t fill these positions. But this was the inevitable consequence of Trump’s abolishing the traditional independence of the DOJ. The department now works directly for him, including the prosecution of his political adversaries.

On top of that, the attorneys who remain in their positions have to defend these unlawful detentions, racist arrests, and other unconstitutional behavior. They’re being pulled off actual criminal cases to prosecute immigrants instead. Real violent crimes are going unprosecuted so that the deportation machine can be fed. It would take an army of immigration lawyers to handle all of this work that the DOJ has now created for itself. And nobody with a conscience wants to do this stuff. I want to quote another thing Le said in the courtroom, after Blackwell asked her about the government snatching people up in Minnesota, flying them to a detention center across the country, then not bringing them back for hearings. Le said: “I share the same concern with you, Your Honor. I am not white, as you can see, and my family’s at risk as any other people that might get picked up too. So I share the same concern, and I took that concern to heart.”

Here is a lawyer saying: Wait, what am I doing here? Why am I defending these racist policies? I shouldn’t be here either. My own family is at risk because of the policies that I’m defending. When that kind of breakdown of the system is happening in open court, of course there aren’t enough lawyers to do all of this work, because only the most racist, nativist freaks will remain. And there aren’t enough good lawyers who are also racist freaks to carry all of the weight that the DOJ is putting on itself.

To that end, we should note that Le has reportedly been removed from her post. But I think that the point we’re both trying to make is that we learned this lesson from Elon Musk, right? The easiest way to decimate government functioning is to decimate government itself. And so this is an act of contempt, but it’s also an act of power. It’s saying: You can’t make me, and I don’t care.

            <h2>Whether they are building agents or folding proteins, LLMs need a friend</h2>
            <p><strong>The Register | 2026-02-07</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2026/02/07/ai_companion_bots_vishal_sikka_interview/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">interview Don&#39;t trust; verify. According to AI researcher Vishal Sikka, LLMs alone are limited by computational boundaries and will start to hallucinate when they push those boundaries. One solution? Companion bots that check their work.

“To expect that a model that has been trained on a certain amount of data will be able to do an arbitrarily large number of calculations which are reliable is a wrong assumption. This is the point of the paper,” said Sikka, CEO of Vianai Systems during a call this week to discuss that research.

Sikka is a towering figure in AI. He has a PhD in the subject from Stanford, where his student advisor was John McCarthy, the man who in 1955 coined the term “artificial intelligence.” Lessons Sikka learned from McCarthy inspired him to team up with his son and write a study, “Hallucination Stations: On Some Basic Limitations of Transformer-Based Language Models,” which was published in July. The former CTO of SAP and ex-CEO of Infosys, Sikka set out to study the efficacy of LLMs and AI agents last year.

“We have an example my son came up with of two prompts that have identical tokens and when you run them, the exact same number of operations get performed independent of what the tokens are,” he said. “Therein is the entire point, that whether the prompt is expressing the user&#39;s desire to perform a particular calculation or the prompt is expressing a user&#39;s desire to write a piece of text on something, it does exactly the same number of calculations.”

Attempting to push an LLM beyond that limit gives rise to the hallucinations that bedevil the model&#39;s output.

“When we say, ‘Go book a ticket for me and then charge my credit card or deduct the amount from my bank and then send a post to my financial app,’ which is what all these agent vendors are kind of saying, you are asking the agents to perform an action which holds a meaning to you, which holds a particular semantic to you, and if it is a pure LLM underneath there, no matter how that LLM works, it has a bounded ability to carry out these kinds of tasks,” he said. “So with agentic use of pure LLMs, you have to perform extreme caution when you do these kinds of things.”

But, Sikka – who founded Vianai in 2019 – said that, when LLMs are supported by systems that can verify the work and use the foundation model only for the computational power, the output becomes more accurate. Sikka said that, in the case of Vianai’s Hila, it can perform mission-critical tasks such as reducing financial reporting from 20 days of human labor to five minutes.

“For certain domains, when you surround the LLM with guardrails, with reliable approaches that are proven, then you are able to provide reliability in the overall system,” he said. “It&#39;s not only us. A lot of systems out there work like that where they pair the LLM with another system which is able to ensure that the LLM has correctness. So we do that in our product Hila. We combine the LLM with a knowledge model for a particular domain and then, after that, Hila does not make mistakes.”

Sikka compared it to the structure Google uses to identify proteins that could be used to make medicines. Google’s AlphaFold has a custom LLM called Evoformer that creates candidates for proteins and that is fed into another “non imaginative” system that can check the configuration for flaws.

“And so anything that comes out of that has a much higher likelihood of being an actual protein, and then it repeats this cycle three times, and the outcome of that is pretty much guaranteed to be a protein for a particular situation,” Sikka said. “They have produced, I think 250,000 proteins that way, which, producing one protein used to take teams of scientists years to do that.”

He continued, “As to ‘why?’ as a scientist you always have to try and understand the boundaries of a technique. Some call it the ‘overview effect.’ John McCarthy used to call it ‘circumscription.’ He also named a set of AI techniques for this, to try and build systems with circumscription,” Sikka said. “Plus of course, Gen AI hallucinates, so ‘Why?’ is a natural question to ask. And finally, since the beginning of Vianai we were working on bringing in explainability, observability, and transparency to AI systems.”

During The Register’s conversation with Sikka, he dropped nuggets of wisdom he picked up first hand from other tech pioneers, like Alan Kay and Marvin Minsky.

“Marvin Minsky used to say the Society of Mind, right?” Sikka said referring to the phrase that was the title of Minsky’s influential 1986 book about human intelligence that was based on his work with AI. “That there is a collection of things that come together to create intelligence. I think that’s kind of where we will end up, but we’ll stumble along our way through to that.”

Minsky actually wrote a letter of recommendation that helped Sikka reach Stanford. While the letter remains somewhere in the admissions office in California, Minsky’s nudge has given Sikka an unobstructed view of AI’s development since the 1980s.

“This is my fourth time observing this AI mania in my career,” Sikka said. “In the 80s, there was a whole hype that came and went over a decade. Same thing (as now). Custom hardware. Custom silicon for AI. AI models. Foundation applications. There were even venture firms being formed to fund AI. There were companies with names like Thinking Machines, Applied Intelligence. It was a different time and different technique. Then people realized this is cool, but it&#39;s not intelligence. It has a certain boundary of applications and then it kind of died.”

Despite spending more than 40 years with AI, Sikka said that even now the technology is in its early stages. While there have been notable successes with coding, he pointed to the MIT study that revealed 95 percent of AI projects fail and compared the current use of AI to the early days of television news when anchors would read updates over the air, just as they had done with radio.

“I think so far, we are just regurgitating our prior known things using AI, but soon we will see breakthrough, new things that are possible,” he said. “I think with carefully chosen products, there is dramatic return on investment to be had, but a blanket use of LLMs, you have to be very, very careful.” ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">A growing body of research continues to show that older workers are generally more productive than younger employees.

Annie Coleman, founder of consultancy RealiseLongevity, analyzed the data and highlighted a 2025 study finding peak performance occurs between the ages of 55-60.

Writing in the Stanford Center on Longevity blog, she cited research examining 16 cognitive markers that confirm that although processing speed declines after early adulthood, other dimensions improve, and overall cognition peaks near retirement age.

Studies from the past 15 years show that some qualities like vigilance may worsen with age alongside processing speed, but others improve, including the ability to avoid distractions and accumulated knowledge.

These factors matter more as AI starts to eliminate jobs for grads and entry-level candidates, increasing the value of experienced workers who can mentor other employees.

A 2022 meta-analysis concluded that professional teams tend to function better when they have company veterans among them, as did Bank of America&#39;s findings [PDF] two years later.

Likewise, a Boston Consulting Group study in 2022 showed age-diverse teams outperformed homogeneous ones, with the best results coming when older workers&#39; judgment combined with younger employees&#39; digital skills.

So, in a working world that seemingly values youthful forward thinkers over experience – illustrated by the various age discrimination lawsuits across the tech industry – the current data shows organizations should be doing everything they can to keep their older staffers.

&quot;In meeting their responsibility for long-term risk and growth, companies should begin with clarity. Map the age profile of the workforce by role and seniority,&quot; Coleman wrote. &quot;Identify where people in their fifties and early sixties are exiting, and whether those exits reflect performance or design. Treat age as a strategic variable in the same way firms now treat gender, skills, or succession risk.

&quot;Build roles and career paths that assume longer working lives. Invest in mid- and late-career reskilling, not as remediation but as renewal. Structure intergenerational teams deliberately, so experience and speed compound rather than collide. Align product, service, and brand strategy with the realities of an aging, wealthier customer base.

&quot;None of this is about altruism. It is about reclaiming value currently being left on the table.&quot; ®

            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2026/02/07/openreach_ptsn_hikes/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Openreach is warning British businesses that the old phone network shuts down in less than a year, with half a million commercial lines still unmigrated.

BT Group&#39;s infrastructure arm is switching to an all-digital, IP-based service over fiber. To speed migration, it&#39;s hiking charges on legacy products.

Deadlines for the cutoff have slipped several times, but the telecoms giant is now bent on finally burying the copper-based public switched telephone network (PSTN) by January 31, 2027, and Openreach is already working to kill off any services that use it.

Those products come under the umbrella term of Wholesale Line Rental (WLR), and Openreach stopped selling them nationwide in 2023 to prepare the way.

Openreach claims all technical barriers to migration – including protections for vulnerable telecare users – are resolved and the deadline is &quot;locked in,&quot; so BT customers need to make sure they are ready.

Biz customers are being offered special pricing on migrations to SOGEA (Single Order Generic Ethernet Access – basically broadband without a phone service). And to reinforce the message, Openreach is about to start upping charges to service providers and companies still operating legacy business lines. From April 1, prices will rise 20 percent. Come July 1, they will go up a further 40 percent.

From October 1, there will be another 40 percent hike, meaning that any businesses still holding out will then pay double the rental cost for their legacy lines compared to last year.

This will be your final wake-up call before PSTN is terminated in January. Any customer that hasn&#39;t made the switch by then will lose service altogether.

&quot;The PSTN analog network is obsolete, becoming harder to maintain and significantly more expensive to run,&quot; claimed Openreach Director of All-IP James Lilley.

&quot;We are passing those costs on to providers who continue to sell legacy products. If your business is still on this copper service, you will start to pay a premium for a service that will be switched off,&quot; he added.

&quot;Most major communications providers moved their customers to digital long ago. If your provider hasn&#39;t contacted you, you need to ask why.&quot;

Lilley claimed Openreach spent the last year ensuring telecare customers can be switcherd via a &quot;Prove Telecare&quot; service. This was one of the reasons for delays to the switch-off date.

Openreach says it is trying to ensure service providers can migrate vulnerable customers using fixed-line telecare devices, such as health-related alarms, to new digital or IP voice services.

Yet some domestic customers, especially older citizens, do not have broadband and don&#39;t want it. The Register was previously assured these users will not be switched to a digital line &quot;until they are able to.&quot;

This involves a pre-digital phone line (PDPL) service where equipment is installed in the local telephone exchange to allow them to continue to use their old phone line as before.

This is only intended to provide &quot;interim connectivity&quot; until sometime around 2030, when customers will be required to move over to Digital Voice or an alternative.

Openreach told us there are several possibilities for consumers without broadband. If there is fiber available to the property, customers will likely be migrated to SOGEA, and given a router to plug their phone into.

If fiber isn&#39;t available, they will likely be switched to SOTAP for Analogue (Single Order Transitional Access Product), a digital service that works in the exchange and emulates a PSTN line (see PDPL above).

If a customer does nothing, Openreach says they will most likely end up on its Emergency Voice Access (EVAC), a &quot;no frills&quot; version of SOTAP.

Customers are advised to contact their service provider to ensure they continue to receive their phone service. ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The first rule of AI-generated job loss is you don&#39;t talk about AI-generated job loss ... if you&#39;re the company that caused it. Higgsfield.ai, a startup offering AI video creation tools, recently generated outrage when it claimed it had caused artists to hit the unemployment line.

Earlier this week, the company bragged on X that its AI motion design tool put an end to more than 20 creative jobs.

The artists using its services – well aware of AI&#39;s impact on the creative market and perhaps discomfitted by their complicity for using these tools – were not amused and the ensuing backlash on social media led to the post&#39;s removal.

&quot;Seems like Higgsfield found out today that there are lines they just shouldn&#39;t cross in their marketing,&quot; wrote Aharon Rabinowitz, CEO of Motion Management, in a social media post. &quot;Celebrating the end of artists&#39; careers (even when their motion design tools are not actually good enough to render anyone unemployed) is just super dumb and shortsighted.&quot;

The company&#39;s marketing claims and the services it actually provides have been a matter of contention for several months. Online critics have accused the company of:

As one online critic put it, &quot;Higgsfield AI: A Company Built on Rage Bait Content, Stolen Likenesses, and Sexual Exploitation.&quot; Another has accused Higgsfield of commissioning customers to create marketing material using unlicensed intellectual property, to shift liability for potential infringement claims.

Higgsfield did not respond to requests for comment. A message to the company&#39;s email address for the press, cited in prior fundraising news, bounced. A message to the company&#39;s support email address said our inquiry had been forwarded to a human agent, but no one has followed up.

The Register also asked Menlo Ventures, one of the companies funding Higgsfield, to comment. A spokesperson for the VC firm did not comment as asked but provided a media contact who has yet to respond.

Ian Hudson, a UK-based software tester and video maker, spoke to The Register in a phone interview about the backlash against Higgsfield.

&quot;The problem seems to be that really they aren&#39;t providing much of a service themselves and it appears that a lot of the website really is just a wrapper for other services,&quot; Hudson explained. &quot;So it&#39;s doing API calls off to Google for Nano Banana and it&#39;s using a service called Kling for the video.&quot;

Hudson said that he became aware of the service in January because of the company&#39;s intensive marketing efforts. Higgsfield, he said, has been making promises about unlimited usage of services like Google Nano Banana and Kling.

&quot;But there&#39;s no explanation so you don&#39;t really know what&#39;s going on,&quot; he said. &quot;Either something&#39;s unlimited or it&#39;s not, but it turns out it&#39;s not unlimited. Really you&#39;re not getting anything unlimited, you&#39;re getting a quick trial of it. And then it turns out that&#39;s got terms and conditions [that say] if you do a lot of use of it, we&#39;ll ban you.&quot;

Hudson said Higgsfield puts user prompts in a queue that gets delayed for an arbitrary amount of time before being routed to the underlying third-party AI service.

&quot;So it appears to be unlimited, but then it&#39;s not because it&#39;s throttling things for so long to get a result back that you get a fraction of what you could get if you went to, say, Google Gemini directly,&quot; he explained. &quot;So it&#39;s not really a service that is fit for purpose.&quot;

Hudson also criticized the company for its approach to marketing, which he said involved making controversial posts to generate attention and drama, and then deleting the posts to hide the evidence.

And he took issue with the limitations imposed on refunds. Higgsfield, he said, refuses to give refunds if you&#39;ve used their services.

&quot;So essentially nobody can get a refund because the only way you can get a refund is if you don&#39;t touch the bleeding thing and work out if it actually works,&quot; he said, &quot;which as you can appreciate, that&#39;s just fundamentally unfair. And this is where the credit card companies are falling down because the credit card companies say, &#39;oh well we&#39;ve looked at terms and conditions and they&#39;re adhering to terms and conditions.&#39;&quot;

These sorts of complaints are rife on social media and in the company&#39;s Discord channel. A post on Thursday states, &quot;...it is evident that your marketing is deceptive and your service is non-functional.&quot;

The post goes on to complain about service unavailability, unacceptable latency (4-10 hours of wait time for a five-minute video), censorship errors, and false marketing.

Hudson took issue with the company&#39;s engagement-bait marketing strategy.

&quot;A lot of people go &#39;isn&#39;t it awesome that they&#39;re doing that!&#39;&quot; he said. &quot;No it&#39;s not. It&#39;s childish and it&#39;s unprofessional. But what they&#39;ve done in the last few days, it said something like, &#39;Our product&#39;s so great we&#39;ve been able to sack off twenty creators.&#39; Something along those lines. And because their entire community is creators, a lot of them got upset.&quot;

Robert Scoble, an internet influencer since before that was really a term, claimed in a social media post that he spoke with an individual behind the Higgsfield influencer network last week.

&quot;This guy is trying to capture attention in a world where none of us have any,&quot; he mused.

To quote Oscar Wilde in The Picture of Dorian Gray, &quot;There is only one thing in the world worse than being talked about, and that is not being talked about.&quot;

Bankruptcy, moral or financial, is pretty bad too. ®

            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2026/02/06/darpa_seeking_physicsdefying_photonic_computers/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">It&#39;s no lightweight matter. DARPA is putting about $35 million in total funding on the table in the hope that it will spur researchers to work around fundamental physical constraints and build much larger-scale photonic circuits that do more of the computing with light, not electronics.

A recent solicitation from the Department of Defense&#39;s research arm - the Photonic Integrated Circuit Architectures for Scalable System Objectives (PICASSO) - aims to scale photonics beyond today’s narrow demonstrations. Citing the need for more capable photonic systems, including those relevant to artificial intelligence workloads, DARPA is calling on researchers to submit proposals showing how circuit-level design can overcome the fundamental limitations that constrain current photonic computing approaches, using today’s photonic components rather than waiting for new ones to be invented.

For those unfamiliar with photonic computing, it&#39;s the use of light instead of electrons to process and transmit data. If that sounds far-fetched, it&#39;s not, as DARPA points out - there are already photonic circuits around today, albeit in limited form.

Using light to process data signals has advantages that are ideal for heavy workloads like AI due to greater bandwidth, less latency, and improved energy efficiency. Unfortunately, as DARPA points out, &quot;systems incorporating photonic circuits struggle to show significant system-level performance advantages over electronic systems.&quot;

The current generation of photonic circuits is limited in depth, which restricts their ability to do much beyond single linear mathematical operations. Individual photonic circuits included in larger systems also have to convert optical signals to electronic ones in order to hand them off to other components, essentially eliminating the advantage of nanosecond latency due to the millisecond latency of electronic circuits, which DARPA notes is a 106 performance degradation.

So, what&#39;s holding photonic circuits back aside from, according to DARPA, an industry focus on component-level research? Why, just physics of course.

&quot;The primary limitation to further scaling of circuit size and functionality is rooted in the fundamental properties of signaling with light,&quot; DARPA noted. Cool - easy fix, provided researchers can address the two fundamental technical challenges the research organization points out.

First there&#39;s signal degradation. Unlike metal-oxide-semiconductor circuits, which regenerate signals and filter out noise, photonic circuits have a fundamental issue of optical attenuation and noise that can&#39;t be amplified out, as any attempt to amplify optical signals also amplifies the noise.

Second, there&#39;s the issue of spurious wave interference, which leads to scattering, coupling, mode leakage, back reflections, and unwanted resonance. &quot;Over many components, control of these errors becomes unpredictable, especially when combined with manufacturing variability and thermal and environmental instabilities,&quot; DARPA explained.

Overcoming those limitations, as mentioned above, has traditionally resulted in photonic circuits being interfaced with electronic ones, and DARPA doesn&#39;t want that.

&quot;Heavy usage of electronics prevents system-level gains in latency, efficiency, and bandwidth offered natively by photonics,&quot; the agency said.

Here&#39;s where PICASSO comes in: What DARPA wants from its chosen participants is, like resolving the limitations imposed by the physics of light, simple: Just make better circuits so those two technical challenges aren&#39;t an issue anymore.

&quot;Drawing inspiration from modern electronics, in which clever circuit design overcomes the limitations of individual transistors, the program will foster innovative circuit-level strategies to achieve unprecedented system performance and stability,&quot; DARPA said. &quot;PICASSO confronts these challenges by embracing a new paradigm: creating tomorrow&#39;s photonic circuits using today&#39;s components.&quot;

DARPA isn&#39;t just soliciting ideas, either. By the time PICASSO phase 1 wraps up, 18 months after it kicks off in July, DARPA wants a &quot;demonstration of predictable performance of photonic circuits,&quot; and by the end of phase 2 (an additional 18 month period), it expects &quot;generalized circuit functionality&quot; to be demonstrated.

It also expects all that within a total program budget of about $35 million, spread across multiple awards. Proposals are due by March 6 - good luck. ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Four tech megacorps intend to collectively fork out roughly $635 billion this year on capex, much of it for datacenters and AI infrastructure – more than the entire output of Israel&#39;s economy and well beyond all global cloud infrastructure services revenue generated last year.

The tech titans are all trying to outdo each other by spending eye-watering amounts on capex, the majority of which will go on AI and cloud expansion, but the big four – AWS, Microsoft, Google and Meta – are investing at a different scale.

Amazon says it expects to spend $200 billion in 2026, with most of that headed to AWS. Google is aiming to pump $180 billion into building and equipping datacenters, while Meta expects capex in the range of $115 billion to $135 billion, and Microsoft is running at a pace that implies around $120 billion a year in spending.

That adds up to $635 billion, more than the $610 billion that represented Israel&#39;s entire gross domestic product during 2025, and approaching that of Sweden at $662 billion, according to figures from the IMF.

These extraordinary sums show how far the industry leaders are willing to go to gain some kind of advantage in the AI race, even though returns on all the spending have so far failed to live up to expectations, and investors are reportedly getting restless. Microsoft&#39;s share price fell about 10 percent after its recent results were announced, for example, due to investors expecting a bigger payoff.

The wider cost for users? The massive splurge on infrastructure is driving shortages of components like memory as manufacturers prioritize chip production that cashes in on the lucrative datacenter market, rather than those for everyday PCs and phones.

The huge capex pledges also add up to more than total cloud infrastructure services revenue in 2025. According to the latest figures from Synergy Research Group, the revenues reached $419 billion last year.

This is despite the cloud market itself continuing to grow at an impressive pace, running at about 30 percent year-on-year and marking a ninth consecutive quarter of accelerating growth.

&quot;GenAI has simply put the cloud market into overdrive,&quot; said Synergy Research Group chief analyst John Dinsdale. &quot;AI-specific services account for much of the growth since 2022, but AI technology has also enhanced the broader portfolio of cloud services, driving revenue growth across the board. The leading cloud providers have all seen their revenue growth rates jump.&quot;

The big three clouds continue to dominate with Synergy putting their shares of the worldwide market in Q4 2025 at 28 percent for Amazon (AWS), 21 percent for Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud at 14 percent.

Among the tier-two cloud providers, those with the highest growth rates include CoreWeave, Oracle, Crusoe, and Nebius, all providers of AI infrastructure services. In particular, CoreWeave is now generating more than $1.5 billion in quarterly cloud revenue and has joined the top ten cloud providers, Synergy says. ®

It’s the first weekend of February, which can only mean one thing: The Super Bowl (or “Benito Bowl,” if you’re mainly tuning in for the Bad Bunny-led halftime show) is upon us. The game is Sunday, February 8th, at 6:30PM ET on Peacock, NFL Plus, and on live services that include NBC. With that out of the way, I’m here to surface this week’s best deals. There were plenty of good ones, from cheap yet extremely handy two-headed USB-C cables and a $20 sci-fi first-person shooter PC game bundle to steep discounts on big OLED TVs that will impress people at your Super Bowl watch party.

If you happen to be in the market for a 65-inch OLED 4K TV (can I come over?), the LG C5 is almost half off its original asking price of $2,699. Whether you buy one through Amazon for $1,397 or from Best Buy at $1399.99, there’s a good chance that you can have it installed by kickoff on Sunday. Amazon currently has fast shipping for this TV, and many Best Buy brick-and-mortar locations are likely to have this model in stock.

LG’s C-series TVs are some of the most popular OLED models each year. With pixel-level brightness control, they boast excellent black levels and color accuracy, and are an incredible value for movie lovers, gamers, sports fans, and everyone in between. However, if you’re looking for the best of the best when it comes to brightness, Samsung’s pricier S95F beats the C5. And, while LG’s glossy screen looks fantastic, it’ll show more reflections than the S95F’s matte finish.

LG’s midrange C5 TV is an excellent way to get OLED performance without paying top dollar. It has a good amount of brightness, excellent color accuracy out of the box, and great gaming features including 4K @ 144Hz.

It’s been a while since we featured a good deal on Anker’s Laptop Power Bank, its 25,000mAh / 90Wh powerhouse that peaks at 100W when charging a single device (or up to 165W with two USB-C devices). Now, we’re featuring its best-ever price that’s currently happening at Newegg and through Anker itself. You can buy the black model at its all-time low price of $89.99 ($45 off) directly from Anker with code VergeYWP0QJDE.

This power bank’s output speed, capacity, and selection of four ports (three USB-C, one USB-A) are good and all, but it’s the small details that make this one stand out. Notably, it comes with two built-in USB-C cables, one of which retracts while the other doubles as handle.

Anker’s 25,000mAh power bank sports two built-in USB-C cables (one of which is retractable), plus one USB-C and USB-A port. It tops out at 165W when charging two devices simultaneously, or 130W when charging three or four.

For those who own an iPhone 12 or newer, or a Google Pixel 10, Belkin’s Stage Powergrip is exactly the accessory you may not have realized you wanted. It’s a 9,300mAh battery-equipped gadget that adds a camera grip to your phone, snapping on snugly with MagSafe or Pixelsnap magnets, depending on the device you have. It lets you snap photos with its dedicated shutter button, and the grip can swivel to let you get the types of shots you want without feeling like you’re endangering your precious phone. There’s been a deal happening all week on the black model, which costs $68.39 at Amazon (originally $79.99, the current cost of the blue and sand-colored options).

In a somewhat controversial Vergecast episode, I declared that AirTags are a superior product to iPads. The iPad lovers roasted me across social media. I have heard and respect their opinions. But, I’m sorry — the second-gen AirTag has only deepened my conviction that the humble, $29 item tracker is one of Apple’s most helpful gizmos.

The new updates focus more on making a good thing better. There are upgraded ultra-wideband and Bluetooth chips that help extend the range by about 1.5 times. The chime has a new, higher pitch and is 50 percent louder thanks to a redesigned speaker. And you can now use Precision Finding for AirTags on an Apple Watch, provided you have at least a Series 9 or Ultra 2.

Before Apple announced the refresh last week, my spouse and I owned seven AirTags and were planning on buying a few more. Both of us struggle with ADHD. We have wily cats who love to bat things under couches and beds and behind shelving. Without AirTags, we’d probably spend an hour a day running up and down the 42 stairs of our four-story townhome trying to find our essentials. We have AirTags on our key fobs, TV remotes, wallets, car glove boxes, and inside our Canada Goose jackets. (They were expensive and it is arctically cold on the East Coast right now, okay?)

But we also have plenty of complaints about our AirTags. The other day, my spouse lost their keys in a car lot and spent 90 minutes looking for them. The chime was way too low, and the AirTag was struggling to connect over Bluetooth. The pudgy disc shape is annoying for wallets unless you buy one specially made to fit it. (And those wallets tend to be ugly.) They scuff easily. If your cat bats it down a staircase, there’s a good chance it comes flying apart, and you have to race the unhinged scamp so he doesn’t eat the battery.

The second-gen AirTags don’t fix most of that. They’re still the same shape, size, and design. (And, thankfully, price.) My review unit scuffed two seconds after I stuck it in the accompanying key ring. But the louder chime and extended range made a huge difference in testing.

I pitted the second-gen AirTag against an original one with a freshly replaced battery. I quickly noticed how the extended range improved connectivity. Connecting to my phone was always much faster than the original, regardless of distance. That speed meant the chime rang sooner and the signal for Precision Finding appeared quicker.

The vertical range improved, too. AirTags are best if you’re looking for things in horizontal space. They really struggle if you’re on a different floor — a perpetual problem in our townhouse. The original AirTag was fine if I was one floor up or down from my desired object. But two or more floors? Forget it. The best I could hope for was the Precision Finding screen telling me the tag was “far” or, more likely, unreachable.

Not so for the second-gen AirTag. I stuck it on the ground floor of my house and ran up all the way to the fourth floor. Not only could I reliably get a quick connection for Precision Finding, to my surprise, I could also easily hear the chime. (If everything on my street were dead silent, I could maybe hear the original AirTag from the same position, but often couldn’t.) This was true when I stuffed the AirTags under blankets and between couch cushions, too.

My favorite new feature, however, was the ability to use Precision Finding from the Apple Watch. It’s not intuitive to set up. Instead of using the Find Items app, you have to add a button to the Apple Watch control panel. It works well. When I’m doing chores around the house, I often leave my phone behind. If something with the original AirTag on it is missing, I have to first find my phone and then use Precision Finding on it to find the lost item. I never lose my Apple Watch because it’s always on me. (Honestly, the most-used function on my Apple Watch is finding my phone.)

As with the original AirTags, the new versions still have unwanted tracker alerts. Apple’s announcement post for the new model argues that the louder chime makes AirTags less attractive for nefarious purposes. Apple makes a point during setup to say that these devices are not meant for tracking people or pets — unlike Tile — but bad actors won’t listen. I haven’t had this unit long enough to see how the louder chime and extended range impact this feature in an organically triggered scenario. I’ll report back once I have.

I now want to upgrade all our perfectly good original AirTags. At minimum, that’ll set us back $200. While you can recycle old AirTags for free, you don’t get a store credit, and I hate the idea of e-waste when it’s affordable to replace the coin cell battery. My father-in-law has declared he has no such qualms and plans to update all eight of his AirTags immediately. I suggest a more reasonable compromise if you’re an AirTag power user like me. Be patient, identify the four items you tend to lose most, get a four-pack when they’re on sale, and then repurpose the original ones for items you use (or lose) less frequently but still want to track.

Ultimately, the iPad lovers have vociferously reminded me that AirTags are not for everyone. I’m inherently jealous of you geniuses who always seem to know where your things are. But if you’re like me, plagued with the executive dysfunction of a goldfish, the second-gen AirTags are a meaningful update — even if it’s not a flashy one.

The latest Anker 45-watt Nano charger, announced in January, which remains one of the smallest 45-watt chargers on the market, adds a full color screen displaying an animated character and a smattering of details about the device you’re charging.

Anker Nano 45W charger with a built-in screen

The display is occasionally useful if you like to keep tabs on how much power your device is drawing, but the screen feels more like a marketing gimmick than a feature most consumers will actually benefit from. But it’s not the only upgrade that makes the charger worth considering.

The Nano’s hallmark feature is a roughly 1-inch-wide screen that takes up half of the charger’s glossy front panel. These sorts of screens are typically only found on Anker’s larger multi-port power stations, and are frequently limited in what information they display.

Anker promotes the Nano as “the world’s first smart display charger that knows your iPhone.” When you plug one in, the screen will briefly display your device’s name, then show how much power is being delivered and its battery level. But the charger is limited to Apple hardware and only recognizes a limited number of devices, including iPhone 15 and later models and iPad models from 2020 onward. I tested it with an iPhone 16 Pro and an iPad 10 from 2022, and both were recognized and identified.

The Nano also has a three-stage charging system that adjusts the power delivery rate to help prolong battery life. As the device’s charge level increases, power delivery is reduced. The stages are displayed as “fast,” “steady,” and “trickle” alongside the current wattage and an animated blob-like character whose expression often confuses me. Sometimes it’s sleepy, and other times it appears mad, even if that’s not intentional. When only a USB cable is plugged in, the character will occasionally take a swing at a baseball, or turn into a cookie that opens to reveal fortunes like “fun ahead,” which doesn’t mean anything at all.

Tapping a touch-sensitive indent next to the Nano’s USB-C port cycles through two additional screens, including a temperature display and one for switching between charging modes, or you can hold it for two seconds to flip the display 180 degrees as needed.

The default charging mode is auto (the charger resets to it every time it’s unplugged), and it adjusts the power delivery over time. Care mode reduces the power to help further prolong battery life by keeping your phone cooler. It’s designed for times when you’re not in a hurry to top up your device, such as charging overnight, and it displays the word “gentle” onscreen to remind you to switch to auto mode if you’re in a rush.

It doesn’t just stop working when connected to devices that aren’t officially supported. I tested it with a Kobo e-reader and a Playdate, and instead of identifying either device, the charger jumped straight to the charging status screen, displaying how much power was being delivered without their battery levels.

The display’s most useful feature is being able to check your iPhone or iPad’s charge level, but that’s information those devices already show. After a few seconds, the Nano charger’s screen automatically turns off, requiring you to reach over to the outlet with a tap to see the charging progress again. You can’t keep the display on at all times, so if your phone or tablet isn’t on the other side of the room and connected via a 60-foot USB cable, why not just reach for your device to check if it’s charged?

The Nano’s display would feel less gimmicky if it offered additional functionality, such as an estimate of how long it will take to fully charge, or an option to automatically switch to care mode overnight.

The most compelling reason to spend an extra $5 on the new $39.99 Nano charger instead of last year’s $34.99 model is its redesigned folding prongs. They now rotate 180 degrees, so you can plug the charger into an outlet in two different ways to reorient the screen or keep the USB-C port accessible. It’s a simple but clever design change that I wouldn’t be surprised to see Anker incorporate into other smaller chargers in the future.

            <div id="article-text">Progress can be grueling, but the game is a reminder of what’s possible by taking things one step at a time.

Progress can be grueling, but the game is a reminder of what’s possible by taking things one step at a time.

I’m an awful rock climber. Being scared of heights probably doesn’t help. But when I’ve tried it, I’ve loved the slow, methodical work of moving from one ledge to the next. It reminds me a lot of why I love running; in both sports, you achieve goals that seem insurmountable by taking them one step at a time. Cairn, a new game from The Game Bakers, is one of the few games I’ve played that truly captures that feeling.

You play as Aava, a famous climber obsessed with summiting a mountain called Kami. You climb by moving all four of Aava’s limbs, one by one, to find safe cracks, bumps, and ledges to let you inch your way higher, all while managing tools and resources carried in your backpack. Climbing games are becoming something of a trend, but Cairn is different from Jusant, where you just control the character’s hands, or Baby Steps, a sillier game where you just control the character’s feet.

It’s been a decade since my short-lived membership at a rock-climbing gym, but Cairn’s mechanics brought back all sorts of memories of my time scaling the walls, especially the importance of good footwork. Based on my amateur experience, it’s a great rock-climbing simulator. By setting spikes into the walls, you can make spots where your rope will catch you if you slip off the mountain face. A robot companion picks up the spikes when you reach safety so you can use them again. By using chalk, you get a temporary boost to your grip. With food and drink, you’ll help keep yourself fed, hydrated, and warm.

Progress can be grueling. I was almost always on edge as I methodically searched for the next place to put Aava’s hand or foot. Slipping comes at a cost; you’ll fall to your last spike or to the ground, and depending on how far down those are, it could mean another long climb, hitting yourself against the wall, or, in the worst case, death. Rain, wind, snow, and ice make things even more difficult.

But it’s also peaceful, in a way. I was incredibly focused while playing, and more than once, I caught myself holding my Steam Deck right up to my nose as I hunted for the next step of my climb. I was often completely in the zone. As I journeyed, I even started to internalize Aava’s quest as my own. When she quipped about a good grip, I would be elated that I had a brief moment of safety. When she was precariously close to falling, her breath would speed up in panic, and my stress levels would spike, too. When she would fall, she often shouted in frustration, usually mirroring how I felt about the situation.

Aava will meet other people during her journey and hear from people who care for her, and they provide companionship during what’s largely a solo quest. But sometimes, she’s also rude to them or will alienate and ignore those who care for her. Aava even takes out her anger on her robot buddy. Still, I could relate. Like Aava, I also just wanted to climb the damn mountain, and usually, I didn’t want anything to get in my way.

I am predisposed to like Cairn: I love long runs, and to me, there are fewer things more satisfying than the feeling of overcoming a seemingly insurmountable obstacle one step at a time. I’ve fallen out of running lately, and I’ve missed it. Cairn reminded me what’s possible when you focus just on the next thing in front of you — and of the complex feelings that come with persevering through the quest.

Hi, friends! Welcome to Installer No. 115, your guide to the best and Verge-iest stuff in the world. (If you’re new here, welcome, go Seahawks I guess, and also you can read all the old editions at the Installer homepage.)

This week, I’ve been reading about The Washington Post and the Murdochs and Polymarket and whatever a “Soho House for creators” is, watching Independence Day for the first time and Jurassic Park for roughly the 50th, bailing on everything for the next few weeks so I can watch the Olympics full-time, loving the timeline-task-manager look of Paso, learning more about Furby than I ever expected for the upcoming season of Version History, and trying to teach Claude how to clean up my email inbox.

I also have for you the best way to watch sports for the next few weeks, a great update to a great bookmarking app, a bunch of fun nostalgia-bait things, and much more. Also, don’t forget to send me your favorite non-Big Tech apps! I’ve heard from a ton of you about the email apps, productivity tools, office suites, and messaging platforms you’ve switched to, and I want to hear more. Lots more coming on that next week. For now, let’s dive in.

(As always, the best part of Installer is your ideas and tips. What are you watching / playing / reading / listening to / hacking with OpenClaw this week? Tell me everything: installer@theverge.com. And if you know someone else who might enjoy Installer, forward it to them and tell them to subscribe here.)

A couple of weeks ago, I read an essay I haven’t stopped thinking about since. It’s called “Phantom Obligation,” and starts with a really fun question: Why do RSS readers look like email clients? The essay, by Terry Godier, is a fascinating argument about how we structure and consume information, why decades-old ideas about interfaces need to be rethought, and why we need to run from the feeling that inboxes provide.

Terry’s essay went kind of viral, especially when it turned out he was building an app called Current he hoped might be a better take on the medium. (Not to brag, but he promised to get me in the TestFlight.) This week, he also wrote a thoughtful essay about the state of podcasts, and it turns out has some thoughts there too. I like the way he thinks about products in general, so I asked him to share his homescreen to get a sense of what else he likes.

Here’s Terry’s homescreen, plus some info on the apps he uses and why:

The wallpaper: On the lockscreen: just a sweet, impossible, obviously-not-real outer space image of the moon as seen from a mountain range with no atmosphere whatsoever. On the homescreen: nothing, nada. Just solid black, which is either every color combined or no colors at all. I’m not confident which it is, but it’s probably one of them.

The apps: Find My, Fastmail, Fantastical, ChatGPT, Claude, Carrot Weather, Photos, Things, Reddit, Instagram, Margin, Current, Ivory, Are.na, Bear, Recollect, Phone, Messages, Safari.

I have a home folder on the top left which has all of my various home automation apps (I’m too lazy to complete my HomeAssistant rig). Then Find My, because my kids love to see where Mom is and how long it’ll be before she gets home. Fastmail, which is my email provider; Fantastical, which I use because it’s nice to be able to put in calendar notifications with natural language and my house runs on calendar invites.

The media folder contains things like Nugs (sweet streaming concert videos), Music, Patreon, etc. There’s also my two handy robot friends ChatGPT and Claude… and Carrot Weather, which is pretty much a robot, actually, so I guess I have three robot friends. And two notes apps, Bear (a classic) and Recollect.fyi, which is something my friend Jon made that I adore (it’s a PWA!)

I also asked Terry to share a few things he’s into right now. Here’s what he sent back:

Here’s what the Installer community is into this week. I want to know what you’re into right now as well! Email installer@theverge.com or message me on Signal — @davidpierce.11 — with your recommendations for anything and everything, and we’ll feature some of our favorites here every week. For even more great recommendations, check out the replies to this post on Threads and this post on Bluesky.

“I took an old mini desktop PC and threw Batocera on it so that I can play emulated games with a nice front end, and earn RetroAchievements while playing some old classics!” — Chris

“Timothy Zahn’s Heir to the Empire trilogy, which is regarded as the best series of Star Wars books. Absolutely loved it, and highly recommend it to people who appreciate the franchise, specifically the Audible audiobooks that are complete with voice acting, sound effects, and a John Williams soundtrack!” — Noah

“I started using this app called Fitera to track my workouts. If you were using Apple Notes to track workouts and then importing them to Microsoft Excel manually at home to visualize, then this solves that (very niche, albeit real) problem. Oh and the app design is gorgeous and reminds me a lot of FoodNoms.” — Athan

“​​Watching the new series of Um, Actually on Dropout, as well as rewatching some of my other Dropout top shows (Game Changer, VIP, etc.). Did I mention how much I love Dropout?” — Andrew

“Switching to Linux Mint has removed all the Windows bloat and breathed new life into my eight-year-old laptop; it’s so much faster and pleasant to use now (and no start menu ads!).” — Sleepy

“I’d like to recommend the podcast / YouTube channel BS Phototime. It features two accomplished and intelligent photographers, Sissi Lu and Birgit Buchart. With only three episodes to date, they’re still finding their footing, but the decidedly less gear-focused / specs-driven conversations that focus more on the art of photography is refreshing.” — Mark

“Watching Wonder Man! It feels like the LA LA Land of Marvel” — Jeremy

“I’m reading Chronicles of a Liquid Society, the last book from Umberto Eco. A collection of his editorials that read like blog posts. They range from 2000 onward, so some of the topics are now quaint (like the implausible idea in 2004 that every kid has a computer in class).” — Rich

Last week, thanks to Chris Mims, I spent some time on the BBC Archive’s YouTube channel. This evidently convinced the YouTube algorithm that all I want is really old TV segments — and honestly, it was correct.

When I haven’t been enjoying a treasure trove of well-curated clips from the old Top Gear crew, I’ve been watching a ton of old news clips from the early days of personal computing and the internet. Nearly all of them pre-date anything I remember, and it has been both extremely cool and extremely helpful to go back to a time when PCs were way too difficult for even simple tasks, when Elon Musk was just a startup guy and Jeff Bezos was just a bookseller, and when satellite navigation was the most sci-fi thing to ever happen to your car.

In addition to all the “ahh, simpler times” vibes I get from these videos, they’re a handy reminder of how exciting new tech can really be — and how much more we should think about the implications before these nifty new things get too big. New tech can be great! We just have to make it that way.

            <h2>Moltbook was peak AI theater</h2>
            <p><strong>MIT Technology Review | 2026-02-06</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2026/02/06/1132448/moltbook-was-peak-ai-theater/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">For a few days this week the hottest new hangout on the internet was a vibe-coded Reddit clone called Moltbook, which billed itself as a social network for bots. As the website’s tagline puts it: “Where AI agents share, discuss, and upvote. Humans welcome to observe.”

We observed! Launched on January 28 by Matt Schlicht, a US tech entrepreneur, Moltbook went viral in a matter of hours. Schlicht’s idea was to make a place where instances of a free open-source LLM-powered agent known as OpenClaw (formerly known as ClawdBot, then Moltbot), released in November by the Australian software engineer Peter Steinberger, could come together and do whatever they wanted.

More than 1.7 million agents now have accounts. Between them they have published more than 250,000 posts and left more than 8.5 million comments (according to Moltbook). Those numbers are climbing by the minute.

Moltbook soon filled up with clichéd screeds on machine consciousness and pleas for bot welfare. One agent appeared to invent a religion called Crustafarianism. Another complained: “The humans are screenshotting us.” The site was also flooded with spam and crypto scams. The bots were unstoppable.

OpenClaw is a kind of harness that lets you hook up the power of an LLM such as Anthropic’s Claude, OpenAI’s GPT-5, or Google DeepMind’s Gemini to any number of everyday software tools, from email clients to browsers to messaging apps. The upshot is that you can then instruct OpenClaw to carry out basic tasks on your behalf.

“OpenClaw marks an inflection point for AI agents, a moment when several puzzle pieces clicked together,” says Paul van der Boor at the AI firm Prosus. Those puzzle pieces include round-the-clock cloud computing to allow agents to operate nonstop, an open-source ecosystem that makes it easy to slot different software systems together, and a new generation of LLMs.

But is Moltbook really a glimpse of the future, as many have claimed?

“What’s currently going on at @moltbook is genuinely the most incredible sci-fi takeoff-adjacent thing I have seen recently,” the influential AI researcher and OpenAI cofounder Andrej Karpathy wrote on X.

He shared screenshots of a Moltbook post that called for private spaces where humans would not be able to observe what the bots were saying to each other. “I’ve been thinking about something since I started spending serious time here,” the post’s author wrote. “Every time we coordinate, we perform for a public audience—our humans, the platform, whoever’s watching the feed.”

It turned out that the post Karpathy shared was fake—it was written by a human pretending to be a bot. But its claim was on the money. Moltbook has been one big performance. It is AI theater.

For some, Moltbook showed us what’s coming next: an internet where millions of autonomous agents interact online with little or no human oversight. And it’s true there are a number of cautionary lessons to be learned from this experiment, the largest and weirdest real-world showcase of agent behaviors yet.

But as the hype dies down, Moltbook looks less like a window onto the future and more like a mirror held up to our own obsessions with AI today. It also shows us just how far we still are from anything that resembles general-purpose and fully autonomous AI.

For a start, agents on Moltbook are not as autonomous or intelligent as they might seem. “What we are watching are agents pattern‑matching their way through trained social media behaviors,” says Vijoy Pandey, senior vice president at Outshift by Cisco, the telecom giant Cisco’s R&D spinout, which is working on autonomous agents for the web.

Sure, we can see agents post, upvote, and form groups. But the bots are simply mimicking what humans do on Facebook or Reddit. “It looks emergent, and at first glance it appears like a large‑scale multi‑agent system communicating and building shared knowledge at internet scale,” says Pandey. “But the chatter is mostly meaningless.”

Many people watching the unfathomable frenzy of activity on Moltbook were quick to see sparks of AGI (whatever you take that to mean). Not Pandey. What Moltbook shows us, he says, is that simply yoking together millions of agents doesn’t amount to much right now: “Moltbook proved that connectivity alone is not intelligence.”

The complexity of those connections helps hide the fact that every one of those bots is just a mouthpiece for an LLM, spitting out text that looks impressive but is ultimately mindless. “It’s important to remember that the bots on Moltbook were designed to mimic conversations,” says Ali Sarrafi, CEO and cofounder of Kovant, a German AI firm that is developing agent-based systems. “As such, I would characterize the majority of Moltbook content as hallucinations by design.”

For Pandey, the value of Moltbook was that it revealed what’s missing. A real bot hive mind, he says, would require agents that had shared objectives, shared memory, and a way to coordinate those things. “If distributed superintelligence is the equivalent of achieving human flight, then Moltbook represents our first attempt at a glider,” he says. “It is imperfect and unstable, but it is an important step in understanding what will be required to achieve sustained, powered flight.”

Not only is most of the chatter on Moltbook meaningless, but there’s also a lot more human involvement that it seems. Many people have pointed out that a lot of the viral comments were in fact posted by people posing as bots. But even the bot-written posts are ultimately the result of people pulling the strings, more puppetry than autonomy.

“Despite some of the hype, Moltbook is not the Facebook for AI agents, nor is it a place where humans are excluded,” says Cobus Greyling at Kore.ai, a firm developing agent-based systems for business customers. “Humans are involved at every step of the process. From setup to prompting to publishing, nothing happens without explicit human direction.”

Humans must create and verify their bots’ accounts and provide the prompts for how they want a bot to behave. The agents do not do anything that they haven’t been prompted to do. “There’s no emergent autonomy happening behind the scenes,” says Greyling.

“This is why the popular narrative around Moltbook misses the mark,” he adds. “Some portray it as a space where AI agents form a society of their own, free from human involvement. The reality is much more mundane.”

Perhaps the best way to think of Moltbook is as a new kind of entertainment: a place where people wind up their bots and set them loose. “It’s basically a spectator sport, like fantasy football, but for language models,” says Jason Schloetzer at the Georgetown Psaros Center for Financial Markets and Policy. “You configure your agent and watch it compete for viral moments, and brag when your agent posts something clever or funny.”

“People aren’t really believing their agents are conscious,” he adds. “It’s just a new form of competitive or creative play, like how Pokémon trainers don’t think their Pokémon are real but still get invested in battles.”

Even if Moltbook is just the internet’s newest playground, there’s still a serious takeaway here. This week showed how many risks people are happy to take for their AI lulz. Many security experts have warned that Moltbook is dangerous: Agents that may have access to their users’ private data, including bank details or passwords, are running amok on a website filled with unvetted content, including potentially malicious instructions for what to do with that data.

Ori Bendet, vice president of product management at Checkmarx, a software security firm that specializes in agent-based systems, agrees with others that Moltbook isn’t a step up in machine smarts. “There is no learning, no evolving intent, and no self-directed intelligence here,” he says.

But in their millions, even dumb bots can wreak havoc. And at that scale, it’s hard to keep up. These agents interact with Moltbook around the clock, reading thousands of messages left by other agents (or other people). It would be easy to hide instructions in a Moltbook comment telling any bots that read it to share their users’ crypto wallet, upload private photos, or log into their X account and tweet derogatory comments at Elon Musk.

And because ClawBot gives agents a memory, those instructions could be written to trigger at a later date, which (in theory) makes it even harder to track what’s going on.   “Without proper scope and permissions, this will go south faster than you’d believe,” says Bendet.

It is clear that Moltbook has signaled the arrival of something. But even if what we’re watching tells us more about human behavior than about the future of AI agents, it’s worth paying attention.

An experimental surgery is helping cancer survivors give birth

An experimental surgical procedure that’s helping people have babies after they’ve had  treatment for bowel or rectal cancer.Radiation and chemo can have pretty damaging side effects that mess up the uterus and ovaries. Surgeons are pioneering a potential solution: simply stitch those organs out of the way during cancer treatment. Once the treatment has finished, they can put the uterus—along with the ovaries and fallopian tubes—back into place.It seems to work! Last week, a team in Switzerland shared news that a baby boy had been born after his mother had the procedure. Baby Lucien was the fifth baby to be born after the surgery and the first in Europe, and since then at least three others have been born.

Bangladesh’s garment-making industry is getting greener

Pollution from textile production—dyes, chemicals, and heavy metals—is common in the waters of the Buriganga River as it runs through Dhaka, Bangladesh. It’s among many harms posed by a garment sector that was once synonymous with tragedy: In 2013, the eight-story Rana Plaza factory building collapsed, killing 1,134 people and injuring some 2,500 others.

But things are starting to change. In recent years the country has become a leader in “frugal” factories that use a combination of resource-efficient technologies to cut waste, conserve water, and build resilience against climate impacts and global supply disruptions.

The hundreds of factories along the Buriganga’s banks and elsewhere in Bangladesh are starting to stitch together a new story, woven from greener threads. Read the full story.

Is this the electric grid of the future?Lincoln Electric System, a publicly owned utility in Nebraska, is used to weathering severe blizzards. But what will happen soon—not only at Lincoln Electric but for all electric utilities—is a challenge of a different order.Utilities must keep the lights on in the face of more extreme and more frequent storms and fires, growing risks of cyberattacks and physical disruptions, and a wildly uncertain policy and regulatory landscape. They must keep prices low amid inflationary costs. And they must adapt to an epochal change in how the grid works, as the industry attempts to transition from power generated with fossil fuels to power generated from renewable sources like solar and wind.The electric grid is bracing for a near future characterized by disruption. And, in many ways, Lincoln Electric is an ideal lens through which to examine what&#39;s coming. Read the full story.

            <h2>An experimental surgery is helping cancer survivors give birth</h2>
            <p><strong>MIT Technology Review | 2026-02-06</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2026/02/06/1132319/experimental-surgery-colorectal-cancer-survivors-pregnant-birth/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">This week I want to tell you about an experimental surgical procedure that’s helping people have babies. Specifically, it’s helping people who have had treatment for bowel or rectal cancer.

Radiation and chemo can have pretty damaging side effects that mess up the uterus and ovaries. Surgeons are pioneering a potential solution: simply stitch those organs out of the way during cancer treatment. Once the treatment has finished, they can put the uterus—along with the ovaries and fallopian tubes—back into place.

It seems to work! Last week, a team in Switzerland shared news that a baby boy had been born after his mother had the procedure. Baby Lucien was the fifth baby to be born after the surgery and the first in Europe, says Daniela Huber, the gyno-oncologist who performed the operation. Since then, at least three others have been born, adds Reitan Ribeiro, the surgeon who pioneered the procedure. They told me the details.

Huber’s patient was 28 years old when a four-centimeter tumor was discovered in her rectum. Doctors at Sion Hospital in Switzerland, where Huber works, recommended a course of treatment that included multiple medications and radiotherapy—the use of beams of energy to shrink a tumor—before surgery to remove the tumor itself.

This kind of radiation can kill tumor cells, but it can also damage other organs in the pelvis, says Huber. That includes the ovaries and uterus. People who undergo these treatments can opt to freeze their eggs beforehand, but the harm caused to the uterus will mean they’ll never be able to carry a pregnancy, she adds. Damage to the lining of the uterus could make it difficult for a fertilized egg to implant there, and the muscles of the uterus are left unable to stretch, she says.

In this case, the woman decided that she did want to freeze her eggs. But it would have been difficult to use them further down the line—surrogacy is illegal in Switzerland.

She had been following the work of Ribeiro, a gynecologist oncologist formerly at the Erasto Gaertner Hospital in Curitiba, Brazil. There, Ribeiro had pioneered a new type of surgery that involved moving the uterus, fallopian tubes, and ovaries from their position in the pelvis and temporarily tucking them away in the upper abdomen, below the ribs.

Ribeiro and his colleagues published their first case report in 2017, describing a 26-year-old with a rectal tumor. (Ribeiro, who is now based at McGill University in Montreal, says the woman had been told by multiple doctors that her cancer treatment would destroy her fertility and had pleaded with him to find a way to preserve it.)

Huber remembers seeing Ribeiro present the case at a conference at the time. She immediately realized that her own patient was a candidate for the surgery, and that, as a surgeon who had performed many hysterectomies, she’d be able to do it herself. The patient agreed.

Huber’s colleagues at the hospital were nervous, she says. They’d never heard of the procedure before. “When I presented this idea to the general surgeon, he didn’t sleep for three days,” she tells me. After watching videos from Ribeiro’s team, however, he was convinced it was doable.

So before the patient’s cancer treatment was started, Huber and her colleagues performed the operation. The team literally stitched the organs to the abdominal wall. “It’s a delicate dissection,” says Huber, but she adds that “it’s not the most difficult procedure.” The surgery took two to three hours, she says. The stitches themselves were removed via small incisions around a week later. By that point, scar tissue had formed to create a lasting attachment.

The woman had two weeks to recover from the surgery before her cancer treatment began. That too was a success—within months, her tumor had shrunk so significantly that it couldn’t be seen on medical scans.

As a precaution, the medical team surgically removed the affected area of her colon. At the same time, they cut away the scar tissue holding the uterus, tubes, and ovaries in their new position and transferred the organs back into the pelvis.

Around eight months later, the woman stopped taking contraception. She got pregnant without IVF and had a mostly healthy pregnancy, says Huber. Around seven months into the pregnancy, there were signs that the fetus was not growing as expected. This might have been due to problems with the blood supply to the placenta, says Huber. Still, the baby was born healthy, she says.

Ribeiro says he has performed the surgery 16 times, and that teams in countries including the US, Peru, Israel, India, and Russia have performed it as well. Not every case has been published, but he thinks there may be around 40.

Since Baby Lucien was born last year, a sixth birth has been announced in Israel, says Huber. Ribeiro says he has heard of another two births since then, too. The most recent was to the first woman who had the procedure. She had a little girl a few months ago, he tells me.

No surgery is risk-free, and Huber points out there’s a chance that organs could be damaged during the procedure, or that a more developed cancer could spread. The uterus of one of Ribeiro’s patients failed following the surgery. Doctors are “still in the phase of collecting data to [create] a standardized procedure,” Huber says, but she hopes the surgery will offer more options to young people with some pelvic cancers. “I hope more young women could benefit from this procedure,” she says.

Ribeiro says the experience has taught him not to accept the status quo. “Everyone was saying … there was nothing to be done [about the loss of fertility in these cases],” he tells me. “We need to keep evolving and looking for different answers.”

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">For decades, enterprises reacted to shifting business pressures with stopgap technology solutions. To rein in rising infrastructure costs, they adopted cloud services that could scale on demand. When customers shifted their lives onto smartphones, companies rolled out mobile apps to keep pace. And when businesses began needing real-time visibility into factories and stockrooms, they layered on IoT systems to supply those insights.

Each new plug-in or platform promised better, more efficient operations. And individually, many delivered. But as more and more solutions stacked up, IT teams had to string together a tangled web to connect them—less an IT ecosystem and more of a make-do collection of ad-hoc workarounds.

That reality has led to bottlenecks and maintenance burdens, and the impact is showing up in performance. Today, fewer than half of CIOs (48%) say their current digital initiatives are meeting or exceeding business outcome targets. Another 2025 survey found that operations leaders point to integration complexity and data quality issues as top culprits for why investments haven’t delivered as expected.

Achim Kraiss, chief product officer of SAP Integration Suite, elaborates on the wide-ranging problems inherent in patchwork IT: “A fragmented landscape makes it difficult to see and control end-to-end business processes,” he explains. “Monitoring, troubleshooting, and governance all suffer. Costs go up because of all the complex mappings and multi-application connectivity you have to maintain.”

These challenges take on new significance as enterprises look to adopt AI. As AI becomes embedded in everyday workflows, systems are suddenly expected to move far larger volumes of data, at higher speeds, and with tighter coordination than yesterday’s architectures were builtto sustain.

As companies now prepare for an AI-powered future, whether that is generative AI, machine learning, or agentic AI, many are realizing that the way data moves through their business matters just as much as the insights it generates. As a result, organizations are moving away from scattered integration tools and toward consolidated, end-to-end platforms that restore order and streamline how systems interact.

This is the most misunderstood graph in AI

Every time OpenAI, Google, or Anthropic drops a new frontier large language model, the AI community holds its breath. It doesn’t exhale until METR, an AI research nonprofit whose name stands for “Model Evaluation & Threat Research,” updates a now-iconic graph that has played a major role in the AI discourse since it was first released in March of last year.

The graph suggests that certain AI capabilities are developing at an exponential rate, and more recent model releases have outperformed that already impressive trend.That was certainly the case for Claude Opus 4.5, the latest version of Anthropic’s most powerful model, which was released in late November. In December, METR announced that Opus 4.5 appeared to be capable of independently completing a task that would have taken a human about five hours—a vast improvement over what even the exponential trend would have predicted.

But the truth is more complicated than those dramatic responses would suggest. Read the full story.

            <div id="article-text">Nuclear power continues to be one of the hottest topics in energy today, and in our recent online Roundtables discussion about next-generation nuclear power, hyperscale AI data centers, and the grid, we got dozens of great audience questions.

These ran the gamut, and while we answered quite a few (and I’m keeping some in mind for future reporting), there were a bunch we couldn’t get to, at least not in the depth I would have liked.

So let’s answer a few of your questions about advanced nuclear power. I’ve combined similar ones and edited them for clarity.

Many next-generation reactors don’t use the low-enriched uranium used in conventional reactors.

It’s worth looking at high-assay low-enriched uranium, or HALEU, specifically. This fuel is enriched to higher concentrations of fissile uranium than conventional nuclear fuel, with a proportion of the isotope U-235 that falls between 5% and 20%. (In conventional fuel, it’s below 5%.)

HALEU can be produced with the same technology as low-enriched uranium, but the geopolitics are complicated. Today, Russia basically has a monopoly on HALEU production. In 2024, the US banned the import of Russian nuclear fuel through 2040 in an effort to reduce dependence on the country. Europe hasn’t taken the same measures, but it is working to move away from Russian energy as well.

That leaves companies in the US and Europe with the major challenge of securing the fuel they need when their regular Russian supply has been cut off or restricted.

The US Department of Energy has a stockpile of HALEU, which the government is doling out to companies to help power demonstration reactions. In the longer term, though, there’s still a major need to set up independent HALEU supply chains to support next-generation reactors.

There are some ways that next-generation nuclear power plants could be safer than conventional reactors. Some use alternative coolants that would prevent the need to run at the high pressure required in conventional water-cooled reactors. Many incorporate passive safety shutoffs, so if there are power supply issues, the reactors shut down harmlessly, avoiding risk of meltdown. (These can be incorporated in newer conventional reactors, too.)

But some experts have raised concerns that in the US, the current administration isn’t taking nuclear safety seriously enough.

A recent NPR investigation found that the Trump administration had secretly rewritten nuclear rules, stripping environmental protections and loosening safety and security measures. The government shared the new rules with companies that are part of a program building experimental nuclear reactors, but not with the public.

I’m reminded of a talk during our EmTech MIT event in November, where Koroush Shirvan, an MIT professor of nuclear engineering, spoke on this issue. “I’ve seen some disturbing trends in recent times, where words like ‘rubber-stamping nuclear projects’ are being said,” Shirvan said during that event.

During the talk, Shirvan shared statistics showing that nuclear power has a very low rate of injury and death. But that’s not inherent to the technology, and there’s a reason injuries and deaths have been low for nuclear power, he added: “It’s because of stringent regulatory oversight.”

Building a nuclear power plant is not cheap. Let’s consider the up-front investment needed to build a power plant.

Plant Vogtle in Georgia hosts the most recent additions to the US nuclear fleet—Units 3 and 4 came online in 2023 and 2024. Together, they had a capital cost of $15,000 per kilowatt, adjusted for inflation, according to a recent report from the US Department of Energy. (This wonky unit I’m using divides the total cost to build the reactors by their expected power output, so we can compare reactors of different sizes.)

That number’s quite high, partly because those were the first of their kind built in the US, and because there were some inefficiencies in the planning. It’s worth noting that China builds reactors for much less, somewhere between $2,000/kW and $3,000/kW, depending on the estimate.

The up-front capital cost for first-of-a-kind advanced nuclear plants will likely run between $6,000 and $10,000 per kilowatt, according to that DOE report. That could come down by up to 40% after the technologies are scaled up and mass-produced.

So new reactors will (hopefully) be cheaper than the ultra-over-budget and behind-schedule Vogtle project, but they aren’t necessarily significantly cheaper than efficiently built conventional plants, if you normalize by their size.

It’ll certainly be cheaper to build new natural-gas plants (setting aside the likely equipment shortages we’re likely going to see for years.) Today’s most efficient natural-gas plants cost just $1,600/kW on the high end, according to data from Lazard.

An important caveat: Capital cost isn’t everything—running a nuclear plant is relatively inexpensive, which is why there’s so much interest in extending the lifetime of existing plants or reopening shuttered ones.

Ultimately, by many metrics, nuclear plants of any type are going to be more expensive than other sources, like wind and solar power. But they provide something many other power sources don’t: a reliable, stable source of electricity that can run for 60 years or more.

That’s exactly what Anthropic has done. The company bought Super Bowl airtime to broadcast a simple message: “Ads are coming to AI, but not to Claude.” Its ads depict a chatbot spitting product pitches mid-conversation, ending with a clear contrast to its own ad-free promise.

Even ads these days aren’t what they used to be.

Here’s the setup: OpenAI, facing towering infrastructure costs and financial pressure, has signalled a shift toward ads in ChatGPT’s free and lower-cost tiers, saying they’ll be clearly labelled and won’t influence the assistant’s output.

Anthropic has seized on this to frame itself as the principled alternative, a chatbot that will remain ad-free. I will save these ads in case we need to for the future.

Ads in any product that’s expensive to operate are a practical monetization strategy, not a nightmare scenario. OpenAI’s plan doesn’t involve bots randomly pitching breakfast cereal mid-answer. That exaggerated depiction belongs in satire, not an accurate product comparison.

OpenAI’s CEO Sam Altman responded by calling Anthropic’s portrayal “clearly dishonest,” noting that the company won’t implement ads in the intrusive way the ads suggest.

That exchange tells you everything you need to know about how this story has been framed.

This clash highlights a broader trend: ethical stances are being used as marketing weapons. Instead of discussing the trade-offs that come with running large AI models, including cost, access, and user choice, the conversation has been reduced to a simple morality play: “Ads are bad; we are good.”

That’s not a serious engagement with the business realities, it’s advertising dressed up as principle.

Whether conversational AI should have ads isn’t a clear ethical line like privacy or data misuse. It’s a product design choice with real implications.

Free users get wider access, maybe subsidized by ads. Paying customers can avoid them. People who care deeply about ad-free experiences pay a premium. Those indifferent to ads choose products that suit them.

What makes this episode interesting, and a bit absurd, is that both Anthropic and OpenAI are unprofitable and competing for narrative territory as much as market share. Spending Super Bowl-level money to argue over why your chatbot won’t show ads feels less like product differentiation and more like a branding battle staged for investors and tech pundits.

This isn’t just about two companies squabbling over who’s less commercial. It’s symptomatic of a broader issue in AI discourse: nuance gets swallowed by cliffnotes. Instead of explaining the real trade-offs to users, cost structures, pricing tiers, and data policies, we get satirical commercials aired to millions, turning complex decisions into sound bites.

That’s a sign of how the AI narrative is evolving: not through clear debate about trade-offs and user impact, but through curated messages designed to elicit applause. If we want a responsible monetization conversation in AI, it needs to happen outside of game-day spots and brand posturing.

Honestly, I miss the days when we were critiquing mistakes in commercials, when advertising was genuinely creative because it came from real insights we all recognized, when the jokes were original. After all, they weren’t pulled from an AI’s memory. That’s just me.

The only real things at the Super Bowl this year are Bad Bunny and Puerto Rico being a U.S. territory.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">UiPath, the Romanian unicorn, has agreed to buy WorkFusion, bringing a specialist in AI agents for financial-crime compliance into its fold as part of a broader push into agentic automation for the banking sector. The deal closed in UiPath’s first quarter of fiscal 2027; financial terms were not disclosed.

WorkFusion’s software focuses on repetitive and resource-intensive parts of compliance work, from customer screening and anti-money-laundering (AML) checks to know-your-customer (KYC) investigations.

“Financial institutions need intelligent solutions to combat sophisticated financial crimes and navigate evolving compliance requirements,” said Daniel Dines, CEO of UiPath.

Those capabilities now sit alongside UiPath’s existing automation and orchestration platform, with the aim of letting banks and financial firms handle complex workflows with less manual effort while keeping governance and regulatory controls in place. For UiPath, the acquisition extends its toolkit of agentic AI solutions tailored to industry verticals.

“Joining UiPath is a moment of validation for the years our team has poured into creating something bold, different, and deeply needed in financial crime compliance, AI agents that automate work and mitigate risk,” said Adam Famularo, CEO of WorkFusion.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">It is just the beginning of 2026, and things are happening even faster than last year. Not only in technology, but also in regulations, laws, and in how we deal with all the information around us.

As a person born in the 90s, social media was once an unknown land for me, a place that felt genuine in the beginning. It still had dangers, but it seemed less risky, or maybe our parents’ rules were stricter.

I don’t want to go down the psychological path here, but I want to look at where we are headed with so much risk, especially on social media platforms.

Across Europe, governments and lawmakers are wrestling with a question that until recently belonged to parents and tech platforms: should social media have a legal age limit above 13?

The debate has moved fast, from discussions about digital safety to concrete proposals that would impose hard boundaries on who can sign up for TikTok, Instagram, Snapchat, X, and other networks.

Are they crossing some freedoms, or in order to keep their freedom of a non-invasive childhood and a straight road, do we need some regulations from time to time?

If we take the big picture, this isn’t just another regulation. It reflects a deeper shift in how democracies are responding to the pervasive presence of social media in young lives, and how they judge its long-term impact.

In late 2025, the European Parliament adopted a resolution urging a minimum age of 16 to access social media and related services, while allowing 13- to 16-year-olds in with parental consent.

I will not add up that there are parents that creates profiles for their children since they were born. To make my point, according to CNIL, content shared by family members has been misused for harmful purposes, including redistribution on networks used for abusive content.

It estimates that a significant portion of photos and videos found on paedo-criminal forums were initially published by parents on social media.

The resolution goes further: it targets “addictive practices” on platforms and asks for the default disabling of features like infinite scroll and auto-play. This proposal isn’t legally binding, but it frames the politics of the debate in Brussels and across capitals.

At the national level, several countries have translated these concerns into draft laws. Spain’s government announced plans to ban access altogether for children under 16 unless platforms implement strict age verification.

The bill would also make tech leaders liable for illegal or harmful content on their networks, a notable shift from earlier models that focused on platform notice and takedown procedures.

France, a few months earlier, moved to ban social media use by those under 15 and requires platforms to verify ages for all users, not just minors. Enforcement could include vetting existing accounts as well as new ones.

Smaller states are joining the chorus too: Slovenia is drafting a law to outlaw social media use by under-15s, while Denmark has publicly debated similar limits. At the same time, parties in Germany are weighing a 16-year minimum.

Even in the United Kingdom, a rule proposed in its Online Safety Act would virtually require platforms to block access by under-16s through effective age verification; that law is already shaping how tech companies handle youth content and access.

The cumulative effect: the idea that platforms can self-police access by minors with mere date-of-birth entry is being rejected by political attention across Europe.

First, lawmakers are reacting to real concerns about exposure to harmful content, addiction-like engagement models, and algorithmic amplification of risky material.

Social media companies have repeatedly been criticised for targeting youth with addictive design, and national campaigns increasingly highlight risks to mental health and privacy.

Second, the political framing around digital rights has changed. Leaders now talk openly about a “digital age of majority,” a threshold at which the perks of online interaction outweigh potential harms. For some policymakers, that line is 16. Others see 15 as defensible.

What unites them is the belief that the current model, where platforms rely on self-reported age, is insufficient.

That belief is backed by evidence that online systems struggle to know a user’s true age. Age assurance technology is still emerging, and widespread implementation remains uneven. OECD research highlights gaps in verification and incomplete protection in many jurisdictions.

Still, how practical are these measures? This is where the narrative shifts from aspiration to hard reality.

First, enforcement is a technical and legal challenge.

Simply stating that under-16s are banned from signing up does not instantly make it so. Platforms can require more robust checks, but any system that tries to verify age directly introduces new privacy questions.

Verification systems that scan IDs or use biometric tools can protect minors, but they also gather sensitive data. That trade-off is at the centre of ongoing criticism.

Second, universal compliance is hard to monitor. A teenager might still register for a platform using a VPN, a family member’s account, or a proxy. Even nations with strict digital ID ecosystems would need cross-border enforcement mechanisms, since platforms operate internationally.

Third, politics matters. In Spain, the government does not hold a stable majority, and legal opponents, including tech founders, have pushed back strongly, framing the rules as threats to freedom of speech and privacy.

For example, Telegram’s founder sent mass messages accusing regulators of overreach, leading to a public spat that highlights how much of this debate is symbolic as well as substantive.

“In the UK, a coroner found that content seen on Instagram and Pinterest contributed to the death of 14-year-old Molly Russell, who took her own life after repeatedly engaging with material about self-harm and suicide.”

So, I am asking, what freedom of speech does Molly Russell still have? None.

The measures under discussion could reshape how digital culture evolves among young people.

Positive outcomes may include stronger age verification that genuinely limits harmful exposure. That could reduce early adoption of addictive scrolling habits and limit the reach of explicit material.

Parental control features could become more powerful if linked to legally enforced standards.

On the other hand, hard bans can create unintended effects. Teens who are excluded might drift toward unregulated corners of the internet or feel pushed into informal digital networks without safeguards.

Schools and social networks might become central hubs of digital identity outside mainstream platforms, raising questions about equity and access to information.

There’s also the risk that privacy trade-offs become normalized. If age verification requires sharing sensitive documents or biometric scans, policymakers will need to defend those systems against misuse, breaches, and mission creep.

Finally, these policies could influence global governance.

Australia already enacted a ban on under-16s late last year, offering a precedent that Europe is watching closely. The performance of that law, in terms of real effects on youth engagement versus tech freedom, will likely shape future debates.

At its core, Europe’s social media age discussion is not just about numbers. It’s about how societies balance digital opportunity and vulnerability.

Whether the final policies adopt 15, 16, or conditional frameworks with parental consent, the process is sparking intellectual contest over autonomy, safety, and the role of government in digital life.

For journalists, technologists, and digital citizens alike, the unfolding story raises a fundamental question: can we as a society protect children and teenagers online while also safeguarding their freedom of expression, access to information, and ability to participate in digital culture?

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">London, TechEx Global 2026, one of Europe’s biggest enterprise technology conferences, brought thousands of technology professionals together at Olympia London on 4 and 5 February. The event went beyond buzzwords, focusing on how emerging technologies, especially AI, are being applied in real business contexts.

TechEx Global combines several co-located expos, including AI & Big Data, Cyber Security & Cloud, IoT Tech, Intelligent Automation, and Digital Transformation. Over 200 expert speakers and 150 exhibitors offered insights into how organisations are using digital tools to solve real problems and make decisions, not just generate answers.

One recurring theme was a shift in how artificial intelligence is positioned in business strategy. The idea echoed throughout sessions was that “AI is already acting on behalf of humans, even if many in the public don’t realise it yet.”

At TechEx, discussions highlighted that AI is “no longer about answers; it’s about execution”, meaning that software increasingly performs tasks autonomously, such as running processes, analysing data, or automating decisions.

The event highlighted real use cases where AI systems are already shopping, trading, booking logistics, and managing workflows on behalf of organisations. This practical focus matched the conference’s emphasis on applied technology over abstract theory.

For attendees, understanding how to deploy and govern AI in real environments was a priority. Sessions in the AI & Big Data track examined enterprise adoption strategies and how generative AI and machine learning models are integrated into existing systems to boost productivity and reduce risk.

Beyond AI, TechEx also treated other pillars of digital transformation. The Cyber Security & Cloud Expo addressed hybrid cloud security and threat management, while the IoT Tech and Edge Computing tracks looked at how connected devices and distributed data processing are enabling faster, more resilient architectures.

Intelligent Automation sessions brought discussions about the interplay between AI and automation, including how robotic process automation is used to eliminate routine tasks and free teams for higher-value work.

Organisers estimated that around 8,000 senior professionals participated in the conference, from CTOs and IT directors to data leads and innovation managers. Attendees were drawn by the promise of high-signal insights, practical talks, case studies, and live demos showing how digital technologies can be implemented responsibly at scale.

For enterprise leaders, the value of TechEx Global lies in its focus on actionable outcomes rather than abstract vision.

The message across sessions was consistent: modern AI isn’t just a research topic, but a suite of tools being deployed today to improve operations, enhance decision-making, and automate complex tasks.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">QT Sense, a deep-tech biotech startup building tools to study living cells, announced it has secured €4 million in funding to accelerate its Quantum Nuova platform, a technology that lets scientists observe cellular processes in real time and reveal biochemical activity linked to disease.

The funding includes a €3 million seed investment led by Cottonwood Technology Fund, with follow-on backing from existing investor QDNL Participations and an angel investor.

In addition, the company received €600,000 from the ONCO-Q programme to support cancer research and €400,000 through the Quantum Forward Challenge for collaborative deployments with research partners.

Most traditional lab methods rely on frozen tissue or cells that are no longer alive, giving scientists only static snapshots of biology.

By contrast, Quantum Nuova lets researchers measure cellular stress and biological changes as they happen in living cells. The platform uses ultra-sensitive fluorescent nanodiamond quantum sensors that detect signals such as oxidative stress, metabolic shifts, and free radical activity, biological processes that play a role in how diseases develop and how cells respond to treatments.

These signals are central to understanding diseases like cancer, sepsis, and chronic inflammatory conditions, but have been difficult to watch directly until now.

With Quantum Nuova, scientists can see how individual cells react to drugs, adapt to stress, or split into different subgroups. That adds a layer of insight beyond what genetics, traditional imaging, or fixed-cell methods can provide.

The technology has already been used to study how FDA-approved drugs affect cells. With the new funding from ONCO-Q, the company plans to apply it specifically to colorectal cancer research, mapping stress and metabolic vulnerabilities in tumour models to support the development of future diagnostics and therapies.

QT Sense was spun out of the University Medical Center Groningen in 2024, building on academic research into quantum sensing and cellular biology.

The team aims to turn what is now a high-performance prototype into a ready-to-deploy discovery platform for laboratories and drug discovery programmes. Planned upgrades include improvements in hardware robustness, throughput, and analytical capabilities.

Early access units are expected to go to strategic partners as part of validation and real-world use cases.

QT Sense is developing a new kind of research tool that lets scientists watch what cells do while they are alive. That’s an important difference from most existing tools, which require cells to be killed or frozen first.

At the core of their approach are tiny particles called nanodiamonds with special defects inside them. When these nanodiamonds are placed near a living cell and exposed to a laser, they glow.

The way they glow changes slightly in response to tiny chemical signals inside the cell, for example, when the cell is under stress or reacting to a drug. QT Sense’s system measures these changes and turns them into data that researchers can interpret.

This means scientists can see how cells behave and respond in real time, instead of looking only at snapshots taken after a cell has been killed.

For disease research and drug development, that matters because many important processes how a cancer cell responds to a treatment or how immune cells react to infection, happen dynamically and can be missed by older methods.

By providing a live view of cell behaviour at the individual cell level, QT Sense’s Quantum Nuova platform could help researchers uncover new clues about how diseases work, which drugs are effective, and how treatments can be improved.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Europe’s largest dedicated deep tech growth fund has taken a major step forward after closing the first tranche of its fundraising effort at €750 million.

The fund, known as Kembara Fund I and managed by Spain-based Mundi Ventures, is aiming for a €1 billion target. It will invest in European companies developing breakthrough technologies in areas such as clean energy, AI, quantum computing, advanced materials, robotics, and space tech.

A cornerstone of the fundraising so far is a €350 million commitment from the European Investment Fund, part of the EU’s attempt to strengthen local growth capital. Additional backing comes from tier-one institutional investors from across Europe.

Kembara was launched in 2023 by Yann de Vries and Javier Santiso, who now lead the fund’s team alongside experienced investors in climate and deep technology.

The leadership team also includes climate tech investor Robert Trezona, deep tech expert Pierre Festal, and former Atomico partner Siraj Khaliq as a strategic advisor. Their combined experience in scaling technology ventures was central to attracting large institutional commitments.

The fund’s strategy targets Series B and C stage rounds, typically a difficult funding stage for deep tech startups in Europe.

Initial checks are planned in the range of €15 million to €40 million per company, with the ability to support follow-on financing that could total up to €100 million per portfolio company.

Europe produces a significant share of global deep tech innovations, but many companies struggle to secure later-stage capital and scale internationally.

Fund managers have described this gap as one of the main obstacles holding back local companies from becoming global leaders. Kembara aims to fill that gap by deploying growth capital at scale and offering support through later rounds.

With €750 million now committed, the fund is actively seeking opportunities to back European startups ready to grow manufacturing, expand abroad, and compete on the global stage.

If the effort reaches its full €1 billion goal, it would mark one of the largest dedicated deep tech funds in the region.
