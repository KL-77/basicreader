            <h2>EPA moves to stop considering economic benefits of cleaner air</h2>

            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2026/01/epa-axes-benefits-from-cost-benefit-analysis-for-air-pollution-limits/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">If you were to do a cost-benefit analysis of your lunch, it would be pretty difficult to do the calculation without the sandwich. But it appears that the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is moving in this same direction—removing the benefit—when it comes to air pollution regulations.

According to a New York Times report based on internal emails and documents—and demonstrated by a recently produced analysis on the EPA website—the EPA is changing its cost-benefit analysis process for common air pollutants. Instead of comparing the economic cost of a certain pollution limit to an estimate of the economic value of the resulting improvements in human health, the EPA will just qualitatively describe health benefits while carefully quantifying economic costs.

Cost-benefit analysis has been a key component of EPA regulations. Any decision to raise or lower air quality standards or pollution limits includes evaluations of the cost that change, like the addition of new pollution control equipment at power plants, would incur, for example.

That cost gets compared to the economic benefits of reduced pollution, which is obviously a bit harder to calculate. At the more tractable end of the spectrum, they can calculate things like health care costs and lost economic productivity for people whose health worsens. Even this requires an estimate of how much of a health impact to expect for a given change in pollution.

But what’s the intrinsic dollar value of someone’s health? Attempts to tackle that thorny question in some practical way result in estimates known as “value of a statistical life.” The EPA has described this as “how much people are willing to pay for small reductions in their risks of dying from adverse health conditions that may be caused by environmental pollution.” Having this number gives us something to hold up next to the cost of that pollution control equipment.

The move to exclude the estimated benefits relates specifically to fine particulate matter smaller than 2.5 micrometers (known as PM2.5) and ozone. This particulate matter, commonly produced by combustion, is small enough to make it through your respiratory system and into your bloodstream. For this reason, it is associated with a host of health impacts even beyond respiratory conditions. That has made research on those impacts the target of anti-regulation advocates who claim scientists exaggerate the harm.

Ozone is also a familiar enough pollutant in smoggy areas to be mentioned in weather forecasts as a warning for people with conditions like asthma. Ozone pollution in the lower atmosphere results from reactions between nitrogen oxides and volatile organic compounds emitted by various anthropogenic sources.

The new EPA language claims that past analyses have failed to adequately represent the scientific uncertainty of the economic value of reducing these pollutants. The new economic impact analysis for stationary combustion turbines, for example, says this “leads the public to believe the Agency has a better understanding of the monetized impacts of exposure to PM2.5 and ozone than in reality.” It continues, “Therefore, to rectify this error, the EPA is no longer monetizing benefits from PM2.5 and ozone but will continue to quantify the emissions until the Agency is confident enough in the modeling to properly monetize those impacts.”

A 2024 regulatory impact analysis for stationary combustion turbines had estimated those benefits at $27–$92 million per year for a tightening of emissions limits.

This is not the first time that these numbers have become political targets. Between 2004 and 2008, the Bush administration reduced the EPA’s value of a statistical life by around 11 percent. But instead of moving numbers to the lower end of scientific estimates, the Trump administration is more aggressively weaponizing scientific uncertainty. Functionally, the logic is that since estimates of benefits vary from large to extremely large, the EPA will default to a value of zero. Only the costs will be calculated, and those numbers are sure to be highlighted as justification for loosening pollution limits.

Currently, documentation for how the EPA previously calculated pollution regulation benefits based on research—including transparent assessments of scientific uncertainties—is still available on the EPA website.</div>

            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-01-13</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2026/01/apple-creator-studio-bundles-final-cut-pro-logic-and-other-apps-for-129-year/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Apple’s professional creative apps have been slower to jump on the subscription bandwagon than those from Adobe or some of its other competitors, but the company is taking a step in that direction today. Starting on January 28, Apple will offer an Apple Creator Studio subscription for $13 a month, or $130 a year. Subscribers will get access to the Mac and (where applicable) iPad versions of Final Cut Pro, Logic Pro, Pixelmator Pro, Motion, Compressor, and MainStage, as well as “intelligent features and premium content” for the Mac, iPad, and iPhone versions of Keynote, Pages, Numbers, and Freeform.

Apple says it will also offer a one-month free trial for the subscription and a discounted version for students at $3 a month, or $30 a year.

Most of the apps also seem to be getting small feature updates to go along with the Creator Studio announcement. Final Cut will get a new Transcript Search feature that will allow you to dig through video footage by searching for specific dialogue, and a new Montage Maker feature “will analyze and edit together a dynamic video based on the best visual moments within the footage.” An updated Logic Pro “helps creators deliver original music for their video content” and adds a synth player to the app’s lineup of “AI Session Players.”

The biggest update is probably a new version of Pixelmator Pro for the iPad, designed around the Apple Pencil accessory. When Apple announced it was acquiring Pixelmator in late 2024, the image and vector editing app was only available for the Mac.

As for Keynote, Pages, and Numbers—in another lifetime, the apps formerly known as “iWork&quot;—the core apps remain free, but the Creator Studio subscription adds “premium templates and themes” for the apps, as well as access to a Content Hub that provides “curated, high-quality photos, graphics, and illustrations” for the apps. Apple is also offering a handful of OpenAI-powered generative features, including upscaling and transformation for existing images, the ability to generate images from text, and a Keynote feature that will create a slide deck from a text outline.

Unlike Adobe, Apple doesn’t offer lower-end subscription tiers that only give you access to individual apps. The Creator Studio package is the best value for creators who use more than one of these apps and who split their time between the Mac and iPhone/iPad versions. Anyone else will inevitably be paying for at least a handful of things you don’t use.

Apple’s subscription prices look reasonable based on what you would pay for an all-access subscription to Adobe’s Creative Cloud apps, though Adobe’s apps also cover web design, photo editing, and some other use cases that Apple’s subscription doesn’t—$780 a year, $105 a month, or $70 a month if you pay for one year’s subscription a month at a time. Apple also allows up to six people to share a single Creator Studio subscription via Family Sharing.

The good news for people who only want one or two apps (or who have already bought the apps, or who simply don’t want yet another subscription) is that the Mac versions of Final Cut Pro, Pixelmator Pro, Logic Pro, Motion, Compressor, and MainStage remain available as standalone App Store purchases. Often, when apps shift to a subscription model, it means the standalone perpetually licensed versions go away—Adobe hasn’t offered standalone versions of Photoshop, Illustrator, Premiere, or its other apps since 2013.

The iPad versions of the apps, including Pixelmator Pro, appear to be subscription-only. Each of the apps has slightly different system requirements, all outlined in a long list of footnotes at the bottom of Apple’s announcement.</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Scott Adams, the creator of the Dilbert comic strip, died today of prostate cancer at 68.

Adams satirized the world of cubicle-based IT and engineering in Dilbert, which at its height appeared in 2,000 daily newspapers and was later anthologized in numerous books.

Dilbert was an engineer with few social skills, but he always knew more than his pointy-haired boss, a caricature of terrible supervisors everywhere who managed to make the life of those who actually knew what they were doing—the engineers—much harder than it needed to be.

In his last two decades, Adams shifted increasingly from the world of comics to politics, where he became increasingly vocal—and abrasive—about his conservative views and his support for Donald Trump.

In the final years of his life, these attitudes cost him most of what he had built with Dilbert. For instance, in 2022, as Rolling Stone recounts, “over 75 newspapers dropped Dilbert after Adams introduced the strip’s first Black character, which he then used as a prop to mock ‘wokeness’ (the character identified as white and LGBTQ+ for work purposes).”

The next year, Adams lost far more papers when he offered commentary on a poll finding that just 53 percent of black Americans agreed with the phrase “It’s OK to be white.” (The phrase appears to have originated from alt-right users of 4chan.)

Adams took to his podcast to discuss the poll. The New York Times summed up his remarks:

“If nearly half of all Blacks are not OK with white people,” [Adams] said on the podcast episode, then they are a “hate group.” He added, “I don’t want to have anything to do with them. And I would say, based on the current way things are going, the best advice I would give to white people is to get the hell away from Black people.”

This resulted in Dilbert‘s cancellations from most major papers. Adams later insisted on his website that he was not, in fact, a “big ol’ racist” and that he was speaking “hyperbolically, of course, because we Americans don’t have an option of staying away from each other.”

But he did still “recommend staying away from any group of Americans that identifies your group as the bad guys, because that puts a target on your back.”

Adams eventually relaunched the strip as the subscription-only Dilbert Reborn, which he said was “too spicy for the general public.” He focused more on his business and political books, including one on Donald Trump and the importance of “persuasion” over facts. He also spent significant time hosting the “Real Coffee with Scott Adams” community he created online.

Adams appeared on Real Coffee streams even as his health collapsed over the past year and he lost feeling in his legs; he was on a Real Coffee stream just two days ago, looking quite ill but still up for joking with his guests about how dumb liberal women must be to go protest right in front of heavily armed, amped-up police.

In a statement published after his death today—and read aloud on his Real Coffee channel by his ex-wife—Adams wrote little about Dilbert. Instead, he focused on his other books, saying that he had tried hard to be “useful” and encouraging his followers to do likewise.

“I had an amazing life,” Adams concluded. “I gave it everything I had.”

He also noted that many of his friends had encouraged him to “find Jesus before I go.” Despite not being a believer, Adams noted that the “risk-reward calculation for doing so looks attractive” and so he included a statement claiming to “accept Jesus Christ as my lord and savior.”

“The part about me not being a believer should be quickly resolved if I wake up in heaven,” he added.</div>

            <h2>This one could use less power: The Jeep Wagoneer S EV</h2>

            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2026/01/this-one-could-use-less-power-the-jeep-wagoneer-s-ev/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">It’s not really accurate to call the Wagoneer S Jeep’s first electric vehicle. For several years now, Europeans have been able to buy the Jeep Avenger, a subcompact crossover that will surely never see American roads. But it is the first electric Jeep designed for American consumption. It’s aimed at the highly competitive midsize SUV segment, which gets ever more crowded even as electrification faces a less certain future here. Indeed, the brand, along with its Stellantis sibling Chrysler, just shelved all its plug-in hybrids, discontinuing them just a few days ago.

Like the little Avenger, the Wagoneer S makes use of one of parent company Stellantis’ purpose-built EV platforms, one shared with the growly-sounding Dodge Charger. At 192.4 inches (4,886 mm) long, 74.8 inches (1,900 mm) wide, and 64.8 inches (1,645 mm) tall, it’s a little larger than cars like the BMW iX3 or Audi Q6 e-tron but a little smaller than domestically designed rivals like the Cadillac Lyriq and Acura ZDX, which have particularly long wheelbases.

I find it a rather handsome car, one that has to marry Jeep’s Wagoneer styling cues with as many wind-smoothing and air-shaping elements as possible. The way the rear wing juts out above the tailgate window reminds me of a ’90s rally hatchback, but it’s the product of the designers and the engineers working on drag reduction. The overall drag coefficient is 0.29, and since Jeep actually publishes the frontal area, too, I can tell you the more important CdA number—where drag is multiplied by the frontal area—is 8.67 sq ft (0.805 m2).

Between the wheels lives a 100.5 kWh lithium-ion battery pack, which translates to 294 miles (473 km) of range, according to the EPA test cycle. When Ars first drove the Wagoneer S in early 2025, it was the more powerful (more expensive) Launch Edition. In mid-December, we spent a week with the $65,200 Wagoneer S Limited, which still boasts 500 hp (400 kW) and 524 lb-ft (710 Nm) from its pair of electric motors. (The Launch Edition uses a pair of equally powerful front and rear drive units, and the Limited uses a less-powerful front unit, giving away 100 hp (75 kW) in the process.)

And in mid-December, the weather was not conducive to getting anywhere close to the EPA test cycle. (Nor getting my own photographs, unfortunately.) Although the Wagoneer S claimed to be averaging 3.2 miles/kWh (19.4 kWh/100 km), according to the display on the dash, the estimated range remaining dropped much faster than the miles I actually drove. The fact that EVs, like all vehicles, lose range in cold weather is not a surprise, but was the car’s brain factoring that into the number it chose to show me?

The average didn’t seem to line up with the range estimate after recharging, either. At 81 percent, the dash showed 198 miles (319 km), not the 238 miles (383 km) my math tells me it should have read under ideal conditions. Still, I have to commend the ease of DC fast charging (via CCS1 port), which took 25 minutes from 36 to 87 percent and offered no resistance or irritation. Many of us remain conditioned to expect problems using public chargers, and I’m still surprised when the process is painless.

The range thing I can excuse because of the below-freezing temperatures. I’m less charitable about the way Jeep calibrated the pedal mapping. One-pedal driving, where the motors regeneratively brake in proportion to the amount the driver lifts their foot from the throttle pedal, is far too jerky and abrupt, particularly to initial inputs. The throttle mapping was even worse in reverse, making me a little scared I’d hit something while backing into a parking space. And this was in the most demure of drive modes, Eco. Sport mode exacerbated the problem more than Auto, and we had no need for either Snow or Sand modes.

Because of the vehicle’s 5,667 lbs (2,570 kg) of curb weight, one can understand the impulse to give the base Wagoneer S 500 hp, but in this instance, perhaps less would have been more. The ride is rather firm, and there’s something of a blind spot behind the driver’s A pillar, but with lift-off regen turned down (so the car only regenerates energy when using the brake pedal) I didn’t find anything objectionable about its road manners on surface streets or the highway.

At the first drive, Jeep’s engineers were keen to point out how little road and exterior noise makes it into the Wagoneer S’s cabin. It’s one of the key attributes that makes driving an EV a superior experience to most other cars, although in this case, it allowed me to hear a hissing sound from behind the dash that wasn’t from the air vents. Other than some mild curiosity and then annoyance, it caused me no actual harm, even if I couldn’t drown it out with a podcast.

As a Stellantis brand, the Wagoneer S uses the Uconnect 5 infotainment system, the Android Automotive OS-based platform that here includes wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto. The touchscreen was responsive, though the capacitive controls for things like seat heaters, which lie either side of the central infotainment screen, were less so. You may notice that when it’s freezing outside and your bum needs warming.

Sadly for Stellantis, nothing about the Wagoneer S is really compelling enough to make it stand out from the crowd, something it really needs to do in such a packed market segment.</div>

            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-01-13</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/culture/2026/01/a-new-titan-emerges-in-monarch-legacy-of-monsters-s2-teaser/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">It’s looking to be a solid year for kaiju fans. Not only are we getting Godzilla Minus Zero in November—sequel to the critically acclaimed Godzilla Minus One (2023)—but Apple TV just released a teaser for the second season of Monarch: Legacy of Monsters, part of Legendary Entertainment’s MonsterVerse, which brought Godzilla, King Kong, and various other monsters (kaiju) created by Toho Co., Ltd into the same fold.

The first season picked up where 2014’s Godzilla left off, specifically the introduction of Project Monarch, a secret organization established in the 1950s to study Godzilla and other kaiju—after attempts to kill Godzilla with nuclear weapons failed. The plot spans three generations and takes place in the 1950s and half a century later. In the first season, two siblings (Kate and Kentaro Randa) follow in their father’s footsteps to uncover their family’s connection to the secretive organization known as Monarch. Naturally, they find themselves in the world of monsters and discover Army officer Lee Shaw (Kurt Russell), a longtime family ally.

In the S1 finale, Godzilla fights off an Ion Dragon, tossing it through a rift back to the Hollow Earth, and Shaw seemingly sacrifices himself to save his colleagues. Per the official S2 premise:

Season two will pick up with the fate of Monarch—and the world—hanging in the balance. The dramatic saga reveals buried secrets that reunite our heroes (and villains) on Kong’s Skull Island, and a new, mysterious village where a mythical Titan rises from the sea. The ripple effects of the past make waves in the present day, blurring the bonds between family, friend and foe—all with the threat of a titan event on the horizon.

In addition to Russell, returning cast members include Wyatt Russell (son of Kurt) as the younger Shaw; Anna Sawai as Cate Randa; Kiersey Clemons as May; Ren Watabe as Kentaro Randa; Joe Tippett as Tim; Elisa Lasowski as Duvall; and Anders Holm playing the younger version of Monarch researcher Bill Randa. Takehiro Hira, Amber Midthunder, Curtiss Cook, Cliff Curtis, Dominique Tipper, and Camilo Jiménez Varón will join the S2 cast as guest stars.

The teaser opens with the elder Shaw sitting up in a bioluminescent forest, clearly having survived the events of the S1 finale. “The world has changed,” he says in a brief voiceover, while Cate announces that “something’s happening.” Specifically, something is stirring, and it’s not our old friends Kong and Godzilla. It seems someone “opened the rift to another world,” and that action will turn out to be a big mistake. And there will be consequences. We don’t get a particularly good look at Titan X in the teaser footage, but that may change when the full-length trailer drops.

The second season of Monarch: Legacy of Monsters premieres on Apple TV on February 27, 2026. New episodes will be released every Friday through May 1, 2026. And the MonsterVerse is still expanding: Apple TV recently greenlit a spinoff prequel series featuring Wyatt Russell’s younger Shaw, set during the Cold War.

            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2026/01/wild-mushrooms-keep-killing-people-in-california-3-dead-35-poisoned/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">A third person has died in a rash of poisonings from wild, foraged mushrooms in California, health officials report.

Since November, a total of 35 people across the state have been poisoned by mushrooms, leading to three people receiving liver transplants in addition to the three deaths. Health officials in Sonoma County reported the latest death last week.

Michael Stacey, Sonoma’s interim health officer, attributed the cases and deaths to an extraordinary boom in the prevalence of death cap mushrooms (Amanita phalloides), noting that in an average year, the state sees fewer than five mushroom poisoning cases.

“Early rains and a mild fall have led to profusion of the toxic death cap mushrooms in Northern California,” Stacey said in the announcement. “Eating wild mushrooms gathered without expert identification can be unsafe. Some harmful varieties closely resemble edible mushrooms, even to experienced foragers.”

In an interview with Ars Technica on Monday, Craig Smollin, medical director for the San Francisco division of the California Poison Control System (CPCS) and an emergency medicine professor at the University of California, San Francisco Medical Center, said that death cap mushrooms tend to flourish between November and March in the state, though not usually to this extent.

Death cap mushrooms get their name because they contain an amatoxin, which inhibits mRNA transcription, leading to a shutdown of protein synthesis and then cell death. This is toxic to any part of the body, but the poisonings are mostly known for causing liver failure. After ingestion, amatoxins are rapidly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and transported to the liver, where they quickly begin destroying the organ.

Amid this year’s surge in death caps and poisonings, CPCS and other health officials have urged people not to forage for mushrooms. Not only can death cap mushrooms look nearly identical to common, edible fungi, no preparation makes them less lethal. Amatoxins are highly stable—cooking, boiling, freezing, or drying has no effect on their toxicity.

Early signs of poisoning usually begin six to 24 hours after eating the mushrooms. Those symptoms can include watery diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and dehydration. A person may experience a brief improvement after that, but potentially fatal liver damage can still develop within 48 to 96 hours.

When those cases occur, the CPCS is usually the first to know, with health care providers contacting the system to consult on case management, Smollin told Ars. Of the 35 cases that have been reported, he knew of one case that is still being treated in a hospital, with the latest cases reported on January 4.

Smollin and the CPCS—along with the state and county health departments—have been working to get the word out about the threat since cases started cropping up in November. “We’ve made some inroads into that,” he said, with case counts seeming to have slowed down before the holidays. But, he said, some of the people who forage for mushrooms are part of immigrant communities who can be harder to reach with health information.

Officials are working on more outreach, including putting up signs in areas where death caps are known to fruit. CPCS is also planning on holding another media event later this week.</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">During the government shutdown in November, the Trump administration suddenly accelerated its plans to shutter over a dozen buildings and around 100 laboratories at NASA’s iconic Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC).

The decision angered Democratic lawmakers, who accused them of going ahead with the “consolidation” effort without even consulting them.

In a November 10 letter addressed to Sean Duffy, who served as NASA’s interim administrator at the time, representative Zoe Lofgren (D-CA) noted that her staff had received “disturbing reports that NASA is directing the imminent closure of laboratories and facilities hosting mission-critical capabilities” at the GSFC.

Of particular concern is the campus’ main library, which was unceremoniously shut down last month, as the New York Times reported on December 31. NASA officials tried to downplay these concerns seemingly to no avail — as former and current staffers, advisors, and union representatives continue to watch in horror as the GSFC closures go on.

NASA insiders cried foul following the library’s closure, warning that critical and still-undigitized materials could be thrown out in what they said were reckless efforts by the Trump administration.

NASA’s new administrator, Jared Isaacman, who was confirmed by the Senate on December 17, was angered by the NYT‘s framing, accusing the newspaper of not fully reflecting the “context NASA shared.” He argued that “at no point is NASA ‘tossing out’ important scientific or historical materials.”

That’s despite later admitting that “some materials with no historical or technical value may not be retained” following a “deliberate review” over a period of 60 days.

NASA press secretary Bethany Stevens chimed in as well, describing the moves at Goddard as a “consolidation, not a closure.”

Isaacman’s comments have seemingly done little to reassure rattled NASA staffers. In a January 7 response spotted by Astronomy, Matt Biggs, the president of the International Federation of Professional and Technical Engineers (IFPTE) — a union that represents thousands of NASA scientists and engineers — accused Isaacman of making “patently false” statements.

“The rapid and haphazard shutdown of the library at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center, reported on by The New York Times, decimated this valuable collection housed at NASA’s largest research library,” Biggs wrote.

The labor union boss also took issue with Isaacman’s argument that the consolidation efforts were part of the 2022 Goddard Master Plan, which dates back to the Biden administration.

“This was not part of some ‘long-planned facilities consolidation’ as Isaacman claims,” Biggs wrote. “The Goddard Master Plan, written in 2022, does not call for the library’s closure. Building 21, which houses the library, was scheduled for renovation, not elimination.”

Futurism has reached out to NASA for clarification. The agency failed to reply to a previous request for comment regarding details of the 2022 Master Plan.

Biggs also accused Isaacman of misleadingly stating on X that “NASA researchers will continue to have access to the scientific information and resources they need to do their work.”

“That’s simply not true,” he wrote. “Much of the material that was available in the library in Greenbelt, Maryland, is copyrighted or unique out-of-print material that cannot or has not been digitized and will no longer be available to researchers.”

It’s a precarious moment, as NASA’s future continues to be debated in Congress. If it were up to the White House, the historic agency would face the largest budget cuts in its 67-year history. Lawmakers, however, have since passed a counteroffer that would leave the agency’s science budget largely unaffected for the fiscal year of 2026 — which technically started in October, as the chaos has dragged on.

It’s a major test of Isaacman’s leadership after taking control of an agency in crisis last month. Insiders remain highly skeptical of the Trump administration’s approach. They say NASA should be opening doors, not closing them, especially as the United States looks to return astronauts to the Moon in the coming years.

“Where is the consolidation?” Biggs wrote. “The material is not being consolidated with other holdings; it is simply being lost to Goddard and to the broader research community, much of it is being sent to storage or to the dumpster.”

“NASA’s scientists and engineers shouldn’t have to be dumpster divers to do their work,” he added. “We expect better from NASA and its managers.”

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">On Sunday, a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket stuffed with cargo carried a brand new NASA telescope into space, where it was observed deploying in Sun-synchronous orbit, the agency later confirmed.

Dubbed Pandora, the orbital observatory is designed to hunt for distant worlds called exoplanets orbiting other stars. And though not nearly as large or expensive as the James Webb Space Telescope, the 17-inch lens packs a specialized punch that’ll help astronomers do something that was unthinkable just a decade or two ago: glean clues from individual exoplanets too remote for even the mighty Webb to pick up on.

Pandora’s mission will last a year, during which it’s expected to complete observations of at least 20 exoplanets — as well, in a novel development, of the stars they orbit.

This will “shatter a barrier,” according to University of Arizona astronomer Daniel Apai, whose team helped build the telescope — helping “remove a source of noise in the data that limits our ability to study small exoplanets in detail and search for life on them,” he wrote in a new piece for The Conversation.

Exoplanets are incredibly difficult to find, and even harder to study. Look up into the night sky, and you will effortlessly spot millions of stars. The first exoplanet, in contrast, wasn’t confirmed until 1992; to this day, astronomers have found only around 6,000 planets around other stars, a task hindered because the little-if-any light they reflect is blown out by that of nearby stars.

To espy distant worlds, astronomers look for when a planet passes in front of its star from our perspective. This is called a transit, and it produces a noticeable dip in the starlight. What’s more, astronomers can analyze the light to tease out properties of the planet it passes through, like the chemicals in its atmosphere. Apai, who is also co-investigator of Pandora, compares this to holding a glass of wine up to a candle: “The light filtering through will show fine details that reveal the quality of the wine.”

Likewise, “by analyzing starlight filtered through the planets’ atmospheres,” he continued, “astronomers can find evidence for water vapor, hydrogen, clouds and even search for evidence of life.”

Astronomers have relied on this clever trick for decades, but recent research, some of it spearheaded by Apai and his colleagues, has shown that it can have a serious flaw. Cooler, volatile regions on the surface of stars, called starspots, can fudge the signals astronomers see, even tricking them into mistaking the water vapor around a star for being present on the planet. Essentially, “we were trying to judge our wine in light of flickering, unstable candles,” Apai said.

That’s where Pandora comes in. Being purpose-built for exoplanet hunting, it can spend far more time observing them than Webb, whose precious time is always in hot demand. Even better, Pandora will observe the stars themselves for 24 hours at a time with infrared and visible light sensors, closely monitoring how the starspots form and evolve. Over the course of its year-long mission, the telescope will revisit each star ten times, racking up hundreds of hours of observations.

“With that information, our Pandora team will be able to figure out how the changes in the stars affect the observed planetary transits,” Apai wrote.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">In less time than it takes to get bored of your new year’s resolution, the planet’s wealthiest people had already blown through their yearly ration of carbon emissions.

We’re not speaking figuratively, either. A new analysis by the Oxfam Foundation found that the world’s richest 1 percent exceeded their fair share of annual carbon emissions just 10 days into the year.

The global “carbon budget” is based off the amount of carbon dioxide that humankind can collectively spew while keeping us within 1.5 degrees Celsius of pre-industrial temperatures. According to Oxfam, the CO2 emissions of the richest 1 percent in just one year will result in an estimated 1.3 million heat-related deaths by the end of the 21st century.

“To stay within the 1.5 degrees limit, the richest 1 percent would have to slash their emissions by 97 percent by 2030,” the study’s press release reads.

Meanwhile, it only took the top 0.1 percent until January 3rd to use up their allotment. Another recent Oxfam report using data from the Stockholm Environment Institute found that the richest 0.1 percent of individuals produce more CO2 pollution in a day than the poorest 50 percent do in a year.

“If everyone emitted like the richest 0.1 percent, the carbon budget would be used up in less than three weeks,” Oxfam implores.

These outrageous figures aren’t just a measure of individual consumption, but of economic power. Since 2024, the top 1 percent has owned more wealth than 95 percent of humanity — not just in cash, but through ownership of powerful assets like mega-corporations and real estate holdings.

The real issue, in other words, isn’t finger wagging about individual consumer choices. The global economy has been built around a vast over-consumption that’s rapidly leading the planet into ecological catastrophe, and the world’s wealthiest are profiting massively. In 2019 for example, an analysis by The Guardian found that just20 fossil fuel companies were responsible for 35 percent of all CO2 and methane pollution since 1965.

Staving off environmental collapse, in other words, will require a difficult confrontation with some of the world’s richest people and the powerful corporations that built their fortunes.

“Time and time again, the research shows that governments have a very clear and simple route to drastically slash carbon emissions and tackle inequality: by targeting the richest polluters,” said Oxfam’s climate change policy lead, Nafkote Dabi. “By cracking down on the gross carbon recklessness of the super-rich, global leaders have an opportunity to put the world back on track for climate targets and unlock net benefits for people and the planet.”

            <div id="article-text">Monkeys are incredible escape artists, known to break out of research labs and even trucks that crashed on the highway.

Private enclosures are also no match for the dexterous and scheming simians. Last week, multiple Vervet monkeys, which are native to sub-Saharan Africa, were spotted roaming the streets of St. Louis, Missouri, alarming officials.

Nobody knows how many of them there are, or where they even came from. It’s also illegal to own Vervet monkeys in the city, so if they’re escaped pets, the owner may not own up to having lost them.

“This is the first time we’ve had a situation dealing with monkeys at large in the city of St. Louis,” Department of Health environmental bureau chief Justen Hauser told NBC News-affiliate KSDK on January 9.

But besides the innate challenges of capturing the agile mammals — as well as an escaped goat also on the loose in the Mound City — the St. Louis Department of Health is being frustrated by a novel hindrance: generative AI slop.

As the Associated Press reports, AI-generated images are complicating rescue efforts because residents have been posting fake images online, claiming to have spotted the monkeys.

“It’s been a lot in regard to AI and what’s genuine and what’s not,” city Department of Health spokesperson Willie Springer told the AP. “People are just having fun. Like, I don’t think anyone means harm.”

AI-generated images circulating on X-formerly-Twitter show the monkeys joining a local gang and hanging out on the stoop. Another shows them drinking out of 40-ounce malt liquor bottles.

While many of the images were intended as a joke, AI-based image generators have advanced to the point where they could easily come up with realistic-looking images of escaped monkeys as well, leading officials on a goose chase.

Springer admitted that they don’t even know how many monkeys are on the loose, saying that there could be up to four of them.

“Original reports suggested there were four animals, but we cannot confirm an actual number at this time, only that there is more than one,” Hauser told the BBC.

Experts at the St. Louis Zoo have since joined the efforts, warning that residents should leave the monkeys alone.

“The monkeys can be intelligent but also unpredictable at times,” Hauser told KSDK last week.

Apart from complicating escaped monkey rescue efforts, generative AI has already turned into a major headache for officials. Case in point, police were forced to issue a warning in October after kids started sending their parents AI-manipulated pictures of them welcoming homeless men into their houses.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">As the final waves of Gen Z — the youngest of whom are currently around 14 — make their way through high school and into colleges and trade schools, some higher education instructors are noticing a severe lack of reading comprehension skills in their students. Schools, in turn, are finding the only path forward is to drastically lower their expectations, for better or worse.

As Pepperdine University literature professor Jessica Hooten Wilson told Fortune in a recent interview, “it’s not even an inability to critically think. It’s an inability to read sentences.”

Wilson is one of the professors who’s had to quietly lower her academic benchmarks thanks to the rise in barely literate Gen Zers graduating American high schools.

Rather than assigning reading outside of class, the literature professor told Fortune she’s adopted a kind of in-class popcorn reading, reciting passages together and discussing them “line by line.” Even that, unfortunately, might be a bit of a stretch for students these days.

“I feel like I am tap dancing and having to read things aloud because there’s no way that anyone read it the night before,” Wilson admitted. “Even when you read it in class with them, there’s so much they can’t process about the very words that are on the page.”

It’s worth pausing here to point out that you can’t really blame younger people for struggling at what were once seen as academic basics. The school system is in shambles, their education was bisected by the COVID pandemic, and they’re been reared in a world that’s increasingly deemphasized reading in favor of videos, voiceovers, and other emerging forms of communication.

Still, the situation is creating practical problems. Timothy O’Malley, professor of theology at the University of Notre Dame, told Fortune that students showing up unprepared for class isn’t necessarily new, but the lowered expectations are.

In the past, O’Malley said he’s assign anywhere from 25 to 40 pages of reading per class. Students would either do it, or they wouldn’t. Nowadays, that much reading would be unthinkable.

“Today, if you assign that amount of reading, they often don’t know what to do,” he explained to Fortune, adding that most Gen Z students are skating by on AI summaries. “They’ve been formed in a kind of scanning approach to reading.”

The news of Gen Z’s waning literacy comes along with a substantial decline in literary acumen among Americans more broadly. Over the last 20 years, for example, the amount of adults reading recreationally in the US has fallen by 40 percent. Meanwhile, a survey of the Program for the International Assessment of Adult Competencies (PIAAC) found that 59 million Americans are reading at a level one competency or below — the lowest level on the PIAAC’s five-point scale.

Whichever way you slice it, younger Americans are barely able to grapple with the written word. Short of major structural changes to the US education system, it’s likely Gen Z won’t be the last generation to experience worse literacy rates than the one that came before.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Commander of multi-trillion dollar computing hardware empire Jensen Huang thinks everyone should stop being so negative about AI and all the ways it could potentially upend civilization, because it’s a “doomer narrative” that’s “not helpful to society,” TechSpot reports.

The Nvidia chief made these remarks during a recent episode of the No Priors podcast, in which he more or less dismissed dire predictions for AI’s future as nothing but science fiction.

“I think we’ve done a lot of damage with very well-respected people who have painted a doomer narrative, end of the world narrative, science fiction narrative,” Huang said. “And I appreciate that many of us grew up and enjoyed science fiction, but it’s not helpful. It’s not helpful to people. It’s not helpful to the industry. It’s not helpful to society. It’s not helpful to the governments.”

“Doomer messages causes policy, and that policy may affect the industry in some way,” he added.

Scrambling his take somewhat Huang then caveated that he doesn’t totally dismiss everything that AI critics have to say.

“It’s too simplistic to say that everything that the doomers are saying are irrelevant,” Huang said. “That’s not true. A lot of very sensible things are being said,” he added, neglecting to provide any examples.

Nvidia’s chips are essential for training AI models, and the rabid demand for them has catapulted the chipmaker to a nearly $5 trillion valuation. To keep the gravy train going, Huang has sometimes been even more of an AI booster than the actual AI companies themselves. When Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei warned that AI could erase half of entry-level white collar jobs in the next five years, Huang countered that Amodei was just fearmongering to make it seem like Anthropic was the only company responsible enough to build AI.

And to be fair to Huang, it’s a good point, with a lot of apocalyptic-sounding warnings of AI risks tending to distract from its more mundane issues. Nonetheless, Huang has made plenty more outlandish AI claims himself, such as reportedly telling his employees that they’re “insane” if they don’t use AI to do everything — nevermind his out-of-touch proclamation that AI won’t take your job, but will instead make you work even harder.

            <h2>A consumer watchdog issued a warning about Google’s AI agent shopping protocol —  Google says she’s wrong</h2>
            <p><strong>TechCrunch | 2026-01-13</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/13/a-consumer-watchdog-issued-a-warning-about-googles-ai-agent-shopping-protocol-google-says-shes-wrong/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Shortly after Google announced its new Universal Commerce Protocol for AI-powered shopping agents, a consumer economics watchdog sounded the alarm.

In a now viral post on X viewed nearly 400,000 times, Lindsay Owens on Sunday wrote, “Big/bad news for consumers. Google is out today with an announcement of how they plan to integrate shopping into their AI offerings including search and Gemini. The plan includes ‘personalized upselling.’ I.e. Analyzing your chat data and using it to overcharge you.”

Owens is executive director of the consumer economics think tank Groundwork Collaborative. Her concern stems from looking at Google’s roadmap, as well as delving into some of its detailed specification docs. The roadmap includes a feature that will support “upselling,” which could help merchants promote more expensive items to AI shopping agents.

She also called out Google’s plans to adjust prices for programs like new-member discounts or loyalty-based pricing, which Google CEO Sundar Pichai described when he announced the new protocol at the National Retail Federation conference.

After TechCrunch inquired about Owens’ allegations, Google both publicly responded on X and spoke with TechCrunch directly to reject the validity of her concerns.

In a post on X, Google responded that, “These claims around pricing are inaccurate. We strictly prohibit merchants from showing prices on Google that are higher than what is reflected on their site, period. 1/ The term “upselling” is not about overcharging. It’s a standard way for retailers to show additional premium product options that people might be interested in. The choice is always with the user on what to buy. 2/ “Direct Offers” is a pilot that enables merchants to offer a *lower* priced deal or add extra services like free shipping — it cannot be used to raise prices.”

In a separate conversation with TechCrunch, a Google spokesperson said that Google’s Business Agent does not have functionality that would allow it to change a retailer’s pricing based on individual data.

Owens also pointed out that Google’s technical documents on handling a shopper’s identity say that: “The scope complexity should be hidden in the consent screen shown to the user.”

The Google spokesperson told TechCrunch that this is not about hiding what the user is agreeing to, but consolidating actions (get, create, update, delete, cancel, complete) instead making a user agree to each one separately.

Even if Owens’ concerns about this particular protocol are a nothingburger as Google asserts, her general premise is still worth some thought.

She is warning that shopping agents built by Big Tech could one day allow merchants to customize pricing based on what they think you are willing to pay after analyzing your AI chats and shopping patterns. This is instead of charging the same price to everyone. She calls it “surveillance pricing.”

Although Google says its agents can’t do such a thing now, it’s also true that Google is, at its heart, an advertising company serving brands and merchants. Last year, a federal court ordered Google to change a number of search business practices after ruling the company was engaged in anticompetitive behavior.

While many of us are excited to welcome a world where we’d have a team of AI agents handling pesky tasks for us (rescheduling doctor’s appointments, researching replacement mini-blinds), it doesn’t take a clairvoyant to see the kinds of abuse that will be possible.

The problem is that the big tech companies that are in the best position to build agentic shopping tools also have the most mixed incentives. Their business rests on serving the sellers and harvesting data on consumers.

That means AI-powered shopping could be a big opportunity for startups building independent tech. We’re seeing the first few sprinkles of AI-powered possibilities. Startups like Dupe, which uses natural language queries to help people find affordable furniture, and Beni, which uses image and text for thrifting fashion, are early entrants in this space.

Until then, the old adage probably holds true: buyer beware.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Ammonia might be the world’s most underappreciated chemical. Without it, crops would go unfertilized and billions of people would starve.

Humans started making ammonia in large amounts just over a century ago, and since then the process used to make it, known as Haber-Bosch, hasn’t changed much. A new startup, Ammobia, says that it has tweaked the Haber-Bosch process to lower the cost by up to 40%.

To prove the technology works on a larger scale, Ammobia has raised a $7.5 million seed round, the company exclusively told TechCrunch. Investors include Air Liquide’s venture arm ALIAD, Chevron Technology Ventures, Chiyoda Corporation, MOL Switch, and Shell Ventures.

If the startup succeeds, it could pave the way for ammonia to be used beyond fertilizer.

Ammonia is viewed by some as an alternative to hydrogen to decarbonize a range of industries. Countries like Japan and South Korea have developed industrial and transportation roadmaps that rely on ammonia. Hydrogen, the other leading contender, isn’t as energy dense and its transportation infrastructure isn’t as well developed as ammonia.

“The big advantage of ammonia is that it’s much easier and more cost-effective to transport and store,” Ammobia co-founder and CEO Karen Baert told TechCrunch. “That opens up a range of opportunities.”

But those opportunities won’t amount to much if ammonia production doesn’t clean up its act. The Haber-Bosch process is one of the world’s big polluters, producing nearly 2% of global greenhouse gases.

To make ammonia, plants using Haber-Bosch employ an iron catalyst to force one molecule of nitrogen to react with three molecules of hydrogen. The reaction requires high heat (500°C) and pressure (around 200 bar or 2,900 psi) to sustain, both of which tend to be supplied by burning fossil fuels.

Fossil fuels also provide some of the gas needed as a feedstock. Nitrogen is easy to obtain — the gas makes up nearly 80% of Earth’s atmosphere — but most hydrogen used in ammonia production is made by using steam to break apart methane molecules (CH4) found in natural gas.

Ammobia’s process runs at around 150°C cooler and at 10x lower pressure. As a result, plants that adopt the technology stand to produce less pollution, even if they don’t ditch fossil fuels.

The startup also says its process saves cost up front. Ammobia can use cheaper pumps and equipment because it doesn’t need to hit high temperatures and pressures.

That could give producers an edge. Because nearly every ammonia producer uses Haber-Bosch, they have typically had only two ways to reduce costs: find a cheaper source of heat or a cheaper source of hydrogen. In places like the U.S., few are cheaper than natural gas.

Ammobia isn’t seeking to change that right away. The startup emphasizes that its process works with any source of hydrogen or heat. But it does have some key differences from traditional Haber-Bosch that could encourage cleaner sources of each.

Because Ammobia’s process runs at lower pressure, it’s easier to ramp production up and down, which could allow renewable developers to take advantage of surplus electricity production to make cheap hydrogen and thus cheap ammonia.

“Our technology is very compatible with renewable energy, that leads to an additional cost reduction because you don’t need to store hydrogen or store electricity,” Baert said. “In these situations, we have the strongest cost advantage.”

The reduced temperature and pressure requirements also allow Ammobia to make its equipment smaller than a typical Haber-Bosch plant. Most ammonia facilities today generate between 1,000 and 3,000 tons per day, while Ammobia’s commercial-scale unit will produce 250 tons per day, Baert said. Customers that need more can install multiple units, she said.

Ammobia did not share details on how it tweaked Haber-Bosch to run at lower temperature and pressure, but there are a few hints out there. The company has a patent pending on a reactor system that incorporates a sorbent to remove ammonia as it is formed to free up space on the catalyst for another reaction to take place. Researchers have also been investigating non-iron catalysts, including manganese nitride, which use less energy to keep the chemical reaction going.

The startup has been operating a small unit for about a year, and the new funding will help the company build a pilot plant that contains all the features of the commercial model on a smaller scale, about 10 tons per day.

“With that modular approach, we can build projects faster, and we can start at a medium scale,” Baert said. “We see that a lot of customers are looking for that type of solution, and there’s no solution out there today.”

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">What does it take to bring a burned-out founder back to the company he sold to Amazon? For Jamie Siminoff of the video doorbell maker Ring, it was the potential of AI — and the Palisades fires that destroyed his garage, the birthplace of Ring itself.

Siminoff’s vision: turn Ring from a video doorbell company into an AI-powered “intelligent assistant” for the entire home and beyond. A handful of new features that advance that goal shipped just ahead of this year’s Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas, including fire alerts, alerts about “unusual events,” conversational AI, facial recognition features, and more. Some of these additions have not been without controversy, as consumers have to grapple with how much privacy they’re giving up in favor of convenience and security. But together, they point to Ring’s latest phase of its business.

“Turn AI backwards — it’s IA, it’s an intelligent assistant,” Siminoff explained in a conversation at CES last week. “We keep doing these things together that are making us smarter, and making it so that, for you, there’s less cognitive load.”

By 2023, five years after selling Ring to Amazon, Siminoff had been running at full throttle for so long that he needed out. “I built the company in my garage…I was there for all of it. We then get to Amazon, and I go even faster — like, more throttle,” Siminoff told TechCrunch. “I didn’t get to Amazon and say, ‘I’m an exited entrepreneur, I’ll just chill out,’” he adds. “I blasted the f**king gas.”

When he later decided to depart the retail giant, he said it was because it felt like the time was right — Ring had delivered its products and was profitable. AI’s advances soon had him rethinking his plans.

Though Siminoff could have done anything, he wasn’t motivated to start something new because the things he was most excited about were those he wanted to build on Ring’s platform.

“AI comes out, and you realize, ‘Oh my God, there’s so much we could do,’” Siminoff said. “And then the fires happened,” he adds, referring to the devastating Palisades Fires that impacted Siminoff’s neighbors and burned the back of his house, destroying the garage where Ring was built.

One of Ring’s new additions, Fire Watch, was inspired by this tragedy. In partnership with the nonprofit fire monitoring organization Watch Duty, Ring customers will be able to opt in to share footage when a massive fire event happens, allowing the organization to build a better map that can be used to help deploy firefighting resources more efficiently. The AI will be used in that case to look for smoke, fire, embers, and more in the shared footage.

Another recently launched AI feature, Search Party, also aims to solve real-world problems as it helps people find their lost pets. That feature is now reuniting one family per day with their dogs — a rate higher than Siminoff expected.

“I had hoped to find one dog by the end of Q1…that was my goal. No one’s ever done anything remotely like this, and I just didn’t know how the AI would work,” he admits. The AI, a sort of “facial recognition for dogs,” tries matching a posted image of a lost pet with Ring footage, which users opt into sharing if they get an alert about a possible match.

Other moves, however, have raised concerns, particularly those that saw the company forging deals with law enforcement. In 2024, Ring ended an earlier set of police partnerships that allowed police to request footage from Ring owners after some customer backlash. But this year, the company moved forward with new deals with companies like Flock Safety and Axon, which reintroduced tools that again allow law enforcement to request images and videos from Ring’s customers.

Siminoff defends the company’s decisions in this space, saying that customers can choose whether or not they want to share their Ring footage.

“The requesting agency doesn’t even know that they asked you,” he says. That is, if police are looking for someone who’s been breaking into cars in a certain geographic area, the alert will go out, and customers can respond if they choose. If customers decline, it’s anonymous.

He also points to the Brown University shooting in December. A combination of surveillance cameras — including Ring’s, Siminoff claims, helped to find the mass shooter.

“Scrutiny is fine…I welcome it, but I’m glad that we stood up to it, because in the Brown shooting, the police needed this,” the founder says. “If we had caved to people’s ‘maybe’s,’ and the scrutiny that they were giving us — [that] I don’t think is correct — the police wouldn’t have had a tool to try to help find this [shooter], and the community would not have had the ability to as easily share in what was happening and as fast.”

Despite the successful capture of the shooting suspect, there are still worries about what the mounting collection of data from private customers means for the landscape of the country. Plus, some are concerned that the data could be misused to go after anyone the government decides to target.

Another AI feature, “Familiar Faces,” has also received pushback from the consumer protection organization EFF, along with a U.S. senator.

The facial recognition feature uses AI to allow Ring to identify and store the faces of people who come in and out of the home on a regular basis, including their names, if provided. This way, you could get an alert that “mom” is at the front door, or that the babysitter arrived, or the kids are home from school, for instance. The feature could also be used to help disable alerts about people whose comings and goings don’t need to be watched closely.

Siminoff defends this, too, as a way for Ring to become more personalized to its users and customize the software to adapt to the unique “fingerprint” of their house. That way, the customer has to interact less with Ring’s products, unless it’s something that requires attention.

He argues that this addition builds on trust with Ring’s customers, rather than undermining it.

“Our products will not be on neighbors’ houses if they don’t trust us….There’s no incentive for us to do something that would lose trust with our neighbors in maintaining their privacy,” Siminoff says. “Anyone — and I would respect it — would take their camera off of their home if they felt like we were violating their privacy.”

But with Ring’s expansion into commercial camera systems, including mounted cameras, a line of sensors, and a solar-powered trailer, also introduced just ahead of CES, the company’s customer base won’t just be neighbors protecting their homes but also businesses, job sites, campuses, festivals, parking lots, and everywhere else.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">A resident of Springfield, Tennessee, is expected to plead guilty to hacking the U.S. Supreme Court’s electronic document filing system dozens of times over several months.

Prosecutors say between August and October 2023, Nicholas Moore, 24, “intentionally accessed a computer without authorization on 25 different days and thereby obtained information from a protected computer,” according to a court document.

As of this writing, there aren’t any more details about exactly what information Moore accessed, nor how it was accessed. Moore is scheduled to plead guilty in court by video link on Friday.

When reached, a spokesperson for the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, which brought the charges against Moore, told TechCrunch that prosecutors cannot provide any more information that hasn’t already been made public.

Spokespeople for the U.S. Department of Justice did not immediately respond to TechCrunch’s request for more information about the case.

Moore’s lawyer, Eugene Ohm, did not respond to an email seeking comment.

The case was first spotted by Court Watch’s Seamus Hughes, a researcher and journalist who monitors court documents.

This is one of several occasions in recent years in which hackers have compromised U.S. court systems. The Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts, which oversees the federal judiciary, said in August that it had strengthened its cybersecurity defenses following a cyberattack on its electronic court records system.

Hackers working for the Russian government were blamed for the breach.

            <h2>Doctors think AI has a place in healthcare – but maybe not as a chatbot</h2>
            <p><strong>TechCrunch | 2026-01-13</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/13/doctors-think-ai-has-a-place-in-healthcare-but-maybe-not-as-a-chatbot/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Dr. Sina Bari, a practicing surgeon and AI healthcare leader at data company iMerit, has seen firsthand how ChatGPT can lead patients astray with faulty medical advice.

“I recently had a patient come in, and when I recommended a medication, they had a dialogue printed out from ChatGPT that said this medication has a 45% chance of pulmonary embolism,” Dr. Bari told TechCrunch.

When Dr. Bari investigated further, he found that the statistic was from a paper about the impact of that medication in a niche subgroup of people with tuberculosis, which didn’t apply to his patient.

And yet, when OpenAI announced its dedicated ChatGPT Health chatbot last week, Dr. Bari felt more excitement than concern.

ChatGPT Health, which will roll out in the coming weeks, allows users to talk to the chatbot about their health in a more private setting, where their messages won’t be used as training data for the underlying AI model.

“I think it’s great,” Dr. Bari said. “It is something that’s already happening, so formalizing it so as to protect patient information and put some safeguards around it […] is going to make it all the more powerful for patients to use.”

Users can get more personalized guidance from ChatGPT Health by uploading their medical records and syncing with apps like Apple Health and MyFitnessPal. For the security-minded, this raises immediate red flags.

“All of a sudden there’s medical data transferring from HIPAA-compliant organizations to non-HIPAA-compliant vendors,” Itai Schwartz, co-founder of data loss prevention firm MIND, told TechCrunch. “So I’m curious to see how the regulators would approach this.”

But the way some industry professionals see it, the cat is already out of the bag. Now, instead of Googling cold symptoms, people are talking to AI chatbots — over 230 million people already talk to ChatGPT about their health each week.

“This was one of the biggest use cases of ChatGPT,” Andrew Brackin, a partner at Gradient who invests in health tech, told TechCrunch. “So it makes a lot of sense that they would want to build a more kind of private, secure, optimized version of ChatGPT for these healthcare questions.”

AI chatbots have a persistent problem with hallucinations, a particularly sensitive issue in healthcare. According to Vectara’s Factual Consistency Evaluation Model, OpenAI’s GPT-5 is more prone to hallucinations than many Google and Anthropic models. But AI companies see the potential to rectify inefficiencies in the healthcare space (Anthropic also announced a health product this week).

For Dr. Nigam Shah, a professor of medicine at Stanford and chief data scientist for Stanford Health Care, the inability of American patients to access care is more urgent than the threat of ChatGPT dispensing poor advice.

“Right now, you go to any health system and you want to meet the primary care doctor — the wait time will be three to six months,” Dr. Shah said. “If your choice is to wait six months for a real doctor, or talk to something that is not a doctor but can do some things for you, which would you pick?”

Dr. Shah thinks a clearer route to introduce AI into healthcare systems comes on the provider side, rather than the patient side.

Medical journals have often reported that administrative tasks can consume about half of a primary care physician’s time, which slashes the number of patients they can see in a given day. If that kind of work could be automated, doctors would be able to see more patients, perhaps reducing the need for people to use tools like ChatGPT Health without additional input from a real doctor.

Dr. Shah leads a team at Stanford that is developing ChatEHR, a software that is built into the electronic health record (EHR) system, allowing clinicians to interact with a patient’s medical records in a more streamlined, efficient manner.

“Making the electronic medical record more user friendly means physicians can spend less time scouring every nook and cranny of it for the information they need,” Dr. Sneha Jain, an early tester of ChatEHR, said in a Stanford Medicine article. “ChatEHR can help them get that information up front so they can spend time on what matters — talking to patients and figuring out what’s going on.”

Anthropic is also working on AI products that can be used on the clinician and insurer sides, rather than just its public-facing Claude chatbot. This week, Anthropic announced Claude for Healthcare by explaining how it could be used to reduce the time spent on tedious administrative tasks, like submitting prior authorization requests to insurance providers.

“Some of you see hundreds, thousands of these prior authorization cases a week,” said Anthropic CPO Mike Krieger in a recent presentation at J.P. Morgan’s Healthcare Conference. “So imagine cutting 20, 30 minutes out of each of them — it’s a dramatic time savings.”

As AI and medicine become more intertwined, there’s an inescapable tension between the two worlds — a doctor’s primary incentive is to help their patients, while tech companies are ultimately accountable to their shareholders, even if their intentions are noble.

“I think that tension is an important one,” Dr. Bari said. “Patients rely on us to be cynical and conservative in order to protect them.”

            <h2>Neo humanoid maker 1X releases world model to help bots learn what they see</h2>
            <p><strong>TechCrunch | 2026-01-13</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/13/neo-humanoid-maker-1x-releases-world-model-to-help-bots-learn-what-they-see/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The robotics company behind the Neo humanoid robot, 1X, has unveiled a new AI model that it says understands the dynamics of the real world and can help bots learn new information on their own.

This physics-based model, called 1X World Model, uses a combination of video and prompts to give Neo robots new abilities. The video allows Neo robots to learn new tasks they weren’t previously trained on, according to 1X.

This release comes as 1X is gearing up to release its Neo humanoids into the home. The company opened up preorders for its humanoids in October with plans to ship the bots this year. A 1X spokesperson declined to share a timeline of when these bots were shipping or share any information regarding how many have been ordered beyond saying preorders exceeded expectations.

“After years of developing our world model and making Neo’s design as close to human as possible, Neo can now learn from internet-scale video and apply that knowledge directly to the physical world,” Bernt Børnich, founder and CEO of 1X said in a statement. “With the ability to transform any prompt into new actions — even without prior examples — this marks the starting point of Neo’s ability to teach itself to master nearly anything you could think to ask.”

Saying that the bot can transform any prompt into a new action is a lofty claim and not entirely accurate; you can’t tell a Neo to drive a car and it will suddenly know how to parallel park, for instance. But there is some learning going on.

1X isn’t saying the world model allows today’s Neo bots to do a new task right away from capturing video and being prompted, a company spokesperson clarified. Instead, the bot takes video data linked to specific prompts and then sends that back into the world model. That model is then fed back into the network of bots to give them a better understanding of the physical world and more know-how.

It also gives users insight into how Neo is thinking of behaving or reacting to a certain prompt. That kind of behavioral information could help 1X train these models to a point where robots will be able to react to a prompt of something they’ve never done before.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The family at the center of Madeline Cash’s first novel, Lost Lambs, is falling apart. Bud and Catherine Flynn have begun a “nonconsensual nonmonogamous spell.” They are too busy scorching each other’s insecurities to cook dinner, more concerned about their own sleeping arrangements than about the eroding bedtimes of their three wayward daughters. Cash’s characters are believable and specific, but contrary to Tolstoy’s famous adage, this unhappy family is, in key respects, like many others. Hemmed in by selfishness, alienation, and subcultural silos, the fracturing Flynns share a kinship with the casts of unhappy-family classics such as Philip Roth’s American Pastoral, Jonathan Franzen’s The Corrections, and Zadie Smith’s White Teeth. But because Lost Lambs is being published in 2026, its unhappiness derives not from Roth’s “indigenous American berserk,” Franzen’s Y2K anxiety, or Smith’s postcolonial pressure cooker, but from the internet.

Online is where Louise, the Flynns’ middle child, meets an Islamic-fundamentalist user named yourstruly. It’s where Harper, the youngest, researches conspiracy theories involving her father’s shadowy tech-billionaire boss, Paul Alabaster. Online discourse lurks behind even offline behavior—Bud and Catherine’s polyamorous phase; the age-gap dalliance of their eldest daughter, Abigail, with an edgy vet nicknamed War Crimes Wes. In Lost Lambs, the internet sabotages a family in much the same way that Napoleon messes things up for the Bezukhovs in Tolstoy’s War and Peace. This makes Cash’s debut one of the first works—and, let’s hope, not the last—to meld the old genre of the unhappy family with a much younger variety: the internet novel.

The proper internet novel, as I see it, is defined by more than just its subject and setting. These are not books in which the internet is a mere plot device, current event, or academic interest (as in Bruce Holsinger’s Culpability and Dave Eggers’s The Circle). Instead, they are fiction about, and often by, people whose offline life is inextricable from their online presence. These are novels that take seriously, and describe intimately, the impact of living with a smartphone and constant access to social media. Such works do not necessarily focus on the experience of scrolling—although they can, as in Jordan Castro’s The Novelist. But they consider the effect of spending four to six hours a day on the same two or three apps (Instagram, TikTok, X). The supremely disaffected narrator of Anika Jade Levy’s Flat Earth, for example, continually cuts her fingers on the broken screen of her phone.

Cash has a great deal of experience with this kind of writing: For a few years, along with Levy, she edited the buzzy literary journal Forever Magazine. Founded in 2020, Forever was consciously built on “the low quality aesthetic of the early digital age” and during Cash’s tenure it sought out writing that reflected it: dry, glib, generally out of conversation with traditional literature. Cash and her colleagues published authors who might have been deemed too rough, too déclassé, and most of all too terminally online for traditional publications. In one short story by Cash, a character rattles off a list of addled misfits that could double as a list of Forever contributors: “temps, sex workers, Satanists, the young and beautiful, intravenous drug users, the people who stand outside of art galleries, industry plants,” and so on until the list ends, provocatively, with “all the same.” Indeed, in those pages, many writers bear evidence of the same flattening affect, probably because their online experiences—often limited to a few apps—are overwhelmingly alike.

Modern fiction can’t make any valid claim to realism without acknowledging that its characters spend perhaps a quarter of their waking hours online. Yet this presents a dilemma: To depict those hours accurately is to risk overfamiliarity, dullness, and disgust. For many, reading is the ultimate offline activity. An internet novel can feel a bit like a soft-serve machine at the gym.

That’s what makes Lost Lambs distinct among internet novels. The reader spends time with someone else’s family, not someone else’s “For You” page. (Even the presence of a family is a change in the genre, in which parents tend to be offstage, nonspeaking, sending money.) We get to see how conspiracy theories and online strangers and vague ideas about open relationships affect the Flynns without the kind of breathless evocations of internet aesthetics and fussy fictional tweets and Instagram posts that afflict novels such as Lauren Oyler’s Fake Accounts and Patricia Lockwood’s No One Is Talking About This. Cash’s prose style has also become emotionally richer: She’s unlikely ever to sound as sincere as Sally Rooney, but she has evolved beyond the cutting stories in her 2023 short-story collection, Earth Angel. She seems to have found a middle distance between dismissiveness and sentimentality.

In addition to sparing readers a confrontation with the luminous now of the Notification Center, Cash also liberates the Flynns from the always-too-late pop-culture references that constrain many internet novels. Instead of Ritalin or Xanax, Abigail takes “blues,” “yellows,” even “purples” (a risky one—originally “manufactured to bring down the rat population”). Instead of investigating Jeffrey Epstein or Peter Thiel, Harper is obsessed with Alabaster, who has his own sinister quirks. Louise meets her Islamist friend, yourstruly, in a chat room for middle children, not on r/redscarepod. (The book is full of fresh coinages: Page Turner’s bookshop, the British pub Olive or Twist, the ice-cream parlor Anne Frank’s Dairy.) This is a novel about the corrosive effect of modern life that doesn’t feel corrosive. Cash is gentle with us—perhaps too gentle.

In classic novels of family crisis, such as John Updike’s Rabbit, Run and Richard Yates’s Revolutionary Road, husbands or wives or children die. Without spoiling too much, there isn’t much to spoil; Lost Lambs has no such mortal stakes. This aversion to physical harm might look at first like fidelity to real life, in which mortal danger is rare. But in Cash’s world, it feels implausible. In the novel’s most preposterous sequence, Bud—who has been continually threatening to kill himself—reveals that he has a long-standing fantasy of being with a woman less attractive than his wife. More head-scratchers follow. Villains, in Cash’s novel, can’t seem to commit to villainy. Irreconcilable differences are resolved by short periods of self-reflection. The overall effect is one of deflation. In the novel, Cash writes: “When a lamb strays, it’s usually lost to wolves, vulnerable without its flock. But sometimes, just sometimes, if it’s lucky, it finds a new one.” That’s not luck—it’s wishful thinking. Cash hasn’t so much tamed the savagery of the internet as turned on parental controls.

Read: Patricia Lockwood’s mind-opening experience of long COVID

Lost Lambs has accomplished something major; it reads to me like the first internet novel with the potential for broad offline appeal. But in joining the Zadie Smiths and Jonathan Franzens of the world, Cash has undermined the tension that makes such novels work. Families can form a strong protective unit, but the price of that bond is that when they fail, they become a grief engine. When a child runs off, when a husband sleeps around, when secrets are whispered or truths shouted, people get hurt in a way they never could have alone. That’s why the stakes in family novels seem so high: because other people get hurt too. Cash flinches from this cascade of consequences.

This is a shame, because a great family novel of the internet would need to take online danger seriously. People really do get lost to conspiracy theories. They get messed up chatting with strangers. The internet has the ability to create assassins and sway elections and destroy families, to waste our time and wreck our life. This is the limitation of Cash’s book, and the lesson for the next novelist who aspires to write a grown-up internet novel: It doesn’t mean anything to be a lost lamb in a world without wolves.

            <h2>A Romance That Actually Takes Sex Seriously</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-01-13</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/2026/01/heated-rivalry-sex-scene/685596/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">When I first heard of Heated Rivalry, I didn’t think much about it. The words Canadian ice-hockey TV series slid into my brain and slipped right back out. But a week later, approximately everyone I’d ever met wanted to talk about it. People kept telling me that it was fun, sweet, and addicting. Most of all, they emphasized that it was really smutty. Every recommendation seemed to come with a warning to not watch with my parents.

The show, which is based on a set of romance novels by Rachel Reid, follows rival hockey stars: Shane Hollander (played by Hudson Williams), the well-mannered guy next door on Montreal’s team; and Ilya Rozanov (Connor Storrie), a cocky bad-boy Russian playing for Boston. They’re supposed to hate each other—but then they start secretly sleeping together, which gets in the way of the animosity a bit. In the past weeks, Heated Rivalry has become an absolute phenomenon. It’s the most-watched original show for the Canadian streamer Crave since the platform launched in 2014, and after HBO Max acquired the series for U.S. viewing, it became the highest-rated live-action show that streamer has obtained since its start, in 2020. Heated Rivalry and the reasons for its success have been dissected at length by culture, “romantasy,” and LGBTQ critics—as well as on major hockey podcasts. At bars across the United States, live watch parties were packed, squeals resounding.

I can’t say for sure why the show caught on so widely. But since the finale aired last month, I’ve been thinking about one element that I really respect: The series knows the value of good sex scenes—not for thrills or laughs or snapshots of a fleeting moment but for illustrating how the characters’ relationship develops, touch by touch, over time. It takes sex seriously in an era when few shows do.

When I first started watching, I was surprised to find that it wasn’t explicit in quite the way I’d imagined. The viewer never sees anything that graphic; there’s no Game of Thrones–style full-frontal nudity, though one does glimpse a generous amount of butt cheek. What feels unique about Heated Rivalry, rather, is that it lets its sex scenes play out, sometimes sticking with its characters nearly from the beginning of their encounter until the end in real time. Even without showing everything, the series communicates the nitty-gritty of what’s going on: which acts, how long they take, who’s leading whom, whether the lovers are gentle or giggly or a little combative and when that tone subtly shifts. Sometimes you hear no music at all, just the sound of kissing or heavy breathing.

So many shows and movies introduce a sex scene only to cut straight to the next morning, imparting merely the understanding that the deed has been done. Even Sex and the City, which was boundary-pushing when it started in 1998, frequently skipped to Carrie Bradshaw smoking a postcoital cigarette, the expression on her face the first clue as to whether the interaction had gone well or not. Sexual specifics, when they were given, were used most often as a punch line. (The guy with “funky spunk,” needless to say, shows up in only one episode.)

The 2010s series Girls did have plentiful sex scenes with unflinching intimate detail—often featuring main characters, revealing something of their relationship. Much of it was horrible sex, though, there to make viewers cackle or cringe. (A 2017 Slate article helpfully ranked all 53 Girls sex scenes by “how Girls it was.” No. 1 features Lena Dunham’s character, Hannah, struggling to get her tights off; her then-situationship Adam, played by Adam Driver, saying he’ll “consider” putting on a condom; and Hannah talking through the act until Adam suggests that they “play the quiet game.”) Many shows seem more comfortable defining what makes sex memorably bad than what makes it great or complicated or mediocre. And a lot of them, romances included, don’t even go that far.

That’s a shame—because for one thing, to put it plainly, a lot of people have sex. When a TV critic once asked Dunham why Hannah was naked so often on Girls, she responded, “It’s a realistic expression of what it’s like to be alive.” And she’s right: Life doesn’t stop happening when clothes come off; it keeps going, and what occurs in that time tends to be pretty important for how a relationship plays out. It’s worth taking a genuine interest in.

A frank sex scene can provide a wealth of information about two characters and the dynamics between them. On Heated Rivalry, Shane and Ilya’s romantic arc builds sporadically over the course of more than eight years. They live in different cities, and they can meet up—briefly and surreptitiously—only when hockey events bring their teams together. But a lot changes with each hookup. Their first time, Shane has never been with a man before, but Ilya has: He leads gently but firmly, with a thumb in Shane’s mouth and then a kiss on his cheek. In a later scene, when the two still-closeted men have been sneaking around for years and are trying to quash the growing feelings they can’t afford to have, the sex is somewhat kinkier but less emotional. (It starts with Ilya ordering Shane around and ends with Shane leaving the hotel confused, drafting a text he never sends: “we didn’t even kiss.”) Near the end of the season, when the two have confessed to falling for each other, one sex scene is particularly playful—it happens while Shane is on the phone—and Williams has said that it was meant to depict the “humor and levity” you might have with someone you’re really comfortable with. If the viewer knew only that sex happened on these occasions, they’d be missing so much of what’s unfolded between Shane and Ilya—especially because these men are extremely bad at talking openly about their situation. “If you skip the sex scenes,” Williams said in one interview, “you miss the story.”

This was all intentional. The show’s intimacy coordinator, Chala Hunter, has said that part of her job was meticulously diagramming each episode in a master spreadsheet to track “the narrative arc that plays out through the intimacy.” She’d regularly check in with Jacob Tierney, the screenwriter and director, to discuss whether a sensual interaction fit the moment: how long the characters had been together, how they’d be feeling emotionally and physically. And even as a professional intimacy coordinator who’s worked on plenty of sets, she found that actually portraying sex rather than “insinuating or implying it” felt new, she told Elle last month: “I was like, Oh, we’re being very specific and fairly explicit here, but to be honest, I found it refreshing and different.”

The fact of Heated Rivalry’s immense popularity suggests that viewers loved it too. That might seem unexpected: Sex has become less and less common on-screen, according to The Ringer’s 2024 analysis of 40,000 films. The same year, The Economist found that sexually explicit content in the 250 highest-grossing U.S. movies had fallen by nearly 40 percent since 2000, while drug references, violence, and profanity had hovered at stable levels. And some surveys have found that audiences have little appetite for sex scenes. In a 2023 UCLA poll, roughly half of 1,500 respondents, ages 13 to 24, said that sex isn’t needed in most shows and movies; more than half said they want more platonic relationships depicted. The next year, the market-research firm Talker Research surveyed 2,000 Americans and found that 43 percent of respondents think sex scenes don’t add to a story; more than 40 percent of the Gen Z participants said they turn a movie off once they hit a sex scene.

Statistics like these have become part of a discussion about whether the culture is growing prudish and puritanical. Some commentators think that young people are not only having less sex but are also less open to sex altogether. (Others argue that they’re so accustomed to porn that media depictions bore in comparison.) When I read those reports, though, what I sense is largely just fatigue: a frustration with a perceived overreliance on romance and the tropes the genre often entails. Many of the UCLA participants agreed that romantic-relationship depictions “often feel unnatural, forced, or toxic.” They were on guard against what they saw as stereotypes, tired of seeing protagonists always end up together and overfull on love triangles.

On the last front, I can’t relate; personally, I want every movie to resemble Challengers. Generally speaking, though, I understand feeling bored with the same old affairs. Especially in straight romances, the signals are so familiar, you can get up to grab popcorn: the shed clothes draped over an armchair, a shirtless man hovering over his lover, feet tangled at the end of the bed. Then it’s morning; the woman is always inexplicably waking up with a shirt on, or rising to grab a robe.

Perhaps Heated Rivalry is a sign that many people are game for sexy content when it’s done creatively or thoughtfully—when it serves a purpose. If audiences haven’t been enjoying sex scenes, well, maybe that’s because most sex scenes haven’t been doing their job.</div>

            <h2>Julian Barnes Says Goodbye to the Novel</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-01-13</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/2026/02/julian-barnes-departures/685507/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">“Yes—oh, dear, yes—the novel tells a story,” E. M. Forster wrote. “I wish that it was not so.” Julian Barnes has confessed that as a young man reading Aspects of the Novel, he found this sentiment “feeble” and responded impatiently, “If you aren’t up to telling a story, why write a novel?” Barnes, who turned 80 in January, now sings a different tune, and anyway, Forster’s wish was long ago granted. The literary novel of today is quite free from conventional storytelling, and ironically (irony is one of his specialties), Barnes got busy loosening the bonds early in his career. He’s still at it: His brief new novel, Departure(s), offers only a sketchy storyline, mixed with memoir and thoughts on memory. An extended farewell, an author’s valedictory flourish, the whole package is a culmination of sorts, shimmering with his silky, erudite prose; beneath the suave surface is an earnest investigation into the mysterious ways of the human heart.

Check out more from this issue and find your next story to read.

The scant plot in Departure(s)—a “true story” the narrator swore he wouldn’t tell—tracks the two-part romance of Stephen and Jean, friends of his at university who fell in love, broke up when they graduated, then connected again in late middle age after Stephen asked Julian to reach out to Jean. Like many of Barnes’s 14 previous novels—including his most famous, Flaubert’s Parrot (1984), and the Man Booker Prize winner, The Sense of an Ending (2011)—Departure(s) tells a love story filtered through the consciousness of a ruminative, standoffish man preoccupied with something other than the love at stake.

In the earlier novels, Barnes is given a fictional identity; in the new one, the author speaks to us directly, blithely confident that a skeptical realist with a restless mind probing familiar yet essential experiences—how the brain works, what happens as we age—is all the entertainment we require. He shrugs off the romance: “Couple fail to make one another happy, well, turn the page.” But one should never disregard the way love works (or doesn’t) in his books. In the words of Philip Larkin (a Barnes favorite), love is the “element / That spreads through other lives like a tree / And sways them on in a sort of sense.”

When love is absent, bottled up, interrupted, or misdirected, Barnes is at his best. One-tenth of Flaubert’s Parrot is heartache, but it’s buried under the other nine-tenths, a rambling miscellany of Flaubert factoids. The novel reads at times like an eccentric biographical essay, at times like a cranky compendium of pet peeves. Yet the reader is peripherally aware that the narrator, Geoffrey Braithwaite, indulges his literary obsession so as to distract himself (and us) from the tragedy of his wife’s death. After dragging his feet for most of the book, he at last addresses his loss, his despair, in a short chapter called “Pure Story.” A melancholy emotional logic holds Flaubert’s Parrot together, not least the parallels between the unfaithful Ellen Braithwaite and Emma Bovary, whose name is synonymous with adulterous passion.

Geoffrey warns against the smug certainty of those who think that by trawling for facts they can catch the essence of a life, whether Flaubert’s or Ellen’s. (“My wife: someone I feel I understand less well than a foreign writer dead for a hundred years.”) In an oft-quoted passage, he considers a fishing net with Olympian detachment:

He adds, “You can do the same with a biography.” You can do the same with a novel.

Once you start looking for holes in Barnes’s books, they open up everywhere: what’s unknown, withheld, or willfully ignored. Absence itself—absence of love, absence of the beloved—becomes a crucial locus of meaning. In Flaubert’s Parrot, for instance, the longer Geoffrey delays telling us about Ellen, the more we sense how much she meant to him. In Departure(s), there’s a 40-year gap between the first time Stephen and Jean try to love each other (which a young, love-starved Barnes experienced as “romanticism-by-proxy”) and the second, “rekindled” attempt, reluctantly facilitated by Barnes. Both Stephen and Jean tell him, “This will be my last chance of happiness.” They marry—a church wedding!—and then break up for good. A decade or so later, they’re both dead. Breaking his vow, Barnes writes about them, exposing Stephen as a spurned romantic and Jean as incapable of accepting or returning his love. Barnes says it’s what he’s been after “all my writing life: the whole story.”

The whole /hole pun is surely intended. The brief, truncated narrative leaves Barnes space to ruminate on the blanks in our memory. He glides past a truism (“As we age, forgotten memories of childhood often return to us”) and delivers a startling prognosis: “At the same time, our grasp of the middle years decays. This hasn’t happened to me yet, but I can imagine how it might develop as senescence takes hold.” In other words, he adds, if we live long enough, our lives—his, mine, yours—may be reduced (like Stephen’s and Jean’s) “to a story with a large hole in the middle.” Meanwhile, scattered references point to the defining event of those four missing decades, at least in Barnes’s own life: In 1979, he married Pat Kavanagh, a literary agent six years his senior; three decades later she died, just weeks after being diagnosed with a malignant brain tumor.

In 2013, he published Levels of Life, a celebration of his love for her and an anatomy of his mourning. “I was thirty-two when we met, sixty-two when she died. The heart of my life; the life of my heart.” An essay, a short story, and a memoir squeezed together in one slim volume, the book defies formal categorization, but the sum of those disparate parts is an achingly honest dirge:

Her absence imposes a very specific form of loneliness—“not so much loneliness as her-lessness.”

He broods about memory and aging in Departure(s), of course he does: He has a new partner, Rachel, who’s 18 years his junior. He reveals as well that he was diagnosed in 2020 with a rare blood cancer that can be managed with a daily dose of chemo, but not cured. Before he knew his cancer wouldn’t kill him, he began making notes for what he thought would be his final book, to which he gave a provisional, “archly self-pitying” title: Jules Was. He is “heavily afraid,” according to one note, of the grief his demise will “impose on R”—a replay, perhaps, of what he himself experienced.

Read: It’s hard to change your mind. Julian Barnes’s new book asks if you should even try.

Setting aside the pain of Kavanagh’s death, almost 20 years ago now, Barnes acknowledges the luck of his life, particularly his professional success. The oldest in the all-male scrum of his generation’s celebrated British novelists (Martin Amis, Kazuo Ishiguro, Ian McEwan, Salman Rushdie), he has enjoyed a prize-strewn career. And he has had happy second chances, unlike the unfortunate Stephen and Jean, and unlike Tony Webster, the narrator of The Sense of an Ending, the first book Barnes published after Kavanagh died.

Tony, too, is offered the opportunity to rekindle an old flame. Again, there’s a 40-year gap. A solitary divorced retiree who puzzles over familiar Barnesian preoccupations (time, memory, aging), Tony comes into contact with an ex-girlfriend, Veronica. He can’t let go of their backstory. Soon after they split, she took up with one of his close friends—who shortly thereafter killed himself. Now Tony tries to make sense of two endings: the breakup and the friend’s suicide. But instead of a rekindling, or even a moment of clarity, he’s left with a muddle. “You just don’t get it,” Veronica tells him. “But then you never did.”

“Our life is not our life,” Tony tells himself, “merely the story we have told about our life.” He acknowledges that his own is utterly bland: his career, unspecified; his marriage, tepid; his daughter, emotionally distant. “What did I know of life,” he asks, “I who had lived so carefully? Who had neither won nor lost, but just let life happen to him?” The romance, the life-and-death passion in this sad, sad novel, takes place out of sight, its contours unknown—except that, of course, none of it involves poor Tony, who gradually then suddenly becomes aware of what’s missing. Barnes wrings emotion—sharp, sustained anguish—from remorse at love’s absence.

Even in his nonfiction, Barnes points to the holes all around us. In Nothing to Be Frightened Of (2008), a sophisticated, meandering meditation on mortality and his own timor mortis (published, coincidentally, a few months before Kavanagh’s death), he keeps the “nothing” of death front and center. And in The Man in the Red Coat (2019), a boldly unconventional biography of Samuel Pozzi, a pioneering French gynecologist who was a lifelong friend and sometime lover of the immortal Sarah Bernhardt, Barnes repeatedly taunts us with the limits of our knowledge: “We cannot know.”

What is the string that binds the holes in a biography or a novel? Memory, yes: “We all know that memory is identity,” Barnes writes in Departure(s); “take away memory and what do we have?” Yet he also reminds us that memory is the “place where degradation and embellishment overlap.” To compensate for degradation and to make embellishment pleasing, we call upon imagination and style (that erudite prose), and the comforting continuities of narrative. Add to all of that a kind of attentive engagement—Barnes prefers a more active word, “attending,” a knack for noticing details that beg to be preserved—and you might manage to knit together a coherent pattern of events and images, a history. You might even give shape to a love story. “Writers believe in the patterns their words make,” he tells us in Levels of Life. “We cannot, I think, survive without such belief.”

The big-picture pattern that emerges from Barnes’s shelf of books is the mystery of love, which he addresses directly in 20-odd pages of A History of the World in 10½ Chapters (1989), an early book of linked stories. The half chapter, aptly named “Parenthesis,” has achieved a modest cult following, undoubtedly because of passages as clever and un-saccharine as this one:

In the same unsentimental vein, he insists that we must be “precise” about love, by which he means, “attending to the heart, its pulses, its certainties, its truth, its power—and its imperfections.” That’s a good description of the task that Barnes has taken on as a writer. A final admonition: “We must believe in love, just as we must believe in free will and objective truth.”

At the beginning of Departure(s), Barnes tries out a new perspective. He’s fascinated by an extreme form of what’s known as involuntary autobiographical memory (IAM), in which a particular action triggers a cascade of memories of all the times that action has been performed in the past. Here’s an example: What if saying “I love you,” whether you meant it or not, triggered an IAM? He asks, “How would you face the record—the chronological record—of all your lies, hypocrisies, cruelties?” What if one sexual fantasy triggered an IAM onslaught, including all the “inadmissible, sluttish adulteries of the heart which we have chosen to suppress”?

There are memories we suppress and then there’s the echoing emptiness of everything we’ve simply forgotten, a vanished immensity, the selves we’ve left behind, the many millions of skin cells our body sloughs off every day. Faced with the choice of string or hole—a relentless deluge of recovered memory or the pathos of forgetting, of shedding thoughts that seemed momentous a moment ago—which would you choose?

At the end of Departure(s), Barnes announces, “This will definitely be my last book—my official departure,” and he imagines a “final conversation,” conjuring the image of

“What do you make of that couple,” he asks us: “married, or having an affair?” Spotting an old couple holding hands, he says, “that always gets to me.” He offers other observations, “ordinary, conversational mutterings.” He sees, out of the corner of his eye, that we share his “attendingness.” He rests his hand on our forearm—a brief touch—and slips away. His parting injunction: “No, don’t stop looking.”

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">In 1928, Chief Buffalo Child Long Lance published a memoir that caused a sensation in the literary world. It opened with his earliest memory: Barely a year old, he was riding in a moss baby carrier on his mother’s back, surrounded by women and horses. His mother’s hand was bleeding, and she was crying. Long Lance wrote that when he’d recounted this memory to his aunt years later, he’d been told that he was remembering the “exciting aftermath of an Indian fight” in which his uncle Iron Blanket had just been killed by the Blackfeet Tribe’s traditional enemies, the Crow. His mother’s hand was bleeding because she had amputated her own finger in mourning.

His next memory was of falling off a horse at age 4. “From this incident on,” he wrote, “I remember things distinctly. I remember moving about over the prairies from camp to camp.” Born to a Blackfeet warrior in the late 19th century, during the final days of the “free” Blackfeet in northern Montana and southern Alberta, Long Lance wrote that his father’s generation was facing “the mystery of the future in relation to the coming of the White Man.”

Long Lance attended the infamous Carlisle Indian Industrial School in Pennsylvania, and received a presidential appointment to West Point. Eager to fight in the Great War even before America entered the conflict, he traveled to Montreal in 1916 to enlist in the Canadian Expeditionary Force, fought at Vimy Ridge, and was twice wounded. The second wound knocked him out of combat, but not—he would later boast—before he’d risen to the rank of captain and was awarded the Croix de Guerre.

By the time his memoir came out, Long Lance had traveled a great distance—from the High Plains to New York high society. One night in the winter of 1928, he spotted Natacha Rambova, the ex-wife of the silent-film star Rudolph Valentino, in the Crystal Room of the Ritz-Carlton. According to his biographer, Donald B. Smith, Long Lance approached Rambova and asked her to dance. They began an affair, but she wasn’t the only woman in his life: Long Lance was also linked to the actor Mildred McCoy, the singer Vivian Hart, and Princess Alexandra Victoria of the House of Glücksburg.

Long Lance was shockingly handsome, broad-shouldered and wasp-waisted, with smooth, coppery skin and thick black hair. He did calisthenics and gymnastics every morning and wrestling when he could find partners. He had boxed with the world heavyweight champion Jack Dempsey and been a training partner for the legendary Olympian Jim Thorpe, a member of the Sac and Fox and Potawatomi Nations.

When Long Lance’s memoir was published, the planned initial run of 3,000 copies was bumped to 10,000 on the strength of early reads and the endorsement of The Saturday Evening Post ’s Irvin S. Cobb, then one of the most influential journalists in the world. (Cobb also wrote the book’s foreword.) Reviews of the memoir were fulsome. The New Orleans Times-Picayune declared it “the most important Americana offered this year.” The Philadelphia Public Ledger averred that Long Lance had written “a gorgeous saga of the Indian Race.” In the New York Herald Tribune, an anthropologist called the book an “unusually faithful account” of a Native American’s childhood and early manhood. Across the Atlantic, The New Statesman declared that the memoir “rings true; no outsider could explain so clearly how the Indians felt.”

By 1930, Long Lance’s celebrity extended far beyond New York ballrooms and newspaper book reviews: He starred in a feature film, The Silent Enemy, about a famine that strikes a fictionalized version of the Ojibwe Tribe. The B. F. Goodrich Company planned to produce an experimental canvas running shoe modeled after a Plains Indian moccasin like those Long Lance had worn.

But just two years later, he would be found dead on a rich white woman’s estate in California, killed by a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head. By this point he was nearly penniless, exiled from high society, and besieged by accusations that he wasn’t who he said he was—that he’d leveraged a bogus identity to rise in the world.

Before I left the Leech Lake Ojibwe reservation in northern Minnesota, I didn’t really think or talk much about being Native. My “Indianness” wasn’t important to me. When I was growing up, my Ojibwe mother—and also my Austrian Jewish father—made sure that I harvested wild rice in the fall, hunted in the winter, tapped maple trees for sugar in the spring, and fished and picked berries in the summer. I hated all that stuff, which I experienced as opportunities for my parents to comment incessantly on my laziness, my poor work ethic, my dearth of skill when jigging rice or boiling down maple sap or sitting stand for deer.

Only after I moved away did questions about being Indian begin to preoccupy me. When I started at Princeton in 1988, I was surprised by how few people had heard of my tribe, let alone my reservation. And as a light-skinned nerd who loved Dungeons & Dragons, grew up middle-class, and didn’t “look” Indian, I failed to scan as Native to most people. I began to feel that a battle was being waged between how I was seen from the outside and what I felt myself to be on the inside—even as I wasn’t yet sure who I felt myself to be on the inside. It became clear to me that, as long as you look iconographically Native—copper skin, black hair, a thousand-yard stare aimed at the past—white people will invariably believe any damn thing you have to say.

From the September 2022 issue: David Treuer on how Reservation Dogs exploded the myths of Native American life

So I tried to build a Native identity from the outside in. I got the belt buckle, wore the bolo tie, grew my hair long, listened to R. Carlos Nakai’s flute recordings and John Trudell’s spoken-word CDs. I began to cultivate “life on the rez” stories that I shared with anyone who would listen. I found myself becoming outspoken—and vicious—about what was Indian and what was not; who was “legit” and who was “fake”; what was “Ojibwe” and what was “not Ojibwe.” I realize now that all of this frenzy around identity was less a politics than a pathology.

But for Native Americans, race is not merely a social construct. It is a legal category from which rights and monetary benefits flow. Whether or not you are enrolled in a federally recognized tribe determines where and how you can hunt, whether you qualify for certain scholarships, where you can live (and whether you get housing subsidies), whether you get a share of tribal profits, and in some cases which academic or government jobs you’re given special consideration for. But to be an enrolled member of a tribe is almost entirely contingent on “blood quantum”—the percentage of one’s lineage that can be traced to tribal ancestors.

I don’t qualify for enrollment in my tribe. To be enrolled in the Minnesota Chippewa Tribe, you need a quantum of one-quarter Minnesota Chippewa Tribe blood, as well as one parent who is an enrolled member. (Chippewa is a French corruption of the original Ojibwe.) Even though my mother grew up on Leech Lake and devoted her life to the tribe, first as a nurse and then as a lawyer and tribal-court judge, her official blood quantum is only one-quarter. Her grandmother was recorded as half Ojibwe, even though she was full, and her father was on the rolls as a quarter when he was really half. I should be enrolled. The fact that I should be but am not turned the idea of Native blood into an obsession for me, at least for a while, because it was a measure of my Indianness that I couldn’t change.

Within my lifetime, the question of what constitutes Native identity and qualifies one for enrollment has only grown more fraught. For much of U.S. history, being Indian was not a helpful thing; the opposite, in fact, was true. But in the 1970s, new federal laws changed the experience of Indianness for many Native people. So much so that by the time I was a teenager, having Indian identity was no longer necessarily something that would hold you back, but a material benefit. It might help you find a job, win an arts grant, or entitle you to substantial income from casino profits.

Inevitably, this led to outsiders—verifiably non-Indian folks—trying to claim Indian identity. Jobs, especially in academia, have gone to people feigning Native identity, such as Andrea Smith (who claims to be Cherokee despite no credible evidence that she is) at UC Riverside and Elizabeth Hoover (who claimed to be Mohawk and Mi’kmaq, and later apologized when she discovered she was not) at UC Berkeley. The same is true in publishing: Margaret Seltzer sold her memoir, Love and Consequences, on the basis of its details about her grisly childhood as a Native kid in foster care in Los Angeles—but Seltzer was not Native and grew up with a loving family in Sherman Oaks. Nativeness presented as trauma porn (but with the potential for a hopeful outcome!) can be lucrative.

For Natives, it is enraging that, now that being Indian finally has significant, remunerative opportunities attached to it, imposters have swooped in to take what is—by blood, history, and suffering—rightfully ours. By about 2010, these imposters had come to be known as Pretendians, and they sparked a countermovement of Pretendian-hunting. A coterie of self-styled guardians of Indian identity arose, largely on social media, to call out interlopers. I understood the impulse. I’d done my share of such policing as a young man before I realized that it was the product of insecurity about my own Indian identity, and grew out of it.

The Pretendian hunters were not always interested in a full accounting of the facts before pronouncing a person legitimately Native or a fraud. Many quite authentic Natives were targeted for banishment, and the ugly infighting their work inspired was covered widely—by the standards of Indian affairs—in the American media, which saw the battles as part of the larger identity wars raging across the nation in the new millennium.

For now, the Pretendian hunts have quieted a little, the hunters having lost credibility because of their overzealousness, and the country having grown weary of identity politics. But it’s not just the Pretendian hunters who have culled the rolls. Some small tribes, finding themselves suddenly rich from casino revenue, have been disenrolling members, so as to ensure more money for those who remain. Other tribes—typically large ones with substantial diasporas—have also been cleaning their enrollment records, less to hoard money than to mitigate tribal anxieties about acculturation. One way to feel more “Indian” is by performing a racial alchemy that effectively turns liminal folks into white people. All of this has given new urgency to old and confounding questions: Who gets to be Indian, and who decides?

For a long time, the federal government wasn’t much interested in defining who was and wasn’t Indian. From the country’s birth, Native people were largely outside its embrace. In 1787, the Founders explicitly excluded Native people from the U.S. Constitution. “Congress shall have Power,” Article I declares, to “regulate Commerce with foreign Nations, and among the several States, and with the Indian Tribes.” We were understood to belong to our own sovereign tribal nations (then numbering well over 750), many of which were geographically inside yet civically separate from the growing American republic. We had our own laws, systems of government, and criteria for citizenship.

The government began bearing down harder on who was or wasn’t Native after the passage of the Indian Removal Act of 1830, which resulted in the Trail of Tears and the forced displacement of about 100,000 Indians from east of the Mississippi to the Indian territories from 1830 to 1850. By 1887, the U.S. government cared a great deal about who belonged to those tribal nations. That year, Congress passed the Dawes Act, otherwise known as the General Allotment Act. It was, even for that time, a remarkably cynical piece of legislation. To solve what the government persisted in calling “the Indian problem,” the president was given permission to break up communally held tribal land into smaller parcels that would be “allotted” to individual Indians and heads of households. The stated reason for the law was that private ownership and farming would induce Indians to give up the tribal cultures and practices that—in the legislators’ thinking—were holding back Native people and the country as a whole, keeping both Indian and white Americans from their full economic potential. In other words, the official rationale for the Dawes Act was economic salvation through assimilation.

But the true intent of the legislation was to allow the state to steal Indian land and escape treaty obligations. At the time, Native nations held roughly 150 million acres in aggregate, but the number of individuals who would receive allotments (generally set at 160 acres each) was so small that millions of acres of “surplus” land would be left open to white settlement. And once all of the Indians became farmers and stopped being Indian, the lawmakers’ thinking went, the tribes would disintegrate. The government would at last be free of its treaty obligations to sovereign Indian nations—because there would be no nations left.

From the May 2021 issue: National parks should belong to Native Americans

To figure out who got an allotment, the government had to determine who was actually Indian. So the government began enrolling Indians in tribes, using blood (gleaned via census data) as a metric.

In 1924, Congress passed the Indian Citizenship Act, also known as the Snyder Act, which turned all noncitizen Indians born within the territorial limits of the United States into “citizens of the United States,” but without affecting “the right of any Indian to tribal or other property.”

That final clause of the act was crucial and hard-won. It meant that even after having the mantle of American citizenship thrown over us, whether we wanted it or not, we didn’t have to fully give up being legally Indian. We effectively had dual citizenship: Indians were, finally, American en masse, and yet we remained members of our sovereign Indian nations.

The legislation was controversial among some Native nations. The Onondaga, members of the Iroquois Confederacy, wrote a letter to President Calvin Coolidge declaring that the Snyder Act was treasonous because it compelled their citizens to become American without their consent. For nearly 150 years, Indians had been barred from being part of the American franchise; now we were forced to be American.

In the early 1970s, President Richard Nixon announced a new shift toward tribal self-determination. In theory, this policy meant that tribes could decide for themselves whom to enroll. In practice, this has only complicated matters: Although tribes now have more autonomy to tend to their own collective futures, they must do so in ways that don’t threaten federal recognition. Navigating between autonomy and nonexistence is not straightforward. In 1994, when the Blackfeet Nation in Montana toyed with ending blood quantum as a metric for enrollment, an official from the Bureau of Indian Affairs warned that if the tribe “diluted” its membership, it might discover that it had “ ‘self-determined’ its sovereignty away.”

In November 1928, Long Lance arrived in Ontario to begin shooting The Silent Enemy, a part-talkie film that follows a band of Indians in Canada as they struggle against starvation. During filming, according to Donald Smith’s biography, Long Lance entertained the Ojibwe actors and crew with war dances and traditional storytelling, often accompanied by an assistant director—Ilya Tolstoy, the Russian novelist’s grandson.

One of his co-stars was Chauncey Yellow Robe. Yellow Robe had been born into the Sičháŋǧu Oyáte in 1867, and had been 9 years old at the time of the Battle of the Little Bighorn. His maternal great-uncle was none other than Sitting Bull. In 1883, at age 15 or 16, he, too, had been taken to the Carlisle Indian boarding school. That’s where he was when roughly 300 of his relatives, mostly women and children, were gunned down at Wounded Knee Creek in 1890. Now, as Yellow Robe watched Long Lance, he was disturbed: Something about the Blackfeet chief seemed off. Long Lance’s dancing didn’t look at all to him like the dancing of Plains tribes.

When Yellow Robe returned to New York, he contacted the Bureau of Indian Affairs and told them of his suspicions. It turned out that the office was already investigating questions about Long Lance’s origins.

When Long Lance’s memoir was published, the Cosmopolitan Book Corporation sent a copy to Charles Burke, the U.S. commissioner of Indian affairs. “The emotional reaction of those who have read it is enthusiastically favorable,” the cover letter read. “It would interest us very much to know what you think of ‘Long Lance.’ ”

Intrigued by the book but skeptical about its author, Burke started writing letters. First, he contacted the U.S. Department of War, asking about Long Lance’s career at West Point. Two days later, he heard back that Long Lance had failed the West Point entrance exams, and never attended. Burke wrote more letters. From an Indigenous commissioner in Canada, Burke learned that Long Lance was a Blackfeet chief only in an “honorary capacity.”

Was he Blackfeet at all? Burke received a letter from Percy Little Dog, the interpreter for one of the tribes that make up the Blackfoot Confederacy. “We never saw or heard a thing about ‘Buffalo Child Long Lance’ until the winter of 1922,” Little Dog wrote. “He is not a Blood Indian, and has no tribal rights on the Reserve. We have heard he was a Cherokee Indian, but do not know definitely who he is or where he came from.” The former superintendent of the Carlisle Indian boarding school wrote as well, providing Long Lance’s real name, Sylvester Long, and saying that he had attended the school—but as a Cherokee, not a Blackfeet.

In November 1929, Long Lance gave a talk at the American Museum of Natural History titled “An Indian’s Story of His People.” Two months later, on January 28, 1930, he attended a banquet for the Poetry Society of America at the Biltmore Hotel. After dinner, he regaled America’s literary elite with a performance of Plains Indian sign language, and in front of hundreds, he recited his own Blackfeet death song, which went, in part: “The Outward Trail is no longer dark, / I see—I understand: / There is no life, there is no death; / I shall walk on a trail of stars.”

A week after that, he was at the Mutual Life Building at the corner of Broadway and Liberty, where he had been summoned to meet with William Chanler, a producer and the legal counsel for The Silent Enemy. When Long Lance opened the door to the office, Chanler greeted him by saying “Hello, Sylvester.” Long Lance looked at Chanler steadily. “Sylvester? Who’s Sylvester?” Chanler was enraged: “You’re Sylvester—Sylvester Long. You come from North Carolina, and you’re not a blood Indian.”

The charade was exposed. Long Lance was not Blackfeet. He was not even a full-blooded Indian. He had not grown up on the Plains. He had not hunted bison with his people. He had not been a captain in the Canadian army. He had not won the Croix de Guerre.

As Donald Smith recounts in Long Lance: The True Story of an Imposter, Sylvester Long was born on December 1, 1890, in Winston (today Winston-Salem), North Carolina. In the city registry, his family was listed as Black. His father, Joe Long, a janitor at the West End School, had been born into slavery in 1853. His mother, Sallie Long, had been born into slavery as well. His brother Abe Long was the manager of the all-Black balcony at the local theater. Beginning at age 6, Sylvester had walked two miles each way to the Depot Street School for Negroes. And although it was true that he had attended the Carlisle Indian boarding school, his application said that he was half Cherokee, not Blackfeet.

After that February day in 1930, Long Lance’s life fell apart, at first gradually and then suddenly. He was invited to fewer and fewer society functions and received a lot less attention from princesses and starlets; there would be no more lectures, no more movies, and no more books. Public reaction to his fraudulence was ferocious. When Irvin Cobb, the Saturday Evening Post writer who’d touted his book, got the news, he was incensed. “To think that we had him here in the house,” he said, ever the son of Paducah, Kentucky. “We’re so ashamed! We entertained a nigger.”

As he retreated from public life, Long Lance eked out a quiet existence in New York until the early spring of 1931, when Anita Baldwin, an eccentric millionaire heiress, offered him a job as her secretary and bodyguard on an extended trip to Europe in the fall. Baldwin would later say publicly that while in Europe, Long Lance showed himself to be “a man of estimable character and gentlemanly in all respects.”

But in her private journals and correspondence, she recorded that he drank heavily and made several suicide attempts. When the trip ended, Baldwin left him in New York and continued on to California, where she lived. He wrote pleading letters asking to be rehired. She promised that if he stopped drinking and chasing women, she would pay for flying lessons and give him a plane. He traveled to California, where he rented a hotel room in Glendale and visited Baldwin’s estate often, but he sensed that she was wary of him. He wasn’t wrong: According to Smith, she was having Long Lance followed by a private detective, because he was drinking and womanizing again, and spending time with an unsavory crowd.

On March 19, 1932, after going to a movie, Long Lance told a taxi driver to take him to Baldwin’s estate. He sat with Baldwin in the library. According to her, he seemed “abrupt, very depressed and non-communicative.” Not long after she retired to bed, she heard a gunshot. Baldwin’s watchman ran to the library, where according to Smith’s biography he found Long Lance “slumped on a leather settee,” his legs straight out in front of him, his head flung back, and a Colt .45 revolver in his right hand.

In May 2024, I traveled to East Glacier, Montana, on the western edge of the Blackfeet Nation, for lunch at the Two Medicine Grill. I was there to meet a Blackfeet named Robert Hall. When he arrived, it took him a few minutes to get from the door to where I was sitting because so many people in the restaurant seemed to be a friend or a relative—the server, the cook, a couple of diners.

I wanted to talk with Hall about the scourge of Pretendians. In 2020, Hall had waded into an online trolling battle with anti-Pretendians, concerned that in their zealotry for rooting out fake Indians, these crusaders had become “toxic.” Pretendian-hunting, in his view, “had become this thing where if you don’t agree with the hunters, you’re not Indian anymore.” All of which, in Hall’s view, just deepens Indian wounds regarding identity and tribal belonging.

When Hall got to my table and we started talking, I noted that he spoke in that clipped, laconic way I’d come to recognize as very Blackfeet. He has spent almost his whole life on the reservation. “I’ll die here, I hope,” he said. “My whole paradigm is ‘Blackfeet rez.’ ”

But he dislikes the anti-Pretendian crusading because it deepens the focus on blood quantum. And he has a number of objections to the blood quantum: It’s a colonial system whose purpose was to disappear us, it’s divisive and destructive for the Indian community, and its use erodes tribal sovereignty. Reliance on blood quantum forces us to fight one another, and count our fractions, when we should be fighting together for a healthier future. The issue is also deeply personal for Hall—his tribal council has granted and rescinded his own enrollment, all based on evolving interpretations of old documents about an ancestor. That ancestor, his great-great-grandmother Mary Ground, was originally put down in the rolls as full-blooded Blackfeet. But, according to Hall, the rolls burned in a fire, and when the tribe composed them again, Mary Ground was put down as quarter-blooded. So Hall was deemed unqualified. Not long after that, though, his family found additional documents, and he was finally enrolled.

And then, in January 2024—as it happened, the day after Lily Gladstone, the actor of mixed Blackfeet descent who won a Golden Globe for her role in Killers of the Flower Moon, publicly thanked Hall for the Blackfoot-language instruction he’d given her—the council rescinded his enrollment. After that, Hall obtained still more information and documentation, including an affidavit from his paternal grandfather, whose blood had never been accounted for. “We take that back to the council,” he recalled, “and it passed. And we’re back on.”

“I spent 37 years not enrolled,” Hall told me. “Man, being enrolled was like finally regaining a limb you’d never had. And then the council comes along and chops it off. And they say, ‘Oh, it’s nothing personal.’ But it’s all personal.”

The vagaries of blood quantum mean that it’s possible to be a “card carrying” Indian without ever having lived on a reservation or knowing any other Indians. It’s possible to be an enrolled Indian and have absolutely no knowledge of your culture. It’s possible to be 100 percent Native by blood and not be enrolled. And it’s possible to grow up Indian—steeped in your tribal ways, a speaker of your language, a keeper of cultural knowledge—and yet still be, in the eyes of the government, white.

Hall understands that Pretendianism isn’t some imaginary problem; it’s a real issue. “It’s like, to be in our special-hat club, you need this special hat. And then someone from fucking Pennsylvania finds a hat in their basement and puts it on and is like, ‘Oh, hey, look at me—I’m you!’ and you’re like, ‘Ummmm, are you?’ ” This is the trap we find ourselves in: “Blood matters, even as a spiritual connection to our ancestors.”

As we talked, I felt an old sadness well up in me. By 1900, only a precious few Blackfeet had made it through the gantlet of smallpox, warfare, starvation, and Christianization. Closer to home, my mother’s family survived the effects of Indian boarding schools, abuse, neglect, violence, and crushing poverty. We Natives, collectively, have survived a tremendous amount. Across the nation, many of us won the survival lottery, in some cases with our traditions and our kin in place, and here we are in the 2020s, wasting those winnings measuring one another’s blood quantum and fighting with one another in pointless internecine cultural battles.

After college, I moved back home to Leech Lake. I realized that I had missed harvesting wild rice, and fishing, and tapping maple trees. I learned how to trap beaver and pine marten. I had missed my family, my tribe, the land, all of which meant more to me than the thin regard of white people. My older brother, Anton, who had been a history professor in Wisconsin, moved home as well. He fell in love with, and was quickly dedicated to, our Ojibwe cultural practices, attending Big Drum ceremonies and medicine dances. Both of us started studying the Ojibwe language. Both of us realized, for different reasons and in different ways, that we liked our people, and that we liked being Indian as much as or more than we liked being anything else. And I discovered that the more immersed I felt in Indianness, as a way of life lived in community rather than an imagined construct, the less I worried about what other people thought of how I looked, or whether I was enrolled.

For some—like Robert Hall and my brother and me—the question of whether we are properly Indian or not, tribally enrolled or not, is principally a matter of identity and belonging, of being allowed to be who we really are by dint of our histories and our attachment to the community and our affinity for tribal folkways and culture, as well as our blood. Enrollment status doesn’t directly affect our ability to feed our families, or get medical care, or have a roof over our head in our own community. For others, however, being disenrolled has consequences more tangible than the loss of belonging.

Consider Sally Brownfield, who lived for years as a member of the Squaxin Island Tribe west of Tacoma, Washington, working as a teacher who specialized in Indigenous education. Her mother, Sally Selvidge, spent decades working to ensure access to good health care for the tribe; the tribe’s health clinic is named for Selvidge, who died in 1994. But Brownfield herself, who served on the tribe’s enrollment committee until last year, can no longer get subsidized care at her mother’s clinic, as The Seattle Times reported last spring, because she and dozens of other tribe members were recently disenrolled. In her case, the tribe says that, although she possesses Indigenous blood via her mother, they don’t descend from a select list of Squaxin ancestors, and so never should have been enrolled in the first place. Nor can Brownfield vote in Squaxin elections, or harvest clams on the Salish Sea beaches where her ancestors did so for generations. Others who were disenrolled alongside her lost their subsidized tribal housing.

Something similar unfolded not far away about a decade ago, in Washington’s Cascade Mountains, near the Canadian border, where the Nooksack Tribe disenrolled 306 members. Tribal officials say “the 306” (as they came to be called) were mostly descended from a different tribe, and didn’t meet the one-quarter blood quantum required for enrollment. All 306 lost their official Nooksack enrollment for want of sufficient documentation, even though many had lived in the community for decades, if not their whole life. At least 20 were evicted from their family homes on tribal property.

The irony is that we Natives—who can lay authentic claim to being the first Americans, and who were then deemed officially not American by the Constitution before being forced to be American by American law—are now at the mercy of our own tribal nations when it comes to whether we can be considered truly Indian, with all the psychological and practical benefits that identity confers. We’ve suffered enough over the centuries, at the hands of European powers and then the federal government of the United States. To now endure censure by overzealous anti-Pretendian crusaders, and banishment by bureaucratic tribal decrees and reactionary blood-quantum rules, feels particularly bitter.

I first wrote about Long Lance nearly 20 years ago. I ended that story by revealing his fraudulent Blackfeet identity. In my account, he was Black, not Native. Case closed.

But the case turned out not to be closed. He was Indian after all. The evidence was there, but I’d blinded myself to it because I still saw identity in black and white—or Black and Red.

As Smith detailed in Long Lance: The True Story of an Imposter, Long Lance’s mother, Sallie, had been born into slavery. Her grandfather Robert Carson was “a small-time slave owner.” Carson had been wild in his youth, but evidently “settled down after he bought a handsome Indian woman” at an auction.

Among the 20 children that Indian woman gave birth to was Long Lance’s grandmother Adeline, born in 1848. Long Lance’s maternal grandfather was a North Carolina state senator who visited Carson’s plantation often and fathered Sallie and another child with Adeline.

It turns out that Long Lance’s father, too, had Indian blood. He was born into slavery in 1853 and early on in life was separated from his mother. When Joe Long finally found his mother in Alabama, some 40 years later, she told him that his father was white—and that she herself was Cherokee. When Joe died, his obituary stated that he was “a member of the Catawba tribe of Indians.” In 1887, Joe and Sallie Long moved to Winston, North Carolina, where the racial codes were much more rigid: The only two categories for human beings were “white” and “colored.” The Longs fell squarely into the “colored” category. Were they Native? Yes. Were they Black? Also yes. Were they white? Yes again.

Long Lance elided the Black in favor of the Native. When he entered Carlisle, he was listed as half Cherokee and half Croatan. Over time, he slid away from his “mixed” identity; when he received a West Point appointment from President Woodrow Wilson, he claimed to be full-blooded Cherokee. After settling in Canada following World War I—he genuinely was wounded in battle—he began sliding away from his Cherokee-ness, too, eventually giving it up in favor of being Blackfeet.

I think I can understand the slide, and the lies it entailed. One identity, perhaps the most “authentic” one, is a story of enslavement and rape and subjugation, the details of which would relegate Long Lance to life as a second-class citizen. Another, almost entirely fictive identity would afford him freedom and adulation.

It’s no wonder that Long Lance wanted to be a kind of Indian that didn’t exist—except in dime-store novels and, later, movies—and probably never had; that he mined the mineral of racial nostalgia for a past that never was. He mined it until it was played out for him, and he died alone, unemployed, bereft, and heartbroken. Not as Cherokee or Blackfeet or Black or even white—but as perhaps one of the most American identities of all: self-made.

            <h2>How to Wake the Constitution’s Sleeping Giant</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-01-13</strong></p>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Jill Lepore’s stellar cover story rightly described the Constitution’s amendment provision as a “sleeping giant.” The process is indeed in sound slumber today, but history suggests that it will wake up. Amendments, history shows, come in cycles. The political factors that trigger those cycles always differ. But what precedes each wave of amendments is consistent: worsening polarization that escalates to violence, butting up against conventional wisdom that insists that amendments are not a viable solution. We are sadly at such a point, much as we were a decade or more before the first amendments of the Progressive era were ratified in 1913. Just prior, at the turn of the century, then-scholar Woodrow Wilson, the editorial board of The Washington Post, and the award-winning historian Herman Ames all claimed that the Constitution was unamendable. They were wrong.

We should hope that the violence that finally stirs the giant will be less destructive than in cycles past. But I think we haven’t yet hit the low point in our current spiral. We’re getting closer: The civic pressures causing our descent are foundational, which means we must confront the Constitution as we reach the bottom. Our return ascent will include repair, correction, and hopefully some amendments.

I appreciated Jill Lepore’s call for overdue amendments in “How Originalism Killed the Constitution.” It is clear from our imperial presidency, gridlocked Congress, and captured courts that America suffers from a deep constitutional rot. Potential amendments could include establishing equal rights for women, abolishing the Electoral College, overturning Citizens United, and banning gerrymandering. The United States could even attempt more dramatic revisions, such as establishing an elected attorney general, like many states, or imposing a wealth cap, as theorized by Thomas Paine and Plato.

The article describes the Constitution’s amendment provision as a “sleeping giant.” But how do we wake it? Voters in Missouri, a state referenced in the article for its long history of constitutional amendment, have utilized referenda and initiatives to drive constitutional change for more than a century. Most recently, in November 2024, Missouri voters chose to enshrine women’s fundamental right to reproductive freedom in our state constitution. About 25 states have one or both of these processes, which have been found to promote accountable and responsive government.

In this context, one idea suggested in the 1980s by then-Representative Dick Gephardt of Missouri should be revisited: the national advisory referendum. A proposed amendment, placed on a midterm or presidential ballot by an act of Congress, would not be binding, but the result would gauge whether the amendment has sufficient nationwide support to meet the Constitution’s Article V state-ratification requirement.

Unlike most other modern democracies, America has never held a national vote on a question other than who should occupy the presidency and vice presidency. Perhaps this is one of the sources of the chief executive’s extraordinary power. But what if the solution to our nation’s democratic dysfunction is more democracy, not less?

As I read Jill Lepore’s article, I kept looking for a mention of the one word consistently missed in the Constitution. For years, I have been hoping that the “originalists” would stop and read the first sentence—“We the People of the United States, in Order to form a more perfect Union …”—and realize they have been overlooking the word more.

The Framers did not believe that America was perfect and that its Constitution ought to be cast in stone, only that America was more perfect than what had come before. They could easily have written “in Order to form a perfect Union,” but they didn’t. Instead, they understood that what they wrote was never going to be perfect and would need to adapt to endure. Thus, Article V.

Only by ignoring that word can originalists conclude that the Constitution is, as Justice Antonin Scalia put it, “dead, dead, dead.”

This summer, while visiting Washington, D.C., with my son, we went inside the Jefferson Memorial and read the inscriptions on the walls out loud. One quote struck me deeply: “I am not an advocate for frequent changes in laws and constitutions, but laws and institutions must go hand in hand with the progress of the human mind. As that becomes more developed, more enlightened, as new discoveries are made, new truths discovered and manners and opinions change, with the change of circumstances, institutions must advance also to keep pace with the times. We might as well require a man to wear still the coat which fitted him when a boy as civilized society to remain ever under the regimen of their barbarous ancestors.”

This excerpt from a letter by Thomas Jefferson resonated with me immediately. Jefferson—the original originalist—would have been appalled at some of our recent Supreme Court decisions.

Jill Lepore states that the more than 400 federal judges appointed by Ronald Reagan were “screened for their views on abortion.” I was Reagan’s last appointment to the United States Court of Appeals, but I was not asked for mine. I was warned that I would be, but the closest his staff got was the following exchange:

“Judge Nygaard, do you have a judicial philosophy?”

“I will. In criminal matters, I am basically Cartesian. And in civil and other matters, I am definitely Aristotelian.”

They asked no follow-up questions. I doubt they knew what I was talking about. In full disclosure, I am not sure even I knew!

Richard L. Nygaard United States Circuit Judge North East, Pa.

In high school I had a wonderfully pudgy and eccentric tenth-grade history teacher. He taught in a second-story room with a wide plate-glass window that looked out at a mountain in the distance, whose silhouette resembled a sleeping giant. In the middle of an especially boring lesson—the accidental presidency of John Tyler, say—he’d lumber across the room and haul himself up onto the radiator beneath the window and lie down on it, exactly lining up his belly with the mountain’s summit, his head and feet with its smaller peaks: he, the giant. He’d sigh, settling in, and then he’d appear to nod off. We’d wait, a little nervously. And then suddenly and in a whirl of motion you could not imagine as within the capacity of so large and old and ungainly a man, he’d roll off the radiator, leap to his feet, and cry, “The giant wakes!” And it would be very thrilling, and we’d all snap to attention, and he’d move on and—somehow, somehow—he’d make the fall of the Whig Party gripping. In short, I heartily agree with these readers, and I hereby offer my assurance that the whole point of my sleeping-giant analogy with reference to Article V of the Constitution, aside from being a nod to a beloved teacher, is that somehow, somehow, and I suspect one day soon, “the giant will wake” !

In this month’s cover story, “Is This What Patriotism Looks Like?”, Jamie Thompson tells the stories of Thomas Webster, a retired New York City policeman who attacked the Capitol on January 6, 2021, and Noah Rathbun, a police officer whom Webster assaulted. (Webster has since been pardoned by Donald Trump.) Thompson also profiles Daniel Hodges, a police officer who was pinned against a doorway and beaten while attempting to prevent the mob from breaching the building. For our cover image, we selected a photograph of a group of officers attempting to hold back a crowd of rioters outside the Capitol.

“Just How Real Should Colonial Williamsburg Be?” (November) originally stated that Thomas Jefferson and Patrick Henry once lived in the Governor’s Palace in Colonial Williamsburg. In fact, the residence at Colonial Williamsburg is a reconstruction of the original building. “The New German War Machine” (January) originally stated that the Bendlerblock once served as the headquarters of the Wehrmacht. In fact, it served as the headquarters of several divisions of the German military.

            <h2>How the Supreme Court Broke Congress</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-01-13</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/2026/01/supreme-court-congress-powers/685590/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Two dynamics are fundamentally reshaping the structure and functioning of the American government. The first, which is quite well known, is Congress’s decline. The second, perhaps somewhat less appreciated but no less significant, is the Supreme Court’s ascent—its expansion of its power into areas previously thought to be off-limits.

These dynamics share a root cause: the partisan polarization that has reshaped American politics over the past four decades. But the connection is deeper and more complex than that. Whereas polarization weakened Congress, it emboldened the Court to dismantle laws and, in the process, undermine Congress’s ability to make laws at all, reinforcing Congress’s sclerosis.

The citizens and commentators shouting from the sidelines that Congress must act, fix itself, and reclaim its intended role are not wrong. But they miss that the Court has made doing so nearly impossible. The practical result is a Congress caught between paralysis and policing, mostly incapable of translating collective judgment into law and, when it does manage to do so, vulnerable to having its most significant accomplishments—civil-rights enforcement, voting protections, campaign-finance reform, administrative authority—erased by judicial decree. The judiciary, long conceptualized as a check on legislative excess, is now defined by its own excess against legislative charge.

The Court’s usurpation runs deeper than the invalidation of statutes with a liberal cast, though there has been plenty of that. It is curbing a competing source of constitutional interpretation, kneecapping an institution that speaks with its own voice and channels public commitments into durable legal forms. In the name of protecting the balance of powers, the Court is radically refashioning that balance, claiming for itself the final and exclusive authority not only over which laws stand but over who gets to say what the Constitution means.

The relationship between Congress and the Court has never been static. The Framers imagined a system in which “ambition counteracts ambition”—rival institutions checking each other through distinct roles and visions of the public good. That Hamiltonian-Madisonian ideal has waxed and waned over American history. Clashes have at times given way to collaboration. Today it has yielded something new.

The modern Court’s campaign against Congress began in the late 20th century, amid rising partisanship and institutional upheaval. The Gingrich revolution, ushered into Washington by the 1994 midterm election, reshaped Congress, accelerating party sorting into distant ideological camps and normalizing scorched-earth tactics. The Court was not immune to these forces. Following the Bork confirmation debacle—when the Senate, closely split along party lines, rejected Robert Bork’s nomination to the Court—justices tended to reach the bench only after passing ideological screening systems and bruising Senate battles. Some had worked as political operatives during Republican presidencies or, later, in the bitter Florida recount. As interbranch rivalry morphed into systemic partisan competition, a judiciary dominated by Republican appointees began consolidating its authority at Congress’s expense.

This turn against Congress reflected less a principled commitment to limited federal legislative power than an opposition to what Congress was doing through the New Deal and Great Society. Particularly at risk were congressional assertions of its own interpretation of the Fourteenth Amendment and efforts to enforce that vision in civil-rights laws, as well as regulations of interstate commerce. These were domains where conservative activists had long sought to roll policies back, yet lacked the public support to do so. Jurisprudence accomplished what democratic politics could not.

In the mid-’90s, the Rehnquist Court broke with half a century of post–New Deal deference to federal legislation. In United States v. Lopez (1995), five Republican-appointed justices struck down the Gun-Free School Zones Act, finding that the near-unanimously approved law exceeded Congress’s commerce-clause power. It was the first time since Carter v. Carter Coal Co., issued in 1936 during an epic clash with Franklin D. Roosevelt, that the Court invalidated a federal statute on this basis. Lawmakers had once built bipartisan legislative coalitions; a newly conservative Court now moved to undo them.

Lopez announced an ambition to undercut a larger dynamic separate from the substantive issues of guns and schools: a Congress responsive to public sentiment, attentive to contemporary problems, and transmuting public opinion into concrete action. This ambition grew out of the structural insulation of the Court. Partisan control of Congress rose and fell with elections, whereas control of the Court did not, at least not as directly. As a result, the conservative Court held an advantage in long-game constitutional struggles: its capacity to wait out temporary liberal congressional majorities.

In quick succession, the Court began circumscribing Congress’s ability to define rights and act on its constitutional imagination. Five years after Lopez, in United States v. Morrison (2000), the same five justices struck down important parts of the Violence Against Women Act. Declaring themselves to be “the ultimate expositor of the constitutional text,” they issued a warning shot aimed at Congress’s ability to interpret and enforce the Reconstruction amendments in particular and constitutional law more broadly.

The Court under Chief Justice John Roberts inherited this project and escalated it. What once startled in Lopez and Morrison—the conservative bloc striking down major federal legislation—is now routine. But the Roberts Court, pushed further right by new appointments, has plunged into once-unthinkable territory. Its decisions combine a contempt for negotiated legislative compromise, an insensitivity to the human crises Congress tries to address, and a hostility to multipolar sites of constitutional interpretation.

Few policy domains have escaped unscathed. In the 2010s alone, the Court invalidated core provisions of the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) in an opinion that paid “scant attention to the overarching aim” of Congress to make it “feasible for women to work while sustaining family life,” as Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg noted in dissent. It uprooted Congress’s design of the federal bankruptcy system, inflicting what Justice Stephen Breyer called “needless additional suffering” on vulnerable people. And it tossed an entire federal sports-betting law, unleashing a wave of financial misery.

Even acts framed as judicial modesty mask great hubris. Consider the Affordable Care Act, the most important domestic law since Lyndon B. Johnson’s Great Society. In 2012, Roberts joined the Court’s liberal justices to spare the law from wholesale demolition; the remaining conservatives voted to strike it down in full. Yet the chief justice’s “upholding” opinion declared that Congress lacked authority under its spending power to enact the assiduously constructed Medicaid expansion. In doing so, the Court gutted one of the ACA’s most ambitious components, denying millions of poor Americans in red states inexpensive health-care coverage.

Most dramatically, the Court has deconstructed the Voting Rights Act, the crown jewel of the civil-rights movement. In Shelby County v. Holder (2013), it demolished the act’s preclearance regime, an effective statutory provision that blocked racially discriminatory election rules before they went into effect. The Court’s evisceration led more voting-rights cases to be brought under another part of the VRA, which the Court then proceeded to undermine in Brnovich v. DNC (2021). A further gutting of the VRA is now likely in a case the Court will hand down this term.

Meanwhile, a constellation of campaign-finance decisions—Citizens United (2010), McCutcheon (2014), and others less well known—dismantled Congress’s two most significant efforts to regulate private money in public elections, eroding the safeguards that protect elections as conduits of public opinion. Here, again, the Court could go further this term, in a case brought by Republicans seeking to lift limits on how much parties may spend in coordination with candidates.

It is a category error to treat these decisions as isolated strikes against discrete statutes. The laws in question reflect something more profound: Congress mediating public constitutional values, drawing on sustained exchange with the people, and articulating constitutional meaning through debate and enactment. In short, they are instances of congressional constitutionalism. By overriding these laws, the Court rejects this rival interpreter’s long-recognized authority to give form to the nation’s evolving and elusive constitutional aspirations in law.

The FMLA was never merely a routine tax-and-spend measure. Its sponsors explicitly advanced a vision of gender equality under the Fourteenth Amendment, one emerging from their constituents and more expansive than the Court’s. Campaign-finance laws likewise do more than regulate money in politics; they embody congressional judgments about the conditions necessary for democratic self-government and meaningful political opportunity. And the VRA—described by legal scholars as a “super-statute”—marks the high point of this tradition: not an ordinary exercise in budgeting, but Congress giving constitutional form to the country’s deepest democratic commitments.

Congress’s constitutionalism carries advantages over the Court’s. Most important, it remains tethered to the public. Elections, however imperfectly, compel lawmakers to listen and respond. When Congress speaks on constitutional affairs, this democratic legitimacy wields an authority that the Court’s rarefied exegesis cannot match. Congress also possesses institutional tools that the Court lacks. Statutes can be comprehensive and prospective; their language can be iterative, granular, and versatile. The FMLA, VRA, and ACA exist because legislators navigated tangled terrain—negotiating, compromising, calibrating demands among plural interests in and outside of the Capitol. Cloistered justices cannot do these things. They adjudicate from a comparatively passive posture, bereft of an enforcement and policy-making apparatus.

The Roberts Court has hollowed out these dynamic sources of congressional constitutionalism. Its voting-rights and campaign-finance decisions have weakened the electoral systems that make Congress responsive to the public. Statutes of this genre, to borrow from the former Yale Law School dean Robert Post, should be thought of as “wholesome legislation that nourishes democratic legitimacy”—measured legislative judgments about the guardrails and ground rules necessary to preserve elections as channels of representation, and public faith in them as such. In dismantling this scaffolding, the Court has left Congress more detached from its electorate, diminishing its claim and role as a representative authority.

The Court has further eroded the conditions that make lawmaking possible. Deregulated campaign finance has produced a political economy in which lawmakers and candidates spend much of their day fundraising. Time that might otherwise be devoted to legislation, oversight, or the slow, unpredictable social interactions that foster bipartisanship is instead siphoned off to “call time” and cocktail hour. Empirical studies confirm that reliance on large donors depresses participation in time-intensive legislative activities—things such as bill sponsorship, floor debate, and committee work. It simultaneously redirects lawmakers’ attention toward courting high-net-worth donors and away from talking to people in their districts.

And then there is gerrymandering. By immunizing partisan-drawn maps from federal-court scrutiny, the Court’s decision in Rucho v. Common Cause (2019) entrenched electoral distortion in American politics. The Court has since doubled down. Last month, Justice Samuel Alito defended Texas’s gerrymandered maps on the grounds that they reflected “partisan advantage pure and simple”—an unabashed apologia for a practice destructive to democracy. Gerrymandering for partisan advantage begets safe seats. Safe seats reward ideologues, marginalize moderate voices, and intensify polarization. They elevate representatives who are less responsive to median voters and less inclined to legislative compromise. Representation thins and drifts toward the extremes, and public confidence in Congress as an accountable institution erodes along with it.

The Court’s expansion of its power vis-à-vis Congress has proceeded on two mutually reinforcing fronts. Methodologically, it has transformed how the Court interprets law.  Substantively, it has redefined what the Constitution forbids, preemptively removing entire policy domains from democratic deliberation before voters and lawmakers can even weigh in.

The Court now rigidly reads legal texts through originalism and textualism, both of which concentrate power in the judiciary, and especially in the Supreme Court. Originalism empowers judges to parse contemporary laws through their own analysis of an “original understanding” of the Constitution’s provisions at the time of adoption. Textualism—which emphasizes the words of a statute themselves to divine an analogous (and equally chimerical) “ordinary meaning”—treats Congress with overt disdain, disregarding lawmakers’ intentions, factual findings, and the problems they sought to address.

As part of this textualist counterrevolution, the Court has invented new rules and discarded old ones to second-guess legislative choices. The so-called major-questions doctrine, announced from whole cloth in West Virginia v. EPA (2022), lets judges strike down agency actions based on their own subjective calls about which legal questions involve “vast economic and political significance.” More recently, the overturning of Chevron deference in Loper Bright (2024) gives judges new bases to substitute their preferred interpretations for those of expert agencies acting on congressional will.

The Court has also interpreted certain constitutional rights so broadly as to strip Congress—and, crucially, the people who act through it to advance their constitutional visions—of the power to address pressing social problems. For example, its expansive, libertarian reading of the First Amendment, which it has used to knock down labor-organizing protections and public-accommodation laws, doesn’t just embrace a dubious account of what speech is; it forecloses forms of regulation and redistribution historically left to the democratic arena. And its Second Amendment jurisprudence now blocks some of the most effective legislative interventions to combat gun violence.

The power grab extends to the mechanics of lawmaking itself. For decades, the Court allowed Congress to design statutes with flexibility, including by creating independent agencies to handle complex issues requiring expertise. The Roberts Court is unraveling that discretion, discovering fatal constitutional problems in arrangements that had stood for generations. Trump v. Slaughter, argued last month, is poised to join a long line of cases, including Free Enterprise Fund v. Public Accounting Oversight Board (2010) and Seila Law v. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (2020), in which the Court has invalidated congressionally created independent agencies. This project shrinks the space for legislative creativity in confronting and solving problems.

Finally, the Court has constrained Congress’s authority to define rights and check executive power. TransUnion v. Ramirez (2021), for instance, curtailed Congress’s ability to create enforceable legal rights—a core legislative function—when it limited consumers’ ability to sue over inaccurate reporting of financial information. Trump v. United States (2024) radically expanded presidential immunity, further limiting Congress’s capacity in another core function: overseeing and constraining the executive.

For now, the supernova of Donald Trump’s presidency has muted this systemic conflict in public view. His second term—defined by galloping abuses of executive power buttressed by Trump v. United States—has played out against a Republican Congress and Republican Court aligned, if not enthralled, with him. But this alignment is likely temporary and contingent. Should a Democratic Congress return, the conflict will roar back into view.

Paul Rosenzweig: The Supreme Court’s inconsistency is very revealing

The short-term convergence of the branches should not obscure the larger transformation: Congress is no longer the first branch of government. The same gale-force winds of polarization that split Congress into warring camps has also produced a Republican-appointee-dominated Court systematically constraining congressional power while expanding its own.

The Court alone is not responsible for all causes of Congress’s decline. Partisan polarization predates the Roberts Court and has deep structural roots in geographic sorting, media fragmentation, and the fusion of personal identity with politics. The distorting design of the Senate and the Electoral College, the filibuster’s persistence, and centralized leadership have all contributed to legislative ossification. But the Court has made things worse. Its hard-right jurisprudence is an outgrowth of polarization and an accelerant of dysfunction.

A constitutional democracy cannot survive on judicial pronouncements alone. It requires institutions capable of translating popular commitments into lasting legal forms through deliberation and compromise. In other words, it needs a functioning Congress.

This capacity to translate democratic and constitutional aspirations matters not because legislative majorities are always right, but because certain national challenges cannot be deferred or ignored indefinitely, and because judicial supremacy cannot substitute for self-governance. When the Court claims exclusive authority over constitutional meaning while systematically weakening the federal institution most responsive to the people, it does not preserve the constitutional order. It ends it.</div>

You still have to wear a fancy helmet. True the new one is higher resolution and more immersive but it is still a helmet. When these things are as small as sunglasses or integrated into contact lenses it will make more sense.

When fanboys were telling me that all cars would be self-driving by 2020.

This accelerates the timeline to FSD versus the path they were on. They&#39;re going to have better self-driving, just not using the Drive Pilot system. They couldn&#39;t do eyes off in street level driving so easily as on highways. The highway driving experience should be  similar. They are implementing &quot;Level 2++&quot; ... &quot;Drive Pilot Assist&quot;, that brings in street driving not just highways .. and in within a couple of years they will skip level 3 and go directly to level 4.

Nobody outside of Arkham Asylum for the criminally insane said in 2018 that all cars will be FSD by 2020. We already have FSD, ride a Waymo and see for yourself. People misjudged to the time it will take to solve and distribute full self driving. They didn&#39;t misjudge that it could be solved.

Even Tesla, which has the cheapest and fewest sensors possible is almost fully level 4 FSD capable.

> Nobody outside of Arkham Asylum for the criminally insane said in 2018 that all cars will be FSD by 2020.

Fanboys in car forums did. I particularly remembered it because it was so absurd.

Is this another of those &quot;even though you were there and saw it, that definitely couldn&#39;t have happened&quot; things?

They cited both middling demand and development costs as reasons for killing it.

The problem with Level 3 self-driving is that it&#39;s mostly useless. It can&#39;t control the car in all conditions. It may require the vehicle to navigate to safety and/or return control to the driver. Hardly anyone really wants that. It&#39;s not ubiquitous and reliable. You can&#39;t plan around it.

People really want Level 4, which is fully autonomous driving at human-equivalent levels in all conditions. But that&#39;s a much harder problem to solve.

Meanwhile, you&#39;re dealing with the potential liability from Level 3 self-drive without a huge increase in sales to justify it. This is a classic risk-vs-reward calculation.

I expect Mercedes-Benz to continue working toward Level 4 self-drive, but, personally, I&#39;ve never seen the point of Level 3. I certainly wouldn&#39;t pay for it, and apparently I&#39;m not alone in that respect.

too many unexplained unintended acceleration events, check out some mbeq boards.

Anything short of being able to drive me anywhere with full autonomy is more or less useless to me. If I have to pay attention at any point during the drive I might as well just drive myself and save the money for the service.

The benefits of autonomous driving only really come from level 4 or 5. If I can summon my car from across town or sleep in the back during a road trip, that provides real benefits to me as the owner. But sitting in the driver&#39;s seat staring at the road while waiting to take over at a moment&#39;s notice does nothing for me. If I have to be ready to take over, I&#39;d prefer to just drive myself.

They got a big piece of the 700-MHz band, and in exchange they had to agree to stop being assholes for a while.

So, now do they have to give that bandwidth slice back?

If allocations were based on the level of ass-hattery, they&#39;d be left with one CB channel.

So, now do they have to give that bandwidth slice back?No, because this is a waiver (not a cancellation of the original agreement).  While it seems that the waiver will be superseded by new rules about unlocking (hint: those new rules are not likely to be especially consumer friendly), it is still possible for some future commission to undo the waiver.

as long as the checks clear the waiver flies.

While I don&#39;t like the whole idea of &quot;locked&quot; phones in the first place, it was ridiculous that Verizon was explicitly singled-out in the regulations.
Well, not really.  Verizon agreed to the quick unlocking as part of their 2007 700MHz spectrum acquisition (and they really wanted that spectrum).

I don&#39;t see why people who live there should have to pay more so people on the other side of the world can generate Emma Watson pr0n.

Local industry actually produces something useful and provides jobs for the people who live there.

AI data centres provide very few jobs and are designed to eliminate jobs all over the world while also making Emma Watson pr0n.

It&#39;s the most absurd misallocation of resources I&#39;ve ever seen in my life.

back in my day it was Natalie Portman, naked and petrified, covered in hot grits.

Anything that uses over a certain percentage of power for said plant should be directly charged for infrastructure upgrades required to deliver it.

Telecoms do that already - you want a special fiber line, shoot you want a connection to an area that isnâ(TM)t yet served - you pay up front for that connection. Iâ(TM)ve seen Comcast charge $10k to extend their service to a new neighborhood.

There will come a time that you, the consumer, will not get any power from the grid, no matter how much you want to pay. Energy-security, that will be the result of AI in datacenters in their current form.

AI, in its current form, deserves to die in the biggest bubble implosion man ever knew or should want to know. AI, as a technology can be a boon for consumers. Its current form sure isn&#39;t it.

But it won&#39;t be an electricity problem alone. Datacenters tend to consume a lot of water too for cooling. And once t

I don&#39;t understand why heavy users aren&#39;t charged more, like water.  In my town water usage is tiered, and those upper tiers charge you a lot more per gallon than if you conserve.  C&#39;mon, electric company, do the same, and make those upper tiers juicy and you can finance yourself into great infrastructure upgrades (think power lines in forests that for some reason catch fire frequently).  Those AI companies are flush with inventory money, they can afford it, fleece the fuck of them for taking our electricity to do their stupid AI shit.

It depends on where you are, from a resource cost (fuel cost) point of view. Out here in the Pacific Northwest, our &quot;fuel cost&quot; is nearly zero. Because it&#39;s primarily hydroelectric. What is expensive is the capital cost of the grid infrastructure but needed to serve each customer&#39;s peak demand. But politicaly, it was advanageous to &quot;convert&quot; those charges to an equvalent energy consumption fee. Dollars per kilowatt-hour. In order to prevent a tragedy of the commons. &quot;I&quot;&#39;ve paid my fee for peak use this mont

If takes half of power plant&#39;s output to drive a datacenter, then they can damn well pay for the plant.

Don&#39;t let them connect to the grid until they do. Or, require that they be able to generate most of their power locally, either onsite or at a nearby site.

These are billion-dollar investments. Make them buy or build their facilities in way that doesn&#39;t affect the state/county/local population.

If you possibly can. It&#39;s THE way to address peak demand problems and, with battery storage, a solution to continuity.

My thoughts exactly. Like, good by why is it a news? Dozens of companies quietly keep employees on payroll contributing OS projects.

If they gave 100M one time, maybe it would have been newsworthy. 1.5m is nothing

> Big company uses open source and doesn&#39;t pay a cent. People are upset> Big company uses open source and pays $1.5 million. People are upset

Nobody is upset they paid $1.5M, at least, not here so far.

Nobody should be impressed they paid $1.5M. It&#39;s not a lot of money any more and it&#39;s jack shit to them. Am I mad? No. Do I think they should not have done it? Also no. Am I amazed by their munificence? No again.

Can the foundation use it? Yes.Not long ago they had to decline government money because of attached &quot;anti woke&quot; clauses. Now they get some money no strings attached.

Maybe that is all Python asked for to cover headcount for those two package improvements.We don&#39;t need one company paying for everything we need each company to pay their share.

Scott was a unifier for all of those who slogged it out in the office.

Until he showed his true spirit with his racist tirade calling black people a &quot;hate group&quot; [bbc.com] and essentially declaring himself pro-segregationist which got his comic strip cancelled in hundreds of newspapers.

Turns out he was just a racist shitbag at the end.

Devisive. D i visive. Its root word is &quot;divide&quot;.

My accent trips up my spelling if I am not very meticulous, especially when I casually post to a forum of nearly a dozen regular readers.

The real question is was he always a asshole or did he become oneAre assholes born or made...great discussion question...I read Dilbert and several of the management books that he wrote that were interspersed with comics...all in the trashcan now as I can&#39;t support someone who shamelessly espoused racist views.  In terms of born or made, for most people I think they are made into assholes. I don&#39;t know him personally and certainly didn&#39;t know him before he became famous, but I have little doubt that getting fabulously rich isolates you from the real world and distorts your view of others in dangerous ways. I see it in my own life, too. I&#39;m not wealthy by Scot Adam&#39;s standards, but certainly above the median in my community, and I know that the resources and access I have because of that money isolates me and changes my perspective on others&#39; challenges and life experiences, and warps my view on how most people in the world live; and I&#39;m not even in the same stratosphere as Adams&#39; wealth.  Over the holidays my parents bought some new furniture, and donated some furniture to a refugee family. They were forced out of their country (Sudan) by war. And live in a tiny, falling-down shack in a terrible, dangerous, dirty part of town. And they have nothing. Six kids, four adults. And they were happy to have the used furniture.  The wealthier you get the harder you have to work to recognize how your wealth blinds you from the experience of most people in the world and how it distorts your views on how most people in the world live. It takes intentionality and humbleness, both of which it seems Adams had in short supply.

a social media bubble before social media became a &#39;thing&#39;.

he started a blog and the comments started to taint things - feeding his ego by praising how much he knows about office life and then convincing him that he&#39;s therefore an expert at everything...and then when others challenged some of his claims or &#39;questions&#39; (of the &quot;just asking&quot; type), he doubled-down because the applause from the right-wingers on his feed was louder. We respond to positive reinforcement until we&#39;re aware of it, and he (like others we could name) never really became aware of it, never became aware of the biases building and hardening. he treated the questions as an attack on him (like others we could name)

And then the &#39;all conservative positions are the same conservative positions&#39; started kicking in. Having decided he&#39;s &quot;right&quot; in agreeing with some things, he falls into agreeing with almost all of them.

His vaccine denialism was the last straw for me, but if I&#39;d known about his holocaust denialism sooner, I&#39;d have quit dilbert-reading back then. somehow that had missed my circles at the time.

I don&#39;t want to go all the way to &quot;right wing politics is a mental disease&quot; but we&#39;re sure stacking up a lot of correlating evidence to support that conclusion these days the farther right you go...

Being a victim of your own ignorance and stupidity is valid.  See: Steve Jobs and treating his aggressive pancreatic cancer with fruit.

There&#39;s a key difference: in your scenario it&#39;s the guy speaking ill of the dead (Trump) who was saying batshit crazy stuff.

Here, we&#39;re talking about the batshit crazy stuff the dead guy himself said.  Either way, speaking ill of the dead right after their passing is disrespectful... but again, there&#39;s a major difference between the dead guy saying crazy shit pre-death and our President saying crazy shit after.

I&#39;d also point out that there&#39;s a major difference between saying crazy shit because you&#39;re so mentally ill you&#39;re about to be committed, and an otherwise sane person saying crazy shit with no (major) mental illness.

The former literally cannot know they are saying crazy shit, because they are crazy, while the latter (Trump and Adams) say crazy shit despite being sane enough to function in society (ie. sane enough to know better).

background: I have attended a few DSA BBQs, so I know more than one Democratic Socialists. I&#39;m not really aligned with them politically, but they seem more left than the democrats that are frequently accused of being &quot;far left radicals&quot; or whatever.I don&#39;t know if people are just being hyperbolic or if they actually have no sense of left versus right dichotomy.In short, politics has gotten both weirder and stupider. Not sure if we should all check out or have a revolution. Neither option is likely going to

Better that you don&#39;t know. Seeing your heroes behave like a small minded deplorables is not a great feeling.

Pointy-headed man (PHM) was my bosses boss back when I read those cartoons.  My immediate boss was an alcoholic who had been promoted because he had organised a company party, and because he could not become dangerous to PHM by displaying excessive competence (rather short sighted, the alcoholic later attacked someone at another company party while his BAC was more of an ABC).

Agreed.   His strips were one of a handful that I looked forward to reading each day  (...back in the day)

Remembered for hitting the bullseye on corporate bullshit, as well as being remembered for espousing racist, segregationist views and getting himself de-published by anyone with a printing press that matters.

After diagnosis ended up doing a bunch of crankpot treatments, literally was taking Ivermectin [npr.org] (meanwhile Biden recently rang the bell on his treatment) to try and treat his cancer and when it was too late tried to beg Trump to let him cut the line for experimental treatments [npr.org] which would have put him in front of people who were doing the proper thing and listening to doctors.

Pretty bleak and still sad because as someone who grew up in the 90&#39;s Dilbert was important.  Could have taken the Bill Watterson path and went out a legend. RIP.

I read his Twitter now and again, and while I may have misinterpreted him I don&#39;t believe that&#39;s even remotely true. I remember him saying he tried Ivermectin and it made no difference, but it seemed to be a &#39;what do I have to lose?&#39; thing rather than an alternative to regular cancer treatment.

Sorry to hear about your wife.  My wife had breast cancer but doctors caught it early.  She just had surgery and radiation, and so far has been clear for five years.

I&#39;m sorry for what you and your wife are going through. Cancer is a terrible disease. I wish the two of you all the best. I hope she experiences one of those spontaneous remissions and ends up living long after.

The mockery is (hopefully) aimed at the quacks who try to profit off the desperation of people with no other options and not those who are deceived by them.

So a doctor told him to try an anti-parasitic for prostate cancer? No, this is the type of thing you do when you are far too lost in the sauce of your own conspiracies and when you&#39;ve spent the better part of half a decade sowing doubt about medicine, saying vaccines are  it&#39;s a bit fitting.

&quot;Antivaxxers were right, i got jabbed and I regret it&quot; - Scott Adams

Still sad but saying that in 2025 is a RIP Bozo [knowyourmeme.com] moment.

Obviously he&#39;ll be missed for his comics.  A lot of people won&#39;t miss him for his politics.

My childhood introduction to stand-up comedy was Bill Cosby records my parents had so I can sympathize with the idea of &quot;separate art from the artist.&quot;

When you&#39;re dying, you&#39;ll grasp at anything.

You do know it is medically unethical (and i think also illegal) to give people placebos to actually sick people you know.

For cancer they test against the established treatment (not against placebo alone).

For example published today: &quot;randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 3 study of Socazolimab or placebo&quot; for lung cancer. The &quot;Socazolimab or placebo&quot; part is an additional pill on top of the established treatment. All the patients got the chemo. (The conclusion is the drug prolonged the patient life by 1.2 month.) https://www.nature.com/article...  [nature.com]

No, in fact they will not give a person who could die something the doctors know will not work.

The problem is that Ivermectin isn&#39;t a placebo. It&#39;s a real drug with real side effects [mayoclinic.org] and that puts a real load on your body when you take it. People who say &quot;it can&#39;t hurt&quot; are forgetting that anything that effects your body is diverting resources from other metabolic processes, like the immune response to cancer. There&#39;s a reason that double blind studies are a thing, not only to see if a drug does better than placebo, but also to see if it does worse.

This.I didn&#39;t follow too closely but from what I saw he did all the normal stuff and, as it often happens with cancer... doctors at one point say, it&#39;s not going to well.  and later sorry that&#39;s all we got.

nothing wrong with trying whatever ancillary method and hail Mary you can.

not directly related but https://xkcd.com/931/ [xkcd.com]  (about the probabilistic nature of it.  he was in one of the earlier off ramps)

Again, if he was just some guy or he was just Scott Adams the artist still and not a huge political commentator I wouldn&#39;t care, go for it.

However, this is a guy who used his large platform to push things like RFK into the HHS role.  Other people have likely been affected or even died because of that.

Yes and I would reserve such respect for people who don&#39;t have large platforms and use them to sow doubt about medical science.

I came to post that Biden article, but you beat me to the punch.  I don&#39;t blame the guy for pulling strings when he was dying.  His politics are pretty disgusting though.  Still, a horrible way to go.

I wouldn&#39;t either for any normal person but someone with his huge following and he basically sowed doubt in the entire field of medical science for 5+ years means he gets very little sympathy from me.

I hope the fossils in the Senate understand the RFK Jr. nomination is not politics as usual. It&#39;s not politics of any kind. It&#39;s life and death for American families.

If you take this opportunity away from us -- ALL of us -- we&#39;re going to take it personally. Read the room.

Yeah that&#39;s my opinion and point; if you supported RFK for HHS then you played a part in creating more human suffering and death.

Who said anything to the contrary? This is complete bad faith and unserious conspiracy brain shit.

Nobody has doubted how great Ivermectin is for parasites. You have zero evidence it does anything for covid or cancer.  We should discourage people from trying &quot;long shots&quot; with no evidence and particularly notable figures with large followings who publicize those steps. This isn&#39;t a long shot, it&#39;s a zero shot, it;s a shot into your own skull.

Do people really don&#39;t think researchers don&#39;t try things like this?  After that bullshit artist Pierre Kory had his bullshit papers we spent thousands of man hours and millions of dollars looking into HCQ and ivermectin for covid.  It didn&#39;t work!

A large study finds that ivermectin does not reduce risk of Covid-19 hospitalization. [nih.gov]

Effect of Early Treatment with Ivermectin among Patients with Covid-19  [nih.gov]

Treatment with ivermectin did not result in a lower incidence of medical admission to a hospital due to progression of Covid-19 or of prolonged emergency department observation among outpatients with an early diagnosis of Covid-19.

In this meta-analysis, the use of ivermectin was not associa

Bro, when you need to read between the lines so much you&#39;ve gone cross eyed just to bad faith my statement it might mean you are in the wrong here.

We&#39;re presumably both humans with language skills here.  Do you really think I am saying ivermecting is somehow unsafe or that it&#39;s unproven for the things being discussed here.

I get some pedantry but this is a bit too much.

You can overdose anything. Ivermectin works on COVID if you overdose it in the same way a headshot works on COVID.

The poetic justice of opposing Biden who gave cancer research a massive boost and supporting Dementia Don who undermined and now is gutting all medical research... and who has zero empathy (and at times appears to view it as a flaw) to ask for a special exception without a massive BRIBE also is an example of cognitive dissonance.

Dude spent his last years trying to cause pain and suffering in other people. What a waste of a life.

Yep. 

I&#39;ll never  understand this American obsession with trying to redeem people after they are dead. Sadly, Scott&#39;s legacy is and will always be his Trump endorsements and what he said and did in the last few years of his life, not the funny cartoon I and millions of others used to enjoy.

His legacy won&#39;t be Dilbert? It&#39;ll be his political opinions? That about sums up my thoughts. I waded into his blog a long while ago, and realized him and I will never see eye to eye politically. Whatever. Dude&#39;s entitled to his opinions. After Dilbert was pulled from syndication, and he started charging to view his website, I quit reading Dilbert daily.  Fast forward a year or two, I honestly had to be reminded exactly what his batshit opinions were as of late. I will never forget that he&#39;s the one who gave us Dilbert. I suspect as history fades nobody will remember

And he was right that Trump managed to communicate in a way that got him elected.

It does seem like it was too soon for him.  Fortunately the controversy surrounding his removal from comic archives was long enough ago that maybe there won&#39;t be too many people spitting on his grave.

Sadly his old comics are still largely banished from free online comic archives. Or at least they were last time I checked.

On a related note, the cynical side of me realizes that Adams probably wanted to leave print publication behind which is why he was more than happy to move to a subscription site. His &quot;canc

During his &quot;Real Coffee with Scott Adams&quot; YouTube show, Adams was discussing a controversial Rasmussen poll that asked people if they agreed with the statement, &quot;It&#39;s okay to be white&quot;. Among Black respondents in the poll, 26% said they disagreed with the statement and 21% were unsure, meaning nearly half did not agree it was okay to be white.

In response to these figures, Adams stated:

&quot;If nearly half of all Blacks are not OK with white people ... that&#39;s a hate group&quot;.

&quot;If nearly half of all Blacks are not OK with white people ... that&#39;s a hate group&quot;.Possibly a misunderstanding of the question. If you ask black individuals if it is OK to be white, I&#39;d expect a high negative response. Perhaps they thought the statement was tageted at them personally. Of course, it&#39;s not OK for them to be white. They are black. And many take pride in that identity.
Now if you asked if it was OK for white people to make such a statement about themselves, I wouldn&#39;t expect a high negative response.

Now if you asked if it was OK for white people to make such a statement about themselves, I wouldn&#39;t expect a high negative response.

I would personally go for &quot;unsure&quot;, not because I&#39;m personally unsure whether it&#39;s &quot;ok to be white&quot;, but because the motivations behind the question are unclear, and I can guess only guess it&#39;s going to be used to enable haters to hate, such as making up imaginary hate groups. A serious study on whether people feel okay with their skin tones, or whether people have positive opinion of other people with certain skin tones, would be much more careful in crafting questions.

Glad he got more time with his family than anyone thought he&#39;d have, and kept his faculties until the end.  May we all be so lucky.

But did he really?  He moved towards insanity in his final decade but it didn&#39;t look like it was a linear decline.

As a public figure, he was a cheap, petty piece of shit, taking great joy in punching down. It seems like empathy was a pathway to sadism for him.

Scott seemed great until he went full racist and full MAGA. Rather than seeking medically established treatment for his cancer, he tried to treat it with ivermectin. He went full MAGA and it ultimately killed him.

They&#39;re posted elsewhere in the comments. He took ivermectin and when that didn&#39;t work, he asked Trump to let him skip the line for an experimental cancer treatment. Dilbert got pulled from syndication across most of the US because of his racist comments on his podcast.

Literally no evidence for what you said. In fact, he publicly asked Trump to be allowed to take an experimental prostate medication, which shows that not only was he taking accepted medicine he was also volunteering himself to be tested on the most cutting edge treatments.

People seem to think that facts are something you can change with sophistry and rhetorical hackery. Maybe instead of confidently stating things you don&#39;t know are true, you do your best to find out what the facts are and try to make the w

The dude went full pro-Trump and even wrote a book about it. He pushed completely unfounded claims about ivermectin and other baseless &quot;cures&quot; that are pushed by MAGA. He&#39;s dead due to his own choices, including his choice to ignore medical science.

Fact is, he had the same cancer that Biden had. Biden is now cancer free because he followed the treatment of legitimate doctors. Adams is now dead because he believed he was smarter than doctors and promoted things that aren&#39;t even legal to prescribe to humans.

Remember there&#39;s no such thing as a small act of kindness. Every act creates a ripple effectwith no logical end.

&quot;Things did not go well for me ... my body fell before my brain.&quot;That is definitely debateable.

Dilbert never failed to crack me up. Thanks for the laughs. RIP Scott.

I always figured his &quot;racist rant&quot; was strategic to get out of syndicate contracts. He was able to take Dilbert to a subscription model and while I didn&#39;t subscribe, it was clear from samples I saw that he had edgier things to say than public syndicates would allow.

Every artist lost is a loss to our collective culture. I&#39;ll miss his thoughts that were generally insightful even when I found them disagreeable.

I visited a fair number of software groups in tech and defense companies.  The &#39;Dilbert Metric&#39; where you could tell the health of an organization by the number of comic strips on cubicle walls correlated quite well with my observations.  Too few (and &#39;zero&#39; was a really bad sign) showed oppressive management and thoroughly demotivated and cowed staff.  Too many was an indication of clueless management and staff that didn&#39;t really know what they were trying to accomplish.  &quot;Just enough&quot; seemed to be an average of 3-5 strips/cubicle.

Rest in peace, and my condolences to his family.

Nah fuck all that nonsense.  He was a piece of shit and I wish he had died much sooner.

You BELIEVE somehow people deserve respect upon death. Some don&#39;t believe what you do.

The dead can&#39;t get the hate they earned.  In some cases, but more common in the USA, the haters do not know right from wrong so it reflects more upon them.

It was the most unlikely response to the widely expected overturning of Roe v. Wade. In the summer of 2021, a small group of about 12 individuals, including some health care workers, elected officials, and local community activists, in the deep-red state of Wyoming—which didn’t have a single abortion clinic at the time—began planning to open a new clinic in the college town of Casper. This was at the same time that most abortion clinics in red states, seeing the writing on the wall, had begun planning to close or move to a more hospitable location. But not in Wyoming.

And this long-shot gamble paid off. Wellspring Health Access, which provides abortions as well as other services including family planning, general gynecology, and gender affirming care, opened its doors in spring 2023, almost a year after the Supreme Court decided Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization. Since then, the clinic has faced unending legal challenges from the state. However, at each turn, the clinic has prevailed, culminating in a big win before the Wyoming Supreme Court last week. This ruling, which may have significance for abortion rights beyond Wyoming, struck down the state’s general abortion ban as well as a specific ban on mifepristone, one of the two drugs used in a medication abortion.

How did this implausible turn of events come to pass? Beyond the determination of the community group in Casper, two main factors explain the ultimate success of this venture: Wyoming’s unique libertarian constitution and the savvy and determination of a woman named Julie Burkhart. In a wonderful instance of karma, the famously libertarian citizens of Wyoming, enraged by the passage of the Affordable Care Act, aka “Obamacare,” in 2010, amended their constitution, stipulating that individuals have the right to make their own health care decisions. This amendment became the heart of the legal strategy used by the would-be clinic’s lawyers, and this argument ultimately prevailed.

But there needed to be someone to use that constitutional provision, and that’s where Julie Burkhart came in. Julie is a longtime, well-known figure in abortion-providing circles. She is not a clinician, but rather an abortion access strategist and a skillful clinic operator who has a track record of opening abortion facilities in hostile and underserved areas. It was this reputation that led the Casper group to invite her to work with them even when Roe was about to be overturned.

Julie’s involvement with abortion care began in 2001, when she began work with Dr. George Tiller, the Kansas doctor who was assassinated in 2009 in his church by an anti-abortion fanatic. Tiller’s mentorship was deeply influential for Julie, and she has worked in the abortion field since his death. She purchased his Wichita clinic from his widow and reestablished abortion there, a city that had been left without such care after Tiller’s death. She also went on to open a clinic in Oklahoma, as well as several other places.

As part of a book project on how people in various sectors of the abortion-providing community were preparing for and then responding to the Dobbs, we interviewed Julie three times over the course of 2022. These interviews took place at the very beginning of that year, immediately after the decision was announced in June, and finally at the end of 2022.

Our first interview with Julie, in January 2022, took place while she and her Casper allies were already actively planning how to move forward with an abortion clinic. A lucky break occurred, she told us, when a wealthy donor purchased a facility from a medical practice that had closed and donated it to the group. This purchase was especially fortuitous as the facility was in an area already zoned to permit a medical clinic.

Finding a contractor to upgrade the clinic for abortion services was a challenge, though. Abortion providers have long faced difficulties finding people willing to work with them. Even if the individual workers involved are not opposed to abortion, they often have realistic fears of being targeted by anti-abortion forces and being subjected to boycotts. Julie did manage to convince a local contractor to do the necessary work, vaguely telling him the clinic was for a “women’s health center.” The contractor did eventually learn the intended purpose of the facility, but continued to do the work, and tellingly, did not post a sign on the site giving the name of his company, as is normally done.

Julie’s fervent hope was to open the clinic about a month before Dobbs was expected to be announced, on the theory that since the clinic would offer a range of services, it could not be shut down, even if providing abortions was no longer legal in the state. As she put it, “So if something does happen in Wyoming, we will have that presence. We will have community ties. We will have standing if we have to go to court.”

But this hope of a pre-Dobbs opening was dashed in May 2022 when Julie awoke to a phone call informing her that the nearly finished clinic had been firebombed. Upon going to the clinic, she learned that most of the building would need to be gutted and rebuilt. The arsonist was eventually caught, but this set the clinic’s opening back by almost a year.

The summer of 2022 got even worse weeks later with the announcement of the Dobbs decision. When we spoke to her shortly after the Supreme Court ruling, Julie was predictably devastated. “I was so angry, so hurt,” she said. Julie spent the day after the decision listening to music at very high volume—including old feminist anthems from the 1970s. But neither the firebombing, the Dobbs decision, nor the Wyoming Legislature’s vote to ban abortion, if the Supreme Court allowed it to do so, broke her and caused her to retreat. As she said to us with more passion in her voice than in previous conversations, “I want to tell you, in Wyoming, we are going to litigate; we are going to fight this thing to the end.”

Finding legal representation proved yet another challenge. Several national legal groups who represented abortion clinics, while very supportive of the idea of a new clinic in Wyoming, were reluctant to get involved, feeling that the aspiration was unrealistic and that their limited resources in the face of a hostile U.S. Supreme Court were better spent elsewhere. But Julie and her comrades finally located local lawyers willing to represent them. Together, they promptly seized the above-mentioned constitutional amendment as their core legal argument.

This strategy quickly paid off. Several lower court victories allowed the clinic to open in 2023, when it began serving not only people in Wyoming but also those from surrounding states which have banned abortion. Julie has since told us there has been both community support and opposition to the clinic. Tellingly in this era of anti-trans sentiment, in some instances, the hostility is as much about the clinic’s provision of gender-affirming care as about abortion.

With the resounding victory from the Wyoming Supreme Court last week, Julie was celebratory when we emailed with her. However, nothing is “over” when it comes to abortion conflicts, especially in a place like Wyoming. In response to the decision, the state’s governor has called for a ballot measure in the 2026 election to amend the state constitution to ban abortion. These kinds of measures since Dobbs have mostly supported the pro-choice position, even in red states. It is unclear how the vote would go in Wyoming, if indeed it is on the ballot. If the measure is before the voters, it is clear that Julie and the Casper community will be actively helping to defeat it.

It’s perhaps inevitable that there are already several online fundraisers for the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent who shot and killed Renee Good in Minneapolis last week. Conservative social media users often rally to financially defend anyone perceived as a member of their team, regardless of how unpalatable their actions might be. One GoFundMe for the ICE agent, Jonathan Ross, has already raised more than $439,000, $10,000 of which came from the billionaire hedge fund manager Bill Ackman, who argued that everyone deserves a hearty defense.

But there was one specific fundraiser that betrayed just how careless the right has become in its tribalist impulses. On GiveSendGo, the “Christian” alternative to GoFundMe, the primary fundraising post for Ross is explicitly white supremacist in nature.

GiveSendGo was built as a kind of conservative, faith-based alternative to GoFundMe, and it has crowdfunded small fortunes for plenty of conservative heroes accused of violent or bigoted actions. For example, it hosted a campaign that raised $836,000 for Shiloh Hendrix, the white mother who called a child on a playground the N-word. It is also where Kyle Rittenhouse raised more than $586,000 for his defense after he killed two men in 2020. Many Jan. 6 insurrectionists—even those who assaulted police officers in their efforts to overturn the election—turned to this platform when they wanted help.

But the site’s Ross fundraiser, which has raised more than $171,000, reveals an even darker side of these crowdfunding efforts.

Titled “Stand With Our Brave ICE Hero,” the fundraiser is a legitimate campaign connected to the agent. It has been shared by Jacob Wells, a co-founder of GiveSendGo, who has personally vouched, on social media, that the funds will go to Ross. It was boosted by major conservative accounts, as well as the right-wing news outlet Alpha News, which was the first publication to share video from Ross’ perspective of the Minneapolis encounter.

But skim to the third paragraph of its description of the event, and you’ll see—or would have seen, as the page has since been edited—a rather odd description of the situation: “This didn’t happen in a vacuum—it’s the direct result of anti-American traitors like Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey (who is Jewish) fanning the flames of resistance.”

In case that reference to Frey’s religion isn’t enough, there are other tells about this particular fundraiser’s specific white supremacist leanings. The fundraiser’s URL is www.givesendgo.com/Theyallmustgo. Then there’s the opener, addressing “America First patriots”—a signal, often, to the more white supremacist element of the right. The text also speaks of “illegal aliens … flooding our nation … and threatening our sovereignty” and of efforts to “purge … parasites from our soil,” dehumanizing rhetoric that evokes Great Replacement conspiracy theories.

But we don’t actually need to decipher the language here, because the man who created the account is an avowed white supremacist who has no desire to hide his views. On X, the man—who goes by Tom Hennessey, it’s unclear if that is his real name—defended the killing by asking if Good was a “negrophile” and arguing that “American stormtroopers … should be able to use extraordinary violence on our behalf.” He celebrates whiteness on his account, argues for the protection of “White American bloodlines,” and promotes the idea that Jews ruin white nations by “flooding” them with immigrants.

It’s not clear if he has any direct connection to Ross, but this isn’t his first fundraiser. In November, Hennessey set up a GoFundMe page for a 20-year-old Mississippi State University student who yelled “Fuck the Jews” at Barstool Sports founder Dave Portnoy. (The page said that Jewish complaints about “hate speech” were weaponized to get “the goyim get locked up.”) And in December, Hennessey set up another page, this time for Crystal Wilsey, a woman who repeatedly used the N-word at a Somali American couple and declared herself to be “a racist.” In fact, the ICE agent page was admittedly out of character for Hennessey, as it didn’t involve an explicitly racist incident. But it did establish this as, at minimum, a hobby for him.

The people who donated to this GoFundMe, or those who just expressed interest, such as Megyn Kelly, may not have all read the page or clocked its white supremacist origins. It has since been edited to remove the reference to Frey’s Judaism; it has not been toned down that much overall. But this incident shows the carelessness behind right-wing solidarity. Ross’ supporters, acting on a kind of anti-left impulse, may think they’re helping their movement by supporting patriots. They are also exposing overt hatred at the core of the anti-immigrant movement.

By now, the footage of Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent Jonathan Ross shooting and killing Minneapolis mom of three Renee Nicole Good has been pored over and dissected frame by frame. When Good tried to drive away from her otherwise anemic standoff with ICE, Ross shot her in the face. Good was barred from receiving medical aid for 15 minutes. It’s all pretty grisly, and it’s increasingly mundane. Already this year, the agency has killed two people. Last year, its most fatal year since 2004, it killed 32. That’s one reason it feels as if Ross could get away with this, a murder, entirely without consequence. ICE has always seemed to operate with impunity, even before this particular administration, and the federal probe into Good’s killing is starting to impede the state investigation.

But on Friday night, a new angle emerged—cellphone footage from Ross himself. In it, more realities of the killing are clarified: Good wasn’t antagonizing the agent, and she had turned her wheels not to try to hit him but instead to drive away slowly. Most telling are Ross’ final words, after he shoots Good but before he stops recording. As her van drifts off, Good soon to be dead in the driver’s seat, he mutters, “Fucking bitch,” mostly to himself.

I know, I know: Who gives a shit about mere words when he literally murdered a woman in the street? On camera, in front of witnesses? With the president defending his every move? It’s almost farcical to care. But to call Good a “fucking bitch”—after he already shot her—still tells us plenty about what Donald Trump and his soldiers think about the rest of us. It also shows us plenty about where we’ve come as a society in this decade of MAGA. Trump often speaks about women as disposable. One of the first times the president showed us he plays by a different set of rules was when he bounced back after being caught on a hot mic talking to Billy Bush about how he could “grab [women] by the pussy.”

The snarl of Ross calling Good a “fucking bitch” is familiar in the way any garden-variety misogynistic comment is to most women. He said it after he shot her, after it was clear she would be grievously injured at best and dead at worst. It was adding literal insult to injury, an aside meant mostly for himself, to shore him up as the big man who won the fight with this small girl. It wasn’t enough to just kill her—he had to insult her in a uniquely female way too. Ross could have called her a fucking asshole. A piece of shit. A member of Hamas! There was plenty of incendiary invective for Ross to pull from. He chose to call Good a bitch because it’s what men call us all the time. It was easy, and lazy.

Agents like Ross resent women like Good because they don’t give a shit about his authority. (Her evident queerness wasn’t likely to help either.) She was behaving the way we want our mothers to behave—protective, strong—and the way we need white women to act, getting in between the most vulnerable people in their communities and the forces trying to hurt them. She was punished for it in a few ways.

Good’s final sentences to the ICE agent were telling too: “I’m not mad at you.” On paper, this seems like the exact right way to de-escalate a hostile conversation with a police officer; in reality, it’s that kind of dismissal that likely pissed Ross off so much in the first place. The fear is part of the point for ICE; why else would its members hunt mothers down in front of day cares, taking children out of their arms?

Good refused to give ICE any of her fear, up until the very end. Her plan was to drive away calmly, moving like someone who wasn’t afraid of the big bad wolf trying to scare her on her block. Maybe she would have had a better chance if she had showed him she was afraid; he could have retained some agency over her. But for her to drive away, a smile on her face? That’s something only a fucking bitch would do.

One thing this Trump administration has given us, especially post-COVID, is the unvarnished truth of how mean everything is. The Obama administration deported people en masse too. There have always been murders at the hands of the police. But Trump’s version of law and order is so brazenly cruel, so demonstratively evil, that it at least makes it easier to point at, clearer to define. What Good’s murder clarifies for us, among other brutalities, is that the administration and the army it has deployed have categorized the people who live in this country in tidy boxes. Those boxes are labeled with slurs.

God, how low we’ve sunk. At least when Trump was boasting about grabbing women by the pussy, he was doing it behind closed doors. Back then, he knew he had to eke out a mealymouthed apology for the sake of decorum. Now any pretense of such decorum is gone—the uberrich, like Bill Ackman, are helping fund the next act of a guy who killed a woman in her family van. Is it still locker-room talk if they say it to our faces, gun cocked? Never mind that the political and media figures who publicly mourned Charlie Kirk and denounced his public execution have been largely silent about Good’s death. That hypocrisy is obvious, even if it’s still devastating.

This week, there will continue to be countless attempts to justify what Ross said. Words are not actions. He was afraid she was going to hit him with her van. She should have gotten out of the car. Nothing matters except this: Ross called Good a fucking bitch because it’s what he thinks of her. It’s what guys like Ross think about all of us. It’s just that now guys like Ross, and guys like a president, feel free to say it out loud. What a relief, in a way, to hear it stated so plainly.

In the fall of 2015, a horde of lawyers from across the country descended on Las Vegas and beelined for the Bellagio Resort and Casino. They weren’t in town to hear Britney Spears, immerse themselves in the Strip’s glitz and glamour, or answer the siren call of the blackjack tables. But they did harbor gamblers’ get-rich goals.

The draw: a conference called “Mass Torts Made Perfect,” held in the hotel’s grand ballroom, tucked well behind its famous musical water fountain. It was the nation’s largest gathering of attorneys who represent groups of people injured—or killed—by exposure to products like opioids or asbestos.

Some of the attorneys, the insiders, were already rich beyond imagining. Others, like the Elvis impersonators roaming the streets, were wannabes, eager to tap into the mass tort gold mine.

A mass tort is personal-injury litigation on steroids. It’s not just one fender-bender victim with whiplash out for a few thousand bucks. Nor is it a class action over $3 ATM fees that alerts consumers via junk mail. It’s hundreds, thousands, and sometimes more than 100,000 people suing over life-changing physical harm from asbestos-laced baby powder, from NFL concussions, from pacemakers, hip implants, and other medical products.

Ordinarily, plaintiffs expect to file a lawsuit and have a suit-and-tie lawyer usher them through to trial, where they can tell the jury how corporate wrongdoing wrecked their health. But in mass torts, a panel of seven judges decides which federal judge will handle all federal lawsuits with similar facts. Then injured plaintiffs from Alaska to Maine find their cases shipped off to a single judge somewhere in the United States through a process known as multidistrict litigation. With thousands of cases mushed into a scrum, trials disappear and individuals become numbers on a spreadsheet.

At the center of these mass tort cases are real people seeking justice from large corporations. None of those people was in Las Vegas. This gathering was for their lawyers, who paid $1,495 each to attend. This event was about money and power.

Outside the Bellagio’s grand ballroom, three men registered for the conference. They’d jetted in on separate planes, lest one go down. Nine seasoned “spokesmodels” in electric-blue dresses sashayed around them in the hallway like roving disco balls.

“Come party with us tonight,” the women said, handing out embossed invitations to passing lawyers.

“They can’t do that,” snapped the woman behind the makeshift registration desk. “That’s like free advertising.”

With a snort, the youngest of the three men peeled off $10,000 in cash, slapped it on the desk, and registered the strippers too.

The evening’s party hosts were Vincent Chhabra, his son and front man Michael, and Ron Lasorsa, principals in a company called Alpha Law LLC.

Though Alpha Law was billed as a law firm, Vince, Michael, and Ron weren’t lawyers, and their company was not a law firm in the usual sense. They were entrepreneurs who ran a call center that generated client leads. Their Florida-based business raised the hopes of women who’d been hurt, added their names to a giant database of “clients,” then collaborated with real lawyers willing to pay for the clients’ names—and to fork over 85 percent of their attorneys fees to Alpha Law, their new “co-counsel,” if they settled the cases.

Vincent was a first-generation Indian immigrant and dot-com whiz kid. His early online pill mill had led to prison time, which got extended for running an online puppy scam. Out for a few years, he ventured into call centers that targeted women injured by pelvic mesh, a device intended to stabilize sagging organs and cure incontinence but which left many women in diapers and debilitating pain.

Ron, a New Yorker from Long Island, was Vince’s stocky, tattooed business partner. He’d been a company commander at the Marine Corps School of Infantry, gone bald after two tours of duty in Kuwait, and done a long stint on Wall Street before getting fired, filing for divorce, and discovering mass torts.

Rounding out the trio was Michael, the 20-year-old son Vince had been grooming to take over the business since he was 6. At 6-foot-4 and 200 pounds, Michael was still growing into his lanky frame and taking classes at Ohio State. He looked nothing like his dad; he had light skin and blue eyes and was 6 inches taller.

That night, in one of the Bellagio’s opulent suites, the three celebrated with a lavish house party. Just months before, they had sold the names of 14,000 clients to a Texas law firm for $40 million. Those clients were mostly women injured by pelvic mesh. And despite the sale, the trio had no intention of exiting the business.

Music pulsed as lawyers crammed into the suite to ogle the performing strippers. Some elbowed their way closer, others puffed on cigars or weed, and a chosen few leaned back to enjoy lap dances—plus less stand-up activities. Glasses filled with amber liquor, neat, clinked and sloshed onto the billiard table. Late into the night, the guys draped themselves with barely clad women in a photo booth, memorializing the moment. Remnants of white powder stuck to tabletops and bathroom counters. And mobile IV hydration stations stood ready to serve cocktails of vitamins, amino acids, and anti-nausea meds to take the edge off in the morning.

The music, the women, the open bar, the outfits—Armani meets Miami Vice—gave the soiree a Wolf of Wall Street vibe. The details of that night in 2015 vary depending on whom you ask. Someone photographed prominent attorney partygoers in the act and “basically blackmailed” them into payoffs or future business deals. Whether the women or the Chhabras sprang the honey trap was never clear.

The next day at the pool, which had a golden fountain spouting from the middle, was a scene straight out of Animal House: Polo club lawyers sipped bloody marys and mimosas on one side, and the Alpha Law crew wrestled like bawdy Delta House frat bros on the other.

Led by “Savage,” a tough blonde, nine women clad in acid-blue bikinis and stilettos paraded through the Bellagio’s corridors. Advertising Alpha Law, they coaxed male lawyers to the rowdy poolside cabana.

Mike Papantonio was among the invited conference-goers. Pap, as he liked to be called, presided as master of ceremonies. His law firm had invented “Mass Torts Made Perfect” and ran it as a conference for elite plaintiffs’ attorneys nationwide to rub elbows and strategize, making him the unofficial president of the polo club posse. Even as the upper crust regarded Alpha Law’s members as parasites, some of the elite in pelvic-mesh multidistrict-litigation leadership positions profited handily from their efforts.

Pap was surely not amused by Savage’s party; he’d already gotten an earful about the previous night’s shenanigans. He sent out a reproachful email saying everything and nothing at the same time: “A group of individuals … were involved during the seminar in business practices that we do not condone and will not tolerate.” Above the Law, a clever, classed-up National Enquirer for lawyers, filed it under “Conferences/sex” and mused, “Jesus, why don’t we go to these seminars?”

Ron, Vincent, and Michael, however, were on top of the world, the new fat cats on the rise. All the lights of Las Vegas, from Planet Hollywood to Caesars Palace, lay at their feet.

The Bellagio’s grand ballroom felt much like its casino—ornate, windowless, sour with old cigarette smoke. Mike Papantonio strutted on a raised stage, his own face a hundred times larger than life on the screen behind him. With the gestures, voice, and pomaded hair of a televangelist, he introduced a panel of mostly white men in suits, a few female lawyers defending medical device manufacturers, and two illustrious senior federal judges wrangling big cases.

Oblivious to the evening and poolside shenanigans, I sat about halfway back, embedded in a sea of plaintiffs’ lawyers who routinely earn more on a single mass tort deal than I’d take home in 15 years as a law professor. I’d long made noises about lawyers’ self-dealing—the stuff professors complain about over craft beer. I’d been invited to speak because I’m a national expert on mass torts, but no one really wanted me there. It was the inner circle, a cabal I’d tried to disband for more than a decade. Fighting nerves about my upcoming panel, I saw a text light up my phone. It was my boss, the law school dean. “How’s Vegas?” he asked. “SEAL Team Six on standby.”

I was about to repeat a presentation I had given the previous week at Duke Law School, where I highlighted the astronomical sums awarded to a handful of lawyers chosen to lead mass tort cases by a good-old-boy network. That practice, I argued, enriched everyone except their clients, the regular citizens who suffered the actual harm. My remarks moved an apoplectic plaintiff’s lawyer to point across the room at his opposing counsel, leer in my direction, and ask, “So are you accusing me of colluding with him?”

I never used the word collude. “Just curious about these numbers,” I said.

That lawyer was one of eight attorneys who’d led a massive multidistrict lawsuit against Johnson & Johnson, the maker of Propulsid, an acid-reflux drug popular in the 1990s whose side effects allegedly included deadly cardiac abnormalities. I’d unearthed plenty about the business side of this famous case that they’d all have preferred to keep buried.

Lawyers claimed that the Propulsid settlements were worth between $84 million and $105 million total. But most plaintiffs—99.4 percent—got nothing. Only 37 of 6,012 plaintiffs received anything, and collectively it was less than $6.5 million. Lead attorneys like the red-faced lawyer had made money not only by settling their own clients’ cases but by spearheading the lawsuit. For that work, defendant Johnson & Johnson paid them—the plaintiffs’ lawyers (!)—a whopping $27 million.

How could the injured get so little while their lawyers purchased private jets?

Now, surrounded by the Moulin Rouge feel of the Bellagio, I made my way up to the dais and laid out those damning numbers in the lawyers’ den, where I was the only thing standing between them and lunch with legendary running back Emmitt Smith.

But nothing would change. The status quo benefited the key stakeholders: The in crowd of plaintiffs’ attorneys got richer. Corporate defendants found settlements cheaper by the thousand. And judges received accolades when massive cases settled quickly—despite secret terms that typically made the money impossible to follow.

Plaintiffs were the ones who suffered. I knew because I’d spoken with them when their lawyers had not.

Afterward, those titans of tort seemed to have retained only one thing: that they were ranked on a list of lawyers chosen to command these cases. Never mind that it was a roster of the infamous, not the famous.

I wandered next door into the exhibit hall, where rows of tables were strapped with plastic banners and heaped with leaflets, mints, lens cleaners, highlighters, and tote bags. Herds of plaintiffs’ lawyers in suits, buttoned-down polo shirts, and the occasional high heels meandered past vendor booths hawking services for everything from medical records retrieval and client ads to law firm loans and settlement administration.

Those were the invisible hands greasing the wheels of mass torts, hands that propelled injured people through a maze they knew nothing about. I’d written about the industry for well over a decade, but I had no idea how vast it was until I saw its inner workings on display. Only much later would I realize that it wasn’t so much a smorgasbord of vendors as it was the Gorgon Medusa: When one head is removed, more sprout in its place.

Later, in the airport terminal, a slim, silver-haired conference attendee confirmed the snippets of hushed chatter I’d overheard in the Bellagio’s hallways. Something darker than lawyers’ self-dealing was stirring, and it involved pelvic mesh. An estimated 10 million women worldwide have pelvic mesh in their bodies, and hundreds of thousands of them were suing. The case would be bigger than the BP oil spill and Vioxx combined. Once the leviathan of profit for companies like Johnson & Johnson and Boston Scientific, pelvic mesh was now the white whale of liability for mass tort plaintiffs’ attorneys.

Pelvic mesh settlements were expected to total $11 billion, and everyone in the industry wanted a piece. Lead attorneys would receive $366 million of that in common-benefit fees for their work on behalf of all plaintiffs. With each plaintiff’s contingent fees ranging from 33 to 45 percent, non-lead lawyers would net between $3.63 billion and $4.95 billion, excluding costs. (As costs, one attorney charged a mesh client $575 for his steak dinner, $5,000 for his private plane, and $6,630 in interest.)

And the injured women? Their settlements would average $40,000 before fees and costs.

Though I’d escaped Las Vegas without needing a SEAL Team Six rescue, I soon found myself submerged in the legal system’s gritty underbelly, tracking a network of con men, bankrupt surgeons, chiropractors, medical funders, and lawyers who yearned to be insiders—all of them willing to do anything for a buck.

In that legal netherworld, women weren’t just plaintiffs. They were cash machines.

The plan was never to become an ICE agent.

The plan, when I went to the Immigration and Customs Enforcement Career Expo in Texas last August, was to learn what it was like to apply to be an ICE agent. Who wouldn’t be curious? The event promised on-the-spot hiring for would-be deportation officers: Walk in unemployed, walk out with a sweet $50k signing bonus, a retirement account, and a license to brutalize the country’s most vulnerable residents without consequence—all while wrapped in the warm glow of patriotism.

At first glance, my résumé has enough to tantalize a recruiter for America’s Gestapo-in-waiting: I enlisted in the Army straight out of high school and deployed to Afghanistan twice with the 82nd Airborne Division. After I got out, I spent a few years doing civilian analyst work. With a carefully arranged, skills-based résumé—one which omitted my current occupation—I figured I could maybe get through an initial interview.

The catch, however, is that there’s only one “Laura Jedeed” with an internet presence, and it takes about five seconds of Googling to figure out how I feel about ICE, the Trump administration, and the country’s general right-wing project. My social media pops up immediately, usually with a preview of my latest posts condemning Trump’s unconstitutional, authoritarian power grab. Scroll down and you’ll find articles with titles like “What I Saw in LA Wasn’t an Insurrection; It Was a Police Riot” and “Inside Mike Johnson’s Ties to a Far-Right Movement to Gut the Constitution.” Keep going for long enough and you might even find my dossier on AntifaWatch, a right-wing website that lists alleged members of the supposed domestic terror organization. I am, to put it mildly, a less-than-ideal recruit.

In short, I figured—at least back then—that my military background would be enough to get me in the door for a good look around ICE’s application process, and then even the most cursory background check would get me shown that same door with great haste.

The ICE expo in the Dallas area, where my application journey began, required attendees to register for a specific time slot, presumably to prevent throngs of eager patriots from flooding the event and overwhelming the recruiters. But when I showed up at 9 a.m., the flood was notably absent: there was no line to check in and no line to go through security. I walked down nearly empty hallways, past a nearly empty drug testing station, and into the event proper, where a man directed me to a line to wait in for an interview. I took my spot at the end; there were only six people ahead of me.

While I waited, I looked around the ESports Stadium Arlington—an enormous blacked-out event space optimized for video game tournaments that has a capacity of 2,500. During my visit, there couldn’t have been more than 150 people there.

Hopeful hires stood in tiny groups or found seats in the endless rows of cheap folding chairs that faced a stage ripped straight from Tron. Everything was bright-blue and lit-up and sci-fi-future angular. Above the monolithic platform hung three large monitors. The side monitors displayed static propaganda posters that urged the viewer to DEFEND THE HOMELAND and JOIN ICE TODAY, while the large central monitor played two short videos on loop: about 10 minutes of propaganda footage, again and again and again.

After about 15 minutes of waiting, an extraordinarily normal-looking middle-aged woman waved me forward. I sat across the black folding table from her on one of the uncomfortable black chairs. She asked for my name and date of birth, then whether I am over 40 (I am 38). Did I have law enforcement experience? No. Military experience? Yes. Did I retire from the military at 20+ years, or leave once my enlistment was up? The latter, I told her, then repeated my carefully rehearsed, completely true explanation for why the résumé I’d submitted had a large gap. “I had a little bit of a quarter-life crisis. Ended up going to college for part of that time, and since then I’ve been kind of—gig economy stuff.”

She was spectacularly uninterested: “OK. And what location is your preference?”

After some dithering, I settled on my home state of New York. That was the last question; the entire process took less than six minutes. The woman took my résumé and placed the form she’d been filling out on top. “They are prioritizing current law enforcement first. They’re going to adjudicate your résumé,” she told me. If my application passed muster, I’d receive an email about next steps, which could arrive in the next few hours but would likely take a few days. I left, thanked her for her time, and prepared to hear back never.

The expo event was part of ICE’s massive recruitment campaign for the foot soldiers it needs to execute the administration’s dream of a deportation campaign large enough to shift America’s demographic balance back whiteward. You’ve probably seen evidence of it yourself: ICE’s “Defend the homeland” propaganda is ubiquitous enough to be the Uncle Sam “I Want You” poster of our day, though somewhere in there our nation lost the plot about the correct posture toward Nazis.

When Donald Trump took office, ICE numbered approximately 10,000. Despite this event’s lackluster attendance, their recruitment push is reportedly going well; the agency reported 12,000 new recruits in 2025, which means the agency has more new recruits than old hands. That’s the kind of growth that changes the culture of an agency.

Many of ICE’s critics worry that the agency is hoovering up pro-Trump thugs—Jan. 6 insurrectionists, white nationalists, etc.—for a domestic security force loyal to the president. The truth, my experience suggests, is perhaps even scarier: ICE’s recruitment push is so sloppy that the administration effectively has no idea who’s joining the agency’s ranks. We’re all, collectively, in the dark about whom the state is arming, tasking with the most sensitive of law enforcement work, and then sending into America’s streets. And we are all, collectively, discovering just how deadly of an arrangement that really is.

At the end of my brief interview, the recruiter mentioned I could talk to a current deportation officer about what the job would be like. There was no line to talk to a deportation officer (did I mention how empty the place was?) and so I walked up, introduced myself to one of them, and asked about day-to-day duties.

I shouldn’t expect to hit the streets right away, the agent told me. Odds were good I’d get a support position first—something like the Criminal Alien Program office. “Let’s say a local police officer arrests someone out in the field for a DUI. Extremely common. Or beating their wife or whatever—all the typical crimes they commit,” he said. (The “they” here being “undocumented immigrants,” and while it’s extremely difficult to measure, evidence suggests that “they” actually commit crimes at a lower rate than U.S.-born citizens.)

If the cops suspect they’re dealing with an immigrant who doesn’t have permanent legal status, they alert ICE, whose agents conduct interviews and run record checks.If this preliminary investigation suggests that status, the person ends up in the Criminal Alien Program office for processing—which is where I would come in. “What you see on TV, with us arresting people and doing all kinds of crazy things, that’s maybe 10 percent. The other 90 percent is essentially doing a bunch of paperwork,” the agent said. “It takes a lot to remove somebody from the United States. Some people are subject to due process.”

The officer ran down other departments I might end up in: Prosecutions, Removal Coordination Unit, or Detention. The point being that I should not expect to be a badass street officer on Day 1. “I have so many guys that come over to me, they’re like, ‘I’m gonna put cuffs on somebody. I’m gonna arrest somebody.’ Well, you need to master this first and then we’ll see about getting you on the field.”

I told him that I was fine with office work—with my analyst background, it seemed like a better fit for my skill set anyway. His attitude shift was subtle, but instant and unmistakable; this was the wrong attitude and the wrong answer. “Just to be upfront, the goal is to put as many guns and badges out in the field as possible,” he said.

The agent then told me a bit about his own background. Like me, he enlisted straight out of high school, then got out and vowed to get as far away from the violence of the military as possible. Like a lot of veterans, he had trouble assimilating into the civilian world. “After about six months, I was like, ‘These people aren’t like me. I want to be around like-minded people.’ ” He found his way into law enforcement. That was well over a decade ago—he’s on his way to a very comfortable retirement, and he enjoys the work. “I like that instant gratification of Hey, that guy committed this crime, these X, Y, and Z, he’s not even supposed to be here,” he said.

I do not agree with his framing, but have no trouble understanding the appeal. Hell, it’s why I enlisted in the first place. Thankfully, Afghanistan beat it out of me. If I believed what he believed, I would surely do the same thing he’s doing.

I thanked him for the information and time, shook his hand, and took a seat on one of those uncomfortable folding chairs. I had a few hours before my flight back to New York City, and it made more sense to hang out than to flee the building and get good and airport drunk, regardless of how desperately I would have preferred the latter. Instead, I settled in to do what everyone does at the DMV: check my phone and people-watch. The aspiring officers fall broadly into three categories: thick-necked law enforcement types who look like they do steroids but don’t know how to work out, bearded spec-ops wannabes who look like they take steroids and do know how to work out, and dorks. Pencil-necked misfits. I couldn’t tell whether there were more white or Hispanic people waiting for their email, but it was close. A few Black applicants rounded out the overwhelmingly male group.

I’d been sitting around for about an hour when the video suddenly stopped and a bearded man in a black suit stepped onto the stage. He did not introduce himself—we were, I gathered, supposed to already know who he was—but it became clear he’s a senior agent of some sort. “I figured it would be best if I break up the same video you’ve been watching for the last four hours,” he said, and offered to answer any questions we might have.

One person asked about work/life balance, which the agent said is possible but not the route he’s chosen. Someone else wanted to know about travel opportunities and he talked about the many places he’s gone as part of the job.

Every other question during the 45 minutes the agent stood onstage pertained to the hiring process or what we could expect in training. Law enforcement types seemed especially concerned about the painful parts: Would they have to get pepper sprayed again? Would they have to get shot with a taser if they’d already qualified? Yes and probably not, respectively. The agent took the opportunity to gush about ICE’s new state-of-the-art semi-automatic tasers and brand-new pepper-ball guns. “It’s mostly very liberal cities—San Francisco, Los Angeles—where groups will come and try to stop ICE officers from arresting somebody. They’re like, ‘We’re going to form a human wall against you,’ ” he said. “When they do that, you can just pop ‘em up. Let them disperse and cry about it.”

When, during a moment of protracted silence, the agent threatened to put the video back on if no one had questions, I asked about harassment and doxing. “We will prosecute people to the fullest extent of the law,” he assured me, “and then people like myself will go on TV and publicly talk about how that person is now in prison to dissuade other people from doing it.”

As empty as the place had been when I’d arrived, it was even emptier by the time the senior agent ended the Q&A. Somebody vastly overestimated the number of Americans willing to take a job brutalizing and disappearing hard-working men and women—even with a potential $50K bonus, even in this economy.

That may have something to do with what happened to me next.

I completely missed the email when it came. I’d kept an eye on my inbox for the next few days, but I’d grown lax when nothing came through. But then, on Sept. 3, it popped up.

“Please note that this is a TENTATIVE offer only, therefore do not end your current employment,” the email instructed me. It then listed a series of steps I’d need to quickly take. I had 48 hours to log onto USAJobs and fill out my Declaration for Federal Employment, then five additional days to return the forms attached to the email. Among these forms: driver’s license information, an affidavit that I’ve never received a domestic violence conviction, and consent for a background check. And it said: “If you are declining the position, it is not necessary to complete the action items listed below.”

As I mentioned, I’d missed the email, so I did exactly none of these things.

And that might have been where this all ended—an unread message sinking to the bottom of my inbox—if not for an email LabCorp sent three weeks later. “Thank you for confirming that you wish to continue with the hiring process,” it read. (To be clear, I had confirmed no such thing.) “Please complete your required pre-employment drug test.”

The timing was unfortunate. Cannabis is legal in the state of New York, and I had partaken six days before my scheduled test. Then again, I hadn’t smoked much; perhaps with hydration I could get to the next stage. Worst-case scenario, I’d waste a small piece of ICE’s gargantuan budget. I traveled to my local LabCorp, peed in a cup, and waited for a call telling me I’d failed.

Nine days later, impatience got the best of me. For the first time, I logged into USAJobs and checked my application to see if my drug test had come through. What I actually saw was so implausible, so impossible, that at first I did not understand what I was looking at.

Somehow, despite never submitting any of the paperwork they sent me—not the background check or identification info, not the domestic violence affidavit, none of it—ICE had apparently offered me a job.

According to the application portal, my pre-employment activities remained pending. And yet, it also showed that I had accepted a final job offer and that my onboarding status was “EOD”—Entered On Duty, the start of an enlistment period. I moused over the exclamation mark next to “Onboarding” and a helpful pop-up appeared. “Your EOD has occurred. Welcome to ICE!”

I clicked through to my application tracking page. They’d sent my final offer on Sept. 30, it said, and I had allegedly accepted. “Welcome to Ice. … Your duty location is New York, New York. Your EOD was on Tuesday, September 30th, 2025.”

By all appearances, I was a deportation officer. Without a single signature on agency paperwork, ICE had officially hired me.

Perhaps, if I’d accepted, they would have demanded my pre-employment paperwork, done a basic screening, realized their mistake, and fired me immediately. And yet, the pending and upcoming tasks list suggested a very different outcome. My physical fitness test had been initiated on Oct. 6, it said: three days in the future. My medical check had apparently been completed on Oct. 6.

The portal also listed my background check as completed on Oct. 6. Had I preemptively passed? Was ICE seriously going to let me start training without finding out the first thing about me? I reached out to ICE for an explanation, but never heard back.

The only thing left for me to do was press the green “Accept” button on the home page. And maybe I should have. Maybe no one would have ever checked my name and I could have written the story of a lifetime. Or maybe the agency infamous for brutalizing and disappearing people with no regard for the law or basic human rights would have figured out exactly who I am while I was in one of their facilities with no way to escape. I’m not actually a domestic terrorist sent straight from Antifa headquarters, but to a paranoid fascist regime increasingly high on their own supply, I sure look like one on paper. Self-preservation won out.

I hit “Decline,” closed my browser, and took a long, deep breath.

What are we to make of all this? To be clear, I barely applied to ICE. I skipped the steps of the application process that would have clued the agency in on my lack of fitness for the position. I made no effort to hide my public loathing of the agency, what it stands for, and the administration that runs it. And they offered me the job anyway.

It’s possible that I’m an aberration—perhaps I experienced some kind of computer glitch that affected my application and no one else’s. But given all of the above, it seems far more likely that ICE is running an extremely leaky ship when it comes to recruitment.

With no oversight and with ICE concealing its agents’ identities, it’ll be extremely difficult for us to know.

There’s a temptation to take some comfort in ICE’s sloppiness. There’s a real argument here that an agency so inept in its recruitment will also be inept at training people and carrying out its mission. We’re seeing some very sloppy police work from ICE, including an inability to do basic things like throw someone down and cuff them. On some level, all of this is a reminder that their takeover is neither total nor inevitable.

But if they missed the fact that I was an anti-ICE journalist who didn’t fill out her paperwork, what else might they be missing? How many convicted domestic abusers are being given guns and sent into other people’s homes? How many people with ties to white supremacist organizations are indiscriminately targeting minorities on principle, regardless of immigration status? How many rapists and pedophiles are working in ICE detention centers with direct and unsupervised access to a population that will be neither believed nor missed? How are we to trust ICE’s allegedly thorough investigations of the people they detain and deport when they can’t even keep their HR paperwork straight?

And if they’re not going to screen me out, what hope is there of figuring out which recruit might one day turn into a trigger-happy agent who would forget that law enforcement officers are trained not to stand in front of vehicles, get jumpy, and shoot a 37-year-old woman to death on the streets of Minneapolis?  That’s exactly what happened last week, and why Renee Good will never have a 38th birthday, and why her children will never again be hugged by their mother.

By all appearances, the only thing ICE is screening for is a desire to work for ICE: a very specific kind of person perfectly suited for the kind of mission creep we are currently seeing. Good’s murder is not an isolated incident; the American Civil Liberties Union reports a nationwide trend of ICE pointing guns at, brutalizing, and even detaining citizens who stop to film them. A Minneapolis pastor who protested ICE by chanting “We are not afraid” was detained at gunpoint by an agent who reportedly asked him: “Are you afraid now?”

Update, Jan. 13, 2026: This article has been updated to clarify the location of ICE’s Texas hiring expo in August.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Memory makers just can&#39;t churn out their DRAM fast enough. On the heels of an AI-driven shortage, SK Hynix on Tuesday announced a new 19 trillion Korean won (about $13 billion) advanced packaging and test facility in South Korea that could offer some relief - just not for consumer products like laptops and phones.

The South Korean memory giant unveiled the new site, dubbed P&T7, which will be located at the Cheongju Technopolis Industrial Park in Chungbuk, South Korea. Work on the plant is expected to begin in April with completion targeted for the end of 2027.

The site aims to address surging demand for high-bandwidth memory (HBM) modules used extensively in datacenter GPUs and AI accelerators. Between 2025 and 2030, SK expects HBM demand to grow by an average of 33 percent a year, fueled in no small part by extreme demand for AI infrastructure.

HBM is manufactured by stacking multiple layers of DRAM - eight and 12 layers are most common - to achieve higher capacity and bandwidth while reducing energy consumption in the process.

The process is incredibly expensive, as a single defect in any of the layers could render the final module worthless. Worse, because of HBM&#39;s prodigious data rates - as high as 2.75 TB/s per module in the latest generations - the chips usually need to be permanently co-packaged alongside the compute logic. This makes the margin incredibly tight. Defective modules could scrap a $50,000 GPU.

Because of this, specialized packaging and test facilities, like SK&#39;s newly announced P&T7 site, are essential to producing HBM in volume.

Development of the P&T7 facility comes as SK Hynix prepares to bring its M15X DRAM plant online. Announced in 2024, the 20 trillion won (about $13.5 billion) DRAM plant was built to address growing HBM demand. It opened its clean room in October and, according to SK, work to deploy fab equipment is progressing smoothly.

While the new packaging site may be welcome news for the likes of AMD or Nvidia - two of the largest consumers of HBM memory - the packaging site will likely do little to address skyrocketing memory prices seen by consumers and businesses over the past few months. While HBM has appeared in consumer products in the past, its extreme cost and complexity usually preclude its use in modern client devices.

DDR5 memory kits that, a year ago, sold for less than $100 are now going for well in excess of $300 as vendors grapple with the ongoing DRAM and NAND crunch.

As we previously reported, DRAM prices are expected to remain high for the next several years, driven in part by strong demand for AI infrastructure. Analysts predict DRAM prices to peak later this year before plateauing in 2027, and rising again in 2028.

While customers pay through the nose, memory vendors are raking in billions of dollars of revenue. Last week, Samsung issued a revised Q4 forecast in which it predicted its operating profits would more than triple, while Micron and SK Hynix&#39;s profits are expected to more than double. ®

            <p><strong>The Register | 2026-01-13</strong></p>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Chinese companies may be unable to import the best US GPUs, but they have found a workaround: renting access to that hardware via cloud services. Now, the US House of Representatives is moving to bring that loophole under the export-control law.

The House of Representatives passed the Remote Access Security Act on Monday by an overwhelming 369-22 bipartisan vote. The bill extends the US Export Control Reform Act to treat certain forms of remote access to export-controlled items - including high-end GPUs and other AI chips - as subject to US export-control law.

&quot;Our export controls are only as strong as the weakest link, and right now, the CCP has a real tool to sidestep these prohibitions,&quot; said bill sponsor Representative Mike Lawler (R-NY).

It&#39;s not like that&#39;s a hypothetical scenario, either: Chinese companies faced with export controls on high-end Nvidia GPUs and other chips have been acquiring access to them through platforms like Amazon Web Services since at least 2023.

According to our prior reporting, Chinese cloud providers such as Alibaba and Tencent may be enabling access to export-controlled GPUs for China-based customers by renting cloud hardware hosted outside the country. Microsoft and AWS, meanwhile, reportedly operate in China via local partners that offer cloud services broadly similar to those available elsewhere.

In short, this is a very real loophole in US export control laws - the chips aren&#39;t going anywhere, after all. This being the internet age, location doesn&#39;t really matter.

&quot;This bill brings our laws into the digital age and makes it clear that cloud compute is subject to U.S. export control law, just like physical chips,&quot; said House Select Committee on China chairman Representative John Moolenaar (R-MI). &quot;Closing these loopholes will strengthen U.S. national security and protect American innovation.&quot;

Passage of the bill through the Senate, and a signature from President Trump, aren&#39;t guarantees, and it&#39;s unknown how the upper chamber and the White House feel about the bill. We reached out to Lawler&#39;s team for more information, but didn&#39;t hear back.

It&#39;s also worth noting that the export of powerful AI chips from the US to China isn&#39;t as locked down as it was when this bill was introduced in April of 2025. Since then, the Trump administration has given Nvidia the go-ahead to sell H200 chips in China, and while not the most advanced Nvidia has to offer, they&#39;re definitely powerful.

Beijing has yet to give its stamp of approval to Nvidia for imports, but it&#39;s believed that they&#39;re likely to do so soon.

That said, China has been pushing its own chip companies to ditch American imports over national security concerns and instead develop its own competitive alternatives, a process that may still take time, though likely not much. ®

This is according to Forrester veep and principal analyst J.P. Gownder, who states in a blog: &quot;To give you a sense of the magnitude, the US lost 8.7 million jobs during the Great Recession. The numbers aren&#39;t directly comparable, since jobs lost to AI are structural and permanent while those lost during a recession are cyclical and macroeconomic. But no matter how you view it, the numbers are meaningful and worthy of our attention.&quot;

The US population has also grown since the early part of this century, further muddying the waters when talking about absolute numbers.

The &quot;real but modest impact&quot; that Forrester models between 2025 and 2030 suggests that the replacement of large chunks of the workforce remains unlikely, &quot;as labor productivity would need to accelerate significantly for AI to replace human talent at scale.&quot;

The more realistic scenario, it says, is that AI will &quot;augment&quot; one in five roles at the end of the forecast period, indicating employers may need to invest in staff training to prepare them for a new age.

In the tech world, some of the SaaS providers are already making moves to replace parts of the workforce, including Salesforce, Workday, and ServiceNow.

Still, risks remain. Forrester says there is a danger that &quot;over-automating roles&quot; based on the &quot;hype surrounding&quot; AI can result in &quot;costly pullbacks, damaged reputations, and weakened employee experiences.&quot;

Some businesses – Duolingo and Klarna spring to mind – rowed back their efforts to replace meatbags with AI. Forrester last year said it expects 55 percent of corporations to regret the decision to press ahead with these types of projects and quietly rehire people.

Forrester today cites a million US layoffs in 2025 with some attributed to AI. Gownder recalls discussions with clients that want advice on laying off 20 percent of their staff in the lurch toward AI.

&quot;When we ask if they have a mature, vetted AI app ready to fill in those jobs, nine out of ten times, the answer is no – and they haven&#39;t even started. So most of the layoffs are financially driven and AI is just the scapegoat, at least today.&quot;

So what has changed since Forrester&#39;s previous AI jobs forecast in 2023? Agentic AI has hit the market, and organizations are using it to create applications Forrester claims are more accurate – though not according to everyone – and solve specific problems.

Generative AI projects, both successes and failures, are also teaching the market how to get better results, Gownder says.

&quot;Where our earlier forecast saw just 29 percent of US jobs lost to automation coming from GenAI, that number is now 50 percent, which accounts for agentic AI solutions that leverage GenAI as well.&quot;

As for the 20 percent of positions that will be influenced by AI, this &quot;represents a nearly fourfold increase compared with our 2023 forecast.&quot;

All of which means that while jobs will be going, &quot;we&#39;re not heading for an imminent AI job apocalypse.&quot; AI might take over some workflows and tasks, but in the next five years, Forrester thinks that work will be mostly undertaken by humans. ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">President Trump says tech giants must pay their way when it comes to delivering increased power needed for datacenters, rather than the burden falling on US citizens, and it seems Microsoft is on board with that.

Trump issued his latest edict via his Truth Social media platform, declaring: &quot;I never want Americans to pay higher Electricity bills because of Data Centers.&quot;

The Trump administration is working with major US technology companies to secure their commitment, he added, saying: &quot;First up is Microsoft, who my team has been working with, and which will make major changes beginning this week to ensure that Americans don&#39;t &#39;pick up the tab&#39; for their POWER consumption, in the form of paying higher Utility bills.&quot;

This is a new concern for the President, who last year assured the tech oligarchy during a convivial dinner hosted at the White House that he would ensure they got as much energy as they needed to retain US leadership in the AI arms race.

Microsoft has responded to the Presidential decree with what it is calling &quot;Community-First AI Infrastructure.&quot; This might sound like a contradiction in terms, but Microsoft insists it wants &quot;to be a good neighbor in the communities where we build, own, and operate our datacenters.&quot;

In a blog post, vice chair and president Brad Smith says tech companies have a unique opportunity to deliver the advances AI is expected to bring, plus a responsibility to address new challenges it creates.

In June 2025, Val Walsh, Microsoft&#39;s VP for Cloud Operations & Innovation, complained at the Datacloud Global Congress event in France: &quot;we have communities that don&#39;t want us there,&quot; and criticized the &quot;lack of alignment from the general public&quot; as to why datacenters are necessary.

The Community-First AI Infrastructure Initiative provides a framework to address community-related challenges, Smith explained today, based on five commitments from Microsoft:

On paying its way, Smith said Microsoft will ask utility companies to set its electricity rates high enough to cover the electricity costs for its datacenters, including the costs of expanding the electricity infrastructure.

However, in a telling aside, he commented: &quot;Some have suggested that AI will be so beneficial that the public should help pay for the added electricity the country needs for it.&quot; Of course, others have also suggested that AI is a bubble waiting to burst, and that many are likely to be impacted by the fallout once it does.

On the other promises, Microsoft reiterates that it is committed to reducing the amount of water its datacenters use, claiming this will equate to &quot;a 40 percent improvement in datacenter water use intensity by 2030.&quot; But as we reported back in 2023, the company&#39;s water consumption actually surged 34 percent to 6.4 million cubic meters the previous year.

Microsoft also pledges to create jobs, although opponents of datacenters are quick to point out that while these facilities may employ thousands during construction, once up and running, the number of permanent positions may be as few as 50.

However, major infrastructure expansion is always difficult, Smith concluded. &quot;It&#39;s expensive. It inevitably raises questions, concerns, and even controversies.&quot;

Private companies can help, he added, by &quot;stepping up and acting in a responsible way. We cannot surmount inevitable community challenges by ourselves. But we can make everything easier by embracing a long-term vision. By recognizing our responsibility. By playing a constructive role. And by supporting the entire community.&quot; ®

            <h2>Linus Torvalds tries vibe coding, world still intact somehow</h2>
            <p><strong>The Register | 2026-01-13</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2026/01/13/linus_torvalds_vibe_coding/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Perhaps the most famous low-level systems programmer has tried &quot;vibe coding&quot; for himself – and he seems to be enjoying it.

Linus Torvalds is best known as the leader of the Linux kernel project, the single biggest FOSS project. It&#39;s not the only thing he works on, though. A few days ago he revealed his latest side project, AudioNoise, which he describes as creating &quot;random digital audio effects&quot; using the &quot;random guitar pedal board design&quot; he unveiled last year. The README file contains something unexpected:

Also note that the python visualizer tool has been basically written by vibe-coding. I know more about analog filters – and that&#39;s not saying much – than I do about python. It started out as my typical &quot;google and do the monkey-see-monkey-do&quot; kind of programming, but then I cut out the middle-man – me – and just used Google Antigravity to do the audio sample visualizer.

(Yes, some of us do use en/em-dashes in informal writing.)

We recently wrote about Torvalds&#39; atypically subtle and nuanced position on the use of LLM bots in coding. It seems that the reasons have suddenly become a little clearer.

Google&#39;s Antigravity LLM has been winning other friends of late, including Register columnist Mark Pesce, who wrote that &quot;vibe coding will deliver a wonderful proliferation of personalized software.&quot; Some other big names in the world of FOSS have also come out in favor of LLM coding assistants recently, including Redis creator Salvatore &quot;Antirez&quot; Sanfilippo, who wrote &quot;don&#39;t fall into the anti-AI hype.&quot; Said hype is, of course, a subject about which Torvalds opined previously.

Torvalds&#39; position has been more moderate, which is not entirely like his former self. He is famed for his outbursts at Nvidia, GitHub, third-party companies, and kernel contributors. We could go on, but you get the picture.

In an on-stage chat with Dirk Hohndel at the Open Source Summit Asia in November, he said that he was OK with vibe coding as long as it&#39;s not used for anything that matters. Adding Raspberry Pi-driven audio effects to his homegrown guitar pedal seems like a fair example.

Torvalds also has other hobby programming and electronics projects. Exactly one year ago as we write, The Register reported on his fondness for building guitar pedals. Another notable one is Subsurface, the SCUBA dive-logging software he co-wrote with the same Dirk Hohndel. As he told Divelog.blue in 2018, he and Hohndel are also diving buddies. As we have mentioned before, there are other things about Subsurface that you might not expect, such as that it uses Qt and C++.

It was some 25 years ago now, but &quot;Just For Fun&quot; is the title of Linus&#39;s 2001 autobiography, co-written with David Diamond – also known as the keyboard player from synthpop band Berlin. This vulture enjoyed the book, and there&#39;s a scan on the Internet Archive. ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Dutch police believe they have arrested a man behind the AVCheck online platform - a service used by cybercrims that Operation Endgame shuttered in May.

The country&#39;s public prosecutor&#39;s office (LP) issued a statement on Monday, confirming the arrest of a 33-year-old Dutchman in connection with its investigation into the malware service, without specifying it or the man by name.

Officials said he was arrested at Schiphol Airport in Amsterdam on Sunday evening, but did not reveal what he was doing there. The unnamed individual did, however, deregister in the Netherlands around the time of the AVCheck bust and fled to the United Arab Emirates, the LP said.

&quot;The suspect had been under international surveillance for some time when he was arrested by the Royal Netherlands Marechaussee at Schiphol Airport on Sunday,&quot; it said. &quot;Data storage devices belonging to the man were seized.&quot;

The alleged AVCheck mastermind and two companies tied to him are suspected of enabling cybercriminals and malware developers to access the online platform.

AVCheck was taken down on May 27, 2025, as part of Operation Endgame&#39;s second burst of operational activity.

The takedown was coordinated between authorities in the Netherlands, United States, and Finland, and the intelligence gathered from that led to the identification of, and resulting investigation into, the man now in custody.

AVCheck was a website criminals used to test their malware against different antivirus providers&#39; products to see which detection systems it could evade.

It essentially gave baddies a tool to see which organization was worth targeting based on the information gathered during an attack&#39;s reconnaissance phase.

The platform was described as one of the largest counter-antivirus (CAV) services in the world, and played a significant role in the cybercrime ecosystem.

&quot;Cybercriminals don&#39;t just create malware; they perfect it for maximum destruction,&quot; said Douglas Williams, special agent in charge at FBI Houston at the time.

&quot;By leveraging counter-antivirus services, malicious actors refine their weapons against the world&#39;s toughest security systems to better slip past firewalls, evade forensic analysis, and wreak havoc across victims&#39; systems.&quot; ®

            <div id="article-text">New US dietary guidelines promote more protein and beef tallow, potentially moving Americans further away from a low-carbon diet.

New US dietary guidelines promote more protein and beef tallow, potentially moving Americans further away from a low-carbon diet.

The Trump administration announced last week that it wants Americans to consume more protein, churning out a colorful illustration of an inverted food pyramid that prominently features a big, red steak, a wedge of cheese, and a carton of whole milk at the top and claiming it’s “ending the war on protein.” It may seem like another example of cartoonish propaganda from an administration that essentially runs on memes, but don’t be fooled: It signals a marked turn from previous advice that encouraged Americans to limit high-fat sources of protein like red meat and whole milk for their health, which can incidentally also curb planet-heating pollution from the beef and dairy industries.

“The milk mustache is back,” says an X post from the US Department of Agriculture showing an image of President Donald Trump sporting one while leaning over a glass of milk.

There’s been plenty of debate over how fair it is to judge individual consumers for the carbon footprint of food systems, especially when a person’s choices might be limited. Plus, the environmental impact of what we eat depends a lot on the way industries conduct their business, experts tell The Verge. Besides, the US stopped using the food pyramid as an official guide in 2011, and survey data shows Americans don’t follow federal nutritional recommendations anyway. But if the Trump administration’s new dietary guidelines actually result in real changes to American food production and diets, that could wind up leading to more of the pollution that exacerbates climate change.

“I’m kind of a big believer in it all matters because at the end of the day, it is true that every action matters, and every ton of greenhouse gas omitted or not omitted matters,” says Richard Waite, director for agriculture initiatives at the nonprofit World Resources Institute (WRI).

Waite and his team estimated the hypothetical climate impact of Americans eating more protein in accordance with the updated federal guidelines. The Trump administration raised the recommendation to roughly 1.2–1.6 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight per day (about 0.54–0.73 grams per pound of body weight per day). Already, Americans eat about 1.0–1.3 grams per day — within the lower range of the new recommendations. However, if they moved up to the higher end of that range, that would be about a 25 percent increase in protein consumption.

WRI estimates that such an increase in Americans eating any kind of protein, whether it comes from animal or plant sources, could require up to 100 million acres of additional agricultural land each year, roughly as big as the state of California. The climate impact of that could be equivalent to hundreds of millions of tons of additional carbon dioxide emissions, according to WRI.

Waite is quick to caution that this is a thought experiment. Federal surveys show that American diets don’t align with recommendations for most food groups and nutrients, in part because folks are eating away from home more often, and those meals on the go are typically less nutritious. The cost and availability of healthy foods, including fresh fruits and vegetables, can also be a stumbling block.

The environmental impact of a meal varies depending on what sources of protein people eat. Cattle and other hoofed animals with similar digestive systems like sheep and goats are a bigger concern than chicken or plant-based proteins. Protein from meat requires more land for raising animals and growing their feed. Cows have a digestive process that’s less efficient at turning feed into food humans can eat. They also belch methane, a more potent greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide even though it’s shorter-lived in the atmosphere.

The climate impact could be equivalent to hundreds of millions of tons of additional carbon dioxide emissions

Fortunately, there are a lot of nuances that are likely to prevent a big rise in greenhouse gas emissions from protein consumption, according to Frank Mitloehner, a professor at the University of California, Davis Department of Animal Science. Americans have actually been eating a lot more chicken recently, while US consumption of beef has been relatively stable over the past decade. And even if the Trump administration is advising people to drink whole milk, it doesn’t necessarily have a larger climate impact than lower-fat alternatives, according to Mitloehner.

The important question to consider, for Mitloehner, is whether herd sizes will grow and agriculture will begin producing more beef and dairy. That’s unlikely in the near term, he says, considering the industry is already struggling to meet existing demand in the US. Heat waves and drought have cut herd sizes, and beef and dairy producers are on alert for potentially devastating screwworm parasites that have already been documented in Mexico near the US border.

“Many of the producers who have left the industry will not come back,” Mitloehner says. “And there’s no international supplier who can just fill that void.”

The number of cattle in the US has reached record-low levels. In part, that reflects big efficiency gains in how much meat and dairy you can produce from a single animal. Fewer than 90 million cattle are needed today to get the same amount of beef produced by 140 million cattle in the 1970s, according to UC Davis. The industry can raise an animal much faster today as a result of genetic and nutritional changes. Certain types of feed can even reduce the amount of methane a cow releases in its belches.

Many ranchers are still working to keep up those gains in efficiency and climate impact, at least in California, Mitloehner says. The Trump administration, on the other hand, is rolling back greenhouse gas pollution regulations and calling any efforts to address the effects of climate change — such as the heat and drought stressing cattle — a “green scam” while trying to bury previous federal research on the issue.

Some scientists and health and environmental advocates also now accuse President Trump and Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. of ignoring a previous scientific panel’s recommendations for the dietary guidelines. An “uncompromised” version of the new guidelines based on the most recent recommendations from the federal Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee (DGAC) would have advised Americans to “increase intake of beans, peas, lentils, nuts, seeds, and soy products and decrease intake of red and processed meat,” according to a report from the Center for Science in the Public Interest and the Center for Biological Diversity.

The number of cattle in the US has reached record-low levels

The federal guidelines are updated every five years, and reflected most of DGAC’s advice back in 2020. This time around, the Trump administration rejected more than half of DGAC’s 2024 recommendations, according to the Center for Science in the Public Interest. And several of the panelists involved in crafting this year’s guidelines disclosed financial ties to the beef and dairy industries. The existence of the Trump administration’s new scientific review panel and its industry ties was first reported by Stat News.

“Who selected them, why they were selected, and by what authority is anyone’s guess. [It] raises serious questions,” says Matthew Hayek, an associate professor at New York University’s Department of Environmental Studies. The Trump administration says in its supplementary analysis for the guidelines that “subject matter experts were selected through a federal contracting process based on demonstrated expertise,” a point that it reiterated in an email to The Verge.

The guidelines also reflect RFK’s promotion of cooking with beef tallow, a hallmark of the “Make America Healthy Again” attack on seed oils despite decades of scientific evidence showing the health benefits of cooking with plant-based oils rather than tallow, butter, and lard high in saturated fats. Seed oils have gotten a bad rap because they’re often used in ultra-processed foods, guilt by association that’s added to the growing hype around cooking with beef tallow. The American Heart Association put out a statement last week warning that consuming tallow is linked to higher cardiovascular risk (while also commending the new federal guidelines for advising people to limit highly processed foods and added sugars).

As the Trump administration takes a wrecking ball to federal science institutions and cherry-picks research it uses, Hayek says Americans can still rely on recommendations that are based on scientific consensus from the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics and the American Heart Association.

While most Americans don’t follow federal nutritional guidelines closely anyway, some big institutions do, Hayek notes, including federal nutrition programs. “If followed by even a few large institutions like our public school systems, [that] will serve to increase the greenhouse gas emissions and potentially decrease the health of American diets,” he says. “Individuals are also a product of the institutions that they engage with every day.”</div>

﻿Developers from Twisted Pixel Games and Sanzaru Games have posted about their studios being closed down.

Meta is laying off about 10 percent of its Reality Labs metaverse division, and the cuts include closing down some of its VR gaming studios.

Twisted Pixel Games, the developer of Marvel’s Deadpool VR, Sanzaru Games, the developer of the Asgard’s Wrath franchise, and Armature Studio, which worked on the Resident Evil 4 VR port, are all being closed down, according to an internal memo viewed by Bloomberg. The team behind the VR fitness app Supernatural will no longer develop new content or features for it, though the “existing product” will still be supported, Bloomberg says. Meta spokesperson Tracy Clayton confirmed to The Verge that Bloomberg’s reporting is accurate.

Laid off staffers have posted about the closures online.

Meta acquired Supernatural developer Within in 2023 (after a fight with the FTC), Twisted Pixel and Armature in 2022, and Sanzaru in 2020. The company closed Echo VR developer Ready at Dawn, which it also acquired in 2020, in 2024.

In a statement about the broader Reality Labs layoffs, Clayton said that “We said last month that we were shifting some of our investment from Metaverse toward Wearables. This is part of that effort, and we plan to reinvest the savings to support the growth of wearables this year.”

Update, January 13th: Added details from Bloomberg about the studio closures.

It’s worth pulling out a headset if you have one.

The Lego Smart Brick won our Best in Show award at CES 2026, and it was no wonder after watching Lego designer Maarten Simons’ expert demo there. So I thought: why not let you virtually attend the same tech demo I did? Before I left Las Vegas, I snuck back into Lego’s suite to film a 15-minute uncut immersive video of what these bricks can do.

It just so happens I brought an unusual camera to Las Vegas this year: a Qoocam Q3 Ultra modded for VR180 capture by Siyang Qi. It creates spatial stereoscopic 3D video that you can experience in a headset (like the Meta Quest), or tap-to-drag on a flat screen, or even tilt using the sensors in your phone.

To watch it on a Quest headset, you’ll want to tap this video here on the website or click this YouTube link while logged into your Google account. Then, open the YouTube VR app in your headset, tap your profile pic at the upper right, and select the History tab. It should be the newest video there.

For best results, tap the gear icon, and set video resolution as high as it will go (likely 2160s). We recorded and uploaded in 8K, not just 4K, but for some reason YouTube isn’t showing us full resolution yet. Fingers crossed it’ll appear later!

If this video stops working for whatever reason, you can find my original Lego Smart Brick hands-on video at YouTube, Instagram, or TikTok, and embedded below.

Is VR180 something subscribers would like to see more of? Let us know, but no promises — the video workflow isn’t as easy as I’d hoped!

The waiver will allow Verizon to unlock your phone after you finish paying it off, or following the end of your contract.

Verizon can keep phones locked to its network for longer after the Federal Communications Commission agreed to waive the carrier’s 60-day unlocking requirement, as reported by Ars Technica.

Following this decision, Verizon must follow a looser set of guidelines set by the CTIA wireless trade group, which says carriers should only unlock a customer’s postpaid phone after their contract is up, when they finish paying off the device, or following the payment of an early termination fee. Meanwhile, the CTIA’s code says carriers should unlock prepaid phones “no later than one year after initial activation.”

The change comes after Verizon asked the FCC to waive the 60-day unlocking requirement last year, arguing that it “benefits bad actors and fraudsters.” The FCC began requiring Verizon to unlock phones faster as a condition of its purchase of 700Mhz spectrum licenses in 2008. It later granted Verizon permission to wait 60 days until unlocking customers’ phones, a policy the carrier extended to Tracfone following its acquisition.

“Today, criminal networks are specifically targeting Verizon handsets due to the company’s unique unlocking policies,” the FCC’s filing says. “In total, the Commission’s current rules cost Verizon hundreds of millions of dollars each year in deadweight loss — money which could have been invested in network upgrades or consumer friendly deals.”

Now that the FCC has lifted the unlocking requirement, you might have to wait longer to switch to another carrier after activating a phone with Verizon. The FCC’s filing says the changes will go into effect at Verizon one day after the release of its order, adding that it will remain in effect until the FCC “decides on an appropriate industry-wide approach for the unlocking of handsets.”

The 2026 Nissan Murano and Pathfinder will both include Qi2-compatible wireless chargers with magnetic mounts.

Wireless phone chargers are now common in vehicles, but they’re typically missing one very useful feature. Nissan announced last month that it will be the first automaker in the US to offer wireless chargers with a magnetic mount, ensuring charging coils remain aligned for faster charging of mobile devices, even while a vehicle is in motion.

The Wireless Power Consortium’s Qi2 standard, which was finalized in late 2023, includes specifications on the use of magnets to help properly align the wireless coils in chargers and mobile devices. It was an idea first introduced by Apple with its MagSafe feature on the iPhone 12 lineup, but companies like Google have since adopted it. You now have to search hard to find a wireless charger that doesn’t use magnets, although you can always visit your nearest car dealership as the auto industry has yet to embrace the useful feature.

In the US, the 2026 Nissan Murano, and later the 2026 Pathfinder, will both feature Qi2-compatible wireless chargers in their center consoles with a raised magnetic mount. Power delivery maxes out at 15W – not the faster 25W rates available with Qi2.2 chargers – but Nissan includes an integrated cooling fan to reduce the risk of a phone shutting down due to overheating, and to improve charging efficiency. Behind the charger are also LEDs that glow orange when a phone is charging, and switch to green when it’s fully charged.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The automaker is instead forging ahead with its new point-to-point Level 2 system that rivals Tesla’s Full Self-Driving.

The automaker is instead forging ahead with its new point-to-point Level 2 system that rivals Tesla’s Full Self-Driving.

Mercedes-Benz is pausing the roll-out of Drive Pilot, an “eyes off” conditionally automated driving feature that was available in Europe and the US. As first reported by German publication Handelsblatt, the revised S-Class will not have the Level 3 system when it arrives at the end of this month.

Mercedes was one of the first automakers to offer a Level 3 driving system to its customers when it launched Drive Pilot with the electric EQS sedan and the gas-powered S-Class in the fall of 2023. At up to 40mph in traffic jam situations on highways, Drive Pilot provided hands-free, eyes-off driving that allows the driver to look away from the road at something else, like a game or a movie. It was big leap up from hands-free Level 2 systems — Tesla’s Autopilot and Full Self-Driving (FSD) included — which still require the driver to be in full control, looking ahead and paying attention while the system is active.

But now Mercedes says it is temporarily scrapping the feature, citing middling demand and the high production costs of developing the technology. On top of that, the automaker is getting ready to roll out a new Level 2++ feature called Drive Pilot Assist that is rolling out this year. The system is similar to Tesla’s FSD in that it can be used in cities but requires the driver to stay attentive.

Mercedes was one of the first automakers to offer a Level 3 driving system to its customers

“We don’t want to offer a system which customer-wise doesn’t have much benefits and we know another system will come with the next two [or] three years with much more customer benefit,” said Mercedes spokesperson Tobias Mueller.

Mueller said that Drive Pilot’s customer appeal was limited by its operational design domain, or ODD, meaning the set of specific circumstances and criteria that are necessary for the system to work. The system was only legal to use in Germany in Europe, and on certain highways in California and Nevada in the US. Mueller said Mercedes may decide to merge Drive Pilot with Drive Pilot Assist at some point in the future, when the regulatory environment is more favorable.

There were other conditions too. Drive Pilot would only work when there was a vehicle in front of the car, on roads with readable markings and lines, and in clear weather and light conditions. Drive Pilot couldn’t be used at night or in the rain, and the headlights and wipers must be set to auto for it to work. It was also only available on freeways that have been mapped by Mercedes, which further limited its use.

That said, Mercedes clearly reveled in being the first to market with a Level 3 system. When it was first introduced in 2023, our tester was able to play Tetris and cue up YouTube videos on the center infotainment screen while the car was in motion. In 2024, Mercedes upped the allowed speed limit while using Drive Pilot to 95km/h (59mph) from 64km/h (40mph).

In addition to the high costs of developing the technology, Mercedes also ran into problems with some of its sensor suppliers. One of the sensors underpinning Drive Pilot was lidar, a laser sensor that is widely used in robotaxi fleets. But the company was forced to terminate its deal with Luminar in 2024 after the lidar manufacturer failed to meet the requirements. (Luminar recently filed for bankruptcy.)

Mueller said that sensor redundancy from lidar was necessary to compensate for the limitations of cameras, such as glare from the sun or low light conditions. High-definition maps were also required, he said, though advances in AI may reduce reliance on extremely detailed maps over time by allowing systems to infer more from real-world perception.

To be sure, the practicality of Level 3 automation has been widely debated. There have been studies that show that the handoff between an automated system and a human driver can be especially fraught. When people are disconnected from driving for a long period of time, they may overreact when suddenly taking control in an emergency situation. They may overcorrect steering, brake too hard, or be unable to respond correctly because they haven’t been paying attention. Those actions can create a domino effect that has the potential to be dangerous — and perhaps even fatal.

Most fully autonomous companies, like Waymo and Cruise, have said they think Level 3 is too dangerous, preferring to work exclusively on Level 4 technology that cuts the driver completely out of the equation.

Sodium-ion batteries are making their way into cars—and the grid

For decades, lithium-ion batteries have powered our phones, laptops, and electric vehicles. But lithium’s limited supply and volatile price have led the industry to seek more resilient alternatives. Enter: sodium-ion batteries.

They work much like lithium-ion ones: they store and release energy by shuttling ions between two electrodes. But unlike lithium, a somewhat rare element that is currently mined in only a handful of countries, sodium is cheap and found everywhere. Read why it’s poised to become more important to our energy future.

Sodium-ion batteries are one of MIT Technology Review’s 10 Breakthrough Technologies this year. Take a look at what else made the list.

I decided to go to CES kind of at the last minute. Over the holiday break, contacts from China kept messaging me about their travel plans. After the umpteenth “See you in Vegas?” I caved. As a China tech writer based in the US, I have one week a year when my entire beat seems to come to me—no 20-hour flights required.

CES, the Consumer Electronics Show, is the world’s biggest tech show, where companies launch new gadgets and announce new developments, and it happens every January. China has long had a presence at CES, but this year it showed up in a big way. Chinese companies showcased everything from AI gadgets to household appliances to robots, and the overall mood among them was upbeat. Here’s why.This story was first featured in The Algorithm, our weekly newsletter giving you the inside story of what’s going on in AI. Sign up to receive it in your inbox every Monday.

At some point this month, a handful of volunteers will be injected with experimental gene therapies as part of an unusual clinical trial. The drugs are potential longevity therapies, says Ivan Morgunov, the CEO of Unlimited Bio, the company behind the trial.

The volunteers—who are covering their own travel and treatment costs—will receive a series of injections in their arms and legs. One of the therapies is designed to increase the blood supply to those muscles. The other is designed to support muscle growth. The company hopes to see improvements in strength, endurance, and recovery. It also plans to eventually trial similar therapies in the scalp (for baldness) and penis (for erectile dysfunction).

However, some experts warn the trial is too small, and likely won’t reveal anything useful. Read the full story.

While large language models that generate text have exploded in the last three years, a different type of AI, based on what are called diffusion models, is having an unprecedented impact on creative domains.

By transforming random noise into coherent patterns, diffusion models can generate new images, videos, or speech, guided by text prompts or other input data. The best ones can create outputs indistinguishable from the work of people.

Now these models are marching into a creative field that is arguably more vulnerable to disruption than any other: music. And their output encapsulates how difficult it’s becoming to define authorship and originality in the age of AI. Read the full story.

I decided to go to CES kind of at the last minute. Over the holiday break, contacts from China kept messaging me about their travel plans. After the umpteenth “See you in Vegas?” I caved. As a China tech writer based in the US, I have one week a year when my entire beat seems to come to me—no 20-hour flights required.

CES, the Consumer Electronics Show, is the world’s biggest tech show, where companies launch new gadgets and announce new developments, and it happens every January. This year, it attracted over 148,000 attendees and over 4,100 exhibitors. It sprawls across the Las Vegas Convention Center, the city’s biggest exhibition space, and spills over into adjacent hotels.

China has long had a presence at CES, but this year it showed up in a big way. Chinese exhibitors accounted for nearly a quarter of all companies at the show, and in pockets like AI hardware and robotics, China’s presence felt especially dominant. On the floor, I saw tons of Chinese industry attendees roaming around, plus a notable number of Chinese VCs. Multiple experienced CES attendees told me this is the first post-covid CES where China was present in a way you couldn’t miss. Last year might have been trending that way too, but a lot of Chinese attendees reportedly ran into visa denials. Now AI has become the universal excuse, and reason, to make the trip.

As expected, AI was the biggest theme this year, seen on every booth wall. It’s both the biggest thing everyone is talking about and a deeply confusing marketing gimmick. “We added AI” is slapped onto everything from the reasonable (PCs, phones, TVs, security systems) to the deranged (slippers, hair dryers, bed frames).

Consumer AI gadgets still feel early and of very uneven quality. The most common categories are educational devices and emotional support toys—which, as I’ve written about recently, are all the rage in China. There are some memorable ones: Luka AI makes a robotic panda that scuttles around and keeps a watchful eye on your baby. Fuzozo, a fluffy keychain-size AI robot, is basically a digital pet in physical form. It comes with a built-in personality and reacts to how you treat it. The companies selling these just hope you won’t think too hard about the privacy implications.

Ian Goh, an investor at 01.VC, told me China’s manufacturing advantage gives it a unique edge in AI consumer electronics, because a lot of Western companies feel they simply cannot fight and win in the arena of hardware.

Another area where Chinese companies seem to be at the head of the pack is household electronics. The products they make are becoming impressively sophisticated. Home robots, 360 cams, security systems, drones, lawn-mowing machines, pool heat pumps … Did you know two Chinese brands basically dominate the market for home cleaning robots in the US and are eating the lunch of Dyson and Shark? Did you know almost all the suburban yard tech you can buy in the West comes from Shenzhen, even though that whole backyard-obsessed lifestyle barely exists in China? This stuff is so sleek that you wouldn’t clock it as Chinese unless you went looking. The old “cheap and repetitive” stereotype doesn’t explain what I saw. I walked away from CES feeling that I needed a major home appliance upgrade.

Of course, appliances are a safe, mature market. On the more experiential front, humanoid robots were a giant magnet for crowds, and Chinese companies put on a great show. Every robot seemed to be dancing, in styles from Michael Jackson to K-pop to lion dancing, some even doing back flips. Hangzhou-based Unitree even set up a boxing ring where people could “challenge” its robots. The robot fighters were about half the size of an adult human and the matches often ended in a robot knockout, but that’s not really the point. What Unitree was actually showing off was its robots’ stability and balance: they got shoved, stumbled across the ring, and stayed upright, recovering mid-motion. Beyond flexing dynamic movements like these there were also impressive showcases of dexterity: Robots could be seen folding paper pinwheels, doing laundry, playing piano, and even making latte art.

However, most of these robots, even the good ones, are one-trick ponies. They’re optimized for a specific task on the show floor. I tried to make one fold a T-shirt after I’d flipped the garment around, and it got confused very quickly.

Still, they’re getting a lot of hype as an  important next frontier because they could help drag AI out of text boxes and into the physical world. As LLMs mature, vision-language models feel like the logical next step. But then you run into the big problem: There’s far less physical-world data than text data to train AI on. Humanoid robots become both applications and roaming data-collection terminals. China is uniquely positioned here because of supply chains, manufacturing depth, and spillover from adjacent industries (EVs, batteries, motors, sensors), and it’s already developing a humanoid training industry, as Rest of World reported recently.

Most Chinese companies believe that if you can manufacture at scale, you can innovate, and they’re not wrong. A lot of the confidence in China’s nascent humanoid robot industry and beyond is less about a single breakthrough and more about “We can iterate faster than the West.”

Chinese companies are not just selling gadgets, though—they’re working on every layer of the tech stack. Not just on end products but frameworks, tooling, IoT enablement, spatial data. Open-source culture feels deeply embedded; engineers from Hangzhou tell me there are AI hackathons every week in the city, where China’s new “little Silicon Valley” is located.

Indeed, the headline innovations at CES 2026 were not on devices but in cloud: platforms, ecosystems, enterprise deployments, and “hybrid AI” (cloud + on-device) applications. Lenovo threw the buzziest main-stage events this year, and yes, there were PCs—but the core story was its cross-device AI agent system, Qira, and a partnership pitch with Nvidia aimed at AI cloud providers. Nvidia’s CEO, Jensen Huang, launched Vera Rubin, a new data-center platform, claiming it would  dramatically lower costs for training and running AI. AMD’s CEO, Lisa Su, introduced Helios, another data-center system built to run huge AI workloads. These solutions point to the ballooning AI computing workload at data centers, and the real race of making cloud services cheap and powerful enough to keep up.

As I spoke with China-related attendees, the overall mood I felt was a cautious optimism. At a house party I went to, VCs and founders from China were mingling effortlessly with Bay Area transplants. Everyone is building something. Almost no one wants to just make money from Chinese consumers anymore. The new default is: Build in China, sell to the world, and treat the US market like the proving ground.

Four ways to think about this year&#39;s reckoning.

They managed to cut the size of the AI reasoning model by more than half—and claim it can now answer politically sensitive questions once off limits in Chinese AI systems.

Our AI writers make their big bets for the coming year—here are five hot trends to watch.

The model is built to detect when crimes are being “contemplated.”

            <h2>Mitigating emissions from air freight: Unlocking the potential of SAF with book and claim</h2>
            <p><strong>MIT Technology Review | 2026-01-12</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2026/01/12/1128939/mitigating-emissions-from-air-freight-unlocking-the-potential-of-saf-with-book-and-claim/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Emissions from air freight have increased by 25% since 2019, according to a 2024 analysis by environmental advocacy organization Stand.Earth.

The researchers found that the expansion of cargo-only fleets to transport goods during the pandemic — as air travel halted, slower freight modes faced disruption, but demand for rapid delivery soared — has led to a yearly increase of almost 20 million tons of carbon dioxide, making up 93.8m tonnes from air freight overall.

And though fleet modernization and operational improvements by freight operators have contributed to ongoing decarbonization efforts, sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) looks set to be instrumental in helping the sector achieve its ambitions to reduce environmental footprint in the long-term.

When used neat, or pure and unblended, SAF can help reduce the life cycle of greenhouse gas emissions from aviation by as much as 80% relative to conventional fuel. It’s why the International Air Transport Association (IATA) estimates that SAF could account for as much as 65% of total reduction of emissions.

For Christoph Wolff, CEO of the Smart Freight Centre, “SAF is the main pathway” to decarbonization across both freight and the wider aviation ecosystem.

“The great thing about SAF is it’s chemically identical to Jet A fuel,” he says. “You can blend it [which means] you have a pathway to ramp it up. You can start small and you can scale it. By scaling it there is the promise or the hope that the price comes down.”

At at least twice the price of conventional jet fuel, cost is a significant barrier hindering broader adoption.

And it isn’t the only one standing between SAF and wider penetration.

Bridging the gap between a concentrated supply of SAF and global demand also remains a major hurdle.

Though the number of verified SAF outlets has increased from fewer than 20 locations in 2021 to 114 as of April 2025, according to sustainability solutions framework 4Air, that accounts for only 92 airports worldwide out of more than 40,000.

“SAF is central to the decarbonization of the aviation sector,” believes Raman Ojha, president of Shell Aviation. “Having said that, adoption and penetration of SAF hasn&#39;t really picked up massively. It&#39;s not due to lack of production capacity, but there are lots of things that are at play. And book and claim in that context helps to bridge that gap.”

Book and claim is a chain of custody model, where the flow of administrative records is not necessarily connected to the physical product through the supply chain (source: ISO 22095:2020).

Book and claim potentially enables airlines and corporations to access the life cycle GHG emissions reduction benefits of SAF relative to conventional jet fuel even when SAF is not physically available at their location; this model helps bridge the gap between that concentrated supply and global demand, until SAF’s availability improves.

“To be bold, without book and claim, no short-term science-based target will be achieved,” says Bettina Paschke, vice president of ESG accounting, reporting and controlling at DHL Express. “Book and claim is essential to achieving science-based targets.”

“SAF production facilities are not everywhere,” she reiterates. “They&#39;re very focused on one location, and if a customer wants to fulfil a mass balance obligation, SAF would need to be shipped around the world just to be at that airport for that customer. That would be very complicated, and very unrealistic.” It would also, counterintuitively, increase total emissions. By using book and claim instead, air freight operators can unlock the life cycle greenhouse gas emissions reduction benefits of SAF relative to conventional jet fuel now, without waiting for supply to broaden. “It might no longer be needed when we have SAF product facilities at each airport in the future,” she points out. “But at the moment, that’s not the case.”

At DHL itself, the mechanism has become central to achieving its own three interconnected sustainability pillars, which focus on decarbonizing logistics supply chains, supporting customers toward their decarbonization goals, and ensuring credible emission claims can be shared along the value chain.

Demonstrating the importance of a credible and viable framework for book and claim systems is also what inspired the 2022 launch of Shell’s Avelia, one of the first blockchain-powered digital SAF book and claim solutions for aviation, which expanded in 2024 to encompass air freight in addition to business travel. Depending on the offering, Avelia offers freight forwarders the opportunity to share the life cycle greenhouse gas emissions reduction benefits of SAF relative to conventional jet fuel across the value chain with shippers using their services.

“It’s also backed by a physical supply chain, which gives our customers — whether those be corporates or freight forwarders or even airlines — a peace of mind that the SAF has been injected at a certain airport, it’s been used and environmental attributes, with the help of blockchain, have been tracked to where they&#39;re getting retired,” says Ojha.

He adds: “The most important or critical part is the transparency that it&#39;s providing to our customers to be sure that they&#39;re not saying something which they can&#39;t confidently stand behind.”

To scale up SAF via book and claim and help make it a more commercially viable lower-carbon solution, its adoption will need to be a coordinated “ecosystem play,” says Wolff. That includes early adopters, such as DHL, inspiring action from peers, solution providers such as Shell, working with various stakeholders to drive joint advocacy, and industry associations, like the Smart Freight Centre creating the required frameworks, educational resources, and industry alignment.

An active book and claim community made up of many forward-thinking advocates is already driving much of this work forward with a common goal to develop greater standardization and consensus, Wolff points out. “It helps to make sure all definitions on the system are compatible and they can talk to one another, provide educational support, and [also that] there’s a repository of transactions so that it can be documented in a way that people can see and think, ‘oh this is how we do it.’ There are some early adopters that are very experienced, but it needs a lot more people for it to get comfortable.”

In early 2024, discussions were held with a diverse group of expert book and claim stakeholders to develop and refine 11 key principles and best practices book and claim models. These represent an aligned set of principles informed by practical successes and challenges faced by practitioners working to decarbonize the heavy transport sector.

Adherence to such a framework is crucial given that book and claim is not yet accepted by the Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Protocol nor the Science Based Targets Initiative (SBTi) as a recognized model for reducing greenhouse gas emissions — though there are hopes that might change.

“The industrialization of book and claim delivery systems is key to credibility and recognition,” says Wolff. “The Greenhouse Gas Protocol and the Science Based Targets Initiative are making steps in recognizing that. There’s a pathway that the Smart Freight Centre is very closely involved in the technical working groups for [looking]to build such a system where, in addition to physical inventory, you also pursue market-based inventories.”

Paschke urges companies not to sit back and wait for policy to change before taking action, though. “The solution is there,” she says. “There are companies like DHL that are making huge upfront investments, and every single contribution helps to scale the industry and give a strong signal to the eco-space.”

As pressure to accelerate decarbonization gains pace, it’s critical that air freight operators consider this now, agrees Ojha. “Don&#39;t wait for perfection in guidelines, regulations, or platforms — act now,” he says. “That’s very, very critical. Second, learn by doing and join hands with others. Don’t try to do everything independently or in-house.

“Third, make use of registries and platforms, such as Avelia, that can give credibility. Join them, utilize them, and leverage them so that you won’t have to establish auditability from scratch.

“And fourth, don’t look at scope book and claim as a means for acquiring a certificate for environmental attributes. Think in terms of your decarbonisation commitment and think of this as a tool for exposure management. Think in terms of the bigger picture.”

That bigger picture being a significant sector-wide push toward faster decarbonization — and turning the tide on emissions’ steep upward ascent.

Introducing this year’s 10 Breakthrough Technologies

It’s easy to be cynical about technology these days. Many of the “disruptions” of the last 15 years were more about coddling a certain set of young, moneyed San Franciscans than improving the world. Yet you can be sympathetic to the techlash and still fully buy into the idea that technology can be good.

We really can build tools that make this planet healthier, more livable, more equitable, and just all-around better. And some people are doing just that, pushing progress forward across a number of fundamental, potentially world-changing technologies.

These are exactly the technologies we aim to spotlight in our annual 10 Breakthrough Technologies list. These are 10 technologies that we believe are poised to fundamentally alter the world, and they’re a matter of hot debate across the newsroom for months before being unveiled. So, without further ado… Here’s the full list.

Do you think we’ve missed something? You have until April to cast your vote for the 11th breakthrough!

—Fabio Duarte is associate director and principal research scientist at the MIT Senseable City Lab.

Today marks the 25th year the MIT Technology Review newsroom has compiled its annual 10 Breakthrough Technologies list, which means its journalists and editors have now identified 250 technologies as breakthroughs.

A few years ago, editor at large David Rotman revisited the publication’s original list, finding that while all the technologies were still relevant, each had evolved and progressed in often unpredictable ways. I lead students through a similar exercise in a graduate class I teach with James Scott for MIT’s School of Architecture and Planning, asking them what we can learn from the failures.

Although it’s less glamorous than envisioning which advances will change our future, analyzing failed technologies is equally important. Read about why that is.

I’ve combed the internet to find you today’s most fun/important/scary/fascinating stories about technology.

This startup is about to conduct the biggest real-world test of aluminum as a zero-carbon fuel

Found Energy aims to harness the energy in scraps of aluminum metal to power industrial processes without fossil fuels. Since 2022, the company has worked to develop ways to rapidly release energy from aluminum on a small scale.

Now it’s just switched on a much larger version of its aluminum-powered engine, which it claims is the largest aluminum-water reactor ever built. Soon, it will be installed to supply heat and hydrogen to a tool manufacturing facility in the southeastern US, using the aluminum waste produced by the plant itself as fuel.

If everything works as planned, this technology, which uses a catalyst to unlock the energy stored within aluminum metal, could transform a growing share of aluminum scrap into a zero-carbon fuel. Read the full story.

            <h2>Securing digital assets as crypto crime surges</h2>
            <p><strong>MIT Technology Review | 2026-01-12</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2026/01/12/1129479/securing-digital-assets-as-crypto-crime-surges/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">In February 2025, cyberattackers thought to be linked to North Korea executed a sophisticated supply chain attack on cryptocurrency exchange Bybit. By targeting its infrastructure and multi-signature security process, hackers managed to steal more than $1.5 billion worth of Ethereum in the largest known digital-asset theft to date.

The ripple effects were felt across the cryptocurrency market, with the price of Bitcoin dropping 20% from its record high in January. And the massive losses put 2025 on track to be the worst year in history for cryptocurrency theft.

Bitcoin, Ethereum, and stablecoins have established themselves as benchmark monetary vehicles, and, despite volatility, their values continue to rise. In October 2025, the value of cryptocurrency and other digital assets topped $4 trillion.

Yet, with this burgeoning value and liquidity comes more attention from cybercriminals and digital thieves. The Bybit attack demonstrates how focused sophisticated attackers are on finding ways to break the security measures that guard the crypto ecosystem, says Charles Guillemet, chief technology officer of Ledger, a provider of secure signer platforms.

”The attackers were very well organized, they have plenty of money, and they are spending a lot of time and resources trying to attack big stuff, because they can,” he says. “In terms of opportunity costs, it&#39;s a big investment, but if at the end they earn $1.4 billion it makes sense to do this investment.”

But it also demonstrates how the crypto threat landscape has pitfalls not just for the unwary but for the tech savvy too. On the one hand, cybercriminals are using techniques like social engineering to target end users. On the other, they are increasingly looking for vulnerabilities to exploit at different points in the cryptocurrency infrastructure.

Historically, owners of digital assets have had to stand against these attackers alone. But now, cybersecurity firms and cryptocurrency-solution providers are offering new solutions, powered by in-depth threat research.

One of the advantages of cryprocurrency is self custody. Users can save their private keys—the critical piece of alphanumeric code that proves ownership and grants full control over digital assets—into either a software or hardware wallet to safeguard it.

But users must put their faith in the security of the wallet technology, and, because the data is the asset, if the keys are lost or forgotten, the value too can be lost.

”If I hack your credit card, what is the issue? You will call your bank, and they will manage to revert the operations,” says Vincent Bouzon, head of the Donjon research team at Ledger. &quot;The problem with crypto is, if something happens, it&#39;s too late. So we must eliminate the possibility of vulnerabilities and give users security.”

Increasingly, attackers are focusing on digital assets known as stablecoins, a form of cryptocurrency that is pegged to the value of a hard asset, such as gold, or a fiat currency, like the US dollar.

Stablecoins rely on smart contracts—digital contracts stored on blockchain that use pre-set code to manage issuance, maintain value, and enforce rules—that can be vulnerable to different classes of attacks, often taking advantage of users&#39; credulity or lack of awareness about the threats. Post-theft countermeasures, such as freezing the transfer of coins and blacklisting of addresses, can lessen the risk with these kinds of attacks, however.

Software-based wallets, also known as “hot wallets,” which are applications or programs that run on a user’s computer, phone, or web browser, are often a weak link. While their connection to the internet makes them convenient for users, it also makes them more readily accessible to hackers too.

“If you are using a software wallet, by design it&#39;s vulnerable because your keys are stored inside your computer or inside your phone. And unfortunately, a phone or a computer is not designed for security.” says Guillemet.

The rewards for exploiting this kind of vulnerability can be extensive. Hackers who stole credentials in a targeted attack on encrypted password manager application LastPass in 2022 managed to transfer millions worth of cryptocurrency away from victims in the subsequent two or more years.

Even hardware-based wallets, which often resemble USB drives or key fobs and are more secure than their software counterparts since they are completely offline, can have vulnerabilities that a diligent attacker might find and exploit.

Tactics include the use of side-channel attacks, for example, where a cycbercriminal observes a system’s physical side effects, like timing, power, or electromagnetic and acoustic emissions to gain information about the implementation of an algorithm.

Guillemet explains that cybersecurity providers building digital asset solutions, such as wallets, need to help minimize the burden on the users by building security features and providing education about enhancing defense.

For businesses to protect cryptocurrency, tokens, critical documents, or other digital assets, this could be a platform that allows multi-stakeholder custody and governance, supports software and hardware protections, and allows for visibility of assets and transactions through Web3 checks.

As the threat landscape evolves at breakneck speed, in-depth research conducted by attack labs like Ledger Donjon can help security firms keep pace. The team at Ledger Donjon are working to understand how to proactively secure the digital asset ecosystem and set global security standards.

Key projects include the team’s offensive security research, which uses ethical and white hat hackers to simulate attacks and uncover weaknesses in hardware wallets, cryptographic systems, and infrastructure.

In November 2022, the Donjon team discovered a vulnerability in Web3 wallet platform Trust Wallet, which had been acquired by Binance. They found that the seed-phrase generation was not random enough, allowing the team to compute all possible private keys and putting as much as $30 million stored in Trust Wallet accounts at risk, says Bouzon. “The entropy was not high enough, the entropy was only 4 billion. It was huge, but not enough,” he says.

To enhance overall safety there are three key principles that digital-asset protection platforms should apply, says Bouzon. First, security providers should create secure algorithms to generate the seed phrases for private keys and conduct in-depth security audits of the software. Second, users should use hardware wallets with a secure screen instead of software wallets. And finally, any smart contract transaction should include visibility into what is being signed to avoid blind signing attacks.

Ultimately, the responsibility for safeguarding these valuable assets lies on both digital asset solution providers and the users themselves. As the value of cryptocurrencies continues to grow so too will the threat landscape as hackers keep attempting to circumvent new security measures. While digital asset providers, security firms, and wallet solutions must work to build strong and simple protection to support the cryptocurrency ecosystems, users must also seek out the information and education they need to proactively protect themselves and their wallets.

            <div id="article-text">Our reporters and editors constantly debate which emerging technologies will define the future. Once a year, we take stock and share some educated guesses with our readers. Here are the advances that we think will drive progress or incite the most change—for better or worse—in the years ahead.

Sodium-ion batteries, made from abundant materials like salt, are emerging as a cheaper, safer alternative to lithium. Backed by major players and public investment, they’re poised to power grids and affordable EVs worldwide.

AI coding tools are revolutionizing how we write, test, and deploy code, making it easier and faster to build sophisticated websites, games, and other applications than ever before. Just be sure to double-check what they come up with.

Nuclear power already provides steady electricity to grids around the world, without producing any greenhouse-gas emissions. New designs rely on alternative fuels and cooling systems or take up less space, which could get more reactors online faster.

From molten salt to TRISO fuel, here’s how technological advancements could upend an old power technology.

Every day, millions of people interact with AI chatbots. Some of them form what feel like close, personal bonds with the bots. There’s mounting evidence that this can be dangerous, and politicians are finally waking up.

When he was just seven months old, baby KJ became the first person to receive a personalized gene-editing treatment. A clinical trial is now planned, and bespoke gene-editing drugs could be approved within the next few years.

Growing banks of gene information on extinct creatures are providing clues to new treatments and suggesting solutions to climate change—and may help save endangered species.

Nobody knows exactly how large language models work, which means we don’t have a clear idea of their limitations. But that’s changing: Clever research techniques are giving us the best glimpse yet of what’s really going on inside the black box.

By studying large language models as if they were living things instead of computer programs, scientists are discovering some of their secrets for the first time.

Space tourism may seem fanciful, but this might be the year paying customers can finally check into a room with a galactic view. The shiny new modules will also support research missions by scientists and space agencies.

Screening embryos for genetic diseases is relatively common practice in fertility clinics today, and it can give potential parents some peace of mind. Now, though, new startups are making bold claims about using similar techniques to predict certain traits, including intelligence.

The race for AI supremacy has supercharged data centers. Hyperscale AI data centers pack powerful computer chips into synchronized clusters that work like giant, high-speed supercomputers—sizzling hot, power-hungry behemoths pushing infrastructure to its limits.

            <div id="article-text">For years, online shopping followed a fixed path. Search bar, product grid, filters, checkout. The interface barely changed, even as everything else on the internet did. That path is now breaking.

Monday 12 January, 2026, JD Sports Fashion plc (JD Group) became one of the first large retailers to let US customers search and buy sneakers directly inside AI chatbots, including ChatGPT, Microsoft Copilot, and Google Gemini. No website visit. No app. Just a conversation that ends with a payment.

Basically, a customer can chat with an AI bot, say “add these shoes to my cart,” and complete a purchase in one click.

JD Sports has agreed a global deal with commercetools to enable “one-click” purchases on AI assistants including Copilot, Gemini and ChatGPT. US customers will simply tell the chatbot what they want and pay instantly via Stripe’s integrated payment flow.

The retailer is the first to deploy commercetools’ “Agentic Jumpstart” solution along with Stripe’s Agentic Commerce Suite (ACS). Stripe handles the payment and fraud protection, while commercetools’ AI Hub keeps JD’s product data, pricing and availability in sync across all AI channels.

For example, “Find me a pair of Nike Air Max size 10.” The AI queries JD’s catalog (via commercetools) and returns relevant products, with images and details. The shopper can then say “buy this pair,” and Stripe handles the checkout seamlessly. Commercetools and Stripe emphasize that all payment and fulfillment data still flow through JD’s systems – the retailer retains control over inventory, pricing, and customer experience.

AI-driven shopping shifts the act of buying from browsing to intent-based conversation.

Instead of scrolling through hundreds of sneakers, a customer can ask for “black running shoes under $150, good for daily training,” refine the request, compare options, and pay, all within the same chat. The AI handles discovery, filtering, and decision support in one flow.

For consumers, that means less friction and less time spent navigating interfaces designed around catalogs, not questions. For retailers, it means the loss of something they’ve relied on for two decades: control over the shopping journey.

JD Sports CEO Regis Schultz compared the impact of AI on retail to the internet boom of the late 1990s and suggested it could shrink physical store footprints by reducing the need for cash desks. The comment points to a wider rethink. If discovery and checkout move into AI layers, both digital and physical stores become less central.

Traditional e-commerce platforms are built around pages, categories, and conversion funnels. AI shopping ignores most of that. When purchases happen inside chatbots, platforms lose visibility into how customers arrive at decisions. Brand differentiation becomes harder when products are presented as answers rather than destinations. Loyalty shifts from websites to whichever AI assistant the customer trusts.

This creates a new competitive layer. Retailers are no longer just competing on price, delivery, or UX, but on how well their inventory, data, and brand translate into AI-mediated conversations. It also raises questions for marketplaces. If AI assistants can compare products across multiple retailers in real time, the advantage of being the “place people go to shop” weakens.

Letting customers buy without visiting a website introduces new risks. Retailers must ensure that payments remain secure, that inventory and pricing are accurate in real time, and that the brand experience doesn’t dissolve into a generic AI response. Stripe’s role here is critical, acting as the trust layer that makes conversational checkout viable at scale.

There’s also the issue of accountability. When something goes wrong, a failed payment, a wrong size, a delayed delivery, the customer interacts with an AI, not a store. Retailers still own the outcome, even if they no longer own the interface.

JD Sports is not alone. The move points to a broader pattern: commerce is migrating upward into AI systems that sit between consumers and brands. As mobile apps reshaped shopping in the 2010s, conversational AI is reshaping it again, this time by pushing the store itself out of the center of the experience.

What replaces it is less visible, but more powerful: intent, context, and conversation. Retail isn’t disappearing. It’s dissolving into the tools people already use to think, search, and decide.

There is something undeniably impressive about this evolution. Buying becomes faster, friction thins, decisions compress into a few lines of text. Yet, step by step, human interaction is quietly being removed from the equation. The cashier, the sales assistant, even the act of browsing alongside others, all fade into background infrastructure.

The open question isn’t whether this shift will happen, but how far it should go. When shopping becomes a dialogue with machines, convenience wins, but presence is lost. Retail now faces a new design challenge, not just how to sell through AI, but how to decide where human interaction still matters, and how to keep it from disappearing by default.

            <div id="article-text">For the past few years, artificial intelligence has been discussed almost exclusively in terms of models. Bigger models, faster models, smarter models. More recently, the focus shifted to agents, systems capable of planning, reasoning, and acting autonomously.

Yet the real leap in usefulness does not happen at the model level, nor at the agent level. It happens one layer above, at the level of Skills.

If models represent intelligence and agents represent coordination, Skills are where AI becomes operational and valuable in the real world.

A Skill is an applied, reusable unit of procedural knowledge that allows an AI system to reliably perform a specific task from start to finish.

In practical terms, a Skill is an intelligent application that transforms user intent into execution.

A Skill has a clearly defined purpose. It encapsulates domain-specific know-how. It follows a repeatable procedure. And it produces a concrete, usable result.

This could mean analyzing a contract and identifying risks, comparing multiple SaaS tools based on real business constraints, generating a pricing strategy using market data, or producing a financial or operational report.

Users never interact with models or agents directly. What they experience are Skills, because Skills are the part of AI that delivers outcomes.

To understand why Skills matter, it helps to look at the modern AI stack. At the foundation are models. They provide raw intelligence such as language understanding, reasoning, perception, and pattern recognition. They are powerful, but fundamentally generic.

Above them sit agents. Agents function like an operating system. They plan tasks, break problems into steps, decide which tools or models to use, and manage execution flow. They are good coordinators, but coordination alone does not equal expertise.

At the top of the stack are Skills. Skills are the application layer. They are structured, purpose-built capabilities that agents can invoke to get real work done. Just as hardware is not software and software is not an application, intelligence is not usefulness. Models are not agents, and agents are not Skills.

A Skill is not a single instruction. It is an orchestrated process. When a user expresses a concrete need, such as wanting to know which SaaS solution best fits their company, the system identifies the relevant Skill. An agent then decomposes the task into procedural steps. Requirements are gathered, data is retrieved, evaluation logic is applied, and results are synthesized. Models perform analysis and reasoning at each step, and the Skill delivers a structured outcome such as a recommendation, report, decision, or document.

From the user’s perspective, none of this complexity is visible. The Skill simply works.

One of the most important distinctions is that Skills encode procedural knowledge rather than descriptive knowledge. Large language models are excellent at explaining what something is. Skills capture how something is actually done.

This procedural knowledge may include workflows, scripts, decision logic, rules, tool integrations, and structured reasoning steps. It is what turns general intelligence into expert behavior. Agents on their own are capable planners, but they lack deep, domain-specific execution knowledge. Skills fill that gap.

This is also why Skills scale better than custom-built agents. A common mistake today is creating a new agent for every task. That approach quickly becomes brittle and unmanageable. Skills, by contrast, are modular, reusable, and composable. A small number of general-purpose agents can call a growing library of specialized Skills, each focused on doing one thing well. This mirrors how scalable software systems are built in practice.

Another critical point is that Skills are products, not just technology. They can be packaged, licensed, distributed, integrated, and monetized. Users and businesses do not buy reasoning or intelligence in the abstract. They buy capabilities. They buy outcomes. They buy the ability to make better decisions and execute faster.

As models become increasingly commoditized and agent frameworks begin to converge, the real competitive advantage in AI is shifting. It will belong to those who build the most useful Skills and control how they are distributed.

In the long run, AI systems will not be judged by how intelligent they are, but by how effectively they convert intelligence into action.

Models think. Agents coordinate. Skills execute.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The term Artificial Intelligence (AI) is well known, often evoking futuristic movies like Robocop, Terminator and The Matrix. Yet what many don’t realize is that AI has been part of our lives for decades.

When you finish watching a movie on a streaming platform and instantly see recommendations for similar content, that’s AI. When you’re shopping online and an entire page of suggested products appears, that’s AI. Even the digital ads you see are powered by machine-learning algorithms designed to optimize engagement, clicks, and conversions.

Companies have relied on AI rule-based automation, routines, and machine-learning algorithms for years to power their systems and business processes.

So when you hear conversations about the “urgent need to start using AI,” pause for a moment. AI itself isn’t new, the real transformation we’re witnessing comes from Generative AI, a newer branch of deep learning, which itself is a subset of machine learning.

A workspace designed for growth, collaboration, and endless networking opportunities in the heart of tech.

Artificial Intelligence broadly covers machines that can perform tasks requiring human-like intelligence. Machine Learning trains systems to learn from data. Deep Learning uses multi-layered neural networks to recognize complex patterns. Generative AI goes one step further. It doesn’t just analyze data or perform tasks, it creates new content: text, images, code, music, and more.

I was among the early adopters of ChatGPT, just a few months after its public launch in late 2022. It was a defining moment in the history of technology, the first time we could produce analyses, insights, and even complete outputs simply by typing natural-language prompts, without programming or complex tools.

I knew immediately that this would change the world. However, this accessibility has created a double-edged sword. Today, the digital landscape is flooded with “AI experts,” unverified tutorials, and get-rich-quick schemes that often promote the misuse of these tools.

There is a vast amount of misinformation circulating, ranging from overhyped capabilities to fundamental misunderstandings of how Large Language Models (LLMs) process truth and data.

To move beyond the noise, it’s important to seek out education from rigorous, academically backed sources rather than social media trends. The goal when using Generative AI tools shouldn’t be just to generate text, but to understand the capabilities and limitations well enough to apply it securely.

I was in university when the Internet first became commercialized. My first job, in 1996, was selling Internet access to individuals and companies. I witnessed firsthand the anxiety, resistance, and eventual transformation that followed. Yes, the Internet eliminated certain jobs, but it created far more, and often better ones.

Generative AI is bringing a similar paradigm shift today. The key is not to fear it but to learn it, to develop the literacy and critical understanding to use it responsibly. A sentiment often shared among industry leaders during my Generative AI research has stayed with me ever since: “AI will not steal your job; a human using AI will.”

That sentence should be a constant reminder for everyone: life is an ongoing evolution. Technologies disrupt, jobs disappear, and new ones emerge. So the next time you hear someone say, “We need to get into AI,” ask, “Which AI?”

Traditional AI analyzes what already exists, and chances are, you and your company are already using it. Generative AI creates what’s next. This distinction matters. If you treat Generative AI like a search engine or a calculator, you miss its true potential. If you treat it as an absolute source of truth, you risk misuse.

That is why deep literacy is essential. Understanding the specific capabilities of these tools is an act of digital responsibility. By educating ourselves, grounding our knowledge in fact, and embracing change with intention, we prepare to lead this next technological era, not be replaced by it.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">This is one of the most concerning questions for sales teams at the beginning of 2026: are tech giants killing cold outreach? The answer is that we do not know yet, but here is a perspective from someone working in sales.

Apple and Google have recently introduced two features that show a clear tendency toward the decline of cold outreach.

Apple’s new feature, “Ask Reason for Calling,” is a game changer. It effectively turns cold calling into another form of messaging. No more dynamism, no element of surprise, no offhandedness. Human touch is at the core of sales, but how can that element still exist if interaction is reduced to reading a few short phrases?

The magic of cold calling was always the surprise factor. No expectations for the person answering, no prior knowledge of who is calling or what the subject is, and no immediate cues such as where the caller is from, their accent, or how they pitch.

Does this feature mean that all the books and courses salespeople take to understand psychology, master tone, and capture attention are becoming worthless?

Google has announced a new AI inbox tool that offers personalized summaries of received emails and to-do items. What does this mean? As soon as a decision-maker notices that you are trying to sell something out of the blue, your email may be ignored, deleted, or your sequence may receive the old-fashioned “unsubscribe.”

This feature is not surprising, as Google has been tightening regulations around bulk and cold emails for some time. However, these measures have pushed salespeople toward increasingly extreme tactics, redefining what “off the wall” really means.

At this point, B2B email, Gmail, and LinkedIn are starting to resemble Instagram, TikTok, and WhatsApp. Less focus, less quality content, less valuable information, and more distraction.

While many people, especially decision-makers, blame salespeople for damaging the business landscape, particularly in terms of trust and distraction, and while endless tirades against cold calling and cold emailing continue on LinkedIn, sales and outreach remain fundamental to building a company.

All of us have something valuable to say and worth listening to, regardless of our role or the company we belong to. Time is indeed the most valuable resource, but taking a five-minute call or reading a three-minute email is not an eternity. It can offer more value than expected and open new opportunities.

In a world increasingly driven by AI, with clear shifts across all business sectors, human touch remains at the foundation of every company. Networking, meeting new people, and sharing ideas are the pillars of business.

So, are tech giants really killing cold outreach? Time will tell. For now, the answer is no.

            <h2>ChatGPT Health has arrived</h2>
            <p><strong>The Next Web | 2026-01-08</strong></p>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">I’ve said this many times: the products we see on the market are rarely visionary leaps. Most of the time, they are mirrors. They reflect people’s habits, shortcuts, fears, and small daily behaviours. Design follows behaviour. Always has.

Think about it. You probably know at least one person who already uses ChatGPT for health-related questions. Not occasionally. Regularly. As a second opinion. As a place to test concerns before saying them out loud. Sometimes even as a therapist, a confidant, or a space where embarrassment does not exist.

When habits become consistent, companies stop observing and start building. At that point, users are no longer just customers. They are co-architects. Their behaviour quietly shapes the product roadmap.

That context matters when looking at what OpenAI announced on January 7, 2026: the launch of ChatGPT Health, a dedicated AI-powered experience focused on healthcare. OpenAI describes it as “a dedicated experience that securely brings your health information and ChatGPT’s intelligence together.”

The latest rumblings from the EU tech scene, a story from our wise ol&#39; founder Boris, and some questionable AI art. It&#39;s free, every week, in your inbox. Sign up now!

Access is limited for now. The company is rolling it out through a waitlist, with gradual expansion planned over the coming weeks. Anyone with a ChatGPT account, Free or paid, can sign up for early access, except users in the European Union, the UK, and Switzerland, where regulatory alignment is still pending.

The stated goal is simple on paper: help people feel more informed, more prepared, and more confident when managing their health. But the numbers behind that decision say more than the press language ever could. According to OpenAI, over 230 million people worldwide already ask health or wellness questions on ChatGPT every week.

That figure raises uncomfortable questions.

Why do so many people turn to an AI for health questions? Is it speed? The promise of an immediate answer? The way our expectations have shifted toward instant clarity, even for complex or sensitive issues? Is it discomfort, the reluctance to speak openly with a doctor about certain topics? Or something deeper, a quiet erosion of trust in human systems, paired with a growing confidence in machines that do not judge, interrupt, or rush?

ChatGPT Health does not answer those questions. It simply formalises the behaviour.

According to OpenAI, the new Health space allows users to securely connect personal health data, including medical records, lab results, and information from fitness or wellness apps. Someone might upload recent blood test results and ask for a summary. Another might connect a step counter and ask how their activity compares to previous months.

The system can integrate data from platforms such as Apple Health, MyFitnessPal, Peloton, AllTrails, and even grocery data from Instacart. The promise is contextual responses, not generic advice. Lab results explained in plain language. Patterns highlighted over time. Suggestions for questions to ask during a medical appointment. Diet or exercise ideas grounded in what the data actually shows.

What ChatGPT Health is careful not to do matters just as much as what it can do.

OpenAI is explicit: this is not medical advice. It does not diagnose conditions. It does not prescribe treatments. It is designed to support care, not replace it. The framing is intentional. ChatGPT Health positions itself as an assistant, not an authority. A tool for understanding patterns and preparing conversations, not making decisions in isolation.

That distinction is crucial. And, frankly, it is one I hope users take seriously.

Behind the scenes, OpenAI says the system was developed with extensive medical oversight. Over the past two years, more than 260 physicians from roughly 60 countries reviewed responses and provided feedback, contributing over 600,000 individual evaluation points. The focus was not only accuracy, but tone, clarity, and when the system should clearly encourage users to seek professional care.

To support that process, OpenAI built an internal evaluation framework called HealthBench. It scores responses based on clinician-defined standards, including safety, medical correctness, and appropriateness of guidance. It is an attempt to bring structure to a domain where nuance matters and mistakes carry weight.

Privacy is another pillar OpenAI insists on emphasising. ChatGPT Health operates in a separate, isolated environment within the app. Health-related conversations, connected data sources, and uploaded files are kept entirely separate from regular chats. Health data does not flow into the general ChatGPT memory, and conversations in this space are encrypted.

OpenAI also states that health conversations are not used to train its core models. Whether that assurance will be enough for all users remains to be seen, but the architectural separation signals an awareness of how sensitive this territory is.

In the United States, the system goes a step further. Through a partnership with b.well Connected Health, ChatGPT Health can access real electronic health records from thousands of providers, with user permission. This allows it to summarise official lab reports or condense long medical histories into readable overviews. Outside the US, functionality is more limited, largely due to regulatory differences.

There are potential downstream effects for healthcare providers as well. If patients arrive at appointments already familiar with their data, already aware of trends, already prepared with focused questions, consultations could become more efficient. Less time decoding numbers. More time discussing decisions.

And inevitably, the question surfaces: should doctors be worried?

AI is not a medical professional. It does not examine patients. It does not carry legal responsibility. It cannot replace clinical judgement, experience, or accountability. ChatGPT Health does not change that. It is not a shortcut to self-diagnosis, and it should not be treated as one.

What it does change is the starting point of the conversation.

Used responsibly, ChatGPT Health can help people engage with their own health information instead of avoiding it. Misused, it could reinforce false certainty or delay necessary care. The responsibility, as always, is shared between the tool and the person using it.

Users should stay aware of privacy implications, seek professional advice when it matters, and treat AI guidance as one input among many, not a final answer.

One thing is clear, though. 2026 did not arrive quietly.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The AI industry has become adept at measuring itself. Benchmarks improve, model scores rise, and every new release arrives with a list of metrics meant to signal progress. And yet, somewhere between the lab and real life, something keeps slipping.

Which model actually feels better to use?
Which answers would a human trust?
Which system would you put in front of customers, employees, or citizens and feel comfortable standing behind it?

That gap is where LMArena has quietly built its business, and why investors just put $150 million behind it at a $1.7 billion valuation, in a Series A round. The lead investors were Felicis and UC Investments, with participation from major venture firms (Andreessen Horowitz, Kleiner Perkins, Lightspeed, The House Fund, Laude Ventures).

For years, benchmarks were the currency of AI credibility: accuracy scores, reasoning tests and standardized datasets. They worked until they didn’t. As models grew larger and more similar, benchmark improvements became marginal. Worse, models began to optimize for the tests themselves rather than real use cases. Static evaluations struggled to reflect how AI behaves in open-ended, messy human interactions.

At the same time, AI systems moved out of labs and into everyday workflows: drafting emails, writing code, powering customer support, assisting with research and advising professionals. The question shifted from “Can the model do this?” to “Should we trust it when it does?”

That’s a different kind of measurement problem.

LMArena’s answer was simple and radical: stop scoring models in isolation. On its platform, users submit a prompt and receive two anonymized responses. No branding. No model names. Just answers. Then the user picks the better one, or neither.

One vote. One comparison. Repeated millions of times.

The result isn’t a definitive “best,” but a living signal of human preference , how people respond to tone, clarity, verbosity and real-world usefulness. When the prompt isn’t clean or predictable, that signal changes. And it captures something benchmarks often miss.

LMArena isn’t about whether a model produces a factually correct answer. It’s about whether humans prefer it when it does. That distinction is subtle but meaningful in practice. Rankings on the Arena leaderboard are now referenced by developers and labs before releases and product decisions. Major models from OpenAI, Google and Anthropic are regularly evaluated there.

Without traditional marketing, LMArena became a mirror the industry watches.

The $150 million round isn’t just a vote of confidence in LMArena’s product. It signals that AI evaluation itself is becoming infrastructure. As the number of models explodes, enterprise buyers face a new question: not how to get AI, but which AI to trust. Vendor claims and classical benchmarks don’t always translate to real-world reliability. Internal testing is expensive and slow.

A neutral, third-party signal, something that sits between model builders and users  is emerging as a critical layer. That’s where LMArena lives. In September 2025, it launched AI Evaluations, a commercial service that turns its crowdsourced comparison engine into a product enterprises and labs can pay to access. LMArena says this service achieved an annualized run rate of about $30 million within months of launch.

For regulators and policymakers, this kind of human-anchored signal matters too. Oversight frameworks need evidence that reflects real usage, not idealized scenarios.

LMArena’s approach isn’t without debate. Platforms that rely on public voting and crowdsourced signals can reflect the preferences of active users, which may not align with the needs of specific professional domains. In response, competitors like Scale AI’s SEAL Showdown have emerged, aiming to offer more granular, representative model rankings across languages, regions and professional contexts.

Academic research also notes that voting-based leaderboards can be susceptible to manipulation if safeguards aren’t in place, and that such systems may favor superficially appealing responses over technically correct ones if quality control isn’t rigorous.

These debates highlight that no single evaluation method captures every dimension of model behavior, but they also underscore the demand for richer, human-grounded signals beyond traditional benchmarks.

There’s a quiet assumption in AI that trust will emerge naturally as models improve. Better reasoning, so the logic goes, will lead to better outcomes. That framing treats alignment as a technical problem with technical solutions.

LMArena challenges that idea. Trust, in real contexts, is social and contextual. It’s built through experience, not claims. It’s shaped by feedback loops that don’t collapse under scale. By letting users, not companies, decide what works, LMArena introduces friction where the industry often prefers momentum. It slows things down just enough to ask, “Is this actually better, or just newer?”

That’s an uncomfortable question in a market driven by constant release cycles. It’s also why LMArena’s rise feels inevitable.

LMArena doesn’t promise safety. It doesn’t declare models good or bad. It doesn’t replace regulation or responsibility. What it does is simpler and more powerful: it keeps score in public. As AI systems become embedded in everyday decisions, tracking performance over time becomes less optional. Someone has to notice regressions, contextual shifts and usability patterns.

In sports, referees and statisticians fill this role. In markets, auditors and rating agencies do. In AI, we’re still inventing that infrastructure.

LMArena’s funding round suggests investors believe this role won’t stay marginal for long. Because when AI is everywhere, the hardest questions aren’t what it can do. They are who we trust when it does it, and how we know we’re right.
