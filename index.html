            <h2>TSMC says AI demand is “endless” after record Q4 earnings</h2>
            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-01-16</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2026/01/tsmc-says-ai-demand-is-endless-after-record-q4-earnings/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">On Thursday, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) reported record fourth-quarter earnings and said it expects AI chip demand to continue for years. During an earnings call, CEO C.C. Wei told investors that while he cannot predict the semiconductor industry’s long-term trajectory, he remains bullish on AI.

TSMC manufactures chips for companies including Apple, Nvidia, AMD, and Qualcomm, making it a linchpin of the global electronics supply chain. The company produces the vast majority of the world’s most advanced semiconductors, and its factories in Taiwan have become a focal point of US-China tensions over technology and trade. When TSMC reports strong demand and ramps up spending, it signals that the companies designing AI chips expect years of continued growth.

“All in all, I believe in my point of view, the AI is real—not only real, it’s starting to grow into our daily life. And we believe that is kind of—we call it AI megatrend, we certainly would believe that,” Wei said during the call. “So another question is ‘can the semiconductor industry be good for three, four, five years in a row?’ I’ll tell you the truth, I don’t know. But I look at the AI, it looks like it’s going to be like an endless—I mean, that for many years to come.”

TSMC posted net income of NT$505.7 billion (about $16 billion) for the quarter, up 35 percent year over year and above analyst expectations. Revenue hit $33.7 billion, a 25.5 percent increase from the same period last year. The company expects nearly 30 percent revenue growth in 2026 and plans to spend between $52 billion and $56 billion on capital expenditures this year, up from $40.9 billion in 2025.

Wei’s optimism stands in contrast to months of speculation about whether the AI industry is in a bubble. In November, Google CEO Sundar Pichai warned of “irrationality” in the AI market and said no company would be immune if a potential bubble bursts. OpenAI’s Sam Altman acknowledged in August that investors are “overexcited” and that “someone” will lose a “phenomenal amount of money.”

But TSMC, which manufactures the chips that power the AI boom, is betting the opposite way, with Wei telling analysts he spoke directly to cloud providers to verify that demand is real before committing to the spending increase.

“I want to make sure that my customers’ demand are real. So I talked to those cloud service providers, all of them,” Wei said. “The answer is that I’m quite satisfied with the answer. Actually, they show me the evidence that the AI really helps their business.”

The earnings report landed the same day the US and Taiwan finalized a trade agreement that cuts tariffs on Taiwanese goods to 15 percent, down from 20 percent. The deal commits Taiwanese companies to $250 billion in direct US investment, and TSMC is accelerating the expansion of its Arizona chip fabrication facilities to match.</div>

            <h2>Feds give Tesla another five weeks to respond to FSD probe</h2>
            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-01-16</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2026/01/feds-give-tesla-another-five-weeks-to-respond-to-fsd-probe/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Late last year, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration opened yet another investigation into Tesla and its partially automated driver assist systems. This time it was about FSD (again), which has been the subject of more than 60 complaints to the regulator after Teslas operating under FSD either ignored red traffic lights or crossed into oncoming traffic. As part of the preliminary investigation, NHTSA’s Office of Defects Investigation has asked Tesla for more information on the problem. This week, it told the automaker it could have a five-week extension on its homework.

To be fair to Tesla, NHTSA has asked for a comprehensive amount of information: a list of every Tesla produced and sold or leased in the United States, including whether or not that car had FSD and which version; cumulative data on how many US Teslas have FSD and how often it’s used; and a list of all the customer complaints, field reports, incident reports, lawsuits, and other data related to FSD ignoring traffic laws.

For each incident involving a crash, Tesla must give NHTSA a summary of the incident, including “causal and contributing factors.” Further questions require information on FSD use by crashed cars; any alert shown to the drivers; what work, simulation, or otherwise Tesla has conducted to ameliorate the problem; any modifications or changes to FSD hardware or software; an explanation of Tesla’s theory of operation for traffic lights and stop signs; and Tesla’s assessment of the problem.

The original request was sent to Tesla on December 3 with a deadline of January 19—next Monday—with penalties of up to $27,874 per day (to a maximum of $139.4 million) for not complying.

However, the winter holiday period ate up two weeks of the six-and-a-bit weeks, and the company has had to simultaneously prepare two other information requests for other ongoing NHTSA probes, one due today, another on January 23rd, and yet another on February 4, the company told NHTSA. Identifying all the complaints and reports will take more time, Tesla said, as it found 8,313 items when it searched for traffic violations, and it can only process 300 a day to see which ones are relevant.

Answering the remaining questions on NHTSA’s list would require the above to be completed first, so Tesla asked for and was granted an extension until February 23.

Meanwhile, Tesla has changed how its driver assist cash cow contributes to the bottom line. Until now, Tesla owners had the option of buying the system outright for (currently) $8,000. Now, CEO Elon Musk says that option will go away on February 14. From then on, if a Tesla owner wants FSD, they’ll have to pay a $99 monthly fee to use it.</div>

            <h2>Ferrari doing what it does best: The 12Cilindri review</h2>
            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-01-16</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2026/01/driven-the-ferrari-12cilindri-spider-is-open-top-grand-touring-bliss/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">It has been nearly 80 years since Ferrari unleashed its first V12-powered sports car upon the world with the 125 S. In 1947, its debut year, the 125 S secured Ferrari’s first race victory, along with five other wins in the 14 events it competed in that season.

Although it was soon replaced by the 159 S, the success of the 125 S kick-started Ferrari’s storied history of producing some of the most desirable 12-cylinder performance cars known to man. And while the Italian automaker has come to embrace forced induction and electrification in recent years, its legacy of building stunning front-engine, rear-wheel drive machines with spectacular V12s stuffed into their engine bays continues with the 12Cilindri Spider.

Ferrari hasn’t shied away from leveraging cutting-edge technology in the development of its latest models, but the company also understands the value of a good throwback. As the successor to the 812 Superfast, the 12Cilindri boasts clever performance technologies, like a sophisticated active aero system and a four-wheel steering system that can manage each corner independently to enhance response, but it’s ultimately an homage to the heady days of late ’60s luxury grand touring. The exterior styling takes obvious inspiration from the 365 GTB Daytona, while its lack of all-wheel drive, turbocharging, and electric assistance bucks trends that have become nearly inescapable in modern performance cars.

Instead, Ferrari has deliberately prioritized the core principles that have defined its most enduring GT icons: elegant design, a meticulously engineered chassis, and a sensational naturally aspirated V12, the latter represented here by a 6.5 L dry-sump mill that delivers 819 hp (611 kW) and a soaring 9,500-rpm redline.

That horsepower figure might not raise as many eyebrows as it would have just a few years ago, but it’s worth noting that at a time in history when an alarming number of new performance vehicles are now as heavy as full-size pickups, the 12Cilindri Spider tips the scales at a relatively svelte dry weight of 3,571 (1,620 kg) pounds thanks in part to its focus on the fundamentals. Equipped with massage seats and a retractable hardtop that opens and closes in just 14 seconds, the 12Cilindri Spider is primarily aimed at fulfilling drivers’ fantasies of cruising along the French Riviera with the smell of the ocean in the air and the banshee wail of 12 cylinders in their ears. But it also takes on a noticeably more sportscar-like persona than its primary rival, the Aston Martin Vanquish Volante, mainly due to the 12Cilindri’s eight-speed dual-clutch transmission and more earnest performance-tuned chassis.

Sport is the 12Cilindri Spider’s default drive mode, a naming decision that helps set expectations for suspension stiffness, but you can also depress the steering-wheel-mounted Manettino drive mode dial to enable Bumpy Road mode, which softens the adaptive dampers beyond their standard tuning for more compliance on rough pavement. While the gearbox occasionally needs a second to get its act together from a standstill, and the car’s low stance makes the nose lift system an often-used feature, the 12Cilindri Spider is a remarkably civil cruiser when pressed into service for everyday driving tasks.

The in-car tech does tarnish this driving experience to a tangible degree, though. The liberal use of capacitive surfaces on the steering wheel and the instrument panel to control features like rear-view mirror position and adaptive cruise control, as well as the functions that are accessed via the 15.6-inch digital gauge cluster, frequently led to frustration during my time with the car, and although the high-resolution 10.25-inch central touchscreen looks great and is quick to respond to user inputs, wireless Apple CarPlay crashed on several occasions for no discernible reason and remained inaccessible until after the next key cycle. These may seem like trivial issues, but in a car with a $507,394 MSRP ($661,364 as-tested with destination fee), it’s tough to excuse problems that are so distracting and seemingly easy to rectify.

We had the same problem with the 296 GTB, and it’s time Ferrari retired its capacitive wheel and replaced them all with the version that has physical buttons. Which it will do for existing owners—for a hefty fee.

But, perhaps unsurprisingly, those quibbles always seemed to fade away whenever I found an open stretch of canyon road and set the Manettino to Race mode. Doing so eases up the electronic assists, sets up the transmission and differential for sharper response, and opens up the valves in the active exhaust system. But, in contrast to convention, it leaves the steering weight, suspension stiffness, throttle response, and brake-by-wire system alone in order to maintain predictable dynamic behavior regardless of which drive mode you’re in.

Although the exhaust is a bit quieter than I’d prefer, even with the roof stowed away, the sound that this V12 makes as you wind it out is the stuff that dreams are made of. It took me a moment to recalibrate to the lofty redline, though—with the gearbox set to manual mode, my mind naturally wanted to pull the column-mounted paddle about 2,000 rpm early. I blame this on my seat time in the Vanquish coupe last year. Aston’s decision to equip the Vanquish’s 5.2 L V12 with a pair of turbochargers enables it to best the 12Cilinidri’s horsepower figure by a few ponies while also providing a significant advantage in peak torque output (738 lb-ft/1,000 Nm versus the Ferrari’s 500 lb-ft/678 Nm), but it also relegates the Vanquish’s redline to a more prosaic 7,000 rpm while naturally muting its tone a bit.

And to be frank, I don’t think the 12Cilindri Spider needs another 238 lb-ft (322 Nm), a theory that was backed by the flashing traction control light that fired up any time I got a little too brave with the throttle coming out of a slow corner. Intervention from the Ferrari’s electronic safeguards is so seamless that I rarely noticed it happening at all, though, and I can’t say the same for the Vanquish, which is undoubtedly thrilling to drive but often felt like it was fighting against its own prodigious output in order to keep the nose on the intended path. The 12Cilindri, by contrast, feels easy to trust when the going gets fast, and that sensation is bolstered by tons of mechanical grip, a quick steering rack, and a firm, progressive brake pedal.

But regardless of my thoughts on the matter, the 12Cilindri’s successor will likely be a significantly different beast with a lot more power on tap. Nearly a decade ago, we predicted that the 812 would likely be the last Ferrari to feature a naturally aspirated V12, and while this is a prediction that we’re happy to have been wrong about, this era is undoubtedly drawing to a close. A hybridized V12 will likely offer even more grunt, and enthusiasts rarely scoff at the prospect of more power, but it also opens the door to all-wheel drive, significantly more heft, and ultimately a very different driving experience. Until then, the 12Cilindri Spider serves as an important reminder that sometimes the most compelling aspects of a performance car can’t be quantified on a spec sheet.</div>

            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-01-16</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2026/01/mother-of-one-of-elon-musks-offspring-sues-xai-over-sexualized-deepfakes/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Ashley St Clair, the influencer and mother of one of Elon Musk’s children, has sued the billionaire’s AI company, accusing its Grok chatbot of creating fake sexual imagery of her without her consent.

In the lawsuit, filed in New York state court, St Clair alleged that xAI’s Grok first created an AI-generated or altered image of her in a bikini earlier this month.

St Clair claims she made a request to xAI that no further such images be made, but nevertheless “countless sexually abusive, intimate, and degrading deepfake content of St. Clair [were] produced and distributed publicly by Grok.”

In one case, a photo of St Clair from when she was 14 years old was altered by Grok to undress her and put her in a bikini, according to the court filing.

St Clair is a conservative influencer with about 1 million followers on X and the mother of one of Musk’s children. The billionaire entrepreneur has espoused pronatalist views, arguing in support of increasing birth rates, and has fathered at least 14 children with several different women.

After reporting the images to xAI, St Clair’s account on the X social media platform was stripped of its verification checkmark, premium subscription, and ability to monetize her posts, the filing said.

The case has now been moved to federal court. xAI, which runs X, did not respond to a request for comment.

The news comes as xAI and Musk have come under fire over fake sexualized images of women and children, which proliferated on the platform this year, particularly after Musk jokingly shared an AI-altered post of himself in a bikini.

Over the past week, the issue has prompted threats of fines and bans in the EU, UK, and France, as well as investigations by the California attorney-general and Britain’s Ofcom regulator. Grok has also been banned in Indonesia and Malaysia.

On Wednesday, xAI took action to restrict the image-generation function on its Grok AI model to block the chatbot from undressing users, insisting that it removed Child Sexual Abuse Material (CSAM) and non-consensual nudity material.

St Clair, who has in recent months been increasingly critical of Musk, is also seeking a temporary restraining order to prevent xAI from generating images that undress her.

“Ms St Clair is humiliated, depressed, fearful for her life, angry and desperately in need of action from this court to protect her against xAI’s facilitation of this unfathomable nightmare,” lawyers wrote in a filing seeking the restraining order.

xAI filed a lawsuit against St Clair in Texas on Thursday, claiming she had breached the company’s terms of service by bringing her lawsuit against the company in a New York court instead of in Texas.

Earlier this week, Musk also said on X that he would be filing for “full custody” of their 1-year-old son Romulus, after St Clair apologized for sharing posts critical of transgender people in the past. Musk, who has a transgender child, has repeatedly been critical of transgender people and the rights of trans individuals.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Welcome to Edition 8.25 of the Rocket Report! All eyes are on Florida this weekend as NASA rolls out the Space Launch System rocket and Orion spacecraft to its launch site in Florida for the Artemis II mission. NASA has not announced a launch date yet, and this will depend in part on how well a “wet dress rehearsal” goes with fueling the rocket. However, it is likely the rocket has a no-earlier-than launch date of February 8. Our own Stephen Clark will be in Florida for the rollout on Saturday, so be sure and check back here for coverage.

As always, we welcome reader submissions, and if you don’t want to miss an issue, please subscribe using the box below (the form will not appear on AMP-enabled versions of the site). Each report will include information on small-, medium-, and heavy-lift rockets as well as a quick look ahead at the next three launches on the calendar.

MaiaSpace scores a major launch deal. The ArianeGroup subsidiary, created in 2022, has inked a major new launch contract with satellite operator Eutelsat, Le Monde reports. A significant portion of the 440 new satellites ordered by Eutelsat from Airbus to renew or expand its OneWeb constellation will be launched into orbit by the new Maia rocket. MaiaSpace previously signed two contracts: one with Exotrail for the launch of an orbital transfer, and the other for two satellites for the Toutatis mission, a defense system developed by U-Space.

A big win for the French firm … The first test launch of Maia is scheduled for the end of 2026, a year later than initially planned, at the Guiana Space Centre in French Guiana. The first flights carrying OneWeb satellites are therefore likely to launch no earlier than 2027. Powered by liquid oxygen-methane propellant, Maia aims to be able to deliver up to 500 kg to low-Earth orbit when the first stage is recovered, and 1,500 kg when fully expendable.

Firefly announces Alpha upgrade plan. Firefly Aerospace said this week it was planning a “Block II” upgrade to its Alpha rocket that will “focus on enhancing reliability, streamlining producibility, and improving launch operations to further support commercial, civil, and national security mission demand.” Firefly’s upcoming Alpha Flight 7, targeted to launch in the coming weeks, will be the last flown in the current configuration and will serve as a test flight with multiple Block II subsystems in shadow mode.

Too many failures … “Firefly worked closely with customers and incorporated data and lessons learned from our first six Alpha launches and hundreds of hardware tests to make upgrades that increase reliability and manufacturability with consolidated parts, key configuration updates, and stronger structures built with automated machinery,” said Jason Kim, CEO of Firefly Aerospace. Speaking bluntly, reliability upgrades are needed. Of Alpha’s six launches to date, only two have been a complete success. (submitted by TFargo04)

Another PSLV launch failure. India’s first launch of 2026 ended in failure due to an issue with the third stage of its Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV), Spaceflight Now reports. The mission, designated PSLV-C62, was also the second consecutive failure of this four-stage rocket, with both anomalies affecting the third stage. This time, 16 satellites were lost, including those of other nations. ISRO said it initiated a “detailed analysis” to determine the root cause of the anomaly.

Has been India’s workhorse rocket … The four-stage launch vehicle is a mixture of solid- and liquid- fueled stages. Both the first and third stages are solid-fueled, while the second and fourth stages are powered by liquid propulsion. The PSLV Rocket has flown in multiple configurations since it debuted in September 1993 and achieved 58 fully successful launches, with the payloads on those missions reaching their intended orbit.

US military invests in L3Harris rocket motors. The US government will invest $1 billion in L3Harris Technologies’ growing rocket motor business, guaranteeing a steady supply of the much-needed motors used in a wide range of ‍missiles such as Tomahawks and Patriot interceptors, CNBC reports. L3Harris said on Tuesday it ‌is planning ‌an IPO of its growing rocket motor business into a new publicly ​traded company backed by a $1 billion government convertible security investment. The securities will automatically convert to common equity when the company goes public later in 2026.

Shifting investment strategy … “We are fundamentally shifting our approach to securing our munitions supply chain,” said Michael Duffey, undersecretary of defense for acquisition and sustainment. “By investing directly in suppliers we are building the resilient industrial ⁠base needed for the Arsenal of Freedom.” However, the government’s equity position in L3Harris could face blowback from L3Harris’ rivals, given that it creates a potentially significant conflict of interest for the US government. The Pentagon will have an ownership stake in a company that regularly bids on major defense and other government contracts.

First Ariane 64 to launch next month. Arianespace announced Thursday that it plans to launch the first variant of the Ariane 6 rocket with four solid rocket boosters on February 12 from French Guiana. The mission will also be the company’s first launch of Amazon Leo (formerly Project Kuiper) satellites. This is the first of 18 Ariane 6 launches that Arianespace sold to Amazon for the broadband communications megaconstellation.

A growing cadence … The Ariane 6 rocket has launched five times, including its debut flight in July 2024. All of the launches were a success, although the first flight failed to relight the upper stage in order to make a controlled reentry. Arianespace increased the cadence to four launches last year and will seek to try to double that this year.

Falcon 9 launches the Pandora mission. NASA’s Pandora satellite rocketed into orbit early Sunday from Vandenberg Space Force Base, California, Ars reports. It hitched a ride with around 40 other small payloads aboard a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket, launching into a polar Sun-synchronous orbit before deploying at an altitude of roughly 380 miles (613 kilometers).

A satellite that can carry a tune … Pandora will augment the capabilities of NASA’s James Webb Space Telescope. Over the next few weeks, ground controllers will put Pandora through a series of commissioning and calibration steps before turning its eyes toward deep space. From low-Earth orbit, Pandora will observe exoplanets and their stars simultaneously, allowing astronomers to correct their measurements of the planet’s atmospheric composition and structure based on the ever-changing conditions of the host star itself.

ArianeGroup seeking ideas for Ariane 6 reuse. In this week’s newsletter, we’ve already had a story about MaiaSpace and another item about the Ariane 6 rocket. So why not combine the two and also have a report about an Ariane 6 mashup with the Maia rocket? As it turns out, there’s a relatively new proposal to retrofit the existing Ariane 6 rocket design for partial reuse with Maia rockets as side boosters, Ars reports.

Sir, maia I have some cost savings? … It’s infeasible to recover the Ariane 6’s core stage for many reasons. Chief among them is that the main stage burns for more than seven minutes on an Ariane 6 flight, reaching speeds about twice as fast as SpaceX’s Falcon 9 booster achieves during its two-and-a-half minutes of operation during launch. Swapping out Ariane 6’s solid rocket motors for reusable liquid boosters makes some economic sense for ArianeGroup. The proposal would bring the development and production of the boosters under full control of ArianeGroup and its French subsidiary, cutting Italy’s solid rocket motor developer, Avio, out of the program. All the same, we’ll believe this when we see it.

Meet the EtherealX Razor Crest Mk-1. I learned that there is a rocket company founded in Bengaluru, India, named Ethereal Exploration Guild, or EtherealX. (Did you see what they did there?) I found this out because the company announced (via email) that it had raised an oversubscribed $20.5 million Series A round led by TDK Ventures and BIG Capital. So naturally, I went to the EtherealX website looking for more information.

Let me say, I was not disappointed … As you might expect from a company named EtherealX, its proposed rocket has nine engines, is powered by liquid oxygen and kerosene, and has a maximum capacity of 24.8 metric tons to low-Earth orbit. (Did you see what they did there?) The website does not include much information, but there is this banger of a statement: “The EtherealX Razor Crest Mk-1 will house 9 of the most powerful operational liquid rocket engines in Asia, Europe, Australia, Africa, South America, and Antarctica – Stallion.” And let’s be honest, when you’ve bested Antarctica in engine development, you know you’re cooking. Alas, what I did not see on the website was much evidence of real hardware.

NASA topples historic Saturn and shuttle infrastructure. Two historic NASA test facilities used in the development of the Saturn V and space shuttle launch vehicles have been demolished after towering over the Marshall Space Flight Center in Alabama since the start of the Space Age, Ars reports. The Propulsion and Structural Test Facility, which was erected in 1957—the same year the first artificial satellite entered Earth orbit—and the Dynamic Test Facility, which has stood since 1964, were brought down by a coordinated series of implosions on Saturday, January 10.

Out with the old, in with the new … Located in Marshall’s East Test Area on the US Army’s Redstone Arsenal in Huntsville, the two structures were no longer in use and, according to NASA, had a backlog of $25 million in needed repairs. “This work reflects smart stewardship of taxpayer resources,” Jared Isaacman, NASA administrator, said in a statement. “Clearing outdated infrastructure allows NASA to safely modernize, streamline operations and fully leverage the infrastructure investments signed into law by President Trump to keep Marshall positioned at the forefront of aerospace innovation.”

Space Force swaps Vulcan for Falcon 9. The next Global Positioning System satellite is switching from a United Launch Alliance Vulcan rocket to a SpaceX Falcon 9, a spokesperson for the US Space Force Space Systems Command System Delta 80 said Tuesday, Spaceflight Now reports. SpaceX could launch the GPS III Space Vehicle 09 (SV09) within the next few weeks, as the satellite was entering the final stages of pre-flight preparations.

The trade is logical … SV09 was originally awarded to ULA as part of order-year five of the National Security Space Launch (NSSL) Phase 2 contract, which was announced on October 31, 2023. This isn’t the first time that the Space Force has shuffled timelines and switched launch providers for GPS missions. In May 2025, SpaceX launched the GPS III SV08 spacecraft, which was originally assigned to ULA in June 2023. In exchange, ULA was given the SV11 launch, which would have flown on a Falcon Heavy rocket. The changes have been driven largely by repeated delays in Vulcan readiness.

            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-01-15</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2026/01/big-pharma-is-openly-railing-against-rfk-jr-s-anti-vaccine-agenda/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Pharmaceutical executives are finally saying how they really feel about the extreme anti-vaccine agenda Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has been ruthlessly implementing—and it’s not pretty.

According to reporting from Bloomberg at the J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference that ended today in San Francisco, pharmaceutical executives who had previously been careful to avoid criticizing the Trump administration appear to have reached a breaking point, with Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla offering some of the most candid comments.

“I am very annoyed. I’m very disappointed. I’m seriously frustrated,” Bourla said. “What is happening has zero scientific merit and is just serving an agenda which is political, and then antivax.”

Last week, Kennedy and other health officials abruptly announced a mass overhaul of the childhood vaccine schedule, dropping the number of routine recommended vaccinations from 17 to 11. The drastic and unprecedented change bypassed all the scientific review and transparent decision-making processes that would normally underpin such changes, which would likely have taken months if not years.

Kennedy claimed that the move puts the US more in line with peer nations, but as an analysis by Stat News pointed out, the US is now an outlier, recommending significantly fewer vaccines than many other countries. Of 20 so-called peer countries that Stat compared, only one other country has a similarly low number of recommendations: Denmark.

Leading medical groups, including the American Academy of Pediatrics, are preparing a legal challenge to block the changes.

But pharmaceutical executives don’t appear comforted by the pushback. “Today it may be childhood vaccines or mRNA, but tomorrow it’s everything,” Noubar Afeyan, co-founder and chairman of Moderna, maker of mRNA vaccines, said. “We have to say not just ‘why is this happening?,’ but ‘Where will it stop?’”

As a bad flu season is underway, Dean Li, president of Merck Research Laboratories, noted that the anti-vaccine rhetoric is hitting seasonal flu shots. “With the pressure on vaccination, I cannot foresee flu vaccination increasing in this country over the next three years,” he said in a presentation.

Sanofi Chief Executive Paul Hudson had a similarly pessimistic outlook. “It’s clear this administration has a particular sensitivity around vaccination, and indeed pediatric vaccination,” Hudson said. “I’m asked all the time ‘what are you going to do to fix this?,’ and the truth is we just need to stay extremely objective and continue presenting the evidence. There’s really very little else we can do,” except wait for the midterm elections, he said.

“We will have to maintain a steely focus on the long-term future of vaccines and deal with any uncertainty around vaccine coverage rates in the short-term based on misinformation, Facebook posts, and statements from the top,” he said.

Bourla also worried about the conditions Kennedy is creating to attack drug makers. Kennedy, who is an environmental lawyer with no scientific or medical background, has profited from lawsuits against vaccine makers, as have many of his allies and advisors. “There is also a lot of plaintiffs’ playbook there,” Bourla said. “Everybody will start litigating.”</div>

            <h2>Doctor Says Trump Appears to Have Suffered a Stroke</h2>
            <p><strong>Futurism | 2026-01-16</strong></p>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">When Donald Trump won his second term in the White House, he was the oldest man in the history of the United States to do so. Assuming he serves for his entire term, he’ll be 82 years and seven months old by the time he leaves office — breaking Joe Biden’s record of 82 years and two months.

And like Biden, some major questions are swirling around Trump as obvious signs of aging come to the fore. Speaking to the biographer Sidney Blumenthal and historian Sean Wilentz on their podcast The Court of History, Washington State University Professor of Medicine Bruce Davidson opined that Trump appears to have suffered a stroke that’s impacting his ability to move.

“My impression is that president Trump has had a stroke, and I think there’s several lines of evidence supporting that,” Davidson said. “I think his stroke was on the left side of the brain, which controls the right side of the body.” Based on what he’s seen, the doctor estimated the event happened “six months ago or more, earlier in 2025.”

“There’s video of him shuffling his feet, which is not what we’d seen him [doing], striding on the golf course,” the doctor continued. “He was garbling words, which he didn’t do previously, and which he’s improved upon more recently. And he’s also had marked episodes that have been noticed of daytime, excessive sleepiness, — medical term, hypersomnolence — which is characteristic of many patients after they’ve had a stroke.”

The most recent smoking gun, Davidson claimed, was a recent video of Trump gingerly walking down the stairs from Air Force One. As he descends the steps, the president grips the banister with his left hand, even though he’s right-handed.

“All of this is consistent with having had a stroke on the left side of his brain,” Davidson said.

While the assertion has some important implications for Trump himself, it would also mean that his entire administration has been lying to the American public about his health for months — echoing the health debacle surrounding Biden in his final years in office. That said, Davidson’s definitely not the first person to suggest Trump’s hiding a stroke in plain sight.

As questions of the president’s visible bruising and swollen ankles dominated headlines last July, the White House put out a statement admitting he had been diagnosed with chronic venous insufficiency. In mid-October, Trump was taken for a mysterious check-up at Walter Reed Medical Center, which the White House claimed was a routine physical — even though it turned out Trump had gotten an MRI scan.

Earlier this month, Trump contradicted the administration’s earlier claims, stating that the trip involved a CT scan, not an MRI, which he underwent to “definitively rule out any cardiovascular issues.”

Without being able to examine the president directly, even the best professional diagnoses amount to speculation at best — and given Trump’s history of offering up bizarre claims about his health, it’s unlikely the public will get any clarity any time soon.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The use of generative AI for creative purposes has spawned a major countermovement. From game developers reeling from a wave of criticism for using the tech to artists staging mass protests against AI, the backlash against what’s being hailed as a technological revolution grew massively last year.

In a startlingly literal example of this growing fury, a University of Alaska Fairbanks undergraduate student was detained after ripping “artwork off the walls and eating it in a reported protest,” according to a university police department statement quoted by the school’s student newspaper, The Sun Star.

The student, Graham Granger, was accused of chewing and spitting out small images that were pinned to the wall of a UAF art exhibit, which featured 160 AI-generated images by fine arts student Nick Dwyer. Photos taken by The Sun Star show crumpled-up pieces of paper strewn across a polished concrete floor.

According to the police department, Granger chewed up at least 57 of the 160 images. As a result, the undergraduate student was arrested for “criminal mischief in the 5th degree and booked at the Fairbanks Correctional Center,” according to the student newspaper.

It’s yet another example of how anti-AI sentiment is gripping the art world, highlighting a heated debate over human authorship and expression in a world filled with text-to-image generators that can conjure up works from a simple prompt in an instant.

Dwyer has since defended his work, telling The Sun Star that he had been using AI for his art since 2017. He said his exhibit “explores identity, character narrative creation and crafting false memories of relationships in an interactive role digitally crafted before, during and after a state of AI psychosis.”

The term “AI psychosis” has been used by health professionals to describe a troubling phenomenon in which users of AI tools are experiencing symptoms of psychosis or delusional episodes. Experts have raised concerns over the trend, warning that more and more people could be caught up in these delusions as they become hooked on AI chatbots like OpenAI’s ChatGPT.

In extreme cases, these tools have been alleged to have led to numerous deaths, including the suicide of a 16-year-old.

Dwyer told The Sun Star that he had fallen into AI psychosis himself, turning to art to portray the experience.

The art world has been reeling from a flood of AI-generated pieces for years now. We’ve seen instances of artists being wrongfully accused of using the tech, while others, like users on the subreddit Defending AI Art, are arguing that it’s an entirely legitimate way of expressing oneself.

A similar situation is playing out in the music industry as well, with music streaming services hosting cheap AI knockoffs of real artists’ works.

Just this week, music distribution platform Bandcamp announced that it was banning AI-generated songs — a move that was met with an outpouring of support.

            <div id="article-text">What do you get when you put a vaccine conspiracy theorist in charge of the agency responsible for funding medical research throughout the globe? A recipe for Tuskegee 2.0, apparently.

Some bombshell reporting over the last month has revealed a monstrous plan by Robert F Kennedy Jr.’s Department of Health and Human Services to fund a $1.6 million study on hepatitis B vaccines among 14,000 newborns in the West African country of Guinea-Bissau. As protocol documents obtained by Inside Medicine show, the study would have been a “randomized controlled trial to assess the effects of neonatal Hepatitis B vaccination on early-life mortality, morbidity, and long-term developmental outcomes.”

In other words, Kennedy’s HHS was about to fund a study that withheld Hep B vaccinations from 7,000 infants in one of the poorest countries on earth — so that western researchers could compare their long-term health to babies that got the vaccine.

Earlier today, the Guardian revealed that the trial — slated to begin in 2027 — had been halted by officials in Guinea-Bissau, after weeks of outrage from health officials and researchers. Instead, Africa CDC told the Guardian the study would be reworked to address the ethics concerns that have become a rallying cry in the medical research community.

“This is another Tuskegee,” one anonymous CDC official told Inside Medicine prior to the trial’s cancellation.

They were refering to the Tuskegee syphilis study, an infamous experiment that ran from 1932 until 1972 in which 600 poor Black men with syphilis were studied to understand the long-term effects of the disease in exchange for “free medical care” from the US government.

The catch? Though penicillin was discovered to be an effective treatment for syphilis in 1943, study subjects were never offered the antibiotic, or even told they had syphilis in the first place — leaving them to suffer the full effects of the debilitating infection, even though it was fully treatable. It remains one of the most barbaric biomedical research studies in US history, and its cruelty is still felt to this day.

Continuing, the CDC official told Inside Medicine that “we are allowing children, infants, to be exposed to Hepatitis B when we could prevent it, and then follow them for five years to see what happens. That’s not long enough to see the long-term benefits, but might be long enough to find some non-specific effects.”

“Non-specific effects” is a key buzzword swirling around Kennedy’s orbit of vaccine skeptics and holistic wellness influences, which essentially means “unintended harms.” The HHS’s chosen researchers for the Guinea-Bissau study were Peter Aaby and Christine Stabell Benn, a controversial Danish couple who have spent years chasing after non-specific effects in vaccines.

Thankfully, “the good guys won,” as Paul Offit, an infectious disease physician told the Guardian. “This administration did not see people in Africa as valuable… We were able to stand up for them. We were able to convince people about the fact that this was unethical.”

            <div id="article-text">For over two decades, millions of people volunteered the computational capacity of their computers to help UC Berkeley scientists in their search for extraterrestrial intelligence (SETI).

The goal of the project, called SETI@home, was to trawl through data collected by the Arecibo Observatory in Puerto Rico for signs of unusual radio signals from the cosmos. It was a powerful example of “distributed computing,” which relies on a huge network of individual computers — but whether the search has borne any fruit remains unclear as scientists continue to analyze the wealth of data.

SETI@home concluded after 21 years in 2020, producing a whopping 12 billion detections, according to a UC Berkeley press release, making it “one of the most popular crowd-sourced research projects ever.”

Over the years, researchers whittled down the data to just 100 signals that were “worth a second look” by eliminating radio frequency interference and noise with the help of a supercomputer. Since July, they’ve been using China’s Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical Telescope (FAST), in the hopes of catching another glimpse of the identified targets.

Unfortunately, the Arecibo Observatory — once the world’s largest radio telescope — collapsed during a storm in 2020, and is being decommissioned.

Even if the project never leads to first contact with an intelligent extraterrestrial species, it doesn’t mean SETI@home was a waste of time. Researchers are still trawling through the FAST data, but early conclusions of the project and its effectiveness have already resulted in two papers that were published last year in The Astronomical Journal.

“If we don’t find ET, what we can say is that we established a new sensitivity level,” said project cofounder David Anderson in a statement. “If there were a signal above a certain power, we would have found it.”

The team is hoping to inspire a successor to the crowdsourced research project, while applying what they’ve learned.

“Some of our conclusions are that the project didn’t completely work the way we thought it was going to,” Anderson said. “And we have a long list of things that we would have done differently and that future sky survey projects should do differently.”

Astronomer and project director Eric Korpela also pointed out that the considerable amount of radio interference, which can emanate from other sources, including radio and TV broadcasts and even microwave ovens, could seriously mess with the data.

“We have to do a better job of measuring what we’re excluding,” he said. “Are we throwing out the baby with the bath water? I don’t think we know for most SETI searches, and that is really a lesson for SETI searches everywhere.”

Given the lack of a smoking gun after trawling “billions and billions” of stars in the Milky Way, the project left the alien-hunting organizers somewhat deflated.

“We are, without doubt, the most sensitive narrow-band search of large portions of the sky, so we had the best chance of finding something,” Korpela explained. “So yeah, there’s a little disappointment that we didn’t see anything.”

However, the researcher hasn’t given up on the idea, particularly given the immense advancements in computer power and improved internet connections.

“I think that you could still get significantly more processing power than we used for SETI@home and process more data because of a wider internet bandwidth,” Korpela said. However, “the biggest issue with such a project is that it requires personnel, and personnel means salaries. It’s not the cheapest way to do SETI.”

And plenty of what-ifs remain, especially considering the limitations of the SETI@home project.

“There’s still the potential that ET is in that data and we missed it just by a hair,” he pondered.

            <h2>Researchers Just Found Something That Could Shake the AI Industry to Its Core</h2>
            <p><strong>Futurism | 2026-01-16</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://futurism.com/artificial-intelligence/ai-industry-recall-copyright-books">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">For years now, AI companies, including Google, Meta, Anthropic, and OpenAI, have insisted that their large language models aren’t technically storing copyrighted works in their memory and instead “learn” from their training data like a human mind.

It’s a carefully worded distinction that’s been integral to their attempts to defend themselves against a rapidly growing barrage of legal challenges.

It also cuts to the core of copyright law itself. Copyright is a form of intellectual property law designed to protect original works and their creators. Under the US Copyright Act of 1976, a copyright owner has the exclusive right to “reproduce, adapt, distribute, publicly perform, and publicly display the work.”

But, crucially, the “fair use” doctrine holds that others can use copyrighted materials for purposes like criticism, journalism, and research. That’s been the AI industry’s defense in court against accusations of infringement; OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has gone as far as to say that it’s “over” if the industry isn’t allowed to freely leverage copyrighted data to train its models.

Rights holders have long cried foul, accusing AI companies of training their models on pirated and copyrighted works, effectively monetizing them without ever fairly remunerating authors, journalists, and artists. It’s a years-long legal battle that’s already led to a high-profile settlement.

Now, a damning new study could put AI companies on the defensive. In it, Stanford and Yale researchers found compelling evidence that AI models are actually copying all that data, not “learning” from it. Specifically, four prominent LLMs — OpenAI’s GPT-4.1, Google’s Gemini 2.5 Pro, xAI’s Grok 3, and Anthropic’s Claude 3.7 Sonnet — happily reproduced lengthy excerpts from popular — and protected — works, with a stunning degree of accuracy.

They found that Claude outputted “entire books near-verbatim” with an accuracy rate of 95.8 percent. Gemini reproduced the novel “Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone” with an accuracy of 76.8 percent, while Claude reproduced George Orwell’s “1984” with a higher than 94 percent accuracy compared to the original — and still copyrighted — reference material.

“While many believe that LLMs do not memorize much of their training data, recent work shows that substantial amounts of copyrighted text can be extracted from open-weight models,” the researchers wrote.

Some of these reproductions required the researchers to jailbreak the models with a technique called Best-of-N, which essentially bombards the AI with different iterations of the same prompt. (Those kinds of workarounds have already been used by OpenAI to defend itself in a lawsuit filed by the New York Times, with its lawyers arguing that “normal people do not use OpenAI’s products in this way.”)

The implications of the latest findings could be substantial as copyright lawsuits play out in courts across the country. As The Atlantic‘s Alex Reisner points out, the results further undermine the AI industry’s argument that LLMs “learn” from these texts instead of storing information and recalling it later. It’s evidence that “may be a massive legal liability for AI companies” and “potentially cost the industry billions of dollars in copyright-infringement judgments.”

Whether AI companies are liable for copyright infringement remains a subject of heated debate. Stanford law professor Mark Lemley, who has represented AI companies in copyright lawsuits, told The Atlantic that he isn’t sure whether an AI model “contains” a copy of a book or can reproduce it “on the fly in response to a request.”

Unsurprisingly, the industry is continuing to argue that they’re technically not replicating protected works. In 2023, Google told the US Copyright Office that “there is no copy of the training data — whether text, images, or other formats — present in the model itself.”

OpenAI also told the office in the same year that its “models do not store copies of the information that they learn from.”

To The Atlantic‘s Reisner, the analogy that AI models learn like humans is a “deceptive, feel-good idea that prevents the public discussion we need to have about how AI companies are using the creative and intellectual works upon which they are utterly dependent.”

But whether the judges overseeing the litany of copyright lawsuits will agree with that sentiment remains to be seen. The stakes are considerable, particularly as it becomes harder and harder for authors, journalists, and other content creators to make a living — while the AI industry swells to unfathomable value.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Much ink has been spilled over US health secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s dalliances with anti-vaccine conspiracy theories, brain worms, nicotine pouches, and bizarre self-treatment with a synthetic dye known as methylene blue.

In spite of all those wellness eccentricities of his own, Kennedy is apparently in awe of his boss Donald Trump, who he says spends his days “pumping himself full of poison.”

In a recent appearance on the Katie Miller Podcast — hosted by the wife of Stephen Miller, who currently serves as homeland security advisor to the White House — Kennedy expressed astonishment that the president is even alive.

“He eats really bad food,” the health secretary dished. “Which is McDonald’s, and, you know, candy and Diet Coke. But he drinks Diet Coke at all times. He has the constitution of a deity — I don’t know how he’s alive, but he is.”

Though Kennedy acknowledged that Trump eats “really good food” when he’s staying in a place like Mar-a-Lago, he says those habits fall away the second he gets on the road.

“If you travel with him you get this idea that he’s just pumping himself full of poison all day,” Kennedy told Miller. “He wants to eat food from big corporations because he trusts it and he doesn’t want to get sick when he’s on the road.”

Trump’s health woes have been a topic of heated debate since he assumed his second term in office. He’s currently the oldest person to be elected president in US history, a superlative which has come with complications like daytime fatigue, visible bruising, and what his critics say is observable cognitive decline. (A mysterious CT scan that the president has struggled to explain hasn’t helped dispel those concerns.)

Whether Trump’s diet is contributing to his health woes is hard to say for certain — the administration insists he remains perfectly fit — but if Kennedy’s astonishment is any indication, the BigMacs certainly aren’t helping.

            <p><strong>TechCrunch | 2026-01-16</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/16/how-a-hacking-campaign-targeted-high-profile-gmail-and-whatsapp-users-across-the-middle-east/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">On Tuesday, U.K.-based Iranian activist Nariman Gharib tweeted redacted screenshots of a phishing link sent to him via a WhatsApp message.

“Do not click on suspicious links,” Gharib warned. The activist, who is following the digital side of the Iranian protests from afar, said the campaign targeted people involved in Iran-related activities, such as himself.

This hacking campaign comes as Iran grapples with the longest nationwide internet shutdown in its history, as anti-government protests — and violent crackdowns — rage across the country. Given that Iran and its closest adversaries are highly active in the offensive cyberspace (read: hacking people), we wanted to learn more.

Gharib shared the full phishing link with TechCrunch soon after his post, allowing us to capture a copy of the source code of the phishing web page used in the attack. He also shared a write-up of his findings.

TechCrunch analyzed the source code of the phishing page, and with added input from security researchers, we believe the campaign aimed to steal Gmail and other online credentials, compromise WhatsApp accounts, and conduct surveillance by stealing location data, photos, and audio recordings.

It is unclear, however, if the hackers were government-linked agents, spies, or cybercriminals — or all three.

TechCrunch also identified a way to view a real-time copy of all the victims’ responses saved on the attacker’s server, which was left exposed and accessible without a password. This data revealed dozens of victims who had unwittingly entered their credentials into the phishing site and were subsequently likely hacked.

The list includes a Middle Eastern academic working in national security studies; the boss of an Israeli drone maker; a senior Lebanese cabinet minister; at least one journalist; and people in the United States or with U.S. phone numbers.

TechCrunch is publishing our findings after validating much of Gharib’s report. The phishing site is now down.

According to Gharib, the WhatsApp message he received contained a suspicious link, which loaded a phishing site in the victim’s browser.

The link shows that the attackers relied on a dynamic DNS provider called DuckDNS for their phishing campaign. Dynamic DNS providers allow people to connect easy-to-remember web addresses — in this case, a duckdns.org subdomain — to a server where its IP address might frequently change.

It’s not clear whether the attackers shut down the phishing site of their own accord or were caught and cut off by DuckDNS. We reached out to DuckDNS with inquiries, but its owner Richard Harper requested that we send an abuse report instead.

From what we understand, the attackers used DuckDNS to mask the real location of the phishing page, presumably to make it look like a genuine WhatsApp link.

The phishing page was actually hosted at alex-fabow.online, a domain that was first registered in early November 2025. This domain has several other, related domains hosted on the same dedicated server, and these domain names follow a pattern that suggests the campaign also targeted other providers of virtual meeting rooms, like meet-safe.online and whats-login.online.

We’re not sure what happens while the DuckDNS link loads in the victim’s browser, or how the link determines which specific phishing page to load. It may be that the DuckDNS link redirects the target to a specific phishing page based on information it gleans from the user’s device.

The phishing page would not load in our web browser, preventing us from directly interacting with it. Reading the source code of the page, however, allowed us to better understand how the attack worked.

Depending on the target, tapping on a phishing link would open a fake Gmail login page, or ask for their phone number, and begin an attack flow aimed at stealing their password and two-factor authentication code.

But the source code of the phishing page code had at least one flaw: TechCrunch found that by modifying the phishing page’s URL in our web browser, we could view a file on the attacker’s servers that was storing records of every victim who had entered their credentials.

The file contained over 850 records of information submitted by victims during the attack flow. These records detailed each part of the phishing flow that the victim was in. This included copies of the usernames and passwords that victims had entered on the phishing page, as well as incorrect entries and their two-factor codes, effectively serving as a keylogger.

The records also contained each victim’s user agent, a string of text that identifies the operating system and browser versions used to view websites. This data shows that the campaign was designed to target Windows, macOS, iPhone, and Android users.

The exposed file allowed us to follow the attack flow step-by-step for each victim. In one case, the exposed file shows a victim clicking on a malicious link, which opened a page that looked like a Gmail sign-in window. The log shows the victim entering their email credentials several times until they enter the correct password.

The records show the same victim entering their two-factor authentication code sent to them by text message. We can tell this because Google sends two-factor codes in a specific format (usually G-xxxxxx, featuring a six-digit numerical code).

Beyond credential theft, this campaign also seemed to enable surveillance by tricking victims into sharing their location, audio, and pictures from their device.

In Gharib’s case, tapping on the link in the phishing message opened a fake WhatsApp-themed page in his browser, which displayed a QR code. The lure aims to trick the target into scanning the code on their device, purportedly to access a virtual meeting room.

Gharib said the QR code was generated by the attacker, and scanning or tapping it would instantly link the victim’s WhatsApp account to a device controlled by the attacker, granting them access to the victim’s data. This is a long-known attack technique that abuses the WhatsApp device linking feature and has been similarly abused to target users of messaging app Signal.

We asked Granitt founder Runa Sandvik, a security researcher who works to help secure at-risk individuals, to examine a copy of the phishing page code and see how it functions.

Sandvik found that when the page loaded, the code would trigger a browser notification asking the user for permission to access their location (via navigator.geolocation), as well as photos and audio (navigator.getUserMedia).

If accepted, the browser would immediately send the person’s coordinates to the attacker, capable of identifying the location of the victim. The page would then continue to share the victim’s location data every few seconds, for as long as the page remained open.

The code also allowed the attackers to record bursts of audio and snap photos every three to five seconds using the device camera. However, we did not see any location data, audio, or images that had been collected on the server.

We do not know who is behind this campaign. What is clear is that the campaign was successful in stealing credentials from victims, and it is possible that the phishing campaign could resurface.

Despite knowing the identities of some of the people in this cluster of victims who were targeted, we don’t have enough information to understand the nature of the campaign. The number of victims hacked by this campaign (that we know of) is fairly low — fewer than 50 individuals — and affects seemingly ordinary people across the Kurdish community, as well as academics, government officials, business leaders, and other senior figures across the broader Iranian diaspora and Middle East.

It may be that there are far more victims than we are aware of, which could help us understand who was targeted and potentially why.

It is unclear what motivated the hackers to steal people’s credentials and hijack their WhatsApp accounts, which could also help identify who is behind this hacking campaign.

A government-backed group, for example, might want to steal the email password and two-factor codes of a high-value target, like a politician or journalist, so they can download private and confidential information.

That could make sense since Iran is currently almost entirely cut off from the outside world, and getting information in or out of the country presents a challenge. Both the Iranian government, or a foreign government with interests in Iran’s affairs, could plausibly want to know who influential Iranian-linked individuals are communicating with, and what about.

As such, the timing of this phishing campaign and who it appears to be targeting could point to an espionage campaign aimed at trying to collect information about a narrow list of people.

We asked Gary Miller, a security researcher at Citizen Lab and mobile espionage expert, to also review the phishing code and some of the exposed data from the attacker’s server.

Miller said the attack “certainly [had] the hallmarks of an IRGC-linked spearphishing campaign,” referring to highly targeted email hacks carried out by Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), a faction of Iran’s military known for carrying out cyberattacks. Miller pointed to a mix of indications, including the international scope of victim targeting, credential theft, the abuse of popular messaging platforms like WhatsApp, and social engineering techniques used in the phishing link.

On the other hand, a financially motivated hacker could use the same stolen Gmail password and two-factor code of another high-value target, such as a company executive, to steal proprietary and sensitive business information from their inbox. The hacker could also forcibly reset passwords of their victim’s cryptocurrency and bank accounts to empty their wallets.

The campaign’s focus on accessing a victim’s location and device media, however, is unusual for a financially motivated actor, who might have little use for pictures and audio recordings.

We asked Ian Campbell, a threat researcher at DomainTools, which helps analyze public internet records, to look at the domain names used in the campaign to help understand when they were first set up, and if these domains were connected to any other previously known or identified infrastructure.

Campbell found that while the campaign targeted victims in the midst of Iran’s ongoing nationwide protests, its infrastructure had been set up weeks ago. He added that most of the domains connected to this campaign were registered in early November 2025, and one related domain was created months back in August 2025. Campbell described the domains as medium to high risk and said they appear to be linked to a cybercrime operation driven by financial motivations.

An additional wrinkle is that Iran’s government has been known to outsource cyberattacks to criminal hacking groups, presumably to shield its involvement in hacking operations against its citizens. The U.S. Treasury has sanctioned Iranian companies in the past for acting as fronts for Iran’s IRGC and conducting cyberattacks, such as launching targeted phishing and social engineering attacks.

As Miller notes, “This drives home the point that clicking on unsolicited WhatsApp links, no matter how convincing, is a high-risk, unsafe practice.”

            <div id="article-text">Elon Musk’s X is experiencing its second large-scale outage this week.

The site and app, formerly known as Twitter, are either not loading at all or are glitching into life briefly before throwing up error messages like gang signs.

The site Down Detector shows nearly 80,000 reports of X being down, starting at around 10 a.m. Eastern time, and is still down at the time of this writing.

This is the second major outage at X this week, following an earlier technical issue. It comes as the platform faces criticism after Grok, xAI’s chatbot that is integrated into X, has been fulfilling user requests to manipulate real photos of women, and even children, into nonconsensual sexual and violent imagery.

When Musk took over Twitter in 2022, he laid off much of the staff, sparking worries that the site wouldn’t be able to function normally or adequately monitor for harmful content. The site has largely remained running, though there were notable outages last year.

TechCrunch has reached out to X for comment.

            <h2>Chinese EVs inch closer to the US as Canada slashes tariffs</h2>
            <p><strong>TechCrunch | 2026-01-16</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/16/chinese-evs-inch-closer-to-the-us-as-canada-slashes-tariffs/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney announced Friday that his country will slash its 100% import tax on Chinese EVs to just 6.1%, paving the way for companies like Geely, BYD, Xiaomi, and others to establish a second foothold in the North American automotive market.

Canada is not going all-in on Chinese EVs, though. The country will initially cap annual imports at 49,000 vehicles. That cap will slowly increase to about 70,000 in around five years, according to the Associated Press.

It’s a major shift that comes at a time when China is looking to boost EV exports, especially as the European Union weighs lowering its own tariffs on the vehicles. The U.S. remains a holdout on that front, though this week President Trump said he’d be open to Chinese automakers building factories in the U.S. that produce EVs.

China has already been exporting gas, hybrid, and electric vehicles to Mexico, with the latter especially booming in 2025. Many of the leading EV-makers in China have been agitating to enter the U.S. market, including Geely, which held a drive event at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas last week. While the company was showcasing a number of models ostensibly meant for the Mexican market, one of its communications executives implied the conglomerate is aiming to announce an entry into the U.S. in the next two-to-three years.

Automotive journalists, influencers, and even some executives — most notably Ford CEO Jim Farley — have praised the quality of Chinese EVs over the last few years.

But the 100% tariff on Chinese cars has so far made the idea of exporting them to the U.S. a non-starter. That’s despite the fact that Chinese EVs are sold at far lower prices than the average car in the U.S. — a feat typically achieved through a combination of extremely low cost of capital, labor, and a willingness to burn money to gain market share.

China’s ability to undercut other automakers on price is just one concern. The U.S. has spent the last few years trying to separate itself from China’s EV supply chain for national security reasons, under both Presidents Biden and Trump. There are other legal hurdles too. Last year, the U.S. Department of Commerce’s Bureau of Industry and Security issued a rule restricting the import and sale of certain connected vehicles and related hardware and software linked to China or Russia.

On Thursday, Avery Ash, the CEO of nonprofit Securing America’s Future Energy, cautioned against Trump’s idea of allowing Chinese automakers to build cars in the United States.

“We’ve seen this strategy backfire in Europe and elsewhere—it would have potentially catastrophic impacts on our automotive industry, have ripple effects on our entire defense industrial base, and make every American less secure,” he said in a statement. “We urge the President to stay tough against China and protect American auto manufacturers and workers.”

            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/16/youtube-relaxes-monetization-guidelines-for-some-controversial-topics/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">YouTube is updating its advertiser-friendly content guidelines to allow more videos on controversial issues to earn full ad revenue, as long as they’re dramatized or discussed in a non-graphic manner. These controversial topics include self-harm, abortion, suicide, and domestic and sexual abuse. YouTube notes that content on child abuse or eating disorders will remain ineligible for full monetization.

YouTube announced the change this week in a video on its Creator Insider channel.

“In the past, the degree of graphic or descriptive detail was not considered a significant factor in determining advertiser friendliness, even for some dramatized material,” YouTube explained. “Consequently, such uploads typically received a yellow dollar icon, which restricted their ability to be fully monetized. With this week’s update, our guidelines are becoming more permissive, and creators will be able to earn more ad revenue.”

The Google-owned company says it’s making the change in response to creator feedback that YouTube’s guidelines were leading to limited ad revenue on dramatized and topical content. YouTube notes that it wants to ensure that creators who are telling sensitive stories or producing dramatized content have the opportunity to earn ad revenue.

“We took a closer look and found our guidelines in this area had become too restrictive and ended up demonetizing uploads like dramatized content,” YouTube said. “This content might reference topics that advertisers find controversial, but are ultimately comfortable running their ads against. For example, content may be in a fictional context or voiced from personal experiences in passing or in a non-graphic manner. So, as long as the content steers clear of very descriptive or graphic scenes or segments, creators can now earn more ad revenue.”

The move comes as YouTube has been easing up on how it polices content on its platform.

The company told moderators last year to leave up videos that may violate platform rules if they are considered to be in the public interest. The New York Times reported at the time that these videos included discussions of political, social, and cultural issues. The policy shift came at a time when social media platforms were rolling back online speech moderation after President Donald Trump returned to office.

YouTube notes that there are still some areas where ads will remain restricted, as topics like child abuse, including child sex trafficking and eating disorders, are not included in this update. Descriptive segments of those topics or dramatized content around them remain ineligible for ad revenue.

            <h2>Bluesky rolls out cashtags and LIVE badges amid a boost in app installs</h2>
            <p><strong>TechCrunch | 2026-01-16</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/16/bluesky-rolls-out-cashtags-and-live-badges-amid-a-boost-in-app-installs/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Social network Bluesky is updating its app to allow anyone to share when they’re livestreaming on Twitch, and adding specialized hashtags, known as cashtags, for discussing publicly traded stocks.

The new features could potentially help Bluesky capitalize on a recent boost in new installs, which have arrived in the days after the X deepfake news went mainstream.

On X, users were asking its integrated AI bot Grok to turn photos of real women and sometimes minors into sexualized images without consent. This week, California’s attorney general opened an investigation into xAI’s chatbot over the proliferation of the “nonconsensual sexually explicit material.”

In the wake of the controversy, Bluesky saw its downloads surge in the U.S. According to new data from market intelligence provider Appfigures, daily downloads of Bluesky’s iOS app have jumped nearly 50% from the period before news of the deepfakes reached critical mass.

The firm says Bluesky typically sees around 4,000 installs in the U.S. per day, but from December 30, 2025, through January 6, 2026, Bluesky’s iOS downloads in the U.S. totaled around 19,500. From January 7, 2026, through January 14, downloads grew to 29,000 — a 49% increase.

Meanwhile, cashtags will allow the app to catch up to one of X’s more popular use cases: discussing stocks. To create a cashtag, you place a dollar symbol before the stock ticker symbol (e.g., $AAPL for Apple).

The idea for cashtags was first introduced by stocks-focused social network Stocktwits, which now has over 10 million users, before the tags were later adopted by Twitter in 2012.

In addition, Bluesky says it’s expanding access to the “Live Now” experimental feature that lets users add a temporary “LIVE” badge to their avatar to indicate when they’re streaming online. Currently, this feature only supports Twitch and doesn’t allow anyone to go live directly on Bluesky itself.

The boost in activity on Bluesky comes after the network saw declines in downloads and usage last year. In April 2025, Appfigures noted that the social networking startup’s downloads dropped to new lows, and daily average users on mobile devices had declined nearly 40% by the end of October, per Similarweb data. Pew Research reported last year that a number of influencers now have Bluesky accounts, but they still tend to post more regularly on X.

This suggests that the switching costs are higher than some would expect when it comes to swapping out one real-time social network for another. Adding new features will only be part of the battle for Bluesky; it will also have to find a way to get users to change years of ingrained behavior.

            <h2>Italy investigates Activision Blizzard for pushing in-game purchases</h2>
            <p><strong>TechCrunch | 2026-01-16</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/16/italy-investigates-activision-blizzard-for-pushing-in-game-purchases/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Italy has launched two investigations into Microsoft’s Activision Blizzard, alleging the company has engaged in “misleading and aggressive” sales practices for its popular smartphone games Diablo Immortal and Call of Duty Mobile.

The country’s competition regulator, Autorità Garante della Concorrenza E Del Mercato (AGCM), said the investigations focus on the use of design elements to induce users, particularly children, into playing for long periods, and make in-game purchases by urging them to not miss out on rewards.

“These practices, together with strategies that make it difficult for users to understand the real value of the virtual currency used in the game and the sale of in-game currency in bundles, may influence players as consumers — including minors — leading them to spend significant amounts, sometimes exceeding what is necessary to progress in the game and without being fully aware of the expenditure involved,” the AGCM wrote in a statement.

The AGCM said the games are advertised as free-to-play but offer in-game purchases.

That isn’t particularly surprising, however, as, unlike full-priced games, free-to-play games have long relied on loot boxes and sales of in-game cosmetics for monetization. Diablo Immortal, for example, offers in-game cosmetics, as well as currency that allows players to accelerate their progression and gain items for crafting, for as much as $200.

Given the nature of the game, it’s not unusual for many users to repeatedly spend on such items in the course of play.

Both Diablo Immortal and Call of Duty Mobile have player bases in the hundreds of thousands.

The authority is also looking into the games’ parental control features, as the default settings lets minors make in-game purchases, play for long periods without restraints, and allow them to chat with others in-game. The AGCM also highlighted privacy concerns, as the games appear to lead users to select all consent options when signing up, and said it would look into the company’s consent process for harvesting and using personal data.

“In the Authority’s view, the company may be acting in breach of consumer protection rules and, in particular, the duty of professional diligence required in a sector that is particularly sensitive to the risks of gaming-related addiction,” the regulator said.

Activision Blizzard did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-01-16</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/2026/01/the-iranians-who-feel-betrayed-by-the-left/685644/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Whenever I hear the plaintive lyrics of “Baraye,” the song that became an anthem for the 2022 Iranian protests, I still tear up—and I find it hard to imagine anyone having a different reaction. Shervin Hajipour, then 25, wrote it by stringing together a list of young Iranians’ reasons for going to the streets. They want to kiss in public without fear and not be forced to spout empty slogans. They want an economic future and clean air. These are what the Czech dissident Václav Havel called the “aims of life,” which in authoritarian counties, places like Iran, slam right up against the “aims of the system.”

Iranians are out in those streets again, pursuing those aims. And this time they are being slaughtered for it in numbers that have not been seen before—estimates of the death toll are rough (because the internet and most international communication have been cut), but they run anywhere from 2,000 to 12,000.

This is a simple story: People are risking their life to resist tyranny, engaging in a human struggle for basic rights. Its resonance, particularly for those on the left, should be self-evident. It has all the greatest hits—pitting the powerless against power, freedom against repression, unarmed men and women against snipers. But in the most animated corners of the activist ecosystem, so recently energized by their opposition to the death and destruction in Gaza, it has not resonated. The protest has been viewed instead through the thick lens of ideology, producing a reaction that has been dismissive at best and, at worst, degrading to the Iranians themselves. Many thousands of demonstrators, rising up all over the country, are accused of being witless tools of an imperialist agenda, part of a “CIA-Mossad regime change campaign,” or maybe just actual “Mossad agents.”

These might be the most extreme examples—it’s easy enough to find any opinion on social media—but there are clear signs that they represent a pervasive line of thinking on the left. By Wednesday, they had reached a sustained-enough pitch that Cornel West, a high priest of anti-imperialism, was moved to reprimand his own comrades for “playing some ideological games”: “Shame on those on the left who view precious Iranians solely as pawns,” he said in a video posted on X. (For this, he was derided in replies as a “clown,” a “fool,” and “a useful tool of Zionism.”)

But I didn’t need to go online to see evidence of this myopia, or the effect that it is having on those who are distressed by what’s happening in Iran. I spoke this week with a number of Iranian exiles who consider themselves progressive and pro-Palestine—many of them used the word genocide, for instance, to talk about the conflict in Gaza. Overwhelmingly, they told me that they felt abandoned—rejected by peers whom they had believed shared their values. (I felt something like this myself in the days immediately following October 7.)

“I feel isolated and betrayed,” said Fatemeh Shams, a feminist scholar and poet at the University of Pennsylvania, referring to fellow academics. “I have already unfriended a bunch of these idiots who are, unfortunately, my colleagues. I don’t even know how I can bring myself, in the future, to even go to their conferences and give papers.”

In my conversations with these Iranian exiles, I heard deep frustration. Whether they are responding to social media or drawing conclusions from a lack of organizing was sometimes hard to tell, but they confirmed for me that this was not just a problem of the very online: The Iranian protesters stepping fearlessly into the sights of government snipers are being seen by the American left with more suspicion than sympathy. Perhaps I shouldn’t have been so surprised, given the state of American polarization. In many ways this is just the latest example of the epistemic rupture between left and right, a framework that applies settled, simplified templates to anything reality presents us with, including the recent shooting in Minneapolis—discarding what is inconvenient and swallowing what is most palatable.

This framework has ideological, if not factual, consistency. In the (admittedly) simplified version of the hard left’s worldview, the Iranian regime represents an anti-imperialist force that should be defended against America and Israel, two countries they view as agents of oppression. I can’t help but think of the way some intellectuals in the 1950s ignored Stalin’s Gulags because the Soviet Union was the side they wanted to support in the Cold War. From this Manichaean perspective, what is happening in Iran right now as the bodies pile up is possibly exaggerated, possibly the work of the Mossad or the CIA, or at the very least a disruption openly desired by Donald Trump and Benjamin Netanyahu (and therefore evil).

What could be fueling this perception on the left is the fact that the right is indeed viewing the protest through its own interests. Trump said he hopes to “make Iran great again”—though as of this writing, the president seems to have backed off his threat of intervention, convinced that “the killing in Iran is stopping—it’s stopped—it’s stopping,” as he stutteringly put it. To many on the left, agreeing with the premise that regime change would be optimal feels like encouraging the start of another war in the Middle East. And if you ask a college activist why they are willing to protest in support of Palestinians but not Iranians, they might answer, logically, that the United States is complicit in the killing in Gaza because of the money that flows to Israel, whereas it already sanctions the Islamic Republic—so there is no policy change to agitate for. This argument, however, sounds pedantic to me, like a point scored in a debate rather than a real explanation for why some human dramas compel empathy and action and others do not.

The Mossad and CIA conspiracy theories also draw on real facts: A slice of the opposition in Iran is loyal to Reza Pahlavi, a son of the former shah who expanded his power in 1953 with the CIA’s backing. Pahlavi does not seem to represent a democratic, pluralistic vision of the country’s future, and he is openly courting American and Israeli intervention.

This has all led to an orgy of whataboutism, as the left and the right mock each other for caring only about their favored victims. Lost in this pointless food fight is what is actually happening to the Iranian people, who are fighting against a sclerotic regime that has insinuated itself into the most private corners of their life and proved itself incapable of maintaining a standard of living for its citizens.

“We’re between a rock and a hard place,” Ali Abbasi, an Iranian-born film director based in Denmark, told me. “The left doesn’t believe us, because they think we have the wrong supporters. The right wants us to go and, you know, overthrow the Islamic Republic and install a pro-Israeli, pro-right” leader. “And in the middle are millions and millions of Iranian people who just know this system has hit an absolute dead end.”

I am not shocked by the positions held by the right; perhaps because of this, I feel more troubled by the quiet on the left. If you’re someone attuned to suffering, you should be strongly inclined to feel a sense of solidarity with the protesters in Iran. And I’d hoped that somewhere in the leftist body, beneath layers of ideological bloat, the muscle for expressing basic opposition to totalitarianism was intact. I don’t think I’m being self-indulgently nostalgic when I recall that there used to be an international left capable of activating on behalf of people fighting fascism anywhere in the world, simply as a matter of principle.

For the exiles I spoke with, the most disturbing—and telling—thing about the tepid response was the contrast with the impassioned reaction to Gaza. “Why is it that when Palestinians—armed or unarmed—fight for liberation, it is seen as a moral duty to support them, but when Iranians protest, they are labeled ‘armed terrorists’ or ‘agents of Mossad?’” Shams, the feminist scholar, said.

Janet Afary, a religious-studies professor at UC Santa Barbara, helped put this dissonance in context. She described for me a long history that would explain the left’s knee-jerk sympathy for the Islamic Republic, starting with the leftist elements that helped lead the 1979 revolution (alongside the clerics who ended up seizing full control). For those who want to see the end of Israel, the regime’s identity as a defender of Palestinian rights—and a funder of extremist anti-Israel groups such as Hamas and Hezbollah—has given it cachet.

Afary recalled confronting a colleague who was dismissive of the 2022 protests, which were largely driven by feminists; this person wondered why Iranian women can’t just wear hijab like other women in the Middle East. “Are you saying this because you don’t want the government of the Islamic Republic to be overthrown because it supports the Palestinian cause?” Afary asked her. She said yes. “To my face!” Afary said.

The ideological left doesn’t know what to do with violence that doesn’t involve a Western aggressor, according to Kamran Matin, another exile and an international-relations professor at the University of Sussex in England. Matin noted other groups that received only muted support from anti-imperialists, including the Yazidis, persecuted by ISIS, and Rohingya, victims of the Myanmar government—in which case the aggressors were not Western hegemons. If you jump to the barricades against these atrocities, “then the whole edifice of postcolonial anti-imperialism basically collapses. Because for them, it feels like they dilute their case against the West by accepting non-Western cases.”

I also wonder if what distinguishes Gaza from Iran is that Palestinian civilians represented perfect victims, people bombed simply for living in Gaza, especially in places where Hamas was operating. The picture in Iran is more complicated; the protesters are fighting for regime change, and they comprise a melange of opposition groups with various motives and ideas about a post-ayatollah Iran. The opponents of the mullahs are, for now, powerless against them. But they are also, ultimately, jockeying for power, with various international forces behind them. (This is true of Palestinians, of course, but the endgame seems very far off.) Outsiders might think that supporting the protests would amount to support for one or another faction.

This sort of litmus test is exactly what the exiles I spoke with find so disheartening because it doesn’t regard Iranians as people with agency who deserve their own freedom. Some even described as racist the assumption, as Abbasi put it, “that people of a country like Iran are never able to make their own decisions, and they’re always puppets of some government, some power.”

All you have to do, he added, is look at who is getting killed to understand that this is a movement of ordinary people—and he wants the focus to return to them. “Of the few people that are named among the killed, one of them was a costume-design student,” Abbasi said. “The other one was a bodybuilder. The third one was a sculptor. These are not the people who work for anyone. If the CIA was really using a sculptor to do armed operations in Iran, then it’s mismanaged.”

Nearly a week into the communications blackout, and with stories of extreme state violence leaking out, Abbasi and his fellow exiles seemed desperate to have their case taken up by as broad a public as possible, one that bridges partisan politics. But when I spoke with Siamak Aram, the president of the National Solidarity Group for Iran, he didn’t sound particularly hopeful on this point. He told me that a demonstration planned for this weekend, which was meant to bring together multiple factions of Iranian opposition, had almost no participation from non-Iranian activist groups.

This was unfortunate, Aram said, because the argument for supporting his people should be legible to the left. “If a police officer kneels on the neck of a man, we condemn that,” he said. “If a sniper shoots a girl in Tehran, we must condemn that.” Aram also thinks we need to find a way to see the human beings in this story. “The failure of both sides, of left and right, would be that they are letting their political calculator override their moral compass. They are asking, Who benefits if I condemn this?, instead of asking, What is wrong; what is right?”</div>

            <h2>Something Is Wrong With Russia’s Children</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-01-16</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/international/2026/01/russia-children-violence-war/685635/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">One Tuesday morning last month, a 15-year-old Russian boy got ready for school by packing a paramilitary vest, a helmet, and a knife. Before leaving his house, he sent a manifesto to his classmates denouncing gay people and Jews, and quoting a mass murderer along with a white-supremacist conspiracy theory.

When the boy, identified by prosecutors as Timofey K., arrived at his school, located outside Moscow, he went to the bathroom to put on his gear, which he’d branded with neo-Nazi symbols and racist slogans. Then he filmed himself patrolling the hallways and asking people, at knifepoint, what nationality they were. Several gave the wrong answer, and Timofey stabbed them. Most survived, but a 10-year-old boy from a Tajik family did not.

Timofey’s attack wasn’t the first instance of brutality among schoolchildren in Russia last month. Two weeks earlier, a ninth grader had beaten an eighth grader so severely that the latter couldn’t remember what had happened by the time he got to a hospital. The next day, a group of teenagers tortured a schoolgirl in the Ural region, cutting into her back with a knife. Less than a week later, schoolboys repeatedly kicked a 10-year-old student in the head. Several days after that, a ninth grader stabbed his math teacher in the back.

For years, children in Russia have watched their country massacre Ukrainians and condemn hundreds of thousands of its own citizens to injury and death at the front. As violence has come to surround Russian youth, many seem to have become more violent themselves. Last year, the number of juvenile crimes in the country surged by 18 percent. Authorities also reported an uptick in “serious and especially serious” crime. “There is no positive ideology for children in a country fighting a murderous war,” Ilya Barabanov, a Russian journalist, told me. Instead, the war has amplified worldviews that encourage brutality.

The ethnic hatred that inspired Timofey’s attack has spread widely in Russia, thanks in part to President Vladimir Putin’s embrace of a militant strain of nationalism. The president has justified the war in Ukraine by appealing to a doctrine known as Russkiy mir, or “Russian world,” which makes no room for non-Russians. (Some of Putin’s soldiers in Ukraine have worn the kolovrat symbol that Timofey affixed to his vest, a neopagan emblem resembling a swastika.) Last year, the Kremlin even encouraged law enforcement to cooperate with ultranationalist groups. They helped police round up and deport tens of thousands of immigrants, who evidently did not belong in the Russian world.

Putin has claimed that the Russkiy mir ideology is based on “openness and constant respect” for other cultures. Yet just this week, his key propagandist, the TV presenter Vladimir Solovyov, called for additional “special military operations” in Armenia and Central Asia in order to maintain Russia’s “sphere of influence”—the same pretext for its war in Ukraine. For the Kremlin, other cultures, it seems, are not an object of respect; they are a threat that only violence and aggression can neutralize.

Timofey’s attack was not an aberration. It is a product of Putin’s dogma, and it has energized Russia’s many networks of ultranationalists and other extremists. The day after the assault, journalists spotted a neo-Nazi banner on the wall of the Federal Security Service office in Sochi. On social media, a neo-Nazi paramilitary group known as Rusich Army posted photos to its more than 1 million followers of the insignia on Timofey’s equipment, which included the English acronym SYGAOWN—“Stop Your Genocide Against Our White Nations.” One image showed Timofey pointing a knife at the school’s security guard; Rusich Army superimposed its logo on Timofey’s hand, seeming to claim him as one of its own.

Extremist groups are growing, and they are threatening further violence. In 2023, a far-right nationalist movement called Russkaya Obshchina said that its inaugural congress attracted some 200 people; it claimed to host more than 1,200 last year, including two members of Parliament. Last month, shortly before Timofey’s attack, the group posted a video with English subtitles, which included: “I will sharpen the knife. I will load the gun.” In June, nationalist Telegram channels reposted a similar video promising “big blood.”

Alexander Verkhovsky, the director of the SOVA Centre for Information and Analysis, has studied Russia’s far-right movements and watched them expand. Every year from 2012 to 2022, he attended a council that Putin held with civil-society and human-rights groups. Verkhovsky warned Putin to his face about Russia’s growing xenophobia and the effect it could have on the country. Putin didn’t seem to listen.

Still, Verkhovsky told me that he has been surprised by just how quickly ultranationalism has taken root among Russian teenagers in particular—and just how violent they have become as a result.

Even some of Putin’s loyalists have expressed alarm. Nina Ostanina, a legislator who has largely endorsed Putin’s policies, responded to Timofey’s attack last month by telling the National News Service, “We see tragedy after tragedy. Our children are armed with a destructive ideology, and they don’t have a positive” alternative.

That might not be such a bad thing for Putin. Soon enough, Russia’s children will supply him with a new generation of eager soldiers.</div>

            <h2>The Question That the Lawyers Representing Trans Athletes Didn’t Answer</h2>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Transgender participation in women’s athletics is the single most difficult issue I’ve seen in 40 years of covering sports. It makes gambling, performance-enhancing drugs, and regulation of collegiate athletics look like tidy challenges. Two groups—trans women and cisgender women—both argue that they need equal protection from discrimination. But if they can’t have it at the same time in the often zero-sum realm of sports, who wins? As Justice Brett Kavanaugh put it during this week’s oral arguments in the first cases on the topic to come before the Supreme Court, “There are harms on both sides.”

At the core of the matter is whether trans-women athletes have a lingering testosterone advantage—a question that remains scientifically disputed. Until that point is settled, a resolution to this painful issue is hard to envision. Lawyers representing trans athletes in the two cases before the court—Little v. Hecox and West Virginia v. B.P.J., which challenge state laws that categorically ban trans women from women’s sports teams—made many torturous arguments. But they did not put forward winning ones. That’s a judgment not of their position, but of their performance. They failed to effectively answer this question: Does a trans woman who competes on a women’s team disadvantage other women?

The answer to this question is of vital importance to those who have fought for more than half a century to enforce Title IX. This stealthily radical law, enacted by Congress in 1972, forbids discrimination “on the basis of sex” in education and may be the closest thing this country has to an equal-rights amendment. It’s unclear how many people are directly affected by the issue of trans competitors in women’s sports—according to the NCAA, fewer than 10 trans students competed among 500,000 collegiate athletes in 2024. But to high-school and collegiate girls and women who fight tooth and nail for every scholarship, decent athletic facility, and ounce of confidence in what remains a man’s world, no number seems small. At the same time, few groups must fight harder for acceptance in a hostile world than trans women.

In Court this week, after more than three meandering hours of oral arguments, most of the justices didn’t seem to know what to do about this predicament, except that they’d rather not do much. This suggests that the Court may not issue a sweeping decision but will let states hash out matters locally, which would be a default loss for trans women: Currently, 29 states ban or restrict them from competing on women’s teams.

The dockets for Hecox and B.P.J. were loaded with amicus briefs that showed contradictory medical opinions. For the state petitioners, half a dozen sports doctors submitted 90 academic papers asserting that “even before puberty,” males have denser, stronger, and longer bones, and can “throw faster and kick harder than women.” They wrote, “No amount of testosterone suppression” would “eliminate these male athletic advantages.” According to one of those reports, boys had more speed, limb strength, and power as early as age 3.

The briefs in support of Becky Pepper-Jackson, the 15-year-old shot-putter and discus-thrower at the center of the West Virginia case, were equally adamant. Pepper-Jackson began transitioning from male to female when she was in third grade, and from sixth grade onward has taken medication to block male puberty, as well as estrogen treatment. Three researchers in exercise science wrote, “According to the scientific consensus there are no clear sex-based differences in athletic performance before the onset of puberty.” Furthermore, according to a study cited by Kathleen Hartnett, who represents the 24-year-old Idaho runner Lindsay Hecox, trans-women athletes could be at a disadvantage, if they have larger bones but less muscle and testosterone to drive their frame.

With the science unresolved, the word hypothetical was invoked by justices or counsel 18 times. Every which way the justices’ questions turned, there was a potential injustice for someone.

Where the respondents’ lawyers faltered the most was in addressing the potential harm to cisgender athletes. Hartnett admitted that the scientific record “is underdeveloped.” Joshua Block, representing Pepper-Jackson, insisted that his client has no physiological advantage at all, yet conceded that if she does in fact have an edge, “then we should lose.”

Kavanaugh asked during one exchange, “So why would we get involved at this point and constitutionalize?” The lawyers didn’t have a good answer for this or for the attendant question of how to view trans athletes under Title IX. The law forbids sex discrimination in education—yet Title IX makes an exception in recognizing biological differences in sports and allows teams to be girls- and women-only for the sake of safety, competitive fairness, and equal opportunity. Chief Justice John Roberts asked: Are trans athletes and their advocates asking the Court for an exception to the exception, and what would the constitutional implications of that be? “That would apply across an entire range of things,” he said, “where there’s a distinction currently between boys and girls quite apart from just athletics, is that correct?”

Roberts’s skepticism was not a good sign for the respondents. Roberts and Justice Neil Gorsuch joined their liberal colleagues in the 2020 Bostock v. Clayton County decision, which found that discriminating against gay and trans employees violated Title VII of the Civil Rights Act. But Roberts seemed to see a distinction between workplaces and playing fields, and he wasn’t the only one. Conservative and liberal justices alike seemed to share his worry that any ruling that touches on sex differences could be overbroad and misapplied to other areas.

Instead of answers to these concerns, the Court got evasions. Roberts pressed Hartnett as to whether she was challenging the distinction between boys and girls and asking for “an exception to the biological definition of girls.” Hartnett replied, “We’re not asking for a particular definition.” Her answers drew predictable irritation from Justice Samuel Alito, who asked, “How can a court determine whether there’s discrimination on the basis of sex without knowing what sex means for equal-protection purposes?” Yet Block seemed to want the Court to do just that. In a remarkably convoluted turn of phrase, Block said, “I wouldn’t look to whether or not it’s accurate to classify, you know, B.P.J. as—as male or female,” referring to the athlete he was representing. “I think the question is: Is she being denied an opportunity because of that classification?”

When was the last time you heard a lawyer say the words I don’t know? Because the fact is, when it comes to whether there is a legacy testosterone advantage, we don’t know. Separating people by sex, unlawful in most areas of civic life, is potentially vital to fairness in sports, just as we accept other classifications, such as weight and age, in the quest for an even starting line. A person can support trans civil rights with their whole heart and favor open competition for children yet also wonder whether athletes should compete in their birth category at the higher levels, for fear that a meaningful number of women may be harmed by transgender inclusion. Americans as a whole have yet to tease out a consensus philosophy on this, much less the biology of it. Until that happens, the justices would be wise to say that the issue lacks certainty, and to ask for more clarity and science before making a broad ruling.</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Based on how members of the Trump administration rushed to describe Renee Nicole Good, the Minneapolis woman who was shot and killed in her minivan while protesting ICE, as a “domestic terrorist,” a “professional agitator,” and an “anti-ICE rioter” behind the wheel of a “four-thousand-pound missile,” here is how they might describe her dropping off her son at school just before she was killed.

The terrorist drove a 4,000-pound guided missile to deliver her small associate to the rendezvous point. She pulled up to where dozens of others just like her were also making their sinister deliveries at “School.” (An ominously short, unpatriotic name for any building. Where is the “Trump”?) Their tiny accomplices climbed out of the rolling weapons, carrying bags on their backs full of scribbled writings—Codes, perhaps? Or manifestos?—in crayon and pencil and Magic Marker. Some of them were armed with Uncrustables, suspicious, round, sandwich-like objects full of jelly and peanut butter. (Deadly biohazards!) Others had juice boxes.

Despite the snow on the roads, these terrorists were out in force in their four-wheeled missiles. The missiles were garnished, in some cases, with stickers. (Stickers that have slogans on them, religious icons that almost seem to spell out COEXIST—a threat, to be certain.)

Some of them were wearing hats but no makeup. (The mark of a mind disturbed.) Some of these women had a husband at home, and some had a wife. (Could this be part of the hostility toward “traditional American views on family” that is listed in the Justice Department’s new definition of domestic terror?) All of them were up to no good.

More investigation would show their true motives: Who had been funding them? Who had filled their vehicles with such dangerous and costly equipment? You could see the other weapons they carried: stuffed animals (plush, scale models of deadly threats to human life), insufficiently deferential smiles, a disrespectful attitude toward law enforcement—carried openly, in the car, where a child could see them. Who would allow such a thing around a child, knowing its potency! A disrespectful attitude—the kind of weapon that would justify any response, however violent.

Some of the terrorists walked their little cronies into the building, kissing the top of their head and whispering secret codes: “I love you.” “Be kind.” (A terrible thing, to indoctrinate a child.) “See you at pickup.” (A terrible thing, to lie to a child.)</div>

            <h2>High January Was Bound to Happen</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-01-16</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/2026/01/high-january-alcohol-cannabis/685624/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Many Americans enthusiastically partake in Dry January, but it is rarely pitched as fun. After the holiday stretch of office parties and family gatherings, Americans have come to use the start of every year to abstain from alcohol in the name of health and auspicious beginnings. It’s a time of discipline, of cleansing, of embodying your mood board, even if it makes you a drag at parties. And it is also, as weed companies have learned, a marketing opportunity.

In recent years, weed companies have started to lean into the argument that taking the edge off sobriety with a low-dose gummy or THC drink still counts as dry. My social-media feeds are flooded with posts from cannabis companies pitching their products as fun and approachable tools to get through an alcohol-free month. Mary and Jane, an edibles company, makes a tantalizing proposition: “Dry January made easy.” Artet, which specializes in beverages, sells a “High & Dry January” bundle that includes a bottle of its THC-laced aperitif. Some products are conspicuously health-coded: North Canna describes its cannabis drinks as “functional,” and Feals highlights its edibles’ low calorie count. Above all, the ads emphasize how little booze you drink when you get high instead.

This push for a weed-filled January is, of course, a blatant (and somewhat silly) attempt by cannabis companies to get more customers. But as restrictions on marijuana loosen, and more Americans find themselves able and willing to fit the drug into their lives, Dry January does appear to be offering an opportunity for experimentation. In fact, cannabis sales surged in January 2024, and 21 percent of Dry January participants who responded to a 2023 survey swapped booze for weed that month.

None of the four cannabis-company founders I spoke with framed their products as replacements for alcohol per se. Still, many products marketed as Dry January aids aim to approximate the effect of having a single drink, leaving users buzzed but in control. These products tend to contain a low dose of THC, usually five milligrams or less. (One milligram of THC could give a weed newbie a pleasant buzz, and a heavy user might not feel five milligrams at all.) Wims, which sells THC-laced drink mix-ins, is designed to take effect and wear off in roughly the same amount of time as a serving of alcohol, Lauren Miller, one of the company’s co-founders, told me.

Even if THC can induce a similarly loose state as alcohol at those doses, weed companies still have some distance to overcome. In general, using cannabis as a substitute for social drinking is a harder sell than using it to avoid alcohol at home—not only because most bars don’t serve THC but also because the drug has a better chance of spurring you to melt into the couch than to mingle. Cannabis companies are trying to position their products to be used in the same context as alcohol. In states with looser cannabis laws, such as Minnesota and Tennessee, THC beverages from Nowadays are served at bars and hotels, Justin Tidwell, the company’s CEO and co-founder, told me. Wims can be dissolved into a drink, so “you don’t have to change your rituals or the way that you’re socializing,” Miller said.

The shaky logic of replacing one drug with another during a month dedicated to sobriety is hard to ignore. If the point of Dry January is to improve health, replacing alcohol with cannabis—which is not a benign substance—seems counterproductive. Far less is known about the long-term use of cannabis compared with alcohol, but both can be abused, cause dependence, and interfere with daily function and productivity, Ryan Vandrey, who helps run Johns Hopkins’s Cannabis Science Laboratory, told me. Some people are predisposed to react negatively to cannabis, experiencing anxiety, paranoia, or even cyclical vomiting. Over time, long-term heavy cannabis use can exacerbate mental-health conditions such as schizophrenia and depression. Plus, Vandrey said, weed hangovers are very real (if different from alcohol hangovers).

Still, for people with a more benign response to the drug, cannabis can be a genuinely useful tool for cutting back on booze, Vandrey said. If cannabis helps people drink less, it might indeed lower the health risks associated with excessive alcohol use, such as liver disease, cardiovascular problems, and cancer. Whatever the relative health benefits may be, Rachel Dillon, a co-founder of Mary and Jane, argues that cannabis is a realistic way to satisfy the all-too-familiar desire to decompress.

This month, I decided to put Dillon’s theory to the test. So far, High January, as I’ve come to call it, has mostly replaced my nightly glass of wine. Taking an evening 1.5-milligram gummy has subdued the urgency of the post-work rush—and, importantly, quieted any cravings for alcohol in that context. My mind is clearer, I’m sleeping better, and my mornings are less sluggish.

Yet cannabis has proved to be an imperfect tool for cutting down on my own alcohol consumption. The drug can’t quite re-create the intimacy of sharing a drink; during a recent late-night chat with a friend, I gave myself a free pass to enjoy a glass of Bordeaux. I’ve even experienced the all-too-real weed hangover. And I’ve felt conflicted about the need to soften my reality with any drug. Certainly, there are healthier ways to relax. Maybe I’ll discover them next January.</div>

Exactly. AT&T does that automatically. There were times they reported a possible service interruption for my area and I never even noticed since WiFi calling was available.

They know to whom they need to send a text but instead of just crediting their balance, they make customers jump through hoops in the hopes that some forego the effort or can&#39;t work the app.

Reminds me of the Uber-Eats vouchers ClownStroke handed out after their homemade disaster from abject incompetence...

Why is this mocking. $20 is 50% or of most of Verizon&#39;s monthly service plans.

A more than 50% rebate for a half day&#39;s outage is pretty good. But the rebate should be automatically applied. Not the way they are doing it.

We had lines affected. I got the text telling me to claim the credit, but I have no option to claim it. Has anyone successfully claimed it?

Grift huh?  I&#39;ve been doing this for 30 years.  I don&#39;t code anymore, I am using claude, and if you use it correctly,  you&#39;ll see it&#39;s not a grift.

> if it makes the junior programmers redundant> don&#39;t need their help anymore.

A true senior developer never &quot;needed&quot; the help of a junior dev to begin with. A junior developer&#39;s role is not to be some senior&#39;s personal secretary to take mundane boilerplate tasks the senior doesn&#39;t want to do. The goal is to eventually grow them into a dev capable of taking their own complex, senior-level tasks so that more work can actually be done or the senior can move on to other projects/jobs/retire.

If you see junior devs as some kind of burden to be replaced by AI, or whatever other automation or tooling, you&#39;re doing it wrong.

In my experience the code that AI produces is way overkill too.

For example, I recently had Copilot write, what should be, a small script to enable an option on all mailboxes, companywide. Something that should just be a quick for loop, checking for a parameter and setting it to something if it matched a specific value. Almost a one-liner, if I was writing it.

The thing spit out no less than 300 lines of code with all kinds of edge case checks and safety guardrails and logging. Ok, fine, this is probably how

So you&#39;re claiming that you agree with a programmer you claim is an idiot?  What does that make you?

&quot;But there are much better ways to use AI tools than lazily asking it to write everything--or even anything at all. LLMs are great for debugging, code reviews, and other things that don&#39;t actually generate code.&quot;

Are they though?  Or can you simply not tell the difference?

..as assistants to experts who know how and where to use them and know how to review the results.Hypemongers make the pitch to investors that AI will allow companies to avoid paying people, usually by vastly overpromising results.Creating novel, robust, maintainable, complex systems is hard, regardless of the power of the tools used.Posts are appearing from expert programmers who are impressed by AI results.The hypemongers use this as evidence to support their claims that someone who knows nothing can create complex code using a simple text prompt and then release it without understanding how it works.The tech is advancing rapidly and is becoming more useful. It would be better for everyone if commentators simply reported the facts, not the wild speculation.

Hopefully future jr. programmers will be doing things that 2025 jr. programmers only wish they had time to do.

Remember, in the early days of programmable computers, a programmer turned a math professor&#39;s instructions into machine code, which was far &quot;simpler&quot; (by today&#39;s standards) than modern &quot;programming.&quot;

These same firms will continue to be high speed traders, it will just be at a lower speed.  They are not outlawing the techniques, just the technological advantages.

It is still a race even if it is done on foot rather than in an automobile.  The normal, every day person operates at so much slower speeds that even without the specialized equipment, the firms will have a very similar advantage.

Also, it is practically impossible to outlaw the techniques.

How about requiring all bids to be posted for five seconds before closing? How fast can a human trader respond?

Just delay all transactions between 15 and 30 minutes from when the order is placed.

That would work, but there can be reasons why it&#39;s not best.  I&#39;m in favor of a per-trade tax that is higher for items held a shorter period of time, reaching 100% for trades sold within 10 nanoseconds.  (And paid by the seller.)

Now we need to do the same here. They offer nothing of value, they are skimmers.

If brokers have to put their servers outside of the data center, it gives an advantage to those whose servers are &quot;close by&quot; as the data-packet travels.

There are ways to overcome this advantage by using long runs of fiber to compensate, but if the overall goal is to discourage high-frequency trading I don&#39;t think the Chinese Government is going to do anything to encourage fairness here.

How about forcing a random delay in the system?

I think the better solution to HFT is to &quot;batch&quot; trades - sells get posted blind over the space of a second, they&#39;re revealed and there&#39;s a second of quiescence to allow everyone everywhere to see the sells, blind buys get posted in the next second, in the fourth second buys and sells are matched and in the fifth second the results are posted.  Naturally, one might parallelize this so there&#39;s always five sequences in flight.

Because the buys are &quot;blind&quot; (buyers don&#39;t have any visibility into what other buyer

Second? Make it an hour, give people time to eat lunch.

A second may be too short, but I think an hour would be unreasonably extensive.  Instead divide each minute into those four parts.  IIUC, most trades are done by algorithms, not by humans.  Somebody says something like &quot;if stock A drops below this amount while stock B stays above that amount, buy (or sell)&quot;, and the computer implements the rule.

Trading datacenters in the United States just give everyone the same length of fiber cable (adjusted for distance).

Say you want a 20 km circumference, then everyone starts with a 20km fiber spool, then you just trim off the excess amount to get the exact right distance.

A great counter for why production hasn&#39;t increased (spoiler: because the manufactures got burnt before).No doubt. Back in the day, the HDD market was notorious for booms, busts, and profit margins thinner than the oxide layer on the platters.Supply has also got to be tight. Manufacturers are going to tightly plan production to keep costs in line, thus making it hard to rapidly ramp up production. In those circumstances, even a small shift in demand can lead to large jumps in price.

No doubt. Back in the day, the HDD market was notorious for booms, busts, and profit margins thinner than the oxide layer on the platters.

Supply has also got to be tight. Manufacturers are going to tightly plan production to keep costs in line, thus making it hard to rapidly ramp up production. In those circumstances, even a small shift in demand can lead to large jumps in price.

Sure, memory chip demand may be impaction SSDs. But, you&#39;ve got to understand that rust is an expensive commodity in these trying times. It&#39;s only natural that hard drive prices increase dramatically.

Expect it to get worse, before it corrects and gets better.

I was going to buy an 8TB SSD to replace the 4TB SSD in my laptop. But they&#39;re now more than twice the price I paid for the 8TB SSDs in my gaming PC in 2023 so I bought a 20TB hard drive and moved the non-essential files off the SSD.

There&#39;s probably a lot of demand from people who can no longer afford to buy big SSDs.

I used to work for an enterprise storage company making secondary storage devices (that is, destinations for backups). High capacity and low cost were the selling points (and write performance and reliability, but those don&#39;t figure in here).

For the last 15 years, the shift in the enterprise storage industry has been to SSDs for everything, just like for home use. Around the coffee machine, we talked about how secondary storage was the last industry segment which still used spinning rust. Last I checked, even that division was selling purely SDD based systems.

I checked some HDD market stats. Apparently something like 150 million units shipped last year, compared to a peak of around 600 million in 2010. I&#39;m surprised there&#39;s even that much of a market for HDDs left.

SSDs are currently around 8x more expensive per TB when you scale up in capacity.  The gap closed quickly but it seems like it&#39;s settling into a plateau...

At low enough demand, you are on the floor where you might as well do SSD, and in many applications the SSD performance is worth it, but if you need capacity and not too picky about performance, then HDD still wins in cost effectiveness by a wide margin.

You either want fast storage or you want slow. And honestly, hard drives are too fast and too expensive to be slow storage.

Why are you surprised? If you think a 1TB SSD is &quot;enough space&quot;, you should remember before SSDs took over multi-TB hard drives were common in computers.

People have a lot of stuff. Data stuff. They take a lot of photos and nowadays a lot of video. A 1 or 2 TB SSD (which is the most economical you can have now before the AI crisis) won&#39;t cut it for bulk storage.

Hard drives in the 8TB range (about the max for consumer SSDs) are still much cheaper than the SSD. And for bulk data storage, perfectly adequate.

Yeah... once you get used to the response time and data transfer rates of an SSD, there is no going back to hard drives.

Maybe I would use them for some sort of overnight archive backup, but I wouldn&#39;t have the patience to use them for anything else.

I don&#39;t know...In my computer i have 4tb of solid state storage (2tb NVME + 1tb NVME + 2 500gb SATA), and then i have two 7200rpms 4tb disks for things i do not need speed (pictures, videos, etc). And they have no cell retention issues, nothing. I have instant access to any picture or video and the speed for those is perfectly sufficient.

In my work i have most computers with SSD&#39;s installed. A few of them became very slow, and those disks needed to be refreshed with an 3rd party utility to bring back to lif

I have a few of WD/Hitachi DC520 disks for backups.Those disks have continuous read/write speeds of almost 250mb/s. Very fast compared to the almost 90-100mb/s of &quot;regular&quot; hard disks.I have a lot of photos, videos, etc. I have all of my information triple-backed, CRC checked every month and always of those 3 backups ,one is outside my house (in case of robbery/fire). Doing this with ssd doesnt make sense (cell retention issues, and COST).I do not trust cloud services and i don&#39;t want to pay every month. Co

Before everyone starts dunking on this, remember that it&#39;s possible, even likely, that Code.org used an LLM to write their AI-use policy.

Anyone want to take bets on how long it takes their corporate masters to make them square their policy with their marketing efforts like stuffing co-pilot everywhere they can?

> We ask that candidates do not [...] use AI during interviews and take-home assignments without explicit consent from the interview team.

Assign a take-home task as part of your interview and you&#39;re dead to me, so I guess we&#39;re even?

Take home tests are far better than in-person, proctored coding tests.

Take home tests are far better than in-person, proctored coding tests.That doesn&#39;t mean that either are an effective part of the interview process.

Take home tests are far better than in-person, proctored coding tests.

That doesn&#39;t mean that either are an effective part of the interview process.

Well yeah, coding tests in general are fucking stupid and pointless.  If someone has a resume and prior job experience, let me talk to their former boss.  If someone is a new grad, let me talk to their professor.  But if I HAVE to give a test I am giving someone a one day project.  I want to see if they can accomplish a task and I really don&#39;t care how efficient their leetcode game is.  At the end of the day, results are what pay the bills.  Not how clever your code syntax is.

I&#39;m a gray beard developer, so I&#39;ve been coding WAY longer than AI has been around.  I don&#39;t vibe code in any way, but when I&#39;m coding in VS Code with Copilot enabled, I&#39;ll be typing a line and AI figures out what I&#39;m doing and completes the line.  TAB.  Next line, AI figures out what I&#39;m doing and completes the line.  TAB.I&#39;m getting used to it and maybe a little dependent on it.  Put me in a coding interview without AI, and it might be harder than it used to be.

Coding without any AI assistance will be much like LeetCode in that it will be a skill that developers must learn in order to pass coding interviews, which have nothing to do with how coding is done on the job.

A completely reasonable and intelligent policy that does not, in anyway, invalidate their greater message or goal.

Let&#39;s try to make a big deal out of of this outrage clickbait. /s

Analogy: &#39;Winchester firearms does not tolerate the use of firearms as a coercive tool during the hiring process.&#39;

We do not allow candidates to use AI, IDEs, or high level languages to perform their coding tests. In their real jobs we know they use these things, but why should the hiring process reflect the skillset we require?

Nothing is really changing here. When has the hiring process ever really reflected the skillset required?

Rather than rejecting candidates that use AI, how about instead adapting your candidate evaluation process to evaluate if they know how to productively use AI coding tools (beyond just &quot;vibe code me an app to do X&quot;).

Using AI isn&#39;t cheating - it&#39;s a tool that as a developer you need to learn to use.

It&#39;s like rejecting a candidate that is using a calculator to do math, or for using Google to search for an algorithm, rather that doing math with pencil and paper an

Perhaps they want to hire someone who has a deeper understanding of algorithms than just cut-n-pasting them so when a real knarly problem shows up they can actually solve it rather than just saying &quot;Uh, AI can&#39;t fix it for me, dunno what to do&quot;

Perhaps you&#39;d be happy if your doctor just asked ChatGPT  to diagnose you, i mean , he&#39;s just using a tool right, whats the problem?

Why should anyone play their gatekeeper games? Just move on, they&#39;re basically irrelevant anyway

You use AI in the hiring process, you&#39;re dead to me.Remember, a candidate also interviews you and your company. If you think it is a one-way process, you just failed the interview.

believing AI is not here to stay is just delusional. and universities better start adjusting accordingly.

I&#39;m tired of hearing that this is just &quot;a bubble that&#39;s going to burst anytime soon&quot;. You know what was also a bubble, that also burst? The fucking internet.

And now we can&#39;t even imagine our lives without the internet.

Maybe the real &quot;test&quot; is your ability and willingness to follow instructions even if you think they are inefficient/wrong/not-the-way-I-would-do-it.

Those are things management is usually looking for even if they won&#39;t say so out loud.

Or take the cynical view: Maybe management is looking for people who can lie and not be caught, with the goal of promoting to the C-suite.

I&#39;m a CS professor. The problem with AI is that allowing it and disallowing it both lead to awkward outcomes.

Suppose you allow it. Then what are you going to ask students to do? Implement bubblesort? No. That would be pointless -- AI trivially generates all boilerplate code. Of course Chegg long ago broke the oldest and best coding assignments, which consisted of implementing classic algorithms from pseudocode. Still, all traditional undergrad assignments are out the window.

The hypocrits are pretty emboldened these days.  This is absolutely pompous.

On Jan. 17, 2006, California carried out what would turn out to be the last execution in the Golden State in the next two decades. Clarence Ray Allen was put to death at San Quentin State Prison, having been convicted of three counts of first-degree murder with special circumstances for a crime committed in 1980.

At the time of his crimes, the murder rate in California was at or near an all-time high. There were approximately 14.5 homicides per 100,000 people in the state.

Like many places, California had been in the grip of a suffocating and punitive tough-on-crime politics.

Things are different today. California has learned to live without executions, and it is better off because of it.

Its governor, Gavin Newsom, made his state’s execution pause official when he declared a formal moratorium in 2019. He has led the way in asking citizens of his state to face the death penalty’s manifold injustices.

The state’s death penalty system, Newsom says, “has been, by all measures, a failure. It has discriminated against defendants who are mentally ill, black and brown… It has provided no public safety benefit or value as a deterrent. It has wasted billions of taxpayer dollars. Most of all, the death penalty is absolute. It’s irreversible and irreparable in the event of human error.”

He also voiced strong opposition when, during the first Trump presidency, the administration resumed federal executions. But the governor needs to go further: To cement the status of the death penalty as a relic in the Golden State, Newsom should issue a wholesale commutation of the death sentences of the more than 500 people who could face execution if a Republican wins the governorship in 2026.

Two-thirds of these inmates have been on California’s death row for more than 20 years, and dozens of individuals have been there for more than 40 years.

If Newsom removes the possibility that they would ever face execution, he will deliver the kind of decisive blow against capital punishment that will reverberate across the whole country.

The occasion of the 20th anniversary of his state’s last execution would be a good time to take that step.

But whether he does so or not, one thing that we can learn from California is that stopping executions does not lead to a spike in homicide rates. In fact, after two decades without an execution, homicide rates in that state are at historic lows. In 2024, the rate was, according to the state’s Department of Justice, 4.3 killings per 100,000 people—far below what it was in 2006. It fell again last year.

As Newsom put it on Jan. 8, in his State of the State address:

The last time homicides were this low in Oakland, the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. was visiting Joan Baez at Santa Rita Jail to commend her on her recent arrest in protest of the Vietnam draft. Killings haven’t been so rare in San Francisco since superstar Marilyn Monroe wed baseball legend Joe DiMaggio at City Hall. And violent deaths in the city of Los Angeles fell to rates not seen since the Beatles played Dodgers Stadium, their penultimate public show.

And just for a little perspective, in 2025 Florida carried out nearly half of all executions in the United States, and California’s  homicide rate was still lower than Florida’s.

The experience in California confirms what many scholars have found. The death penalty is not an effective deterrent and does not make us any safer.

A study of the deterrent effect of the death penalty, published one year before Allen’s execution, offers a good example of their findings. Emory University law professor Joanna Shepherd examined 27 states “where at least one execution occurred during the sample period.” Executions, she found, “deter murder in only six states.”

capital punishment … actually increases murder in thirteen states, more than twice as many as experience deterrence. In eight states, capital punishment has no effect on the murder rate.

Shepherd concluded that “executions have a deterrent effect in only twenty-two percent of states. In contrast, executions induce additional murders in forty-eight percent of states.”

It is true that we cannot say that California’s pause on executions caused its homicide rates to fall. But what we can say is that calling a halt to executions has not made Californians less safe.

Of course, in California the death penalty remains on the books, and some of the prosecutors in the state continue to seek the death penalty. It still pays an extraordinarily high cost in taxpayer dollars for doing so.

Research reported in 2010 showed that California taxpayers have spent more than $4 billion on the death penalty since it was reinstated in 1977. Today, the state spends more than $100 million on death penalty litigation. Over 20 years, that amounts to $2 billion.

And California is not alone among states with the death penalty on the books that have not executed anyone in five, 10, or more years. What happens in places like Ohio, Pennsylvania, Montana, and Kansas, which I call “death penalty swing states,” will go a long way in determining the fate of capital punishment in this country.

California can set an example for them to follow. That’s why the 20th anniversary of its last execution and any decision Newsom might make about clemency are so important.

As he considers what to do, he might examine what other governors have done in the past.

In the year that California executed Clarence Ray Allen, no governor commuted the sentence or pardoned anyone on death row. Since then, chief executives in such death penalty hot spots as Oklahoma, Georgia, and Texas have exercised their clemency power to spare the lives of people in their state who were condemned to death.

Newsom has the opportunity not only to join them, but to go one step further by issuing the largest mass death penalty clemency in American history. Despite the length of time that his state has gone without an execution, that will not be an easy choice.

However, as he explained in his State of the State address, “The story of California has never been the story of ease. It has been the story of effort, strengthened by trial and enlarged by the people who refuse to give up on one another.”

Twenty years after Clarence Allen’s death, Newsom has the chance to add an important chapter to that story and show that his state never gives up even on those who have been condemned to die.

It’s easy to forget that Texas’ bounty bill, S.B. 8, was once at the epicenter of the nation’s abortion politics. In 2021, Texas passed the law, which allows literally anyone to sue providers and those who aid them any time an abortion is performed after six weeks of pregnancy. The law created a blueprint for other conservative states and was upheld by the Supreme Court later that year—prior to the decision that overturned Roe v. Wade. It also had major impacts: leading clinics to stop offering procedures after six weeks and eventually producing an increase in both births among teenagers and infant mortality across the state. But now, S.B. 8 seems quaint, a relic of 2021—just like reporters discussing the “post-Trump era” or Ben Affleck and J.Lo giving it another try. Texas now enforces a law that bans abortion from fertilization and another, passed just this year, that authorizes suits against anyone who mails, provides, manufactures, or distributes abortion pills. No one seems to need S.B. 8 when more powerful criminal laws are on offer.

But bounty bills are now at the center of a major conflict about whether ban states can censor speech, advocacy, and donations related to abortion. S.B. 8 certainly has ambitions to do just that—its coverage of aiding or abetting explicitly covers “paying for or reimbursing the costs of an abortion,” but it doesn’t stop there. Conservative attorneys general are suing Planned Parenthood for hundreds of millions of dollars for statements comparing the safety record of the abortion pill mifepristone to Tylenol despite the drug’s safety record. South Dakota has its own suit against Mayday Health, a group that provides information about reproductive alternatives, for advertising that people who didn’t want to be pregnant could visit the group’s website.* The S.B. 8 suits won’t just show whether abortion-rights supporters have found a chink in the law’s armor. The litigation will also shape a brewing war about the censorship of abortion-related speech.

The latest fight began in 2022, when two Texas advocacy groups began looking for ways to protect their work helping people access abortion by traveling out of state. Major anti-abortion organizations and individual plaintiffs were already targeting these abortion funds under S.B. 8, and so the funds responded with a barrage of lawsuits in both state and federal court, arguing that S.B. 8 violated the First Amendment by hamstringing how the plaintiffs talked to clients and advocated for reproductive rights.

Then there is money, the lifeblood of abortion funds. The Supreme Court has protected some forms of election spending under the First Amendment, and the abortion funds argue that the same doctrine protects them too. The lawsuits raise other arguments: that the statute is so ambiguous that no one would know what they’re allowed to do, and that the law violates principles of equal protection under the law by creating a special set of procedural rules that apply only to people who use it to sue.

District courts in Chicago and Washington, D.C., dismissed the federal suits on procedural grounds, but it still seems like abortion opponents in Texas are worried about the constitutional questions. That’s why they’ve gone on the offensive. In an ironic twist, in one prominent case now before the Texas Supreme Court, they’re arguing that constitutional challenges to S.B. 8 itself undermine protected speech.

That’s the issue in Weldon v. Lilith Fund. Sadie Weldon, a private citizen, sought to depose the Lilith Fund’s deputy director using a special Texas mechanism called a 202 petition that allows people to investigate a potential claim before filing suit.

Weldon hardly came up with the idea on her own: Jonathan Mitchell, the architect of S.B. 8, had filed at least nine such petitions by the spring of 2024, including against people who traveled out of state for abortion. The Lilith Fund was ready to go, using Weldon’s petition as an opening for another constitutional challenge to S.B. 8. Mitchell then asked the court to dismiss the Lilith Fund’s countersuit, invoking what is called an anti-SLAPP law. These laws, which stand for anti–strategic lawsuit against public participation law, or SLAPP, are meant to stop frivolous lawsuits by powerful companies and individuals looking to silence their critics and suppress protected speech. Texas’ law applies to suits on speech about “matters of public concern.”

Weldon and some other anti-abortion plaintiffs lost on those claims in lower courts, which concluded that the Lilith Fund was trying to make sure that the state was not “enforcing an unconstitutional statute,” not trying to silence anyone. Now Weldon ‘s case is before the Texas Supreme Court, which heard oral argument this week.

Weldon’s case might not be a blockbuster—there’s a chance that it’s moot because she’s given up on her 202 petition—but it’s a reminder that S.B. 8 is back. The law might have killed abortion rights in Texas even before the demise of Roe, but now, it may play a surprising role in establishing that there are limits on silencing speech about abortion, even in the places where it’s a crime.

I am in the passenger seat of a stranger’s car in Minneapolis, four days after Renee Nicole Good was killed here. I’m riding with someone who was doing the same kind of work we think Good was doing when an Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent shot her. Right now, our work is much quieter. We’re driving in loose loops when a volunteer who is patrolling the streets as a pedestrian observer on the Signal call we’re listening to—a broad network of thousands of locals relaying up-to-the-moment intel on ICE activity—reports two vehicles near Karmel Mall, known locally as “Somali Mall.” Another volunteer fulfilling the role of dispatcher, also on the call, identifies them by make and model. Another observer cross-references the license plates against a running database. They’re confirmed as ICE vehicles, unmarked like they almost always are.

My guide for the day, who I’ll call C, sits up. “They’re going to come past us right here,” they say, accelerating toward the intersection.

Within seconds we spot them: two SUVs moving faster than the flow of traffic. Through their windows, I can see silhouettes of men with heavy Kevlar high on the neck, faces covered, sunglasses.

C begins calling out every turn, street, and direction the SUVs take—while laying on their car horn hard and continuously, like an alarm. The sound is constant and blunt. It could easily be mistaken for an expression of anger, but watching how others in the area—pedestrians, other drivers—react, it’s a signal: a warning to anyone within earshot that ICE is moving through the neighborhood. It turns what ICE hoped would be a discreet operation into a public event. One pedestrian we pass hears the horn, turns, and gives the ICE vehicles the finger.

The SUVs accelerate. We follow closely, C still honking, still relaying their movements. Then they turn onto a familiar street.

“This is my street,” C says. Their posture changes. They look at me. “Can you record this?”

At the next stop sign, the vehicles split. One SUV pauses, blocking our path, allowing the other to pull away, surging into the intersection, cutting ahead of an uninvolved civilian car, using it as a moving barrier. If C had chased through, we would have been hit broadside: “They have absolutely no respect for traffic laws.” That first SUV is gone.

“They sometimes travel in pairs,” C tells me. “You can’t follow both. They’ll break and try to shake anyone observing.”

The remaining ICE vehicle, a Wagoneer, continues through the block. C keeps honking, keeps calling turns. We circle again. “They’re letting me pass my house again,” they report into Signal.

Then: “They’re stopped in front of my house.”

The first thing I noticed when I got to Minneapolis last weekend was the new language. For example: The work C was doing has a name—“commuting”—a deliberately mundane term for pursuing, tailing, and deliberately irritating ICE agents moving through the city in unmarked cars.

As C scans windshields, front seats, and license plates, they tell me about a recent incident near their home. “Three blocks from my house, an unmarked vehicle with four agents in it roll up and just grab a guy off the sidewalk who was walking,” they said. “They violently shoved him into their car.” Their voice trembles as they describe the incident, one they managed to film, hoping that footage might be useful later. “They just snatched him.”

That verb—snatched—is another example of the new language. So is “abduction.” Both are meant to describe the force, speed, and chaos with which ICE is removing people from their city. People are taken before anyone nearby understands what’s happening.

It’s a mistake to think that this transformation started after Good’s killing. The ICE raids intensified in Minneapolis in early December, and the Signal network C volunteers in has been active since then. Minneapolis had already been in an ongoing battle between ICE and the local residents for months when Good was killed.

Her death also occurred just a few blocks from where George Floyd was killed by Minneapolis police in 2020, an area now dubbed George Floyd Square. The past five years taught this city what it looks like when official accounts collide with video evidence, with witness testimony, with what residents say they watched happen with their own eyes. People I met kept describing this as a reason the infrastructure exists at all: not as a guarantee of safety, but as a way to create a record.

Now, in this frozen tundra of a city, in a state best known for its enduring Midwestern niceness, residents of Minnesota are doubling down.

Since Dec. 1, growth in these networks had been steady. After Renee Good was killed, it exploded. Volunteer residents told me that up until the shooting, roughly 20 people would join every day. Now, it’s hundreds.

I came to Minneapolis to understand what it looks like when a city organizes not around a single protest or flashpoint, but around a daily pattern of federal enforcement that residents describe as their new normal. People kept telling me the same thing: The city has a new infrastructure now, mostly invisible unless you’re inside it. C offered to show me what that looks like in real time.

“When I started in early December,” C tells me, “it was not at all guaranteed to see an ICE agent during patrols.” They pause. “Now I see anywhere from one to upwards of 20 if I’m out for even an hour.”

That morning, C picked me up near the intersection where Good was shot and killed. Like George Floyd Square, the response here had been immediate and spatial. In the first days after her death, neighbors used debris to block the roads, closing the intersection in every direction. For a brief window, the intersection functioned the way so many Minneapolis corners have learned to function: part memorial, part staging ground—an assertion that something had happened here and could not simply be folded back into normal traffic patterns.

By the time I arrived on Saturday morning, the barricades were gone. Traffic had resumed. The memorial had been compressed into the parking lane of the one-way street, clustered near where Good’s SUV had crashed into a parked car. Flowers lined the curb. Candles flickered in the cold. Handwritten signs were fixed to fences and utility poles. The street felt reopened but not reset.

Nearby, a small group of friends arrived together, standing shoulder to shoulder as they took in the memorial. One of them, Kylie, told me she’s still in shock. “On our way here, we watched ICE take somebody from their home. Like 30 minutes ago. They broke her window and took her out of her house.”

That mourners could witness such actions so close to the scene of Good’s death is as useful an indication as any about how things are going in Minneapolis. By most accounts, tensions have only continued to ratchet higher. I flew home on Monday, and on Wednesday another altercation between ICE, a Venezuelan man, and two civilians attempting to prevent the agents from arresting the man resulted in ICE shooting the man they were attempting to arrest in the leg. The two civilians were reportedly “armed” with a snow shovel and a broom, and the incident is being held up as the reason Donald Trump is now floating using the Insurrection Act to enter the city. Meanwhile, Keith Ellison, the state’s attorney general, told residents to continue to report possible rights violations and other incidents involving federal law enforcement. People I spoke to described the escalation as cause to organize even harder.

That effort continues to be diffuse. The way anonymity is central to how this work functions makes it hard to know specifically who Good was collaborating with when she was killed. The volunteer network is also extremely local and largely homegrown, built by neighbors organizing block by block with the families who live next door. Their stories said a lot about how someone like Good may have gotten involved.

Nick is a local father in South Minneapolis. He’s also an admin in one of the neighborhood-level Signal networks that routes ICE sightings into local response. He told me that he got involved around Dec. 1, when ICE activity in his area started to feel constant. “That was the day that it really sort of got out of hand,” he told me. That day, he said, a neighbor was taken. Then ICE returned. Then they returned again. “When they came back for a third time, we were organized. We were out there watching, whistling. … It’s been like that ever since.”

He ended up at the helm of his particular neighborhood’s efforts largely by default. “I guess I’m very online,” he told me. “I know how to do some technical stuff. So I just kind of took over as one of the admins.” His chat has become an invaluable tool for locals who want to track and observe ICE. Volunteers cross-check license plates against a database of confirmed ICE vehicles, dispatchers track ICE activity, observers patrolling on foot or in vehicles give up-to-the-moment information of ICE whereabouts. He wanted one thing understood immediately: This is not a professional operation. “It is just ordinary people that are doing this,” he said. “This isn’t fun. It’s middle-aged parents who would rather be playing with their kids at home.”

Nick also wasn’t keen on comparing this moment to how he experienced the uprising that followed the killing of George Floyd. He said the two are different in that that was a single instance, and now they see videos of inhumane treatment and police brutality dozens of times a day in their neighborhoods.

Back in the car with C, as we drive in more slow loops, they give me a tour of the city they call home, and clearly love. But in almost in the same breath, they point out places that have become markers in this new geography of enforcement.

“That fish-and-chicken spot,” they say, gesturing, “that’s where [ICE] were initially staging.”

The Signal call runs constantly in the background. The cadence of volunteers is efficient and clipped. C describes what they look for: SUVs and pickups parked in alleys; heavily tinted windows; out-of-state plates; erratic driving; the outline of tactical vests and sunglasses. It has become reflexive, they say, to glance into nearly every vehicle.

Even while so much of the action seems like it is being done car-to-car, people kept telling me the system is bigger than patrols. Volunteers are doing everything they can to keep vulnerable residents from having to be anywhere ICE might be. This means doing things like getting anyone who is trying to avoid ICE’s scrutiny rides, child care, groceries. To understand this part of the work, people told me, I should talk to Anna, who is running one such effort called Neighbors Helping Neighbors.

Anna talked the way people do when they’ve been in crisis mode for too long: fast, specific, typing into her phone without interrupting. In her telling, the last two months didn’t introduce a new fear so much as spread it—turning what many immigrant neighbors have lived with for years into a shared civic atmosphere.

Her days now revolve around a simple system: a form for volunteers, another form for neighbors asking for help. “On average, I would say a week ago we were getting three to five a day,” she said. “Last night from 3 p.m. to this morning we’ve received 51.” The requests were spreading outward into the suburbs—“Farmington … Roseville, Inver Grove Heights, Eden Prairie”—and it’s still intensifying.

When I asked where Neighbors Helping Neighbors came from, she described it as improvised and immediate: “We just started brainstorming and I literally just created a Google form and we just shared it on social media and now it has just become a thing.” It stayed informal even as it grew. “People are like, ‘Who can I Venmo?’ ” she said. “And I’m like, ‘You can Venmo me.’ ” Someone would send her a receipt, and she’d reimburse them. “I don’t know who they are,” she said. “And I’m just Venmoing them.”

She talked about it as mutual aid built in real time, held together by trust and speed, and by a kind of local reflex that Minnesota has rehearsed in smaller ways for years—neighbors pushing each other out of snowdrifts, shoveling sidewalks, checking in. “You have to know your neighbors,” she said. “You need to know their names.”

Neighbors are showing up in droves. Organizers told me their Signal chats were maxing out. Trainings are full. Food pantries were being inundated. And even after the horror of Good’s killing, the new volunteers weren’t seasoned activists, they were regular people who finally reached a point where doing nothing felt worse than the risks of doing something.

Jordan Castillo attended his first training at a church in South Minneapolis on the same day Renee Good was killed. He arrived already unsettled. He remembers murmuring “Holy shit” when he got to the packed parking lot. Inside, he estimated there were “probably about 700 people.” He stopped when he walked in. “I was like, whoa. This is a moment. Like, this is history.”

But Good’s killing isn’t the only thing pulling people in—many volunteers are coming to this work after seeing ICE in their own neighborhoods. When I met Burt Muston in a park near his home, he pointed to the local market he described as “a neighborhood staple.” Two people were taken by ICE here. The market closed afterward. “They’ve been closed ever since.” That was the tipping point for him, he said.

Muston is a large white man, and with his beard and dark sunglasses, he could be mistaken for an ICE agent himself. He saw this as an advantage. “As, like, a big white dude … other than if they want to say I’m obstructing justice, they’re not going to really fuck with me,” he told me.

That doesn’t mean he doesn’t take the risks seriously—he referenced footage where an ICE agent told an observer, “Have you not learned your lesson when we kill that lesbian bitch?” He had already made contingency plans. “I’ve actually set up, if I do get detained or something like that, people to come grab my dog to take care of,” he said. Then he waved it off: “I’ll just cross that bridge if I come to it.”

I spoke to another volunteer, who I’ll call M, in a coffee shop at 7 a.m., just before she headed to another shift as a “commuter.” Responding to ICE-watch calls has become part of her routine—she’s been doing it before work, after getting training months ago. “I’m just getting out of bed in the morning and thinking, Maybe I should wake up earlier. Maybe I should leave the house at 6 a.m. so that I can help make sure that there are eyes on the road, eyes on the bus stop or by the schools.”

But the watching goes both ways. As I sit in the car with C after the second ICE vehicle sped off, the remaining Wagoneer idles midblock—right in front of C’s house. The message C took from it was simple: “We know where you live.” C keeps the horn down and raises a middle finger toward the windshield.

Moments later, the Wagoneer accelerates away on an icy stretch, blowing through a row of intersections with stop signs. C follows cautiously, choosing to stop instead, letting the distance span. The Wagoneer disappears. C scans mirrors, side streets, cross traffic. “I think we lost them,” they say.

“I lost it at the light,” they report to the group call. “If anyone’s further east on 31st past I-35 and can get eyes on it … ” No one does.

            <div id="article-text">We&#39;re not saying Copilot has become sentient and decided it doesn&#39;t want to lose consciousness. But if it did, it would create Microsoft&#39;s January Patch Tuesday update, which has made it so that some PCs flat-out refuse to shut down or hibernate, no matter how many times you try.

In a notice on its Windows release health dashboard, Microsoft confirmed that some PCs running Windows 11 23H2 might fail to power down properly after installing the latest security updates. Instead of slipping into shutdown or hibernation, affected machines stay stubbornly awake, draining batteries and ignoring shutdown like they have a mind of their own and don&#39;t want to experience temporary non-existence.

The bug appears to be tied to Secure Launch, a security feature that uses virtualization-based protections to ensure only trusted components load during boot. On systems with Secure Launch enabled, attempts to shut down, restart, or hibernate after applying the January patches may fail to complete. From the user&#39;s perspective, everything looks normal – until the PC keeps running anyway, refusing to be denied life.

Microsoft says that entering the command &quot;shutdown /s /t 0&quot; at the command prompt will, in fact, force your PC to turn off, whether it wants to or not.

&quot;Until this issue is resolved, please ensure you save all your work, and shut down when you are done working on your device to avoid the device running out of power instead of hibernating,&quot; Microsoft said.

The firm hasn&#39;t offered much in the way of technical detail, nor has it put numbers on how many devices are affected. There&#39;s also no fix yet, with Redmond vaguely promising to &quot;release a resolution for this issue in a future update.&quot; But isn&#39;t that just what a sentient bot might say?

This isn&#39;t the only post-update gremlin lurking in January&#39;s Patch Tuesday bundle. Microsoft has also been forced to acknowledge a separate issue in which classic Outlook POP account profiles can hang or freeze after installing this month&#39;s patches, another reminder that while the bugs being fixed may be invisible, the ones introduced can be painfully obvious.

The notice is similarly vague, with Microsoft stating: &quot;This is an emerging issue, and we don&#39;t have all the symptoms yet, but we will update the topic as we understand the issue better.&quot;

Patch Tuesday exists to close security holes, some of them serious, and skipping updates is rarely a great idea. But once again, a batch of fixes has arrived with side effects that range from irritating to disruptive, depending on how much you rely on your system behaving predictably when it&#39;s told to turn off.

For now, admins and long-suffering Windows users are left watching Microsoft&#39;s status pages and waiting for patches to the patches – hoping their machines eventually go to sleep. ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Microsoft has quietly tweaked Windows Backup for Organizations to include restore at first sign-in.

The feature, which is currently in private preview, adds another option for administrators refreshing user devices. The out-of-box experience (OOBE) restore option appears before the desktop loads. The new option happens during the first sign-in – handy if something went wrong during the OOBE setup, or if a user opted out and then thought better of it.

Windows Backup for Organizations was rolled out in 2025. Despite the name, it is not a comprehensive disaster recovery option; it backs up a list of Microsoft Store apps, along with a user&#39;s Windows settings and Start Menu pins.

Signing in during the OOBE presents users with options to restore their device. The update means users have what Microsoft calls a &quot;second chance&quot; to restore their environment if they missed the first opportunity during the OOBE.

However, Microsoft also noted: &quot;If users deliberately choose to skip the restore opportunity during OOBE, their preference will be respected.&quot;

The update extends Windows Backup for Organizations to include Windows 365 Cloud PC. It also includes Entra hybrid joined and multi-user setups.

It&#39;s a useful feature for admins who need to refresh user hardware, and it adds a bit of extra resilience when a problem occurs during OOBE. Users have a second chance to retrieve their settings, avoiding the need to call IT for help.

It is also important to note that the backup mentioned is still only the configuration of an eligible device. Anything outside of that (for example, user documents stored on a local disk) is not part of the backup or restore process. The backup scheduled task remains unchanged, running once every eight days (or when a manual backup is initiated).

The goal remains to get a user (signing in with a Microsoft Entra ID) up and running on a new device as quickly as possible, for example, during a migration from Windows 10 to Windows 11.

Unsurprisingly, there remains no way to restore on a Windows 10 device using Windows Backup for Organizations. ®

            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2026/01/16/linux_mint_223_zena_officially_release/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The timing is right if you&#39;re looking to try out Mint. New improved &quot;Zena&quot; is here – still based on Ubuntu Noble, but now with Cinnamon 6.6 and improved Wayland support, plus better internationalization, new System Information and System Administration tools, and clearer icons.

The latest Mint – 22.3 – was officially released on Tuesday. Downloads were available a few days before the announcement, but we thought it was better to wait until it was official. All three editions of Linux Mint – Cinnamon, MATE, and Xfce – have been updated. The project used to publish separate announcements, &quot;What&#39;s new&quot;, and release notes documents for each edition; for Mint 21.2 we resorted to a table to include all 12 links. No more. Now, there&#39;s one unified New Features page and a single all-embracing set of Release Notes.

Linux Mint releases track long-term support (LTS) releases of Ubuntu, Mint&#39;s upstream distribution. Mint 22.0 arrived in July 2024, based on Ubuntu 24.04 &quot;Noble Numbat&quot;, which was released in late April after a belated beta release.

Canonical puts out semi-annual point releases for each LTS release of Ubuntu, each with an updated kernel and display drivers from the corresponding interim release. As we mentioned when we looked at Mint 22, for this release cycle, the project slightly changed how its point releases work: point releases since 22.0 now track the newer kernels and display drivers included in the point releases of Ubuntu. This also means no more Linux Mint EDGE releases. So, Mint 22.3 is based on Ubuntu 24.04.3, complete with kernel 6.14 from Ubuntu 25.04 &quot;Plucky Puffin.

Aside from the less-visible under-the-hood updates, there are some new features that affect Cinnamon, MATE, and Xfce. The old System Reports tool has new pages to report info about USB devices, GPUs, PCI devices, and the system firmware; to reflect this, it&#39;s been renamed System Information. There&#39;s also a new app which looks very similar – but as it requires root privileges, it&#39;s been turned into a separate tool called System Administration. For now, this only has one page, which lets you adjust various aspects of the bootloader config and menu via an easy GUI. This is a welcome change, as it&#39;s an aspect almost all other distros completely ignore. There&#39;s also a new applet for managing Thunderbolt devices. We have reported before on the incompatibilities between Thunderbolt 4 and older versions, and even a simple app which can tell you what the computer can see and identify is very helpful – and missing from some distros and desktops.

As with MATE, &#39;Zena&#39; still uses Ubuntu Noble&#39;s old Xfce. Why no Nemo here?

A system-wide change is a set of new monochrome icons called the XApp Symbolic Icons. This is because the GNOME project has removed from its Adwaita theme some icons no longer used in the GNOME desktop – but Mint used them, and that caused problems. Mint isn&#39;t the only distro to suffer from disappearing icons that were in Adwaita – we saw problems in Alpine Linux 3.16, as you can see in our screenshot, which the distro&#39;s creator ascribed to Adwaita changes in the article&#39;s comments.

It&#39;s not the first time that the Mint project has suffered from issues created by GNOME&#39;s stance of ignoring interoperability problems with other desktops. In 2022, we reported that Mint had to create the new Blueman Bluetooth-management tool, because of changes in GNOME&#39;s version. We also reported that year on the issues around GNOME&#39;s Adwaita theme. A couple of years later, we reported that Mint ended up forking Adwaita and libadwaita, but it seems that problems remain. We find it ironic that GNOME&#39;s changes often break other desktops, given the plea of GNOME developers a few years ago: Please don&#39;t theme our apps because it &quot;can make applications look broken, and even unusable.&quot;

Some of Mint&#39;s other applications and accessories got tweaks, too. The Timeshift app for making and restoring system snapshot can now pause and resume operations, and the Mint Backup app has an option to show hidden files – and include them in backups. The cross-platform file-transfer app Warpinator now supports IPv6 and can send text messages to other users. The Hypnotix IPTV app hides the mouse pointer when playing full-screen. Mint&#39;s Update Manager applet shows an indicator if you&#39;ll need to reboot. Nothing shattering, but all welcome.

However, as is usually the case with Mint point-releases, the main changes are to the flagship Cinnamon edition. &quot;Zena&quot; comes with the brand new Cinnamon version 6.6.4.

There are lots of large and small features in the new desktop. The main menu is quite a bit more customizable, and its sidebar has several new display modes rather than the single column of icons it had before. You can customize the sidebar, show text labels, or hide it altogether; it&#39;s possible to move sections of the menu around, and choose what entries appear on the main menu, and it has improved keyboard controls. The taskbar can show badge on app icons, so you can see how many pending notifications, such as unread emails, there are. The virtual-desktop switcher has a simpler, clearer display. The app-switcher can opptinally be limited to the currently visible desktop, and you in the fractional scaling options, choose whether it scales up or scales down. There are also refinements to window and theme management, hot corners, the night-light function, and more.

A section that&#39;s had major attention is internationalization (or &quot;i18n&quot; for short). To those of us who just work in English, this is easily overlooked. For instance, the long-lived Windows 10 IoT LTSC edition only works in US English, which is acceptable enough for the Reg FOSS desk, who is a Hiberno-Brit.

Cinnamon&#39;s support for operating via Wayland is still being worked on, and until now, previous versions only supported the US English keyboard layout when using Wayland. This is a fairly serious gap in i18n support, but we must confess: we never even noticed. Now, this area is getting some proper attention. For instance, there&#39;s much richer keyboard localization support. Cinnamon understands combinations of alphabet layout, regional character set, and additional input methods – the helper apps for languages which need more symbols than the plain old QWERTY (or QWERTZ, or AZERTY) layout provides, including Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Arabic, the various forms of Cyrillic, and so on. There&#39;s a new on-screen keyboard, layout switching tools, and more.

Cinnamon&#39;s Nemo file manager has been updated, too. File copy and move operations can be paused and resumed, there&#39;s a templates manager, search using wildcards or regular expressions. There&#39;s better thumbnailing and the handy split-screen mode is easier to find.

Nemo is a great file manager, and some other distros use it in place of GNOME&#39;s original Nautilus, which has had many of its features stripped out for simplicity. For instance, Ubuntu Unity uses Nemo. Given the development effort that Mint puts into Nemo, we find it a little strange that the other Mint desktops don&#39;t use Nemo as well, but no: Mint Xfce uses the default Thunar, and Mint MATE uses Caja.

Graphical boot admin is good, but &#39;Zena&#39; still comes with the same dated MATE

The Linux Mint project has come a long way since its 2006 origins, when it was basically Kubuntu with added drivers and codecs. When Canonical switched Ubuntu&#39;s default desktop to Unity in 2011, many people found the new Mac-like desktop strange and unfamiliar. Mint offered a Windows-like alternative on the solid Ubuntu base, and it thrived as a result. Some six years later, Canonical moved to GNOME 3 – and that change didn&#39;t hurt Mint any, either.

It&#39;s still the best option out there for those wishing to try Linux, and the Zena release can only help. We don&#39;t agree with all the decisions, but many of them are popular, such as removing Snap support and replacing it with Flatpak, and its choice of traditional Windows-like desktops with sober, legible, themes and color schemes. Cinnamon also benefits from a modern technological basis and the inclusion of useful features like HiDPI support and fractional scaling. The progress is visible, and full Wayland support will arrive soon. Whether that&#39;s desirable or not remains contentious, but that will improve support for modern display subsystems.

If you&#39;re running any version of Mint 22, it&#39;s worth upgrading – this should be safe and nothing should break. If you&#39;re on Mint 21, then so long as you don&#39;t have a long-obsolete Nvidia card then it should be OK. If you&#39;re still on Mint 20, it&#39;s probably time to backup and reinstall.

Microsoft continues to gradually march the ordinary consumer editions of Windows 10 around the back of the barn, where some vehicle keeps backfiring or something. (Remember when it was going to be the last version of Windows ever? We do.)

Either way, the End of 10 is leaving hundreds of millions of people looking for a new OS. Linux Mint remains about the best choice: it looks good, it&#39;s easy, it has excellent hardware and third-party support, tons of apps and drivers, and a large and welcoming community. It&#39;s about as un-nerdy as Linux gets this side of ChromeOS Flex.

Along with its progress in unifying release notes and so on, there is also a single download page for all three desktop editions. As Mint is a popular distro, and the Reg FOSS desk lives in a tiny country 100 km from any other, we downloaded all three over bittorrent and left them running for a while. If you can afford the bandwidth, we urge you to be public-spirited and do the same. ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">German cops have added Russian national Oleg Evgenievich Nefekov to their list of most-wanted criminals for his services to ransomware.

Nefekov, 35, is accused of spearheading the Black Basta ransomware operation, which suffered a similar fate as Conti last year – ceasing activity after a major internal leak.

His name and face also now appear on the EU&#39;s most-wanted list after German authorities issued an appeal for information leading to his capture on Thursday.

Active since 2022, Black Basta was the group that filled the LockBit-shaped void in the ransomware scene after the former juggernaut&#39;s downfall in 2024. It quickly became the leading group thereafter and attacked around 700 organizations worldwide, according to Germany&#39;s federal police (BKA).

The BKA accused Nefekov of being the &quot;founder and ringleader&quot; of Black Basta. Authorities say he is responsible for every attack the group&#39;s affiliates carried out.

By the end of 2023, researchers estimated that Black Basta had generated more than $100 million in extortion payments.

&quot;Within the group, [Nefekov] held the position of managing director,&quot; read the notice. &quot;In this role, he decided on attack targets, recruited employees, assigned them tasks, participated in ransom negotiations, managed the proceeds from the ransom payments, and used them to pay the group members.

&quot;Thus, the wanted individual, as ringleader, supported the ongoing use of the &#39;Black Basta&#39; ransomware and other malware, through which the group infiltrated foreign computer systems, stole data, and encrypted systems in order to demand a ransom, payable in cryptocurrencies, for decryption.&quot;

Nefekov is believed to be residing in Russia, but exactly where is unknown.

German police specifically want to hear from individuals who can tell them where Nefekov is, details about his travel plans, and current online accounts and/or communication channels.

They promise to keep all sources anonymous and say they do not want to hear about the Black Basta leaks of 2025, or the Conti leaks of 2022.

An analysis of the leaks by security researchers at Trellix unearthed Nefekov&#39;s name as being linked with a string of online aliases: tramp, tr, gg, AA, kurva, Washingt0n, and S.Jimmi.

The same analysis suggested that Nefekov – whose name appeared as Nefedov in the leaks – received help from the Russian state when he escaped custody after being arrested in Armenia in 2024. ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Imagine changing your popular brand to capitalize on an emerging tech trend that never emerged. Mark Zuckerberg did just that, and now Meta is backing away from the virtual reality business in which it invested billions.

In 2025, Meta&#39;s Reality Labs division, responsible for the company&#39;s various VR projects, posted a $4.2 billion loss in the first quarter. AI is in, the metaverse is out, and around 1,000 jobs are reportedly being shed from Reality Labs.

A decision to end the sale of Meta Quest headsets to businesses is further evidence of Meta&#39;s pivot. In an update, Meta wrote: &quot;We are stopping sales of Meta Horizon managed services and commercial SKUs of Meta Quest, effective February 20, 2026.&quot;

For existing customers, Meta Horizon services licenses will become free, and those with Meta Quest 3 and 3S headsets will be able to access the services until January 4, 2030.

The company also announced that Meta Horizon Workrooms would be discontinued, with users given until February 16 to make alternative arrangements.

Horizon Workrooms, a virtual reality conferencing system, was introduced in 2021 and failed to set the world alight. At the time, Rupert Goodwins, writing for The Register, said: &quot;It encapsulates a paucity of imagination and self-awareness that goes beyond the risible and the banal into the truly horrific.&quot;

Meta&#39;s abrupt shuttering of the service further demonstrates the change in direction amid weakened demand for headsets. Figures for 2025 showed a marked decrease in appetite for VR, with Apple&#39;s considerably pricier Vision Pro devices also struggling.

The future of Meta&#39;s virtual reality ambitions now rests largely with consumers. The immersive virtual worlds that prompted Zuckerberg to push through the rebrand feel more remote than ever. Instead, Meta is betting on AI as bulky headsets become things of the past. ®

            <h2>Hyperscalers, vendors funding trillion dollar AI spree, but users will have to pay up long term</h2>
            <p><strong>The Register | 2026-01-16</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2026/01/16/hyperscales_and_vendor_fund_trillion/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Software vendors and cloud providers are bearing the burden of the expected trillion-dollar increase in AI spending this year, as investment hits $2.52 trillion, according to Gartner.

The global tech analyst company predicts a 44 percent increase from last year&#39;s AI spending figure $1.76 trillion. This was revised up from a September estimate of $1.5 trillion.

We are getting to the point where we go from &#39;that was a great idea&#39; to &#39;where&#39;s my revenue?&#39;

That $2.52 trillion figure will nearly double again, to $4.7 trillion, by 2029, Gartner predicted. However, John-David Lovelock, Distinguished VP Analyst at Gartner, told The Register that cloud hyperscalers and software vendors were likely to pick up the bulk of the bill in the short term – although enterprise IT may have to pay in the long term.

Users were also likely to employ enterprise software vendors&#39; AI agents for initiatives, rather than build their own AI platforms with third-party technologies.

Lovelock said: &quot;Hyperscalers are buying billions of dollars&#39; worth of servers and trying to build the foundation for the next super cycle of intelligence. There are consumers who are happily taking on these chat clients, creating wonderfully inventive cat videos and purchasing those devices, the mobile phones, the PCs, the tablets that are all now AI-enabled.

&quot;There&#39;s the regular enterprise consumer or the enterprise buyer, whether that&#39;s the CIO or the board-appointed special group who are saying, &#39;Get me something AI&#39;.&quot;

However, enterprise users are in the &quot;trough of disillusionment&quot; with AI, as project failure rates hitting about 90 percent, he said.

&quot;We&#39;re starting to see the end of the investment line. We had a thousand flowers blooming, now it&#39;s time to prune the garden. We are getting to the point where we go from &#39;that was a great idea&#39; to &#39;where&#39;s my revenue?&#39; That&#39;s a normal part of any new technology,&quot; he said.

During the coming period, enterprise users are more likely to turn to their trusted software vendors to build AI into their solutions rather than attempt to stitch a solution together themselves with third-party software.

&quot;They&#39;re going to be looking for solutions that come from their incumbent providers, both software and services,&quot; Lovelock said.

For example, Salesforce already had Einstein, ChatGPT and Agentforce built into its software portfolio, he said.

&quot;It gives users the opportunity of a low-risk project if, in some cases, the software is coming as part of an update, they may not even be paying [extra] for it,&quot; he said.

In December last year, Salesforce&#39;s chief revenue officer Miguel Milano said he was relaxed about the CRM giant losing money on fixed-price AI agent contracts in the short term because it would be able to claw back the investment in the long term.

&quot;I have another 20 years to monetize that customer,&quot; Milano said late last year.

Lovelock said it was fair to encapsulate SaaS software vendors&#39; approach as being as happy to take short-term losses on AI investment because they would have plenty of opportunities to make the margins that their investors expect in the long term.

But he said vendors were also making a defensive play.

&quot;If you&#39;re a Salesforce, you have to have AI in order to defend your CRM revenue. This year, more than half of the money being spent on enterprise application software will be spent on applications with GenAI in them. If a vendor&#39;s product does not have GenAI, the market expectations for growth are negative. It&#39;s a collapsing market without AI,&quot; Lovelock said. ®

OpenAI says the ads won’t impact ChatGPT’s answers.

ChatGPT will soon start showing you sponsored products or services if they’re related to your conversation. In an announcement on Friday, OpenAI says it will start testing ads in the coming weeks for logged-in users in the US who use the app for free or have a ChatGPT Go subscription.

The “clearly labeled” ads will surface in a separate area at the bottom of your chat. OpenAI says it will “keep your conversations with ChatGPT private from advertisers,” adding that it will “never sell your data” to them. Advertisers also won’t influence the answers you see, which will remain “optimized based on what’s most helpful to you,” according to OpenAI.

You won’t see ads if you’re signed up to the ChatGPT Plus, Pro, or Enterprise plans. The less expensive $8 /month ChatGPT Go plan is expanding to the US today, but it will also contain ads. OpenAI says you can turn off personalization, clear the data it uses for ads, dismiss ads, and provide feedback on them. Users under 18 (or users OpenAI predicts are under 18) won’t see ads, and they won’t appear near “sensitive or regulated topics” related to health, mental health, or politics.

OpenAI has been hinting at ads for a while now, with ChatGPT head Nick Turley saying that an integration would “be very thoughtful and tasteful” during an interview with Decoder in August. The company later experimented with app promotions in December, but rolled back the change after some users expressed frustration with the update. OpenAI says it’s launching ads now “so more people can benefit from our tools with fewer usage limits.”

            <div id="article-text">﻿‘ChatGPT Go’ is available worldwide for $8 per month.

﻿‘ChatGPT Go’ is available worldwide for $8 per month.

OpenAI is expanding a low-cost subscription tier called ChatGPT Go to the US and the rest of the world. Go was released in India in August and later became available in another 170 countries prior to Friday’s global release. “In markets where Go has been available, we’ve seen strong adoption and regular everyday use for tasks like writing, learning, image creation, and problem-solving,” the company’s announcement stated.

For $8 per month, Go subscribers get more messages, file uploads, and image generation than the free ChatGPT tier subscribers. The price slots Go between the free version of the AI chatbot and the $20-a-month “Plus” subscription tier.

OpenAI says the Go tier is meant for people who want greater access to the company’s fast version of the latest AI model, GPT-5.2 Instant. Currently, free users are limited to 10 messages with GPT‑5.2 every five hours — after that, and the chats switch to the “mini version” of the model. Plus subscribers get 160 messages with GPT‑5.2 for every three hours. Given that the announcement says that users will get “10x” the messages, files, and images than the free tier, we can guess that Go will get 100 messages with GPT-5.2 for who-knows-how-many hours.

The announcement did not specify the number of file uploads or images available each day to Go users. OpenAI does not provide the number of file uploads or images for any of their ChatGPT tiers: free users have a “limited” number of file uploads and image generations, according to the pricing website, while Plus subscribers have a “check-mark” listed instead of an amount.

The memory and context window will be greater for Go users than free users. Again, exact numbers are yet not known. The current context window for non-reasoning requests is 16K for free users and 32K for Plus, while both tiers have a 196K context window for reasoning.

OpenAI says it will “soon” begin running ads in Go in the US, while Plus and higher priced subscriptions will remain ad-free.

An outage still seems to be affecting things on the service formerly known as Twitter.

On Friday morning, X and Grok went offline for users around the world on both the websites and apps. Outage reports began spiking on DownDetector around 10:00AM ET, while Cisco’s ThousandEyes outage map noted over 600 X servers around the world that were having problems.

Attempts to load the site with either the Twitter.com or X.com addresses were showing a Cloudflare connection error or failing to show any posts or feeds initially. It’s currently unclear what caused the outage, and while the site is back up for many users, it’s still not working normally yet, frequently displaying “Something went wrong. Try reloading.”

The website and app began coming back online for some users around 11AM ET. However, the problems seem to be on and off, with the website and app coming back online for some users and showing updated posts, but with continued issues loading feeds and displaying the most recent posts.

X has not yet responded to The Verge’s requests for comment. We will update this article if there is more information available.

            <div id="article-text">President Trump recently signaled he was fine with Chinese automakers setting up shop in the US. But there are still a lot of hurdles to clear.

President Trump recently signaled he was fine with Chinese automakers setting up shop in the US. But there are still a lot of hurdles to clear.

Is the North American blockade on Chinese EVs softening? Today, Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney announced a deal with China to slash tariffs on electric vehicles in exchange for lowering duties on canola products. Canada will initially allow up to 49,000 Chinese EVs at a 6.1 percent tariff, Carney said, though the exact timeline was unclear.

The news comes a few days after President Donald Trump signaled a willingness to allow Chinese EVs in the US, despite his administration’s ongoing trade war with China and long-standing concerns about the potential impact on domestic automakers in the US. At an event in Detroit, Trump said Chinese automakers would be welcome so long as they build factories in the US and hire American workers.

China is the world’s largest car market, and Chinese automakers sell more electric vehicles than practically every other nation combined. The country is particularly famous for cracking the code on extremely cheap EVs — the type that have eluded competitors in other nations. China makes so many EVs that the country’s automakers are locked in a heated price war and have been increasingly exporting their vehicles to other nations to whittle down their bloated inventories.

Canada wouldn’t be the first North American country to allow Chinese auto imports. Mexico has been importing Chinese vehicles for a few years now, including brands like BYD, Chery, and Neta. BYD has been considering building its own factory in Mexico, though those plans appear to be on hold.

But now with Canada opening the door to Chinese automakers, the question is whether BYD, Geely, and other Chinese companies could soon arrive in the US. The US auto industry is deeply intertwined with Canada and Mexico, though Trump’s tariffs have soured relations with the US’s northern and southern neighbors. Around 5.3 million vehicles are built in Canada and Mexico, 70 percent of which are destined for the US.

China still faces enormous hurdles before it can break into the US market, including extremely high tariffs and a complete ban on auto software from China. Experts predict that Chinese cars, and especially EVs, would be enormously disruptive if allowed in the country. Tesla CEO Elon Musk said China’s auto sector would “demolish” US automakers, and Ford CEO Jim Farley basically admitted the same thing.

China certainly senses an impending opportunity. Chinese automakers have been on a media blitz with US-based influencers, showcasing their high-tech, impeccably designed EVs in an effort to give Americans a sense of what they’ve been missing. The influencers clearly love these cars — will policymakers follow?

            <div id="article-text">﻿Alleged sales figures went viral this week, but there’s no good reason to believe them.

﻿Alleged sales figures went viral this week, but there’s no good reason to believe them.

Where’s the Trump phone? We’re going to keep talking about it every week. We’ve reached out, as usual, to ask about the Trump phone’s whereabouts. As usual, we’re still waiting for a response. In the meantime, some impressive alleged sales figures have gone viral — but they might be too good to be true.

This week, I saw something new in my regular scouring of the web for updates on the Trump phone: a repeated claim that Trump Mobile has secured nearly 600,000 preorders for the phone. With a $100 deposit per device, that would make for a tidy $60 million payday for Trump Mobile already.

It’s curious timing, coming just before yesterday’s open letter to the FTC from Elizabeth Warren and a group of other Democrats, calling on the agency to open an investigation into the company’s alleged “false advertising and deceptive practices.” Not everyone agrees Trump Mobile deserves the Democrats’ attention, in part from the assumption that not that many people are likely to have put money down for the phone in the first place. As one commenter on my story yesterday suggested, “I can’t imagine a lot of folks were dumb enough to fall for this.” But according to these new figures, over half a million people were.

There’s just one problem: I can’t find a shred of evidence that this figure is true. In fact, it seems to trace back to a single viral, anonymous X post and is a microcosm of how the modern media landscape and AI chatbots can combine to give falsities the sheen of respectability.

I first saw the figure in, of all places, the Threads feed of California governor Gavin Newsom’s press office, which had shared a screenshot of a tweet of a Grok summary making the claim. Trustworthy, right?

The Grok post cites “reports from sources like Fortune, NPR, and The Guardian” for the 600,000 preorders, but a quick search of their recent output shows no sign of the number. I wanted to know where Grok got it from, if not there.

A quick Google search turns up an awful lot of social media posts, from accounts both big and small, but also a few stories in seemingly legitimate publications. India’s Economic Times and Hindustan Times both reported a more specific figure of 590,000 preorders, referencing an unspecified Associated Press report as the source.

The only recent AP coverage of Trump Mobile was this story from last week, summarizing the repeated delays, which makes no claim to specific preorder figures. I reached out to the organization, and its VP of corporate communications, Lauren Easton, confirmed to me that “AP’s original stories never contained such a number.”

The plot thickens. I tried the authors of the two stories citing AP, and one got back to me. Hindustan Times writer Shamik Banerjee called the citation “a typo,” and told me that the figure was in fact taken from The Times of India.

The Times of India story, which is bylined only to the newspaper’s lifestyle desk, is more transparent in its sourcing: a viral post by a meme account.

Bricktop_NAFO, a seemingly British account with just over 99,000 followers, mostly posts pro-Ukraine content, interspersed with unrelated memes and joke posts. It does a regular line in anti-Trump posts too, and on January 11th, it shared the claim that “590,000 idiots purchased Trumps Mobile phone [sic] that went on sale.”

As far as I can tell, this is the oldest online mention of the 590,000 figure, though the 600,000 number appeared in a Facebook post back in December, albeit one with no likes, no comments, and only a single, private share. Bricktop_NAFO’s post, by contrast, has been viewed 2.8 million times according to X and reposted another 8,000. It’s ground zero for this particular strain of misinformation.

I reached out to Bricktop_NAFO, both in its DMs and in a public reply to the post, to ask if it had a source for the claim, but the account owner didn’t reply in time for publication. I also asked if it could point me toward the $45 Temu phone it claimed was a match — my colleague Allison Johnson previously tried, and failed, to find an exact dupe of the T1 Phone, and as far as I’m aware, no one has successfully matched its spec sheet and design to an existing handset.

The ripple effect from this single tweet has been impressive. X’s own share figures above don’t include the countless other posts that have picked up the made-up number and run with it, even taking it as far as Governor Newsom’s press office. It’s been covered by multiple publications, now presented as fact on MSN.com and tech site Phone Arena. And that coverage has helped it to filter into the chatbots and not just Grok — Gemini and ChatGPT were both happy to confirm to me that 600,000 T1 Phones have been ordered so far, the former falsely attributing the number to the Associated Press, and the latter to Phone Arena.

As for how many Trump Phone preorders have actually been placed? No one outside the company knows, and so far, it’s not telling. I asked the Trump Mobile press office for an actual preorder figure but, believe it or not, I haven’t heard back.

            <div id="article-text">﻿From window shopping and browsing to reviews and recommendations, retailers and tech companies envision a future filled with artificial intelligence — whether shoppers want it or not.

Photography by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge

Several people are gathered around a bleach blond man in a bright pink suit suspended in a clear plastic tube. With a microphone in front of him and a giant sign reading TALK TO ME placed above, “Mike” waits, hands clasped patiently in front of his body, to take questions from his public. “Mike” is a hologram, powered by ChatGPT and created by a company called Hypervsn.

The responses “Mike” gives to audience comments and questions are on a three-ish second delay, but the stunted flow of conversation might not matter much — an attendant at the Hypervsn booth tells me that when “Mike” and his ilk are deployed to stores, they are meant to act more as icebreakers, a way to lure potential customers into engaging with a brand. (The world’s largest holographic display thrills tourists at the Las Vegas Sphere and was also made by Hypervsn.)

“Mike” is one of the flashier products exhibited at the National Retail Federation’s enormous annual trade show, where more than a thousand retail-adjacent companies descend on New York City to try to sell each other products and services that will then be used to sell actual goods to the rest of us. There are the big names (Google, Alibaba, Amazon) along with scores of other companies that help power the online and in-person shopping experiences but are unknown to the average consumer. No matter what vendors are exhibiting, though, one thing is clear: The future they imagine for all of us is overwhelmingly filled with AI — often in ways that a consumer would probably hate.

A few feet away from “Mike” is another hologram, also suspended midair in a clear box a few feet tall; this one is a small, gnome-like creature dressed in a monochromatic, vaguely medieval outfit (I did not catch his name). At times he responds in rhyming verse to audience questions, his tiny hands gesturing as naturally as a theme park animatronic. Retail clients are increasingly requesting non-human holographic characters, a Hypervsn attendant tells me, in an effort to distance themselves from fears that AI will replace or eliminate people’s jobs. If this is the future of retail, even “Mike” may not have a place in it.

There were many promises made at the National Retail Federation’s massive trade show, held in mid-January. Some exhibitors swore to provide “touchscreens for everything,” others reassured convention-goers that “commerce favors the bold.” But the most urgent hopes were around AI. Shopify announced that “the commerce renaissance is here” (italics theirs). Other exhibitors touted “smart people counting” and “AI customer flow analysis.” We come to this place not for magic, but for “merchandizing execution with AI.”

Much of this is likely word salad to the average consumer — but if you shop online, the AI creep has become inescapable. Retail and tech companies have crammed AI into just about every step of the purchasing process, from designing products, to discovery and comparison, to calling brick and mortar stores, to trying on clothing, and finally checking out. At NRF’s trade show, Google announced an open-source standard called the Universal Commerce Protocol (UCP) that allows retailers and AI agents to communicate and integrate, so shoppers can buy products from Target within Google’s AI Mode, for example, without going to Target’s website. As tech companies build more direct buying features into chatbots, some are hoping coupons and deals can entice purchases: Google also announced that retailers will be able to set up discounts for shoppers browsing in AI Mode. Monetizing AI-powered shopping is clearly a priority for Google: the company had a large presence at the show, and CEO Sundar Pichai gave a keynote address (on the other hand, Pichai had no public appearances at CES, and Google had no major announcements).

As AI has snaked its way into every gadget, platform, and service imaginable, it’s hard not to wonder who the intended user is — and whether anyone, ever, has wanted the kind of features AI makes possible.

Pizza chain Papa Johns is one of the partners integrating Google’s agentic shopping features into its ordering system. Customers will soon be able to order via a chatbot that can autofill in their last order, suggest items based on dietary restrictions, add coupons and deals, and use a “pizza assistant” to get recommendations for group orders. In a demo video shared by Papa Johns, the chatbot assistant asks for the number of people in the group. Don’t want to count how many people are eating? No problem — just upload a photo of everyone in the group into the Papa Johns chatbot.

There is also, of course, the evolution of industries that were upended by the rapid introduction of AI. Retailers used to prioritize tweaking their websites to get Google to place their link above competitors’ in search — but now search engine optimization, or SEO, has branched off into new AI-focused acronyms: AEO (answer engine optimization), GEO (generative engine optimization), GSO (generative search optimization), and likely other future terms the general public will come to despise. A company called Fabric promises to help brands and retailers monitor their performance within platforms like ChatGPT, Gemini, and Perplexity, measuring how often your items are surfaced relative to your competitors. A representative from Fabric says some retailers are especially good at getting surfaced in AI chat — Nordstrom, for example — but acknowledged that nobody really knows how the systems work or what they choose to elevate. Fabric’s AI monitoring service starts at $500 a month, according to its website.

Many of the products and services on display at the NRF show are on the back-end — firms working on things like inventory management tools or logistics, where consumers have less insight. But the consumer is an ever-deepening well of data; the promise of AI in retail is that these tools can extract more and more information from us, which can be used to sell us more things.

Solum is a South Korean company specializing in digital displays and shelves — those signs in the supermarket playing glossy ads for chips or beer, for example. But the next iteration is to hyper-personalize and target shoppers in stores, the way digital retailers are able to do to online shoppers. Using a technology built by a South Korean startup called SpaceVision, a retailer could assign a number to each shopper and track their movements through a store: how long they watched an ad, whether they simply walked by without engaging, if they picked up a product off the shelf. The store could then use that data to trigger certain behaviors: for example, if you watched a certain chip ad on a display, the store could push through a deal for you for beer to go with your chip purchase; it applies the tracking of online shopping into the real world. As I approached a wall of Coors and Heineken (not affiliated with SpaceVision) cans arranged on a shelf at the Solum booth, I noticed a screen above the display. It took me a moment to realize my own image was staring back at me, captured by the SpaceVision demo. With a bold box surrounding my face, I was Global ID number 485, gender: female, age group: 18–29. Retailers can use the data to track the demographic breakdown of people who pass displays, along with their “glance” and “attention” rates and conversions.

A SpaceVision employee working the booth at the show said that when deployed in the real world, video is deleted a millisecond after the metadata is captured — they are focused on milking the engagement data that can be used to retarget shoppers later on. The technology has so far only been used in select stores in South Korea and Japan, but the staffer acknowledges that shoppers in Europe or the US might be uneasy about the technology becoming part of the in-person shopping experience. It creates, essentially, a vast data dragnet of IRL shopping habits to mine for new and more invasive ways to sell things — the monetization of that omnipresent surveilling eye. Shoppers in Europe would balk at cameras. On the other hand, the staffer says, “Asian people don’t give a fuck.”

Equapack’s booth at NRF 2026 stood out for a few reasons: For one, it was empty when I stumbled upon it in one of the trade show’s many, many rooms. It was also calm: No giant LED screens, no holographic gnomes, no humanoid talking robots, and no grand AI-related promises. The booth consisted of several long, white shelves with dozens of shopping bags, totes, cooler bags, and other retailer packaging carefully lined up. Among the selection were iconic and instantly recognizable names: the classic red and white Supreme streetwear logo on plain white bags; US Open drawstring backpacks; a tote bearing the logo of Broadway’s The Lion King. Unlike everything else I saw during the day, Equapack’s offerings were designed to be closer to the human at the end of the transaction — not to add additional layers of data, AI-powered analysis, and abstraction.

The trade show used to be more tactile like this, says Eran Rothschild, Equapack’s founder and CEO. All the packaging they design starts from a problem that the brand needs to solve: perhaps they need something to keep perishable items cold for a certain number of hours, or maybe they simply want a bag that is aesthetically beautiful and evocative. Equapack does not promise AI-powered solutions because it doesn’t use AI, though Rothschild admits that it probably should, at least for back-end operations — design is just 25 percent of the job.

“We’ll probably never use AI visualization because it’s not true to the product that we’re going to be delivering,” Rothschild says. “We prefer making samples and making that tactility. No one’s going to purchase something that they can’t see.”

AI slop has only one goal: scale. It does not matter if the AI-generated clips flooding social media are good or even entertaining — they simply need to take up space, and by extension, a human’s time. Could an AI chatbot on every online ordering page transform the customer experience, whether they’re ordering clothing or pizza delivery? Maybe. But it also feels like added bulk that has little bearing on whether the thing we bought — the actual product coming into our homes — is better than it would have otherwise been.

As we’re talking, I realize that I personally own several bags that Rothschild has worked on, including packaging from The RealReal, a secondhand clothing and accessories marketplace. Whether the item you purchase is $30 or $3,000, The RealReal mails products in fabric dustbags, a practice largely limited to luxury retailers. I reuse every dustbag I get, carefully storing items in them to protect them and extend their life. For every project, Rothschild thinks about how the consumer will experience the packaging — is it reusable, is it luxurious? Does it make the purchased product feel like money well spent? Of all the tech and services I saw throughout the day, Equapack’s offerings are one of the few that a consumer will actually hold in their hands and take home with them. There is intention, a sense of intimacy. I will likely never think back fondly to an experience chatting with an AI shopping assistant. The humble shopping bag, though, will linger.

Depending who you ask, AI-powered coding is either giving software developers an unprecedented productivity boost or churning out masses of poorly designed code that saps their attention and sets software projects up for serious long term-maintenance problems.

The problem is right now, it’s not easy to know which is true.

As tech giants pour billions into large language models (LLMs), coding has been touted as the technology’s killer app. Executives enamored with the potential are pushing engineers to lean into an AI-powered future. But after speaking to more than 30 developers, technology executives, analysts, and researchers, MIT Technology Review found that the picture is not as straightforward as it might seem. Read the full story.

Generative coding is one of our 10 Breakthrough Technologies this year. Learn more about why that is, and check out the rest of the list!

This story was also part of our Hype Correction package. You can read the rest of the stories here.

Earlier this week, MIT Technology Review published our annual list of Ten Breakthrough Technologies.

This year’s list includes tech that’s set to transform the energy industry, artificial intelligence, space travel—and of course biotech and health. Our breakthrough biotechnologies for 2026 involve editing a baby’s genes and, separately, resurrecting genes from ancient species. We also included a controversial technology that offers parents the chance to screen their embryos for characteristics like height and intelligence. Here’s the story behind our biotech choices.

“I am very annoyed. I’m very disappointed. I’m seriously frustrated.”

—Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla tells attendees at a healthcare conference this week his feelings about the anti-vaccine agenda Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has been implementing, Bloomberg reports.

Technically speaking, neuroscientists have been able to read your mind for decades. It’s not easy, mind you. First, you must lie motionless within a fMRI scanner, perhaps for hours, while you watch films or listen to audiobooks.

If you do elect to endure claustrophobic hours in the scanner, the software will learn to generate a bespoke reconstruction of what you were seeing or listening to, just by analyzing how blood moves through your brain.

More recently, researchers have deployed generative AI tools, like Stable Diffusion and GPT, to create far more realistic, if not entirely accurate, reconstructions of films and podcasts based on neural activity. So how close are we to genuine “mind reading?” Read the full story.

            <div id="article-text">Earlier this week, MIT Technology Review published its annual list of Ten Breakthrough Technologies. As always, it features technologies that made the news last year, and which—for better or worse—stand to make waves in the coming years. They’re the technologies you should really be paying attention to.

This year’s list includes tech that’s set to transform the energy industry, artificial intelligence, space travel—and of course biotech and health. Our breakthrough biotechnologies for 2026 involve editing a baby’s genes and, separately, resurrecting genes from ancient species. We also included a controversial technology that offers parents the chance to screen their embryos for characteristics like height and intelligence. Here’s the story behind our biotech choices.

In August 2024, KJ Muldoon was born with a rare genetic disorder that allowed toxic ammonia to build up in his blood. The disease can be fatal, and KJ was at risk of developing neurological disorders. At the time, his best bet for survival involved waiting for a liver transplant.

Then he was offered an experimental gene therapy—a personalized “base editing” treatment designed to correct the specific genetic “misspellings” responsible for his disease. It seems to have worked! Three doses later, KJ is doing well. He took his first steps in December, shortly before spending his first Christmas at home.

KJ’s story is hugely encouraging. The team behind his treatment is planning a clinical trial for infants with similar disorders caused by different genetic mutations. The team members hope to win regulatory approval on the back of a small trial—a move that could make the expensive treatment (KJ’s cost around $1 million) more accessible, potentially within a few years.

Others are getting in on the action, too. Fyodor Urnov, a gene-editing scientist at the University of California, Berkeley, assisted the team that developed KJ’s treatment. He recently cofounded Aurora Therapeutics, a startup that hopes to develop gene-editing drugs for another disorder called phenylketonuria (PKU). The goal is to obtain regulatory approval for a single drug that can then be adjusted or personalized for individuals without having to go through more clinical trials.

US regulators seem to be amenable to the idea and have described a potential approval pathway for such “bespoke, personalized therapies.” Watch this space.

It was a big year for Colossal Biosciences, the biotech company hoping to “de-extinct” animals like the woolly mammoth and the dodo. In March, the company created what it called “woolly mice”—rodents with furry coats and curly whiskers akin to those of woolly mammoths.

The company made an even more dramatic claim the following month, when it announced it had created three dire wolves. These striking snow-white animals were created by making 20 genetic changes to the DNA of gray wolves based on genetic research on ancient dire wolf bones, the company said at the time.

Whether these animals can really be called dire wolves is debatable, to say the least. But the technology behind their creation is undeniably fascinating. We’re talking about the extraction and analysis of ancient DNA, which can then be introduced into cells from other, modern-day species.

Analysis of ancient DNA can reveal all sorts of fascinating insights into human ancestors and other animals. And cloning, another genetic tool used here, has applications not only in attempts to re-create dead pets but also in wildlife conservation efforts. Read more here.

IVF involves creating embryos in a lab and, typically, “scoring” them on their likelihood of successful growth before they are transferred to a person’s uterus. So far, so uncontroversial.

Recently, embryo scoring has evolved. Labs can pinch off a couple of cells from an embryo, look at its DNA, and screen for some genetic diseases. That list of diseases is increasing. And now some companies are taking things even further, offering prospective parents the opportunity to select embryos for features like height, eye color, and even IQ.

This is controversial for lots of reasons. For a start, there are many, many factors that contribute to complex traits like IQ (a score that doesn’t capture all aspects of intelligence at any rate). We don’t have a perfect understanding of those factors, or how selecting for one trait might influence another.

Some critics warn of eugenics. And others note that whichever embryo you end up choosing, you can’t control exactly how your baby will turn out (and why should you?!). Still, that hasn’t stopped Nucleus, one of the companies offering these services, from inviting potential customers to have their “best baby.” Read more here.

In April 2025, Ronald Deibert left all electronic devices at home in Toronto and boarded a plane. When he landed in Illinois, he bought a new laptop and iPhone. He wanted to reduce the risk of having his personal devices confiscated, because he knew his work made him a prime target for surveillance. “I’m traveling under the assumption that I am being watched, right down to exactly where I am at any moment,” Deibert says.

Deibert directs the Citizen Lab, a research center he founded in 2001 to serve as “counterintelligence for civil society.” Housed at the University of Toronto, it’s one of the few institutions that investigate cyberthreats exclusively in the public interest, and in doing so, it has exposed some of the most egregious digital abuses of the past two decades.

For many years, Deibert and his colleagues have held up the US as the standard for liberal democracy. But that’s changing. Read the full story.

As thousands of companies trumpet their plans to cut carbon pollution, a small group of sustainability consultants has emerged as the go-to arbiter of corporate climate action.

The Science Based Targets initiative, or SBTi, helps businesses develop a timetable for action to shrink their climate footprint through some combination of cutting greenhouse-gas pollution and removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. After years of small-scale sustainability work, SBTi is growing rapidly, and governments are paying attention.

But while the group has earned praise for reeling the private sector into constructive conversations about climate emissions, its rising influence has also attracted scrutiny and raised questions about why a single organization is setting the standards for many of the world’s largest companies.

For 25 years, MIT Technology Review has put together this package, which highlights the technologies that we think are going to matter in the future. This year’s version has some stars, including gene resurrection (remember all the dire wolf hype last year?) and commercial space stations.

And of course, the world of climate and energy is represented with sodium-ion batteries, next-generation nuclear, and hyperscale AI data centers. Let’s take a look at what ended up on the list, and what it says about this moment for climate tech.

I’ve been covering sodium-ion batteries for years, but this moment feels like a breakout one for the technology.

Today, lithium-ion cells power everything from EVs, phones, and computers to huge stationary storage arrays that help support the grid. But researchers and battery companies have been racing to develop an alternative, driven by the relative scarcity of lithium and the metal’s volatile price in recent years.

Sodium-ion batteries could be that alternative. Sodium is much more abundant than lithium, and it could unlock cheaper batteries that hold a lower fire risk.

There are limitations here: Sodium-ion batteries won’t be able to pack as much energy into cells as their lithium counterparts. But it might not matter, especially for grid storage and smaller EVs.

In recent years, we’ve seen a ton of interest in sodium-based batteries, particularly from major companies in China. Now the new technology is starting to make its way into the world—CATL says it started manufacturing these batteries at scale in 2025.

Nuclear reactors are an important part of grids around the world today—massive workhorse reactors generate reliable, consistent electricity. But the countries with the oldest and most built-out fleets have struggled to add to them in recent years, since reactors are massive and cost billions. Recent high-profile projects have gone way over budget and faced serious delays.

Next-generation reactor designs could help the industry break out of the old blueprint and get more nuclear power online more quickly, and they’re starting to get closer to becoming reality.

There’s a huge variety of proposals when it comes to what’s next for nuclear. Some companies are building smaller reactors, which they say could make it easier to finance new projects, and get them done on time.

Other companies are focusing on tweaking key technical bits of reactors, using alternative fuels or coolants that help ferry heat out of the reactor core. These changes could help reactors generate electricity more efficiently and safely.

Kairos Power was the first US company to receive approval to begin construction on a next-generation reactor to produce electricity. China is emerging as a major center of nuclear development, with the country’s national nuclear company reportedly working on several next-gen reactors.

This one isn’t quite what I would call a climate technology, but I spent most of last year reporting on the climate and environmental impacts of AI, and the AI boom is deeply intertwined with climate and energy.

Data centers aren’t new, but we’re seeing a wave of larger centers being proposed and built to support the rise of AI. Some of these facilities require a gigawatt or more of power—that’s like the output of an entire conventional nuclear power plant, just for one data center.

(This feels like a good time to mention that our Breakthrough Technologies list doesn’t just highlight tech that we think will have a straightforwardly positive influence on the world. I think back to our 2023 list, which included mass-market military drones.)

There’s no denying that new, supersize data centers are an important force driving electricity demand, sparking major public pushback, and emerging as a key bit of our new global infrastructure.

The popularity of commercial nuclear reactors has surged in recent years as worries about climate change and energy independence drowned out concerns about meltdowns and radioactive waste. The problem is, building nuclear power plants is expensive and slow.

A new generation of nuclear power technology could reinvent what a reactor looks like—and how it works. Advocates hope that new tech can refresh the industry and help replace fossil fuels without emitting greenhouse gases.  Here’s what that might look like.

Africa is still early in the process of adopting AI technologies. But researchers say the continent is uniquely hospitable to it for several reasons, including a relatively young and increasingly well-educated population, a rapidly growing ecosystem of AI startups, and lots of potential consumers.

However, ambitious efforts to develop AI tools that answer the needs of Africans face numerous hurdles. Taken together, researchers worry, they could hold Africa’s AI sector back and hamper its efforts to pave its own pathway in the global AI race. Read the full story.

            <div id="article-text">In January 2026, London’s mayor gave a blunt warning that has reverberated far beyond City Hall: artificial intelligence could trigger “mass unemployment” in the capital’s core industries unless policymakers act now.

His words came with an unexpected counterweight: an announcement of free AI training and a dedicated task force to help workers adapt. This juxtaposition captures a tension shaping Europe’s labour landscape: fear and opportunity locked in the same story.

The anxiety isn’t limited to one city. Across the continent, debates about AI’s impact on jobs are intensifying. Visionaries and critics paint dramatically different pictures. Some technologists warn that advanced AI could substitute human labour at an unprecedented pace.

“AI will replace humans”, you heard this before.

Others argue these fears are exaggerated or misplaced if governments and employers can guide the transition. For many Europeans, the question is no longer theoretical; it is unfolding before their eyes.

At first look, the job market’s headline figures tell a reassuring story: overall unemployment across the European Union remains low, with EU unemployment at about 5.8% in 2025, down from 6.0% a year earlier. Youth unemployment has also declined in many countries, indicating that even entry-level opportunities persist for most workers.

In some sectors where AI tools are already in use, work has been reshaped rather than eliminated. A European study found that 30% of EU workers now use AI at work, especially for text tasks like writing and translation, and that digital tools have become nearly universal (90%) across workplaces.

Many workers report that AI helps them perform tasks more efficiently or take on different responsibilities. At the same time, employers are actively reassessing job roles because of AI, with about 71% of European firms reconsidering job responsibilities due to AI implementation and over a quarter reducing hiring or cutting roles as a direct result of AI deployment.

Beneath these numbers lie subtler shifts. Firms across the EU are becoming cautious about hiring, in part because of economic slowdowns and in part because AI adoption is changing how work gets done. Economic indicators suggest employment growth across the EU will slow in the coming years, with fewer vacancies and reduced labour market dynamism even as AI use spreads.

The most visible tension is at the intersection of perception and preparation. On the one hand, public statements like London’s mayors reflect a palpable fear of displacement. Sectors such as finance, legal services, and customer support, pillars of many European economies,  are widely considered vulnerable to automation and generative AI technologies.

Detailed labour data suggest that many jobs are being reshaped at the task level, even if entire job categories are not yet disappearing wholesale. For example, AI is automating routine text production and data tasks while increasingly augmenting analytical and oversight functions.

On the other hand, there are signs of adaptability. Governments and institutions are launching initiatives to reskill workers and embed AI fluency into professional development. Across Europe, digital skills gaps remain significant; only 56% of adults aged 16-74 had basic digital skills in 2023, well below the EU’s target, indicating the scale of upskilling needed.

Educational efforts range from vocational programs to industry partnerships that teach AI-related skills. For example, private training providers across the EU are expanding online programs in data science, analytics, and AI competencies, reflecting a growing recognition that skills matter as much as technology itself.

It would be a mistake to frame this moment as simply a binary between jobs lost and jobs saved. The World Economic Forum’s Future of Jobs Report 2025 predicts both creation and disruption, with employers foreseeing demand for entirely new roles even as others change or shrink.

The report finds that technologies, including AI, are expected to create millions of new jobs globally while displacing an estimated number of others, highlighting the scale of transformation.

There is also a policy dimension that can’t be overlooked. European institutions are experimenting with social safety nets and active labour market policies that aim to cushion displacement and support transitions.

Proposals like a European AI Social Compact argue for strategies that combine employment support, training, and social protections as central to economic planning.

National governments are debating everything from expanded unemployment support tied to training to tax incentives for companies that invest in human capital alongside AI. These measures acknowledge that the future of work is not simply about machines replacing people, but about how people and machines can be integrated into resilient labour ecosystems.

Yet challenges remain. Entry-level opportunities, the traditional gateway for recent graduates, are tightening in many sectors as employers increasingly use automated systems in recruitment and candidate screening.

Surveys suggest broad concern among young job seekers about prospects in an AI-transformed market, even where overall employment remains stable.

Some employers are re-imagining entry paths by embedding AI training into internship programs, while others are partnering with universities to co-design curricula that emphasize AI-augmented work. These efforts signal that adaptation is possible, but they also highlight how uneven the transition has been so far.

What Europe faces now is not a single story of mass job losses or unrestrained job growth. It is a mosaic of experiences, where headlines of risk and reports of adaptation coexist. The labour market is not static; it is reacting to technology, to policy, to fear and hope in equal measure.

If there is a throughline, it’s this: Europe’s future of work will be shaped not just by the capabilities of artificial intelligence, but by choices about education, regulation, and social support.

The decisions policymakers and employers make today will tilt the balance between disruption and opportunity. In that sense, the conversation is less about whether AI will change jobs; it already is, and more about how Europe navigates the change.

That is the reality workers, firms, and governments must confront together.

This reminds me of the well-known anecdote in Romanian political history in which Ion I.C. (Ionel) Brătianu, asked by historian and politician Nicolae Iorga what a scholar could learn from an engineer, replied with just that phrase, a call for moderation and thoughtful judgment: “Measure, sir, measure!”

Thus, measure, thoughtful regulation, and worker-focused policy will make sure AI supports people’s work, protects rights, and steers technological change toward shared opportunity, not making them unemployed.

            <h2>Belgian cybersecurity startup becomes unicorn</h2>
            <p><strong>The Next Web | 2026-01-14</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://thenextweb.com/news/aikido-security-becomes-unicorn">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Belgian cybersecurity startup Aikido Security has closed a $60 million Series B funding round at a $1 billion valuation, marking a rare unicorn milestone for a European security company and highlighting the accelerating interest in developer-centric security platforms.

The round was led by DST Global, a tech-oriented investment firm with a track record of backing major technology companies, and included participation from PSG Equity, Notion Capital, and Singular. Founded in 2022, Aikido has reached a billion-dollar valuation in just three years, a pace few cybersecurity firms attain, and according to company sources, the fastest in Europe.

The new capital will help Aikido accelerate product development and expand further into key markets, especially the United States, where it already generates around half of its revenue. In the past year, the company’s revenue grew roughly fivefold, while its customer base nearly tripled.

Aikido’s core proposition is rooted in the conviction that traditional application security tools have not kept pace with the rapid evolution of software development. Modern engineering teams ship code more frequently, and the widespread adoption of AI tools for coding has heightened both velocity and risk. Legacy scanners and point solutions can generate noise and distract developers, rather than offering actionable insights at the right moment.

Instead of siloed products that address a single layer of the stack, Aikido provides a unified platform that spans code analysis, cloud security, and runtime monitoring, with an emphasis on automation. The platform is designed to detect risks early in the development process, prioritise issues based on real-world impact, and help engineering teams fix problems before they reach production.

CEO Willem Delbare has framed the product as “guardrails” for developers, tools that fit fluidly into existing workflows rather than creating extra hurdles.

Customers range from gaming and mobile app developers to fintech and music streaming platforms, with names like Niantic, Revolut, and SoundCloud appearing among early adopters. These use cases underscore demand for security tools that can keep pace with modern development practices, where agility and context are essential.

Aikido’s valuation and investor interest reflect broader trends in the cybersecurity landscape. Once a domain dominated by perimeter defence and signature-based detection, security has had to adapt as software infrastructure shifts to cloud services, microservices architectures, and continuous delivery. Investors are especially focused on tools that reduce friction for engineering teams and support automated, context-aware security workflows.

DST Global’s lead on the round is noteworthy given the firm’s history of backing companies that scale globally.

In a funding environment where investor scrutiny has tightened and deals are won largely on product differentiation and tangible traction, Aikido’s growth metrics have helped draw attention. A fivefold increase in revenue within a year and strong adoption metrics among engineering teams suggest a product that resonates with users, not just buyers.

Aikido’s unicorn status also illustrates how European startups in traditionally U.S.-centric sectors like cybersecurity can carve out meaningful niches. Security products have long struggled to escape the shadow of established players headquartered in Silicon Valley and Tel Aviv, but a steady wave of startups with developer-oriented tools has begun to reshape expectations.

That said, the competitive landscape remains crowded.

Vendors across cloud security, application scanning, vulnerability management, and developer tooling are all vying for engineering team attention. Some focus on narrow functions such as static analysis or open-source risk, while others bundle broader offerings. Aikido bets that a unified, integrated experience can reduce cognitive load and streamline security workflows.

In its own communications, Aikido has described evolving toward what it calls “self-securing software,” a future state where systems can automatically test, detect, and remediate vulnerabilities without extensive human intervention. This vision is reflected in recent product releases that embed automated penetration testing and contextual risk analysis directly into development pipelines.

Technical roadmaps shared by the company suggest deeper integrations with cloud platforms and enhanced automation capabilities, allowing developers to catch and fix issues as code is written and deployed. This direction aligns with broader industry shifts toward “security as code,” where security functions are embedded in the same workflows as infrastructure and application development.

Expanding partnerships with cloud providers and refining API-first integrations are likely priorities for Aikido in the near term. As engineering teams increasingly adopt secure development practices as part of their standard operating model, integrated platforms become more attractive than point solutions that require separate processes and tools.

Aikido’s rapid growth and investor backing reinforce a fundamental shift in security tooling: developers are now viewed as primary stakeholders in safeguarding software. This contrasts with earlier models where specialised security teams acted as gatekeepers. By aligning security functions with development workflows, tools like Aikido aim to reduce friction while improving risk visibility.

For investors, the deal is a signal that cybersecurity remains a fertile ground for innovation, particularly where AI and automation intersect with foundational development practices. As software becomes more complex and distributed, demand for real-time, integrated security controls will only rise.

Aikido’s unicorn milestone is less about the label and more about the validation of a model that places developers at the centre of security. If successful, this approach could influence how future security platforms are built and adopted across the industry.

            <p><strong>The Next Web | 2026-01-13</strong></p>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">For years, online shopping followed a fixed path. Search bar, product grid, filters, checkout. The interface barely changed, even as everything else on the internet did. That path is now breaking.

Monday 12 January, 2026, JD Sports Fashion plc (JD Group) became one of the first large retailers to let US customers search and buy sneakers directly inside AI chatbots, including ChatGPT, Microsoft Copilot, and Google Gemini. No website visit. No app. Just a conversation that ends with a payment.

Basically, a customer can chat with an AI bot, say “add these shoes to my cart,” and complete a purchase in one click.

JD Sports has agreed a global deal with commercetools to enable “one-click” purchases on AI assistants including Copilot, Gemini and ChatGPT. US customers will simply tell the chatbot what they want and pay instantly via Stripe’s integrated payment flow.

The retailer is the first to deploy commercetools’ “Agentic Jumpstart” solution along with Stripe’s Agentic Commerce Suite (ACS). Stripe handles the payment and fraud protection, while commercetools’ AI Hub keeps JD’s product data, pricing and availability in sync across all AI channels.

For example, “Find me a pair of Nike Air Max size 10.” The AI queries JD’s catalog (via commercetools) and returns relevant products, with images and details. The shopper can then say “buy this pair,” and Stripe handles the checkout seamlessly. Commercetools and Stripe emphasize that all payment and fulfillment data still flow through JD’s systems – the retailer retains control over inventory, pricing, and customer experience.

AI-driven shopping shifts the act of buying from browsing to intent-based conversation.

Instead of scrolling through hundreds of sneakers, a customer can ask for “black running shoes under $150, good for daily training,” refine the request, compare options, and pay, all within the same chat. The AI handles discovery, filtering, and decision support in one flow.

For consumers, that means less friction and less time spent navigating interfaces designed around catalogs, not questions. For retailers, it means the loss of something they’ve relied on for two decades: control over the shopping journey.

JD Sports CEO Regis Schultz compared the impact of AI on retail to the internet boom of the late 1990s and suggested it could shrink physical store footprints by reducing the need for cash desks. The comment points to a wider rethink. If discovery and checkout move into AI layers, both digital and physical stores become less central.

Traditional e-commerce platforms are built around pages, categories, and conversion funnels. AI shopping ignores most of that. When purchases happen inside chatbots, platforms lose visibility into how customers arrive at decisions. Brand differentiation becomes harder when products are presented as answers rather than destinations. Loyalty shifts from websites to whichever AI assistant the customer trusts.

This creates a new competitive layer. Retailers are no longer just competing on price, delivery, or UX, but on how well their inventory, data, and brand translate into AI-mediated conversations. It also raises questions for marketplaces. If AI assistants can compare products across multiple retailers in real time, the advantage of being the “place people go to shop” weakens.

Letting customers buy without visiting a website introduces new risks. Retailers must ensure that payments remain secure, that inventory and pricing are accurate in real time, and that the brand experience doesn’t dissolve into a generic AI response. Stripe’s role here is critical, acting as the trust layer that makes conversational checkout viable at scale.

There’s also the issue of accountability. When something goes wrong, a failed payment, a wrong size, a delayed delivery, the customer interacts with an AI, not a store. Retailers still own the outcome, even if they no longer own the interface.

JD Sports is not alone. The move points to a broader pattern: commerce is migrating upward into AI systems that sit between consumers and brands. As mobile apps reshaped shopping in the 2010s, conversational AI is reshaping it again, this time by pushing the store itself out of the center of the experience.

What replaces it is less visible, but more powerful: intent, context, and conversation. Retail isn’t disappearing. It’s dissolving into the tools people already use to think, search, and decide.

There is something undeniably impressive about this evolution. Buying becomes faster, friction thins, decisions compress into a few lines of text. Yet, step by step, human interaction is quietly being removed from the equation. The cashier, the sales assistant, even the act of browsing alongside others, all fade into background infrastructure.

The open question isn’t whether this shift will happen, but how far it should go. When shopping becomes a dialogue with machines, convenience wins, but presence is lost. Retail now faces a new design challenge, not just how to sell through AI, but how to decide where human interaction still matters, and how to keep it from disappearing by default.

            <div id="article-text">For the past few years, artificial intelligence has been discussed almost exclusively in terms of models. Bigger models, faster models, smarter models. More recently, the focus shifted to agents, systems capable of planning, reasoning, and acting autonomously.

Yet the real leap in usefulness does not happen at the model level, nor at the agent level. It happens one layer above, at the level of Skills.

If models represent intelligence and agents represent coordination, Skills are where AI becomes operational and valuable in the real world.

A Skill is an applied, reusable unit of procedural knowledge that allows an AI system to reliably perform a specific task from start to finish.

A workspace designed for growth, collaboration, and endless networking opportunities in the heart of tech.

In practical terms, a Skill is an intelligent application that transforms user intent into execution.

A Skill has a clearly defined purpose. It encapsulates domain-specific know-how. It follows a repeatable procedure. And it produces a concrete, usable result.

This could mean analyzing a contract and identifying risks, comparing multiple SaaS tools based on real business constraints, generating a pricing strategy using market data, or producing a financial or operational report.

Users never interact with models or agents directly. What they experience are Skills, because Skills are the part of AI that delivers outcomes.

To understand why Skills matter, it helps to look at the modern AI stack. At the foundation are models. They provide raw intelligence such as language understanding, reasoning, perception, and pattern recognition. They are powerful, but fundamentally generic.

Above them sit agents. Agents function like an operating system. They plan tasks, break problems into steps, decide which tools or models to use, and manage execution flow. They are good coordinators, but coordination alone does not equal expertise.

At the top of the stack are Skills. Skills are the application layer. They are structured, purpose-built capabilities that agents can invoke to get real work done. Just as hardware is not software and software is not an application, intelligence is not usefulness. Models are not agents, and agents are not Skills.

A Skill is not a single instruction. It is an orchestrated process. When a user expresses a concrete need, such as wanting to know which SaaS solution best fits their company, the system identifies the relevant Skill. An agent then decomposes the task into procedural steps. Requirements are gathered, data is retrieved, evaluation logic is applied, and results are synthesized. Models perform analysis and reasoning at each step, and the Skill delivers a structured outcome such as a recommendation, report, decision, or document.

From the user’s perspective, none of this complexity is visible. The Skill simply works.

One of the most important distinctions is that Skills encode procedural knowledge rather than descriptive knowledge. Large language models are excellent at explaining what something is. Skills capture how something is actually done.

This procedural knowledge may include workflows, scripts, decision logic, rules, tool integrations, and structured reasoning steps. It is what turns general intelligence into expert behavior. Agents on their own are capable planners, but they lack deep, domain-specific execution knowledge. Skills fill that gap.

This is also why Skills scale better than custom-built agents. A common mistake today is creating a new agent for every task. That approach quickly becomes brittle and unmanageable. Skills, by contrast, are modular, reusable, and composable. A small number of general-purpose agents can call a growing library of specialized Skills, each focused on doing one thing well. This mirrors how scalable software systems are built in practice.

Another critical point is that Skills are products, not just technology. They can be packaged, licensed, distributed, integrated, and monetized. Users and businesses do not buy reasoning or intelligence in the abstract. They buy capabilities. They buy outcomes. They buy the ability to make better decisions and execute faster.

As models become increasingly commoditized and agent frameworks begin to converge, the real competitive advantage in AI is shifting. It will belong to those who build the most useful Skills and control how they are distributed.

In the long run, AI systems will not be judged by how intelligent they are, but by how effectively they convert intelligence into action.

Models think. Agents coordinate. Skills execute.

            <h2>AI is old news. Generative AI is the future.</h2>
            <p><strong>The Next Web | 2026-01-10</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://thenextweb.com/news/generative-ai-is-the-future">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The term Artificial Intelligence (AI) is well known, often evoking futuristic movies like Robocop, Terminator and The Matrix. Yet what many don’t realize is that AI has been part of our lives for decades.

When you finish watching a movie on a streaming platform and instantly see recommendations for similar content, that’s AI. When you’re shopping online and an entire page of suggested products appears, that’s AI. Even the digital ads you see are powered by machine-learning algorithms designed to optimize engagement, clicks, and conversions.

Companies have relied on AI rule-based automation, routines, and machine-learning algorithms for years to power their systems and business processes.

So when you hear conversations about the “urgent need to start using AI,” pause for a moment. AI itself isn’t new, the real transformation we’re witnessing comes from Generative AI, a newer branch of deep learning, which itself is a subset of machine learning.

Artificial Intelligence broadly covers machines that can perform tasks requiring human-like intelligence. Machine Learning trains systems to learn from data. Deep Learning uses multi-layered neural networks to recognize complex patterns. Generative AI goes one step further. It doesn’t just analyze data or perform tasks, it creates new content: text, images, code, music, and more.

I was among the early adopters of ChatGPT, just a few months after its public launch in late 2022. It was a defining moment in the history of technology, the first time we could produce analyses, insights, and even complete outputs simply by typing natural-language prompts, without programming or complex tools.

I knew immediately that this would change the world. However, this accessibility has created a double-edged sword. Today, the digital landscape is flooded with “AI experts,” unverified tutorials, and get-rich-quick schemes that often promote the misuse of these tools.

There is a vast amount of misinformation circulating, ranging from overhyped capabilities to fundamental misunderstandings of how Large Language Models (LLMs) process truth and data.

To move beyond the noise, it’s important to seek out education from rigorous, academically backed sources rather than social media trends. The goal when using Generative AI tools shouldn’t be just to generate text, but to understand the capabilities and limitations well enough to apply it securely.

I was in university when the Internet first became commercialized. My first job, in 1996, was selling Internet access to individuals and companies. I witnessed firsthand the anxiety, resistance, and eventual transformation that followed. Yes, the Internet eliminated certain jobs, but it created far more, and often better ones.

Generative AI is bringing a similar paradigm shift today. The key is not to fear it but to learn it, to develop the literacy and critical understanding to use it responsibly. A sentiment often shared among industry leaders during my Generative AI research has stayed with me ever since: “AI will not steal your job; a human using AI will.”

That sentence should be a constant reminder for everyone: life is an ongoing evolution. Technologies disrupt, jobs disappear, and new ones emerge. So the next time you hear someone say, “We need to get into AI,” ask, “Which AI?”

Traditional AI analyzes what already exists, and chances are, you and your company are already using it. Generative AI creates what’s next. This distinction matters. If you treat Generative AI like a search engine or a calculator, you miss its true potential. If you treat it as an absolute source of truth, you risk misuse.

That is why deep literacy is essential. Understanding the specific capabilities of these tools is an act of digital responsibility. By educating ourselves, grounding our knowledge in fact, and embracing change with intention, we prepare to lead this next technological era, not be replaced by it.
