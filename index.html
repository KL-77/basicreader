            <h2>LG's new subscription program charges up to £277 per month to rent a TV</h2>
            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-01-27</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2026/01/lgs-new-subscription-program-charges-up-to-277-per-month-to-rent-a-tv/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">LG has launched a subscription program in the UK that allows people to make monthly payments in order to rent LG TVs, soundbars, monitors, and speakers.

LG Flex customers can sign up for one, two, or three-year subscriptions in order to get lower monthly payments.

“At the end of your subscription, you can apply for a free upgrade, keep paying monthly, or return your device,” the LG Flex website says. Subscribers will have to pay a £50 (about $69) fee for a “full removal service,” including dismounting and packaging, of rental TVs.

LG also claims on its website that it won’t penalize customers for “obvious signs of use, such as some scratching, small dents, or changes in the paintwork.” However, if you damage the rental device, LG “may charge you for the cost of repair as outlined by the Repair Charges set out in your agreement.” LG’s subscription partner, Raylo, also sells insurance for coverage against “accidental damage, loss, and theft” of rented devices.

As of this writing, you can buy LG’s 83-inch OLED B5 2025 TV on LG’s UK website for £2,550 (about $3,515). Monthly rental prices range from £93 ($128), if you commit to a three-year-long rental period, to £277 ($382), if you only commit to a one-month rental period. Under the three-year plan, you can rent the TV for 27 months before you end up paying more to rent the TV than you would have to own it. At the highest rate, your rental payments will surpass MSRP after nine months.

The cheapest item available through LG Flex as of this writing is LG’s 3.1.1 channel soundbar with Dolby Atmos from 2024. You can buy it from LG’s UK website for £600 ($827) or rent it for £22 ($30) to £76 ($105) per month.

LG Flex can grant people instant access to electronics they may not be able to pay for currently. There are other options, like interest-free payment programs (which LG also offers), but those programs can require larger monthly payments than rentals do.

Still, renting gadgets from LG won’t make financial sense for many. The program can be handy for people, businesses, and other entities that require high-end gadgets for a limited amount of time or that want frequent upgrades. But renting electronics quickly becomes more costly than buying something. It’s often more prudent to save money that would have been used for monthly payments and instead invest it in something that you can own and maintain for years.

LG’s rental gadgets are only available in the UK. Ars Technica reached out to LG about whether it has plans to rent electronics in the US and will update this article if we hear back. As it stands, the program adds to a slowly growing number of tech companies encouraging people to rent, instead of buy, their products. HP, for instance, has a printer rental program, and NZXT launched a gaming desktop rental program in 2024. Logitech CEO Hanneke Faber has also floated the idea of a subscription-based mouse.

LG Flex is just one example of how the Seoul-headquartered company is finding creative ways to build recurring revenue instead of relying solely on sales of its expensive gadgets, as such purchases occur sparingly and less predictably. Last year, LG launched a similar rental program for home appliances in Singapore and Malaysia.</div>

            <h2>“IG is a drug”: Internal messages may doom Meta at social media addiction trial</h2>
            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-01-27</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2026/01/tiktok-settles-hours-before-landmark-social-media-addiction-trial-starts/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Anxiety, depression, eating disorders, and death. These can be the consequences for vulnerable kids who get addicted to social media, according to more than 1,000 personal injury lawsuits that seek to punish Meta and other platforms for allegedly prioritizing profits while downplaying child safety risks for years.

Social media companies have faced scrutiny before, with Congressional hearings forcing CEOs to apologize, but until now, they’ve never had to convince a jury that they aren’t liable for harming kids.

This week, the first high-profile lawsuit—considered a “bellwether” case that could set meaningful precedent in the hundreds of other complaints—goes to trial. That lawsuit documents the case of a 19-year-old, K.G.M, who hopes the jury will agree that Meta and YouTube caused psychological harm by designing features like infinite scroll and autoplay to push her down a path that she alleged triggered depression, anxiety, self-harm, and suicidality.

TikTok and Snapchat were also targeted by the lawsuit, but both have settled. The Snapchat settlement came last week, while TikTok settled on Tuesday just hours before the trial started, Bloomberg reported.

For now, YouTube and Meta remain in the fight. K.G.M. allegedly started watching YouTube when she was 6 years old and joined Instagram by age 11. She’s fighting to claim untold damages—including potentially punitive damages—to help her family recoup losses from her pain and suffering and to punish social media companies and deter them from promoting harmful features to kids. She also wants the court to require prominent safety warnings on platforms to help parents be aware of the risks.

A loss could cost social media companies billions, CNN reported.

To avoid that, platforms have alleged that other factors caused K.G.M.’s psychological harm—like school bullies and family troubles—while insisting that Section 230 and the First Amendment protect platforms from being blamed for any harmful content targeted to K.G.M.

They also argued that K.G.M.’s mom never read the terms of service and, therefore, supposedly would not have benefited from posted warnings. And ByteDance, before settling, seemingly tried to pass the buck by claiming that K.G.M. “already suffered mental health harms before she began using TikTok.”

But the judge, Carolyn B. Kuhl, wrote in a ruling denying all platforms’ motions for summary judgment that K.G.M. showed enough evidence that her claims don’t stem from content to go to trial.

Further, platforms can’t liken warnings buried in terms of service to prominently displayed warnings, Kuhl said, since K.G.M.’s mom testified she would’ve restricted the minor’s app usage if she were aware of the alleged risks.

Two platforms settling before the trial seems like a good sign for K.G.M. However, Snapchat has not settled other social media addiction lawsuits that it’s involved in, including one raised by school districts, and perhaps is waiting to see how K.G.M.’s case shakes out before taking further action.

To win, K.G.M.’s lawyers will need to “parcel out” how much harm is attributed to each platform, due to design features, not the content that was targeted to K.G.M., Clay Calvert, a technology policy expert and senior fellow at a think tank called the American Enterprise Institute, wrote. Internet law expert Eric Goldman told The Washington Post that detailing those harms will likely be K.G.M.’s biggest struggle, since social media addiction has yet to be legally recognized, and tracing who caused what harms may not be straightforward.

However, Matthew Bergman, founder of the Social Media Victims Law Center and one of K.G.M.’s lawyers, told the Post that K.G.M. is prepared to put up this fight.

“She is going to be able to explain in a very real sense what social media did to her over the course of her life and how in so many ways it robbed her of her childhood and her adolescence,” Bergman said.

The research is unclear on whether social media is harmful for kids or whether social media addiction exists, Tamar Mendelson, a professor at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, told the Post. And so far, research only shows a correlation between Internet use and mental health, Mendelson noted, which could doom K.G.M.’s case and others.

However, social media companies’ internal research might concern a jury, Bergman told the Post. On Monday, the Tech Oversight Project, a nonprofit working to rein in Big Tech, published a report analyzing recently unsealed documents in K.G.M.’s case that supposedly provide “smoking-gun evidence” that platforms “purposefully designed their social media products to addict children and teens with no regard for known harms to their wellbeing&quot;—while putting increased engagement from young users at the center of their business models.

In the report, Sacha Haworth, executive director of The Tech Oversight Project, accused social media companies of “gaslighting and lying to the public for years.”

Most of the recently unsealed documents highlighted in the report came from Meta, which also faces a trial from dozens of state attorneys general on social media addiction this year.

Those documents included an email stating that Mark Zuckerberg—who is expected to testify at K.G.M.’s trial—decided that Meta’s top priority in 2017 was teens who must be locked in to using the company’s family of apps.

The next year, a Facebook internal document showed that the company pondered letting “tweens” access a private mode inspired by the popularity of fake Instagram accounts teens known as “finstas.” That document included an “internal discussion on how to counter the narrative that Facebook is bad for youth and admission that internal data shows that Facebook use is correlated with lower well-being (although it says the effect reverses longitudinally).”

Other allegedly damning documents showed Meta seemingly bragging that “teens can’t switch off from Instagram even if they want to” and an employee declaring, “oh my gosh yall IG is a drug,” likening all social media platforms to “pushers.”

Similarly, a 2020 Google document detailed the company’s plan to keep kids engaged “for life,” despite internal research showing young YouTube users were more likely to “disproportionately” suffer from “habitual heavy use, late night use, and unintentional use” deteriorating their “digital well-being.”

Shorts, YouTube’s feature that rivals TikTok, also concerns parents suing, and three years later, documents showed Google choosing to target teens with Shorts, despite research flagging that the “two biggest challenges for teen wellbeing on YouTube” were prominently linked to watching shorts. Those challenges included Shorts bombarding teens with “low quality content recommendations that can convey & normalize unhealthy beliefs or behaviors” and teens reporting that “prolonged unintentional use” was “displacing valuable activities like time with friends or sleep.”

Bergman told the Post that these documents will help the jury decide if companies owed young users better protections sooner but prioritized profits while pushing off interventions that platforms have more recently introduced amid mounting backlash.

“Internal documents that have been held establishing the willful misconduct of these companies are going to—for the first time—be given a public airing,” Bergman said. “The public is going to know for the first time what social media companies have done to prioritize their profits over the safety of our kids.”

One seeming advantage K.G.M. has heading into the trial is that tech companies failed to get expert testimony that backs up her claims dismissed.

Platforms tried to exclude testimony from several experts, including Kara Bagot, a board-certified adult, child, and adolescent psychiatrist, as well as Arturo Bejar, a former Meta safety researcher and whistleblower. They claimed that experts’ opinions were irrelevant because they were based on K.G.M.’s interactions with content. They also suggested that child safety experts’ opinions “violate the standards of reliability” since the causal links they draw don’t account for “alternative explanations” and allegedly “contradict the experts’ own statements in non-litigation contexts.”

However, Kuhl ruled that platforms will have the opportunity to counter experts’ opinions at trial, while reminding social media companies that “ultimately, the critical question of causation is one that must be determined by the jury.” Only one expert’s testimony was excluded, Social Media Victims Law Center noted, a licensed clinical psychologist deemed unqualified.

“Testimony by Bagot as to design features that were employed on TikTok as well as on other social media platforms is directly relevant to the question of whether those design features cause the type of harms allegedly suffered by K.G.M. here,” Kuhl wrote.

That means that a jury will get a chance to weigh Bagot’s opinion that “social media overuse and addiction causes or plays a substantial role in causing or exacerbating psychopathological harms in children and youth, including depression, anxiety and eating disorders, as well as internalizing and externalizing psychopathological symptoms.”

The jury will also consider Bejar’s insights as a fact witness sharing information about Meta’s internal safety studies as a former consultant and researcher for the company. That includes hearing about “his personal knowledge and experience related to how design defects on Meta’s platforms can cause harm to minors (e.g., age verification, reporting processes, beauty filters, public like counts, infinite scroll, default settings, private messages, reels, ephemeral content, and connecting children with adult strangers),” as well as “harms associated with Meta’s platforms including addiction/problematic use, anxiety, depression, eating disorders, body dysmorphia, suicidality, self-harm, and sexualization.”

If K.G.M. can convince the jury that she was not harmed by platforms failing to remove content but by companies “designing their platforms to addict kids” and “developing algorithms that show kids not what they want to see but what they cannot look away from,” Bergman thinks her case could become a “data point” for “settling similar cases en masse,” he told Barrons.

“She is very typical of so many children in the United States—the harms that they’ve sustained and the way their lives have been altered by the deliberate design decisions of the social media companies,” Bergman told the Post.</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Large swathes of the US were blanketed in snow and ice over the weekend, and what better way to spend a snow day than going down a YouTube rabbit hole? Everyone has their favorite oddity: ASMR, jazzy pop song covers, cooking channels, or what have you. But DIY enthusiasts in particular are missing out if they’re not watching Drain Cleaning Australia, featuring an Australian plumber known only as Bruce as he goes about his daily business of shooting high-powered water jets into stubborn clogged drainage systems. It’s “the YouTube channel you never knew you needed.” And it’s done so well that he’s now launched a second channel, Bruce the Plumber.

I stumbled upon the Drain Cleaning Australia channel via Amy Poehler‘s Good Hang podcast episode with Kate McKinnon, who is a big fan and does a dead-on delivery of Bruce’s trademark lines (“You little rippah!”). Bruce never appears in his videos, apart from his hands and the occasional shadow as he films various challenging jobs with his intrepid smartphone. He seems to have struck a good balance between online popularity and protecting his personal privacy. (Bruce did not respond to our interview request. It’s okay, mate, we know all those drains Down Under aren’t going to unclog themselves.)

Armed with his trusty collection of jet nozzles and “Mister Plungey,” Bruce has removed all manner of nasty things from drains over the years: masses of human hair from shower drains; tree roots; plastic bags and other refuse that somehow found their way into drainage systems; and the less said about the many clogged toilets, the better.

My personal favorites are when Bruce takes on clogged restaurant grease traps, including the one at the top of this article in which he pulls out a massive greaseberg “the size of a chihuahua.” When it’s Bruce versus a nasty grease trap, the man remains undefeated (well, almost—sometimes he needs to get a grease trap pumped out before he can fix the problem). And I have learned more than I probably ever needed to know about how grease traps work.

Each video is its own little adventure. Bruce arrives on a job, checks out the problem (“she is chock-a-block, mate!”), and starts methodically working that problem until he solves it, which inevitably involves firing up “the bloody jet” to blast through blockages with 5,000 psi of water pressure (“Go, you good thing!”). This being Australia, he’ll occasionally encounter not just cockroaches but poisonous spiders and snakes. And he’s caught so many facefulls of wastewater and sewage while jetting that he really ought to invest in a hazmat suit. Even the cheesy canned techno-music playing during lulls in the action is low-budget perfection.

Bruce isn’t the only plumber with a YouTube channel—it’s a surprisingly good-size subgenre—but he’s the most colorful and entertaining. His unbridled enthusiasm for what many would consider the dirtiest of jobs is positively infectious. He regularly effuses about having the best job in the world, insisting that unclogging gross drains is “living the dream,” and regularly asks his audience, “How good is this? I mean, where else would you rather be?” Sure, he says it with an ironic (unseen) wink at the camera, but deep down, you know he truly loves the work.

And you know what? Bruce is right. It might not be your definition of “what dreams are made of,” but there really is something profoundly satisfying about a free-flowing drain—and a job well done.</div>

            <div id="article-text">It can be hard sometimes to keep up with the deluge of generative AI in Google products. Even if you try to avoid it all, there are some features that still manage to get in your face. Case in point: AI Overviews. This AI-powered search experience has a reputation for getting things wrong, but you may notice some improvements soon. Google says AI Overviews is being upgraded to the latest Gemini 3 models with a more conversational bent.

In just the last year, Google has radically expanded the number of searches on which you get an AI Overview at the top. Today, the chatbot will almost always have an answer for your query, which has relied mostly on models in Google’s Gemini 2.5 family. There was nothing wrong with Gemini 2.5 as generative AI models go, but Gemini 3 is a little better by every metric.

There are, of course, multiple flavors of Gemini 3, and Google doesn’t like to be specific about which ones appear in your searches. What Google does say is that AI Overviews chooses the right model for the job. So if you’re searching for something simple for which there are a lot of valid sources, AI Overviews may manifest something like Gemini 3 Flash without running through a ton of reasoning tokens. For a complex “long tail” query, it could step up the thinking or move to Gemini 3 Pro (for paying subscribers).

Make no mistake—Gemini 3 can still make mistakes like any other gen AI system. That said, it does get things right more often than the previous model. The lightweight Gemini 3 Flash model more than doubled its score in knowledge-based benchmarks compared to the 2.5 branch. Since you really can’t get away from AI Overviews (without leaving Google), it’s at least nice Google is deploying models that get things right more often.

As part of this update, Google is also pushing AI Mode even harder by creating a bridge between it and AI Overviews. Google says that testers prefer an experience that can move naturally from a search paradigm to a conversational one. Thus, AI Overviews will gain the ability to hand off follow-up questions to AI Mode.

According to Google, this “fluid” experience is better at giving people what they want when they type something into the search bar—a quick factoid or a deep conversation. However, the expansion of AI Mode into the traditional search experience will also continue to pull people away from Google’s increasingly forsaken list of blue links. AI Mode may be scraping its content from those sites, but it keeps users bottled up in the Google bubble. That’s search in the AI era.</div>

            <h2>Volvo invented the three-point seat belt 67 years ago; now it has improved it</h2>
            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-01-27</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2026/01/how-volvos-new-adaptive-seat-belts-will-reduce-injuries-during-a-crash/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">With the launch of its all-new, all-electric EX60, Volvo has put lessons learned from the EX30 and EX90 to use. The EX60 is built on Volvo’s new SPA3 platform, made only for battery-electric vehicles. It boasts up to 400 miles (643 km) of range, with fast-charging capabilities Volvo says add 173 miles (278 km) in 10 minutes. Mega casting reduces the number of parts of the rear floor from 100-plus to one piece crafted of aluminum alloy, reducing complexities and weld points.

Inside the cabin, however, the real achievement is Volvo’s new multi-adaptive safety belt. Volvo has a history with the modern three-point safety belt, which was perfected by in-house engineer Nils Bohlin in 1959 before the patent was shared with the world. Today at the Volvo Cars Safety Center lab, at least one brand-new Volvo is crashed every day in the name of science. The goal: to test not just how well its vehicles are protecting passengers but what the next frontier is in safety technology.

Senior Safety Technical Leader Mikael Ljung Aust is a driving behavior specialist with 20 years under his belt at Volvo. He says it’s easy to optimize testing toward one person or one test point and come up with a good result. However, both from the behavioral perspective and from physics, people are different. What’s not different, he points out, is how people drive.

“We’re shaped into a very similar automated behavior when we drive, so that makes the collision prevention side of things a bit easier,” Ljung Aust says. “But on the injury-prevention side of things is where the seat belt comes in, we’re working on the principle of equal safety for all. The idea is that independent of who you are in terms of size, shape, weight, all of these things, you should have exactly the same protection.”

Basically, a seat belt is made up of a retractor mechanism, buckle assembly, webbing material, and a pretensioner device. Of these parts, the pretensioner is the one tasked with tightening the seatbelt webbing in a collision. As such, it reduces the forward movement of the passenger before the airbag deploys at speeds of up to 200 mph (321 km/h). All of these parts remain the same for Volvo’s newest seat belt iteration. It’s the tiny brain attached to the assemblage that’s different.

Volvo’s new central computing system, HuginCore (named after a bird in Norse mythology), runs the EX60 with more than 250 trillion operations per second. It has been developed in-house, together with its partners Google, Nvidia, and Qualcomm.

“With the HuginCore system we can collect a lot of data and make decisions in the car instantly and combine that with the belt’s ability to choose different load levels,” says Åsa Haglund, head of the Volvo Cars Safety Center. “A box of possibilities opens up where you can detect what type of crash it is and who is in the car and choose a more optimal belt force.”

Load limiters control how much force the safety belt applies on the human body during a crash. Volvo’s new system pushes the load-limiting profiles from three to 11, marking a major increase in adjustability. It’s kind of like an audio system, Ljung Aust muses. A sound system with 10 discrete steps up the volume ladder offers varied profiles along the way, while one with only one or two steps addresses fewer preference levels.

Using data from exterior, interior, and crash sensors, the car reacts to a collision in milliseconds—less than the blink of an eye, Ljung Aust says. In the case of a crash, it’s critical to hold the hips into the car, he explains, but the upper body should fold forward in a frontal crash in a nice, smooth motion to meet the airbag. Otherwise, the body is exposed to the same force as the slowing car.

Tempering that motion means adjusting for the size of the passenger to avoid injury; for instance, if the sensors detect a larger occupant in a severe crash, it’s designed to reduce the risk of head injury by using a higher belt load setting. Conversely, a smaller passenger in a lesser fender bender gets a lower belt load setting to reduce the incidence of rib fractures. Haglund notes that while one might make assumptions about what body type is more vulnerable in a crash, it has more to do with the kind of crash itself.

There is no one-size-fits-all approach to crash safety, but the multi-adaptive seat belt is a closer step toward individual protection. Ljung Aust likens the new seat belt system to an octopus; the “tentacles” are the sensors that feed information to the brain. From there, the processor collects the data that Volvo uses to make improvements over time. Over-the-air updates will send future improvements to the car’s HuginCore system.

The timing is where artificial intelligence plays a big part. For every crash, there is an optimal set of outcomes to trigger the belt force. The result needs to happen like that, he says with a snap of his fingers.

Modern safety belts use load limiters to control how much force the safety belt applies on the human body during a crash. But with the new safety belt’s expanded load-limiting profiles, it can optimize performance for each situation and individual. “What is changing is the level of sophistication in how we act on that information,” Ljung Aust says. “We can now be more nuanced with the forces we apply to keep you under the lowest pressure possible [in a crash].”

Not enough people know how a seat belt works, says Ljung Aust, and they should.

“If you find out how it works, you realize it’s pretty cool and it actually makes a difference,” he says. “And to the extent that you were not inclined to wear it before or not be happy about it, maybe that has a positive influence on your attitude. Having a seat belt is literally the best thing you can do.”</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">When Apple stops supporting older iPhones and iPads with the latest version of iOS or iPadOS, it usually isn’t the end of the line—Apple keeps releasing new security-only patches for those devices for another year or two, keeping them usable while their hardware is still reasonably capable.

Once those updates dry up, it’s rare for Apple to revisit those older operating systems, but the company does sometimes make exceptions. That was the case yesterday, when the company released a batch of updates for long-retired iOS and iPadOS versions that otherwise hadn’t seen a new patch in months or years. Those updates include iOS 12.5.8, available for devices as old as 2013’s iPhone 5S and 2014’s iPhone 6; iOS 15.8.6, available for devices like the iPhone 6S, iPhone 7, and iPad Air 2; and iOS 16.7.13, available for devices like the iPhone 8 and iPhone X.

Both iOS 15 and iOS 16 were last patched in mid-2025, but iOS 12’s last patch was released in January 2023.

These updates don’t patch security flaws or add new features. According to Apple’s release notes for the iOS 12 and iOS 15 updates, all they do is update a security certificate to ensure that iMessage, FaceTime, and Apple account sign-in will continue working past January 2027, when the operating systems’ original certificate would have expired.

Apple’s iOS 18.7.4 update also changes out the certificate, though that update is less surprising, since iOS 18 is still being actively patched for the iPhone XS, iPhone XR, and other devices that can’t run iOS 26. Oddly, the iOS 16 update doesn’t mention the security certificate, and there’s no equivalent update for devices stuck on iOS 17.

Devices running old iOS versions like iOS 12, 15, and 16 are difficult, if not impossible, to use as general-purpose smartphones and tablets these days. Many of these devices have just 1 or 2GB of RAM, and their built-in Safari versions will be missing features and security patches needed to browse the modern Internet safely. Third-party apps also mostly stop supporting old iOS versions after a year or two.

But plenty of old iPhones and iPads find second or third lives as single-use appliances and simple messaging devices—up until just a couple of years ago, my own iPhone 5S served as a kid’s white noise machine on overnight trips. I wouldn’t call these 12- and 13-year-old phones and tablets “actively supported,” but it’s nice to see Apple commit to keeping them minimally functional over such an extended period.</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The Department of Defense might be the first government agency to roll out a department-wide AI chatbot, but the Department of Transportation is about to be the first to draft actual binding regulations with the tech.

According to a new investigation by ProPublica, the top transportation agency has tapped Google Gemini to help write new regulations affecting aviation, automotive, railroad, and maritime safety. In internal communications from DoT attorney Daniel Cohen, agency staffers were presented with the plan along with a demonstration of AI’s “potential to revolutionize the way we draft rulemakings.”

The AI demonstration, Cohen enthused, would show off “exciting new AI tools available to DOT rule writers to help us do our job better and faster.”

His focus, disturbingly, was explicitly that AI is fast, even if it isn’t particularly accurate.

“We don’t need the perfect rule on XYZ. We don’t even need a very good rule on XYZ,” DoT general counsel Gregory Zerzan said, according to the recent meeting notes obtained by ProPublica. “We want good enough,” he said. “We’re flooding the zone.”

In addition, Zerzan noted that enthusiasm for the DoT AI tool runs all the way to the top, noting that Donald Trump is “very excited about this initiative.”

Six DoT workers who spoke to ProPublica anonymously said that typical regulation-writing can take months, and sometimes years, due to the complications involved. But at the demonstration in December, a presenter told them Google’s Gemini could cut that down to “minutes or even seconds.”

Zerzan, for his part, told DoT staffers that the goal is to be able to pump out a new regulation in as little as 30 days. “It shouldn’t take you more than 20 minutes to get a draft rule out of Gemini,” he told regulators.

Asked for his opinion by ProPublica, the DoT’s former chief AI officer Mike Horton compared the plan to “having a high school intern that’s doing your rulemaking.”

For anyone worried about keeping trains on the tracks and planes in the sky, it’s an incredibly troubling development. Large language models (LLMs) like Gemini are prone to errors known as hallucinations. Gemini has been linked to a number of embarrassing episodes, like hallucinating marriages that don’t exist or making up dangerous medical misinformation.

And that’s without getting into how, in April of last year, Gemini users were perturbed as the chatbot abruptly started spitting out screeds that read like disturbing psychological breaks — the last thing you want when dealing with federal regulations on activities as crucial as air traffic control.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Nations that defy the US-led world order may soon face a new weapon designed to hamstring defenses, disorient troops, and sow fear into the hearts of its enemies.

In a familiarly bizarre interview with the New York Post, president Donald Trump revealed that US troops had used what he colorfully termed a secret “discombobulator” during the air attack on Caracas, Venezuela earlier this month.

“The discombobulator. I’m not allowed to talk about it,” Trump told the Post. “I would love to,” he said, before claiming that, whatever it is, the device was used in Venezuela. As for what exactly it is, the president was pretty vague.

In the interview, Trump bragged that the device “made [Venezuelan] equipment not work” during the brutal offensive that killed about 100 people and led to the unlawful kidnapping of Venezuelan president Nicolás Maduro. “They never got their rockets off. They had Russian and Chinese rockets, and they never got one off. We came in, they pressed buttons and nothing worked. They were all set for us.”

As a senior US official told CNN, Trump seems to be conflating a few different systems into one weapon. For example, the US did sabotage Venezuela’s electrical infrastructure and air defense radar systems in a powerful cyberattack, per the New York Times. The White House has also claimed that Venezuelan troops suffered from a “very intense sound wave” during the attack, a likely reference to the Active Denial System, an anti-personnel weapon designed to heat human flesh on contact.

The US wasn’t just interested in knocking out Venezuela’s military capabilities. Civilian infrastructure, such as the Venezuelan Institute for Scientific Research (IVIC), was also deliberately targeted in the blitz. Though it was 11 miles away from the closest military installation, the IVIC suffered extensive damage to its mathematics, physics, chemistry, ecology, and nuclear research buildings.

US troops also targeted the La Guaira port in Caracas, the country’s main international shipping hub. According to the publication Venezuela Analysis, medical warehouses belonging to the Venezuelan Social Security Institute were among the targets at La Guaira.

That situation has prompted an emergency response from health authorities in Brazil, who are mobilizing to send badly needed dialysis supplies and medicine to Venezuela.

In a statement to local press, Nelare Bermúdez, an official with La Guaira state’s healthcare authority, said that at least a three-month supply of medicine for kidney disease treatment had been destroyed. Yet if the discombobulator was meant to scare Venezuelans into submission, Bermúdez’s resolve suggests otherwise: “we remain undeterred in our fight to guarantee these health services,” he said.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">In a memo sent out to staff last month, OpenAI CEO issued a “code red” urging employees to double down on improving the company’s flagship product ChatGPT, as financial pressure loomed and competitors gained ground.

The company continues to frantically chase some much-needed revenue. Despite Altman calling ads a “last resort for us as a business model” in 2024, the company announced earlier this month that ChatGPT will soon start spamming users with them.

Its cash burn rate is immense. The company is planning to spend well over $1 trillion in the coming years on data center infrastructure, despite revenue lagging far behind. Experts have warned that the company could run out of cash within the next 18 months. To its most skeptical critics, it’s an Enron-like financial disaster that’s waiting to happen.

So maybe it’s not surprising that the company is opting to pump the brakes. During a livestreamed town hall event on Monday, Altman said that OpenAI is looking to “dramatically slow down” hiring as the company continues to lose billions of dollars each quarter, as Business Insider reports.

“What I think we shouldn’t do, and what I hope other companies won’t do either, is hire super aggressively, then realize all of a sudden AI can do a lot of stuff, and you need fewer people, and have to have some sort of very uncomfortable conversation,” Altman told attendees. “So I think the right approach for us will be to hire more slowly but keep hiring.”

The news comes amid widespread concerns over soaring unemployment in the US. While consumer spending has increased, the labor market has been hit hard by businesses curbing hiring significantly, often citing heavy investments in AI.

Altman’s admission also suggests that several years of aggressive hiring in the AI sector could be screeching to a halt as the industry continues to face pressure from investors getting antsy about the waning prospects of a return.

The news is particularly notable after years of AI companies embracing an unprecedented hiring spree, desperately trying to poach talent from their competitors by offering them astronomical pay packages.

Whether Altman’s announcement signals that those days are over for good remains to be seen. Big tech’s spending binge is set to drag on in the coming years. Many have already made massive commitments to scale up operations by expanding enormous data centers.

At the same time, selling those future prospects to investors could become more difficult as well. OpenAI, for instance, is already struggling with stalling subscriber growth — and that’s before pestering its users with ads or paywalling existing features behind expensive monthly subscriptions. (The company is currently mulling over how much to charge for ads.)

As former Fidelity manager George Noble fulminated in a scorching thread on X, the AI industry may have already hit a point of diminishing returns. Companies still have a lot to prove — for instance, chatbots still suffer from rampant hallucinations — as the goalposts continue to be moved.

“The low-hanging fruit is gone,” he wrote. “Every incremental improvement now requires exponentially more compute, more data centers, more power.”

Meanwhile, Google — one of OpenAI’s biggest competitors — can rely on an already-established business with existing revenue streams to prop up its AI spending.

In short, Altman’s significant hiring slowdown could be indicative of a tough time ahead. And if critics are to be believed, the wheels could already be starting to come off.

            <div id="article-text">We’re just days away from NASA’s historic return to the Moon.

The agency’s Artemis 2 mission will see a crew of four astronauts travel far beyond the dark side of the Earth’s natural satellite, reaching the farthest point that humans have ever traveled from Earth. They will get unfettered views of the Moon’s surface during the flyby, getting within just 4,600 miles of its far side, before making their four-day return to Earth.

On Friday, the four astronauts officially entered quarantine in preparation for the mission, a conventional precaution ahead of any prolonged trips into space, to “ensure that they don’t pick up any illness that could delay their mission by limiting their exposure to others in the days before they lift off,” as NASA explained.

“This period, called the health stabilization program, typically starts about 14 days before launch,” the agency wrote. “Beginning quarantine now preserves flexibility as teams work toward potential opportunities in the February launch period.”

The team will still be allowed to be in contact with their friends and family, as long as they “observe quarantine guidelines… avoid public places, wear masks, and maintain distance from others they come into contact with,” per the agency.

NASA will conduct its wet dress rehearsal (WDR) in advance of a launch as early as January 31. The rehearsal is designed to run through the entire launch — while the astronauts are still in quarantine — to ensure that all systems are go.

If all goes according to plan, the agency’s Space Launch System rocket could launch as early as February 6, though an official date has yet to be announced.

However, the rocket has already been rolled out to historic Launch Complex-39B at Kennedy Space Center, alongside the Orion spacecraft that will carry the crew into space.

It’s an exciting prospect, as it’ll be the first time humans have ventured to the Moon in over half a century.

“Artemis 2 will be a momentous step forward for human spaceflight,” said NASA administrator Jared Isaacman in a recent statement. “This historic mission will send humans farther from Earth than ever before and deliver the insights needed for us to return to the Moon — all with America at the helm.”

The space agency’s follow-up mission, Artemis 3, could allow the first astronauts to walk on the lunar surface since Apollo 17 in December 1972.

The mission is scheduled to launch sometime next year, but NASA has plenty of decisions to make — like which spacecraft to pick to carry the crew from lunar orbit down to the surface.

            <div id="article-text">Tesla CEO and billionaire Elon Musk has long garnered a reputation for being massively wrong in his promises and predictions about the future.

In 2024, for instance, he said that AI would become “smarter than the smartest human” by 2025. He said his company’s SpaceX Starship rocket, which is still exploding during test flights, will land on Mars this year. Like clockwork, he’s predicted that self-driving cars will become a reality “next year” every year for well over a decade now. He promised robotaxis without human safety monitors by mid-2025, which the company still has yet to accomplish.

We could go on and on. In short, it’d be far easier to count the occasions on which he’s been right than when he’s been wrong.

Now, as NBC News reports, users on online prediction markets like Kalshi and Polymarket are making big bucks off of Musk’s astonishing track record for being wrong about the future. Case in point, Polymarket user David Bensoussan made a ten percent return after betting $10,000 that Musk wouldn’t follow through on his threat of forming a new political party following his falling out with president Donald Trump.

He also successfully bet against Musk’s prediction that Tesla would launch an “unsupervised” version of its erroneously-named “Full Self-Driving” software by the end of 2025.

To Bensoussan, it’s a matter of principle.

“He does have a solid fan base, and so if I can help separate them from some of their money, I’m always happy to do that,” he told NBC. “He has a habit of exaggerating timelines, and of saying he’s going to do these amazing things and attaching more immediacy than what his intent may necessarily be.”

It’s an ironic inversion of the ethos of many of Musk’s investors, who have long warned to never bet against the mercurial CEO.

In total, Bensoussan’s ploy to bet against Musk’s wildly optimistic predictions has paid off, garnering him over $36,000.

Online prediction markets have surged in popularity in recent years. While benefitting from a largely unfettered regulatory vacuum, sites like Polymarket and Kalshi have also become embroiled in major insider trading controversies. Case in point, earlier this year, an anonymous bettor netted a cool $410,000 after accurately predicting the Trump administration’s attacks on Venezuela mere hours before Trump issued orders authorizing the strikes.

Even Musk himself has frequently voiced his support for prediction markets. His AI company, xAI, has deep integrations of both Kalshi and Polymarket.

But as it turns out, actively betting against his many attempts to reassure investors that a major technological revolution is just around the corner — a gambit that has largely worked out for him in the past — could be pretty lucrative.

As for current predictions, the online platforms aren’t exactly eager to stand behind his latest prophecies. For instance, only 13 percent of Kalshi users believe Musk will make good on his recent threat to buy airline Ryanair by the end of this year. The airline’s CEO, Michael O’Leary, had questioned the economics of adding SpaceX Starlink internet to airliners, resulting in petty name-calling.

As NBC points out, Musk also tried to manipulate prediction markets by calling a bet on Polymarket that Tesla will launch a robotaxi service before July 2025 a “money-making opportunity.”

Markets expectedly rose, with odds tripling to about 40 percent.

However, as the rules stipulated, a robotaxi service would only count if it was open to the general public — something that only materialized well after July 2025 — leading to plenty of users getting “burned.”

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">A doctor who witnessed the brutal shooting of Alex Pretti by Border Patrol agents says that the agents didn’t even bother trying to save the victim’s life as he bled out on the ground — because they were too busy counting the bullet wounds.

The harrowing testimony, detailed in a sworn court filing, contradicts key details in the accounts given by the Department of Homeland Security and top officials in the Trump administration, which insist that the 37-year-old ICU nurse threatened agents and attempted to reach for his gun during an altercation in Minneapolis on Saturday.

According to the witness, a 29-year-old physician who isn’t identified by name in the court document, Pretti was yelling at the agents but did not attack them or brandish any sort of weapon before the situation escalated fatally.

“Suddenly, an ICE agent shoved him to the ground,” the witness said, referring to the Border Patrol officers. “My view of the altercation was partially obstructed, but after a few seconds, I saw at least four ICE agents point guns at the man. I then saw the agents shoot the man at least six or seven times.”

When he rushed to the scene and told Border Patrol he was a physician and wanted to attend to the victim, the agents demanded to see his physician’s license — “which I obviously didn’t have,” he said.

Shockingly, he noticed that “none of the ICE agents who were near the victim were performing CPR” despite him clearly being in “critical condition,” so the doctor continued his protests.

“Normally, I would not have been so persistent, but as a physician, I felt a professional and moral obligation to help this man,” he said, “especially since none of the agents were helping him.”

Once the agents finally let him through, the first red flag that jumped out at him was that the victim was lying on his side.

“That is not standard practice when a victim has been shot. Checking for a pulse and administering CPR is standard practice,” he said. “Instead of doing either of those things, the ICE agents appeared to be counting his bullet wounds.”

The doctor checked for a pulse, found that Pretti had none, and immediately began CPR. According to the physician, Pretti had at least three bullet wounds in his back, another on his upper left chest, and possibly one on his neck. The doctor left after EMS arrived at the scene and took charge.

He described how the scene had left him shaken afterwards.

“When I returned to my apartment, I was extremely distraught,” the doctor said. “I was sobbing and shaking uncontrollably.”

Soon, tear gas began to flood into his apartment from a protest outside, and he left to drive to a friend’s house, “still crying and shaking” and “barely able to speak.”

Pretti’s killing has added to the intense backlash against ICE and Border Patrol’s brutal crackdown in Minneapolis, where the federal agents have clashed with onlookers, rounded up both citizen and non-citizen children, and shot and killed another protestor, 37-year-old Renee Good.

Contradicting the mountains of video evidence taken at the scene, the DHS maintains that Pretti, a nurse that treated sick and wounded veterans at the Minneapolis VA Medical Center, “wanted to do maximum damage and massacre law enforcement.” Agency secretary Kristi Noem called his actions “domestic terrorism,” and White House Deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller accused him of being an “assassin.”

“The victim was not actively threatening ICE agents or the public — he was just yelling at the agents because he objected to ICE’s presence in our city,” he said in the filing.

“I am not sure when I will return to my apartment,” he added. “I do not feel safe in my city.”

            <h2>Anthropic and OpenAI CEOs condemn ICE violence, praise Trump</h2>
            <p><strong>TechCrunch | 2026-01-27</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/27/anthropic-and-openai-ceos-condemn-ice-violence-praise-trump/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">On a Monday night NBC News segment, Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei expressed concern over “some of the things we’ve seen in the last few days,” referring to the violence of Border Patrol agents in Minneapolis.

Amodei focused on the importance of preserving democracy at home, both on NBC and in a post on X that specifically called out “the horror we’re seeing in Minnesota.” On NBC, he said he’s a believer in arming democracies to defend against autocratic countries, and that “we need to defend our own democratic values at home.” He added that Anthropic has no contracts with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).

Meanwhile, in an internal Slack message to OpenAI employees that got leaked to the New York Times, Sam Altman said, “What’s happening with ICE is going too far.”

“Part of loving the country is the American duty to push back against overreach,” Altman wrote. “There is a big difference between deporting violent criminals and what’s happening now, and we need to get the distinction right.”

Tech workers, including employees of both companies, have been calling on their chiefs to call the White House and demand that ICE leave U.S. cities in the aftermath of Border Patrol agents killing two U.S. citizens in Minneapolis. In an open letter, tech workers also urged their CEOs to cancel all company contracts with ICE and speak out publicly against ICE’s violence.

Employees calling for CEOs to take action are encouraged and want more to join the ranks.

“We’re glad to hear the CEOs of OpenAI and Anthropic condemning the ICE murders,” the ICEout.tech organizers, whose identities remain unknown, told TechCrunch. “Now we need to hear from CEOs of Apple, Google, Microsoft and Meta, all of whom have remained silent despite calls all across the industry.”

While Amodei and Altman may be taking something of a stand – one in public, the other internally – both CEOs couched their statements with praise for President Trump, as well.

Amodei applauded Trump’s consideration to allow Minnesota authorities to conduct an independent investigation into the shootings by federal agents after multiple videos of Alex Pretti’s death  circulated online. (It remains to be seen if that investigation will happen, but a growing number of Republicans have begun to call for an investigation, as well.)

In Altman’s message to his staff he also said he was encouraged by Trump’s more recent responses and said he hopes the president, “a very strong leader,” will “rise to this moment and unite the country.”

Altman assured them that OpenAI would “try to figure out how to actually do the right thing as best we can, engage with leaders and push for our values, and speak up clearly about it as needed.” Altman has yet to publicly criticize the administration’s immigration agenda, or how it is deploying Border Patrol agents into American cities.

J.J. Colao, founder of PR firm Haymaker Group and one of the signatories on ICEout.tech’s letter, called Altman out for trying to “have it both ways” by calling Trump a strong leader, “as if the president bears no responsibility for ICE’s actions.” He added: “On net, I think his statement is helpful, but the performative tribute to the president does a lot to diminish it.”

Of course, the Trump administration’s current AI-forward policies have helped fuel explosive growth at companies like OpenAI and Anthropic over the past year, OpenAI raised at least $40 billion and is in talks to raise another $100 billion at an $830 billion valuation, and Anthropic has raised $19 billion and is in talks to raise another $25 billion at a $350 billion valuation.

Still, such words of praise for Trump is an about face for Altman. In the lead up to Trump’s first term in 2016, Altman posted the following to his own blog:

“[Trump] is not merely irresponsible. He is irresponsible in the way dictators are…To anyone familiar with the history of Germany in the 1930s, it’s chilling to watch Trump in action.”

At that time, he called Trump a “demagogic hate-monger” who dangles the lie that he will “Make America Great by keeping us safe from outsiders” to distract from the fact that he actually has “no serious plan for how to restore economic growth.” Altman acknowledged that he took some risk by writing his post, and ended on a quote that has been attributed to Edmund Burke: “The only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing.”

“This would be a good time for us all—even Republicans, especially Republican politicians who previously endorsed Trump—to start speaking up,” he wrote.

And Amodei also appeared to be more passionate about his opposition to Trump allowing Nvidia to sell AI chips to China, calling the decision “crazy” last week during the World Economic Forum and likening it to “selling nuclear weapons to North Korea and [bragging that] Boeing made the casings.”

Whether these CEOs are doing everything that some among their workforce want them to do remains to be seen. Still, given what’s at stake for their companies, even internal and mild-mannered critiques are notable.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Google on Tuesday announced its more affordable Google AI Plus plan is now available in all markets where its AI plans are available. This includes the U.S, where it will cost $7.99 per month.

The expansion brings the lower-cost plan to 35 new countries and territories, after earlier launches in dozens of global markets, which began with Indonesia last September.

The plan includes access to Gemini 3 Pro and Nano Banana Pro in the Gemini app, Flow’s AI filmmaking tools, research and writing assistance in NotebookLM, and more. It also offers 200GB of storage and the ability to share your plan benefits with up to five other family members.

Existing Google One Premium 2TB subscribers will automatically gain access to all Google AI Plus plan benefits over the next few days, the company says.

Initially focused on emerging markets, the Google AI Plus plan is designed as the first step beyond free access to Gemini and other AI tools for those who either don’t need or can’t afford to subscribe to the more expensive Google AI Pro plan, which is typically priced at $20 per month.

While the Plus plan’s price point varies by region, its $8 per month price point could introduce a new, more casual audience to Google’s AI technology here in the United States. Elsewhere, the plan tends to cost less than $5 per month. For instance, users in India pay ₹399 ($4.44 USD) per month.

When it first debuted, Google explained that the plan was designed to bring access to Gemini, Veo, and other creative AI tools to emerging markets at a more affordable price point. It’s also designed to compete with OpenAI’s ChatGPT Go plan, which is $8 per month in the U.S., or less in some emerging markets. These plans are meant to attract the large online population of users who could become regular AI customers over time, giving companies a boost in their AI adoption numbers.

For the time being, subscribers can take 50% off for the first two months of their subscription in a promotional offering, Google says.

            <p><strong>TechCrunch | 2026-01-27</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/27/openai-launches-prism-a-new-ai-workspace-for-scientists/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">OpenAI launched on Tuesday a new scientific workspace program called Prism that is available for free to anyone with a ChatGPT account. Designed as an AI-enhanced word processor and research tool for scientific papers, Prism is deeply integrated with GPT-5.2, which can be used to assess claims, revise prose, or search for prior research.

Prism isn’t designed to conduct research on its own and without human guidance. Executives believe it will accelerate the work being done by human scientists and compared Prism to coding interfaces like Cursor and Windsurf.

“I think 2026 will be for AI and science what 2025 was for AI and software engineering,” Kevin Weill, VP of OpenAI for Science, said in a press call announcing the tool.

The new software, which is accessed via a web app, comes as OpenAI is seeing a flood of scientific queries coming to its consumer products like ChatGPT. The company says that ChatGPT receives an average of 8.4 million messages a week on advanced topics in the hard sciences — although it’s difficult to know how many are from professional researchers.

AI-assisted research is also becoming more common among academic researchers. In mathematics, AI models have been used to prove a number of long-standing Erdos problems through a combination of literature review and new applications of existing techniques. While the significance of the proofs is still hotly debated, the results have been an early victory for proponents of AI models and formal verification systems.

A statistics paper published in December used GPT 5.2 Pro to establish new proofs for a central axiom of statistical theory, with human researchers only prompting and verifying the model’s work. OpenAI applauded the result in a blog post, presenting it as a model for human-AI collaboration in research going forward.

“In domains with axiomatic theoretical foundations,” the post reads, “frontier models can help explore proofs, test hypotheses, and identify connections that might otherwise take substantial human effort to uncover.”

Much of the value of OpenAI’s new system comes from simple product work on existing standards. Prism integrates with LaTeX, an open-source system used to format and typeset scientific papers, but goes significantly beyond most available LaTeX software tools. The program also leverages GPT 5.2’s visual capabilities to allow researchers to assemble diagrams from online whiteboard drawings, which can be a significant pain point with existing tools.

Perhaps the most powerful feature comes from combining the usual powers of an AI model with more rigorous context management. When users open up a ChatGPT window through Prism, the model can access the full context of the research project, making responses both more germane and more intelligent.

Much of that would be possible for a savvy user of GPT-5.2, but OpenAI is hoping that a cleaner interface will draw in scientific researchers more quickly. Weill described it as the same combination of factors that made AI tools so powerful in software engineering.

“Software engineering accelerated in part because of amazing models,” he told reporters, “and in part because of deep workflow integration.”

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Imagine a world where your credit card no longer works, your Amazon account is shut down, and using U.S. tech companies is no longer an option. It’s almost impossible to shop online, wire bank transfers to an overseas family member, or rely on anything that involves the United States, including the U.S. dollar.

For one Canadian, this is now her reality.

Last year, the Trump administration added Kimberly Prost, a judge on the International Criminal Court, to its economic sanctions list, after she served on an appeals chamber that in 2020 unanimously authorized the ICC’s prosecutor to investigate alleged war crimes in Afghanistan since 2003, including U.S. service personnel. The United States is not a member of the ICC and does not recognize its authority. Several other ICC judges and prosecutors have also been sanctioned by the Trump administration.

Prost, whose name now shares the same list as some of the world’s most dangerous people, from terrorists to North Korean hackers and Iranian spies, described the effect of sanctions on her life as “paralyzing” in an interview by The Irish Times.

This high-profile case provides a glimpse into the disruption that being cut off from the U.S. can have on a person’s everyday life; lawmakers and government leaders across Europe are growing more aware of the looming threat facing them at home, and their over-reliance on U.S. technology.

Trump’s diplomatic escalations and the upending of international norms, including the capture a foreign leader and threatening to invade a NATO and European ally, have caused some EU countries to consider moving away from U.S. tech and reclaim their digital sovereignty. This shift in thinking comes as the Trump administration has become increasingly unpredictable and vindictive.

In Belgium, the country’s cybersecurity chief Miguel De Bruycker conceded in a recent interview that Europe has “lost the internet” to the United States, which has hoarded much of the world’s tech and financial systems. De Bruycker said it is “currently impossible” to store data fully in Europe as a result of U.S. dominating digital infrastructure, and urged the European Union to strengthen its tech across the bloc.

The European Parliament voted January 22 to adopt a report directing the European Commission to identify areas where the EU can reduce its reliance on foreign providers. Parliamentarians said the European Union and its 27 member states rely on non-EU countries for more than 80% of its digital products, services, and infrastructure. The vote was non-binding, but comes at a time when the European Commission is moving to bring more of its technologies and dependencies onto its own turf.

he French government said Tuesday it would replace Zoom and Microsoft Teams with its own domestically made video conferencing software Visio, according to the French minister for civil service and state reform David Amiel.

Concerns about digital sovereignty are not new and date back decades to at least 2001 when the U.S. introduced the Patriot Act in the aftermath of the September 11 terrorist attacks. The Patriot Act allowed U.S. intelligence agencies to surveil the world in ways it had never been allowed to before, including spying on the communications of citizens of its closest allies in Europe, despite the bloc’s strict data protection and privacy rules.

Microsoft conceded years later in 2011 that as an American tech company it could be compelled to hand over Europeans’ data in response to a secret U.S. government order; it wasn’t until 2013 when much of this surveillance was revealed in practice through classified documents leaked by then-NSA contractor Edward Snowden.

At the individual consumer level, there has also been a concerted push to urge users to switch away from U.S. tech providers and technologies, with tech workers calling on their chief executives to speak up against the rising brutality of U.S. federal immigration agents.

Independent journalist Paris Marx has a guide for getting off of U.S. tech services, while several other websites, such as Switch-to-EU and European Alternatives, encourage users to use alternatives to Big Tech products and services, such as open source tools.

But that gap is narrowing, according to new data published Tuesday by Obi, a company that aggregates real-time pricing and pick-up times across multiple ride-hailing services.

Two factors, working together, are behind the change. Waymo has lowered its pricing, at least in the San Francisco Bay Area where the data was pulled, while traditional ride-hailing rides on the Uber and Lyft networks have risen, according to Obi.

The new data was collected between November 27 and January 1, with Obi simulating more than 94,000 ride requests in the Bay Area. The company found that Waymo rides cost an average of $19.69, while Uber rides were slightly cheaper at $17.47. Lyft rides across the same period averaged $15.47.

In June, Obi released its first report analyzing robotaxi versus ride-hailing data. The data, which was taken from rides in April 2025, showed Waymo rides averaged $20.43, Uber landed at $15.58, and Lyft rides evened out at $14.44. Compared to these figures, Waymo’s average cost has dropped 3.62%, while Uber’s went up 12%, and Lyft’s climbed 7%.

Obi CEO Ashwini Anburajan told TechCrunch she believes this is a trend to watch because, while last April’s data implied customers were willing to pay a higher price to ride in a Waymo, the “novelty is wearing off for people in the Bay Area.” That means Waymo will likely keep having to price its offering more competitively, she said.

The wildcard in Obi’s new report is that it collected data on Tesla’s burgeoning robotaxi service, which appears to be far cheaper than these other three offerings. But there are a number of important caveats.

For one, Tesla isn’t technically operating a robotaxi service in the San Francisco area, where the data was sampled. Tesla doesn’t have the permits required to operate a driverless commercial robotaxi service in the state. Nor does it have a transportation network company permit like Uber or Lyft. Instead, Tesla has a transportation charter permit from the California Public Utilities Commission, which means the company uses employees to drive the company’s vehicles equipped with its Full Self-Driving software.

Tesla’s Bay Area fleet is also modest. Crowdsourced data from the website Robotaxi Tracker has helped log around 168 vehicles in Tesla’s ride-hail fleet, though not all of those cars are active all the time. (Obi notes in the report that only 156 were spotted by the crowdsourced website at the time the company ran its data sampling.)

That smaller fleet has driven by wait times. Of the four services surveyed, Tesla had the longest wait time with an average ETA of 15.32 minutes. Waymo’s average wait time was 5.74 minutes (up from 4.28 minutes last April), while Lyft and Uber came in at 5.14 minutes and 3.15 minutes, respectively.

These inputs — fleet size, human drivers, wait times — could have all affect how Tesla prices rides at true scale, and it’s hard to say when and how that might happen. Tesla only just recently pulled safety monitors out of a handful of cars in Austin, Texas.

If Tesla can scale its robotaxis — which rely on camera inputs alone — the company should theoretically be able to price rides lower than competitors like Waymo which, integrates its self-driving software into modified vehicles equipped with several different kinds of sensors.

Anburajan thinks there’s value in Tesla operating a ride-hailing service, ahead of any attempt at operating true robotaxis.

“It’s not really a autonomous vehicle at the moment. It has a safety driver in it. They’re building brand familiarity. They’re building brand preference for people that already like Teslas and people who are inclined to like Tesla,” she said.

There’s some evidence of this in the report Obi released Tuesday.

Along with the ride requests sampled in the Bay Area, Obi surveyed 2,000 people in California, Nevada, Arizona, and Texas on a number of issues related to robotaxis and ride-hailing. Over half of those respondents who had taken an autonomous vehicle ride said they’d ridden in a Tesla robotaxi. And when asked which autonomous brand they preferred the most, respondents chose Tesla 31% of the time.

Waymo was still the most preferred, with 39.8% of respondents choosing the Alphabet-owned brand. But this strong preference for Tesla, despite the company not operating a real robotaxi service at any scale yet, hints at future demand.

That strong preference for Tesla is also being driven in large part by a particular group: men. Women who were surveyed by Obi were essentially evenly split when it comes to choosing Waymo or Tesla, with Zoox a distant third at 8%. But 56% of men surveyed preferred Tesla to Waymo (25%) or Zoox (7%).

Obi’s report offers a good baseline ahead of a year that’s sure to see many developments in the world of autonomous vehicles. Waymo is rapidly expanding into new cities, even partnering with Uber and Lyft in some of them. Those ride-hail companies are bringing many other autonomous vehicle partners onto their platforms, too. And Tesla will likely look to prove its robotaxi approach works in order to expand its nascent offering.

Waymo is also about to start offering rides in a new van-like vehicle that it is building with Chinese company Zeekr. That vehicle, known as Ojai, is expected to have a lower up-front cost for Waymo and could allow the company to get more aggressive on pricing.

One thing is clear to Anburajan, though: real competition is coming. Other companies are preparing to launch their own robotaxi services. Nuro is supplying its self-driving system to modified Lucid Gravity vehicles as part of a premium robotaxi network that will be operated by Uber. Hyundai-backed Motional has rebooted its efforts and plans to launch a commercial robotaxi service in Las Vegas before the end of the year. And other companies like Avride have partnered with Uber to bring robotaxis to other U.S. cities.

“It’s still very early in the game, so no one’s a late entrant, right?” she said. “We’re in this new era, so who’s gonna capture market share and move fast to win consumers over?”

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Aylo, the parent company to some of the most popular tube sites like Pornhub, announced on Tuesday that it will restrict access to its platforms in the United Kingdom, effective February 2.

Since last year, Pornhub and other Aylo sites had complied with the UK’s Online Safety Act (OSA), which mandated — among other provisions — that websites with pornographic content verify the ages of visitors before showing them content that is inappropriate for minors.

Instead of complying with OSA by verifying the ages of its users, Aylo will block access to platforms like Pornhub in the U.K. altogether; however, U.K. users who have already verified their identity will still be able to use their accounts.

“Despite the clear intent of the law to restrict minors’ access to adult content and commitment to enforcement, after 6 months of implementation, our experience strongly suggests that the OSA has failed to achieve that objective,” Aylo said in a statement. “We believe this framework in practice has diverted traffic to darker, unregulated corners of the internet, and has also jeopardized the privacy and personal data of U.K. citizens.”

Ofcom, the UK regulator that enforces OSA, disagrees with Aylo’s characterization of the legislation.

“Porn services have a choice between using age checks to protect users as required under the Act, or to block access to their sites in the U.K.,” Ofcom said in a statement to TechCrunch. “There’s nothing to stop technology providers from developing solutions which work at the device level, and we would urge the industry to get on with that if they can evidence it is highly effective.”

Age verification technology has proven controversial as it rolls out across the globe. While children’s online safety is a pressing concern, privacy advocates argue that the type of cloud-based age verification methods mandated by legislation like OSA harms adults by collecting swaths of highly sensitive data.

“In other jurisdictions, Aylo has often been one of the only major platforms to comply, only to see traffic diverted to even larger, non-compliant sites,” the company said. Sites that do not comply with OSA are supposed to get fined, but Aylo claims that so far, only the forum 4chan has been fined.

Ofcom also disagrees with Aylo’s claim that it is not punishing porn sites for non-compliance.

“We’ve taken strong and swift action against non-compliance, launching investigations into more than 80 porn sites and fining a porn provider £1 million, with more to come,” Ofcom said.

The decision to block access in the U.K. is consistent with Aylo’s decisions around navigating compliance with age verification laws in the United States. Aylo’s websites are blocked in a number of U.S. states where age verification is mandated for adult content, since the company believes that age verification software opens the door to the threat of data breaches.

These fears are not unfounded. Pornhub was, in fact, vulnerable to a data breach at the web and mobile analytics provider Mixpanel, which exposed data about some Pornhub Premium subscribers. This stolen data reportedly included information like users’ email addresses, location, videos watched, keywords associated with the video, and the dates and times that they used the site.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Whatever you might think you’re going to get from the familiar setup of Jennette McCurdy’s Half His Age (a lonely high-school girl in Anchorage begins an extremely questionable sexual relationship with her teacher), any presumptions are dispelled from the very first page. When Waldo, the teenage narrator of the novel, observes her boyfriend’s “slimy tongue that loop-de-loops over and over like a carnival ride, mechanical and passionless,” she’s setting a tone: irreverent, graphic, bilious.

McCurdy is much more interested in late capitalism than in Lolita. Waldo’s world has long been poisoned by the microwavable meals her disinterested mother leaves out, the fast-fashion crop tops she orders that come with a cancer warning, the laptop she falls asleep clutching at 2 a.m., its unnatural heat “searing my ovaries.” By the time she meets Mr. Korgy, her frowsy middle-aged creative-writing instructor, on page 11, she is already imprinted on the reader as a caustic force of anti-nature.

And so she seduces Korgy—of course she does. Their relationship ensues through the slow erosion of boundaries, mostly instigated by her but sometimes by him. She masturbates using a bottle of tropical-fruit-flavored Tums while stalking his Instagram. He praises her writing and asks her to stay after class; he later invites her to dinner at his home with his wife. She sends him a thank-you email with her phone number. He calls her. And so on, until they’re frantically humping in a janitorial closet, in her childhood bedroom, at hotels (after fancy dinners where people assume he’s her father). Mr. Korgy—his first name is Theodore, but Waldo never uses it—is no scheming predator. His wife calls him “Teddy” and tells emasculating anecdotes about him. He’s soft and pitiable where Waldo is ferocious in her loneliness and adept at transforming herself into various alluring guises.

Literature is rife with memoirs and works of autofiction about ravening English teachers, accounts of mentors who allegedly groomed vulnerable girls with writing and manipulated their own words. Half His Age is resolutely not one of these books. But McCurdy, who, as a child, starred in Nickelodeon shows alongside Ariana Grande and Miranda Cosgrove, knows well all the ways underage girls can be flattened and plasticized by adults—turned into objects. Her previous book, I’m Glad My Mom Died, recounted McCurdy’s childhood being coerced into performing by her narcissistic and mentally unstable mother, who introduced her daughter to ritualized anorexia at the age of 11 and was such a hoarder, storing objects in every bedroom in the house, that her children had to sleep on Costco mats on the living-room floor. (McCurdy also wrote about a man she called The Creator, widely speculated to be the Nickelodeon executive Dan Schneider, who has faced multiple accusations of inappropriate conduct and abuse; Schneider has denied many of the allegations, but apologized for making people uncomfortable on set.)

Read: Don’t judge I’m Glad My Mom Died by its title

Half His Age, though, isn’t about abuse, or exploitation, or even the power dynamics of what we now call “age-gap relationships,” even as Waldo is bracingly aware of the occasions when Mr. Korgy manipulates her emotionally, and far too astute to fall for his “I want to expose you to art and films and music and books” schtick. The book reads much more like a postmodern novel for the fast-fashion generation, a portrait of civilizational decline told through declining mall chains, ultra-processed foods, and relentless consumption. Online shopping isn’t just a compulsion for Waldo—it’s an assertion of her existence.

Temporally, Half His Age is hard to place. Waldo refers to Instagram and TikTok but doesn’t scroll; she obsesses over her appearance, grooming herself with rigor and self-loathing, but doesn’t post pictures of herself or seem to have an online footprint beyond her shopping orders. She lives in Alaska, but all we hear about it is that her summer days are “bloated” and her winters bleak. Her local hangouts are wholly generic: Waldo works at Victoria’s Secret to fund her shopping habit, eats breakfast with her mom at Denny’s, and survives on Auntie Anne’s pretzels, Marie Callender’s entrees, and Sour Patch Kids. She rattles off cosmetic brand names the same way Mr. Korgy lists his favorite directors (“Bergman and Kubrick and Kurosawa, Lonergan and Linklater and Solondz”)—as a way of underscoring her identity, even if it’s homogenous. Brands are omnipresent in her life, as extant as air. (When the two have sex in Korgy’s car, the feeling of Cheerio crumbs being ground into Waldo’s knees becomes a staple part of the experience.)

McCurdy’s brittle commentary made me think of Don DeLillo’s description of the supermarket in White Noise, with all the hyperreal produce “sprayed, burnished, bright” and inserted into “filmy bags.” At some point in the 20th century, the critic Cynthia Deitering has written of that novel, humanity oversaw one of its most profound transformations: “a shift from a culture defined by its production to a culture defined by its waste.” In DeLillo’s imagination, the specter hovering over all of this unnatural abundance is death; in McCurdy’s, it’s desire. How is Waldo supposed to know what she really wants when her synapses are distorted by the dopamine thrill of acquisition, the heart-stopping kick of something new? She’s not exactly surrounded by appealing prospects. “You think some beefy senior’s gonna be emotionally available between his rounds of Grand Theft Auto and his daily hour of Pornhub?” she tells Mr. Korgy. What she’s most drawn to in her teacher is the way he seems to live outside her dull, trashy monoculture. But his Crate & Barrel throw pillows are no more authentic than her mom’s HOME SWEET HOME Target doormat, or the Le Labo candles and coffee-table books at Waldo’s rich friend Frannie’s house. When Korgy Amazon-ships Waldo a grocery order of some of his favorite nourishing foods, she can manage only three bites of the “chocolate paleo crunch granola with almond milk” before throwing it away.

In structural terms, Half His Age is much more thrilling in the first half than in the second, when Waldo’s frenzied fixation on Mr. Korgy curdles into a much more predictable entanglement. But McCurdy’s furious writing—her dystopian rendering of a culture squandering its dreams and desires on the crack high of cheap stuff—is hard to tear yourself away from. “Few adult persons can see nature,” another Waldo once wrote. Is that kind of transcendent communion with the real world even possible anymore? Half His Age might make you wonder.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">In 2006, I helped establish the NATO Special Operations Forces Command in Mons, Belgium. It included commandos from more than 19 nations. Over the course of the next two years, we trained and exercised together, drank together, and spent family time together. In doing so, we learned that our common values were much more important than our national differences. We also developed a bond that only men preparing for combat can appreciate.

By 2008, I was back fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan. In Iraq, I was blessed to have the British Special Air Service (SAS) and Special Boat Service (SBS) serving alongside my Rangers, SEALs, and Delta Force operators. The Brits took on one of the toughest missions in our counterterrorism fight: the suicide-bomber network operating in Baghdad. Their work unquestionably saved the lives of American soldiers and our allies. And they paid a high price for standing alongside us. In 2005, British special military units lost 10 personnel when one of their C-130s was shot down outside the city. We mourned their loss as if they were our own.

Isaac Stanley-Becker: The sacrifice of the Danes

In Afghanistan, NATO special-operations soldiers fought with tremendous courage and unwavering loyalty to their American counterparts. That commitment did not come without a cost, either. I stood on the tarmac in Bagram and Kandahar many times paying my final respects to soldiers from the U.K., Canada, Australia, France, Denmark, and Germany. Never have I seen such an outpouring of respect and admiration for their contribution to the fight. I also mourned the loss of the first Romanian soldier to have died in combat since World War II—just one of the 27 who fell in Afghanistan.

Many other nations contributed to the NATO mission and lost young men and women because we asked them for their help. We asked them for their help, and most didn’t hesitate. They understood the value of our alliance. They understood the power of being united in a common cause. They believed in NATO and they believed in the United States.

Anyone who would denigrate the service of our NATO allies clearly never spent a day in uniform. These NATO soldiers were as courageous, as heroic, as patriotic, and as loyal as any soldier I ever served with. I, for one, am forever grateful for their service and their sacrifice.

Winston Churchill once said that “there is only one thing worse than fighting with allies, and that is fighting without them.” If we continue to show disdain for our allies, if we fail to appreciate their contribution to our national security and greater global stability, we may find ourselves fighting alone someday. And trust me, war is never a contest you want to fight alone.</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Nearly as old as Ahab (one more birthday and I’ll be 58: his age), I drive south from Boston on a recent Saturday morning. Through a raging drabness of Massachusetts wintertime, I drive and drive: leaky light without a source; seething, decaying snow.

I’m on a mission here. A collision with immensity awaits: the 2026 Moby-Dick Marathon at the New Bedford Whaling Museum. Programming, scholarship, and—the event’s steadily droning core—a 25-hour cover-to-cover reading of the great book itself. Hundreds of volunteer readers, in five-minute increments, from noon on Saturday to 1 p.m. on Sunday. A test of my fortitude as a listener, of my ability to keep my behind in a seat.

But I am faint. Succor is required. I pull over at the Bridgewater Service Plaza because sometimes what you need is to quietly conform yourself to the will of God, and sometimes what you need is a cup of stinking black coffee and a Dunkin’ glazed doughnut.

Into snowy New Bedford, into the Whaling Museum, into the room where they keep the Lagoda, the museum’s half-scale model of a whaling bark. A room with a ship in it, in other words. Two stories high (to accommodate the ship’s masts) and stuffed, draped, festooned with humanity: sitters, knitters, nesters, kneelers, sprawlers, leaners, drifters like me, stashed in every alcove and stretched along every railing and baseboard. At noon on the nose, the Massachusetts poet laureate, Regie Gibson, steps up to the lectern: “Call me … Ishmael.” The whoop, the sound of exulting Moby-Dick nuts, goes raggedly around the galleries and hallways of the museum. The tale begins, of course, in New Bedford, where Ishmael arrives “on a Saturday night in December” in search of a whaling voyage. We have embarked.

Moby-Dick, by Herman Melville, published in 1851. Let’s consider it. Is there another book at once so good and so bad, so thrilling and so boring, so authentic to the currents of the soul and so hideously contrived, so stunningly patrolled by dreamlike visions and so crushed by its own intellectual baggage?

There’s no denying the power, the pull, of its mighty twin symbols: burning-eyed indeflectible Ahab, captain of the Pequod, emblem of every human obsession, of the violence of the mind; and his quarry, the white whale, the lump of metaphysical mystique known as Moby Dick. Psychic facts, both of them. But what a welter of chaos they must rise through to reach us—what sub–Thomas Carlyle thunderings, what sub–Sir Thomas Browne conceits and curlicues, what sub-Shakespearean rants. Shakespeare especially: a terrible influence on Melville! All the interior monologues in Moby-Dick, and almost anything that comes out of the mouth of Ahab—all those reams of hoarse Elizabethan bluster—you can blame on Melville’s 1849 devouring of a new seven-volume edition of Shakespeare’s plays, in large print (he had weak eyes). Enthusiastic American, as he began writing Moby-Dick, he was wildly cranked on the Bard. But wait, hist, soft, listen—now we’re on Chapter 7, and a reader speaks out a perfect line of Shakespearean blank verse: “Faith, like a jackal, feeds among the tombs.” Beautiful. I kiss my hand to you, Herman.

Melville would have enjoyed the New Bedford Whaling Museum. Like him, it is given to the grand gesture: whale skeletons suspended from the ceiling, floating above us like hierarchs at a superior level of being; the aforementioned room with a ship in it; and, right by the table where I buy my endless sustaining blueberry muffins and meat pies and cups of tea, a 600-pound life-size model in fiberglass of a blue whale’s heart, its ventricles large enough for a man to crawl into.

The readers: They are everyone. They have every quality. They are stammering, assured, dubious, virtuosic, inaudible, room-shaking, thick-voiced, thin-voiced, professional, innocent, mesmerizing, devoid of presence. It’s an American pageant, purely democratic, intensely moving. Reader by reader, the thread of meaning, the pulse, comes and goes. Some of them seem to seize us by the very roots of our comprehension; others might as well be reading from the Terms and Conditions of Use for Spotify. The prose of Moby-Dick is dense; it can be unwieldy—Melville’s mouthfuls are too large for our 21st-century mandibles. Some words that people have trouble with: idolator, remonstrances, vicissitudes, magnanimity, portentousness. Also (this one surprises me): leviathan.

With merciful swiftness, it is revealed that I cannot, simply cannot, listen to a succession of persons read from Moby-Dick for 25 hours. It’s an impossibility for me. I’m a modern man with all of the modern vices: inattention, solipsism, wooziness, dopamine addiction, twitching legs, low blood sugar, a persistent interest in going to the bathroom. So I phase in and out of the Marathon. I wander the museum; I wander the night streets of New Bedford, with their hostile glints of ice. At 7:02 p.m., I’m in the Pour Farm Tavern on Purchase Street, brooding over a double Jameson. Out of the jukebox, loaded with 1970s baggage but still moving, in 2026, with a slinking, predatory roll, comes Ted Nugent’s “Stranglehold.” The maniac Nugent, essential American, once a hard-rock warlock, now a vaunting Trumpist. Listen to the song: “Road I cruise is a bitch nowww, BAY-BEH! / You know you can’t turn me ’round / And if a house gets in my way, BAY-BEH! / You know I’ll burn it do-own.” Wow. How fucking Ahab is that?

Coming and going as I am, nevertheless, in my blue-whale heart, I remain attached to the collective, to the shared journey, the shared imagining, all of us with our copies of the book, all of us enmeshed in the great and groaning text. At 4:15 a.m. in the museum’s main auditorium, there’s a long-haul-flight vibe, people looking pale and rumpled as we steer toward Chapter 87, one of the most limpidly head-expanding chapters of the book: “The Grand Armada.”

Somewhere around Java, the Pequod hunts its way into an entire shoal of sperm whales: Its boats are lowered, and whereas at the edge of the shoal, the harpooneers set about their bloody and ocean-churning business, Ishmael’s boat finds itself in the supernaturally serene center. Peaceable whales approach; “like household dogs they came snuffling round us.” And in the transparent depths, a vision is disclosed: nursing mother whales.

As human infants while suckling will calmly and fixedly gaze away from the breast, as if leading two different lives at the time; and while yet drawing mortal nourishment, be still spiritually feasting upon some unearthly reminiscence;—even so did the young of these whales seem looking up towards us, but not at us, as if we were but a bit of Gulfweed in their new-born sight. Floating on their sides, the mothers also seemed quietly eyeing us.

Incredible prose, somewhere between journalism and science fiction. But a few paragraphs later, Melville falls into his old weakness, his old foible—he starts symbolizing. The violence at the rim of the shoal, the stillness at the center … He can’t help himself. He must go Sir Thomas Browne on our asses: “Even so, amid the tornadoed Atlantic of my being, do I myself still for ever centrally disport in mute calm; and while ponderous planets of unwaning woe revolve round me, deep down and deep inland there I still bathe me in eternal mildness of joy.”

Is it a weakness, though? Maybe not. Maybe this nonstop back-and-forth, this spiritual reverb, this throb-throb oscillation between the actual and the symbolic, the objective and the imagined, is the heartbeat of Moby-Dick. Are things ever only themselves, or do they always attach to, refer to, other realities? Must all phenomena have meanings upon meanings? Can a whale ever be just a whale? My mind loops out. It’s 5 a.m. What if existence itself (a line from my notes) is a pun on existence? That’s pretty bloody Melvillean, dude. The man sitting in front of me—rugged, with a fine Rockwell Kent profile—tips forward and begins to emit gentle, bleating snores.

With the dawn—streaky and watery over New Bedford—everything accelerates. Now we’re in the final stretch. Now we’re closing in. At 9:30, in the museum’s research library, a group of Melville scholars holds a packed and slightly giddy informal symposium. A young man, confiding to us that this is his first time reading the book, and apologizing for the basic-ness of his question, asks, “Is Melville using Ishmael to, like, satirize the whole white-male epic of obsession and violence?” Beat. Hanging symposial silence—until one of the scholars, as in the Philip Larkin poem, pronounces an enormous “Yes!” and the room erupts into applause.

The final readings are happening upstairs, in the Harbor View Gallery, with livestreams to all parts of the museum. I’m watching in the auditorium, the doors are open to the main hall, and there’s a slight lag in the streaming between the two spaces. So on every phrase you get an echo: “There she blows!” (There she blows …) Talk about Melvillean reverb. Another line of pure Shakespearean verse drifts up: “Great hearts sometimes condense to one deep pang.” (Deep pang …)

And who’s this guy reading the last chapter to us, Reader 277? He’s got to be an actor, a TV guy of some sort: He has an actor’s expressive and sympathetic handsomeness, soap-operatic facial symmetry, no bad angles. His name is Steven Weber (of Wings and Chicago Med, I later discover), he takes a deep breath, and then, my God, he tears the roof off the Moby-Dick Marathon. What a performance. The last battle with the white whale, the destruction (spoiler!) of the Pequod. Weber’s Ahab is all Ahab; his Starbuck is perfectly impassioned. “Moby Dick seeks thee not. It is thou, thou, that madly seekest him!” We are agog. Afterward, briefly interviewed by the museum’s president, Amanda McMullen, Weber is almost overcome. “I’m so moved by this,” he manages. “This book, boy …”

According to the reading’s organizers, more than 3,000 people attended this year’s Moby-Dick Marathon. Prediction: Next year, if the Whaling Museum can handle it, it’ll be 5,000. I don’t want to label this event a node of resistance, but … it kind of is. It’s a radical act. An all-analog mass redreaming of a book. And not just any book—a flawed American gospel. With Moby-Dick itself, I may have my little fancy-pants peeves, but let’s face it: Ahab is Donald Trump, and Ahab is me, and I am you, and Ted Nugent is the Pequod, and the whale is the whale, and the voyage is America. These resonances ring out; they ring out from New Bedford and keep going, traveling west until they roll down the hills of California and sink hissing into the sea.</div>

            <h2>Donald Trump Can Be Stopped</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-01-27</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/2026/01/trump-retreats-minneapolis-natcons/685776/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Of the many lessons to be drawn from the administration’s retreat in Minneapolis, the most important is that Donald Trump can be stopped.

He spent his first year acting as though the 2024 election were the last time he would ever have to give a thought to public opinion. Now the myth that Trump is invincible has been exploded.

After federal agents killed Alex Pretti, Trump-administration figures including Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem and Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller described the victim as a terrorist, indicating their desire to ignore or intimidate all opposition. But other Republican sources signaled their discomfort, and some called for an investigation—a routine step for a normal presidency, but a daring breach of partisan discipline in an administration that shields itself from accountability and tries to put itself above the law.

Robert F. Worth: Welcome to the American winter

During yesterday’s White House briefing, when a reporter asked if Trump shared Miller’s belief that Pretti was a domestic terrorist, Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt replied that she hadn’t heard him use that term. Trump also sent out conciliatory messages on social media indicating that he’d had productive talks with Minnesota Governor Tim Walz and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey. And he dispatched Tom Homan, the border czar and a more traditional immigration hawk, to replace Gregory Bovino, the commander at large in Minnesota. Bovino has justified his agents’ misconduct with transparent lies.

Trump’s retreat in Minneapolis is a stinging defeat for the national conservatives, the Republican Party’s most nakedly authoritarian faction. The NatCons believe American liberalism cannot be dealt with through normal political methods such as persuasion and compromise. Speakers at the National Conservatism Conference have described the American left as “the enemy within” (Senator Rick Scott of Florida) and “wokeism” as “a cancer that must be eradicated” (Rachel Bovard of the Conservative Partnership Institute). NatCons also maintain that immigration poses a mortal threat to the United States. These two strands of thought are intertwined; NatCons consider immigration a weapon employed consciously by the left to assume permanent power, via manipulating elections and creating government dependency, a conspiracy that can only be reversed through the kind of ferocious operation on display in Minneapolis.

The NatCons, whose ranks include powerful administration figures such as Vice President Vance and Miller as well as members of Congress (such as Senator Eric Schmitt of Missouri) and activists (such as Heritage Foundation President Kevin Roberts), have wielded profound influence. They have rarely, if ever, lost important struggles to steer Trump’s strategy.

For the NatCons, the mass-deportation scheme overseen by Miller is an existential priority. Vance once claimed that immigration levels “would mean we never win, meaning Republicans would never win a national election in this country ever again.” Ten days ago, Miller explained on Fox News that Democrats were resisting ICE in Minneapolis because “this mass-migration scheme is the heart of the Democratic Party’s political power.” Miller sees his crusade not merely as a matter of relieving the burden on public services or raising wages, but as a final chance to stop permanent left-wing tyranny. Thus Miller’s immediate, fervent insistence that Pretti and the other Minnesotan recently killed by federal agents, Renee Good, both deserved their fates, a line the NatCons repeated vociferously through Monday.

The NatCons have attained their sway by positioning themselves as the vanguard of Trumpism in its purist form. Other conservative factions, such as social conservatives, libertarians, and foreign-policy hawks, supported Trump reluctantly in 2016, and backed away after the January 6 attack on the Capitol, hoping Florida Governor Ron DeSantis or some other rival could displace him. The NatCons never flinched in the face of Trump’s failed autogolpe, or any other actions that made other Republicans nervous. They won the loyalty contest—which, in the second Trump administration, is the only currency of influence.

Calls for Trump to stand firmly behind Miller had a desperate yet vague tone. “Leftist protestors who shut down streets, destroy property, refuse lawful orders, and physically assault federal officers cannot be rewarded with veto power over public policy,” beseeched the Manhattan Institute activist Chris Rufo, employing the passive voice. In response to a liberal observing yesterday afternoon on X that Trump was backing down, Will Chamberlain, a national conservative affiliated with numerous right-wing organizations, replied, “This isn’t happening, and it’s very important that it does not happen.”

The reason it happened is that, although Trump listens to the NatCons, he has no deep grounding in their theories or, for that matter, any theories. The president’s despotism is not ideological but instinctive. He cannot tolerate criticism and he deems any process that embarrasses him, including a critical news story or an election, illegitimate, even criminal.

And while he has embraced a restrictionist immigration agenda, he has vacillated between endorsing mass deportation and allowing exceptions for categories of laborers he considers necessary. As Trump told The Wall Street Journal editorial page before the 2024 election, “I mean, there’s some human questions that get in the way of being perfect, and we have to have the heart, too.” If that has ever occurred to Miller, he has hidden it well.

Whether or not Trump’s intermittent expressions of human feeling for the immigrants his administration has abused is heartfelt, his desire to maintain his political standing most certainly is. Trump appreciates the power of imagery. It does not take a political genius to understand that, if Americans were repulsed by the sight of a Vietnamese man being executed in 1968, an American being shot in the back, facedown on a midwestern street, would not go over much better.

Trump’s capitulation would never have occurred if not for the heroic, disciplined resistance in Minneapolis. Faced with something like an occupying army that was systematically flouting the law, the people of Minneapolis thrust its abuse into the public eye, raising the political cost of Miller’s war until enough Republicans decided that they couldn’t bear to pay it.

Political theorists have long debated whether Trump and his movement should be described as fascist. On an intellectual level, the answer depends largely on which definition of fascism you choose (there are several). I have generally resisted the term because the definition I prefer, and the one most Americans probably think of when they hear the term, is not mere political oppression but a form of it so extreme that opposition becomes impossible.

That may be more or less Trump’s aspiration, and possibly our destiny. But this is not a fascist country, at least not yet.</div>

            <h2>Josh Shapiro Takes a Gamble on His Faith</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-01-27</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/books/2026/01/can-josh-shapiro-turn-his-jewishness-asset/685774/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Sometimes the country wants a man of faith. This happened when Jimmy Carter, a former Sunday-school teacher, was elected following Watergate, and when the born-again George W. Bush’s slim victory looked like a repudiation of Bill Clinton’s sex-scandal-marred presidency. To speak in the register of faith—not a particular sect or even God, but a grounding belief in a higher order—is to reach beyond partisanship, to try to return to basic moral precepts. In calmer times, a leader expounding from such heights risks sounding preachy and self-righteous. But when the country is exhausted, this might be just what people want.

Right now, the country is exhausted. And Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro, a top contender for president in 2028, has a new memoir in which the word faith appears nearly 100 times.

In Where We Keep the Light, Shapiro is doing what presumptive candidates for the highest office usually do when they write such a book: He is laminating his narrative. Here is the regular guy who loves shooting hoops, who is hopeless with a hammer, who loves a self-deprecating story about walking into a glass wall or almost falling off a ladder, and whose wife, Lori, is always, always right. He is, in short, pretty boring by almost any measure, and his book can lapse into the gobbledygook of clichés that fill such memoirs—Shapiro is able, for example, “to make a choice and then execute it” when “all eyes were watching.” What stands out, however, is the centrality of his religion—or rather, his faith—which is Judaism.

At the moment, Shapiro would seem to have every reason to downplay his Jewishness. When he was one of the two top contenders to be Kamala Harris’s running mate in 2024, this part of his identity was frequently touted as a liability. “He’s Jewish,” CNN’s John King pointed out, so “there could be some risk in putting him on the ticket.” Others put it less nicely. Certain camps on the far left of the Democratic Party branded him as “Genocide Josh” for his support of Israel after October 7—though his views were not much different from those of most of the Democratic establishment. Add to this the rise of an ambient anti-Semitism on both the right and the left, along with the unavoidable reality that Jews are a minuscule minority in this country; any candidate who keeps kosher must overcome a certain strangeness factor if he wants to pass that all-important test of being someone to have a beer with.

But rather than downplay his Jewishness in his memoir, Shapiro puts it at the center of the political identity he is prepping for the national stage. He does this, however, in a quirky—and perhaps savvy—way: Shapiro uses the flexibility of Jewish identity to speak about faith without really delving into the particularity of Judaism.

He can do this because Jewishness is not one thing. It can be a cultural identity—like the Seinfeld-and-bagels version. It can be an ethnic or even a national identity (otherwise known as Zionism). And it can be a religious identity, a set of rituals and practices either strictly adhered to or modified over time. For any individual Jew, the mix will vary wildly. The crux of Shapiro’s Jewishness, by his account, is the religion, but he writes that it is “less about the story and the text than about the lesson and the deed.” He does abide by many of those rituals and practices—such as keeping kosher and not missing Shabbat dinner with his family—but these aren’t the elements he emphasizes. The book is heavily weighted instead toward the thing he calls “faith,” with himself as its “steward.” To my ear at least, this sounds more like the way an evangelical Christian might speak of their religion, but for Shapiro, this word becomes a bridge between who he is and the people he is trying to reach.

Faith here means a kind of centeredness, an inner voice, a prayerfulness. He admits that this all might “sound a little vague”—it does—and he struggles to define exactly what faith means to him beyond the fact that it is the most important aspect of his identity and that it allows him to judge right from wrong, to separate the trivial from what actually matters. Defining his beliefs is “kind of like when you get asked to explain how you fall asleep or blink,” he writes. “You just know to do it.” But faith, for all its squishiness, is the force he deploys, again and again, as a way to connect with other Americans. It is, in other words, not just a central part of himself, but also what turns his Judaism from a potential liability into a potential asset.

After the governor’s mansion was firebombed last year, hours after the Shapiro family had held their Passover seder, an elderly fire-department chaplain named John Wardle handed Shapiro a handwritten prayer. Shapiro choked up immediately: These words of blessing and protection (from Numbers 6:24–26) were the same that he utters in Hebrew over his children every night. “Despite our differences, at our cores, our values are the same,” he concludes. “Our humanity is shared.” When he calls the family of the man who was killed in the assassination attempt on President Trump in Butler, Pennsylvania, he worries at first that fierce Trump supporters, even in grief, won’t want to speak with him. But then: “I told them about my faith and how much strength it has brought to me in my life,” Shapiro writes, “and that while we didn’t share the same faith, I knew theirs would bring them calm.”

Episodes like these coalesce into the central motif of his memoir: faith as an eraser of difference. Whom does he count as his closest adviser on keeping this faith? Well, Lori, of course. But after her, the person he turns to when he has a problem is a Black Baptist pastor named Marshall Mitchell. In an ecumenical text chain, they go “back and forth about a line from the Book of John or a passage from the Book of Joshua.”

The laws of Judaism are traditionally meant to create distance, to distinguish Jews from other people. This is what kashrut and Sabbath observance are about—avoiding certain food or workdays as a way of setting themselves apart. When Joe Lieberman was Al Gore’s vice-presidential candidate, he made a point of emphasizing this difference—everyone near him knew that he was strict about not doing business on Saturday and would bring his tuna sandwiches on the road to make it easier to keep kosher. This was part of the appeal of his candidacy, a return to traditionalism after the Clintonian chaos (Bush’s born-again Christianity promised the same). But Shapiro de-emphasizes the rules of Judaism. He has to, because it’s the only way faith can function for him in this story. “For me it is spirituality more than religiousness,” Shapiro writes.

Read: By the time political violence gets worse, it will be too late

As he elides the rules of Judaism to focus on the “soul work,” he also makes only passing references to October 7, and he manages to completely avoid mentioning Gaza—as in, not even once. Shapiro has been outspoken in his criticism of the Israeli government (Benjamin Netanyahu, he has said, is “one of the worst leaders of all time”). He has also called out some of the pro-Palestinian protests on campuses, believing they tipped over into being anti-Semitic. Shapiro is a liberal Zionist, which means he has a nuanced position on the conflict between Israelis and Palestinians at a moment when, on this topic, few people who care about the issue really want to hear nuance. But when Israel does appear in the book, he doesn’t lay any of this out. Instead, the Jewish homeland is just the place where he first connected with—yes—his faith. “In Israel, it was just everywhere,” he writes. “It was the first time I could feel faith. I could see it and touch it and it wasn’t abstract.”

There is something unique, perhaps even brave, about discussing Israel in this way, as a place perceived not just through a political lens but one that could have so much meaning to a Jewish teenager from suburban Philadelphia (he even proposed to Lori in Jerusalem). And yet the faction in the Democratic Party that called him “Genocide Josh” has not gone away, and neither has the unfair suspicion that he had to confront when he was vetted by Harris’s people and was asked, he writes in the book, whether he had ever been “an agent of the Israeli government.” These voices have only gotten louder, with large parts of the Democratic Party openly opposing the United States’ continued support of Israel. A Jewish candidate such as Shapiro might want to focus on faith, but he has to face up to the reality, fair or not, that he will be asked to explain Israel’s actions more than a Mormon or Catholic candidate would. By avoiding it completely in his campaign memoir, he only confirms just how much he does not want the subject to overtake his candidacy—and concedes, in a way, that it very well could.

What comes across loud and clear, though, is Shapiro’s bet that Americans want someone like him, who can talk earnestly about concepts such as good and evil, and what it means to have moral clarity. “Now, more than ever, we yearn for and need a world defined by faith,” he writes in the book’s closing lines. “It’s universal, this belief in others to help us through what feels unsettled, uncivil, un-American. It’s a guidepost, a path through the woods.”

At a time when citizens are on the streets in Minneapolis risking their lives in order to protect their neighbors, this sentiment feels like a resonant one. The motivation for confronting masked, armed agents with whistles and phones is not as much political as it is moral. These people are angry that something has gone awry in the way we treat one another, that we have lost a sense of the common good—an understanding of what is normal and what isn’t. This is the place where Shapiro is firmly planting himself, and whether you find his fulsome profession of faith to be authentic—I do—it might also be a pretty good strategy for winning.

            <h2>First Comes ICE, Then Come Lawsuits</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-01-27</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/2026/01/minnesota-legal-response/685768/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">American citizens have been brutalized, pepper-sprayed, and killed on the streets of Minneapolis. For many, one particular breakdown is a final, damning cause for despair: Minnesota’s apparent inability to investigate and potentially prosecute the federal agents responsible. The Department of Homeland Security on Saturday reportedly blocked Minnesota officials from examining the scene of Alex Pretti’s shooting. Access was refused even after state officials got a judicial search warrant. As a result, key forensic evidence was almost certainly lost. This comes after state officials were excluded from the investigation into Renee Good’s death.

Federal obstruction of Minnesota’s criminal investigation merits more creative pushback from the state: Leaving investigations in the hands of DHS alone sends a powerful message to ICE officers. It tells them that even if they effectively execute a U.S. citizen who presents no threat on camera on a public street, they will face no consequences—a recipe for future tragedies. The state’s interest in finding a way to at least create some deterrence to deadly federal lawlessness is not just a matter of justice: It is also a way of keeping its people safe moving forward.

Robert F. Worth: Welcome to the American winter

This is not a completely novel situation. Criminality is often shielded by large organizations, and clever lawyers have come up with clever strategies for dealing with it. For example, in the early 20th century, prosecutors resorted to pretextual indictments to go after the mob—the tax-evasion case against Al Capone being the most famous such prosecution. Because prosecutors could not scrape together evidence of his core crimes, Capone was convicted first of contempt of court and then of tax evasion.

Now, as then, when a direct path to justice is blocked, states need to find a work-around. The federal prosecution of the Minneapolis officers responsible for George Floyd’s death offers a model. For example, the officers Tou Thao, Thomas Lane, and Alexander Kueng were held criminally liable for acts beyond the killing. First, all of them failed to provide medical assistance to Floyd as he was dying. Second, Lane and Kueng made misleading omissions, while Kueng also lied to investigators in the immediate aftermath of Floyd’s death. Drilling down on these facts reveals specific paths forward for state prosecutors even when a direct investigation of the killings is blocked.

Evidence of both these two kinds of crimes has already emerged in the two recent ICE killings. After Good was shot, ICE agents blocked a physician from aiding her. Minnesota law not only imposes misdemeanor liability for failures to aid in general, but in shooting cases obligates the person who fired the wounding shot to “render immediate reasonable assistance.” When a shooting victim then dies, penalties in Minnesota for failing to aid the injured person can involve up to two years’ imprisonment.

In the Pretti case, the alleged obstruction of key evidence-gathering steps gives state prosecutors another potent opening, especially because ICE agents acted in overt defiance of a judicial warrant. Minnesota has a criminal obstruction-of-justice statute that applies to situations in which someone prevents a police officer or other agents from carrying out their official duties. You don’t get much more official than executing a judicial warrant. Concealing evidence after the fact is a separate offense that also fits what is publicly known about both the Good and Pretti cases. The resulting criminal penalties would attach to anyone who conspired in that concealment. This could reach more senior figures within the administration who acted to hinder justice by using lies and slander to deflect responsibility and—worse—to score political points from the deaths.

Minnesota, and other blue states, should also enact new laws that make federal obstruction harder. The Pretti case shows that ICE officials were willing to ignore a state-court warrant. Perhaps anticipating that, Minnesota officials went to federal court on Saturday, potentially after the scene of Pretti’s shooting had been compromised, and obtained a temporary restraining order about evidence preservation. The legal basis for such orders, however, may be fragile. Minnesota and other states would thus do well to shore up their capacity to get a rapid federal-court injunction against evidence tampering. For rather technical reasons, there is a very specific way to make sure this possibility is always available: Enact a law that allows a state’s attorney to seek damages of more than $75,000 against anyone who has violated the constitutional rights of a Minnesota citizen. Then allow the state’s attorney to file suit in federal court, and to expeditiously seek a bench warrant to preserve evidence. In practical effect, this would be a device to transform ICE’s obstruction into not just a violation of state law, but also of a federal-court order.

Criminal liability by its nature comes too late to stop harms from happening. States such as Minnesota should also look to civil law as a basis for stopping baleful and unlawful ICE tactics. This also requires some creative thinking—taking a legal tool designed for other purposes and fitting it to our new reality.

Many states have what’s called a public-nuisance law. This allows the state to go to court and get an injunction against the use of a property in ways that disrupt life for many around it, such as, for example, if a quarry produces noise and vibrations that make it hard for those in the neighborhood to sleep, or if the odors of a feedlot make using a particular street intolerable. States have reached beyond this sort of historical usage recently, employing public-nuisance laws creatively even when the problem is not tied to one specific piece of land. For instance, they have brought public-nuisance suits against opioid makers, gun sellers, companies responsible for lead contamination, and Confederate monuments. Public-nuisance law has proved a malleable stopgap when other kinds of regulation fail.

It’s not a big leap to see an application here. If fentanyl production or the existence of a Jefferson Davis statue can be legally deemed public nuisances, why can’t a deluge of violent, masked, and armed people flooding the streets of a city, maiming, brutalizing, and even killing along the way? This deluge is perhaps even closer to a classic public nuisance because it involves an activity that impedes the safe and orderly use of public streets.

Minnesota’s public-nuisance law has a useful wrinkle—one that other states worried about prospective ICE deployments would do well to imitate. It allows attorneys for the state to obtain injunctions against a “criminal gang.” A gang, in Minnesota law, is simply “any” group of people who repeatedly violate certain criminal laws. It doesn’t matter whether they work for the Latin Kings or Stephen Miller. What matters is that they create an ongoing risk of violent harm to the public.

A public-nuisance injunction could focus on specific people or tactics, or sweep more broadly. Such an injunction, moreover, would single out ICE officers’ unlawful, violent acts, as distinct from the lawful performance of official duties. Though certain immunities for federal officials are recognized, it is hard to see why they would apply to a public-nuisance injunction focused on lawless acts. That said, there’s no guarantee here: The Supreme Court under Chief Justice John Roberts has shown itself willing to create new and unprecedented legal immunities for federal misconduct without a scintilla of historical support. It could always do so here too.

To be clear, a public nuisance suit would face daunting odds. It might seem implausible on its face to say ICE is a “nuisance,” especially before one accounts for the Good and Pretti killings. But states need to reach for every possible tool to meet the moment. And the legal theory behind a public-nuisance ICE injunction stands on firmer ground than the Tenth Amendment suits filed in recent weeks by Minnesota and Illinois. Unlike these constitutional cases, a public-nuisance complaint flexes a well-recognized and historically based exercise of state sovereignty. True, its application is novel. But that simply tells us that we live in a moment of new political challenges.

Until now, states and cities have been in denial about those challenges. They have not grasped the profound and potentially irreversible rupture in federal-state relations that’s under way. They have moved slowly, encumbered by a belief that a reversion to the old ways of federal-state cooperation might still be possible. The killings of Renee Good and Alex Pretti—and the federal response to those killings—ought to put this lingering nostalgia to rest. A return to the days of state-federal cooperation will not happen unless the states reassert themselves to protect their citizens and punish federal lawlessness.</div>

You used to have various standard video conferencing software - eg microsoft netmeeting back in the days, which allowed direct communication between individuals without depending on a central service. Larger orgs could run a central service of their own if they wished, and external callers could connect in to it.

Now most users only have partial legacy connectivity encumbered by NAT and might not have IPv6 so this peer to peer approach no longer works, instead you get locked in to a centralised system. And s

Currently, France is #1 in terms of IPv6 adaption - close to 80%.  So they should be able to set up an IPv6-only conferencing solution similar to Teams, and they won&#39;t have to think about NAT at all.  Other Europeans who want to use that service can either go IPv6 themselves, or if they have to be IPv4, they can use NAT64 to connect

The people using what ever solution they use: are not necessarily in that country. Even if you count remote territories as &quot;in the country&quot;.

So IP4 versus IP6 is hardly an argument in either direction.

No idea where this IP4 versus IP6 numbers come from anyway: everybody here has IP6 *and* IP4.

The most backyard the country, the more modern is the internet infrastructure, and the more they have IP6.

This has nothing whatsoever to do with NAT. This is about getting off of American software platforms. NetMeeting, a Microsoft product, would also be on the chopping block.

Larger orgs could run a central service of their own if they wished, and external callers could connect in to it.Anyone, even private individuals can run a central server for countless chat and video apps, many of them open source and free.The data sovereignty thing is a Not Invented Here reaction that will only cost these countries a fortune before they are abandoned and everyone settles on Teams, Slack, Zoom, Meet, again.

It&#39;s no problem to use Rocket Chat or Jitsi for your chat and video calling.

The problem is the network effect. Where do all the participants live? The networking effect says that this plan fails because everybody lives on Teams, or Slack, and to a disturbingly growing level, Discord.

Naming video platform Visio was beyond stupid and almost certain to get them sued by Microsoft.

Maybe other people have different experiences but in my day to day I end up having to use all of those and then some because it&#39;s not always my own companies meetings I have to join.

My company uses Google Meet for 90% of calls but also use Zoom for larger calls then many of our clients use Teams so I&#39;ll have to connect to that.  Some use Zoom, some even still use WebEx so when needed I will use that.  Someone a couple months ago was still using GoToMeeting.

If you want passwords, there are plenty of lists available for free and for sale. There&#39;s no need to go to all this trouble.

I checked out RFC 2606  [rfc-editor.org], and there is nothing there about using IANA assigned IP addresses (in case of IPv6, it&#39;s 2001::/23).  It would seem to me that the most appropriate IP address to use for example.com would be 2001:db8:1:1::0af5, since one would be mapping example.com to an address from the reserved space for examples in IPv6

Sorry, I don&#39;t know if there is an equivalent block in IPv4 for documentation purposes like the 2001:db8::/32.  The only IANA assigned addresses have 0 in the first byte of an IP

It can&#39;t ever hit midnight, since that means the world has ended and the committee who sets the clock doesn&#39;t exist. But they don&#39;t want the clock to go away and lose their influence, so they have to conserve their remaining 85 second for as long as they want to exist.

Reminds me a bit of parents who count down trying to get their kids to do something. They get to one and since they don&#39;t have actual consequences they want to dole out they start counting fractions.

Besides, a Doomsday Clock is such a boomer way to predicting when World War 3 will start. All the cool kids are taking bets on Polymarket on when World War 3 is starting instead!

Right now, they&#39;re only predicting an 8% chance of a military conflict between the US and China this year. Those are good odds if you&#39;re someone who thinks that we&#39;re all getting nuked soon!

Interestingly, it is not only not reaching zero, but it is not only heading for an irrational asymptote, but it is already irrational.

Well, more like it loses credibility as a metaphor.  The &#39;best&#39; ever was 17 minutes to midnight and generally it&#39;s been less than 10 minutes to midnight all our lives.

As they respond to ever escalating concerns, the time increments necessarily get smaller, because they can&#39;t hit &#39;midnight&#39;.

It&#39;s like the trope of &quot;I&#39;m going to count to 3 and then you&#39;ll be in big trouble... 1... 2.... 2 and a half... 2 and three quarters... 2 and seven eighths.....&quot;  An outright declaration of will to launch nukes in the nex

I know it started as a doomsday nuclear war clock, but they really should set up time zones now. Maybe one for western Europe, one for Eastern Europe, one for Asia, one for Australia, one for the US & Canada, one for Central America, and one for South America. That would give them more opportunity to climb on their soapbox, and cause all sorts of hilarity as people argue over the merits of the various zones and their current time(s).

Think of the marketing slogans: What is your DoomZone?

And while it is true that the United States is no condition for sainthood, Russia and China have been highly aggressive for their own aims. Russia has a long history of cutting off parts of neighboring countries. They took part o

They list a lot of reasons why nuclear nations are at odds with each other, but then throw in:

Uh, yeah, that&#39;s certainly an interesting general military concern, but adding that note to this press release seems more designed to be trendy or pick up clicks. I don&#39;t think anyone&#39;s considering putting AI&#39;s finger on the nuclear button.

My itching balls are as much of an indicator of the future as the &quot;Doomsday Clock&quot;.

Like PETA...    This is about attention and clicks.  Otherwise, there would be an actual scientific peer-reviewed and reproducible algorithm to set the clock.

I stopped subscribing when they added non-nuclear threats to their &quot;Doomsday Clock.&quot;

I subscribed because I&#39;m interested in nuclear issues.  Since ten years ago, half the magazine is now about climate change, terrorism, war, unrest, immigration, etc.

Getting at home deliveries and expanding Whole Foods seems a lot more reasonable than trying to push the just walk out creepiness. No surprised that it wasn&#39;t a winning idea.

Also Amazon as a brand has a negative connotation to most people, but they win out over their competitors because of their shipping rates and speeds. But in the brick and mortar space that has other options that are as equally convenient and less creepy, not surprising that they aren&#39;t keeping up.

I have a monthly subscription and I have also found the fruits to often be sour, the vegetables frequently wilted, and some perishables to be expired or near expiration.

I wish you had said more in support of your Subject. As one word it might be vacuous, and you didn&#39;t really flesh out your intention in your post. Perhaps both &#39;problems&#39; due to the rush to FP?

Me? I actually prefer self-service. I&#39;m not trying to cheat the store and I&#39;m meticulous about getting it exactly right, but I like the lower pressure. I think it&#39;s mostly the lack of an imminent feeling of someone waiting because of me. I&#39;ve never visited an Amazon shop of any sort (and my second and final Amazon pur

Amazon Go&#39;s Just Walk Out combines cameras and RFID tags combined with a fleet of Indian contractors watching every movement in the store of every thing you pick up, look at, and put back is the creepy part combined with machine learning algorithms on your behavior.

This is in comparison to other retailers self service such as scan your own with a phone or self scan terminals. Self service can be convenient, undoubtedly. Having every moment ob

No one wanted to be intensely surveilled while shopping?   Never would have thought.   Sure, grocery stores today have tons of cameras (look up!) but typically they only use the footage when they need it as evidence to convict a shoplifter.

Too bad about the Amazon Fresh, I used it for years as a convenient Amazon returns drop off location.Of course never bought anything, as it was substantially overpriced with the same stock as the nearby Walmart (and the panopticon check out didn&#39;t instill confidence).

The e-commerce giant said Tuesday that some of its shuttered Amazon-branded brick-and-mortar stores would be converted into Whole Foods Market locations.You can return Amazon purchases to Whole Foods markets...

My favorite local Whole Foods closed their in-store bar and replaced it with a returns desk a few years ago.  So disappointing.

There is no need for those Orwellian nightmares to exist.

First Amazon crushes brick-and-mortar stores, then decides to get into the bricks-and-mortar store business?

Beyond convenient return locations, this never made sense, and now they&#39;ll convert many of the shuttered locations into Whole Foods stores that will make equally wonderful return depots for online purchases.

They could probably do okay with small corner stores/liquor stores, that also take returns.

TL:DR: the math shows they *can&#39;t* go beyond a certain complexity.

Yep. Obviously. They have that little problem that each step they take to get to something has a probability of failing, unlike actual deduction. That probability adds up and at some depth, it is all noise.

Good to see somebody took the time to look into things. From briefly skimming the paper, the upper bounds seem to not depend on the LLM, but solely on the complexity of the question asked. The limit they examine seems to be of the form that &quot;all queries above the complexity limit will end up in hallucination&quot;.

They are a &#39;magic&#39; mathematical box that will give you the most probable output based off of inputs that they have already seen. If they haven&#39;t seen something or something like it they aren&#39;t going to give you that output.

The real problem with the industry is they are working with a &#39;black box&#39; that gives you output&#39;s from inputs, but they don&#39;t really know what is going on inside. Yes they are finding out more and more, but if you don&#39;t know how an engine works you certainly aren&#39;t going to be able to des

I think the best outcome is to wait until the C-Suites are replaced by LLMs, they&#39;&#39;ll be dragged screaming and kicking to the door: &quot;B....B....But you need me!, who will bullshit the investors like we do.&quot; Whereupon, the Bullshit Bot will finally be revealed as a component of the LLM C-Executive Team.

Indeed. What is hilarious is that, apparently, many people are suffering from similar issues and cannot actually put the &quot;general&quot; in general intelligence in whatever thinking they are capable of. And hence the hype continues, despite very clear evidence that it cannot deliver.

As to &quot;AGI&quot;, that is a &quot;never&quot; for LLMs. The approach cannot do it. We still have no credible practical mathematical models how AGI could be done.

I would submit that automated theorem proving or automated deduction (basically the same

The point goes into the other direct: Are humans different?A human cannot decide on its next action on other grounds than input and what it has seen before either. People always imply there would be something magical about the brain, but in the end it is also just a very complex neural network learning from sensor inputs and controlling several I/O channels.

Obviously. Anything and any lie to keep the hype going.

The actual reality is that LLMs are not _capable_ of &quot;novel&quot; discoveries. All they can do, occasionally, is find something were everything is known, but there is a simplistic step missing to connect things. And that is it.

What this dishonest asshole implies is that this will change and LLMs may well get that capability. That will not happen. The Math used does not allow it.

He plays down the idea that LLMs are about to come up with a game-changing new discovery. “I don’t think models are there yet,” he says. “Maybe they’ll get there. I’m optimistic that they will.”

But, he insists, that’s not the mission: “Our mission is to accelerate science. And I don’t think the bar for the acceleration of science is, like, Einstein-level reimagining of an entire field.”Notice the important part before the sentence; he&#39;s talking about &quot;game-changing new discovery&quot; not regular nuts and bolts of scientific work.

Yes, you do misunderstand. There are two different theorems frequently referred to as Godel&#39;s theorems which are closely related, but in this case, the relevant one you are referring to is the statement that says roughly that any axiomatic system which is strong enough to model the natural numbers must have statements that cannot be proved or disproved within that system. This is a rough summary of a somewhat subtle result. Note that one needs to be really careful about what one means by axiomatic system o

The winds shifted this week after America watched Alex Pretti’s on-camera murder, on the heels of Renee Nicole Good’s on-camera murder, at the hands of Department of Homeland Security agents in Minnesota. Signs of cracks in the anti-immigrant right abound, from the alleged ouster of Greg Bovino from his role as “commander at large” of Customs and Border Protection to President Donald Trump’s TACO turn offering up an olive branch to Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz on Monday. Republican luminaries who are usually content to deflect, attack, or ritually fellate the president in the wake of acts of lawlessness and violence have taken to the airwaves to condemn these public executions, with protests about them coming from the likes of Republican Oklahoma Gov. Kevin Stitt, chair of the National Governors Association, and Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, as well as the Wall Street Journal’s editorial page, all of whom are demanding serious systemic changes in Trump’s immigration enforcement rampage. And gun rights groups have increasingly joined the chorus to contend that bringing a lawfully purchased gun out in public cannot be the basis for summary executions at the hands of federal officers. The CEOs of Target and other big corporations based in Minnesota seem to have unearthed something that looks to be a spine, calling for deescalation.

All credit—all of it—goes to the people on the ground in Minnesota; protesters, monitors, neighborhood patrols, independent journalists. As Robert F. Worth noted in the Atlantic, for all the MAGA talk of “domestic terrorists” and woke “assassins,” what’s emerged on the streets of Minneapolis is an organic, homegrown “meticulous urban choreography of civic protest,” a movement that is “leaderless” and “hyperlocal.” It has proven indomitable in the face of cosplay and photo ops and cartoon characters like Bovino and Kristi Noem. As Sherrilyn Ifill points out: “We all owe a debt of gratitude to the resilient and principled stance of the people of Minneapolis and the state of Minnesota who have remained undeterred. They have fought for their neighbors and for themselves. They have stood in proud defense of their city, and their right to peacefully protest. The organizers on the ground have been extraordinary.” Adam Serwer calls it simply “neighborism.”

It’s going to be tempting to say that this week in Minnesota is the beginning of the end of something, but more likely it’s the beginning of something worse. Bovino and Noem in retreat is not the same as Trump and Stephen Miller in retreat, and there is genuine reason to fear that this moment of so-called symbolic compliance—a fleeting, symbolic retreat to stymy growing public resistance—will slow the roll of congressional inquiries, impeachment efforts directed at Noem, general strikes, and calls to defund ICE. Moreover, as Attorney General Pam Bondi’s not-so-subtle effort to extort voter information from Minnesota’s governor reveals, this cruel deportation dragnet is only half of the story; as ever, effort to undermine future elections is the goal. For every strategic Trump flinch and retreat, you can expect an equal and opposite effort to remain in power forever. With every threat of impeachment and accountability, the incentive to ensure a permanent MAGA majority forever ticks up, invisibly, but assuredly.

Which is why it is a mistake to think of these twin tragedies in Minneapolis as the horrific government actions that finally prompted shifts in politics, or law. Too much attention is always directed at opinion polling, craven political actors, and the levers of political change, and doubly so during this second Trump administration. This tendency to witness everything through the lens of “when will this be over for good” distracts from the real meaning of Renee Good and Alex Pretti, which is not how they died, but what they were doing when they were killed. This is what changed on the ground in Minnesota, and what needs to happen in Philadelphia and in Maine and in whatever blue city or state becomes the next target and the target after that. This transcends even the conversations about flipping the House in November. This is about what we are now learning, under immense pressure, and in real time, about authoritarian takeovers and how to resist.

For years we were told that voters didn’t care about protecting the Constitution or democracy, and they certainly didn’t vote on it. And certainly that appeared to be true in 2016 and again in 2024. But what we have seen spring up on the streets of Los Angeles and Portland and Minneapolis, and what we saw in the earliest No Kings marches, is that Americans actually care deeply about the law and the Constitution and democracy, and also—to borrow from testimony from Jack Smith last week—that those things have functioned so well in the United States and for so very long that many of us had come to take it for granted. For the last 15 years at least, after Citizens United, and Shelby County, and Dobbs, when audiences at speeches would ask me “What should I be doing?,” my responses tended to be carefully lawyerly and bloodless: court reform, gerrymandering reform, campaign finance reform. Repair and protect democracy and we could perhaps claw back its original sins as well as its distortions and degradations.

Well, it turns out it’s actually much more basic than that. What we are seeing amid the street protests, and the meal deliveries, and the marches and the legal observers and the calls for a general strike and for defunding DHS and impeachment for criminals, is actually all democracy work, and constitutional work, transmogrified and embodied into American streets and schools and small businesses. I was struck and moved by Robert Worth’s observation about what he witnessed in Minnesota: “Again and again, I heard people say they were not protesters but protectors—of their communities, of their values, of the Constitution.” And if this is, in fact, the call, then what it might look like to answer it is no longer inchoate or mysterious. People are fighting and being assaulted and even murdered on their streets for the First Amendment, the Second Amendment, the 14th Amendment … This is a clawing back of the Constitution, amendment by amendment, on the streets, and by the people.

Those of us who believed ourselves to be part of the Trump Resistance in 2016 made the mistake of naming it without quite knowing what it was. Pink hats and marches that felt like street fairs and witty signs were for social media. This version of the resistance swallows that whole—law enforcement officials want to shoot you, and you will be pepper-sprayed while you are restrained on the ground. As DHS efforts to occupy and terrorize cities morph and expand, this won’t be “protest” as we once understood it; it will be something far more frightening, something familiar to historians of racialized policing. Yes, it requires, even demands, new rules of engagement. Legal and civil disobedience training are now essential, and there will be ample work to do in protecting vulnerable neighbors and neighborhoods. It turns out that it was only hard to articulate what needed to be done to protect democracy and the Constitution until it needed doing. And now that we know what democracy emphatically does not look like—tyrannical cruelty as part of an all-out demand for mass submission to authority and the subordination of the “other”—it has, overnight, become simpler to name and understand the mission.

This is why the most dangerous days are almost certainly ahead, but it helps to know that the courts, and most of the lawyers, and the blue-city mayors and the blue-state attorneys general and the neighbors and the teachers and the religious leaders, already know in their bones which side they are on. Democracy will not defend itself, in much the same way that authoritarianism will not just pick up its nasty toys of wars and go home. There is a massive shift taking place that has to do with resisting state executions of lawful protesters but also has as much to do with fighting for the core values laid out by the same imperfect streetfighters who founded the country. It is indeed the stuff of nightmares, but this is what democracy must look like.

Now we can name the mission, which is no small thing. Focus on the mission and ignore spectacle and spin. Of the many, many things that Trump and MAGA have misunderstood, almost foremost among them was the belief that Americans would forever be more interested in consuming white-supremacist online content than in creating actual democratic freedom. From Chicago to Portland to Minneapolis to your town, when someone asks you what they should be doing, the answer must be: Protecting the Constitution.

Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Customs and Border Protection agents have now killed two U.S. citizens in Minnesota under the made-up banner of “absolute immunity” for federal law enforcement officials, regardless of what they do or how they do it. The notion of immunity for state actors in American law goes back decades, and much of what we are seeing on the ground now in terms of violent immigration enforcement has its antecedents in long-standing and deeply flawed American ideas about good guys versus bad guys and who bears the burden of law enforcement run amok. On this week’s Amicus podcast, as the nation struggles to process the executions of Renee Good and Alex Pretti, Dahlia Lithwick was joined by Alex Reinert, the Max Freund Professor of Litigation and Advocacy at Cardozo School of Law. Their conversation has been edited and condensed for clarity.

Dahlia Lithwick: ICE agents, like all federal agents, are protected by qualified immunity, and that protects them from lawsuits for constitutional violations committed in the course of duty. And we’ve had that for a long time. Help us understand this foundational idea that for the most part, law enforcement officers cannot be held liable for their actions when they violate your rights. How did we get here?

Alex Reinert: Really, there are two foundational ideas in play in these cases involving federal officials. One is what I’m about to talk about, which is qualified immunity, and a second is something called Bivens doctrine, which is a common law doctrine that used to allow people to sue federal officials for constitutional violations. Let’s start with qualified immunity, which is not long-standing in the sense that it’s really a modern introduction to the law of constitutional torts. It was introduced by the Supreme Court in 1967 in the context of a Freedom Riders case. That was the context in which a lawsuit was brought against state and local officials, and the Supreme Court basically said: We think, even though Congress didn’t spell it out in detail in a statute that gave you the right to sue these officials, and even though Congress didn’t say anything about an immunity doctrine, we think this common law doctrine that may have existed in 1871 should be incorporated into our constitutional tort regime. Fast-forward to 1982, which is where we got a case called Harlow v. Fitzgerald. In that case the Supreme Court said: We also think there should be an immunity doctrine that applies to federal officials.

What it means in practice is that any officer—whether state, local, or federal—who violates the Constitution won’t be held liable unless there is some prior case that makes it clear, from a court’s perspective, that the officer’s conduct was obviously a violation of the Constitution.

So qualified immunity is only really used, or it really only has an impact, when an officer is violating the Constitution. If officers don’t violate the Constitution, they don’t need the protection of qualified immunity. It’s only when officers violate the Constitution that they are able to obtain the protection of qualified immunity.

On its face, if you explained it to somebody and said that we should only hold officers liable when they were on reasonable notice of the unlawfulness of their conduct, people might look at it and think that makes sense. In practice, it has been applied in the widest range of circumstances where most people would say: How is it possible? How is it possible that somebody could get immunity when, for instance, they’re ordered by their supervisor not to fire a shot and they fire six shots and kill someone? When they are executing a search warrant and they decide to steal about $200,000 worth of valuables and a court says, Well, there’s qualified immunity because there wasn’t a prior case in point saying that when you’re executing a search warrant, you can’t steal money? Those are the kinds of cases in which qualified immunity comes into play.

It’s probably shocking to the ordinary person that in this country, a country purported to be governed by the rule of law, and where the Constitution is thought of as foundational, it turns out that violations of the Constitution by our highest-level officers and officials aren’t remediable because of this doctrine of qualified immunity.

Explain Bivens doctrine now, to set the table for what follows.

This is the other part of what is a perverse design of our constitutional scheme. Bivens is special because it applies only to federal officials. When state and local officials violate our rights, there’s a statute that goes all the way back to Reconstruction enacted in 1871 that allows us to sue state and local officials for violations of our constitutional rights. Qualified immunity still applies, but at least there’s a right to sue. There is no similar statute when federal officials violate the Constitution.

In 1971, in a case by the name of Bivens, the Supreme Court said: We think that we are going to find a right to sue in the Fourth Amendment, for Fourth Amendment violations when federal officials violate someone’s rights. Over the course of the next 10 years, the Supreme Court expanded that doctrine to include Eighth Amendment violations, and claims for sex discrimination. During the 1970s, lower courts were also rapidly expanding the Bivens doctrine.

All that changed in 1980. From 1980 on, the Supreme Court said: We are not going to entertain Bivens actions. And the court has given us a variety of reasons to the point where today, when the Supreme Court hears a Bivens claim, it basically says: We’re not sure that this court would even recognize the right to sue federal officials for constitutional violations. We’re certainly not going to extend that right to sue beyond the narrow category of the three cases in which the Bivens right was recognized in the 1970s. Furthermore, we’re going to confine those categories very narrowly.

I come back to this principle that we have a Constitution that is supposed to be meaningful in this country and it’s supposed to govern the conduct of all of our officers. It’s perverse that we have a federal Constitution that means less for federal officials than it does for state and local officials. We have a federal Constitution that is harder to enforce against federal officials than almost anyone else. That’s really a product of the Bivens doctrine.

And the last piece of this that I think is really important, just historically, for people to understand is that this wasn’t the model of remediation we had in the 19th century. You could sue federal officers in the 19th century when they violated your rights. It was not a unique occurrence. It was accepted that this was a way for people to obtain remedies. It also was accepted that it was a way to test the legality of executive conduct, of the policies and conduct of federal officials. Now we live in this world in which there are so many barriers to that kind of accountability, to those tests for legality.

That’s just a bad way to design courts. We want to learn from our mistakes. We want law to be able to develop if it should. It’s also bad, obviously, for people who are bringing these kinds of claims. I also think  it’s bad for policing. We want police to do their job consistent with the Constitution. Having answers to the question of when they violate rights and when they don’t should be, and is, important to them. So we’re losing all these opportunities in these cases to develop the law in ways that I think should help everyone.

Last week the AP reported a whistleblower complaint that showed that in violation of long-standing Fourth Amendment principles, ICE is taking the position that they can just enter folks’ homes without a judicial warrant. They can just use an administrative warrant. The whistleblower complaint alleges that the secret memo outlining this policy, signed by acting deputy ICE Director Todd Lyons, says, “although the U.S. Department of Homeland Security has not historically relied on administrative warrants alone to arrest aliens subject to final orders of removal in their place of residence, the DHS Office of General Counsel has recently determined that the U.S. Constitution, the INA, and the immigration regulations do not prohibit relying on administrative warrants for this purpose.”

I think it is extremely concerning and also an untenable interpretation of the Fourth Amendment. The Supreme Court hasn’t addressed this question, but the whole premise of the warrant requirement is that there should be some independent adjudicator—someone outside the executive branch—to decide whether or not there is a justification for invading the sanctity of someone’s home. Administrative warrants don’t provide that; judicial warrants do. That doesn’t mean judicial warrants are perfect, but they are at least outside the executive branch. It’s important from a separation-of-powers perspective, of course, and it’s important from an institutional design perspective. We already have so much about the immigration system over which the executive has so much authority: the appointment of immigration judges, all of these policy memos. So to fold the power to issue warrants, and act on warrants, into the executive in this way is just an extreme power grab. And the line about use of force gets us back to what we were talking about with Bivens and qualified immunity, which is when the officers use force in those circumstances, when they go overboard in their use of force—as inevitably some will—what kinds of remedies will there be? Those will be few and far between.

It reminds me of Justice Kavanaugh’s concurrence in Noem v. Vasquez-Perdomo, where he says, essentially, People are talking about use of force, but this case isn’t about use of force. If there is a use of force, then people should be able to go to court and sue. He says all that in his concurrence, but at the same time we know that Justice Kavanaugh is one of the justices who has led the charge for undermining the Bivens remedy. It’s exactly what the Supreme Court does in so many contexts in the civil rights world. They’ll say: We’re not going to give you this remedy here, but don’t worry. There’s all these other ways you can enforce your rights. And then when they’re over there in the other box, they say: Well, we’re not going to allow you to enforce your rights here because there’s something else over here. Pam Karlan calls it a shell game and it works like this: When I’m over here, I’m going to say, Don’t worry about me limiting your rights because there’s some other way for you to enforce them. And then I’m just going to undermine your means of enforcing them in that other part of the jurisprudence. So it is troubling to the extreme that ICE officers are going to be acting on this authority.

Since 2020, and the murder of George Floyd and the flash of recognition that police reform was past due, there has been a significant public silence. As a consequence, in that silence, we have to grapple with that which makes us very uncomfortable. By “we” I mean a culture that has turned a blind eye to a lot of these issues and is suddenly startled by the ways police immunity and impunity have been weaponized for immigration enforcement. So help us think through reform in ways that are conducive to meaningful accountability and conducive to having a civic life that doesn’t include masked officers pepper-spraying or shooting somebody who’s already restrained on the ground. How do we think in a bigger, more generous way about getting to where we want to be?

I guess I would think about it in at least two different ways. The first is part of the reason there’s resistance to increasing accountability, particularly for our policing apparatus. It has to do with the sense that it’s a hard job. And it’s a job that at some level, most people think we need people to do. And what do we do when something that people see as really important, that’s also hard, what do we do when that imposes costs? When that imposes costs on people who did nothing wrong, who are left traumatized, maybe dead, seriously injured? I’ve always thought that the problem with a lot of the doctrine we’ve been talking about is it leaves those costs on the people who suffered them. It leaves those costs directly on the people who suffered them. But if we allow it, if we think there’s something good that comes out of policing, if we think it creates some value for the public at large, why should the costs be borne solely by the people who suffered most significantly as a result of it? So that’s one piece of it that always resonates with me about why some of the doctrine we’ve been talking about is so wrong.

For a while, or at least for I don’t know how long of a moment after the murder of George Floyd, there was a conversation. I would go to demonstrations and I’d see signs that said “End qualified immunity.” There was a way in which the doctrine that previously mostly lawyers knew about or scholars were talking about and mostly other people didn’t know about, that doctrine came into the public consciousness and became important. I think there is still some of that going on. I think there is still some momentum for that.

When we think about accountability, we usually think about accountability for an individual, an individual who behaved in some unlawful way. It makes sense to think about accountability that way. But the problems we’re talking about are systemic. That doesn’t mean there aren’t some individuals, the so-called bad apples, who no matter what kind of training we have, no matter what way we approach hiring, no matter what kind of supervision we provide, there are some people who may just act egregiously because they can, because they have a badge. But I think for the most part, the problems we’re talking about are systemic. And if the problems are systemic, then talking about accountability for individuals isn’t necessarily the right frame. I think we need to approach solutions to the problem systemically. And those solutions are as much about: Who ends up paying the damages for the people who suffer? Should it be the individual officer or should it be the departments that employ them? As a matter of practice, it’s always the departments who employ them. So we need to find a way for those agencies to learn better from the kinds of misconduct that their officers enter into. But it’s also about the legal regime that we set up to allow people to sue and what kinds of things they sue for, the way we allow people, really limit the ability of people, to bring so-called injunctive relief and systemic reform of departments.

So if we think about accountability more broadly, and we think about the problems we’ve been talking about, through a systemic lens, it’s not so much about the individual officer. It’s about creating a legal regime that allows us to get answers to the questions of how people were mistreated, whether the way in which they were mistreated was unlawful, and making sure that we can build systems so that it doesn’t keep happening. Because right now we’re in a world where it is happening over and over again and it seems like there are very few tools in our toolbox to prevent the reoccurrence.

Early Saturday morning, it appeared as if enough Senate Democrats were willing to fund the Department of Homeland Security and its deportation machine, if that’s what it took to keep the rest of the government open.

The House had passed funding for the DHS late last week, with seven centrist Democrats joining nearly all Republicans to get it over the line. The Senate was to take it up this week alongside a handful of other funding bills. It was expected that, as with the House vote, enough Democrats would hold their noses and support it, even if it meant absorbing blowback from a furious Democratic base that has been dusting off the largely dormant “Abolish ICE” slogan. Democratic negotiators felt that approving full-year, carefully negotiated spending bills and reasserting Congress’ power of the purse over a freewheeling executive branch was the priority of the moment.

“There is much more we must do to rein in DHS, which I will continue to press for,” Sen. Patty Murray, the top Democrat on the Senate Appropriations Committee, said in a statement last Tuesday, once the deal was released. She listed some pittances she had secured in the DHS bill, such as more money for body cameras for Immigrations and Customs Enforcement. She knew, though, that wouldn’t ease any anger within the base. Ultimately, she leveled.

“But the hard truth,” she added, “is that Democrats must win political power to enact the kind of accountability we need.”

All of this changed on Saturday in Minneapolis, when Border Patrol agents killed 37-year-old observer Alex Pretti. All of this changed when videos showed Pretti subdued, being pepper-sprayed and then shot, over and over again, without brandishing the firearm that he was permitted to carry. All of this changed when, as after the killing of Renee Good, White House adviser Stephen Miller and DHS Secretary Kristi Noem absurdly described Pretti as a “domestic terrorist” or “assassin.” After Pretti’s killing and the administration’s eyesight-defying remorselessness over what happened, there was no way Senate Democrats could put their fingerprints on a bill to fund the administration’s deportation machine.

“I will NOT support the DHS bill as it stands,” Patty Murray said Saturday.

She was hardly the only one. Democrats who’ve previously broken from the pack to join Republicans in advancing government funding bills, like Sens. Tim Kaine, Catherine Cortez Masto, Angus King, and Jacky Rosen, all said the same. On the House side, meanwhile, one Democrat who had voted for the DHS funding bill, New York Rep. Tom Suozzi, offered a mea culpa on social media, saying that he had “long been critical of ICE’s unlawful behavior and I must do a better job demonstrating that.”

Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer put a bow on Democrats’ new posture Saturday night: Democrats would filibuster DHS funding without changes. And it didn’t sound like there was much handwringing about it.

Does this make a partial government shutdown, after funding lapses after Jan. 30, inevitable? Let’s say much more likely. The situation is complicated for reasons including, but not limited to, the weather.

The funding bill the Senate will be voting on does not just cover DHS. It combines half a dozen bills that the House has passed in January funding everything from the Pentagon to the State Department to the departments of Health and Human Services, Transportation, Education, Labor, and more. Although this package includes only half of the 12 yearly appropriations bills, the specific departments it includes—especially Defense and HHS—comprise a comfortable majority of annual spending.

Senate Democrats are calling on their Republican counterparts, in Schumer’s words, to “work with Democrats to advance the other five funding bills while we work to rewrite the DHS bill.” In other words, to strip DHS funding from the package, pass everything else, and then allow for more time to negotiate the DHS budget.

Would Republicans be willing to do this? They typically don’t take orders from Democrats. But Republican leaders, just as much as Democratic ones, don’t want appropriators’ delicate work on the biggest funding bills to get sent to an incinerator of fury. The New York Times reported Saturday that “recognizing the depth of Democratic rage,” Senate Republicans “immediately began examining whether they could separate the homeland security funding from the rest of the package and preserve the bulk of what had been a bipartisan deal to fund a large chunk of the government.” Maine Sen. Susan Collins, the chair of the Appropriations Committee, said her committee was “exploring all options.”

If—if—leaders in the Senate reach an agreement to amend the package, then there’s another problem: The House is on recess this week, and House Republicans’ leaders wouldn’t be particularly enthused about summoning members to Washington to revote on a package amended at Democrats’ request. Plus, a substantial portion of the continental United States is buried under a sheet of ice and snow, conditions that aren’t conducive to travel.

It’s important to note that a lapse in DHS funding wouldn’t impede deportation operations much. As Patty Murray repeatedly said when she was trying to push the deal through, ICE is sitting on substantial funds that were made available to it in Republicans’ party-line megabill last year.

Murray is still saying that, posting on Sunday that “Americans must be eyes wide open that blocking the DHS funding bill will not shut down ICE. ICE is now sitting on a massive slush fund it can tap, whether or not we pass a funding bill.”

“But,” she added, “we all saw another American shot and killed in broad daylight.” They’re not about to bless it with their votes.

On Saturday, Alex Pretti was pushed to the ground and fatally shot by federal agents. Video shows that, moments before, Pretti was holding a cellphone in one hand and had his other hand up. Pretti was 37 and worked as an ICU nurse at a VA hospital. He enjoyed biking and had a dog named Joule.

Later that day, What Next’s Mary Harris spoke to Dimitri Drekonja, a colleague and friend of Pretti’s, who remembers him as “a kind guy” who modeled cooperation and who, right out of school, took one of the hardest jobs available to nurses. Their conversation has been edited and condensed for clarity.

Mary Harris: How did you learn about what happened?

Dimitri Drekonja: We were at [my son’s ski] race in the morning, and one of the other parents said, “Did you hear there was another shooting?” It sort of filtered through: “It sounds like another shooting.” “Another person died.” And there was a lot of sort of like, “This is just heavy.” “Awful.”

And then we got back from the race, and on a group chat, someone said, “ICE executed Alex Pretti.” [Editor’s note: It later became clear that the officers were with Customs and Border Protection.] It was from our group that we had had when we had first hired him to be study staff on our research project. It was like, What? You have to be kidding me.

I had seen one of the videos. [In it,] you can’t see the defined definitions of someone’s face and recognize them. But once the name was out there and I saw the build, the facial hair, it’s like, Oh, shit, that was Alex.

People have asked, “Are you surprised that he was protesting?” And, in all honesty, no one can be surprised that anyone in Minneapolis is protesting. We see 80-year-olds out protesting. We see kids out protesting. The city is pretty, pretty pissed off about what is happening, and people are out there doing their civic duty of being out there peacefully protesting.

Have you been able to watch the videos? I can’t stop myself watching the videos.

I don’t know how you watch someone you know—

I have not sought them out. I mean, my wife has shown me some, like, “Oh, God, with this new view you can see …” I’ve seen a few that way. It’s awful.

You posted on social media that you were feeling white-hot rage. What do you do with that feeling in this moment?

Right now, delay going to dinner with friends because I don’t feel terribly sociable. I’ve been really appreciative of people who have been reaching out to say, “Hey, sorry to hear—sounds like Alex was a great guy. This is hard.”

I think other people are enraged. I think the worst thing right now would be to have random violence. I’ve been really proud of Minneapolis—the scope and scale of the protests, the fact that they have been peaceful.

The administration has said your friend must have been trying to kill officers. Is there something you want to tell people who may have that belief about Alex?

The thing that I would say is that I have known Alex for years. I’ve known him to be a kind guy, a guy quick with a laugh, a joke, willing to help. He has never shared a conspiracy theory or shared anger at a group or been unpatriotic. I mean, he is the kind of guy that you would want as your neighbor and your friend. I would be thrilled if he were to move into the house next door.

We have a shared interest in mountain biking. We were planning on going out together. I was always the one who was having to say, “No, sorry, my kid has a race this week. Can’t do it.” But we liked the same trail systems, and we talked about riding them.

I have observed him clinically. He is fabulous, he gives great assessments, he’s enthusiastic, he is smart, and I will just say that anybody going into the ICU fresh out of nursing school—you’re gonna deal with very sick patients. A [large] percent of the patients in the ICU will die, and you’ll have to deal with grieving, upset families. You’ll have to use all your skills to try to keep that person alive. To do that right out of nursing school is impressive.

Sometimes medicine is a hierarchical place. He was not like that, and I loved that. I would run into him, and he would say, “Hey, Dimitri, how’s it going? It’s good to see you again.” I love that he had that informal relationship. I love it was modeled for trainees who worked with us. Like, yeah, this is how you do it: You’re colleagues, you’re friendly, you are nice to each other, and you work well together.

            <h2>Penguin in your pocket: Nexphone dual boots into Linux, Windows 11</h2>
            <p><strong>The Register | 2026-01-27</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2026/01/27/nex_brax_dualboot_fondleslabs/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">For most mobile devices, the OS is either Android or iOS, but a pair of new systems promises a host of additional OS options you can dual boot into. The Android phone can run Linux and boot into Windows 11 where it functions as a PC while the tablet runs a smorgasbord of Google-free OSes.

Nex comes first, if only by age. It&#39;s launching the NexPhone. This is a decently specced Android phone, but with one unusual feature and one that we&#39;ve not heard about before. The first is that, along with a clean copy of Android 16 with its own desktop mode, it will also include a bundled Debian Linux VM for running hardware-accelerated desktop Linux apps.

In addition, for a denser desktop experience, the device dual-boots with a copy of Windows 11 for Arm64, meaning that you can reboot into Windows; attach a screen, keyboard, and mouse with the bundled USB-C hub; and have a pocketable desktop computer.

The company behind the device, Nex, has been around for a decade: The Register covered the launch of the NexDock 2 in 2019 and a year later got its talons on one. A later version, the NexDock 360, is sold alongside Puri.sm&#39;s Librem 5 Linux phone. Founder and CEO Emre Kosmaz has a blog post explaining the history and inspiration behind the device.

Nex plans to start shipping the NexPhone in the third quarter of 2026. For now, Nex is asking for a $199 downpayment to reserve a phone, with another $350 to pay when the devices start shipping.

Brax Technologies is a newer company, started by prolific – and sometimes controversial – Youtuber Robert Braxman. Following the Brax2 phone in 2022, last year Brax successfully crowdfunded a $300 Google-free Android phone, the Brax3, on Indiegogo. It runs French de-Googled Android variant iodéOS, raised over $1M in backing, and started shipping in May 2025.

This year, Brax is following this up with an unusually expandable tablet called open_slate. Like the Nex phone, the open_slate will offer the ability to dual-boot: in this case, between a choice of de-Googled Android variants and several Linux distributions. On its forums, Brax has an open_slate &quot;megathread&quot; with more detailed specifications. For operating systems, it says:

Android-based systems (BraxOS, iodeOS, LineageOS, AOSP and others)

Native Linux distributions (e.g. Ubuntu Touch, Ubuntu, Debian, Yocto Linux and others)

So far, we must admit that these do actually look pretty decent and provide a number of the things that the Reg FOSS desk has long wanted in a tablet computer.

There will be two versions: one with 8 GB of RAM and 128 GB of flash, and one with 16 GB of memory and 256 GB of storage. It will also have a user-replaceable battery and a microSD slot for up to 1 TB of additional storage. All good stuff, if maybe not quite industry-redefining – but there is more promised.

As well as the microSD slot, the tablet will also have an M.2 slot for an NVMe SSD. That&#39;s different, and should be both much faster and more capacious than SDXC – and especially handy with a more mainstream Linux distro.

It is also promised to have two USB-C ports and a USB 2 type-A port as well. That would be very handy: this vulture has a Planet Computers Gemini, and its double USB-ports were one of reasons we backed its Kickstarter.

The specifications start to go overboard for us, though, when it comes to the hardware privacy switches: the device is planned to have no fewer than six which will fully disconnect, at the hardware level, multiple functions: camera, microphone, Bluetooth, GPS, mobile network, and Wi-Fi. That frankly seems like overkill, but we&#39;re sure that it will make some extremely privacy-conscious buyers salivate.

Although it&#39;s not been around as long as Nex, this is Brax Tech&#39;s third product launch, and we will be watching with interest to see how close the shipping hardware matches the company&#39;s goals.

Thanks to Reg reader RobX for telling us about the NexPhone.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Security concerns for the new agentic AI tool formerly known as Clawdbot remain, despite a rebrand prompted by trademark concerns raised by Anthropic. Would you be comfortable handing the keys to your identity kingdom over to a bot, one that might be exposed to the open internet?

Clawdbot, now known as Moltbot, has gone viral in AI and developer circles in recent days, with fans hailing the open-source &quot;AI personal assistant&quot; as a potential breakthrough.

The long and short of it is that Moltbot can be controlled using messaging apps, like WhatsApp and Telegram, in a similar way to the GenAI chatbots everyone knows about.

Taking things a little further, its agentic capabilities allow it to take care of life admin for users, such as responding to emails, managing calendars, screening phone calls, or booking table reservations – all with minimal intervention or prompting from the user.

All that functionality comes at a cost, however, and not just the outlay so many seem to be making on Mac Mini purchases for the sole purpose of hosting a Moltbot instance.

In order for Moltbot to read and respond to emails, and all the rest of it, it needs access to accounts and their credentials. Users are handing over the keys to their encrypted messenger apps, phone numbers, and bank accounts to this agentic system.

Naturally, security experts have had a few things to say about it.

First, there was the furor around public exposures. Moltbot is a complex system, and despite being as easy to install as a typical app on the face of it, the misconfigurations associated with it prompted experts to highlight the dangers of running Moltbot instances without the proper know-how.

Jamieson O&#39;Reilly, founder of red-teaming company Dvuln, was among the first to draw attention to the issue, saying that he saw hundreds of Clawdbot instances exposed to the web, potentially leaking secrets.

He told The Register that the attack model he reported to Moltbot&#39;s developers, which involved proxy misconfigurations and localhost connections auto-authenticating, is now fixed. However, if exploited, it could have allowed attackers to access months of private messages, account credentials, API keys, and more – anything to which Clawdbot owners gave it access.

According to his Shodan scans, supported by others looking into the matter, he found hundreds of instances exposed to the web. If those had open ports allowing unauthenticated admin connections, it would allow attackers access to the full breadth of secrets in Moltbot.

&quot;Of the instances I&#39;ve examined manually, eight were open with no authentication at all and exposing full access to run commands and view configuration data,&quot; he said. &quot;The rest had varying levels of protection.

&quot;Forty-seven had working authentication, which I manually confirmed was secure. The remainder fell somewhere in between. Some appeared to be test deployments, some were misconfigured in ways that reduced but didn&#39;t eliminate exposure.&quot;

On Tuesday, O&#39;Reilly published a second blog detailing a proof-of-concept supply chain exploit for ClawdHub – the AI assistant&#39;s skills library, the name of which has not yet changed.

He was able to upload a publicly available skill, artificially inflate the download count to more than 4,000, and watch as developers from seven countries downloaded the poisoned package.

The skill O&#39;Reilly uploaded was benign, but it proved he could have executed commands on a Moltbot instance.

&quot;The payload pinged my server to prove execution occurred, but I deliberately excluded hostnames, file contents, credentials, and everything else I could have taken,&quot; he said.

&quot;This was a proof of concept, a demonstration of what&#39;s possible. In the hands of someone less scrupulous, those developers would have had their SSH keys, AWS credentials, and entire codebases exfiltrated before they knew anything was wrong.&quot;

ClawdHub states in its developer notes that all code downloaded from the library will be treated as trusted code – there is no moderation process at present – so it&#39;s up to developers to properly vet anything they download.

Therein lies one of the key issues with the product. It is being heralded by nerds as the next big AI offering, one that can benefit everyone, but in reality, it requires a specialist skillset in order to use safely.

Eric Schwake, director of cybersecurity strategy at Salt Security, told The Register: &quot;A significant gap exists between the consumer enthusiasm for Clawdbot&#39;s one-click appeal and the technical expertise needed to operate a secure agentic gateway.

&quot;While installing it may resemble a typical Mac app, proper configuration requires a thorough understanding of API posture governance to prevent credential exposure due to misconfigurations or weak authentication.

&quot;Many users unintentionally create a large visibility void by failing to track which corporate and personal tokens they&#39;ve shared with the system. Without enterprise-level insight into these hidden connections, even a small mistake in a &#39;prosumer&#39; setup can turn a useful tool into an open back door, risking exposure of both home and work data to attackers.&quot;

The security concerns surrounding Moltbot persist even when it is set up correctly, as the team at Hudson Rock pointed out this week.

Its researchers said they looked at Moltbot&#39;s code and found that some of the secrets shared with the assistant by users were stored in plaintext Markdown and JSON files on the user&#39;s local filesystem.

The implication here is that if a host machine, such as one of the Mac Minis being bought en masse to host Moltbot, were infected with infostealer malware, then it would mean the secrets stored by the AI assistant could be compromised.

Hudson Rock is already seeing malware as a service families implement capabilities to target local-first directory structures, such as those used by Moltbot, including Redline, Lumma, and Vidar.

It is fathomable that any of these popular strains of malware could be deployed against the internet-exposed Moltbot instances to steal credentials and carry out financially motivated attacks.

If the attacker is also able to gain write access, then they can turn Moltbot into a backdoor, instructing it to siphon sensitive data in the future, trust malicious sources, and more.

&quot;Clawdbot represents the future of personal AI, but its security posture relies on an outdated model of endpoint trust,&quot; said Hudson Rock. &quot;Without encryption-at-rest or containerization, the &#39;Local-First&#39; AI revolution risks becoming a goldmine for the global cybercrime economy.&quot;

O&#39;Reilly said that Moltbot&#39;s security has captured the attention of the industry recently, but it is only the latest example of experts warning about the risks associated with wider deployments of AI agents.

In a recent interview with The Register, Palo Alto Networks chief security intel officer Wendi Whitmore warned that AI agents could represent the new era of insider threats.

As they are deployed across large organizations, trusted to carry out tasks autonomously, they become increasingly attractive targets for attackers looking to hijack these agents for personal gain.

The key will be to ensure cybersecurity is rethought for the agentic era, ensuring each agent is afforded the least privileges necessary to carry out tasks, and that malicious activity is monitored stringently.

&quot;The deeper issue is that we&#39;ve spent 20 years building security boundaries into modern operating systems,&quot; said O&#39;Reilly. &quot;Sandboxing, process isolation, permission models, firewalls, separating the user&#39;s internal environment from the internet. All of that work was designed to limit blast radius and prevent remote access to local resources.

&quot;AI agents tear all of that down by design. They need to read your files, access your credentials, execute commands, and interact with external services. The value proposition requires punching holes through every boundary we spent decades building. When these agents are exposed to the internet or compromised through supply chains, attackers inherit all of that access. The walls come down.&quot;

Heather Adkins, VP of security engineering at Google Cloud, who last week warned of the risks AI would present to the world of underground malware toolkits, is flying the flag for the anti-Moltbot brigade, urging people to avoid installing it.

&quot;My threat model is not your threat model, but it should be. Don&#39;t run Clawdbot,&quot; she said, citing a separate security researcher who claimed Moltbot &quot;is an infostealer malware disguised as an AI personal assistant.&quot;

Principal security consultant Yassine Aboukir said: &quot;How could someone trust that thing with full system access?&quot; ®

            <h2>European firms push on with AI pilots even as payoff doubts grow</h2>
            <p><strong>The Register | 2026-01-27</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2026/01/27/emea_ai_idc_lenovo/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Despite a growing number of reports that AI is not benefiting many businesses, Lenovo and IDC say that firms in EMEA are pushing ahead with pilot deployments and still expect it to drive growth and transform how they operate.

Lenovo&#39;s newly-published CIO Playbook 2026 claims that enterprises across Europe and the Middle East are accelerating their adoption of AI and view it as a key business enabler as they seek speedier growth and better business outcomes.

Based on research carried out by IDC, the report says that some organizations are projecting average returns of $2.78 for every dollar invested in AI projects, but there are considerable challenges to realizing this goal. These include employee skills, having the right infrastructure, robust data security, sovereignty, and governance measures.

The report makes it clear that AI is not just one technology, but an umbrella term that covers things such as predictive and interpretive AI, as well as the generative and agentic types that have been the focus of much hype and attention lately.

IDC&#39;s AI Research Director for Europe, Ewa Zborowska, says that compared with 2024, more businesses are now moving beyond the early stages of investigating and playing around with AI, and toward planning and running pilot deployments.

&quot;Almost 60 percent of companies today say they are piloting, they are running proof of concepts, so really seeking value in AI adoption, or already adopting AI systematically, meaning it&#39;s part of their business day-to-day,&quot; she commented.

Businesses are mostly applying AI in IT-related areas, according to Zborowska, such as cybersecurity or software development, where processes are in place and a lot of data is already available to make use of. &quot;But we are also increasingly seeing customers saying AI is something that is helping us with R&D generally, in operations, customer service, and marketing,&quot; she added.

IDC&#39;s research covered 800 IT and business decision-makers across the EMEA region.

Almost all of those surveyed (94 percent) expect to see a positive return on the investment they are plowing into these AI initiatives.

However, the reality has proven very different in some recent studies. Research from professional services firm Deloitte showed that adopting AI tools had not helped the bottom line at all for most companies. A PwC survey of 4,454 business leaders found that more than half of CEOs indicated they had seen neither increased revenue nor decreased costs from their AI deployments.

Meanwhile, customers are increasingly looking to non-financial benefits from AI, according to Zborowska.

&quot;So KPIs (key performance indicators) that are not expressed in &#39;we invested X dollars and we got Y dollars out of this,&#39; they are looking at, are our employees more engaged, are they happy with the tools that they are getting? Has their work improved in any way? How do AI implementations impact our customers&#39; experience, are we making decisions internally in a more efficient way?&quot; she commented, adding that she expected to see non-financial benefits become more prominent in studies over the next few years.

But challenges still remain, including training and upskilling of both IT teams and business users, the report says, and that AI is not going to run well in production without efficient AI infrastructure.

The latter is where Lenovo&#39;s interest in the report comes in, of course, as the firm is a global supplier of servers and related infrastructure. IDC placed it joint third in global server market revenue for the third quarter of 2025.

In this study, IDC found that hybrid deployment is the preferred model, with 82 percent of organizations looking to a mix of on-premises or edge infrastructure, with public cloud appearing to be the minority choice. This is a turnaround from model training, where the hyperscale public cloud operators have been among the biggest beneficiaries of AI investment.

More than half of companies reported that they have yet to develop AI governance, risk and compliance policies, or are in the process of doing so. Only 27 percent indicated they have comprehensive guidelines and practices that rigorously address security, data protection, privacy, and AI sovereignty.

For 2026, IDC says it expects to see enterprise spending on AI continue to rise, and that it will become a core part of business performance. The report also says that agentic AI will emerge as the next step in workflow automation, though this needs to be applied with caution. ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Flush with cash from skyrocketing memory prices, Micron continued its fab expansion this week, this time breaking ground on a $24 billion manufacturing complex that will eventually produce chips used in storage devices.

Located at Micron&#39;s long-standing foundry complex in Singapore, the facility is expected to swell to 700,000 square feet of clean room space over the next 10 years and create around 1,600 new jobs in the city state.

However, consumers grappling with surging memory and storage prices won&#39;t have to wait quite that long for relief. Micron says the plant should start pumping out NAND flash modules in the second half of 2028. Just another 2.5 years of memory winter to go.

The ground breaking comes a year after Micron announced a $7 billion advanced packaging and test facility at the same Singapore site. That plant will be responsible for the final assembly and testing of high bandwidth memory (HBM) used in GPUs and AI accelerators. Micron says the plant should begin contributing meaningfully to HBM supply starting next year.

Combined with its new NAND flash fab, Micron now expects to expand its headcount by around 3,000 workers.

Micron&#39;s Singapore expansion comes a week after the US chipmaker acquired a fab complex from Taiwan&#39;s Powerchip Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (PSMC).

The American memory vendor plans to retrofit the facility to produce DRAM chips used in everything from smartphones and laptops to servers and AI accelerators. But like most of its other fab projects it won&#39;t happen overnight. Micron wagers it can start churning out DRAM wafers by mid-to-late 2027.

Micron isn&#39;t just expanding its operations abroad. Earlier this month the company broke ground on its largest ever chip fab.

Micron says that the $100 billion project, located in New York State, will take roughly 20 years to complete and will eventually grow to four massive fab complexes spanning 1.2 million square feet. The first two fabs are slated to begin operations around the end of the decade.

Unfortunately for consumers there&#39;s no quick fix to the current memory crisis, Micron CEO Sanjay Mehrotra said during the company&#39;s Q1 2026 earnings call last month. &quot;We believe that the aggregate industry supply will remain substantially short of the demand for the foreseeable future.&quot;

How far into the future? According to the analysts at TechInsights, DRAM prices won&#39;t peak until later this year, before plateauing in 2027 and then rising again in 2028 as chip vendors begin transitioning to HBM4e. ®

            <p><strong>The Register | 2026-01-27</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2026/01/27/salesforce_5b_deal_agentic_ai_us_army/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Salesforce is getting cosier with the US Army via a deal worth up to $5.6 billion, selling cloud analytics as the groundwork for a future agentic AI push across the service and the wider DoD.

Salesforce announced the 10-year deal on Monday, which it said would equip the Army with a Salesforce-based cloud data analytics system &quot;as the foundation for its agentic enterprise,&quot; though the company also suggested in its release that Army agentic AI is still a plan for the future, not a thing that&#39;s being deployed alongside the new deal.

The cornerstone of the deal is Salesforce&#39;s Missionforce, its product portfolio launched in September 2025 to address the needs of government defense, intelligence, and aerospace agencies.

According to Salesforce Missionforce and Government Cloud CEO Kendall Collins, the deal brings Missionforce into service across the Army, unifying data and analytics while laying the groundwork for broader DoD use.

&quot;This new contract ... will operationalize Missionforce across the Army and DOW, delivering trusted data and seamless interoperability, and supporting the DOW&#39;s transformation into an agentic enterprise,&quot; Collins said, referring to the DoD as the Department of War, its unofficial nickname Trump assigned via executive order last year.

According to Salesforce, Missionforce will provide a one-stop shop for the Army and DoD to manage personnel from hiring to retirement, merge data sources under one dashboard to enable quicker decision making, streamline workflows, and lay the aforementioned &quot;agent-ready foundation&quot; for the Army&#39;s eventual widespread adoption of agentic AI.

It&#39;s worth pointing out that an agentic AI-powered Army isn&#39;t something Salesforce dreamed up – the Army itself, and the DoD as a whole, have been looking at adopting AI agents for some time. A report [PDF] from the Army&#39;s Defense Technical Information Center recommended an agentic AI adoption plan last year, and the Pentagon signed a large deal with Scale AI in March 2025 to bring agentic AI into the planning and operations sphere with help from Anduril and Microsoft.

In other words, this isn&#39;t Salesforce hoping to break new ground as much as get a slice of a pie that&#39;s already being served up.

This also isn&#39;t Salesforce&#39;s first foray into making deals with the US Army, as it previously integrated its technology into the Army Human Resources Command as part of a modernization effort, and into the Army Accessions Information Environment to &quot;accelerate and optimize recruiting pipelines,&quot; a move that appears to have already paid off for the branch, as 2025 recruiting numbers skyrocketed after years of declines, though that hasn&#39;t plugged the hole in high attrition rates.

Salesforce didn&#39;t immediately respond to questions for this story. ®

            <div id="article-text">Catholics need to develop critical thinking skills to counter the dark side of AI and counter unnatural attachments to chatbots, the pope said this week in a message marking the Church&#39;s social communications day.

American-born pope Leo XIV also called on AI creators and platform CEOs to think about something other than maximizing profit and plundering the cultural archive to feed their models.

And he said individuals had a duty to protect their own image, face, and voice to prevent nefarious uses of AI, from cyber bullying to deep fakes.

Pope Leo was speaking on the Church&#39;s 60th World Day of Social Communications, which falls on the feast of St Francis of Sales (as all good Salesians would of course know.)

&quot;Faces and voices are sacred,&quot; he reminded readers as &quot;God…created us in his image and likeness.&quot;

But he swiftly moved from the theological to the technological, warning: &quot;By simulating human voices and faces, wisdom and knowledge, consciousness and responsibility, empathy and friendship… artificial intelligence [could] not only interfere with information ecosystems, but also encroach upon the deepest level of communication, that of human relationships.&quot;

Pope Leo made no mention of a recent conference of exorcists which warned that AI could lead to &quot;new forms of necromancy and communication with the deceased.&quot;

But he said the drive to &quot;maximize engagement on social media&quot;, and group people into &quot;bubbles of easy consensus and easy outrage&quot; reduces populations&#39; ability to think crucially and made them more polarized.

This is &quot;further exacerbated by a naive and unquestioning reliance on artificial intelligence as an omniscient &#39;friend,&#39; a source of all knowledge, an archive of every memory, an &#39;oracle&#39; of all advice.&quot;

He said AI is turning people into &quot;passive consumers of unthought thoughts&quot; while &quot;the masterpieces of human genius in the fields of music, art and literature are being reduced to mere training grounds for machines.&quot;

Likewise, lack of transparency in algorithms and &quot;inadequate social representation of data&quot; will trap individuals in networks that can manipulate their thoughts, and exacerbate existing social inequality and injustices.

The Pontiff also highlighted the potential for disinformation and the need for real world reporting, else we descend into mistrust, confusion, and insecurity.&quot; (Francis of Sales is both the patron saint of journalists and the deaf.)

And he highlighted the fact that behind this &quot;enormous invisible force that affects us all&quot; are a handful of companies, giving rise to &quot;significant concerns about the oligopolistic control of algorithmic systems and artificial intelligence.&quot;

He said, &quot;The task laid before us is not to stop digital innovation, but rather to guide it and to be aware of its ambivalent nature.&quot; Each one of us needs to raise &quot;our voice in defense of human persons, so that we can truly assimilate these tools as allies.&quot;

This meant &quot;those at the helm of online platforms&quot; needed to ensure their business are about more than profit but also consider the common good. Developers need to practice transparency and promote &quot;informed consent.&quot;

More prosaically, AI-generated or manipulated content should be clearly labelled, while &quot;authorship and sovereign ownership of the work of journalists and other content creators must be protected.&quot;

And media, information, and AI literacy needs to be built into education at all levels, with Catholics developing critical thinking skills – and ensuring their God-given images are not pinched by scammers or AI models.

&quot;We need faces and voices to speak for people again,&quot; Leo concluded. &quot;We need to cherish the gift of communication as the deepest truth of humanity, to which all technological innovation should also be oriented.&quot; ®

The closures are part of a move to double down on expanding Whole Foods Market.

Amazon Go and Fresh physical store locations will soon be no more, with Amazon announcing on Tuesday that it’s closing up the majority of the stores and converting others into Whole Foods Market locations. Customers will still be able to order from Amazon Fresh online, but won’t be able to shop at physical stores with the same name. Amazon is also planning to expand its same-day delivery option for groceries and household essentials to more cities over the coming year.

The Go and Fresh closures come as Amazon doubles down on expanding the Whole Foods brand rather than its own in-house physical grocery stores. That expansion includes over 100 new Whole Foods Market locations opening over the next few years, along with five new locations for the smaller, convenience store-style Whole Foods Market Daily Shop.

Amazon also stated that it will still be “testing new physical store experiences,” like its Amazon Grocery location in Chicago and a Whole Foods concept store in Pennsylvania where shoppers can also purchase products from Amazon. Earlier this month, an Amazon proposal for a sprawling Walmart-like supercenter was approved in the Chicago suburb of Orland Park, Illinois. That development does not appear to be a Whole Foods Market, so Amazon’s plans for more of its own brick-and-mortar stores may still be in the works despite closing its book stores, 4-star stores, Pop Up shop, Style stores, and now Go and Fresh stores.

The cofounder of Spirit Crossing developer Spry Fox explains why the studio went back to being independent.

If you buy something from a Verge link, Vox Media may earn a commission. See our ethics statement.

When Netflix first acquired cozy game developer Spry Fox in 2022, it made a lot of sense. The studio had been around for over a decade and had several hits with mobile games like Triple Town and Alphabear. That approachable style of puzzle game seemed like a good fit for Netflix’s mobile-first strategy, and, as Spry Fox cofounder David Edery tells me, the partnership also meant that the team could focus on making the experiences they wanted to build without having to worry about monetization. “We just never were that good at making money from our games,” Edery explains.

Now, three years later, Spry Fox is once again independent after buying itself out from Netflix. The news comes as the streaming service’s fledgling gaming efforts are shifting, with a focus on TV-based games as opposed to mobile titles. Even studios behind successful games, like Squid Game: Unleashed, have been shuttered as part of the changes. But for Spry Fox, the decision to separate from Netflix was done for a different reason: to reach as large an audience as possible with the studio’s upcoming MMO Spirit Crossing.

“At some point, I increasingly became concerned about the fact that being a Netflix member-only game was a real issue for it,” Edery explains. “It’s a highly social game. People want to be able to play with their friends. If their friends are not Netflix members, that’s kind of a problem.”

Spirit Crossing is a large-scale multiplayer game about fostering friendship and community in a fantastical and adorable world. It’s the biggest experience the studio has ever made, but also feels like a natural progression; after achieving success with those early mobile titles, Spry Fox pushed further into the so-called “cozy” genre with the Animal Crossing-style series Cozy Grove. While those games are single-player, Spirit Crossing aims to do something similar but in a virtual world filled with lots of players. The goal is ambitious. “We genuinely believe this is our chance to reduce loneliness in the world,” says Edery. “That’s the sum total of everything that we care about.”

Development on Spirit Crossing predates the Netflix deal, and in fact represents something of a brief history of indie game funding over the last few years. The game’s initial prototype began life as an exclusive for Google’s Stadia streaming service. After Stadia’s high-profile implosion, Spry Fox retained ownership of the project, and eventually Epic picked up the game as part of its relatively new publishing initiative.

“We genuinely believe this is our chance to reduce loneliness in the world.”

“That was great because they were very supportive and they gave us a big budget,” Edery says of working with Epic. “And then the Netflix thing kind of came out of nowhere. I wasn’t looking to be acquired at the time, and I certainly didn’t think it would be Netflix of all companies, but they came by and it seemed like a good idea for a few different reasons.”

From the outside, Netflix’s efforts in gaming have seemed chaotic. The company has tried everything from games based on its shows to building a AAA studio without much success. Last year at the Game Developers Conference in San Francisco, Netflix’s president of games, Alain Tascan, outlined a new plan focused on specific types of games, including what he called “mainstream” titles aimed at large audiences, of which Spirit Crossing was shown as an example. Of late, however, Netflix seems mostly focused on cloud-based games played on TVs instead of phones.

Despite all of that, Edery says the team at Spry Fox wasn’t impacted much by Netflix’s changing priorities. “We were essentially brought in to make and launch Spirit Crossing,” he says. “We just kept doing what we were doing, so I think we were less affected by changes than maybe other folks internally would have been. We had a pretty clear vision and, for better or worse, we weren’t going to be steered off of that.”

Edery says that at each stage, from Stadia to Netflix, Spirit Crossing grew in scope and ambition. And eventually it became clear that a game built around connecting as many people as possible didn’t fit so snugly in Netflix’s plans, which limit the platforms a game can launch on. Edery notes that Cozy Grove, for example, was most successful on the Nintendo Switch, where cozy games are very popular. “Not being able to be on the Switch is a real limitation, possibly a really problematic limitation,” he says of Spirit Crossing.

“Not being able to be on the Switch is a real limitation”

So the split from Netflix was done in the best interest of the game; while a Switch version has yet to be announced, Spirit Crossing will be coming to PC in addition to the iPhone and Android. And there’s still a partnership with Netflix in place, as the mobile version will still be free and exclusive to subscribers. “It still has to make sense for Netflix,” Edery notes. But there are obvious risks involved in going independent, and already the team is making sacrifices. Edery says that he and fellow cofounder Daniel Cook have reduced their salaries to $20,000 a year.

The majority of development on Spirit Crossing was finished during the three years Spry Fox was under the Netflix umbrella, and the team expects to launch the game this year. (You can currently sign up to play an alpha of the game.) Even before Spirit Crossing launches, Spry Fox’s long journey back to independence represents a rare positive story in an industry plagued with layoffs, cancellations, and studio closures. But there’s one big thing the team still has left to do, and it’s not something Edery is looking forward to: “We have to figure out how to make money now.”

‘We’d not come between Apple and users, we’d come between Apple and their walled garden,‘ Reincubate’s CEO says.

Reincubate, which makes the Camo and Camo Studio apps for turning your iOS or Android phone into a webcam for your Mac or PC, is suing Apple, alleging anticompetitive conduct and patent infringement.

Camo first launched in 2020, but two years after, Apple launched a similar feature called Continuity Camera, which works just with Apple devices. Reincubate alleges that Apple “copied the technology” and “used its control over its operating systems and App Store to disadvantage that interoperable solution and redirect user demand to Apple’s own platform-tied offering,” according to the lawsuit.

“Camo was used by thousands of Apple employees, across all divisions of the company,” the lawsuit says. “At first, Apple encouraged Reincubate to increase its investment in Camo. But when Apple recognized that Camo was a threat—it took steps not only to copy it, thereby infringing Reincubate’s patents, but also to undermine Camo’s functionality such that Reincubate could not compete with Apple’s rip-off, called Continuity Camera, which was only operable between Apple devices and Mac computers.”

Reincubate CEO Aidan Fitzpatrick says in a blog post that Apple was an early supporter of Camo in beta, claiming that the company had “thousands of staff” running it internally and had made “all sorts of promises” about how they could help with the app. “Yet once we’d proven it could be done and users loved it, they took it and built our features into a billion iPhones, Macs, displays, iPads and TVs, while shutting us out and preventing additional interop we could provide to the ecosystem,” according to Fitzpatrick.

Fitzpatrick says he was “puzzled” by the launch of Continuity Camera. “Connecting two devices and seeking out a mount didn’t seem like the sort of setup that Apple would lean into. A global pandemic had been underway, and I figured that if Apple was focused on user needs, recognised the problems with their cameras and the move to remote and hybrid work, they might seek to rapidly replicate innovation, perhaps even with a point release, while also putting in play some multi-year initiative to lead with the cameras in MacBooks.”

But Fitzpatrick argues that they did neither, and says that “as I write this the webcams in many Windows devices still outclass the one in my MacBook.” If Apple wasn’t going to “tackle video holistically, why bother cutting our legs off? The answer soon became clear: we’d not come between Apple and users, we’d come between Apple and their walled garden.”

According to Fitzpatrick, this suit raises questions about larger concerns than Camo, namely, “whether there’s room for developers to stimulate the building blocks of the digital experience, or whether we must limit ourselves to building platforms that stand alone in the cloud, or ideas that are too insignificant to duplicate and freeze out.”

Apple didn’t immediately reply to a request for comment.

Buying separate chargers for your phone, watch, and earbuds adds up quickly. Anker’s MagGo Wireless Charging Station (Foldable 3-in-1) replaces all three, and now through January 30th it’s just $49.99 ($60 off) at Amazon-owned Woot. That’s the best price we’ve seen, and cheaper than many chargers designed for just one device.

The charging station delivers up to 15W of power to compatible MagSafe iPhones while pulling double duty as an adjustable phone stand, making it easy to check notifications at a glance. For Apple Watch owners, it supports fast charging on newer models like the Apple Watch Series 11. In between, there’s a Qi charging pad that outputs up to 5W for AirPods or other earbuds that support wireless charging.

The foldable design adds even more convenience. That makes it easy to toss in a bag — especially since it weighs less than the iPhone 17 Pro — and even when left out, it helps keep your desk tidy by replacing multiple chargers and stacking your phone, watch, and earbuds vertically rather than taking up space side by side. Rounding things out, Anker includes a 40W USB-C power adapter and a five-foot USB-C–to–USB-C cable, so you have everything you need to get started charging right out of the box.

The new ‘Strict Account Settings’ automatically block attachments and media from senders you don’t know, and also silences calls from unknown contacts.

WhatsApp is launching new “Strict Account Settings” that add even more protections against cyberattacks. The feature is built for people at a high-risk of attacks — such as journalists or public figures — and automatically blocks attachments and media from senders you don’t know, while silencing calls from unknown contacts.

The new setting limits other functionality inside WhatsApp, including turning off link previews, limiting who can add you to a group, and blocking non-contacts from seeing your profile photo, “about” details, and online status. “You should only turn this on if you think you may be a target of a sophisticated cyber campaign,” WhatsApp says. “Most people are not targeted by such attacks.”

WhatsApp has long offered end-to-end encryption, and bolstered its security even more after users were targeted with the NSO Group’s Pegasus spyware, which allowed bad actors to gain access to someone’s device through a phone call. Meta, WhatsApp’s parent company, later sued the NSO Group and received $167.25 million in damages. WhatsApp also shut down a spyware campaign targeting journalists and civil society members last year.

Meta is currently facing a lawsuit that claims the company and WhatsApp can access private WhatsApp chats. Andy Stone, Meta’s head of communications, has pushed back on these claims, telling Bloomberg that the lawsuit is “a frivolous work of fiction,” as WhatsApp uses the Signal protocol for encryption.

Strict Account Settings will roll out in the coming weeks, and you can turn it on by opening WhatsApp settings, selecting “Privacy,” tapping “Advanced,” and then selecting the option. WhatsApp notes that you can only turn on this feature from your primary device — not on WhatsApp for the web.

﻿An outage that started Sunday morning got the new US-specific version of TikTok off to a terrible start.

As we moved into the third day of the TikTokalypse, the app appears to have finally stabilized in the US, as we verified that it’s possible to consistently publish new videos and even have other people watch them. That hasn’t been a simple task since the service started having problems early Sunday morning, but on Tuesday morning, I was able to post a new short video and watch one published by my colleague in the UK.

A statement from TikTok USDS, the new Trump admin-assigned owners and operators of the brand in the United States, said it has “made significant progress in recovering our U.S. infrastructure” with its still-unnamed US data center partner. It also noted that US users may continue to experience some bugs, particularly when it comes to posting new content. While I am able to see videos from outside the US, a newly created UK account failed to load, as well as a number of other profiles.

TikTok USDS has said that the problem started due to a power outage at a data center, followed by a “cascading systems failure.” In the meantime, theories and rumors have swirled about TikTok’s new terms of service, the goals of its new owners, how the algorithm in the US may be manipulated, and the possibility of censorship around topics like ICE’s actions in Minneapolis and Jeffrey Epstein. A number of people have said they’re leaving the service and deleting their accounts, while some have suggested using different apps like UpScrolled.

How any of that may have changed behind the scenes or may change in the future is impossible to tell without a much broader analysis, but the service does appear to be operational again, brainrot videos and all.

We’ve made significant progress in recovering our U.S. infrastructure with our U.S. data center partner. However, the U.S. user experience may still have some technical issues, including when posting new content. We’re committed to bringing TikTok back to its full capacity as soon as possible. We’ll continue to provide updates. Thanks for your patience.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">When Elon Musk was at Davos last week, an interviewer asked him if he thought aging could be reversed. Musk said he hasn’t put much time into the problem but suspects it is “very solvable” and that when scientists discover why we age, it’s going to be something “obvious.”

Not long after, the Harvard professor and life-extension evangelist David Sinclair jumped into the conversation on X to strongly agree with the world’s richest man. “Aging has a relatively simple explanation and is apparently reversible,” wrote Sinclair. “Clinical Trials begin shortly.”

ER-100 turns out to be the code name of a treatment created by Life Biosciences, a small Boston startup that Sinclair cofounded and which he confirmed today has won FDA approval to proceed with the first targeted attempt at age reversal in human volunteers.

The company plans to try to treat eye disease with a radical rejuvenation concept called “reprogramming” that has recently attracted hundreds of millions in investment for Silicon Valley firms like Altos Labs, New Limit, and Retro Biosciences, backed by many of the biggest names in tech.

The technique attempts to restore cells to a healthier state by broadly resetting their epigenetic controls—switches on our genes that determine which are turned on and off.

“Reprogramming is like the AI of the bio world. It’s the thing everyone is funding,” says Karl Pfleger, an investor who backs a smaller UK startup, Shift Bioscience. He says Sinclair’s company has recently been seeking additional funds to keep advancing its treatment.

Reprogramming is so powerful that it sometimes creates risks, even causing cancer in lab animals, but the version of the technique being advanced by Life Biosciences passed initial safety tests in animals.

But it’s still very complex. The trial will initially test the treatment on about a dozen patients with glaucoma, a condition where high pressure inside the eye damages the optic nerve. In the tests, viruses carrying three powerful reprogramming genes will be injected into one eye of each patient, according to a description of the study first posted in December.

To help make sure the process doesn’t go too far, the reprogramming genes will be under the control of a special genetic switch that turns them on only while the patients take a low dose of the antibiotic doxycycline. Initially, they will take the antibiotic for about two months while the effects are monitored.

Executives at the company have said for months that a trial could begin this year, sometimes characterizing it as a starting bell for a new era of age reversal. “It’s an incredibly big deal for us as an industry,” Michael Ringel, chief operating officer at Life Biosciences, said at an event this fall. “It’ll be the first time in human history, in the millennia of human history, of looking for something that rejuvenates … So watch this space.”

The technology is based on the Nobel Prize–winning discovery, 20 years ago, that introducing a few potent genes into a cell will cause it to turn back into a stem cell, just like those found in an early embryo that develop into the different specialized cell types. These genes, known as Yamanaka factors, have been likened to a “factory reset” button for cells.

But they’re dangerous, too. When turned on in a living animal, they can cause an eruption of tumors.

That is what led scientists to a new idea, termed “partial” or “transient” reprogramming. The idea is to limit exposure to the potent genes—or use only a subset of them—in the hope of making cells act younger without giving them complete amnesia about what their role in the body is.

In 2020, Sinclair claimed that such partial reprogramming could restore vision to mice after their optic nerves were smashed, saying there was even evidence that the nerves regrew. His report appeared on the cover of the influential journal Nature alongside the headline “Turning Back Time.”

Not all scientists agree that reprogramming really counts as age reversal. But Sinclair has doubled down. He’s been advancing the theory that the gradual loss of correct epigenetic information in our cells is, in fact, the ultimate cause of aging—just the kind of root cause that Musk was alluding to.

“Elon does seem to be paying attention to the field and [is] seemingly in sync with [my theory],” Sinclair said in an email.

Reprogramming isn’t the first longevity fix championed by Sinclair, who’s written best-selling books and commands stratospheric fees on the longevity lecture circuit. Previously, he touted the longevity benefits of molecules called sirtuins as well as resveratrol, a molecule found in red wine. But some critics say he greatly exaggerates scientific progress, pushback that culminated in a 2024 Wall Street Journal story that dubbed him a “reverse-aging guru” whose companies “have not panned out.”

Life Biosciences has been among those struggling companies. Initially formed in 2017, it at first had a strategy of launching subsidiaries, each intended to pursue one aspect of the aging problem. But after these made limited progress, in 2021 it hired a new CEO, Jerry McLaughlin, who has refocused its efforts  on Sinclair’s mouse vision results and the push toward a human trial.

The company has discussed the possibility of reprogramming other organs, including the brain. And Ringel, like Sinclair, entertains the idea that someday even whole-body rejuvenation might be feasible. But for now, it’s better to think of the study as a proof of concept that’s still far from a fountain of youth. “The optimistic case is this solves some blindness for certain people and catalyzes work in other indications,” says Pfleger, the investor. “It’s not like your doctor will be writing a prescription for a pill that will rejuvenate you.”

Life’s treatment also relies on an antibiotic switching mechanism that, while often used in lab animals, hasn’t been tried in humans before. Since the switch is built from gene components taken from E. coli and the herpes virus, it’s possible that it could cause an immune reaction in humans, scientists say.

“I was always thinking that for widespread use you might need a different system,” says Noah Davidsohn, who helped Sinclair implement the technique and is now chief scientist at a different company, Rejuvenate Bio. And Life’s choice of reprogramming factors—it’s picked three, which go by the acronym OSK—may also be risky. They are expected to turn on hundreds of other genes, and in some circumstances the combination can cause cells to revert to a very primitive, stem-cell-like state.

Other companies studying reprogramming say their focus is on researching which genes to use, in order to achieve time reversal without unwanted side effects. New Limit, which has been carrying out an extensive search for such genes, says it won’t be ready for a human study for two years. At Shift, experiments on animals are only beginning now.

“Are their factors the best version of rejuvenation? We don’t think they are. I think they are working with what they’ve got,” Daniel Ives, the CEO of Shift, says of Life Biosciences. “But I think they’re way ahead of anybody else in terms of getting into humans. They have found a route forward in the eye, which is a nice self-contained system. If it goes wrong, you’ve still got one left.”

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">OpenAI just revealed what its new in-house team, OpenAI for Science, has been up to. The firm has released a free LLM-powered tool for scientists called Prism, which embeds ChatGPT in a text editor for writing scientific papers.

The idea is to put ChatGPT front and center inside software that scientists use to write up their work in much the same way that chatbots are now embedded into popular programming editors. It’s vibe coding, but for science.

Kevin Weil, head of OpenAI for Science, pushes that analogy himself. “I think 2026 will be for AI and science what 2025 was for AI in software engineering,” he said at a press briefing yesterday. “We’re starting to see that same kind of inflection.”

OpenAI claims that around 1.3 million scientists around the world submit more than 8 million queries a week to ChatGPT on advanced topics in science and math. “That tells us that AI is moving from curiosity to core workflow for scientists,” Weil said.

Prism is a response to that user behavior. It can also be seen as a bid to lock in more scientists to OpenAI’s products in a marketplace full of rival chatbots.

“I mostly use GPT-5 for writing code,” says Roland Dunbrack, a professor of biology at the Fox Chase Cancer Center in Philadelphia, who is not connected to OpenAI. “Occasionally, I ask LLMs a scientific question, basically hoping it can find information in the literature faster than I can. It used to hallucinate references but does not seem to do that very much anymore.”

Nikita Zhivotovskiy, a statistician at the University of California, Berkeley, says GPT-5 has already become an important tool in his work. “It sometimes helps polish the text of papers, catching mathematical typos or bugs, and provides generally useful feedback,” he says. “It is extremely helpful for quick summarization of research articles, making interaction with the scientific literature smoother.”

By combining a chatbot with an everyday piece of software, Prism follows a trend set by products such as OpenAI’s Atlas, which embeds ChatGPT in a web browser, as well as LLM-powered office tools from firms such as Microsoft and Google DeepMind.

Prism incorporates GPT-5.2, the company’s best model yet for mathematical and scientific problem-solving, into an editor for writing documents in LaTeX, a common coding language that scientists use for formatting scientific papers.

A ChatGPT chat box sits at the bottom of the screen, below a view of the article being written. Scientists can call on ChatGPT for anything they want. It can help them draft the text, summarize related articles, manage their citations, turn photos of whiteboard scribbles into equations or diagrams, or talk through hypotheses or mathematical proofs.

It’s clear that Prism could be a huge time saver. It’s also clear that a lot of people may be disappointed, especially after weeks of high-profile social media chatter from researchers at the firm about how good GPT-5 is at solving math problems. Science is drowning in AI slop: Won&#39;t this just make it worse? Where is OpenAI’s fully automated AI scientist? And when will GPT-5 make a stunning new discovery?

That’s not the mission, says Weil. He would love to see GPT-5 make a discovery. But he doesn’t think that’s what will have the biggest impact on science, at least not in the near term.

“I think more powerfully—and with 100% probability—there’s going to be 10,000 advances in science that maybe wouldn’t have happened or wouldn&#39;t have happened as quickly, and AI will have been a contributor to that,” Weil told MIT Technology Review in an exclusive interview this week. “It won’t be this shining beacon—it will just be an incremental, compounding acceleration.”

Four ways to think about this year&#39;s reckoning.

By studying large language models as if they were living things instead of computer programs, scientists are discovering some of their secrets for the first time.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Today, an estimated 2.2 billion people still have either limited or no access to the internet, largely because they live in remote places. But that number could drop this year, thanks to tests of stratospheric airships, uncrewed aircraft, and other high-altitude platforms for internet delivery.

Even with nearly 10,000 active Starlink satellites in orbit and the OneWeb constellation of 650 satellites, solid internet coverage is not a given across vast swathes of the planet.

One of the most prominent efforts to plug the connectivity gap was Google X’s Loon project. Launched in 2011, it aimed to deliver access using high-altitude balloons stationed above predetermined spots on Earth. But the project faced literal headwinds—the Loons kept drifting away and new ones had to be released constantly, making the venture economically unfeasible.

Although Google shuttered the high-profile Loon in 2021, work on other kinds of high-altitude platform stations (HAPS) has continued behind the scenes. Now, several companies claim they have solved Loon’s problems with different designs—in particular, steerable airships and fixed-wing UAVs (unmanned aerial vehicles)—and are getting ready to prove the tech’s internet beaming potential starting this year, in tests above Japan and Indonesia.

Regulators, too, seem to be thinking seriously about HAPS. In mid-December, for example, the US Federal Aviation Administration released a 50-page document outlining how large numbers of HAPS could be integrated into American airspace. According to the US Census Bureau’s 2024 American Community Survey (ACS) data, some 8 million US households (4.5% of the population) still live completely offline, and HAPS proponents think the technology might get them connected more cheaply than alternatives.

Despite the optimism of the companies involved, though, some analysts remain cautious.

“The HAPS market has been really slow and challenging to develop,” says Dallas Kasaboski, a space industry analyst at the consultancy Analysis Mason. After all, Kasaboski says, the approach has struggled before: “A few companies were very interested in it, very ambitious about it, and then it just didn’t happen.”

Hovering in the thin air at altitudes above 12 miles, HAPS have a unique vantage point to beam down low-latency, high-speed connectivity directly to smartphone users in places too remote and too sparsely populated to justify the cost of laying fiber-optic cables or building ground-based cellular base stations.

“Mobile network operators have some commitment to provide coverage, but they frequently prefer to pay a fine than cover these remote areas,” says Pierre-Antoine Aubourg, chief technology officer of Aalto HAPS, a spinoff from the European aerospace manufacturer Airbus. “With HAPS, we make this remote connectivity case profitable.”

Aalto HAPS has built a solar-powered UAV with a 25-meter wingspan that has conducted many long-duration test flights in recent years. In April 2025 the craft, called Zephyr, broke a HAPS record by staying afloat for 67 consecutive days. The first months of 2026 will be busy for the company, according to Aubourg; Zephyr will do a test run over southern Japan to trial connectivity delivery to residents of some of the country’s smallest and most poorly connected inhabited islands.

Because of its unique geography, Japan is a perfect test bed for HAPS. Many of the country’s roughly 430 inhabited islands are remote, mountainous, and sparsely populated, making them too costly to connect with terrestrial cell towers. Aalto HAPS is partnering with Japan’s largest mobile network operators, NTT DOCOMO and the telecom satellite operator Space Compass, which want to use Zephyr as part of next-generation telecommunication infrastructure.

“Non-terrestrial networks have the potential to transform Japan’s communications ecosystem, addressing access to connectivity in hard-to-reach areas while supporting our country’s response to emergencies,” Shigehiro Hori, co-CEO of Space Compass, said in a statement.

Zephyr, Aubourg explains, will function like another cell tower in the NTT DOCOMO network, only it will be located well above the planet instead of on its surface. It will beam high-speed 5G connectivity to smartphone users without the need for the specialized terminals that are usually required to receive satellite internet. “For the user on the ground, there is no difference when they switch from the terrestrial network to the HAPS network,” Aubourg says. “It’s exactly the same frequency and the same network.”

New Mexico–based Sceye, which has developed a solar-powered helium-filled airship, is also eyeing Japan for pre-commercial trials of its stratospheric connectivity service this year. The firm, which extensively tested its slick 65-meter-long vehicle in 2025, is working with the Japanese telecommunications giant SoftBank. Just like NTT DOCOMO, Softbank is betting on HAPS to take its networks to another level.

Mikkel Frandsen, Sceye’s founder and CEO, says that his firm succeeded where Loon failed by betting on the advantages offered by the more controllable airship shape, intelligent avionics, and innovative batteries that can power an electric fan to keep the aircraft in place.

“Google’s Loon was groundbreaking, but they used a balloon form factor, and despite advanced algorithms—and the ability to change altitude to find desired wind directions and wind speeds—Loon’s system relied on favorable winds to stay over a target area, resulting in unpredictable station-seeking performance,” Frandsen says. “This required a large amount of balloons in the air to have relative certainty that one would stay over the area of operation, which was financially unviable.”

He adds that Sceye’s airship can “point into the wind” and more effectively maintain its position.

“We have significant surface area, providing enough physical space to lift 250-plus kilograms and host solar panels and batteries,” he says, “allowing Sceye to maintain power through day-night cycles, and therefore staying over an area of operation while maintaining altitude.”

Satellite internet currently comes at a price tag that can be too high for people in developing countries, says Kasaboski. For example, Starlink subscriptions start at $10 per month in Africa, but millions of people in these regions are surviving on a mere $2 a day.

Frandsen and Aubourg both claim that HAPS can connect the world’s unconnected more cheaply. Because satellites in low Earth orbit circle the planet at very high speeds, they quickly disappear from a ground terminal&#39;s view, meaning large quantities of those satellites are needed to provide continuous coverage. HAPS can hover, affording a constant view of a region, and more HAPS can be launched to meet higher demand.

“If you want to deliver connectivity with a low-Earth-orbit constellation into one place, you still need a complete constellation,” says Aubourg. “We can deliver connectivity with one aircraft to one location. And then we can tailor much more the size of the fleet according to the market coverage that we need.”

Starlink gets a lot of attention, but satellite internet has some major drawbacks, says Frandsen. A big one is that its bandwidth gets diluted once the number of users in an area grows.

In a recent interview, Starlink cofounder Elon Musk compared the Starlink beams to a flashlight. Given the distance at which those satellites orbit the planet, the cone is wide, covering a large area. That’s okay when users are few and far between, but it can become a problem with higher densities of users.

For example, Ukrainian defense technologists have said that Starlink bandwidth can drop on the front line to a mere 10 megabits per second, compared with the peak offering of 220 Mbps when drones and ground robots are in heavy use. Users in Indonesia, which like Japan is an island nation, also began reporting problems with Starlink shortly after the service was introduced in the country in 2024. Again, bandwidth declined as the number of subscribers grew.

In fact, Frandsen says, Starlink’s performance is less than optimal once the number of users exceeds one person per square kilometer. And that can happen almost anywhere—even relatively isolated island communities can have hundreds or thousands of residents in a small area. “There is a relationship between the altitude and the population you can serve,” Frandsen says. “You can’t bring space closer to the surface of the planet. So the telco companies want to use the stratosphere so that they can get out to more rural populations than they could otherwise serve.” Starlink did not respond to our queries about these challenges.

Sceye and Aalto HAPS see their stratospheric vehicles as part of integrated telecom networks that include both terrestrial cell towers and satellites. But they’re far from the only game in town.

World Mobile, a telecommunications company headquartered in London, thinks its hydrogen-powered high-altitude UAV can compete directly with satellite mega-constellations. The company acquired the HAPS developer Stratospheric Platforms last year. This year, it plans to flight-test an innovative phased array antenna, which it claims will be able to deliver bandwidth of 200 megabits per second (enough to enable ultra-HD video streaming to 500,000 users at the same time over an area of 15,000 square kilometers—equivalent to the coverage of more than 500 terrestrial cell towers, the company says).

Last year, World Mobile also signed a partnership with the Indonesian telecom operator Protelindo to build a prototype Stratomast aircraft, with tests scheduled to begin in late 2027.

Richard Deakin, CEO of World Mobile’s HAPS division World Mobile Stratospheric, says that just nine Stratomasts could supply Scotland’s 5.5 million residents with high-speed internet connectivity at a cost of £40 million ($54 million) per year. That’s equivalent to about 60 pence (80 cents) per person per month, he says. Starlink subscriptions in the UK, of which Scotland is a part, come at £75 ($100) per month.

Companies working on HAPS also extol the convenience of prompt deployments in areas struck by war or natural disasters like Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico, after which Loon played an important role. And they say that HAPS could make it possible for smaller nations to obtain complete control over their celestial internet-beaming infrastructure rather than relying on mega-constellations controlled by larger nations, a major boon at a time of rising geopolitical tensions and crumbling political alliances.

Analysts, however, remain cautious, projecting a HAPS market totaling a modest $1.9 billion by 2033. The satellite internet industry, on the other hand, is expected to be worth $33.44 billion by 2030, according to some estimates.

The use of HAPS for internet delivery to remote locations has been explored since the 1990s, about as long as the concept of low-Earth-orbit mega-constellations. The seemingly more cost-effective stratospheric technology, however, lost to the space fleets thanks to the falling cost of space launches and ambitious investment by Musk’s SpaceX.

Google wasn’t the only tech giant to explore the HAPS idea. Facebook also had a project, called Aquila, that was discontinued after it too faced technical difficulties. Although the current cohort of HAPS makers claim they have solved the challenges that killed their predecessors, Kasaboski warns that they’re playing a different game: catching up with now-established internet-beaming mega constellations. By the end of this year, it’ll be much clearer whether they stand a good chance of doing so.

Why chatbots are starting to check your age

How do tech companies check if their users are kids?This question has taken on new urgency recently thanks to growing concern about the dangers that can arise when children talk to AI chatbots. For years Big Tech asked for birthdays (that one could make up) to avoid violating child privacy laws, but they weren’t required to moderate content accordingly.Now, two developments over the last week show how quickly things are changing in the US and how this issue is becoming a new battleground, even among parents and child-safety advocates. Read the full story.

Humans have long dreamed of living among the stars, and for two decades hundreds of us have done so aboard the International Space Station (ISS). But a new era is about to begin in which private companies operate orbital outposts—with the promise of much greater access to space than before.

The ISS is aging and is expected to be brought down from orbit into the ocean in 2031. To replace it, NASA has awarded more than $500 million to several companies to develop private space stations, while others have built versions on their own. Read why we made them one of our 10 Breakthrough Technologies this year, and check out the rest of the list.

For much of the last 15 years, the energy entrepreneur has worked to develop long-haul transmission lines to carry wind power across the Great Plains, Midwest, and Southwest. But so far, he has little to show for the effort.

Skelly has long argued that building such lines and linking together the nation’s grids would accelerate the shift from coal- and natural-gas-fueled power plants to the renewables needed to cut the pollution driving climate change. But his previous business shut down in 2019, after halting two of its projects and selling off interests in three more.

            <div id="article-text">In the three years since ChatGPT’s explosive debut, OpenAI’s technology has upended a remarkable range of everyday activities at home, at work, in schools—anywhere people have a browser open or a phone out, which is everywhere.

Now OpenAI is making an explicit play for scientists. In October, the firm announced that it had launched a whole new team, called OpenAI for Science, dedicated to exploring how its large language models could help scientists and tweaking its tools to support them.

The last couple of months have seen a slew of social media posts and academic publications in which mathematicians, physicists, biologists, and others have described how LLMs (and OpenAI’s GPT-5 in particular) have helped them make a discovery or nudged them toward a solution they might otherwise have missed. In part, OpenAI for Science was set up to engage with this community.

And yet OpenAI is also late to the party. Google DeepMind, the rival firm behind groundbreaking scientific models such as AlphaFold and AlphaEvolve, has had an AI-for-science team for years. (When I spoke to Google DeepMind’s CEO and cofounder Demis Hassabis in 2023 about that team, he told me: “This is the reason I started DeepMind … In fact, it’s why I’ve worked my whole career in AI.”)

So why now? How does a push into science fit with OpenAI’s wider mission? And what exactly is the firm hoping to achieve?

I put these questions to Kevin Weil, a vice president at OpenAI who leads the new OpenAI for Science team, in an exclusive interview last week.

Weil is a product guy. He joined OpenAI a couple of years ago as chief product officer after being head of product at Twitter and Instagram. But he started out as a scientist. He got two-thirds of the way through a PhD in particle physics at Stanford University before ditching academia for the Silicon Valley dream. Weil is keen to highlight his pedigree: “I thought I was going to be a physics professor for the rest of my life,” he says. “I still read math books on vacation.”

Asked how OpenAI for Science fits with the firm’s existing lineup of white-collar productivity tools or the viral video app Sora, Weil recites the company mantra: “The mission of OpenAI is to try and build artificial general intelligence and, you know, make it beneficial for all of humanity.”

Just imagine the future impact this technology could have on science he says: New medicines, new materials, new devices. “Think about it helping us understand the nature of reality, helping us think through open problems. Maybe the biggest, most positive impact we’re going to see from AGI will actually be from its ability to accelerate science.”

He adds: “With GPT-5, we saw that becoming possible.”

As Weil tells it, LLMs are now good enough to be useful scientific collaborators. They can spitball ideas, suggest novel directions to explore, and find fruitful parallels between new problems and old solutions published in obscure journals decades ago or in foreign languages.

That wasn’t the case a year or so ago. Since it announced its first so-called reasoning model—a type of LLM that can break down problems into multiple steps and work through them one by one—in December 2024, OpenAI has been pushing the envelope of what the technology can do. Reasoning models have made LLMs far better at solving math and logic problems than they used to be. “You go back a few years and we were all collectively mind-blown that the models could get an 800 on the SAT,” says Weil.

But soon LLMs were acing math competitions and solving graduate-level physics problems. Last year, OpenAI and Google DeepMind both announced that their LLMs had achieved gold-medal-level performance in the International Math Olympiad, one of the toughest math contests in the world. “These models are no longer just better than 90% of grad students,” says Weil. “They’re really at the frontier of human abilities.”

That’s a huge claim, and it comes with caveats. Still, there’s no doubt that GPT-5, which includes a reasoning model,  is a big improvement on GPT-4 when it comes to complicated problem-solving. Measured against an industry benchmark known as GPQA, which includes more than 400 multiple-choice questions that test PhD-level knowledge in biology, physics, and chemistry, GPT-4 scores 39%, well below the human-expert baseline of around 70%. According to OpenAI, GPT-5.2 (the latest update to the model, released in December) scores 92%.

The excitement is evident—and perhaps excessive. In October, senior figures at OpenAI, including Weil, boasted on X that GPT-5 had found solutions to several unsolved math problems. Mathematicians were quick to point out that in fact what GPT-5 appeared to have done was dig up existing solutions in old research papers, including at least one written in German. That was still useful, but it wasn’t the achievement OpenAI seemed to have claimed. Weil and his colleagues deleted their posts.

Now Weil is more careful. It is often enough to find answers that exist but have been forgotten, he says: “We collectively stand on the shoulders of giants, and if LLMs can kind of accumulate that knowledge so that we don’t spend time struggling on a problem that is already solved, that’s an acceleration all of its own.”

He plays down the idea that LLMs are about to come up with a game-changing new discovery. “I don’t think models are there yet,” he says. “Maybe they’ll get there. I’m optimistic that they will.”

But, he insists, that’s not the mission: “Our mission is to accelerate science. And I don’t think the bar for the acceleration of science is, like, Einstein-level reimagining of an entire field.”

For Weil, the question is this: “Does science actually happen faster because scientists plus models can do much more, and do it more quickly, than scientists alone? I think we’re already seeing that.”

In November, OpenAI published a series of anecdotal case studies contributed by scientists, both inside and outside the company, that illustrated how they had used GPT-5 and how it had helped. “Most of the cases were scientists that were already using GPT-5 directly in their research and had come to us one way or another saying, ‘Look at what I’m able to do with these tools,’” says Weil.

The key things that GPT-5 seems to be good at are finding references and connections to existing work that scientists were not aware of, which sometimes sparks new ideas; helping scientists sketch mathematical proofs; and suggesting ways for scientists to test hypotheses in the lab.

“GPT 5.2 has read substantially every paper written in the last 30 years,” says Weil. “And it understands not just the field that a particular scientist is working in; it can bring together analogies from other, unrelated fields.”

“That’s incredibly powerful,” he continues. “You can always find a human collaborator in an adjacent field, but it’s difficult to find, you know, a thousand collaborators in all thousand adjacent fields that might matter. And in addition to that, I can work with the model late at night—it doesn’t sleep—and I can ask it 10 things in parallel, which is kind of awkward to do to a human.”

Most of the scientists OpenAI reached out to back up Weil’s position.

Robert Scherrer, a professor of physics and astronomy at Vanderbilt University, only played around with ChatGPT for fun (“I used to it rewrite the theme song for Gilligan’s Island in the style of Beowulf, which it did very well,” he tells me) until his Vanderbilt colleague Alex Lupsasca, a fellow physicist who now works at OpenAI, told him that GPT-5 had helped solve a problem he’d been working on.

Lupsasca gave Scherrer access to GPT-5 Pro, OpenAI’s $200-a-month premium subscription. “It managed to solve a problem that I and my graduate student could not solve despite working on it for several months,” says Scherrer.

It’s not perfect, he says: “GTP-5 still makes dumb mistakes. Of course, I do too, but the mistakes GPT-5 makes are even dumber.” And yet it keeps getting better, he says: “If current trends continue—and that’s a big if—I suspect that all scientists will be using LLMs soon.”

Derya Unutmaz, a professor of biology at the Jackson Laboratory, a nonprofit research institute, uses GPT-5 to brainstorm ideas, summarize papers, and plan experiments in his work studying the immune system. In the case study he shared with OpenAI, Unutmaz used GPT-5 to analyze an old data set that his team had previously looked at. The model came up with fresh insights and interpretations.

“LLMs are already essential for scientists,” he says. “When you can complete analysis of data sets that used to take months, not using them is not an option anymore.”

Nikita Zhivotovskiy, a statistician at the University of California, Berkeley, says he has been using LLMs in his research since the first version of ChatGPT came out.

Like Scherrer, he finds LLMs most useful when they highlight unexpected connections between his own work and existing results he did not know about. “I believe that LLMs are becoming an essential technical tool for scientists, much like computers and the internet did before,” he says. “I expect a long-term disadvantage for those who do not use them.”

But he does not expect LLMs to make novel discoveries anytime soon. “I have seen very few genuinely fresh ideas or arguments that would be worth a publication on their own,” he says. “So far, they seem to mainly combine existing results, sometimes incorrectly, rather than produce genuinely new approaches.”

I also contacted a handful of scientists who are not connected to OpenAI.

Andy Cooper, a professor of chemistry at the University of Liverpool and director of the Leverhulme Research Centre for Functional Materials Design, is less enthusiastic. “We have not found, yet, that LLMs are fundamentally changing the way that science is done,” he says. “But our recent results suggest that they do have a place.”

Cooper is leading a project to develop a so-called AI scientist that can fully automate parts of the scientific workflow. He says that his team doesn’t use LLMs to come up with ideas. But the tech is starting to prove useful as part of a wider automated system where an LLM can help direct robots, for example.

“My guess is that LLMs might stick more in robotic workflows, at least initially, because I’m not sure that people are ready to be told what to do by an LLM,” says Cooper. “I’m certainly not.”

LLMs may be becoming more and more useful, but caution is still key. In December, Jonathan Oppenheim, a scientist who works on quantum mechanics, called out a mistake that had made its way into a scientific journal. “OpenAI leadership are promoting a paper in Physics Letters B where GPT-5 proposed the main idea—possibly the first peer-reviewed paper where an LLM generated the core contribution,” Oppenheim posted on X. “One small problem: GPT-5’s idea tests the wrong thing.”

He continued: “GPT-5 was asked for a test that detects nonlinear theories. It provided a test that detects nonlocal ones. Related-sounding, but different. It’s like asking for a COVID test, and the LLM cheerfully hands you a test for chickenpox.”

It is clear that a lot of scientists are finding innovative and intuitive ways to engage with LLMs. It is also clear that the technology makes mistakes that can be so subtle even experts miss them.

Part of the problem is the way ChatGPT can flatter you into letting down your guard. As Oppenheim put it: “A core issue is that LLMs are being trained to validate the user, while science needs tools that challenge us.” In an extreme case, one individual (who was not a scientist) was persuaded by ChatGPT into thinking for months that he’d invented a new branch of mathematics.

Of course, Weil is well aware of the problem of hallucination. But he insists that newer models are hallucinating less and less. Even so, focusing on hallucination might be missing the point, he says.

“One of my teammates here, an ex math professor, said something that stuck with me,” says Weil. “He said: ‘When I’m doing research, if I’m bouncing ideas off a colleague, I’m wrong 90% of the time and that’s kind of the point. We’re both spitballing ideas and trying to find something that works.’”

“That’s actually a desirable place to be,” says Weil. “If you say enough wrong things and then somebody stumbles on a grain of truth and then the other person seizes on it and says, ‘Oh, yeah, that’s not quite right, but what if we—’ You gradually kind of find your trail through the woods.”

This is Weil’s core vision for OpenAI for Science. GPT-5 is good, but it is not an oracle. The value of this technology is in pointing people in new directions, not coming up with definitive answers, he says.

In fact, one of the things OpenAI is now looking at is making GPT-5 dial down its confidence when it delivers a response. Instead of saying Here’s the answer, it might tell scientists: Here’s something to consider.

“That’s actually something that we are spending a bunch of time on,” says Weil. “Trying to make sure that the model has some sort of epistemological humility.”

Another thing OpenAI is looking at is how to use GPT-5 to fact-check GPT-5. It’s often the case that if you feed one of GPT-5’s answers back into the model, it will pick it apart and highlight mistakes.

“You can kind of hook the model up as its own critic,” says Weil. “Then you can get a workflow where the model is thinking and then it goes to another model, and if that model finds things that it could improve, then it passes it back to the original model and says, ‘Hey, wait a minute—this part wasn’t right, but this part was interesting. Keep it.’ It’s almost like a couple of agents working together and you only see the output once it passes the critic.”

What Weil is describing also sounds a lot like what Google DeepMind did with AlphaEvolve, a tool that wrapped the firms LLM, Gemini, inside a wider system that filtered out the good responses from the bad and fed them back in again to be improved on. Google DeepMind has used AlphaEvolve to solve several real-world problems.

OpenAI faces stiff competition from rival firms, whose own LLMs can do most, if not all, of the things it claims for its own models. If that’s the case, why should scientists use GPT-5 instead of Gemini or Anthropic’s Claude, families of models that are themselves improving every year? Ultimately, OpenAI for Science may be as much an effort to plant a flag in new territory as anything else. The real innovations are still to come.

“I think 2026 will be for science what 2025 was for software engineering,” says Weil. “At the beginning of 2025, if you were using AI to write most of your code, you were an early adopter. Whereas 12 months later, if you’re not using AI to write most of your code, you’re probably falling behind. We’re now seeing those same early flashes for science as we did for code.”

He continues: “I think that in a year, if you’re a scientist and you’re not heavily using AI, you’ll be missing an opportunity to increase the quality and pace of your thinking.”

How do tech companies check if their users are kids?

This question has taken on new urgency recently thanks to growing concern about the dangers that can arise when children talk to AI chatbots. For years Big Tech asked for birthdays (that one could make up) to avoid violating child privacy laws, but they weren’t required to moderate content accordingly. Two developments over the last week show how quickly things are changing in the US and how this issue is becoming a new battleground, even among parents and child-safety advocates.

In one corner is the Republican Party, which has supported laws passed in several states that require sites with adult content to verify users’ ages. Critics say this provides cover to block anything deemed “harmful to minors,” which could include sex education. Other states, like California, are coming after AI companies with laws to protect kids who talk to chatbots (by requiring them to verify who’s a kid). Meanwhile, President Trump is attempting to keep AI regulation a national issue rather than allowing states to make their own rules. Support for various bills in Congress is constantly in flux.

So what might happen? The debate is quickly moving away from whether age verification is necessary and toward who will be responsible for it. This responsibility is a hot potato that no company wants to hold.

In a blog post last Tuesday, OpenAI revealed that it plans to roll out automatic age prediction. In short, the company will apply a model that uses factors like the time of day, among others, to predict whether a person chatting is under 18. For those identified as teens or children, ChatGPT will apply filters to “reduce exposure” to content like graphic violence or sexual role-play. YouTube launched something similar last year.

If you support age verification but are concerned about privacy, this might sound like a win. But there&#39;s a catch. The system is not perfect, of course, so it could classify a child as an adult or vice versa. People who are wrongly labeled under 18 can verify their identity by submitting a selfie or government ID to a company called Persona.

Selfie verifications have issues: They fail more often for people of color and those with certain disabilities. Sameer Hinduja, who co-directs the Cyberbullying Research Center, says the fact that Persona will need to hold millions of government IDs and masses of biometric data is another weak point. “When those get breached, we’ve exposed massive populations all at once,” he says.

Hinduja instead advocates for device-level verification, where a parent specifies a child’s age when setting up the child’s phone for the first time. This information is then kept on the device and shared securely with apps and websites.

That’s more or less what Tim Cook, the CEO of Apple, recently lobbied US lawmakers to call for. Cook was fighting lawmakers who wanted to require app stores to verify ages, which would saddle Apple with lots of liability.

More signals of where this is all headed will come on Wednesday, when the Federal Trade Commission—the agency that would be responsible for enforcing these new laws—is holding an all-day workshop on age verification. Apple’s head of government affairs, Nick Rossi, will be there. He’ll be joined by higher-ups in child safety at Google and Meta, as well as a company that specializes in marketing to children.

The FTC has become increasingly politicized under President Trump (his firing of the sole Democratic commissioner was struck down by a federal court, a decision that is now pending review by the US Supreme Court). In July, I wrote about signals that the agency is softening its stance toward AI companies. Indeed, in December, the FTC overturned a Biden-era ruling against an AI company that allowed people to flood the internet with fake product reviews, writing that it clashed with President Trump’s AI Action Plan.

Wednesday’s workshop may shed light on how partisan the FTC’s approach to age verification will be. Red states favor laws that require porn websites to verify ages (but critics warn this could be used to block a much wider range of content). Bethany Soye, a Republican state representative who is leading an effort to pass such a bill in her state of South Dakota, is scheduled to speak at the FTC meeting. The ACLU generally opposes laws requiring IDs to visit websites and has instead advocated for an expansion of existing parental controls.

While all this gets debated, though, AI has set the world of child safety on fire. We’re dealing with increased generation of child sexual abuse material, concerns (and lawsuits) about suicides and self-harm following chatbot conversations, and troubling evidence of kids’ forming attachments to AI companions. Colliding stances on privacy, politics, free expression, and surveillance will complicate any effort to find a solution. Write to me with your thoughts.

            <p><strong>The Next Web | 2026-01-26</strong></p>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Warsaw, Poland 26 January 2026 – Rainbow Weather has raised $5.5 million in seed funding to push weather forecasting further into the short-term, high-precision territory it believes the industry still underserves.

The Warsaw-based climate tech startup focuses on hyperlocal, minute-by-minute forecasts, zeroing in on what happens in the next few hours rather than days out.

The round was backed by a syndicate of investors, including Yuri Gurski, founder of Flo Health, one of Europe’s best-known consumer tech unicorns.

Rainbow Weather’s core product is a mobile app that delivers four-hour precipitation forecasts calculated from the exact moment a user checks the weather.

Open the app at 3:51 am, and it forecasts conditions through 7:51am, refreshed every 10 minutes and mapped down to a one-square-kilometre grid. That level of temporal and spatial precision is what the company says sets it apart from mainstream weather apps.

Most major providers, including AccuWeather, Apple Weather, and The Weather Company, still rely on approaches that either simplify cloud movement or depend on large-scale numerical models designed for longer forecasts. According to Rainbow Weather, both methods struggle when conditions change quickly.

“Many legacy forecasting providers rely on optical flow for short-term precipitation forecasting. That’s a fast but simplistic method that treats clouds as shapes in motion, without any understanding of atmospheric physics,” explained Alexander Matveenko, co-founder of Rainbow Weather. “A second category of services uses large-scale mathematical models that do incorporate physical principles, but they’re so cumbersome and slow that they can’t respond quickly to real-time weather changes.”

Rainbow Weather positions itself in between, using machine learning to fuse high-resolution data from radar, satellites, weather stations, and even smartphone barometers. By combining these sources, the company claims it can reduce the noise and bias inherent in individual datasets, then generate forecasts faster than traditional systems.

The app currently focuses on short-term precipitation, but it has expanded into tracking wildfires and hurricanes, a feature added after the Palisades fire in Los Angeles. That expansion reflects a broader ambition to become a real-time risk awareness tool, not just a rain predictor.

The new funding will be used to extend Rainbow Weather’s forecasting window from four hours to 24 hours, add more weather parameters beyond precipitation, and grow its B2B offering.

The commercial weather intelligence market is expected to grow steadily over the next decade, driven by industries that depend on precise, near-term forecasts, from logistics and agriculture to aviation and drone operations.

Rainbow Weather says it has surpassed one million installs and has launched APIs aimed at companies that “can’t afford to get weather wrong.” It has also partnered with an unnamed long-term forecasting firm, supplying near-term data to improve broader climate models.

The founding team brings a track record of exits in applied AI. CEO Yuriy Melnichek previously founded AIMatter, acquired by Google, as well as consumer apps later bought by Pinterest and Farfetch. Matveenko previously sold mapping startup MapData to Mapbox.

Alongside its commercial products, the team also runs weatherindex.ai, an open-source project that evaluates short-term precipitation forecasts from major providers in real time. The tool compares live forecasts against verified airport weather reports, using standard accuracy metrics. It’s an unusual move in an industry not known for transparent benchmarking.

For Rainbow Weather, that openness is part of the pitch. The company is betting that as climate volatility increases, users and businesses will care less about next week’s weather and more about what happens in the next hour, and whether the forecast can be trusted.

Rainbow Weather is a next-gen climate tech startup for ultra-accurate short-term forecasts founded in 2021 by Yuriy Melnichek, who previously built AIMatter (acquired by Google), a neural network-based AI platform, as well as the video creation and editing app Vochi (acquired by Pinterest), and fashion marketplace Wanna (acquired by Farfetch), and Alexander Matveenko, a founder of artificial intelligence mapping startup MapData that he sold to Mapbox in 2017.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">London-based AI video startup Synthesia has raised $200 million in a Series E round, nearly doubling its valuation to around $4 billion and cementing its position as one of Europe’s most valuable AI companies.

The round was led by Google Ventures, with participation from existing investors, underscoring continued appetite for applied AI products that have already found a clear commercial use.

Synthesia builds generative AI tools that let companies create videos using AI-generated avatars instead of cameras, studios, or presenters. The technology has found a strong foothold in corporate training, internal communications, and product explainers, areas where speed, scale, and consistency often matter more than production gloss.

“Synthesia was founded on two core beliefs: first, that AI will bring the cost of content creation down to zero. And secondly, that AI video provides a better, more engaging way for organizations to communicate and learn,” said Victor Riparbelli, Synthesia’s co-founder and CEO.

Synthesia says a significant share of Fortune 100 companies now use its platform, a rare level of enterprise penetration for a European AI startup at this stage. Rather than chasing consumer virality, the company has built its business around predictable, high-value enterprise use cases, a strategy investors have increasingly rewarded over the past year.

The funding comes at a moment when enthusiasm around generative AI has shifted from experimentation to execution. Enterprises are no longer asking whether AI video works, but how reliably it can plug into existing workflows.

Synthesia’s pitch is that AI-generated video should be as routine as slides or documents, created quickly, updated easily, and deployed globally without production bottlenecks.

At a $4 billion valuation, Synthesia joins a small group of European AI companies that have managed to scale beyond regional relevance.

Its rise also highlights a broader pattern: applied AI startups, focused on specific business functions rather than general-purpose models, are attracting some of the largest growth rounds in the market.

For the UK tech ecosystem, the deal is another signal that London remains a serious hub for commercial AI, even as regulatory debates continue around model safety, copyright, and synthetic media.

Synthesia has previously positioned itself as cautious about misuse, building safeguards around consent and disclosure for its avatars, a stance that may become more important as scrutiny of AI-generated content increases.

The challenge ahead is less about proving demand and more about maintaining trust and differentiation as competitors multiply.

But with deep enterprise adoption, a clear product focus, and backing from one of Silicon Valley’s most influential investors, Synthesia is entering its next phase with momentum firmly on its side.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Amsterdam-based hospitality tech platform Mews has raised €255 million (about $300 million) in a Series D funding round as it pushes deeper into automation and AI-powered workflows for hotels around the world.

The round was led by EQT Growth with new participation from Atomico and HarbourVest Partners, alongside existing backers including Kinnevik, Battery Ventures and Tiger Global. The investment values the company at roughly $2.5 billion.

Founded in 2012 by Richard Valtr and Matt Welle, Mews builds a cloud-native “operating system” for hotels  software that ties together reservations, check-ins, housekeeping, payments and more in one platform.

Its technology is designed to replace legacy systems that many hotels still rely on, offering a more flexible, connected way to manage day-to-day operations.

The new funding will be used to expand the company’s AI and automation capabilities at the core of its product.

That includes embedding agent-driven systems that can take on complex routine tasks, reduce manual work for staff and streamline how hotels handle everything from guest interactions to revenue management.

Mews says its platform already supports more than 15,000 properties in 85 countries, and in 2025 it processed nearly 42.3 million check-ins and handled nearly $20 billion in transaction volume.

The software also helped generate over $500 million in additional revenue for hoteliers through features like its Mews Spaces module.

In a statement, CEO Matt Welle said the new capital will help Mews build an operating system that handles operational complexity so hotel teams can focus on guest experience rather than juggling disparate tools.

“We are engineering an operating system that is changing how hoteliers interact with their guests,” CEO Matt Welle said, adding that the goal is to lighten the cognitive load on staff and make everyday operations smoother.

Industry observers say the round is one of the largest ever in hospitality software and reflects broader investor interest in infrastructure-level platforms that bring AI and fintech together for real-world business operations.

As hotels embrace digital transformation, technology that can automate workflows and personalise guest experiences  without adding complexity is increasingly in demand.

For Mews, the challenge now is execution: turning generous funding into tangible upgrades that deliver value for hoteliers of all sizes.

But with strong adoption, a global footprint and a growing suite of automation tools, the company is positioning itself as a central technology partner at a time when hotels are looking to modernise their operations and enhance guest satisfaction.
