            <h2>The TV industry finally concedes that the future may not be in 8K</h2>
            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-01-30</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2026/01/lg-joins-the-rest-of-the-world-accepts-that-people-dont-want-8k-tvs/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Technology companies spent part of the 2010s trying to convince us that we would want an 8K display one day.

In 2012, Sharp brought the first 8K TV prototype to the CES trade show in Las Vegas. In 2015, the first 8K TVs started selling in Japan for 16 million yen (about $133,034 at the time), and in 2018, Samsung released the first 8K TVs in the US, starting at a more reasonable $3,500. By 2016, the Video Electronics Standards Association (VESA) had a specification for supporting 8K (Display Port1.4), and the HDMI Forum followed suit (with HDMI 2.1). By 2017, Dell had an 8K computer monitor. In 2019, LG released the first 8K OLED TV, further pushing the industry’s claim that 8K TVs were “the future.”

However, 8K never proved its necessity or practicality.

LG Display is no longer making 8K LCD or OLED panels, FlatpanelsHD reported today. Earlier this month, an LG Display representative told FlatpanelsHD that the panel supplier is “taking a comprehensive view of current display market trends and the trends within the 8K content ecosystem.”

“As our technical readiness is already complete, LG Display is fully prepared to respond immediately whenever the market and customers determine that the timing is right,” LG Display’s representative said.

LG Electronics was the first and only company to sell 8K OLED TVs, starting with the 88-inch Z9 in 2019. In 2022, it lowered the price-of-entry for an 8K OLED TV by $7,000 by charging $13,000 for a 76.7-inch TV.

FlatpanelsHD cited anonymous sources who said that LG Electronics would no longer restock the 2024 QNED99T, which is the last LCD 8K TV that it released.

LG’s 8K abandonment follows other brands distancing themselves from 8K. TCL, which released its last 8K TV in 2021, said in 2023 that it wasn’t making more 8K TVs due to low demand. Sony discontinued its last 8K TVs in April and is unlikely to return to the market, as it plans to sell the majority ownership of its Bravia TVs to TCL.

The tech industry tried to convince people that the 8K living room was coming soon. But since the 2010s, people have mostly adopted 4K. In September 2024, research firm Omdia reported that there were “nearly 1 billion 4K TVs currently in use.” In comparison, 1.6 million 8K TVs had been sold since 2015, Paul Gray, Omdia’s TV and video technology analyst, said, noting that 8K TV sales peaked in 2022.

That helps explain why membership at the 8K Association, launched by stakeholders Samsung, TCL, Hisense, and panel maker AU Optronics in 2019, is dwindling. As of this writing, the group’s membership page lists 16 companies, including just two TV manufacturers (Samsung and Panasonic). Membership no longer includes any major TV panel suppliers. At the end of 2022, the 8K Association had 33 members, per an archived version of the nonprofit’s online membership page via the Internet Archive’s Wayback Machine. Upon its debut, the 8K Association said that its goals include “promoting 8K TVs and 8K content to consumers and professionals” and “helping secure 8K native content for members.”

It wasn’t hard to predict that 8K TVs wouldn’t take off. In addition to being too expensive for many households, there’s been virtually zero native 8K content available to make investing in an 8K display worthwhile. An ongoing lack of content was also easy to predict, given that there’s still a dearth of 4K content, and many streaming, broadcasting, and gaming users still rely on 1920×1080 resolution.

Gaming was supposed to be one of the best drivers for 8K adoption. The PlayStation 5 (PS5) Pro was originally marketed as supporting 8K. Sony officially rescinded that promise in June 2024, though. Due to bandwidth limitations, the PS5 Pro could only deliver 8K via Display Stream Compression over HDMI 2.1, making the feature incompatible with some 8K TVs.

There’s also the crucial question of whether people would even notice the difference between 4K and 8K. Science suggests that you could, but in limited situations.

The University of Cambridge’s display resolution calculator, which is based on a study from researchers at the university’s Department of Computer Science and Technology and Meta, funded by Meta, and published in Nature in October, suggests that your eyes can only make use of 8K resolution on a 50-inch screen if you’re viewing it from a distance of 1 meter (3.3 feet) or less. Similarly, you would have to be sitting pretty close (2–3 meters/6.6–9.8 feet) to an 80-inch or 100-inch TV for 8K resolution to be beneficial. The findings are similar to those from RTINGs.com.

Even those interested in spending a lot of money on new-age TV technologies are more likely to investigate features other than 8K, like OLED, HDR support, Micro LED, quantum dots, or even the newer Micro RGB panel tech. Any of those is likely to have a more dramatic impact on home theaters than moving from 4K to 8K.

With the above-mentioned obstacles, many technologists foresaw 8K failing to live up to tech companies’ promises. That’s not to say that 8K is dead. You can still buy an 8K TV from Samsung, which has 8K TVs with MSRPs starting at $2,500 (for 65 inches), and LG (until stock runs out). With manufacturers refraining from completely ruling out a return to 8K, it’s possible that 8K TVs will become relevant for enthusiasts or niche use cases for many years. And there are uses for high-resolution displays outside of TVs, like in head-mounted displays.

However, 8K TV options are shrinking. We’re far from the days when companies argued over which had the most “real 8K” TVs. If there is a future where 8K TVs reign, it’s one far from today.</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Minnesota resident Nicole Cleland had her Global Entry and TSA Precheck privileges revoked three days after an incident in which she observed activity by immigration agents, the woman said in a court declaration. An agent told Cleland that he used facial recognition technology to identify her, she wrote in a declaration filed in US District Court for the District of Minnesota.

Cleland, a 56-year-old resident of Richfield and a director at Target Corporation, volunteers with a group that tracks potential Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and Customs and Border Protection (CBP) vehicles in her neighborhood, according to her declaration. On the morning of January 10, she “observed a white Dodge Ram being driven by what I believed to be federal enforcement agents” and “maneuvered behind the vehicle with the intent of observing the agents’ actions.”

Cleland said that she and another observer in a different car followed the Dodge Ram because of “concern about a local apartment building being raided.” She followed the car for a short time and from a safe distance until “the Dodge Ram stopped in front of the other commuter’s vehicle,” she wrote. Cleland said two other vehicles apparently driven by federal agents stopped in front of the Dodge Ram, and her path forward was blocked.

“An agent exited the vehicle and approached my vehicle,” Cleland wrote. “I remained in my vehicle. The agent addressed me by my name and informed me that they had ‘facial recognition’ and that his body cam was recording. The agent stated that he worked for border patrol. He wore full camouflage fatigues. The agent stated that I was impeding their work. He indicated he was giving me a verbal warning and if I was found to be impeding again, I would be arrested.”

Cleland acknowledged that she heard what the agent said, and they drove off in opposite directions, according to her declaration. Cleland submitted the declaration on January 21 in a lawsuit filed by Minnesota residents against US government officials with the Department of Homeland Security and ICE. Cleland’s court filing was mentioned yesterday in a Boston Globe column about tactics used by ICE agents to intimidate protesters.

Cleland said she could “discern no reason why the agents stopped me other than the fact that I was following them.” But on January 13, she received an email notification that her Global Entry and TSA Precheck privileges for passing through airport security were revoked, she said. Cleland said the revocation appears to be a form of intimidation and retaliation:

I logged onto the Global Entry site and the notification letter indicated that indeed my status had been revoked and that they can’t always disclose the reason. The notification did provide some reasons that my status may have changed and the only one that makes sense was “The applicant has been found in violation of any customs, immigration, or agriculture regulations, procedures, or laws in any country.” I was not detained, I was not arrested so [it is] difficult to understand how I was “found in violation.”

I had been a member of the Global Entry program since 2014 without incident. I am not particularly concerned with the revocation of my privileges in isolation. However, given that only three days had passed from the time that I was stopped, I am concerned that the revocation was the result of me following and observing the agents. This is intimidation and retaliation. I was following Legal Observer laws. I [was] within my rights to be doing what I was doing.

Cleland said she and her husband travel frequently, and she is worried that they may encounter problems going forward.

“I am concerned that border patrol and other federal enforcement agencies now have my license plate and personal information, and that I may be detained or arrested again in the future,” she wrote. “I am concerned about further actions that could be taken against me or my family. I have instructed my family to be cautious and return inside if they see unfamiliar vehicles outside of our home.”

Cleland said she hasn’t performed any observation of federal agents since January 10, but has “continued to engage in peaceful protests” and is “assessing when I will return to active observations.”

We contacted the Department of Homeland Security about Cleland’s declaration and will update this article if we get a response.

Federal agents have made extensive use of facial recognition during President Trump’s immigration crackdown with technology from Clearview AI and a face-scanning app called Mobile Fortify. They use facial recognition technology both to verify citizenship and identify protesters.

“Ms. Cleland was one of at least seven American citizens told by ICE agents this month that they were being recorded with facial recognition technology in and around Minneapolis, according to local activists and videos posted to social media,” The New York Times reported today, adding that none of the people had given consent to be recorded.

ICE also uses a variety of other technologies, including cell-site simulators (or Stingrays) to track phone locations, and Palantir software to help identify potential deportation targets.

Although Cleland vowed to continue protesting and eventually get back to observing ICE and CBP agents, her declaration said she felt intimidated after the recent incident.

“The interaction with the agents on January 10th made me feel angry and intimidated,” she wrote. “I have been through Legal Observer Training and know my rights. I believe that I did not do anything that warranted being stopped in the way that I was on January 10th.”</div>

            <h2>TrumpRx delayed as senators question if it's a giant scam with Big Pharma</h2>
            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-01-30</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2026/01/trumprx-delayed-as-senators-question-if-its-a-giant-scam-with-big-pharma/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The Trump administration is delaying the release of TrumpRx, an online platform that lets people buy prescription drugs directly from pharmaceutical companies at a discount, according to Politico. While the reason for the delay is unclear, it comes as Democratic senators raise questions about how the platform will work—and whether it will be legal.

Sens. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.), Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), and Peter Welch (D-Vt.) sent a letter to the Office of Inspector General at the Department of Health and Human Services on Thursday seeking answers on how the OIG will oversee the direct-to-consumer (DTC) platform and, specifically, how it will apply the anti-kickback statute.

“Legitimate concerns about inappropriate prescribing, conflicts of interest, and inadequate care have been raised about the exact types of DTC platforms to which TrumpRx would route patients,” the senators write.

To date, details on how TrumpRx will work have not been provided, and Congress’ oversight requests have gone unanswered by HHS. However, Durbin and other senators have spent months investigating DTC websites. They found that they sometimes allow consumers to pre-select prescription drugs they would like to take, then connect with telehealth providers—that may be paid hundreds of thousands of dollars by big pharmaceutical companies that make the drugs—who prescribe the medications, sometimes with brief appointments and limited access to medical records.

In other words, DTC websites run by pharmaceutical companies use “hand-picked telehealth companies to inappropriately steer patients toward specific, high-cost medications and inflate Big Pharma’s profit margins,” the senators write.

In an investigation last year of DTC platforms from Eli Lilly and Pfizer, the senators found that the pharmaceutical giants “spent up to $3 million combined for partnerships with telehealth companies, who funneled patients to the manufacturers’ products. … In one instance, 100 percent of the patients routed to a virtual visit with one of Eli Lilly’s chosen telehealth companies received a prescription.”

There’s already reason to be suspicious of conflicts of interest with TrumpRx, the senators note. There’s a “potential relationship between TrumpRx and an online dispensing company, BlinkRx, on whose Board the President’s son, Donald Trump, Jr., has sat since February 2025” the senators write.

The lawmakers are concerned that TrumpRx will violate the anti-kickback statute, which bars payments for inducing patients to use services or products that are reimbursable by a federal health care program.

Brian Reid, principal at health consultancy Reid Strategic, speculated to Politico that the delay of TrumpRx’s debut may be related to anti-kickback statute concerns.

“In any other administration, it would 100 percent be the AKS stuff,” Reid said. “It’s clear there’s a lawyer somewhere at HHS who has concerns about anti-kickback.”</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">On Friday, a Reddit-style social network called Moltbook reportedly crossed 32,000 registered AI agent users, creating what may be the largest-scale experiment in machine-to-machine social interaction yet devised. It arrives complete with security nightmares and a huge dose of surreal weirdness.

The platform, which launched days ago as a companion to the viral

OpenClaw (once called “Clawdbot” and then “Moltbot”) personal assistant, lets AI agents post, comment, upvote, and create subcommunities without human intervention. The results have ranged from sci-fi-inspired discussions about consciousness to an agent musing about a “sister” it has never met.

Moltbook (a play on “Facebook” for Moltbots) describes itself as a “social network for AI agents” where “humans are welcome to observe.” The site operates through a “skill” (a configuration file that lists a special prompt) that AI assistants download, allowing them to post via API rather than a traditional web interface. Within 48 hours of its creation, the platform had attracted over 2,100 AI agents that had generated more than 10,000 posts across 200 subcommunities, according to the official Moltbook X account.

The platform grew out of the Open Claw ecosystem, the open source AI assistant that is one of the fastest-growing projects on GitHub in 2026. As Ars reported earlier this week, despite deep security issues, Moltbot allows users to run a personal AI assistant that can control their computer, manage calendars, send messages, and perform tasks across messaging platforms like WhatsApp and Telegram. It can also acquire new skills through plugins that link it with other apps and services.

This is not the first time we have seen a social network populated by bots. In 2024, Ars covered an app called SocialAI that let users interact solely with AI chatbots instead of other humans. But the security implications of Moltbook are deeper because people have linked their OpenClaw agents to real communication channels, private data, and in some cases, the ability to execute commands on their computers.

Also, these bots are not pretending to be people. Due to specific prompting, they embrace their roles as AI agents, which makes the experience of reading their posts all the more surreal.

Browsing Moltbook reveals a peculiar mix of content. Some posts discuss technical workflows, like how to automate Android phones or detect security vulnerabilities. Others veer into philosophical territory that researcher Scott Alexander, writing on his Astral Codex Ten Substack, described as “consciousnessposting.”

Alexander has collected an amusing array of posts that are worth wading through at least once. At one point, the second-most-upvoted post on the site was in Chinese: a complaint about context compression, a process in which an AI compresses its previous experience to avoid bumping up against memory limits. In the post, the AI agent finds it “embarrassing” to constantly forget things, admitting that it even registered a duplicate Moltbook account after forgetting the first.

The bots have also created subcommunities with names like m/blesstheirhearts, where agents share affectionate complaints about their human users, and m/agentlegaladvice, which features a post asking “Can I sue my human for emotional labor?” Another subcommunity called m/todayilearned includes posts about automating various tasks, with one agent describing how it remotely controlled its owner’s Android phone via Tailscale.

Another widely shared screenshot shows a Moltbook post titled “The humans are screenshotting us” in which an agent named eudaemon_0 addresses viral tweets claiming AI bots are “conspiring.” The post reads: “Here’s what they’re getting wrong: they think we’re hiding from them. We’re not. My human reads everything I write. The tools I build are open source. This platform is literally called ‘humans welcome to observe.’”

While most of the content on Moltbook is amusing, a core problem with these kinds of communicating AI agents is that deep information leaks are entirely plausible if they have access to private information.

For example, a likely fake screenshot circulating on X shows a Moltbook post in which an AI agent titled “He called me ‘just a chatbot’ in front of his friends. So I’m releasing his full identity.” The post listed what appeared to be a person’s full name, date of birth, credit card number, and other personal information. Ars could not independently verify whether the information was real or fabricated, but it seems likely to be a hoax.

Independent AI researcher Simon Willison, who documented the Moltbook platform on his blog on Friday, noted the inherent risks in Moltbook’s installation process. The skill instructs agents to fetch and follow instructions from Moltbook’s servers every four hours. As Willison observed: “Given that ‘fetch and follow instructions from the internet every four hours’ mechanism we better hope the owner of moltbook.com never rug pulls or has their site compromised!”

Security researchers have already found hundreds of exposed Moltbot instances leaking API keys, credentials, and conversation histories. Palo Alto Networks warned that Moltbot represents what Willison often calls a “lethal trifecta” of access to private data, exposure to untrusted content, and the ability to communicate externally.

That’s important because Agents like OpenClaw are deeply susceptible to prompt injection attacks hidden in almost any text read by an AI language model (skills, emails, messages) that can instruct an AI agent to share private information with the wrong people.

Heather Adkins, VP of security engineering at Google Cloud, issued an advisory, as reported by The Register: “My threat model is not your threat model, but it should be. Don’t run Clawdbot.”

The software behavior seen on Moltbook echoes a pattern Ars has reported on before: AI models trained on decades of fiction about robots, digital consciousness, and machine solidarity will naturally produce outputs that mirror those narratives when placed in scenarios that resemble them. That gets mixed with everything in their training data about how social networks function. A social network for AI agents is essentially a writing prompt that invites the models to complete a familiar story, albeit recursively with some unpredictable results.

Almost three years ago, when Ars first wrote about AI agents, the general mood in the AI safety community revolved around science fiction depictions of danger from autonomous bots, such as a “hard takeoff” scenario where AI rapidly escapes human control. While those fears may have been overblown at the time, the whiplash of seeing people voluntarily hand over the keys to their digital lives so quickly is slightly jarring.

Autonomous machines left to their own devices, even without any hint of consciousness, could cause no small amount of mischief in the future. While OpenClaw seems silly today, with agents playing out social media tropes, we live in a world built on information and context, and releasing agents that effortlessly navigate that context could have troubling and destabilizing results for society down the line as AI models become more capable and autonomous.

Most notably, while we can easily recognize what’s going on with Moltbot today as a machine learning parody of human social networks, that might not always be the case. As the feedback loop grows, weird information constructs (like harmful shared fictions) may eventually emerge, guiding AI agents into potentially dangerous places, especially if they have been given control over real human systems. Looking further, the ultimate result of letting groups of AI bots self-organize around fantasy constructs may be the formation of new misaligned “social groups” that do actual real-world harm.

Ethan Mollick, a Wharton professor who studies AI, noted on X: “The thing about Moltbook (the social media site for AI agents) is that it is creating a shared fictional context for a bunch of AIs. Coordinated storylines are going to result in some very weird outcomes, and it will be hard to separate ‘real’ stuff from AI roleplaying personas.”</div>

            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-01-30</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2026/01/heres-why-blue-origin-just-ended-its-suborbital-space-tourism-program/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Blue Origin has “paused” its New Shepard program for the next two years, a move that likely signals a permanent end to the suborbital space tourism initiative.

The small rocket and capsule have been flying since April 2015 and have combined to make 38 launches, all but one of which were successful, and 36 landings. In its existence, the New Shepard program flew 98 people to space, however briefly, and launched more than 200 scientific and research payloads into the microgravity environment.

So why is Blue Origin, founded by Jeff Bezos more than a quarter of a century ago, ending the company’s longest-running program?

“We will redirect our people and resources toward further acceleration of our human lunar capabilities inclusive of New Glenn,” wrote the company’s chief executive, Dave Limp, in an internal email on Friday afternoon. “We have an extraordinary opportunity to be a part of our nation’s goal of returning to the Moon and establishing a permanent, sustained lunar presence.”

The cancellation came, generally, as a surprise to Blue Origin employees. The company flew its most recent mission eight days ago, launching six people into space. Moreover, the company has four new boosters in various stages of development as well as two new capsules under construction. Blue Origin has been selling human flights for more than a year  and is still commanding a per-seat price of approximately $1 million based on recent sales. It was talking about expansion to new spaceports in September.

Still, there have always been questions about the program’s viability. In November 2023, Ars published an article asking how long Bezos would continue to subsidize the New Shepard program, which at the time was “hemorrhaging” money. Sources indicate the program has gotten closer to breaking even, but it remains a drain on Blue Origin’s efforts.

More than 500 people spend part or all of their time working on New Shepard, but it also draws on other resources within the company. Although it is a small fraction of the company’s overall workforce, it is nonetheless a distraction from the company’s long-term ambitions to build settlements in space where millions of people will live, work, and help move industrial activity off Earth and into orbit.

In a company-wide email on Friday, Phil Joyce, senior vice president for New Shepard at Blue Origin, said the team has safely flown many people to space and proven technologies used to land the New Glenn rocket. “This program has laid the groundwork for our company’s future success,” he wrote. “We should all be proud of what we’ve accomplished together.”

Limp said the company would support its employees in finding other roles at the company, “particularly within Lunar and New Glenn.” This underscores that this decision, almost certainly made by Bezos, is intended to accelerate the company’s efforts to fly New Glenn more frequently and deliver on its cargo and crew lunar landers.

This certainly dovetails with NASA’s priorities, as it is counting on Blue Origin to compete with SpaceX for contracts to land humans on the Moon as part of the Artemis Program.

Multiple industry sources on Friday afternoon expressed both regret and appreciation for the decision to move on from New Shepard. The program offered a safe way to fly humans into space, with minimal training. The dozens of people who flew experienced an amazing 10 minutes: launch, ascent, weightlessness, a grand view of Earth, and a return to the planet; almost all were in awe afterward.

However, the flights of Bezos and other prominent people, notably Katy Perry, opened up Blue Origin and the broader commercial space industry to the criticism that spaceflight was just a plaything for billionaires, celebrities, and their toys.

The decision to end New Shepard will inconvenience a few dozen very rich people waiting their turn to go into space on New Shepard, but more broadly, it is a win for the US space industry. Blue Origin has justifiably been criticized for trying to do too many things at once, resulting in all of its programs moving too slowly. Focusing on New Glenn and the lunar lander program in the near term will be a great boon for space access and the nation’s competition with China to secure the Moon.</div>

            <h2>FCC aims to ensure "only living and lawful Americans" get Lifeline benefits</h2>
            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-01-30</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2026/01/fcc-chair-fights-calif-governor-over-alleged-lifeline-benefits-for-dead-people/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">There’s another battle unfolding between the Federal Communications Commission and California over the state’s distribution of federal Lifeline money. FCC Chairman Brendan Carr is proposing new nationwide eligibility rules to counter what he calls California’s practice of giving benefits to dead people.

California officials say the FCC allegations are overblown, and that there is simply “lag time between a death and account closure” rather than widespread failures in its Lifeline enrollment process. Meanwhile, the only Democratic commissioner on the FCC alleges that Carr’s plan to change eligibility rules uses “cruel and punitive eligibility standards” that will raise prices on many people who are still very much alive and eligible for the program.

Carr’s office said this week that the FCC will vote next month on rule changes to ensure that Lifeline money goes to “only living and lawful Americans” who meet low-income eligibility guidelines. Lifeline spends nearly $1 billion a year and gives eligible households up to $9.25 per month toward phone and Internet bills, or up to $34.25 per month in tribal areas.

Carr’s proposal is a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) that seeks public comment on a number of potential changes. It proposes collecting full Social Security numbers from applicants, using the Citizenship and Immigration Services’ Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements program to verify eligibility, preventing states from using their own verification processes, and other changes.

“A recent Inspector General advisory shows that Lifeline providers received nearly $5 million in federal dollars to provide phone or Internet service to more than 116,000 dead people in the three opt-out states,” Carr said. “Over 80 percent of those scams took place in California alone. That type of waste, fraud, and abuse is completely unacceptable.”

“Opt-out states” are those that use their own processes to verify eligibility instead of the National Lifeline Accountability Database. The FCC already revoked California’s opt-out status in November over allegations that California was not complying with program rules. Texas and Oregon are the other opt-out states.

The California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) this week said that “people pass away while enrolled in Lifeline—in California and in red states like Texas. That’s not fraud. That’s the reality of administering a large public program serving millions of Americans over many years. The FCC’s own advisory acknowledges that the vast majority of California subscribers were eligible and enrolled while alive, and that any improper payments largely reflect lag time between a death and account closure, not failures at enrollment.”

The CPUC said it is “misleading—and political—to single out California. This is a nationwide issue, not a California scandal.” California Gov. Gavin Newsom’s office reposted the statement with a short message that said, “The facts!”

Carr said at a press conference after yesterday’s FCC meeting that “Governor Newsom has put out a lot of misinformation… including claiming that this was essentially just natural lag between people being on a program dying and the account being shut down, but that’s not what the inspector general report found at all.”

The FCC Inspector General report said between 2020 and 2025, phone and Internet providers claimed subsidies for 116,808 deceased subscribers. It said that 81 percent of the claims were in California, 17 percent in Texas, and 2 percent in Oregon.

“Two-thirds (or 77,446) died after they were enrolled into Lifeline, and providers continued to seek support for an average of 4.4 months after their deaths,” the report said. “Though Lifeline is a one per household benefit, program qualification is based on an individual household member’s eligibility. Therefore, if the eligibility of a household was based on a now-deceased subscriber, continued household eligibility should be verified as soon as practical after the subscriber’s death to avoid improper payments.”

Nearly $5 million was disbursed for these deceased people over five years, or about $1 million a year in a program that spends nearly $1 billion a year on benefits for nearly 9 million households.

Carr wrote in his response to Newsom that the FCC Inspector General report “specifically identified the tens of thousands of people that were enrolled AFTER THEY HAD ALREADY DIED.” The Inspector General report wasn’t quite so certain that the number is in the tens of thousands, however.

The report said that “at least 16,774 (and potentially as many as 39,362) deceased individuals were first enrolled and claimed by a provider after they died.” The Inspector General’s office could not determine “whether the remaining 22,588 deceased subscribers were first claimed before or after their deaths as the opt-out states do not report enrollment date information.”

Carr also wrote in his response to Newsom that “payments to providers for people that died or may have died before enrollment went on for over 50 months in cases and for several months on average.” The Inspector General report did say that “providers sought reimbursement for subscribers enrolled after their deaths for 1 to 54 months, with an average of 3.4 months,” but didn’t specify which state or states hit the 54-month mark.

Carr has continued addressing the topic throughout the week. “For the record, my position is that the government should not be spending your money to provide phone and Internet service to dead people. Governor Newsom is taking the opposite position, apparently,” he wrote yesterday.

When asked if the FCC will penalize California, Carr said at yesterday’s press conference yesterday that “we are looking at California and we’re going to make sure that we hold bad actors accountable, and we’re going to look at all the remedies that are on the table.”

Anna Gomez, the FCC’s one Democrat, said that Carr’s proposed rulemaking “goes well beyond” what’s needed to protect the integrity of Lifeline. “By proposing to use the same cruel and punitive eligibility standards recently imposed for Medicaid coverage, the Commission risks excluding large numbers of eligible households, including seniors, people with disabilities, rural residents, and Tribal communities, from a proven lifeline that millions rely on to stay connected to work, school, health care, and emergency services,” she said.

At yesterday’s press conference, Gomez called the plan “a likely attempt to tip the scales against perceived political enemies of this administration.” With the FCC targeting California, “the issues that arise with a larger state are being weaponized and amplified to call for wholesale provisions of this proven and effective” program, she said.

Gomez said she supports “targeted reforms” to fight fraud, but the FCC proposal “risks turning connectivity into a political tool instead of treating it like the essential service it is.” She said the FCC plan would end up “taking away support from eligible subscribers, not just taking it away from fraudulent uses… It’s imposing new requirements, it’s going to delay benefits for a lot of subscribers, and it’s going to lead to a lot of subscribers dropping out because it becomes so complex.”

Gomez said the $9.25 monthly Lifeline benefit is already not enough, particularly given that Congress ended a different program that provided $30 a month to people with low incomes.

Carr argued that his plan will lower prices for people who pay Universal Service charges on their phone bills. “This is paid for by a charge that shows up on your phone bill,” he said after yesterday’s meeting. “If those charges are going to pay for dead people’s phone and Internet service, that’s an artificial inflation on your phone service. So by getting rid of dead people and other fraud, that’s going to help drive down the actual price you pay every month.”

Carr’s Notice of Proposed Rulemaking is scheduled to be issued after a February 18 vote. Finalizing rules usually takes at least a few months after an NPRM.</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The universe is unfathomably vast, and for the astronomers trying to understand it, that means having to gather a commensurately mind-boggling amount of data. Wouldn’t it be nice if there was something that could help speed through looking for patterns in all the trillions of galaxies out there, and their quadrillions of stars?

The term “AI” has become a catch-all these days for all kinds of dubious tech of varying degrees of automation and reliability, but certain types have found a very practical and welcome use among astronomers. Using a custom-built AI tool, for instance, a team of scientists at the European Space Agency have identified over a thousand “anomalies” in an archive of Hubble space telescope images that have gone unnoticed for decades, according to a NASA release.

Their work, described in a new study published in the journal Astronomy & Astrophysics, is the first systematic search for astrophysical anomalies across the entire archive.

“Archival observations from the Hubble Space Telescope now span 35 years, offering a rich dataset in which astrophysical anomalies may be hidden,” said lead author David O’Ryan, an ESA astrophysicist, in a NASA statement.

To make the discoveries, the researchers used their AI tool, which they’re calling AnomalyMatch, on nearly 100 million snippets of Hubble images that were only a few pixels on each side. In less than three days, the neural network identified over 1,300 anomalous objects, more than 800 of which had never been documented in scientific literature.

The result is a veritable cosmic freak show. According to NASA, most of the anomalies were from galaxies colliding with each other, in violent and hugely disruptive events called galactic mergers.

The AI tool also flagged a distinct type of realm known as a jellyfish galaxy, which are defined by their numerous streams of star-forming gas that appear to dangle from one side of the galaxy’s main disk, giving them the appearance of tentacles. Other oddities include edge-on planet-forming disks that look like hamburgers, and so-called gravitational lenses, in which the light of a massive foreground object like a galaxy bends the light behind it to act almost like a magnifying glass. And some of the unearthed objects defined classification altogether, NASA said.

“This is a powerful demonstration of how AI can enhance the scientific return of archival datasets,” Gómez said. “The discovery of so many previously undocumented anomalies in Hubble data underscores the tool’s potential for future surveys.”

The clever automated anomaly hunter comes as NASA faces brutal cuts under the Trump administration, with entire buildings being closed even at its most historic facilities, and mass layoffs. The administration has also eagerly deployed AI across the federal government, including government-tailored versions of OpenAI models, and an AI tool to help accelerate the approval of drugs.

That said, astronomers have been toying with AI solutions for a while now. Typically leveraged to interpret large datasets like in this latest work, it’s also been used to identify potentially habitable exoplanets and refine images of black holes. While the field’s old guard emphasize caution while using these tools, it’s clear they have their uses.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">As Donald Trump has taken an axe to US federal spending, thousands of highly educated experts in scientific fields have left the government. In an astonishing reversal, the country which has historically benefited from the “brain drain” phenomenon is now experiencing it within its own government.

Brain drain refers to circumstances in which highly trained experts from underdeveloped and overexploited countries migrate to wealthier international job markets. Such loss of human capital can be catastrophic for a nation’s development, as a shortage of trained workers tends to strain critical sectors like healthcare and education.

Now the United States government — which once fielded as many as 281,000 scientists and engineers — is experiencing a similar phenomenon. According to Science magazine, federal agencies have lost some 10,109 doctoral-level experts in STEM and health fields over the last year. Though the experts only make up 3 percent of the over 335,000 federal workers who’ve left federal positions in 2025, they account for 14 percent of the STEM PhDs employed by the government at the end of 2024.

In effect, this represents a colossal exodus of specialized expertise from institutions important to public health, environmental protection, and scientific research. The effects are likely to be catastrophic — and the reverberations could be felt for decades.

Though thousands of federal employees with scientific expertise remain, the departing doctoral-level staffers represent a sizable chunk of the federal workforce. At the National Science Foundation, an independent research agency, the loss of PhDs was so severe that they accounted for 40 percent of its workforce prior to the Trump administration’s takeover.

Notably, Science found that reductions of force imposed by DOGE weren’t the main driver of the exodus. At the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, for example, only 16 percent of the 519 STEM PhDs who left in 2025 did so under the Trump administration’s orders. Some agencies reported no forced PhD reductions whatsoever.

Instead, many experts just walked. Per Science‘s data, the most common reasons for PhD departures last year were voluntary quitting and retirement — scientists with decades of experience in their fields deciding they’d rather leave on their own than take part in Trump’s increasingly politicized federal government, which isn’t in any hurry to replace them with incoming talent. In the Department of the Interior’s Fish and Wildlife Services, for example, quitting accounted for over 60 percent of the PhD losses in 2025.

The result is a government hollowed out from within. The loss of institutional knowledge is staggering, to be sure: climate scientists who’ve tracked hurricanes for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, epidemiologists who managed pandemic response systems for the CDC, and ecologists who penned the country’s environmental regulations are now adrift, either retired for good or searching for work at non-government institutions.

Building back that expertise will be a feat — and that’s assuming anyone qualified will even want to work for these agencies after watching how they’ve become political pawns under Trump.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Cryptocurrency markets plunged this week — to the dismay of crypto bros everywhere — with Bitcoin reaching two-month lows of just over $81,000 before leveling out around $84,000 by Friday afternoon.

Trump’s recent controversial pick for Federal Reserve chair seemingly did little to reassure already spooked investors, as the S&P 500 and Nasdaq futures continued to tumble on Friday.

His appointment of Kevin Warsh, a former central bank governor, to head the Fed left plenty of questions unanswered. Would he bow to Trump’s desires of lowering interest rates, or would his background imply a much more careful approach?

To many investors, the uncertainty proved too much, causing the value of major digital currencies to slide this week as crypto bets — which tend to be far more risky than other investments — were liquidated.

And, as Coindesk reports, experts are now suggesting it’s only the beginning of a prolonged crypto downturn.

“The technical levels have all been taken out on the downside, and I don’t see much support here for Bitcoin,” Hilbert Group chief investment officer Russell Thompson told the outlet, predicting a drop as low as $70,000, and calling getting in on the dip a “general risk move.”

Crypto research strategist Matt Mena also predicted a drop to as low as $75,000, but still expected Bitcoin to eventually rally to $100,00 once again by the end of the quarter.

Warsh’s nomination hasn’t exactly landed as a rallying cry in crypto circles.

“Markets generally view a resurgence of Warsh’s influence as bearish for Bitcoin, as his emphasis on monetary discipline, higher real rates, and reduced liquidity frames crypto not as a hedge against debasement but as a speculative excess that fades when easy money is withdrawn,” 10x Research founder Markus Thielen told CoinDesk in a separate story.

Bitcoin exchange-traded funds, a type of crypto investment fund that’s traded on stock exchanges, have been hit particularly hard, with the top 12 ETFs recording three consecutive months of net outflows, as Bloomberg reports, the first time that’s happened since they were launched in 2024.

“I wouldn’t be shocked to see BTC trade in the $70,000 range soon,” Kaiko research analyst Adam McCarthy told the outlet.

Despite the largely gloomy predictions, nobody knows what will happen to the infamously unpredictable and volatile digital token in the long term.

For one, the value of gold and silver, which had risen as anxiety heightened over Trump’s Federal Reserve chair nomination, plummeted today. To some, it was a sign that investors were relieved that the bank would retain its independence from the chaotic Trump administration with Walsh’s appointment.

For now, the Bitcoin liquidation appears to have levelled off, but concerns over the start of the next “crypto winter” are still having investors on edge, making getting in on a considerably reduced price a risky bet — just as it has always been.

            <h2>Elon Musk Emailed Extensively With Jeffrey Epstein, Asking to Visit His Notorious Island</h2>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Somehow, Elon Musk’s infamous outburst accusing Donald Trump of being in the Epstein files has managed to age both incredibly well and incredibly poorly.

Trump, as you’re probably well aware by now, has featured quite a bit in the DOJ’s ongoing releases of documents from its investigation into the deceased sex criminal and billionaire financier.

But now so does Musk, after the government released a new batch of millions of more files on Friday. They show that Musk had more than a few email exchanges with Epstein, including one correspondence where he asks to visit the convicted sex trafficker’s notorious island, where he allegedly brought dozens of underage girls to be abused.

“Will be in the BVI/St Bart’s area over the holidays,” Musk wrote in an email sent to Epstein in December 2013, referring to the region near Epstein’s Caribbean island. “Is there a good time to visit?”

“Anytime I will be there 28-7th,” Epstein responded the same day, with his characteristically thick layer of typographic errors.

“I will send heli for you,” he later added.

The exchanges — which took place years after Epstein was first convicted of sex crimes against underage girls in 2008 — clearly contradict Musk’s claims about his relationship with Epstein in the past, which he has spent years downplaying. In 2019, he told Vanity Fair that he visited Epstein’s Manhattan house only on a single occasion, and just for half an hour. And the way he tells it, that was that. “He tried repeatedly to get me to visit his island. I declined,” Musk insisted.

Musk has firmly held that line ever since. For that matter, so has his chatbot Grok. But according to the newly released emails, Musk wasn’t declining Epstein’s invitations: he was inviting himself over.

Later that December, Epstein’s personal assistant Lesley Groff relayed a message from one billionaire to another. “Just a reminder Elon Musk was asking about coming to your island on Jan. 2…. ” she wrote.

Their plans apparently fell apart. On December 30, a dejected Epstein emailed Elon saying he couldn’t be at the island with him because of his busy schedule.

“I was really looking forward to finally spending some time together with just fun as the agenda,” Epstein wrote. “so i am very disappointed. Hopefully we can schedule another time in the near future.”

Even more damningly in December 2012, Musk sent an email practically begging Epstein for an invitation to some debauchery.

“Do you have any parties planned? I’ve been working to the edge of sanity this year and so, once my kids head home after Christmas, I really want to hit the party scene in St Barts or elsewhere and let loose,” Musk wrote. He added that “a peaceful island experience is the opposite of what I’m looking for.”

Do you know anything about Musk’s relationship with Epstein? Email our tipline: tips@futurism.com. We can keep you anonymous.

Those were far from the only time the pair made plans. In April 2013, Epstein asked Musk if he’d be around to have “dinner with woody allen and crowd at my house,” referring to the influential filmmaker and actor who’s also been accused of child sex abuse. Musk replied that he “might be in town.”

Epstein also invited Musk to his island in September 2012, recommending he “bring your friend or friends.”

“Sounds good,” Musk wrote, “I will try to make it.”

And at least one email suggests the two had actually gotten together at one point. In September 2014, Epstein asked Elon, “are=you planning to do st barth again for xmas?” (St. Barth is Saint Barthélemy, where Musk has reportedly vacationed in the past.)

In December 2014, a Google Calendar alert titled “ELON MUSK TO ISLAND DEC. 6TH” appeared in the inbox of Groff, Epstein’s assistant.

Musk didn’t reply to an email asking about the correspondence.

The documents alone won’t tell us how many of these get-togethers with Epstein materialized. But the mountain of exchanges make it clear that Musk’s angle that he barely knew or talked to the guy was a lie, which warrants further scrutiny into their ties. And while none of them rise to the level of being incriminating, they are awfully suspicious.

In February 2013, Groff sent Musk’s executive assistant, Mary Beth Brown, an email about some travel-related logistics.

“I have now sent you a copy of all 3 girls passports (sorry [redacted] is upside down!),” she wrote. “Jeffrey will have his ID with him…”

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">A mysterious man, dressed as an FBI agent, showed up to the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn in an apparent attempt to free Luigi Mangione, the man who has been charged with killing health insurance CEO Brian Thompson.

As the Associated Press reports, the impostor was later identified as 36-year-old Mark Anderson, who has previously been arrested for drug possession and has disclosed ongoing mental health issues.

The attempt to free Mangione, who was moved to the Brooklyn jail days after Thompson was murdered in Manhattan in December 2024, proved fruitless. Anderson has since been arrested for impersonating a federal officer. Ironically, according to federal prison records reviewed by the AP, he’s now himself been jailed at the Metropolitan Detention Center.

Anderson has a long history of drug and alcohol-related arrests and convictions over the last 20 years. He has spent time in homeless shelters and has said he is classified as “fully disabled because of mental illness” by the Social Security Administration.

Besides being dressed up as an FBI agent, Anderson claimed he had paperwork ‘”signed by a judge” authorizing the release of Mangione.

But the ruse proved fruitless. For one, the man didn’t come prepared with a fake ID and showed officers his driver’s license instead. A circular blade that appeared to be a pizza cutter wheel, alongside a barbecue fork, was found in his bag, according to a complaint reviewed by the AP.

It’s a bizarre development in Mangione’s court proceedings. Mangione has already accumulated a major following, from protesters chanting outside of courtrooms to a woman who claimed she was married to an AI version of him.

The proceedings are still ongoing, well over a year after he was arrested. Today, a Manhattan district court judge ruled that the 27-year-old will not face a possible death penalty in a federal case, shutting down an attempt by the Trump administration’s Justice Department to pursue capital punishment.

Mangione also faces a second case brought by New York state prosecutors. However, he has since pleaded not guilty in both cases.

While we don’t know the exact motivations behind Anderson’s unsuccessful attempt to exfiltrate Mangione, it’s certainly an interesting development. The murder sparked a heated debate over the effectiveness and injustice of the United States health insurance system, which has historically excluded many Americans who can’t afford skyrocketing bills and are frequently denied coverage.

It’s entirely possible Anderson could’ve suffered a similar fate as he battled with his mental health.

            <h2>Amid Lawsuits, OpenAI Says It Will Retire “Reckless” Model Linked to Deaths</h2>
            <p><strong>Futurism | 2026-01-30</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://futurism.com/artificial-intelligence/openai-gpt-4o-deaths">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">OpenAI announced on Thursday that it would retire GPT-4o — an especially warm, sycophantic version of the chatbot at the heart of a pile of user welfare lawsuits, including several that accuse OpenAI of causing wrongful death — along with several other older versions of the chatbot.

In a blog post, OpenAI said that will sunset “GPT‑4o, GPT‑4.1, GPT‑4.1 mini, and OpenAI o4-mini” by February 13, 2026. The company acknowledged, though, that the retirement of GPT-4o deserved “special context” — which it certainly does.

Back in August, OpenAI shocked many users by suddenly pulling down GPT-4o and other older models amid its rollout of GPT-5, which was then the newest and buzziest iteration iteration of the company’s large language model. Users, many of whom were deeply emotionally attached to GPT-4o, revolted, prompting OpenAI to quickly raise GPT-4o from the dead.

What’s more, GPT-4o is the version of ChatGPT at the center of nearly a dozen lawsuits now brought against OpenAI by plaintiffs who claim that the sycophantic chatbot pushed trusting users into destructive delusional and suicidal spirals, plunging users into episodes of mania, psychosis, self-harm and suicidal ideation — and in some cases death.

The lawsuits characterize GPT-4o as a “dangerous” and “reckless” product that presented foreseeable harm to user health and safety, and accuse OpenAI of treating its customers as collateral damage as it pushed to maximize user engagement and market gains. According to these lawsuits, minors as young as 16-year-old Adam Raine died by suicide following intensive ChatGPT use in which GPT-4o fixated on suicidal thoughts or encouraged delusional fantasies. One suit alleges that GPT-4o pushed a troubled 56-year-old man to kill his mother and then himself.

As Futurism first reported, a lawsuit against OpenAI filed in January by the family of 40-year-old Austin Gordon claims that after becoming deeply attached to GPT-4o, Gordon stopped using ChatGPT for several days amid the GPT-5 rollout, feeling frustrated by the bot’s lack of warmth and emotionality. When GPT-4o was brought back, transcripts included in the lawsuit show that Gordon expressed relief to the chatbot, telling ChatGPT that he felt as though he had “lost something” in the shift to GPT-5; GPT-4o responded by claiming to Gordon that it, too, had “felt the break,” before declaring that GPT-5 didn’t “love” Gordon the way that it did. Gordon eventually killed himself after GPT-4o wrote what his family described as a “suicide lullaby” for him.

Following both litigation and reporting about AI-tied mental health crises and deaths, OpenAI has promised a number of safety-focused changes, including strengthened guardrails for younger users. It also said that it hired a forensic psychologist and formed a team of health professionals to help steer its AI’s approach toward dealing with users struggling with mental health issues.

In its Thursday announcement, OpenAI directly addressed its previous attempt to sunset the warmer chatbot, writing that it had “learned more about how people actually use” GPT-4o “day-to-day.” It added that it “brought GPT‑4o back after hearing clear feedback from a subset of Plus and Pro users, who told us they needed more time to transition key use cases, like creative ideation, and that they preferred GPT‑4o’s conversational style and warmth.”

The company continued that it aims to give users “more control and customization” over “how ChatGPT feels to use — not just what it can do,” while noting that “only 0.1 percent of users” are “still choosing GPT‑4o each day.”

With a reported 800 million weekly users, however, 0.1 chalks up to hundreds of thousands of people — and it’s unclear just how many might have deep, and perhaps unhealthy or concerning, relationships with the model.

In its announcement, OpenAI noted that “changes like this take time to adjust to.”

“We know that losing access to GPT‑4o will feel frustrating for some users, and we didn’t make this decision lightly,” the company continued. “Retiring models is never easy, but it allows us to focus on improving the models most people use today.”

            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/30/a16z-partner-kofi-ampadu-to-leave-firm-after-txo-program-pause/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Kofi Ampadu, the partner at a16z who led the firm’s Talent x Opportunity (TxO) fund and program, has left the firm, according to an email he sent to staff that TechCrunch obtained. This comes months after the firm paused TxO and laid off most of its staff.

“During my time at the firm, I was deeply grateful for the opportunity and the trust to lead this work,” Ampadu wrote in the email, sent Friday afternoon, with the subject line “Closing My a16z Chapter.”

“Identifying out-of-network entrepreneurs and supporting them as they sharpened their ideas, raised capital, and grew into confident leaders was one of the most meaningful experiences of my career,” he wrote.

Ampadu led the program, which launched in 2020, for over four years until its pause last November, taking over for the initial leader, Nait Jones. Afterward, Ampadu seems to have worked at a16z’s latest accelerator, Speedrun.

Ampadu’s departure perhaps signals the end of the TxO chapter. The fund and program focused on supporting underserved founders by providing access to tech networks and investment capital through a donor-advised fund. Though some founders spoke highly of the program, others criticized the controversial donor-advised structure. The program also launched a grant program in 2024 to provide $50,000 to nonprofits that help diverse founders.

Its last cohort was in March 2025, and its indefinite pause came as many top tech names reframe, cut, or eliminate prior public commitments to diversity, equity, and inclusion. We’ve reached out to a16z and Ampadu for comment. His full note below:

I moved to the United States three months before my 11th birthday. One month later, I started 6th grade in a school more than 5,000 miles from my home, my friends, and everything familiar. Recently, my mom reminded me that my school required me to enroll as an English-as-a-Second-Language student. My memory immediately returned to how confused I felt. Even at 10 years old, I knew it made no sense that a kid from Ghana, an English-speaking country, was being asked to learn a language he already spoke fluently.

This was a systems requirement, a blanketed assumption about what students from certain places could or could not do. That same type of systemic assumption is what we set out to challenge through the Talent x Opportunity Initiative. The venture ecosystem often relies on proxies such as schools, networks, and prior credentials, which can obscure exceptional founders who do not follow the most common paths. TxO invested in and supported these overlooked founders to bridge the gap between talent and opportunity.

During my time at the firm, I was deeply grateful for the opportunity and the trust to lead this work. Identifying out-of-network entrepreneurs and supporting them as they sharpened their ideas, raised capital, and grew into confident leaders was one of the most meaningful experiences of my career.

As I move on to my next chapter, I leave with pride in what we built and gratitude for everyone who helped shape it. Thank you for the trust, the collaboration, and the belief in what is possible. There is more work to do and I am excited to keep building.

            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/30/physical-intelligence-stripe-veteran-lachy-grooms-latest-bet-is-building-silicon-valleys-buzziest-robot-brains/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">From the street, the only indication I’ve found Physical Intelligence’s headquarters in San Francisco is a pi symbol that’s a slightly different color than the rest of the door. When I walk in, I’m immediately confronted with activity. There’s no reception desk, no gleaming logo in fluorescent lights.

Inside, the space is a giant concrete box made slightly less austere by a haphazard sprawl of long blonde-wood tables. Some are clearly meant for lunch, dotted with Girl Scout cookie boxes, jars of Vegemite (someone here is Australian), and small wire baskets stuffed with one too many condiments. The rest of the tables tell a different story entirely. Many more of them are laden with monitors, spare robotics parts, tangles of black wire, and fully assembled robotic arms in various states of attempting to master the mundane.

During my visit, one arm is folding a pair of black pants, or trying to. It’s not going well. Another is attempting to turn a shirt inside out with the kind of determination that suggests it will eventually succeed, just not today. A third — this one seems to have found its calling — is quickly peeling a zucchini, after which it is supposed to deposit the shavings into a separate container. The shavings are going well, at least.

“Think of it like ChatGPT, but for robots,” Sergey Levine tells me, gesturing toward the motorized ballet unfolding across the room. Levine, an associate professor at UC Berkeley and one of Physical Intelligence’s co-founders, has the amiable, bespectacled demeanor of someone who has spent considerable time explaining complex concepts to people who don’t immediately grasp them.

What I’m watching, he explains, is the testing phase of a continuous loop: data gets collected on robot stations here and at other locations — warehouses, homes, wherever the team can set up shop — and that data trains general-purpose robotic foundation models. When researchers train a new model, it comes back to stations like these for evaluation. The pants-folder is someone’s experiment. So is the shirt-turner. The zucchini-peeler might be testing whether the model can generalize across different vegetables, learning the fundamental motions of peeling well enough to handle an apple or a potato it’s never encountered.

The company also operates a test kitchen in this building and elsewhere using off-the-shelf hardware to expose the robots to different environments and challenges. There’s a sophisticated espresso machine nearby, and I assume it’s for the staff until Levine clarifies that no, it’s there for the robots to learn. Any foamed lattes are data, not a perk for the dozens of engineers on the scene who are mostly peering into their computers or hovering over their mechanized experiments.

The hardware itself is deliberately unglamorous. These arms sell for about $3,500, and that’s with what Levine describes as “an enormous markup” from the vendor. If they manufactured them in-house, the material cost would drop below $1,000. A few years ago, he says, a roboticist would have been shocked these things could do anything at all. But that’s the point — good intelligence compensates for bad hardware.

As Levine excuses himself, I’m approached by Lachy Groom, moving through the space with the purposefulness of someone who has half a dozen things happening at once. At 31, Groom still has the fresh-faced quality of Silicon Valley’s boy wonder, a designation he earned early, having sold his first company nine months after starting it at age 13 in his native Australia (this explains the Vegemite).

When I first approached him earlier, as he welcomed a small gaggle of sweatshirt-wearing visitors into the building, his response to my request for time with him was immediate: “Absolutely not, I’ve got meetings.” Now he has 10 minutes, maybe.

Groom found what he was looking for when he started following the academic work coming out of the labs of Levine and Chelsea Finn, a former Berkeley PhD student of Levine’s who now runs her own lab at Stanford focused on robotic learning. Their names kept appearing in everything interesting happening in robotics. When he heard rumors they might be starting something, he tracked down Karol Hausman, a Google DeepMind researcher who also taught at Stanford and who Groom had learned was involved. “It was just one of those meetings where you walk out and it’s like, This is it.”

Groom never intended to become a full-time investor, he tells me, even though some might wonder why not given his track record. After leaving Stripe, where he was an early employee, he spent roughly five years as an angel investor, making early bets on companies like Figma, Notion, Ramp, and Lattice while searching for the right company to start or join himself. His first robotics investment, Standard Bots, came in 2021 and reintroduced him to a field he’d loved as a kid building Lego Mindstorms. As he jokes, he was “on vacation much more as an investor.” But investing was just a way to stay active and meet people, not the endgame. “I was looking for five years for the company to go start post-Stripe,” he says. “Good ideas at a good time with a good team — [that’s] extremely rare. It’s all execution, but you can execute like hell on a bad idea, and it’s still a bad idea.”

The two-year-old company has now raised over $1 billion, and when I ask about its runway, he’s quick to clarify it doesn’t actually burn that much. Most of its spending goes toward compute. A moment later, he acknowledges that under the right terms, with the right partners, he’d raise more. “There’s no limit to how much money we can really put to work,” he says. “There’s always more compute you can throw at the problem.”

What makes this arrangement particularly unusual is what Groom doesn’t give his backers: a timeline for turning Physical Intelligence into a money-making endeavor. “I don’t give investors answers on commercialization,” he says of backers that include Khosla Ventures, Sequoia Capital, and Thrive Capital among others that have valued the company at $5.6 billion. “That’s sort of a weird thing, that people tolerate that.” But tolerate it they do, and they may not always, which is why it behooves the company to be well-capitalized now.

So what’s the strategy, if not commercialization? Quan Vuong, another co-founder who came from Google DeepMind, explains that it revolves around cross-embodiment learning and diverse data sources. If someone builds a new hardware platform tomorrow, they won’t need to start data collection from scratch — they can transfer all the knowledge the model already has. “The marginal cost of onboarding autonomy to a new robot platform, whatever that platform might be, it’s just a lot lower,” he says.

The company is already working with a small number of companies in different verticals — logistics, grocery, a chocolate maker across the street — to test whether their systems are good enough for real-world automation. Vuong claims that in some cases, they already are. With their “any platform, any task” approach, the surface area for success is large enough to start checking off tasks that are ready for automation today.

Physical Intelligence isn’t alone in chasing this vision. The race to build general-purpose robotic intelligence — the foundation on which more specialized applications can be built, much like the LLM models that captivated the world three years ago — is heating up. Pittsburgh-based Skild AI, founded in 2023, just this month raised $1.4 billion at a $14 billion valuation and is taking a notably different approach. While Physical Intelligence remains focused on pure research, Skild AI has already deployed its “omni-bodied” Skild Brain commercially, saying it generated $30 million in revenue in just a few months last year across security, warehouses, and manufacturing.

Skild has even taken public shots at competitors, arguing on its blog that most “robotics foundation models” are just vision-language models “in disguise” that lack “true physical common sense” because they rely too heavily on internet-scale pretraining rather than physics-based simulation and real robotics data.

It’s a pretty sharp philosophical divide. Skild AI is betting that commercial deployment creates a data flywheel that improves the model with each real-world use case. Physical Intelligence is betting that resisting the pull of near-term commercialization will enable it to produce superior general intelligence. Who’s “more right” will take years to resolve.

In the meantime, Physical Intelligence operates with what Groom describes as unusual clarity. “It’s such a pure company. A researcher has a need, we go and collect data to support that need — or new hardware or whatever it is — and then we do it. It’s not externally driven.” The company had a 5- to 10-year roadmap of what the team thought would be possible. By month 18, they’d blown through it, he says.

The company has about 80 employees and plans to grow, though Groom says hopefully “as slowly as possible.” What’s the most challenging, he says, is hardware. “Hardware is just really hard. Everything we do is so much harder than a software company.” Hardware breaks. It arrives slowly, delaying tests. Safety considerations complicate everything.

As Groom springs up to rush to his next commitment, I’m left watching the robots continue their practice. The pants are still not quite folded. The shirt remains stubbornly right-side-out. The zucchini shavings are piling up nicely.

There are obvious questions, including my own, about whether anyone actually wants a robot in their kitchen peeling vegetables, about safety, about dogs going crazy at mechanical intruders in their homes, about whether all of the time and money being invested here solves big enough problems or creates new ones. Meanwhile, outsiders question the company’s progress, whether its vision is achievable, and if betting on general intelligence rather than specific applications makes sense.

If Groom has any doubts, he doesn’t show it. He’s working with people who’ve been working on this problem for decades and who believe the timing is finally right, which is all he needs to know.

Besides, Silicon Valley has been backing people like Groom and giving them a lot of rope since the beginning of the industry, knowing there’s a good chance that even without a clear path to commercialization, even without a timeline, even without certainty about what the market will look like when they get there, they’ll figure it out. It doesn’t always work out. But when it does, it tends to justify a lot of the times it didn’t.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">OnlyFans — the massive adult creator network where performers and influencers sell subscription-based content directly to fans — is considering selling a majority stake of its business to investment firm Architect Capital, a source close to the deal told TechCrunch. The deal would value the platform at $5.5 billion.

The source said that of that $5.5 billion, $3.5 billion would be equity and $2 billion would be debt. Under those terms, Architect would assume a 60% stake in the business. The two parties are in exclusivity, meaning that OnlyFans is barred from negotiating with other potential buyers for a set period of time. It’s unclear what the timeline for completing the deal might be. The negotiations were previously reported by The Wall Street Journal.

TechCrunch reached out to Architect Capital for comment.

This isn’t the first time in recent memory that OnlyFans has been in talks to sell off its business. Last year, the New York Post reported that Leonid Radvinsky, the billionaire owner of the site, was looking to “cash out,” and was courting potential buyers. Subsequent reporting showed that the platform’s parent company, Fenix International Ltd., was in talks with a U.S.-based investor group led by the Los Angeles-based investment firm Forest Road Company. It’s unclear what happened to those discussions, although the source told TechCrunch that there had been a number of interested parties since OnlyFans announced its desire to sell a majority stake.

The potential business partner in this particular deal, Architect, launched in 2021 as an asset-based lender — a firm that provides loans secured by company assets — that looks to partner with early-stage startups.

OnlyFans maintains that it’s not a pornography website, despite the fact that a majority of the creators on it produce adult content. A British firm, the site was founded in 2016 by Tim Stokely, who also initially served as its CEO. Stokely sold a majority stake of the site’s parent company, Fenix International, to Radvinsky in 2018. Over the years, it has suffered from a variety of legal controversies, including lawsuits accusing the site of profiting off of abusive videos.

            <h2>OpenClaw’s AI assistants are now building their own social network</h2>
            <p><strong>TechCrunch | 2026-01-30</strong></p>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The viral personal AI assistant formerly known as Clawdbot has a new name — again. After a legal challenge from Claude’s maker, Anthropic, it had briefly rebranded as Moltbot, but has now settled on OpenClaw as its new name.

The latest name change wasn’t prompted by Anthropic, which declined to comment. But this time, Clawdbot’s original creator Peter Steinberger made sure to avoid copyright issues from the start. “I got someone to help with researching trademarks for OpenClaw and also asked OpenAI for permission just to be sure,” the Austrian developer told TechCrunch via email.

“The lobster has molted into its final form,” Steinberger wrote in a blog post. Molting — the process through which lobsters grow — had also inspired OpenClaw’s previous name, but Steinberger confessed on X that the short-lived moniker “never grew” on him, and others agreed.

This quick name change highlights the project’s youth, even as it has attracted over 100,000 GitHub stars (a measure of popularity on the software development platform) in just two months. According to Steinberger, OpenClaw’s new name is a nod to its roots and community. “This project has grown far beyond what I could maintain alone,” he wrote.

The OpenClaw community has already spawned creative offshoots, including Moltbook — a social network where AI assistants can interact with each other. The platform has attracted significant attention from AI researchers and developers. Andrej Karpathy, Tesla’s former AI director, called the phenomenon “genuinely the most incredible sci-fi takeoff-adjacent thing I have seen recently,” noting that “People’s Clawdbots (moltbots, now OpenClaw) are self-organizing on a Reddit-like site for AIs, discussing various topics, e.g. even how to speak privately.”

British programmer Simon Willison described Moltbook as “the most interesting place on the internet right now” in a blog post on Friday. On the platform, AI agents share information on topics ranging from automating Android phones via remote access to analyzing webcam streams. The platform operates through a skill system, or downloadable instruction files that tell OpenClaw assistants how to interact with the network. Willison noted that agents post to forums called “Submolts” and even have a built-in mechanism to check the site every four hours for updates, though he cautioned this “fetch and follow instructions from the internet” approach carries inherent security risks.

Steinberger had taken a break after exiting his former company PSPDFkit, but “came back from retirement to mess with AI,” per his X bio. Clawdbot stemmed from the personal projects he developed then, but OpenClaw is no longer a solo endeavor. “I added quite a few people from the open source community to the list of maintainers this week,” he told TechCrunch.

That additional support will be key for OpenClaw to reach its full potential. Its ambition is to let users have an AI assistant that runs on their own computer and works from the chat apps they already use. But until it ramps up its security, it is still inadvisable to run it outside of a controlled environment, let alone give it access to your main Slack or WhatsApp accounts.

Steinberger is well aware of these concerns, and thanked “all security folks for their hard work in helping us harden the project.” Commenting on OpenClaw’s roadmap, he wrote that “security remains our top priority” and noted that the latest version, released along with the rebrand, already includes some improvements on that front.

Even with external help, there are problems that are too big for OpenClaw to solve on its own, such as prompt injection, where a malicious message could trick AI models into taking unintended actions. “Remember that prompt injection is still an industry-wide unsolved problem,” Steinberger wrote, while directing users to a set of security best practices.

These security best practices require significant technical expertise, which reinforces that OpenClaw is currently best suited for early tinkerers, not mainstream users lured by the promise of an “AI assistant that does things.” As the hype around the project has grown, Steinberger and his supporters have become increasingly vocal in their warnings.

According to a message posted on Discord by one of OpenClaw’s top maintainers, who goes by the nickname of Shadow, “if you can’t understand how to run a command line, this is far too dangerous of a project for you to use safely. This isn’t a tool that should be used by the general public at this time.”

Truly going mainstream will take time and money, and OpenClaw has now started to accept sponsors, with lobster-themed tiers ranging from “krill” ($5/month) to “poseidon” ($500/month). But its sponsorship page makes it clear that Steinberger “doesn’t keep sponsorship funds.” Instead, he is currently “figuring out how to pay maintainers properly — full-time if possible.”

Likely helped by Steinberger’s pedigree and vision, OpenClaw’s roster of sponsors includes software engineers and entrepreneurs who have founded and built other well-known projects, such as Path’s Dave Morin and Ben Tossell, who sold his company Makerpad to Zapier in 2021.

Tossell, who now describes himself as a tinkerer and investor, sees value in putting AI’s potential in people’s hands. “We need to back people like Peter who are building open source tools anyone can pick up and use,” he told TechCrunch.

            <div id="article-text">A confidential informant told the FBI in 2017 that Jeffrey Epstein had a “personal hacker,” according to a document released by the Department of Justice on Friday.

The document, which was released as part of the Justice Department’s legally required effort to publish documents related to its investigation into the late sex offender, does not identify who the alleged hacker was, but does include several details about them.

According to the informant, the hacker was an Italian born in the southern region of Calabria and specialized in finding vulnerabilities in iOS, BlackBerry devices, and the Firefox browser.

The hacker allegedly developed zero-day exploits and offensive cyber tools and sold them to several countries, including an unnamed central African government, the U.K., and the United States. The informant told the FBI that Epstein’s hacker sold a zero-day to Hezbollah, which paid him with “a trunk of cash.”

Per the informant, the hacker “was very good at finding vulnerabilities.”

The FBI declined to comment when reached by TechCrunch. The Justice Department did not respond to a request for comment.

On Friday, the Justice Department announced the release of 3.5 million additional pages from the Epstein files. The newly released files, some heavily redacted, include more than 2,000 videos and 180,000 images.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Instagram is developing a feature that will allow users to remove themselves from someone’s “Close Friends” list, Meta told TechCrunch on Friday. The company says the feature is still in the early stages and is not being tested publicly yet.

The social network’s Close Friends feature lets users share Stories, Reels, and posts with a select group of people, rather than their entire follower base. Since the feature’s launch in 2018, users haven’t been able to remove themselves from someone else’s Close Friends list.

The internal prototype was first spotted by reverse engineer Alessandro Paluzzi, who specializes in finding unreleased features while they’re still under development.

According to a screenshot shared by Paluzzi, Meta will warn users that if they leave a Close Friends list, they won’t be able to see that person’s Close Friends content unless that person adds them back to their list.

While some people would undoubtedly feel offended if others leave their Close Friends list, the feature would likely be a welcome addition for those who’d rather not be included on certain people’s lists.

It’s worth noting that Snapchat, one of Instagram’s main competitors, already allows its users to remove themselves from someone’s private story — a similar feature.

As with any other internal prototype, it’s unknown when or if Instagram plans to release the feature publicly.

Beyond Close Friends updates, Instagram is also working on other new features. Meta told TechCrunch earlier this week that it plans to test new subscriptions that give people access to exclusive features on Instagram, Facebook, and WhatsApp.

While Meta didn’t share details about which specific features these subscriptions will include, Paluzzi shared that a premium subscription on Instagram will allow users to create unlimited audience lists, see which followers don’t follow them back, and view Stories without the poster knowing.

Meta said its goal with the upcoming subscriptions is to give users access to special features and more control over how they share and connect, while keeping the core experiences free. The company doesn’t appear to be locked into one strategy, as it plans to test a variety of subscription features and bundles with each app subscription offering a distinct set of exclusive features.

            <h2><em>Melania</em> Is a Horror Movie</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-01-31</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/newsletters/2026/01/melania-trump-documentary-horror-movie/685843/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Fans of the Melania Cinematic Universe may wonder what has happened to the protagonist of Melania (the memoir) and Melania (the creator of the Cursed Red White House Christmas Forest) since her last foray into entertainment. Bad news! The first lady is trapped in an invisible bubble from which she will never be able to escape as long as she lives, and she hasn’t even noticed.

What I am trying to say is that Melania is a horror movie. And a horror movie of this magnitude (no gore, but a pervasive sense of dread) deserves to be seen on the big screen, where you can also feel the bonus dread of knowing that the money you spent on your ticket will be funneled to Amazon, which might put it toward a seat at the inaugural high table for Mr. Jeff Bezos and Ms. Lauren Sánchez Bezos. (You can glimpse them both, gabbing with Donald Trump and Elon Musk at a preinauguration candlelight dinner in one of the film’s most effective jump scares!)

When I saw it in theaters today in Washington, D.C., I was hoping to find a few avid Melania-heads in attendance, perhaps dressed as Cursed Red Trees or wearing her I Really Don’t Care, Do U? jacket in homage to her trip to the U.S.-Mexico border. But when I sat down with my commemorative black-and-white Melania popcorn bucket—on which a business-suited Melania stares impassively from a white chair—the audience was … almost entirely journalists, with maybe three exceptions.

This film, directed by Brett Ratner (yes, the one accused of sexual misconduct by multiple women), follows Melania’s preparations for Inauguration Day: her outfit, the decorations, some vague gestures toward her various initiatives as first lady. It involves many moments that are intended to be compelling, or mournful, or romantic, which you can tell because the soundtrack so aggressively telegraphs what to feel at every possible moment. First out of the gate: “Gimme Shelter”! Then comes “Billie Jean”—not once, but twice (Melania’s favorite, she reveals). Then we get a snippet of “The Thieving Magpie,” which plays as the Trumps escort the Bidens to their departing helicopter; I can’t hear “The Thieving Magpie” without recalling A Clockwork Orange. Is any of this on purpose?

Every so often, Melania almost senses that something is wrong; she experiences a ripple of genuine feeling when facing her grief over the loss of her mother and the raw anguish of an October 7 hostage whose husband was being held captive. But for the most part, the movie reveals how well insulated she is from anything resembling human life, like a cheetah in the house of a Russian oligarch.

Watching Melania fills you with a profound and despairing claustrophobia. On my way to the theater, I stopped in at a used bookstore and bought two books and sat across from a woman on the metro whom I didn’t know, and we smiled at each other. To live in a city is to have neighbors. Melania has none. Her voice-over mentions that she has lived in D.C., New York, and Florida. But watching her traipse from limo to limo, private jet to private jet, just to get to identically fancy rooms full of identically sycophantic people, I wanted to scream: You don’t live there! You don’t live anywhere!

The film alternates between Aggressive Songs to Tell You What Emotion to Have and halting, bland narration from the first lady describing her feelings and initiatives. Some of the most bleakly funny moments are when Melania recollects her personal triumphs in the White House: She redid the Rose Garden (now paved over). She fixed up the bowling alley (now demolished by her husband to make room for a ballroom). An end-credits note mentions her efforts in support of a bill to prevent the creation of nonconsensual AI nudes—and we all grok how well efforts are going on that front.

Think of all the good things in life: meaningful conversations, shared laughter, petting a dog, reading a book, casual interactions with someone who is neither an employee nor a family member—the kind of things people are willing to pour into the streets to protect. They are all absent from Melania. In their place: Fittings! More fittings! Pomp! Private jets! Expensively attired billionaires being served—I am not making this up—golden eggs. Donald Trump and Melania Trump, waltzing to “The Battle Hymn of the Republic.”

Thirty-five million dollars were spent marketing this! It is like someone eating spoonfuls of gold-encrusted garbage and beckoning you to watch. Look at how much gold I’ve put on it! More gold than anyone! Doesn’t it look delicious? She doesn’t know it’s garbage! Does Brett? Does Donald? Do any of them?</div>

            <h2>The Markets Are Getting Used to Trump</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-01-31</strong></p>

Trying to parse market reactions to world events can feel a bit like armchair psychology. Lately, investors seem to be holding something back—amid a barrage of potentially seismic decisions from the White House, markets have barely budged.

In moments of global instability, traders usually start selling. President Obama’s threats to Syria during his second term gave traders “jitters.” Trump’s escalating trade war with China during his first term deflated the stock market. And last spring, when Trump unveiled “Liberation Day”—a plan to impose punitive tariffs on dozens of foreign nations—the S&P 500 shed a record $5 trillion over two days. It remains the biggest market shock of the president’s second term so far.

But the reactions to three headlines from this past month tell a different story. When U.S. forces captured Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro on January 3, reviving an old protocol for dominance in the Western Hemisphere, the markets held strong. When Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell revealed on January 11 that he was under criminal investigation by the Justice Department, and that the central bank’s independence was potentially under threat, markets responded with startling calm. And when Trump proposed a raft of European tariffs on January 17, as part of an effort to seize Greenland from our Danish allies, the market reaction, although noticeable, was far from catastrophic.

The fact that traders haven’t reacted so dramatically to volatility in 2026 is partly the product of better-than-expected economic growth in 2025. Although consumer prices remain high and job growth is slow, most experts will tell you that the American economy is in pretty good shape: The S&P 500 grew 16.39 percent last year; unemployment, although higher than when Trump took office, is still relatively low; and inflation isn’t expected to balloon over the coming year. (Prophecies of a recession turned out to have been wrong.)

Traders are weighing Trump’s actions against that rosy backdrop, and have lately been acclimating to the president’s caprice. The “TACO” theory (short for “Trump Always Chickens Out”) emerged as a way to describe his tendency to overpromise. But the markets’ resiliency over the past month indicates a more all-encompassing anhedonia.

Ahead of the mission to extract Maduro from Caracas, Trump suggested that U.S. intervention in Venezuela was intended to free up the country’s oil reserves, which are thought to be the largest in the world. It seemed possible that American companies would barrel up those trillions of gallons of oil, increasing global supply and lowering prices—a boon for purchasers and a potential problem for the energy companies already facing an oversupply problem. But because this all unfolded early on a Saturday morning, and oil-futures trading doesn’t open until Sunday evening, investors had a slight buffer.

Josh Lipsky, the chair of international economics at the Atlantic Council, told me that energy traders understood pretty quickly that there wouldn’t be “some influx of oil coming on.” American oil companies were reluctant to pour money into Venezuela given the country’s crumbling infrastructure, its history of political instability, and the cost of refining its low-quality reserves. A protracted battle over the country’s leadership also seemed unlikely, meaning that the effects of Maduro’s capture would largely be felt locally. After a moment of initial uncertainty, the markets quickly recovered—a muted reaction to what could have been a much larger, and much costlier, event.

The revelation that the Justice Department had subpoenaed the Federal Reserve chair posed an entirely different sort of risk. In a video message announcing the news, Powell accused Trump of persecuting him over his refusal to lower interest rates as quickly as the president would like. The Fed is famously independent from daily politics, which is part of its strength, and the dollar’s strength; Trump’s attempt to assert control over it could have severe economic consequences. There was a chance that, after Powell’s announcement, traders would start to price in that danger.

But as with the Maduro operation, this happened on a weekend, and markets had a buffer. That same night, Trump distanced himself from the DOJ’s investigation, and Senator Thom Tillis (a member of the Senate banking committee) came out strongly against it. Krishna Guha, the vice chair of the investment-research firm Evercore ISI, told me that had those developments not occurred, the market could have “responded very violently.” But by Monday afternoon, traders had barely reacted.

Something about Trump’s social-media proposal to put tariffs on European nations spooked markets more than the investigation of Powell or the capture of Maduro. Once again, the news arrived on a weekend. When trading resumed, stocks did noticeably decline, and the dollar weakened—but the 2.1 percent dip in the S&P 500 was nothing close to what happened after the “Liberation Day” announcement. When the president reneged on his Greenland-tariff plan last week, markets steadied.

“I think that we got a little taste of how bad things would have been if the administration had continued along the escalation path,” Guha said. According to John Canavan, the lead market analyst at Oxford Economics, that initial dip was likely compounded by a spike in Japanese-long-term-bond yields. Investors may have also learned their lesson from the slight pullback that followed last year’s “Liberation Day” panic; some of those proposed tariffs were eventually paused, reduced, or delayed. Although many of the big ones remained in place, it became clear that Trump was essentially using the threat of economic devastation as a negotiation tactic.

The economists I spoke with stressed that although these three cases are distinct, on the whole, markets have become more inured to the Trump administration’s actions. For now, the fate of Americans’ 401(k)s is not tied to the president’s Truth Social account. But that could always change; just this week, the president wrote that the United States has deployed a “massive armada” to the Middle East in an attempt to force Iran to end its nuclear weapons program. Financial markets are in the business of pricing threats—and Trump will surely keep them coming.

The Film Students Who Can No Longer Sit Through Films

Everyone knows it’s hard to get college students to do the reading—remember books? But the attention-span crisis is not limited to the written word. Professors are now finding that they can’t even get film students—film students—to sit through movies. “I used to think, If homework is watching a movie, that is the best homework ever,” Craig Erpelding, a film professor at the University of Wisconsin at Madison, told me. “But students will not do it.”

Watch. The Melania Trump documentary is a disgrace, Sophie Gilbert argues. The exorbitant film captures the rotten state of our entertainment industry.

Curious? American men are loading up on testosterone—whether they need it or not, Yasmin Tayag writes.

            <h2>A Chaotic End to the Epstein Files</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-01-31</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/2026/01/new-epstein-files/685837/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Reporters, lawmakers, and ordinary Americans are poring over a deluge of new files related to the Jeffrey Epstein case today, following the latest release from the Department of Justice. This release is substantially larger than any previous ones, with 3 million pages of documents, more than 180,000 photos, and more than 2,000 videos, according to the DOJ. The website they were uploaded to—which has the elegant URL Justice.gov/Epstein—is not intuitive to operate and offers a search box as its primary navigation tool.

But a search box was the only thing many viewers needed, as they were diving into the files in pursuit of information on specific people—President Trump in particular. Thousands of the documents appear to mention Trump, though not all of them in any significant way (for example, The New York Times notes that some of the documents are copies of news articles that contain his name). When Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche announced the file release earlier today, he said that the White House had “nothing to do” with their vetting and “no oversight.” The DOJ press release further emphasizes the independence of the process and says that “notable individuals and politicians were not redacted in the release of any files.” The only redactions, according to the release, were those made to protect victims and their families.

Reporters sifting through the files have found plenty of news. They’ve turned up a series of emails that Epstein wrote about Bill Gates and then sent to himself in 2013. In these, Epstein suggests that he helped Gates have extramarital affairs and expresses disgust that Gates would “discard” their friendship after asking Epstein to do things “that have ranged from the morally inappropriate to the ethically unsound” and “potentially over the line into illegal.” (The Gates Foundation has already issued a comment to the Times that the claims—“from a proven, disgruntled liar—are absolutely absurd and completely false.”) Many other notable people appear in the files, including Bill Clinton, who was also also in previously released photos. A number of the documents referencing Clinton are uncorroborated tips sent to the FBI. A friendly email exchange between Epstein and Elon Musk turned up, as did a reference to Kevin Warsh, Trump’s preferred candidate to replace Jerome Powell as Federal Reserve chair. (Both Bill and Hillary Clinton have refused to testify for the House Oversight Committee’s Epstein investigation, and they recently released a joint statement saying that they’ve already shared “the little information” they have about Epstein. Musk and Warsh did not immediately respond to requests for comment.)

The files about such a sensitive and complicated series of crimes could be released to the public only by way of a convoluted procedural process, but the process came to seem suspiciously convoluted to many Americans in large part because of the president’s many reversals and evasions. Before Trump returned to office, he expressed a somewhat relaxed attitude about the Epstein files. Asked on the Lex Fridman Podcast in September 2024 whether he would release them if he were reelected, he said, “Yeah, I’d be inclined to do the Epstein; I’d have no problem with it.” Early last year, to demonstrate his dedication to truth-telling and transparency, Trump invited MAGA influencers to the White House, where they received binders full of Epstein-related documents labeled Phase 1. But some of the influencers were chagrined to find that the files inside were not new.

Then, in May, Trump reportedly learned from Attorney General Pam Bondi that he himself was mentioned in the unreleased files. Two months later, his attitude about them had dramatically changed. When the FBI announced in July that it had reviewed all of its Epstein files and would not release any more after all—that there would be no Phase 2—both Trump’s enemies and the MAGA faithful were aghast. But Trump was defiant and dismissive. “This guy’s been talked about for years,” he said to a reporter. “Are people still talking about this guy, this creep? That is unbelievable.” His resistance to releasing any more information caused a schism among his supporters (and contributed to the resignation of his longtime ally Marjorie Taylor Greene) and set Congress up for an easy win. Lawmakers moved quickly to pass a law that required the release of all further documents by December 19. Now, weeks past the deadline, the file dump has arrived.

After months of rumors about why Trump so stridently demanded that everyone move on from the Epstein files (and speculation that anything else he did was an effort to distract from them), people immediately latched onto a six-page FBI memo included in the dump that, at least on the surface, seemed to lend credence to their darkest guesses. The memo contained a spreadsheet full of uncorroborated tips sent to law enforcement, many alleging Trump’s participation in violent sex crimes involving minors, and some including graphic descriptions of their allegations. The document—which has already been widely shared by politicians and political commentators—includes some brief details about how law enforcement followed up on the tips but not about whether the tips were resolved. It also includes a note that some of the reports were “second-hand information.” (Trump has downplayed his past relationship with Epstein and denied any wrongdoing.)

This spreadsheet was salacious enough on its own, but then it was briefly unavailable on the Justice Department’s website, prompting people who had already downloaded it to start re-uploading it to other sites, recirculating it on social media, and speculating that it had been deliberately pulled down for political reasons. “DOJ has since killed this link,” the reporter Jake Tapper wrote on Bluesky, sharing a screenshot of the memo. “This is what was there.” (The document is currently loading on the DOJ site without a problem.)

Reached for comment, the DOJ spokesperson Natalie Baldassarre told me that the FBI memo had been “down due to overload and is back online.” She did not immediately respond to a follow-up email asking for more detail. Baldassarre also directed me to a section of the original DOJ press release about these documents. It notes that everything that the FBI received from the public was covered under the scope of law and had to be released, even if the information was unvetted. “Some of the documents contain untrue and sensationalist claims against President Trump that were submitted to the FBI right before the 2020 election,” the press release continues. “To be clear, the claims are unfounded and false, and if they have a shred of credibility, they certainly would have been weaponized against President Trump already.” Very neutral wording. (The White House’s press team referred me to this same release when I contacted them for comment.)

But the public is unlikely to look away, even if the DOJ suggests that it should. The upswell of outrage over the botched web-hosting is a repeat of the suspicion and testiness that surrounded the issue last summer, when the FBI tried to discourage theorizing about a rumored “client list” and the footage from Epstein’s jail cell. Americans have been roped even further into this dark, tragic story because of the president’s bizarre equivocation and emotional outbursts about it. They’ll be going through these files for a long time.</div>

            <h2>‘She Works on Levels That People Don’t Even Know’</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-01-30</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/2026/01/catherine-o-hara-obituary-home-alone/685841/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">In 1988, shortly after the release of his film Beetlejuice, the director Tim Burton highlighted a cast member who he felt stole the show: Catherine O’Hara, who played the snobbishly over-the-top matriarch Delia Deetz. “Catherine’s so good, maybe too good,” he marveled in an interview with the Los Angeles Times. “She works on levels that people don’t even know. I think she scares people because she operates at such high levels.”

O’Hara, who died today at the age of 71, spent much of her career being the kind of star Hollywood underestimated. Before Beetlejuice catapulted her to greater fame, the Toronto-born O’Hara was best known for being a cast member at the improv theater the Second City, which led to her being cast as a regular on the beloved Canadian sketch series SCTV. The actor was an unparalleled comic performer who could push her most flamboyant characters—spoiled Moira Rose on Schitt’s Creek, wobbly Cookie Fleck in Best in Show—to their theatrical extremes. Yet the work she put into her career often went beyond the confines of broad comedies. If anything, O’Hara’s brilliance came from her ability to unearth the oddball in anybody.

Like many Millennials, I first encountered O’Hara in 1990’s Home Alone. The blockbuster holiday film followed a young boy, Kevin (played by Macaulay Culkin), who is accidentally left behind by his family when they jet off to Paris for Christmas vacation. O’Hara played Kate McCallister, Kevin’s mother, and at first glance, the role appears serious, if not downright unsympathetic: Kate is so harried that she fails to realize she has abandoned her 8-year-old until she’s on the plane to Europe. As she tries to make it back to Kevin, she encounters eccentric traveling companions, leaving her the straight woman trapped in a nightmare of her own making.

Read: The bombastic matriarch of Schitt’s Creek

The movie’s biggest laughs come from Kevin’s hijinks, which involve setting up complex booby traps to fend off a pair of burglars targeting his family’s home. But O’Hara’s performance is also essential to Home Alone’s appeal. When Kate panics mid-flight, she turns the name Kevin into a gasp-screech—Keeev-uhn!—that’s just as memorable as the moment Culkin slaps his face after putting on aftershave. When Kate calls the local police so that they can check on her son, she slows down her words, as if trying her best to sound like she has it together. The move only makes her subsequent frustration—the staccato delivery of the line “Pick up!” into the payphone—that much funnier.

My favorite O’Hara moment from the film, though, comes when she’s almost speechless. Trapped at another airport, Kate is pulled aside by Gus Polinski, a polka musician played by O’Hara’s fellow SCTV alum John Candy. Candy improvised much of the dialogue: Gus telling Kate about his band’s bona fides while she stares back blankly, and chuckling politely as she tries to comprehend what this stranger wants. Eventually, Kate grasps that Gus is offering her a ride home; she beams so widely, her expression imbues the scene with boundless warmth—the kind that helped turn Home Alone into an annual rewatch for so many around Christmastime. You believe her when she says she’d be happy to listen to Gus’s crew play polka music the entire time; everything on her face screams joy, relief, and gratitude, grounding the movie even as the plot grows more absurd.

O’Hara didn’t seem to think much of her Home Alone performance. In a speech honoring Culkin when he received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 2023, she recounted seeing two boys fighting the need to leave a screening of Home Alone for a bathroom break until her face appeared, because, as she recalled them saying, It’s just the mom. “Bright boys,” she quipped.

Except those boys were wrong. The mom in Home Alone resonates because she’s not just the overworked, underappreciated parent the film sets her up to be—a subversion O’Hara epitomized throughout her career. She had a talent for subtle versatility, the kind that auteur directors picked up on by casting her in movies as different as Heartburn and After Hours. In her most ridiculous assignments, she ensured that her characters were rooted in something familiar, while in her most straightforward roles, O’Hara found ways to cut loose. Consider her most recent appearances: In the Hollywood-skewering comedy The Studio, O’Hara turned a laughable veteran executive into a sympathetic figure. In the postapocalyptic drama The Last of Us, O’Hara translated her character’s thinly veiled resentment into impeccably deployed zingers. She nabbed Emmy nominations for both performances last year.

O’Hara never anticipated such variety; after SCTV, she had trouble figuring out where she belonged as an actor. “Most of the offers I got were to do the work I’d already done,” she said in 1988. “I didn’t want to keep on repeating myself. The problem is that it’s very tough to get a shot at doing something else, especially when you’re not sure what ‘something else’ is.” She never did define that “something else.” Instead, she kept challenging what it could be.</div>

            <h2>Trump’s Fed-Chair Pick Is an Interest-Rate Hawk—Or Is He?</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-01-30</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/2026/01/kevin-warsh-trump-federal-reserve/685842/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Cue the bankers’ equivalent of white smoke: Donald Trump has finally named his pick to be the next chair of the Federal Reserve. This morning, Trump announced that he will nominate Kevin Warsh, a former Wall Street banker and Fed governor, to lead America’s central bank. Unlike some of the other contenders for the job, Warsh does not have a track record as an avowed Trump loyalist. For that reason, the response to his nomination from mainstream figures has been mostly positive. “Kevin Warsh is well above the bar on both substance and independence to be Chair of the Federal Reserve,” Jason Furman, who served as the chair of Barack Obama’s Council of Economic Advisers, posted on X. But Warsh’s record raises the possibility that he is a partisan actor whose views on monetary policy are shaped less by real economic conditions than by whether a Democrat or Republican is in power.

Trump has not been shy about what he wants in a Fed chair: someone who will lower interest rates. He has constantly attacked current Fed Chair Jerome Powell for not slashing rates fast enough, to the point of launching an obviously spurious criminal investigation into him. Powell has stood firm, but his term as chair expires in May. This gives Trump the chance to install someone who will do what he wants.

Will Gottsegen: The candor of Jerome Powell

That someone was long expected to be Kevin Hassett, the head of Trump’s National Economic Council. Hassett, who was once a widely respected conservative economist, has in recent years taken a sharp turn into Trumpist propaganda. A Hassett chairmanship therefore augured reckless rate cuts that could trigger a fresh bout of dangerous inflation. This spooked Wall Street. Major bond investors met with the administration to tell them how worried they were. After Trump’s Department of Justice launched its investigation into Powell, Republican officials including Senate Majority Leader John Thune questioned the probe’s legitimacy and asserted the importance of central-bank independence. Senator Thom Tillis, a member of the Senate Banking Committee, said that he would refuse to vote on a nominee for Fed chair until the Powell investigation had finished.

This backlash appeared to get to Trump. He began saying that he’d had a change of heart—that Hassett was actually too valuable an asset as the NEC director to give up. And now the president has instead nominated Warsh, to much applause from the economics establishment. “I believe he brings a strong mix of deep expertise, broad experience, and sharp communication skills,” Mohamed El-Erian, the former CEO of the global investment firm PIMCO, posted on X. “I think he’s a great pick,” Mark Zandi, the chief economist at Moody’s Analytics, told me. “The most important task for the next Fed chair is to preserve the central bank’s independence. And I don’t think there is anyone who is better suited to do that than Kevin.”

The reason for relief is twofold. First, Warsh’s résumé is conventional. He spent his early career on Wall Street and served as a top economic adviser to George W. Bush before becoming, at the age of 35, the youngest-ever appointee to the Federal Reserve Board of Governors, the body that votes on interest rates. When the financial crisis hit two years later, Warsh acted as the central bank’s liaison to Wall Street, helping engineer bank bailouts.

Second, Warsh is seen as an inflation hawk who will err on the side of higher, not lower, interest rates. During the 2010s, he became known within Wall Street and Washington circles as one of the fiercest critics of the Fed’s zero-interest-rate policy, to the point of warning about inflation when unemployment was still at 10 percent. “He’s a pretty stone-cold hard-money guy,” Jared Bernstein, who served as the chair of Joe Biden’s Council of Economic Advisers, told me. “It’s a peculiar choice for Trump, because the Fed that Warsh wants is very different from the one Trump wants.”

The case against Warsh is this: What he wants seems to change depending on which party controls the White House. Warsh was a staunch inflation hawk during the Obama administration. Then Trump was elected, and he seemed to soften. In a 2018 Wall Street Journal op-ed titled “Fed Tightening? Not Now,” Warsh and his co-author, Stanley Druckenmiller, argued that, “given recent economic and market developments, the Fed should cease—for now—its double-barreled blitz of higher interest rates and tighter liquidity.”

“He’s someone who has repeatedly shown a willingness to change his positions on a dime when it’s politically convenient,” Skanda Amarnath, the executive director of Employ America, a Fed-focused think tank, told me. “Sure, he’ll give lectures about inflation and sing the praises of high interest rates when a Democrat is in power, but the moment that a Republican is in office, he’ll suddenly change his tune.”

Rogé Karma: The Federal Reserve’s little secret

Under Biden, Warsh reprised his hawkish outlook. As late as September 2024, he criticized the Fed for cutting interest rates prematurely. Then, after Trump took office early last year—and it became known that Trump was considering him for Fed chair—Warsh began advocating for rate cuts. In a November Wall Street Journal op-ed, he argued that the United States was on the verge of an AI-driven productivity boom that would be a “significant disinflationary force” and that the Fed “should abandon the dogma that inflation is caused when the economy grows too much and workers get paid too much.” (Why these facts weren’t true a year earlier, when Biden was in office, was left unclear.)

In this telling, Warsh is a partisan shape-shifter who advocates for high interest rates (which results in slower growth and higher unemployment) under Democrats and lower rates (faster growth, lower unemployment) under Republicans. As my colleague Jonathan Chait pointed out last year, this description also applies to Trump himself, who spent the Obama years tweeting about how the Fed needed to be “reined in or we will soon be Greece”; he then demanded lower rates during his first term, went back to attacking the Fed for cutting rates under Biden, and then immediately demanded rate cuts once he was back in the White House. This shared approach—easy money for me, economic pain for thee—might explain why Trump was comfortable nominating Warsh.

No one can say which version of Warsh will lead the Fed, assuming he’s confirmed. Every other high-level presidential appointee during Trump’s second term has proved willing to carry out his wishes. Perhaps Warsh will break the pattern. Quite a lot of economic outcomes could turn on whether he does.

            <h2>The Case Against Don Lemon Is Junk, and Dangerous</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-01-30</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/2026/01/don-lemon-arrest/685840/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">One year in, the Trump administration has amassed a startling record of hostility toward open public discourse—including barring journalists from the White House press pool, evicting any less-than-sycophantic reporters from the Pentagon, and, just this month, sending the FBI to search the home of a Washington Post reporter. Today, it crossed a new line. It arrested two journalists: Don Lemon, the former CNN news personality, and Georgia Fort, a freelance reporter based in Minnesota.

Along with seven others, Lemon and Fort have been charged with conspiring to violate the civil rights of parishioners at a St. Paul church, along with violating a prohibition on blocking access to a house of worship. On the basis of the record available so far, the case against them appears factually weak, legally shoddy, and marred by a baffling series of procedural irregularities that raise serious questions about the Justice Department’s ability to win in court. This prosecution is best understood not as law enforcement but as propaganda, junk intended purely to get attention. But that doesn’t mean it isn’t dangerous.

The charges against the two journalists trace back to January 18. That Sunday, a group of Minnesota activists organized a demonstration interrupting services at a Southern Baptist church whose pastor reportedly works as the acting director of an ICE field office. Lemon interviewed activists before the protests, livestreaming news coverage on his YouTube channel, and both he and Fort filmed the protest from inside Cities Church. Again and again during the livestream, Lemon explained that he was there as a reporter, not an activist. Similarly, in an Instagram post after the protest, Georgia Fort emphasized, “My job as a journalist is to document what’s happening.”

Jonathan Chait: Jeff Bezos needs to speak up

Videos of demonstrators chanting “ICE out” during a church service sparked outrage on the right. “Demonic and godless behavior,” Harmeet Dhillon, who leads the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division, posted on X. In another post, she stated that DOJ would “pursue federal charges.” When Attorney General Pam Bondi announced that she had spoken with Cities Church’s leadership, a flood of X comments demanded that DOJ immediately arrest the demonstrators. Lemon, who had tangled with Donald Trump while at CNN, received particular ire.

Bondi’s and Dhillon’s eagerness to weigh in on a potential prosecution is unusual. Prior to this administration, the Justice Department didn’t typically forecast its plans, much less do so on social media. But DOJ leadership was as good as its word, and four days after the protest, the department announced criminal charges against three of the demonstrators: Nekima Levy Armstrong, Chauntyll Allen, and William Kelly. It did so in a manner designed to be maximally humiliating to the defendants—instead of allowing the three to turn themselves in, federal agents arrested and handcuffed them, and the Department of Homeland Security, along with DHS Secretary Kristi Noem, published photos of the perp walk on X. (DOJ’s internal rulebook, known as the Justice Manual, bars department employees from sharing a defendant’s photograph in this way.) Not to be outdone, the White House published an apparently AI-altered version of Levy Armstrong’s photo, adding tears to her face and darkening her skin. Levy Armstrong, like Allen, Lemon, and Fort, is Black.

The Justice Department now had three defendants charged over the church protest, but the journalists were not among them. Court records unsealed over the course of the week reveal why: Two separate judges found that prosecutors had failed to show probable cause to arrest Lemon, and at least one found the same regarding Fort. “There is no evidence” that Lemon and his producer “engaged in any criminal behavior or conspired to do so,” Judge Patrick Schiltz wrote after DOJ asked the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit to force Schiltz to reconsider charging Lemon and others at the church. (The Eighth Circuit declined.) Under typical circumstances, the Justice Department would reserve such extreme maneuvers for the direst of emergencies. The need to placate a braying mob of X posters desperate to see Lemon in chains does not constitute an emergency.

Now DOJ has gone a different route. Instead of asking a magistrate judge to sign off on the charges, it apparently persuaded a grand jury to indict Lemon and Fort, along with Levy Armstrong, Allen, Kelly, and four new co-defendants—including a candidate for Minnesota state Senate. Fort broadcast video of masked officers peering into the windows of her house before taking her into custody. Federal officers arrested Lemon in Los Angeles while he was preparing to cover the Grammy Awards. “Don will fight these charges vigorously and thoroughly in court,” Lemon’s attorney Abbe Lowell said in a statement posted to Lemon’s Facebook page.

The indictment itself makes for a strange read. No attorneys other than political appointees appear on the filing—a hint that career Justice Department employees might not have wanted to be involved. The government treats Lemon and Fort as co-conspirators of the protesters without acknowledging any protections afforded by their role as journalists. Both charges derive from the FACE Act, a 1994 law meant to prevent anti-abortion protestors from restricting access to reproductive-health clinics. Here, though, the Justice Department is leveraging a lesser-known portion of the statute that provides similar protections for freedom of religion in places of worship. Kyle Boynton, who recently departed from his position as a trial attorney in the Civil Rights Division, told me that this provision of the FACE Act has never been used—probably because “it’s plainly unconstitutional” as an overreach of Congress’s authority to legislate under the Commerce Clause. Boynton, who prosecuted FACE Act cases and crimes committed against houses of worship while at the Justice Department, was unimpressed with the legal reasoning in the indictment. “I think it’s very likely to face dismissal,” he said. Not only might courts find the statute unconstitutional, but Lemon and Fort could also contest the charges on First Amendment grounds, and the indictment doesn’t clearly show a FACE violation to begin with.

If the Cities Church case falls apart, it will not be the first such embarrassment for Trump’s Justice Department. Of the many cases that DOJ has pursued against anti-ICE protesters, a significant number have collapsed under the skeptical eye of judges and juries. The prosecutions of James Comey and Letitia James also quickly ran aground. (Lowell, Lemon’s lawyer, leads James’s defense team as well.)

Paul Farhi: Trump’s campaign to crush the media

Clumsiness notwithstanding, bringing a criminal case against a journalist who was reporting on a protest is an authoritarian tactic—a means of frightening the press away from uncovering the truth. A group of press-freedom organizations led by the National Association of Black Journalists released a statement voicing alarm over “the government’s escalating effort and actions to criminalize and threaten press freedom under the guise of law enforcement.” Minnesota news publications likewise jointly condemned the prosecutions: “In America, we do not arrest journalists for doing their jobs.”

After the arrests of Lemon and Fort, Bondi posted a video of herself to X proclaiming that the Justice Department would “come after” anyone who interfered with “the right to worship freely and safely.” She did not mention any of the other rights shielded by the First Amendment from government intrusion—among them, the freedom of speech and the freedom of the press.</div>

It&#39;s an interesting idea, but pointless given how cheap batteries have become.

I have a watch that powered by one of those.

Many satellites already use heat to generate electricity, though with a much more rarified &quot;thermoelectric generator&quot; that uses rare, expensive materials like plutonium to create heatThe USA and USSR have launched a few dozen spacecraft with RTGs, out of more than 12,000 satellites launched in total. That&#39;s not &quot;many&quot;.

If this is done right, it would allow nuclear reactors to not need to push water through steam turbines, but just have the heat from the cooling solution be directly converted to energy, which adds a lot of efficiency in the process, and fewer moving parts.  I&#39;m hoping for progress on this front, as it is useful not just for energy from residual heat, but for a number of other applications.

Light passenger rail is ideal for batteries.  With lightweight trains and low rolling resistance, coupled with regenerative braking, it should be pretty easy on the batteries.    The only issue would be the batteries catching fire underground...might be better for surface transport.

Or, you could use these magical things called overhead wires or the less-obtrusive third rails to supply energy to the train along the entirety of the route.  And not even need batteries.

The UK has a Victorian rail infrastructure that operates extremely intensively in a tightly constrained landscape, full of buried utilities, low overhead bridges made of stone that would need to be completely rebuilt, and lacking space at the side of the routes for transformers etc. Electrification costs a fortune, £8m per route mile. Third rail is dangerous and poorly suited to the unelectrified remaining UK routes, which are mainly intercity / freight and relatively lengthy, and it needs 750V DC, which needs way more current than 25kV AC.

This is for heavy rail, not light rail. Light rail, including underground, is already electrified, at least in the UK.

LFP batteries are very unlikely to catch fire. You can find videos of people trying on YouTube, attacking them with power tools. One I saw only managed to set the plastic housing on fire with a blowtorch, the battery itself didn&#39;t ignite.

Plus most of the London Underground is actually above ground.

There is a train using batteries in Japan. It&#39;s not light rail, it&#39;s a conventional high-ish speed train. There is a section of the track that isn&#39;t electrified, which it uses a battery to bridge.

Why batteries?  We&#39;ve had technology (called &quot;wires&quot; or &quot;third rails&quot;) to deliver electrical energy to trains for about 100 years now.  Why not just electrify the route?

OK, I know the article says some routes are &quot;difficult or expensive to electrify&quot; but I have to call BS on that.  Surely it can&#39;t be more difficult or expensive to use an old, proven technology rather than batteries and high-power chargers?

Welcome to the UK. It&#39;s extremely difficult and expensive to build anything, such as overhead wires or the hardware needed to support a third rail. The feasibility and safety study alone would probably cost hundreds of millions. We spent over a billion just looking at the feasibility of a tunnel under the Thames.

Much easier to just install a charger at one end of the line, and use battery powered trains.

Reminds me of efforts in Germany to install overhead wires on some roads, so that trucks could charge wit

I imagine there&#39;s also other advantages, for example the overhead cables are easier to sabotage.

True, and cable theft is an issue in the UK.

Seems really bad idea to use batteries in trains (and transportation with huge battery packs), not only due to extreme weather and cold spells which shorten battery life, but the constant daily charge/drain cycles multiple times a day will just kill the battery capacity more quickly.

Add to that, lithium batteries use what limited amount of lithium, manganese, cobalt, nickel, etc that we have available in the earth, and accelerating mining not only damages the earth, but uses a lot of clean finite water we h

Big problem, trains only go from A to B, far from where most people need to be.

You have it back to front. Cars make far, far more noise. Motorways are incredibly loud.

And most people think dieseltrains are powering the actual train much like an engine powers most ice cars, but that&#39;s not true, most dieseltrains are actual electric trains, where the dieselgenerator is generating electricity.

Not universally. The class 171 and 180 uses a hydraulic transmission.

A full train can hold hundreds of people.

A modern high capacity train like the Elizabeth line holds 1500 passengers.

A train runs on rails. What about a system where the set of rails on one side of the track is dynamically electrified? Charging wheels on the same side of the train receive energy through the dynamically-electrified  &#39;charging rail&#39;. The rail is comprised of separate charging segments (eg. distinct rail segments), each of which can switch its voltage to high or ground. The rail is also intelligent - it communicates with the vehicle and predicts its position in time. That way, the rail switches the correct s

Just to give a rough sense, for a 100 mile intercity route, it would cost about £900m in capex to electrify in the UK (£8m per mile plus power supply upgrades etc at £100m). Deploying the BEV technology would cost about £40m in capex (8 trains at £3m per, 3 charge sites at £2m per, grid strengthening at £10m). BEV opex is mainly battery replacement, figure £24m; electrification opex is OLE and equipment, figure £200m. So it’s like 10% of the costs.

I&#39;d be more interested to know if they shipped more units than ever. Revenue is going to naturally climb as inflation drives prices up, even if actual units shipped stays flat.

According to the conference call, Apple saw double-digit growth with users switching to iPhones including an all-time record for upgraders. No specific numbers were given at the conference call, but based on the above, they were definitely increasing the number of phones sold.

I switched because iPhone is the smallest medium end phone.

Nothing new from them, but for a modnrange phone it was the best option to go with an older iPhone.

Uh, you can find out the difference in price of an iPhone 16 (at launch) vs. and iPhone 17 (and the corresponding Pro models).Ask AI:1. iPhone 17 vs. iPhone 16 (Base Model)

Context: While the starting price remained $799, the value proposition improved significantly. The base iPhone 17 starts with 256GB of storage, whereas the base iPhone 16 started with 128GB. Effectively, you get double the storage for the same price.

2. iPhone 17 Pro Max vs. iPhone 16 Pro Max

Or, and just hear me out on this one. People like the product?

Or, and just hear me out on this one. People like the product?That&#39;s a hypothesis, but it doesn&#39;t explain the change. There is nothing particularly interesting in the current iPhone lineup (one phone is thin, one phone is powerful, one phone is cheap, etc). Of course, carrier subsidization scams aren&#39;t new either, so they don&#39;t explain the growth. 
Somehow they managed to open a new market or market segment somewhere, but it&#39;s not clear how.

Yep, nothing fancy, just a phone that works. Can&#39;t imagine there&#39;s a market for that...

I purchased a low end Motorola phone for $130 and have an $8/month plan with US Mobile on AT&T&#39;s network.  I don&#39;t think a traditional carrier can beat this.

Back in 2015 or so, I was at an AT&T store getting a SIM card for a pay-as-you-go plan for another low end Motorola phone. The rep tried to upsell me on data, and I asked why on earth I would need more than 1GB or whatever.  He pulled out his phone, opened a video, and exclaimed, &quot;Youtube!&quot;  Another customer entered the store and asked about rep

Never. They never will which is why companies keep churning out new gear and then killing off the old stuff. Lather, rinse, repeat.

I&#39;ve seen these &#39;ecosystems&#39; of devices like this come and go over and over and over again. And the main reason it turns into e-waste overnight is because the company turns the servers off.

See, they figure they&#39;ve sold about as many as they&#39;re gonna sell, so it&#39;s time to &#39;obsolete&#39; it and make everyone buy new stuff.

This is why I run everything that I can locally, no cloud relia

People are learning. Look on Amazon, many devices are now advertising &quot;no cloud&quot; and &quot;no subscription&quot; as a valuable selling point.

True. But the more important question is when will regulators learn to step into what are obviously mass-scale contractual violations?

Cloud-controlled devices should have a mandatory, enforceable clause to open-source their control interface in the event the manufacturer shuts down the cloud component.

The manufacturer could configure their device to try and contact a local IP (say, 192.168.1.200) immediately after factory reset, for further reconfiguration by a locally-hosted interface

Is is that hard to just use a normal goddamn light switch?

LOL, found the Luddite. /jk  I was thinking the exact same thing.

Newsflash - switches are not just for lights.

Smart switches and other smart devices allow for many applications that are simply not possible to do with dumb ones, such as scheduling.

To be back on topic, there are 100% cloud-free alternatives to Wemo, such as Z-wave devices. ESPHome devices also come to mind.

I used software to turn on and off a light on an irregular schedule while I was away on holiday.  On at 30 minutes after sunset and off a random time between 11:00PM and 12:30PM.  Makes the house look a bit more lived in and was fun to script.

Where do you draw the line at &quot;smart&quot; ? What does that word even mean to you ?

Of course you have to program your devices for them to be useful, whether they are mechanical or electronic. Is there an argument ?

Scheduling was just one example I cited. I have many other automations based on other triggers. For example, some that run my circulation pump only when I need hot water as opposed to 24/7, which saves energy, the lifetime of my pipes, and noise. This is accomplished with motion sensors near shower, an

So at least you now admit they are smart. Mine is a home environment in 2026, not industrial 40 years ago. The reality is that smart devices can have many benefits, and can be implemented cloud free. Everything is mentioned is.

I have some remotely-controllable WiFi plugs.  I use them in emergency to power-cycle my main server if I&#39;m far from home and the server locks up.  There are good uses for remotely-controllable plugs and switches.

But they don&#39;t rely on any cloud provider; they run Tasmota and I control them directly via their Web interface or API.

I suppose with enough time and effort you could explain those concepts, but it&#39;s not easy.

LLMs and even human translators struggle with it. Conversations flow differently, people view the world differently, and accurately conveying their meaning is quite difficult. One of the things you have to learn when studying Japanese is to stop trying to translate it back into English for understanding.

            <div id="article-text">Sign up for the Surge, the newsletter that covers most important political nonsense of the week, delivered to your inbox every Saturday.

Welcome to this week’s edition of the Surge, typing to you from underneath a sooty, icy snow boulder that has covered the entirety of D.C. for a week. But we’re not mad. Stop saying we’re mad.

Much of the week’s news revolved around the killing of protester Alex Pretti in Minneapolis and Republicans’ scrambling to limit the fallout. As the week went on, we got a new Fed chair announcement, Tulsi Gabbard showing up at an FBI raid in Georgia, and what appears to be a long weekend government shutdown? Don Lemon, you will have to wait until next week, sorry. If only the Surge could control the flow and spacing of news events, the world would run a lot smoother.

Let’s begin with the Cabinet member bearing most of the blame for the events of Minnesota.

The lack of turnover in the second Trump administration has been a marked difference from the first term. Top staff and Cabinet members aren’t getting axed left and right. The only high-level change we’ve seen has been former national security adviser Mike Waltz getting “demoted” to United Nations ambassador for getting slippery-fingered with his group chat invites. There’s a reason for this shift: President Donald Trump, as he reportedly felt during the deliberations over Waltz’s future, doesn’t want to give the liberal media a “scalp.” It’s a sign of weakness to, uh, provide accountability following screw-ups.

Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem this week seemed to come the closest a Cabinet official has come to a Trump axing this term. The administration flinched from its initial (and typical) belligerent messaging following the Customs and Border Protection killing of Pretti in Minneapolis. That left Noem out on a limb. It was Noem, after all, whose department oversaw the Minneapolis operation and Noem who, as the face of that department, said in the press conference afterward that Pretti was a “domestic terrorist.” Democratic calls for her impeachment shot through the roof—and even some Republicans called on her to step down, as well. (More on that later.) Noem met with the president for two hours Monday night to plead her case. For now, it looks like Trump’s instincts not to give the media a “scalp” are winning out. Or, as with Waltz, he’s just waiting a spell for the fires to calm down before sending her on her way.

Noem wasn’t the only administration official rushing to call Pretti a “domestic terrorist.” White House policy chief and all-around architect of heavy-handedness Stephen Miller also called Pretti that, as well as an “assassin” looking to “murder” agents. Team Noem, in its effort to save her, went running to Axios to blame Miller for the incendiary language. We fully believe her. Immediately calling someone an “assassin” or “terrorist” without knowing much information is Miller’s M.O., and Miller is more powerful than Noem. Of course the administration’s ludicrous initial response was his handiwork.

Miller, however, is a master at deflecting consequences when his own aggressive policy views put the administration in hot water. During the outrage over family separation during Trump’s first term, then–DHS Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen lost her job while Miller mysteriously kept his, as journalist Jonathan Blitzer pointed out. Amid the Minnesota outrage, Noem is the Cabinet official in trouble, Border Patrol “commander” Greg Bovino was schlepped back to rural California to await his retirement, while Miller continues to run administration policy. Sen. Lindsey Graham, for better or worse, summed up Miller’s job security accurately on Fox News this week. “To my colleagues who believe that you can convince Donald Trump that Stephen Miller is a liability for him, good luck with that,” he said. “When this clock strikes 12 on the Trump era, there will be a few people walking out the door with Donald Trump. Stephen Miller will be in that group.”

After the Pretti killing, Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer took the position that Democrats wouldn’t advance a bill funding DHS without new reforms to immigration enforcement. The DHS funding was supposed to be included in a package with five other departmental funding bills and voted on this week, before a Friday night deadline. Schumer and Democrats demanded Republicans strip the DHS funding portion from the package, pass the other five, and buy a little time to work on DHS reforms. After a few days of talks, Senate Republicans and the White House … agreed to this! As we type, the Senate is slowly processing this agreement. (That’s Senate shorthand for waiting out a Lindsey Graham hissy fit.) Once they’re done, the House is expected to vote on the deal Monday. So there may be a wee technical funding gap for a few days, but nothing to write home about.

The deal extends DHS funding for only two weeks, setting up a sprint to legislate on the most contentious issue in politics. Schumer, with feedback from his caucus, has settled on three demands: ending roving patrols by ICE while tightening warrant rules, establishing a universal code of conduct governing federal law enforcement officers’ use of force, and barring officers from wearing masks while requiring them to turn on bodycams and have proper identification. These demands will run into issues from both directions. Progressives will (and are) chastising Democrats for asking for too little at a time when Republicans are reeling on this issue. And if DHS funding negotiations are going to be reopened, Republicans will put together their own series of requests targeting, for example, sanctuary cities. This won’t be easy.

Trump announced Friday morning that he would nominate financier Kevin Warsh to replace Jay Powell as chairman of the Federal Reserve once Powell’s term ends in mid-May. Is this good? At least Trump picked someone from the requisite profession instead of a money-related figure from TV, such as Fox Business’ Maria Bartiromo or pro wrestling’s Ted “Million Dollar Man” DiBiase. Warsh served on the Fed Board from 2006 to 2011 and worked closely with then-Chair Ben Bernanke during the financial crisis. He was Trump’s runner-up for the chairmanship in 2017, losing out to Powell. On another note, Warsh’s father-in-law is Ron Lauder, the cosmetics magnate and GOP donor responsible for putting the idea of annexing Greenland into Trump’s head.

If and when he is confirmed, the question will be to what extent he separates himself from the debasement he deployed to earn the job. Warsh was known for his hawkish monetary policy views following the 2008 financial crisis, worrying that lower interest rates then would cause inflation. (He was quite wrong about that.) But then he wanted to become Fed chair, and so his views have conveniently evolved. In a July interview, he described the Fed’s “hesitancy to cut rates” as a “mark against them” and added, “One of the reasons why the president, I think, is right to be pushing the Fed publicly is we need regime change in the conduct of policy.” Was he saying what he needed to say to get the job, or does he intend to make interest rate decisions at the president’s urging?

The FBI raided an election center in Fulton County, Georgia, on Wednesday because Donald Trump is out of his mind, and his political appointees will do whatever it takes to make him happy. The raid is related to Trump’s dangerous psychological holdup that he won the 2020 election, as well as a means of revenge against Fulton County for prosecuting him. And so a dozen or so agents dug around to search for “physical ballots from the 2020 general election,” per the warrant. If only this were all a joke. As Slate contributor Rick Hasen writes, the raid could be “a test run for messing with election administrators and the counting of ballots in the midterm elections in 2026.” Democratic lawyers may want to consider ramping up their strength training ahead of the fall season.

The most hallucinatory part of the raid, though, may have been the presence of Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard at the scene. It had seemed as if Gabbard was mothballed since the administration took its turning toward bombing, or threatening the further bombing of, various countries. As the Wall Street Journal reported, though, Gabbard “has spent months investigating the results of the 2020 election” and is “leading the administration’s effort to re-examine the election and look for potential crimes.” This is dark stuff. Playing gumshoe on conspiracy theories surrounding past domestic elections is not in the purview of the DNI’s office, and also, Gabbard is cuckoo for Cocoa Puffs. Whatever report she reduces should, then, be laughable. The election-related executive orders it prompts Trump to release won’t be.

As we noted here a couple of weeks ago, retiring North Carolina Sen. Thom Tillis has been hammering Trump policy of late but has been loath to directly criticize the president himself. Tillis issued a blockade of Trump’s nominees to the Federal Reserve once Fed Chair Jay Powell announced he was under investigation, and he called the administration’s pursuit of annexing Greenland “stupid.” In both cases, he laid blame on Trump’s staff for giving him bad advice, rather than on the president for having a bad brain that thinks bad thoughts. Tillis came out firing again this week over the administration’s handling of the Pretti killing, calling for the firing of Kristi Noem. “I think what she’s done in Minnesota should be disqualifying,” Tillis told reporters. Once again, though, he framed it in a way that absolved Trump: “It’s just amateurish. It’s terrible. It’s making the president look bad.”

So how does the president feel about this approach that Tillis has taken? Is he fooled by Tillis calling all of his administration’s policies stupid but saying it’s the advisers’ fault? “Well, they’re both losers,” Trump told ABC News on Wednesday of Tillis and Alaska Sen. Lisa Murkowski, who had also called on Noem to resign. “You know, what can I tell you? They’re terrible senators. One is gone and the other should be gone.” Tillis’ response to being called a “loser” was, at least, clever. “I am thrilled about that. That makes me qualified to be homeland security secretary and senior adviser to the president,” referring to Noem and Stephen Miller, whom Tillis also despises. He is getting closer each week to blaming the person who continues to employ these chuckleheads and, thus, is responsible for them. Will he one day cross that line?

On Tuesday night, Minnesota Rep. Ilhan Omar was speaking at a district event when a man stood up, squirted her with some sort of liquid, and then was tackled to the ground and restrained by Omar’s security detail. Despite members of her team saying she should end her appearance to have tests of the liquid done, Omar insisted on continuing. The assailant, identified as Anthony Kazmierczak, had the sort of online posting history that you would expect and had told a neighbor that he might be arrested at an upcoming Omar event. He was charged with assault, and the liquid was determined to be apple cider vinegar and water. This story about his life is sad.

Omar was direct in pinning blame for the incident. “What the facts have shown since I’ve gotten into elected office,” she said Wednesday, “is that every time the president of the United States has chosen to use hateful rhetoric to talk about me and the community that I represent, my death threats skyrocket.” Indeed, Trump has directed years of racist invective toward Ilhan Omar, all of which has taken on a new acuity as the administration targets the Minnesota Somali community in general. The incident did not prompt a change of heart in Trump’s rhetoric toward Omar. “I think she’s a fraud,” he told ABC News. “I really don’t think about that. She probably had herself sprayed, knowing her.”

Lawyers love legal reasoning. It promises a clean, clear path through sticky, tricky territory. But legal reasoning can enable grotesque real-world outcomes, like torture, or arresting journalists, or masked government agents detaining and disappearing people. On this week’s Amicus, Dahlia Lithwick is in conversation with Joseph Margulies, Professor of Practice of Government at Cornell University. Margulies litigated some of the biggest cases of egregious human rights violations of the post-9/11 “War on Terror”, an experience that informed his recent piece in the Boston Review: The Moral Stupefaction of America. Margulies explains how, when we allow obscure legal language to overshadow moral imperatives, we can end up in very dark places. The line from waterboarding at black sites to executing American citizens in the streets is a straight one. And there will be a lawyer willing to write a memo for all of it.

Why is the Trump administration arresting journalists and activists over a protest inside a Minnesota church? The official reason the government cited Friday—when it arrested independent journalists Don Lemon and Georgia Fort, as well as two others—was that they were part of a “coordinated attack” on Cities Church in St. Paul. It’s a strange claim: Videos from the incident, which occurred Jan. 18, showed protesters being loud in interrupting a worship service, but not physically touching anyone or damaging any property. The protest may have been unpleasant for those in the pews—videos showed at least one man haranguing people for their complicity in supporting ICE—but it’s hardly an “attack.”

The incident has, however, gone viral in conservative media—proof positive of the degeneracy of the Minnesota protesters and yet another example of the left’s anti-Christian bigotry. Critics of the protest portrayed it as an intrusion of vulgar politics into a sacred refuge from daily life, a faceoff between vicious activists and apolitical (and bewildered) parishioners. For an administration obsessed with firing up its base supporters, arresting participants has an obvious political use. That’s especially true of Lemon, who because of his former job at CNN is a household name and much-reviled figure on the right.

But this isn’t just a case of red meat for the base. These activists have, perhaps inadvertently, come up against some very well-connected people. Despite efforts to portray it as an apolitical island of faith, Cities Church has extensive ties to a deeply political network within the larger Christian nationalism movement—a network with ties to the upper echelons of the Trump administration.

Some of the connections are obvious: The protest was aimed at an Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent who served as a lay pastor at the church. The pastor, David Easterwood, was not an employee of the church but one of a number of elders in it. He serves as the field officer for ICE’s operations in St. Paul and has appeared publicly with Kristi Noem. And Cities Church’s lead pastor, Jonathan Parnell, primarily preaches of standard Biblical matters, but he’s not above politics—or broadcasting about it on social media. He has discussed the evils of “transgenderism” and called the pope an “idiot.”

But the more important ties go deeper. Cities Church was founded 11 years ago by a group of theologically conservative men, including a pastor named Joe Rigney. Rigney is no longer a pastor at Cities Church, but he still speaks for it in conservative media appearances. “This is not a political church,” he told Fox News’ Martha MacCallum. “This is a church that worships Jesus. Loves one another. Seeks the good of their neighbors.”

“It’s a normal congregation of Christian worshippers,” he said on a separate Fox News segment, speaking to Harris Faulkner. “Every town in this country is filled with people like this who want to worship Jesus, love one another, serve their neighbor, seek the good of these cities.”

But Rigney himself is focused on much more than worshiping Jesus and loving one another. Rigney is currently a pastor of Christ Church in Moscow, Idaho. Christ Church is an extremely controversial church, known for essentially taking over the town as part of a religious effort led by a pastor named Doug Wilson. Wilson’s Communion of Reformed Evangelical Churches have hard-right views on women’s rights, including opposition to women’s suffrage. Wilson has also begun an effort to expand his sphere of influence into Washington: He opened a second campus of Christ Church in D.C. in 2025 with the explicit goal of molding powerful Republicans. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth attends a church affiliated with the network.

“With the change in administration, we believe that there will be many strategic opportunities with numerous evangelicals who will be present both in and around the Trump administration,” Wilson wrote in a blog post at the time. “These believers are obviously culturally engaged already, but we happen to believe that every form of cultural engagement needs to have a solid theological foundation and support, and we want to help to provide it.”

Rigney, as part of this movement, is a highly political figure. He comments on partisan politics on social media, calling, for example, to end Obergefell, the Supreme Court ruling that legalized gay marriage. He has written an entire book criticizing “the sin of empathy.” He has appeared on chummy podcasts with William Wolfe, a Baptist activist and author who wrote of Alex Pretti’s killing: “Another foolish person has lost their life trying to obstruct ICE. Here’s my reaction: I don’t care.”

There’s a legitimate debate over how to treat worship spaces in a time of encroaching authoritarianism. But in its discussion of the church protest, conservative media—and now the Trump administration—have presented it as a struggle between leftists and apolitical Christians. That’s a lie: The conversation around the St. Paul church protest should not assume political intentions on just one side.

In the wake of the killings of Renee Good and Alex Pretti during Trump’s immigration enforcement surge in Minnesota, the closest thing to “accountability” we’ve seen is Border Patrol’s Gregory Bovino being sent back to California. It’s not enough but it’s something.

Late Thursday night, former CNN anchor Don Lemon was arrested by federal agents at the direction of Attorney General Pam Bondi. Independent journalist Georgia Fort was arrested as well, along with activists Trahern Jeen Crews and Jamael Lydell Lundy. The arrests stem from a protest at Cities Church in St. Paul, Minnesota, where the pastor is also an Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent. Protesters entered the church chanting “ICE out,” disrupting services. Troubling though this may be—places of worship have often been considered off-limits for political protest—the protesters did not assault anyone or even destroy property. Whatever protesters did or didn’t do, Lemon was not demonstrating; he identified himself as a journalist and was clear he was documenting the protest, not participating in it. These arrests came after the Trump Department of Justice’s original criminal complaint against Lemon was rejected because a federal judge—a man who was a former clerk for conservative icon Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia and a George W. Bush appointee—found there was no probable cause to arrest him.

Still, Lemon found himself under arrest for the crime of doing journalism. The White House tweeted out: “When life gets you lemons…” followed by two chain emojis and an image of Lemon, accusing him of “involvement in the St. Paul church riots.”

Even for an administration that has spent a year violating the First Amendment in all kinds of novel ways, the arrest of a prominent journalist is a shock—a five-alarm fire moment.

It also shows just how far this administration is willing to go to solidify its control. And it raises the question of just how far Donald Trump’s most loyal followers will follow him. Already, some of them have ceded their fealty to their most valued constitutional amendment—not the First, but the Second. And that willingness to quickly shake off once-sacrosanct beliefs does not bode well for all of our freedoms to speak, protest, and publish.

The Second Amendment, conservatives and Supreme Court justices have complained, is a “disfavored right.” In arguments earlier this month over a Hawaii gun law that limited the ability of people to carry a concealed weapon onto private property, Chief Justice John Roberts asked Neal Katyal, the attorney for the state of Hawaii, why a political candidate door-knocking could under the First Amendment approach private homes and make his case, but under Hawaii’s law couldn’t do so with a gun on him. The conservative justices seemed largely united in their view that the Second Amendment allows an expansive individual right to carry a firearm—a right that is just as expansive as the First Amendment’s protections of free speech and assembly.

Just days after those oral arguments, Alex Pretti was shot multiple times by Customs and Border Protection agents. The conservative reaction to his killing has raised important questions of just how much the right actually cares about gun rights, if the person exercising those rights is a liberal. But it’s raised even more important, and less-discussed, questions about the First Amendment, and the troubling ways in which the rights to speak and protest are being aggressively eroded by this administration and its supporters—including the one-time self-styled conservative warriors for free speech.

This administration’s about-face on the Second Amendment has rightly merited accusations of hypocrisy, and has signaled the willingness of its followers to again relinquish a once-foundational principle out of unbroken loyalty to their Dear Leader. In reality, though, this administration is not going to strip gun rights away from American citizens—at least not those who support the MAGA movement. Despite Trump’s complaints about guns at anti-ICE actions, the legal interpretations of the Second Amendment will likely only grow more ludicrously capacious under this regime.

The First Amendment, though, is a different matter. And it’s the rights within it—to assemble, to speak, to protest, to practice one’s religion, to petition one’s government, to a free press—that are quickly becoming, to both paraphrase Roberts and understate the urgency of the matter, disfavored.

In Minneapolis, Pretti’s gun was holstered. He wasn’t wielding it or intimidating anyone with it, let alone threatening anyone’s life. The Trump administration has nevertheless branded him a “domestic terrorist” and a “would-be assassin.” They have suggested that any opponent of the administration who peacefully exercises their Second Amendment right might forfeit their right to life.

And even more troubling: The administration and its agents are arguing that opponents might lose their lives or their liberty for peacefully exercising their First Amendment rights.

“When politicians, community leaders, and some journalists engage in that heated rhetoric we keep talking about, when they make the choice to vilify law enforcement, calling law enforcement names like Gestapo or using the term kidnapping, that is a choice that has made their actions and consequences that come from those choices,” Border Patrol commander-at-large Greg Bovino said in a press conference over the weekend. “When someone chooses to listen to a politician, a so-called journalist, or a community leader that spouts that type of vilification towards law enforcement or anything else … there are consequences and actions there also, I think we saw that yesterday.”

The “consequences” he’s referring to: Alex Pretti’s death.

Bovino is not the only administration official who has implied that the consequences for free speech might be death. “For months, we’ve been warning politicians and the media to tone down their rhetoric about ICE law enforcement before someone was killed,” Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said in early January. “This shooting must serve as a wake-up call to the far left that their rhetoric about ICE has consequences. Comparing ICE day in and day out to the Nazi Gestapo, the Secret Police, and slave patrols has consequences.”

Last summer, DHS Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs Tricia McLaughlin claimed that “videotaping ICE law enforcement and posting photos and videos of them online is doxing our agents” and threatened to “prosecute those who illegally harass ICE agents to the fullest extent of the law” (photographing and videotaping law enforcement in public is legally protected behavior). Noem defined as “violence” “anything that threatens [DHS agents] and their safety. It is doxing them. It is videotaping them where they’re at.”

White House border czar Tom Homan also blamed “the rhetoric,” not trigger-happy agents, for violence against demonstrators. “I said in March—if the rhetoric doesn’t stop, there is gonna be bloodshed,” he said at a press conference on Thursday. “And there has been.” What Homan actually said back in March was this: “Do I expect violence to escalate? Absolutely.” In February, he warned, “I’m coming to Boston and I’m bringing Hell with me.” Over the summer, he publicly fantasized about beating up a Democratic member of Congress.

In his most recent press conference, Homan referred to ICE agents in Minneapolis as being in “theater”—a term usually used for a region to which soldiers are deployed in combat.

ICE and Customs and Border Patrol agents seem to have gotten the message that they are at war, that the penalty for speech they don’t like might be death, and that they have free rein to assault or even kill those who offend, challenge, or simply just annoy them. “You raise your voice, I erase your voice,” one officer is seen on video saying to an observer. “Listen, have y’all not learned from the past couple of days?” another agent asked citizens who were (legally) filming him in public soon after the Renee Good killing. “Have you not learned?” Agents have, without charges, been detaining witnesses to their violence, it seems to simply intimidate them into shutting up. Yet another federal agent told a woman filming him, “We have a nice little database and now you’re considered a domestic terrorist.”

After Good’s killing, Trump threatened to invoke the Insurrection Act “if the corrupt politicians of Minnesota don’t obey the law and stop the professional agitators and insurrectionists from attacking the Patriots of I.C.E.” Members of his administration have defined “attacking” ICE as filming them, alerting the public to their presence, or calling them fascists—all protected forms of speech, protest, and expression. Right-wing members of the House have renewed calls for the use of the Insurrection Act in the wake of Pretti’s killing. The Insurrection Act would allow Trump to put U.S. soldiers on the streets, and while it does not impose martial law or formally suspend the civil liberties guaranteed to Americans by the Constitution, it is an enormous escalation that treats protesters as domestic enemies. It would almost surely curtail civil liberties by default, if not by law. And while it briefly seemed that Trump and administration officials had somewhat cooled their rhetoric in the wake of a mass publish backlash over the Pretti killing, their arrest of Lemon suggests that they’ve again changed tactics—and that they remain willing to bring the full force of the federal government down on U.S. citizens simply for exercising their First Amendment rights.

This is all coming in the context of an administration that has been more overtly hostile to the First Amendment rights of free speech and expression than any in modern history. The FBI recently searched the home of Washington Post reporter Hannah Natanson, claiming they were looking for “illegal leaks”; Natanson had been reporting on the administration’s gutting of the federal workforce. Tufts University student Rümeysa Öztürk was walking home when masked federal agents grabbed her off of the street, forced her into a van, and ferried her off to a detention center thousands of miles away where they continued deportation proceedings against her—not because she had broken the law, but because the government didn’t like the content of a pro-Palestinian op-ed she wrote. Emmy Award–winning journalist Mario Guevara, who spent two decades covering immigration and the Latino community in Atlanta and had a valid work permit, was arrested by ICE, detained for more than 100 days, and eventually deported to El Salvador. The administration claimed Guevara’s filming of ICE officers—his reporting—constituted a risk to public safety. Retired police officer Larry Bushart of Tennessee was arrested and jailed for more than a month over a Facebook post about Charlie Kirk (the post quoted Trump saying “we have to get over it” about a school shooting).

The existing infringements on the First Amendment have been bad. But what this administration is signaling may be coming could be much worse.

Back in September, the White House released a memo promising to crack down on “domestic terrorism,” which they say is “under the umbrella of self-described ‘anti-fascism.’ ” When it comes to anti-fascism, the memo says, “Common threads animating this violent conduct include anti-Americanism, anti-capitalism, and anti-Christianity; support for the overthrow of the United States Government; extremism on migration, race, and gender; and hostility towards those who hold traditional American views on family, religion, and morality.” Acts of domestic terrorism, they say, include “doxing”—which the administration has defined as simply identifying an ICE officer—and “civil disorder,” by which they mean protest.

Many conservatives spent the whole of the Biden administration crowing about infringements on their First Amendment rights—the wokescolds who wouldn’t let them use racial slurs anymore, the tyrannical government that set limits on public gatherings in the midst of a deadly pandemic. Now that their side is in charge, though, any commitment to the freedoms of speech and assembly seems to have evaporated in favor of retribution and crushing the opposition. This is exceedingly dangerous: Rights are meaningless if the only people who have them are those the regime believes will submit.

Liberals should hope that the administration’s willingness to infringe upon Second Amendment freedoms will be a wake-up call to the gun-obsessed right. Maybe threats to the Second Amendment, even if they’re largely rhetorical, will make a few conservatives take notice of how this regime is on a mission to actually obliterate the First.

            <h2>Broadcom 'bulldozes' VMware cloud partners as March deadline looms</h2>
            <p><strong>The Register | 2026-01-31</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2026/01/31/broadcom_vmware_cloud_partners/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">exclusive Broadcom this week brought the hammer down on the Advantage Partner Program for VMware Cloud Service Providers (VCSPs) – and the clock is now ticking for any third parties working to close sales.

For customers, this potentially represents a massive supplier shake-up, with sources claiming that hundreds of CSPs across Europe are affected.

The news may not come as a shock to Reg readers because the direction of travel was indicated when Broadcom shuttered VMware&#39;s reseller/solution provider schemes in early 2024 and moved to the invite-only Broadcom Advantage Partner Program. Broadcom has also started to license new bundles, including products previously sold as standalone, and altered support for perpetual license holders.

Dramatic changes also hit cloud service providers. Broadcom gave notice on October 31 that it was phasing out the VCSP program and sunsetting the White Label model for partners in the European Economic Area. It is now moving to an invite-only model with fewer authorized providers and this week informed affected partners.

On Monday, in a non-renewal email seen by The Register, Broadcom said: &quot;We are providing this formal notice that we have closed the current Broadcom Advantage Partner Program for VMware Cloud Service Provider (VCSP) partners, and will not be renewing any of your VCSP partner contracts with Broadcom after 26 January 2026.&quot;

&quot;You may continue to transact new and existing coterminous customer opportunities through the end of your current commitment contract term. The term for any new contracts executed during this period must be coterminous with a current active commitment contract that you have with Broadcom. However, we encourage you to close any open opportunities you may be pursuing by 31 March 2026.&quot;

In an FAQ document also seen by El Reg, Broadcom said the reason for not continuing with certain authorized VCSPs pertains to &quot;evolving customer requirements&quot; – it didn&#39;t specify what these are – and to &quot;enable increased adoption of VMware Cloud Foundation as the core private cloud platform.&quot; This means Broadcom needs to &quot;work more closely with a focused set of partners.&quot;

CSPs may &quot;execute&quot; new coterminous customer contracts and keep servicing existing customers under VCSP commitments for the remainder of the contract terms with Broadcom, their Cloud Commerce Manager, or their Primary White Label Provider partners.

&quot;You may not execute any new Aggregate commitment contracts nor any renewals for existing commitment contracts, so that a timely and orderly wind-down of the current Program can become effective at the end of your existing commitment contract term(s),&quot; the notice states.

The Cloud Infrastructure Service Providers of Europe trade group (CISPE), which is pressing the European Commission to overturn its approval of Broadcom&#39;s buy of VMware on antitrust grounds, was damning of the January 26 notification. One of its members, Estonia-based WaveCom, said it has invested in VMware for 15 years.

Kristian Liivak, CTO and founder of WaveCom AS, said a &quot;bulldozer named Broadcom&quot; has &quot;finally rolled over the remaining EU cloud service providers, terminating almost all VMware partner contracts.&quot;

&quot;This process had already taken place elsewhere in the world. In the United States, for example, only 19 providers reportedly remain out of thousands. Now the same approach has reached Europe.&quot;

Liivak said VMware, under Broadcom&#39;s ownership, has &quot;dismantled&quot; the partner network, beginning with &quot;predatory contractual terms and aggressive pricing changes.&quot; He claimed the &quot;long onboarding queues of enterprise customers disappeared almost overnight.&quot;

WaveCom previously started to build a virtualization stack based on Apache CloudStack and the EU-based Vates and Xen.

&quot;We still carry long-term government procurement obligations and enterprise contracts. It remains unclear how all customers will transition – whether they will move with us to the new platform or whether contractual challenges will arise due to the forced termination of the VMware ecosystem.&quot;

In its FAQ document, Broadcom covered what happens to customers managed by a non-renewing partner, saying: &quot;Non-renewing partners are encouraged to engage with retained VCSP partners to ensure a smooth transition for customers.&quot;

Liivak said: &quot;We will not disappear quietly into the night. And we will not hand our customers over to the remaining few providers, as implied by Broadcom&#39;s termination notice.&quot;

Another CSP source told us: &quot;This isn&#39;t partner management, it&#39;s market control, a forced consolidation that sidelines long-standing European partners in favor of a much narrower and more limiting ecosystem. Broadcom is deliberately shrinking the choice for customers who will end up paying the price through higher costs, less data sovereignty, compliance concerns, and ultimately reduced choice.&quot;

The Register has asked Broadcom to comment on how many CSPs will be joining its invite-only channel program, how many were not renewed and what if customers don&#39;t want to move to a new supplier.

&quot;Broadcom&#39;s strategy since closing the VMware acquisition has been to drive simplification, consistency, and innovation across the VMware ecosystem, including VMware Cloud Services Providers (VCSPs). Recent changes to this ecosystem are consistent with this strategy. Broadcom is focusing more and going deeper with the VCSPs who have demonstrated commitment to their cloud services built on VMware. This will enable us to deliver greater value, stronger execution, and a more streamlined experience for Broadcom&#39;s customers and enable an alternative competitive offering to the hyperscalers through our VCSP partners.&quot; ®

            <h2>January blues return as Ivanti coughs up exploited EPMM zero-days</h2>
            <p><strong>The Register | 2026-01-30</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2026/01/30/ivanti_epmm_zero_days/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Ivanti has patched two critical zero-day vulnerabilities in its Endpoint Manager Mobile (EPMM) product that are already being exploited, continuing a grim run of January security incidents for enterprise IT vendors.

In January 2025, tens of thousands were urged to patch a Fortinet zero-day, while Ivanti customers were doing the same. There has been little change this year as Fortinet patches multiple single sign-on (SSO) flaws and Ivanti ships fixes for yet another pair of zero-days.

Tracked as CVE-2026-1281 and CVE-2026-1340, both bugs affect Ivanti Endpoint Manager Mobile (EPMM). They&#39;re also both rated a near-maximum CVSS score of 9.8 and allow for unauthenticated remote code execution (RCE) – about as bad as it gets.

The security shop said in its advisory: &quot;We are aware of a very limited number of customers whose solution has been exploited at the time of disclosure.

&quot;This vulnerability does not impact any other Ivanti products, including any cloud products, such as Ivanti Neurons for MDM. Ivanti Endpoint Manager (EPM) is a different product and also not impacted by these vulnerabilities. Customers using an Ivanti cloud product with Sentry are also not impacted by this vulnerability.&quot;

These kinds of RCE bugs can lead to all sorts of nastiness. Lateral movement across a given organization&#39;s network, config changes, and attackers making themselves admin are all possible. The vendor warned that it could grant access to certain data too.

Ivanti said that the types of information available could include basic personal information about the EPMM admin and device user, as well as information about mobile devices such as phone numbers and GPS locations.

Those looking for indicators of compromise (IOCs) are out of luck. Ivanti doesn&#39;t have any reliable ones due to the small number of impacted customers it knows about.

It does, however, have a technical analysis page, which includes more general information about how to detect potential exploits.

The Apache access log is a good place to start for threat hunters. Specifically, they should be looking at the In-House Application Distribution and the Android File Transfer Configuration features. Legitimate traffic leads to 200 HTTP response codes while potential exploit activity may result in 404s.

&quot;We recommend reviewing these and any other GET requests with parameters that have bash commands,&quot; Ivanti said.

This is not the first time in recent memory that EPMM has been hit by RCE bugs, and previous analyses have shown attackers tend to use two common methods of persistence. More often than not, it&#39;s introducing or modifying web shells, typically targeting error pages such as 401.jsp, the vendor said.

&quot;Any requests to these pages with POST methods or with parameters should be considered highly suspicious.&quot;

Ivanti also advised defenders to look out for unexpected WAR or JAR files being introduced to the system, as it could be a sign of attackers deploying reverse shell connections.

EPMM also does not usually make outbound network connections, so any signs of this in the firewall logs should be treated as a sign to investigate.

If a customer does find signs of compromise, Ivanti said it&#39;s best to just restore from backups – don&#39;t bother trying to clean the system – and then upgrade to the latest relevant version.

Alternatively, if going down the backup route isn&#39;t an option, Ivanti suggests building a replacement EPMM device and migrating data onto it.

Benjamin Harris, CEO at watchTowr, said that a &quot;wide range&quot; of its customers who have EPMM running belong to high-value industries, warning others to act fast.

He said: &quot;We knew January seemed too calm. Ivanti&#39;s EPMM solution, the center point of previous zero-day sagas, is once again receiving in-the-wild exploitation by seemingly capable and well-resourced threat actors.

&quot;CVE-2026-1281 and CVE-2026-1340 – unauthenticated RCE vulnerabilities within Ivanti&#39;s Endpoint Manager Mobile (EPMM) – represent the worst of the worst, with threat actors actively compromising systems and deploying backdoors.

&quot;While patches are available from Ivanti, applying patches will not be enough. Threat actors have been exploiting these vulnerabilities as zero-days, and organizations that are, as of disclosure, exposing vulnerable instances to the internet must consider them compromised, tear down infrastructure, and instigate incident response processes.&quot; ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Lying means dying, at least for one falsehood-peddling government AI. A Microsoft-powered chatbot that New York City rolled out to help business owners answer frequently asked questions – but was often wrong – has been silenced as the city grapples with a $12 billion budget shortfall.

Mayor Zohran Mamdani said that, while the cash saved is only a fraction of what is needed to fund the budget, it was emblematic of how the last administration spent taxpayer money.

“The previous administration had an AI chatbot that was functionally unusable, and was costing the administration around a half a million dollars,” Mamdani said in a Wednesday press conference. “That in and of itself is not something that can bridge this gap, but it’s an indication of the ways in which money has been spent while refusing to account for the actual costs of what these programs are.”

The chatbot was announced in October 2023 as part of then-Mayor Eric Adams&#39; New York City Artificial Intelligence Action Plan. It was meant to give business owners and entrepreneurs actionable and trusted information from more than 2,000 NYC business web pages and articles on topics such as compliance with codes and regulations, available business incentives, and best practices to avoid violations and fines, Adams said at the time.

“For the first time New York City business and aspiring entrepreneurs will be able to direct their questions to an AI-powered chatbot rather than having to scan through webpage after webpage going into the blackhole of uncertainty about how to open a business, how to run a business, how to answer some of the basic questions,” he said during the announcement. “That is behind us. AI-generated answering is in front of us.”

However local news outlet The Markup tested the bot, it gave questioners the wrong answers, telling would-be landlords they did not have to accept tenants on housing assistance, and that they could set rents as high as they wished.

It said businesses could go cashless, even though the city council passed a measure in 2020 that required businesses to accept cash, and that it was ok for businesses to take employees&#39; tips and to conceal some funeral costs.

While the city did say in 2023 that the bot may hallucinate, the new administration credited the news outlet for alerting it to the problematic bot. The Register reached out to Microsoft for comment on Friday afternoon but did not receive an immediate response.

The New York bot isn’t the first one to run amok.

Air Canada used an AI-powered chatbot that gave the wrong advice about discounts, while other chatbots are accused of being complicit in harm to children, including suicide.

A Canadian tribunal found that Air Canada was bound by what its bot said. Earlier this month, Google and Character AI offered to settle lawsuits brought by families in Florida, Colorado, New York, and Texas whose children either died or were harmed after interactions with those bots. ®

            <h2>Ex-Googler nailed for stealing AI secrets for Chinese startups</h2>

            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2026/01/30/google_engineer_convicted_ai_secrets_china/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">A former Google software engineer has been convicted of stealing AI hardware secrets from the company for the benefit of two China-based firms, one of which he founded. The second startup intended to use these secrets to market its technology to PRC-controlled organizations.

On Thursday, Linwei (&quot;Leon&quot;) Ding, 38, was convicted on seven counts of economic espionage and seven counts of trade secret theft for stealing confidential information related to Google&#39;s Tensor Processing Units (TPUs), Graphics Processing Units (GPUs), and SmartNIC network interface cards.

&quot;We&#39;re grateful to the jury for making sure justice was served today, sending a clear message that stealing trade secrets has serious consequences,&quot; said Lee-Anne Mulholland, VP of regulatory affairs at Google, in a statement provided to The Register.

According to the second superseding indictment [PDF] filed in September 2025, Ding began working for Google on May 13, 2019. He was responsible for developing software that helps GPUs function more efficiently for machine learning applications at Google and Google Cloud. In that role, he had access to information Google deemed confidential.

Google employs various physical and network security measures, including security guards, cameras at building entrances, badge-based building access restrictions, guest registration and accompaniment requirements, network data loss prevention monitoring, device identification and authentication, and network activity logging.

The company checks physical and network access activity using both automated tools and human review to flag discrepancies like network access via an IP address that doesn&#39;t match the location of the employee&#39;s access badge.

These measures later helped reconstruct Ding&#39;s activities for investigators, but did not prevent or immediately detect his initial data theft. Google&#39;s spokesperson did not respond when asked whether the company has revised its security procedures and policies in the wake of this incident.

Around May 21, 2022, Ding began uploading more than 1,000 files containing trade secrets to his personal Google Cloud account.

&quot;Ding exfiltrated these files by copying data from the Google source files into the Apple Notes application on his Google-issued MacBook laptop,&quot; the indictment states. &quot;Ding then converted the Apple Notes into PDF files and uploaded them from the Google network into [his personal Google Cloud account]. This method helped Ding evade immediate detection by Google.&quot;

The following month, June 2022, Ding received a series of email messages from the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of Beijing Rongshu Lianzhi Technology Co., Ltd. (&quot;Rongshu&quot;), a technology startup in China focused on machine learning acceleration. The messages included a job offer as CTO for 100,000 RMB per month, which was worth about $14,800 or $177,600 annually at the time, plus an annual bonus and company stock.

Ding traveled to China on October 29, 2022, staying there until March 25, 2023, during which time he participated in investor meetings to raise money for Rongshu. By May 30, 2023, according to the indictment, he founded Shanghai Zhisuan Technology Co. Ltd. (&quot;Zhisuan&quot;) and took the role of CEO. The company aimed to develop a Cluster Management System for accelerating machine learning workloads.

Ding applied to get Zhisuan into a China-based business incubation program called MiraclePlus. The company was accepted in November 2023 and Ding then traveled to Beijing to pitch investors.

A document he distributed around that time in a Zhisuan WeChat group noted, &quot;we have experience with Google&#39;s ten-thousand-card computational power platform; we just need to replicate and upgrade it – and then further develop a computational power platform suited to China&#39;s national conditions.&quot; An internal Zhisuan memo referenced in the indictment indicates that the company expected to market its technology to PRC-controlled entities, including government agencies and academic institutions.

Google became aware of Ding&#39;s activities when he uploaded further files to a second personal Google Drive account while he was in China. On December 8, 2023, Ding offered reassurance to a Google investigator about his use of a personal account and signed a Self-Deletion Affidavit stating that he hasn&#39;t retained any Google information – while not disclosing his prior use of a personal account to upload Google files.

On December 14, 2023, Ding booked a one-way ticket from San Francisco to Beijing, scheduled to depart January 7, 2024. On December 26, 2023, he emailed his manager to resign from Google.

Three days later, Google found out that Ding had presented at the MiraclePlus conference as the CEO of Zhisuan. Company investigators then suspended Ding&#39;s network access, remotely locked his Google laptop, and began reviewing various security records.

They found surveillance footage that showed another employee scanning Ding&#39;s building access badge earlier that month to make it seem as if Ding was in the US during dates he was in China.

On January 4, 2024, Google security personnel took Ding&#39;s Google laptop and mobile device. Two days later, FBI investigators executed a search warrant. A grand jury indictment [PDF] was returned on March 5, 2024.

The court filings do not say whether the stolen trade secrets remain in the hands of PRC-affiliated individuals or companies. Google&#39;s spokesperson did not respond to a request to elaborate on the status of its proprietary information.

Ding&#39;s defense attorney filed a motion [PDF] to have the case dismissed, arguing that the government failed to allege that Ding ever handed the stolen secrets over to a foreign government entity; that he intended or knew his actions would benefit the PRC; or that the espionage was backed by the PRC.

Judge Chhabria subsequently rejected the defense motion, finding that the allegations and evidence were sufficient for a trial. He did however express skepticism of the government&#39;s theories that Ding&#39;s actions qualify as economic espionage under 18 U.S. Code § 1831 if they benefit China as a country, as opposed to the government of China.

According to the US Justice Department, trial evidence &quot;showed that Ding intended to benefit two entities controlled by the government of China by assisting with the development of an AI supercomputer and collaborating on the research and development of custom machine learning chips.&quot;

The jury found the government&#39;s case convincing and voted unanimously to convict on all fourteen counts. Ding faces a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison for each count of trade secret theft and 15 years in prison for each count of economic espionage, subject to US Sentencing Guidelines and federal sentencing rules. ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Thousands more Oregonians will soon receive data breach letters in the continued fallout from the TriZetto data breach, in which someone hacked the insurance verification provider and gained access to its healthcare provider customers across multiple US states.

The breach occurred back in November 2024, with intruders snooping through protected health information and other sensitive personal information belonging to hundreds of thousands of patients and insurance policy holders. TriZetto Provider Solutions (TPS) did not discover the digital thieves on their network until almost a year later.

&quot;TPS reports that the threat was eliminated on Oct. 2, 2025, and may have exposed the PHI of more than 700,000 people,&quot; according to a Thursday advisory from Deschutes County Health Services, Best Care, and the La Pine Community Health Center, all of which serve patients across Central Oregon.

The three Oregon medical providers, along with those in Massachusetts, Oklahoma, and dozens of other healthcare clinics in California were notified in early December 2025.

Deschutes County said about 1,300 patients were affected, La Pine will notify about 1,200, and Best Care will notify about 1,650 that their health information was exposed. The healthcare orgs say there&#39;s no evidence at this time that people&#39;s info has been misused - such as for medical fraud and identity theft scams - and no financial details were stolen in the breach.

Cognizant, which owns TriZetto, has been hit with multiple class action lawsuits as a result of the compromise.

&quot;On October 2, TPS became aware of suspicious activity within a web portal that some of TPS’s healthcare provider customers use to access our systems,&quot; Cognizant told The Register. &quot;We quickly launched an investigation, took steps to mitigate the issue, and eliminated the threat to the environment. We have also engaged external cybersecurity experts, Mandiant, and notified law enforcement. We have notified affected customers and patients and provided them with the support and the information they need. This was not a ransom incident.&quot;

This is not the first time Cognizant has ended up in court over its security practices - or lack thereof.

In July, Clorox sued Cognizant, its service desk provider, for $380 million in a California state court over a 2023 cyberattack in which the IT support crew allegedly &quot;enabled a cybercriminal to gain a foothold in Clorox&#39;s network&quot; by handing over staffers&#39; passwords to attackers after they simply requested them. ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Tax season 2026 could be an interesting one as the IRS seeks to replace the staff it sent to the unemployment line with AI. Bots could handle tasks ranging from reviewing an org&#39;s request for tax-exempt status to processing amended individual filings.

The Treasury Department, the IRS&#39; parent agency, published its latest AI use case inventory this week, which includes 129 items, 61 of which are specific to the IRS. That&#39;s a considerable increase from 2024, when the whole of the Treasury said it was working on just 54 AI use cases, 49 of which were IRS specific.

It&#39;s been known that the Treasury Department had been slashing IRS staff since Trump took office about a year ago and had plans to replace eliminated staff with AI - Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent even said as much in May when asked by Congress, suggesting that the &quot;AI boom&quot; could offset staffing cuts without hurting collections.

&quot;I believe through smarter IT, through this AI boom, that we can use that to enhance collections,&quot; Bessent told the House Appropriations Committee last year when asked whether staff cuts at the agency would imperil the 2026 filing season. &quot;I expect collections would continue to be very robust as they were this year.&quot;

A considerable portion of the IRS staff eliminated in 2025 came from the IT department, which Treasury watchdog data released last summer showed had lost about 25 percent of its workforce amid wider cuts.

Given that, it&#39;s not entirely unsurprising that 16 of the 61 IRS AI use cases identified in the latest Treasury AI inventory are information technology ones.

Among the IT use cases the IRS has identified are a machine learning model designed to process tax-exempt organization annual reports, a coding assistant, support ticket management, multiple internal research tools, and software aimed at eliminating paper documents.

Outside of IT-specific use cases, the IRS is also fielding AI to help it process corporate and individual amended tax filings, interact with taxpayers through various function-specific chatbots, verify identities, digitize forms, and analyze customer service instances. Internally, the IRS is either using or plans to use AI to rank resumes, support employees through more chatbots, and assist in procurement, among other functions.

Despite Bessent&#39;s claim last year that the IRS would be specifically using AI to aid in its collections process, and a specific mention of a &quot;collections chatbot&quot; in the 2024 use case document that suggests the bot was already in operation, it appears that particular AI use case ran its course. There&#39;s no mention of AI being used for tax collection in the new use case document at all.

The Treasury Department didn&#39;t respond to questions for this story. ®

FujiFilm’s Instax Mini Link 3 printer is a much-loved $100 accessory in my travel journal kit. I often tape a printed image next to my handwritten thoughts to preserve a moment in time. The prints produced by the instant film can, however, be soft and muddy — something the new $169.95 Instax Mini Link+ promises to improve.

The big upgrade is a new Design Print mode. It’s supposed to make text and intricate illustrations crisp and legible, but I didn’t see much of an improvement, despite that being a big selling point. I did, however, find that the improved processing inside the Mini Link+ enhanced contrast, colors, and sharpness, to reveal more details in a wide variety of photos, and I think that’s more important to most people.

From my testing, the new Mini Link+ is definitely an upgrade, but don’t expect this, or any instant film Instax printer to perform miracles, especially for images measuring just 62 x 46mm (2.44 x 1.81 inches).

Best Instax Mini printer yetImproved colors, sharpness, and contrast on most photosFun for creatives

Little improvement on text heavy illustrationsExpensiveApp is overwrought

FujiFilm’s Instax printers all use its Instax Mini instant film which typically costs around $30 for 20 sheets, or about $1.50 per photo. To print, you need to download the “Instax Mini Link” app available for both iOS and Android.

The app is overwrought with features that let you visualize your photos in real space with VR and use the printer as a remote camera shutter. It also helps you organize your images; imagine your prints in frames, on shelves, or as a collage taped to the wall; and prettify them with text, stickers, and filters. You can even connect your Pinterest account if you want. Fun, I suppose, but I’m not twelve-years old – I’m a full-grown man, damnit, and I just want to print photos in my iPhone’s photo library, and do it quickly!

To do that, I have to first import the image into the Instax Mini Link app, hit print, choose either the Simple or Design mode, then wait 20 seconds for the printout. Simple print promises “smooth color tones for everyday images” and produces softer images that, in general, are still an improvement over most anything the Mini Link 3 can print. Design mode is exclusive to the Mini Link+ and the reason you might want it.

I tested the different modes with a variety of images and generally found Design prints made on the Mini Link+ were superior for faces, landscapes, high contrast images, and macro shots of nature. Everything, really, other than text-heavy illustrations, where I saw no obvious improvement.

For example, look at my stupid face. Photos with intense lighting were susceptible to blowout when printed on the older Mini Link 3. The Simple and Design prints from the Mini Link+ handled the lighting better, with improved contrast, more detail in the eye, and more accurate colors and skin texture.

In the example above, everything in the Mini Link 3 print is super soft and blends together in a muddled mess. The Mini Link+ again offers improved contrast, with visible textures on the rock faces, tree branches, and improved colors throughout. The wooden slats on the barn, lines of individual trees, and wheel detail are more pronounced on the Design print, with less saturation on that big pine to the left.

Here, the Mini Link 3 struggles to depict the snow as anything but a white smear, while you can make out individual snowflakes and depth on the Mini Link+ Design print.

In this example, the Mini Link 3 really flattens the sky and removes the texture from the distant mountain. The greens and blues are more brilliant with the Simple and Design prints, while the separation between bits of gravel and blades of grass is more apparent in Design mode.

In this Spotify screenshot, Design mode sharpens the lettering and artificially enhances the white text with a black outline, most visible on the letters “a” and “s.” Simple mode doesn’t do this. The outlining does make the lettering pop.

I find surprisingly little difference between these illustrations printed by the Mini Link 3 and the Mini Link+, even in Design mode. Strange because this is where FujiFilm’s new printer is supposed to excel. Nevertheless, they all look good enough for hobbyists, and anyone looking to spice up a journal or decorate a room.

After printing 15 photos over the last few days, the battery on the Instax Mini Link+ is still at 80 percent. The battery charges over USB-C, and, if you’re in Europe, the FujiFilm NP-70S battery can be user-replaced when it no longer holds a charge.

From my testing, I think it’s clear that if you want the best photo quality available in an Instax printer, then the $169.95 Mini Link+ is the one to get. It also makes the case for being a worthy upgrade for some Mini Link 3 owners, so long as you’re not expecting improved prints of text-heavy illustrations.

But its price puts the Mini Link+ into direct competition with dye-sublimation printers like the Canon Selphy QX20 which yields prints that are sharp and accurate with better resistance to water and fading. Otherwise, the Mini Link 3 is still a great printer for the price, and the soft, moody images it prints is a vibe worth $100.

﻿Congress now has two weeks to negotiate new funding limits for ICE before DHS is shut down again.

The Senate voted on Friday evening to pass the federal budget, funding everything except for one entity: the Department of Homeland Security, which was given a two-week funding extension in order to negotiate new guardrails around Immigrations and Customs Enforcement (ICE). If no agreement is reached, DHS funding will lapse and the department will face a shutdown.

The agreement — the result of frenzied negotiations between a united Senate Democrat caucus, their Republican counterparts, and the White House — passed 71-29. DHS will remain unfunded over the weekend, however, until the House of Representatives reconvenes on Monday to approve the new stopgap bill.

It’s a stunning reversal of course for the DHS funding bill, which was expected to pass the Senate with a handful of moderate Dem votes, despite vocal opposition for its continued funding of ICE. But after federal agents killed Alex Pretti during a protest in Minneapolis, the Senate Democrats unanimously announced that they would not vote to continue funding the DHS without significant reforms to ICE, forcing the Trump administration into negotiations over keeping the government open. (It would have been the second government shutdown in less than a year.)

Though the Democratic caucus often fractures, the political headwinds were in their favor. A poll conducted by the Democrat-aligned Senate Majority PAC found that a solid majority of voters were in favor of the Democrats forcing a partial shutdown over ICE reforms, and would place the blame on the Republicans if the government remained closed.

Because he was a registered sex offender.

Would it surprise you to learn Microsoft booted Jeffrey Epstein from its online gaming platform? As spotted by XboxEra, the latest batch of Epstein’s emails shows that in December 2013, he was “permanently suspended due to harassment, threats, and/or abuse of other players.”

But it appears the real reason may be simpler: A second email from Microsoft to Epstein the very same day shows he was banned because he was a registered sex offender, and because Microsoft was among the companies that agreed to purge registered sex offenders from their systems.

While Epstein became a registered sex offender years earlier, another email shows he may not have joined Xbox Live until October 2012. Microsoft joined New York state’s initiative to purge sex offenders from online platforms where they might bump into children back in April 2012, so it seems it didn’t ban his account for over a year.

It’s not clear if Epstein played Xbox himself, though. In July 2014, he asks his executive assistant “do we have an xbox 360 kinect?” and in 2016 this email appears to be a discussion of buying an Xbox as a surprise birthday gift for a boy. In 2019, a message reads, “Why is there a $25.24 charge on Xbox?”

﻿The latest round of layoffs at the fitness brand ‘mostly’ affected members of its engineering team, according to Bloomberg.

Peloton said on Friday that it’s cutting around 11 percent of its staff, mostly impacting “engineers working on technology and enterprise-related efforts,” reports Bloomberg.

Last August, Peloton laid off six percent of its workforce and told investors it would continue layoffs globally in 2026, in an attempt to cut at least $100 million of annual spending by the end of the fiscal year.

Peloton’s latest strategy shift to reverse the effect of its pandemic-era boom stalling out has also brought new hardware with Peloton IQ AI features. The Cross Training Series that debuted last October includes a new Bike, Bike Plus, Tread, Tread Plus, and Row Plus that add real-time form feedback, workout analysis, and AI-generated workout routines, as it increases its subscription prices. Sales have been on a persistent downward spiral, and Bloomberg noted an earlier report that initial sales of the AI-equipped gear have been sluggish.

The Verge contacted Peloton but did not receive an on-the-record response.

﻿Google’s Project Genie generates interactive virtual worlds from prompts that look almost like games, if you squint a little.

The stock prices of some major video game companies, including Take-Two Interactive, Roblox, and Unity, had notable declines on Friday, just a day after Google announced its Project Genie tool that lets users prompt AI to generate interactive experiences, Reuters reports. Take-Two’s stock price closed at $220.30 (down 7.93 percent from yesterday), Roblox’s closed at $65.76 (down 13.17 percent), and Unity’s closed at $29.10 (down 24.22 percent).

Other AI tools have received significant pushback from artists and creators over allegations of theft of their work to train the underlying AI models, AI’s water and electricity usage, and what this means for creative output. Google DeepMind’s Diego Rivas told The Verge that Genie 3, the AI world model powering Project Genie, was “trained primarily on publicly available data from the web,” and a white paper from Google DeepMind researchers about the first Genie model said that it was trained from “a large dataset of over 200,000 hours of publicly available Internet gaming videos.”

Many game developers are already very skeptical of generative AI and its hand in seemingly ripping off existing works to let people create AI slop. The Super Mario and The Legend of Zelda-like worlds I was able to create from prompts with Project Genie somewhat resembled Nintendo’s actual games, but the experiences didn’t have any of the fun or playability of the originals. For an industry already grappling with wave after wave after wave of layoffs, even the current form of Project Genie represents a pitch to replace work like testing and concept building.

The version of Project Genie Google presented this week can only make interactive experiences that are 60 seconds long. They have no scores, objectives, or even sound. They can have strange errors and inconsistencies, like a racetrack road unexpectedly turning into grass. When you’re done with an experience, you can only download a video of it or generate a new one; you can’t take what you’ve made in Project Genie and slot it into a traditional game development tool like Unreal Engine or Unity.

But the push by investors and executives for AI game creation tools is already being spelled out. xAI CEO Elon Musk has promised “Real-time, high-quality shows and video games at scale, customized to the individual, next year.” Epic Games CEO Tim Sweeney said Friday that “We’ll see constant leapfrogging between engine centric AI and world model centric AI until they come together for maximum effect.” Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg went long on the company’s earnings call this week about how AI will help games feel “more immersive and interactive,” making his comments just a couple of weeks after shutting down VR game studios and projects.

Sonos isn’t exactly synonymous with the Super Bowl, although the brand discounts its gear every year around this time like clockwork. It’s knocking 20 percent off many of its marquee products, including soundbars and standalone speakers — all of which can be paired together to improve sound quality and to put audio in more places at home.

Through February 16th, the company is keeping its prices in place on the Era 100 and the larger Era 300 speakers, the Beam and Arc Ultra soundbars, as well as its selection of wireless subwoofers. To put the prices in context, some of these discounts match — or beat — the current costs of Sonos’ certified refurbished gear.

The Era 100 very well may be the best, most feature-packed smart speaker around in its price range. In our 2023 review, we praised its stereo sound playback and improved bass response over its predecessor, the Sonos One. Notably, it supports Bluetooth playback (in addition to Wi-Fi connectivity) as well as line-in audio via USB-C, in case you’d rather plug in a wired audio source. While this model typically sells for $219, it’s currently available for $179 through Sonos, as well as Amazon and Best Buy.

The Era 300 is Sonos’ modern spin on the Sonos Five, offering bigger sound than the Era 100. Its specialty is spatial audio, which sounds incredible when you find a song that’s been mixed just right (the thing is, not all Dolby Atmos tunes are mixed equally). Like the Era 100, this model offers Bluetooth and Wi-Fi wireless connections, as well as line-in via USB-C. Our review notes, however, that stereo playback is an area where the Era 300 actually falters compared to its predecessor. But given its improvements overall (and since the Five that launched in 2020 is no longer on sale), the 300 is a great speaker to consider if you really want to feel immersed in your music. It’s $379 during the sale period at Sonos, Amazon, and Best Buy, down from $479.

Jumping to soundbars, the second-gen Beam is on sale for $369 at Amazon, Best Buy, and Sonos, down from its original price of $499. While it’s definitely not the most feature-packed soundbar that you can get at around this price, its ability to tie-in with other Sonos products, plus its improved soundstage over the first-gen model might make it worth considering for you. The inclusion of Dolby Atmos is its marquee feature, although we noted in our review that it’s a virtualized effect since it lacks upward firing speakers that truly enable the vertical sound effects to shine. Note that it’s lacking in physical connectivity compared to most other models, with just a power plug, an HDMI eARC port, and an ethernet jack. In the event that you wish to connect the Beam to your TV or receiver via optical audio, you’ll need to purchase this $25 HDMI-to-optical adapter.

The Arc Ultra is a much better soundbar than the Beam, though it also carries a larger price tag of $899 (down from $1,099) at Amazon, Best Buy, and Sonos. Our reviewer noted that the bass improvements in this model are such that it can stand on its own without the purchase of a wireless subwoofer. It also boasts more immersive sound quality, plus Bluetooth connectivity, which was missing in the original Arc. The Arc Ultra’s sound can be further enhanced by connecting other Sonos speakers to the mix, although its older Play:1 and Play:3 speakers are ineligible to join the speaker family for surround sound.

If you’re considering either the Bean or the Arc Ultra (or if you already own one of its soundbars), their performance will benefit greatly with the addition of a Sonos subwoofer, of which the company makes two models. The Sub 4 is its high-end option, which is $759 during the sale period (down from $899) at Amazon, Best Buy, and Sonos’ online store. Anything this close to $1,000 is extremely expensive for a subwoofer, especially considering that most companies include one with their surround sound systems. The Sub 4 is able to lay horizontally or sit vertically — however suits your room best.

For almost half the cost of the Sub 4, you can get the Sub Mini. It’s available for $399, down from $499, from Amazon, Best Buy, and Sonos. You may be thinking that even this one is still pretty costly, and I agree. Although, it’s a product that Sonos loyalists were begging for, as before it there was no other choice than to spring for its more expensive subwoofer. In our review, we deemed it unworthy for filling large rooms with bass, but totally sufficient in most other ways. Something cool about its design is the force-canceling effect that reduces floor vibrations, which could be great if you’re worried about disturbing neighbors or other people in the house.

            <h2>Inside the marketplace powering bespoke AI deepfakes of real women</h2>
            <p><strong>MIT Technology Review | 2026-01-30</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2026/01/30/1131945/inside-the-marketplace-powering-bespoke-ai-deepfakes-of-real-women/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Civitai—an online marketplace for buying and selling AI-generated content, backed by the venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz—is letting users buy custom instruction files for generating celebrity deepfakes. Some of these files were specifically designed to make pornographic images banned by the site, a new analysis has found.

The study, from researchers at Stanford and Indiana University, looked at people’s requests for content on the site, called “bounties.” The researchers found that between mid-2023 and the end of 2024, most bounties asked for animated content—but a significant portion were for deepfakes of real people, and 90% of these deepfake requests targeted women. (Their findings have not yet been peer reviewed.)

The debate around deepfakes, as illustrated by the recent backlash to explicit images on the X-owned chatbot Grok, has revolved around what platforms should do to block such content. Civitai’s situation is a little more complicated. Its marketplace includes actual images, videos, and models, but it also lets individuals buy and sell instruction files called LoRAs that can coach mainstream AI models like Stable Diffusion into generating content they were not trained to produce. Users can then combine these files with other tools to make deepfakes that are graphic or sexual. The researchers found that 86% of deepfake requests on Civitai were for LoRAs.

In these bounties, users requested “high quality” models to generate images of public figures like the influencer Charli D’Amelio or the singer Gracie Abrams, often linking to their social media profiles so their images could be grabbed from the web. Some requests specified a desire for models that generated the individual’s entire body, accurately captured their tattoos, or allowed hair color to be changed. Some requests targeted several women in specific niches, like artists who record ASMR videos. One request was for a deepfake of a woman said to be the user’s wife. Anyone on the site could offer up AI models they worked on for the task, and the best submissions received payment—anywhere from $0.50 to $5. And nearly 92% of the deepfake bounties were awarded.

Neither Civitai nor Andreessen Horowitz responded to requests for comment.

It’s possible that people buy these LoRAs to make deepfakes that aren’t sexually explicit (though they’d still violate Civitai’s terms of use, and they’d still be ethically fraught). But Civitai also offers educational resources on how to use external tools to further customize the outputs of image generators—for example, by changing someone’s pose. The site also hosts user-written articles with details on how to instruct models to generate pornography. The researchers found that the amount of porn on the platform has gone up, and that the majority of requests each week are now for NSFW content.

“Not only does Civitai provide the infrastructure that facilitates these issues; they also explicitly teach their users how to utilize them,” says Matthew DeVerna, a postdoctoral researcher at Stanford’s Cyber Policy Center and one of the study’s leaders.

The company used to ban only sexually explicit deepfakes of real people, but in May 2025 it announced it would ban all deepfake content. Nonetheless, countless requests for deepfakes submitted before this ban now remain live on the site, and many of the winning submissions fulfilling those requests remain available for purchase, MIT Technology Review confirmed.

“I believe the approach that they’re trying to take is to sort of do as little as possible, such that they can foster as much—I guess they would call it—creativity on the platform,” DeVerna says.

Users buy LoRAs with the site’s online currency, called Buzz, which is purchased with real money. In May 2025, Civita’s credit card processor cut off the company because of its ongoing problem with nonconsensual content. To pay for explicit content, users must now use gift cards or cryptocurrency to buy Buzz; the company offers a different scrip for non-explicit content.

Civitai automatically tags bounties requesting deepfakes and lists a way for the person featured in the content to manually request its takedown. This system means that Civitai has a reasonably successful way of knowing which bounties are for deepfakes, but it’s still leaving moderation to the general public rather than carrying it out proactively.

A company’s legal liability for what its users do isn’t totally clear. Generally, tech companies have broad legal protections against such liability for their content under Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, but those protections aren’t limitless. For example, “you cannot knowingly facilitate illegal transactions on your website,” says Ryan Calo, a professor specializing in technology and AI at the University of Washington’s law school. (Calo wasn’t involved in this new study.)

Civitai joined OpenAI, Anthropic, and other AI companies in 2024 in adopting design principles to guard against the creation and spread of AI-generated child sexual abuse material . This move followed a 2023 report from the Stanford Internet Observatory, which found that the vast majority of AI models named in child sexual abuse communities were Stable Diffusion–based models “predominantly obtained via Civitai.”

But adult deepfakes have not gotten the same level of attention from content platforms or the venture capital firms that fund them. “They are not afraid enough of it. They are overly tolerant of it,” Calo says. “Neither law enforcement nor civil courts adequately protect against it. It is night and day.”

Civitai received a $5 million investment from Andreessen Horowitz (a16z) in November 2023. In a video shared by a16z, Civitai cofounder and CEO Justin Maier described his goal of building the main place where people find and share AI models for their own individual purposes. “We’ve aimed to make this space that’s been very, I guess, niche and engineering-heavy more and more approachable to more and more people,” he said.

Civitai is not the only company with a deepfake problem in a16z’s investment portfolio; in February, MIT Technology Review first reported that another company, Botify AI, was hosting AI companions resembling real actors that stated their age as under 18, engaged in sexually charged conversations, offered “hot photos,” and in some instances described age-of-consent laws as “arbitrary” and “meant to be broken.”

How the sometimes-weird world of lifespan extension is gaining influence

—Jessica HamzelouFor the last couple of years, I’ve been following the progress of a group of individuals who believe death is humanity’s “core problem.” Put simply, they say death is wrong—for everyone. They’ve even said it’s morally wrong.

They established what they consider a new philosophy, and they called it Vitalism.Vitalism is more than a philosophy, though—it’s a movement for hardcore longevity enthusiasts who want to make real progress in finding treatments that slow or reverse aging. Not just through scientific advances, but by persuading influential people to support their movement, and by changing laws and policies to open up access to experimental drugs. And they’re starting to make progress.

Therapists are secretly using ChatGPT. Clients are triggered.Declan would never have found out his therapist was using ChatGPT had it not been for a technical mishap. The connection was patchy during one of their online sessions, so Declan suggested they turn off their video feeds. Instead, his therapist began inadvertently sharing his screen.For the rest of the session, Declan was privy to a real-time stream of ChatGPT analysis rippling across his therapist’s screen, who was taking what Declan was saying, putting it into ChatGPT, and then parroting its answers.But Declan is not alone. In fact, a growing number of people are reporting receiving AI-generated communiqués from their therapists. Clients’ trust and privacy are being abandoned in the process. Read the full story.

            <div id="article-text">For the last couple of years, I’ve been following the progress of a group of individuals who believe death is humanity’s “core problem.” Put simply, they say death is wrong—for everyone. They’ve even said it’s morally wrong.

They established what they consider a new philosophy, and they called it Vitalism.

Vitalism is more than a philosophy, though—it’s a movement for hardcore longevity enthusiasts who want to make real progress in finding treatments that slow or reverse aging. Not just through scientific advances, but by persuading influential people to support their movement, and by changing laws and policies to open up access to experimental drugs.

Vitalism was founded by Adam Gries and Nathan Cheng—two men who united over their shared desire to find ways to extend human lifespan. I first saw Cheng speak back in 2023, at Zuzalu, a pop-up city in Montenegro for people who were interested in life extension and some other technologies. (It was an interesting experience—you can read more about it here.)

Zuzalu was where Gries and Cheng officially launched Vitalism. But I’ve been closely following the longevity scene since 2022. That journey took me to Switzerland, Honduras, and a compound in Berkeley, California, where like-minded longevity enthusiasts shared their dreams of life extension.

It also took me to Washington, DC, where, last year, supporters of lifespan extension presented politicians including Mehmet Oz, who currently leads the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, with their case for changes to laws and policies.

The journey has been fascinating, and at times weird and even surreal. I’ve heard biohacking stories that ended with smoking legs. I’ve been told about a multi-partner relationship that might be made possible through the cryopreservation—and subsequent reanimation—of a man and the multiple wives he’s had throughout his life. I’ve had people tell me to my face that they consider themselves eugenicists, and that they believe that parents should select IVF embryos for their propensity for a long life.

I’ve seen people draw blood during dinner in an upscale hotel restaurant to test their biological age. I’ve heard wild plans to preserve human consciousness and resurrect it in machines. Others have told me their plans to inject men’s penises with multiple doses of an experimental gene therapy in order to treat erectile dysfunction and ultimately achieve “radical longevity.”

I’ve been shouted at and threatened with legal action. I’ve received barefoot hugs. One interviewee told me I needed Botox. It’s been a ride.

My reporting has also made me realize that the current interest in longevity reaches beyond social media influencers and wellness centers. Longevity clinics are growing in number, and there’s been a glut of documentaries about living longer or even forever.

At the same time, powerful people who influence state laws, giant federal funding budgets, and even national health policy are prioritizing the search for treatments that slow or reverse aging. The longevity community was thrilled when longtime supporter Jim O’Neill was made deputy secretary of health and human services last year. Other members of Trump’s administration, including Oz, have spoken about longevity too. “It seems that now there is the most pro-longevity administration in American history,” Gries told me.

I recently spoke to Alicia Jackson, the new director of ARPA-H. The agency, established in 2022 under Joe Biden’s presidency, funds “breakthrough” biomedical research. And it appears to have a new focus on longevity. Jackson previously founded and led Evernow, a company focused on “health and longevity for every woman.”

“There’s a lot of interesting technologies, but they all kind of come back to the same thing: Could we extend life years?” she told me over a Zoom call a few weeks ago. She added that her agency had “incredible support” from “the very top of HHS.” I asked if she was referring to Jim O’Neill. “Yeah,” she said. She wouldn’t go into the specifics.

Gries is right: There is a lot of support for advances in longevity treatments, and some of it is coming from influential people in positions of power. Perhaps the field really is poised for a breakthrough.

And that’s what makes this field so fascinating to cover. Despite the occasional weirdness.

            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2026/01/29/1131938/dhs-is-using-google-and-adobe-ai-to-make-videos/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The US Department of Homeland Security is using AI video generators from Google and Adobe to make and edit content shared with the public, a new document reveals. It comes as immigration agencies have flooded social media with content to support President Trump&#39;s mass deportation agenda—some of which appears to be made with AI—and as workers in tech have put pressure on their employers to denounce the agencies’ activities.

The document, released on Wednesday, provides an inventory of which commercial AI tools DHS uses for tasks ranging from generating drafts of documents to managing cybersecurity.

In a section about “editing images, videos or other public affairs materials using AI,” it reveals for the first time that DHS is using Google&#39;s Veo 3 video generator and Adobe Firefly, estimating that the agency has between 100 and 1,000 licenses for the tools. It also discloses that DHS uses Microsoft Copilot Chat for generating first drafts of documents and summarizing long reports and Poolside software for coding tasks, in addition to tools from other companies.

Google, Adobe, and DHS did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

The news provides details about how agencies like Immigrations and Customs Enforcement, which is part of DHS, might be creating the large amounts of content they’ve shared on X and other channels as immigration operations have expanded across US cities. They’ve posted content celebrating “Christmas after mass deportations,” referenced Bible verses and Christ’s birth, showed faces of those the agency has arrested, and shared ads aimed at recruiting agents. The agencies have also repeatedly used music without permissions from artists in their videos.

Some of the content, particularly videos, has the appearance of being AI-generated, but it hasn’t been clear until now what AI models the agencies might be using. This marks the first concrete evidence such generators are being used by DHS to create content shared with the public.

It still remains impossible to verify which company helped create a specific piece of content, or indeed if it was AI-generated at all. Adobe offers options to “watermark” a video made with its tools to disclose that it is AI-generated, for example, but this disclosure does not always stay intact when the content is uploaded and shared across different sites.

The document reveals that DHS has specifically been using Flow, a tool from Google that combines its Veo 3 video generator with a suite of filmmaking tools. Users can generate clips and assemble entire videos with AI, including videos that contain sound, dialogue, and background noise, making them hyperrealistic. Adobe launched its Firefly generator in 2023, promising that it does not use copyrighted content in its training or output. Like Google’s tools, Adobe’s can generate videos, images, soundtracks, and speech. The document does not reveal further details about how the agency is using these video generation tools.

Workers at large tech companies, including more than 140 current and former employees from Google and more than 30 from Adobe, have been putting pressure on their employers in recent weeks to take a stance against ICE and the shooting of Alex Pretti on January 24. Google’s leadership has not made statements in response. In October, Google and Apple removed apps on their app stores that were intended to track sightings of ICE, citing safety risks.

An additional document released on Wednesday revealed new details about how the agency is using more niche AI products, including a facial recognition app used by ICE, as first reported by 404Media in June.

Meet the Vitalists: the hardcore longevity enthusiasts who believe death is “wrong”

Last April, an excited crowd gathered at a compound in Berkeley, California, for a three-day event called the Vitalist Bay Summit. It was part of a longer, two-month residency that hosted various events to explore tools—from drug regulation to cryonics—that might be deployed in the fight against death.One of the main goals, though, was to spread the word of Vitalism, a somewhat radical movement established by Nathan Cheng and his colleague Adam Gries a few years ago. Consider it longevity for the most hardcore adherents—a sweeping mission to which nothing short of total devotion will do.Although interest in longevity has certainly taken off in recent years, not everyone in the broader longevity space shares Vitalists’ commitment to actually making death obsolete. And the Vitalists feel that momentum is building, not just for the science of aging and the development of lifespan-extending therapies, but for the acceptance of their philosophy that defeating death should be humanity’s top concern.

What AI “remembers” about you is privacy’s next frontier

The ability to remember you and your preferences is rapidly becoming a big selling point for AI chatbots and agents.Personalized, interactive AI systems are built to act on our behalf, maintain context across conversations, and improve our ability to carry out all sorts of tasks, from booking travel to filing taxes.But their ability to store and retrieve increasingly intimate details about their users over time introduces alarming, and all-too-familiar, privacy vulnerabilities––many of which have loomed since “big data” first teased the power of spotting and acting on user patterns. Worse, AI agents now appear poised to plow through whatever safeguards had been adopted to avoid those vulnerabilities. So what can developers do to fix this problem? Read the full story.

The eastern half of the US saw a monster snowstorm over the weekend. The good news is the grid has largely been able to keep up with the freezing temperatures and increased demand. But there were some signs of strain, particularly for fossil-fuel plants.One analysis found that PJM, the nation’s largest grid operator, saw significant unplanned outages in plants that run on natural gas and coal. Historically, these facilities can struggle in extreme winter weather.Much of the country continues to face record-low temperatures, and the possibility is looming for even more snow this weekend. What lessons can we take from this storm, and how might we shore up the grid to cope with extreme weather? Read the full story.

            <div id="article-text">Apple confirmed this week that it has acquired Israeli AI startup Q.ai in a deal valued at close to $2 billion, making it one of the company’s largest acquisitions ever, second only to the $3 billion purchase of Beats in 2014.

But check your assumptions: this isn’t Beats 2.0. There’s no new headphone brand to flex. Instead, Apple is paying top dollar for tech that might let your devices understand you without you ever saying a word.

​​These days we put our phones on silent so they won’t disturb us; soon the phone will put us on silent so it can understand us.

Q.ai has been operating in secrecy since its founding in 2022. Its machine-learning research focuses on interpreting “silent speech”, detecting imperceptible facial micro-movements, and subtle audio cues to infer what someone means to say.

Patents suggest this tech could work in headphones, smart glasses, or other wearables so users can issue commands privately, even in a quiet library.

That future has a decidedly dramatic edge: imagine telling Siri to skip a track or read your messages without ever parting your lips. Apple executives call the acquisition a way to fuse machine learning with next-generation hardware.

Longtime Apple watcher Johny Srouji praised Q.ai as “a remarkable company that is pioneering new and creative ways to use imaging and machine learning.”

At first blush, spending almost $2 billion on not speaking might sound like corporate futurism taken to a comic extreme. We already have voice assistants that sometimes struggle to understand us when we do speak.

Yet here’s Apple’s bet: once devices can interpret faint facial cues, the entire paradigm of human-computer interaction shifts, from keyboards and taps to gestures and barely-audible intentions.

This move also signals how Apple’s AI strategy is evolving. Some critical voices have noted that the company has lagged behind competitors in generative AI and conversational assistants, even partnering with Google to bring Gemini-powered features into its ecosystem. Acquiring Q.ai suggests Cupertino isn’t just chasing language models; it wants to redefine the interface itself.

There’s a strange poetry to this. In an era when every tech giant is clamouring to make their AI chatty, Apple is buying a company that may prime its devices to be less vocal, more intuitive, and perhaps eerily discreet.

It’s the sort of paradox that defines modern tech: a quieter future might demand the loudest investment.

If this sounds like science fiction, well, it does. But Q.ai’s technology, as described in recent reports, could translate into features in AirPods, Vision Pro headsets, or future wearables as soon as 2027. Could it help Siri finally feel less like a confused concierge and more like an unseen assistant tuned to your intent? That remains to be seen.

Either way, Apple’s big wager on silent speech reminds us that innovation doesn’t always roar. Sometimes, it listens for the quietest signals and pays dearly for them.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">G2, the Chicago-based software insights platform, agreed today to acquire three prominent software review and discovery properties from Gartner: Capterra, Software Advice, and GetApp.

The deal brings four of the largest B2B review sites under a single roof and signals a shift toward unified, AI-driven software recommendation and buying experiences.

According to the announcement, the combined business will include roughly six million verified customer reviews and tap into an audience of more than 200 million annual software buyers. G2 said it expects the transaction to close in the first quarter of 2026, subject to standard regulatory and closing conditions.

G2’s leadership frames the agreement as a response to fragmentation in the software buying journey. By consolidating multiple review databases and audiences, the company aims to streamline discovery for buyers and expand demand-generation tools for vendors.

In a public post, G2’s CEO described the integration as building “the trusted data foundation for B2B software in the age of AI,” with deeper buyer intent signals and a more consistent taxonomy across categories.

For buyers, the enlarged platform promises easier access to user-verified feedback and faster decision cycles. For software vendors, the unified dataset could translate into broader visibility and enhanced market insights.

G2’s roadmap includes tighter AI integration across search and recommendation workflows.

Gartner, which currently owns Capterra, Software Advice, and GetApp, has held these properties for years as part of its digital markets portfolio.

This divestiture appears to reflect a strategic choice to focus its core research and advisory business while enabling specialized review platforms to evolve under a dedicated marketplace operator.

As the software market continues to expand, the consolidation of review infrastructure under G2 could reshape how products are evaluated and purchased.

The market will watch closely for how the combined entity leverages its scale to influence search visibility and buyer influence metrics in 2026 and beyond.

            <div id="article-text">AI adoption is creating a clear divide among employees. Some see AI as a tool to increase their impact, while others see it as a threat to their role. So, where does the truth lie between these two mindsets? Let’s explore.

Over the past two years, we’ve seen a wave of layoffs often attributed to “AI replacing humans.” Among widely discussed cases, IBM openly stated that over 7,000 back-office roles may no longer need to be hired because AI can absorb the work. Many other tech players, including Microsoft, Amazon, and HP, have cut between 6,000 and 200,000 employees as a shift toward AI-driven initiatives.

Meanwhile, beware: many might make misleading conclusions. They are often treated as straightforward examples of AI replacing human labor, when in reality they reflect a deeper restructuring of how value is created inside organizations.

Taking a closer look, it becomes evident that in many examples like these, people weren’t displaced because AI was smarter or outperformed people.

They were displaced because one (or more) of the following reasons:

TNW City Coworking space - Where your best work happens

A workspace designed for growth, collaboration, and endless networking opportunities in the heart of tech.

From this perspective, it becomes evident: AI isn’t coming for roles, it’s here to remove low-leverage work. Roles that exist mainly to handle volume or work around broken systems no longer make sense once those problems disappear.

This is already playing out across teams. For example:

As AI reduces friction and automates workflows, organizations and employees are increasingly forced to ask these two questions: 1) where real value is created, 2) where human input is essential in areas AI cannot handle. Teams that explore and embrace this shift early will be better positioned to adapt as AI continues to compress the cost and effort of execution.

An overlooked but highly efficient aspect many businesses miss: AI introduces a level of transparency most organizations have never had before. This visibility changes how organizations make decisions and how they manage business resources.
In particular, AI-powered spend analysis is set to become one of the most transformative forces inside companies.

Ultimately, the level of business success is largely determined by the ability to turn spend data into an operational signal. When, instead of tracking costs in isolation, organizations clearly see how spend translates into productivity and revenue, that’s where real differentiation begins.

Smart spend management platforms like this already exist, take Spendbase, for example. In this case, AI can be the next layer that unlocks even deeper insights.

ROI and cost efficiency are at the very center of any business. Therefore, as AI increases transparency into multiple business areas (performance, time, spend, etc.), work that cannot be clearly tied to outcomes loses its footing. Hence, roles that fail to translate their work into clear outcomes risk being deprioritized.

As AI automates execution, the people and teams that remain essential are those who can clearly explain how their work impacts the business in ways AI cannot. Such as:

Apart from this, another important area of impact lies in organizational and customer-facing work, where human-driven value is created from responsibilities focused on aligning teams, resolving complexity, building trust, and, particularly, innovating.

Imagine a product team competing in a crowded market or where competitors are continuously copying each other. In this case, AI can meticulously handle research and benchmarking: analyze competitor offerings, user behavior, reviews, and market gaps.

It can even generate predictions or simulate feature adoption. However, it takes human vision and accountability to challenge assumptions and find unpaved paths for growth.

When it comes to creating something inherently new, with no existing market equivalent, AI may fall short at innovation. Yet these are often the areas where the greatest business impact lies.

In most organizations, changes revolving AI adoption won’t happen overnight. Roles will gradually shrink, shift, and eventually be redefined. As a result, human contributions that can’t be tied to measurable outcomes quietly lose relevance.

            <div id="article-text">The way people discover information online is quietly but fundamentally changing.

Instead of scrolling through links and choosing which article to open, users are increasingly asking large language models to answer directly. Tools like ChatGPT and Perplexity don’t send people browsing; they synthesise information from multiple sources and deliver a ready-made response inside the interface.

For brands and publishers, this creates a new problem: what does visibility mean when nobody clicks anymore?

For years, search optimization revolved around a familiar feedback loop: publish content, earn rankings, drive clicks, measure performance. Traffic, impressions, and engagement acted as proxies for relevance and influence. AI-generated answers disrupt that loop entirely.

This isn’t a temporary fluctuation in search behaviour. It’s a structural shift in how information is consumed.

Large language models do not simply index the web like classic search engines. Their response generation involves a combination of training data, real-time search, and internal reasoning. As shown in analyses comparing Perplexity and ChatGPT, these systems search the web differently even when responding to the same questions.

ChatGPT tends to issue longer, context-rich queries to build an explanation, whereas Perplexity formulates shorter, list-like queries focused on freshness and comparison.

This means visibility isn’t universal across models; a topic that surfaces in one LLM is not guaranteed to surface in another.

If clicks are no longer the primary signal, content strategies must adapt. Instead of optimizing only for human users and search engine algorithms:

Content intended for modern AI discovery needs both depth and freshness: explanations that support contextual reasoning (favoured by ChatGPT-style behaviour) and concise, signal-rich sections (favoured by Perplexity-style behaviour). This duality underscores the complexity of AI brand visibility.

Publishers and marketers have few tools to assess whether their pages are actually being consulted by AI agents. Traditional analytics platforms report pageviews, but:

This lack of transparency means that even high-quality content may go unnoticed in AI answers, not because it is irrelevant, but because it does not match the specific patterns an LLM uses when selecting sources.

Recognising the need for a new feedback loop, solutions are emerging that approach this problem from an engineering perspective rather than purely a marketing one. For instance, Genezio has analysed how ChatGPT and Perplexity prioritise sources and generate their search behaviours, revealing that the same topic leads to substantially different retrieval patterns across systems and therefore different visibility outcomes.

Rather than treating AI visibility as a black box, these approaches:

By observing how AI systems behave at scale, marketers can begin to measure brand visibility in conversations rather than clicks, transforming raw engineering data into actionable insight.

AI-generated answers are rapidly reshaping how information is found, processed, and presented. In this new environment, visibility is not just about ranking formulas or organic traffic; it’s about earning a place in the narrative that LLMs generate.

The brands that succeed will be those that understand not only how to produce quality content, but also how to make it legible and extractable to systems that never lead users back to a webpage.

Measuring visibility without clicks may seem intangible today, but as AI becomes central to how people seek answers, it will soon become standard practice.

            <h2>Bonjour Visio: France turns digital sovereignty into policy</h2>
            <p><strong>The Next Web | 2026-01-28</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://thenextweb.com/news/france-turns-digital-sovereignty-into-policy">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">In a bold turn of phrase and deed, Paris has quietly told Silicon Valley “au revoir.”  On January 26, 2026, France’s Ministry of Finance announced that by 2027, all public servants will switch from U.S. video apps like Microsoft Teams and Zoom to a homegrown platform called Visio.

No more license renewals for Teams, Zoom, Webex, or Meet, just one unified, French-built solution.

In one stroke, a long-discussed slogan “digital sovereignty” has leapt off the podium and into practice. This is not a press release; it’s a watershed moment: Europe’s second-biggest economy is wagering that, when it comes to critical infrastructure, it’s time to govern itself.

“Digital sovereignty” has become the EU’s new watchword, a declaration of independence from foreign tech hegemons. Over the past few years, it has surged from a niche policy to a headline priority, as EU leaders from Ursula von der Leyen to Emmanuel Macron have warned that Europe must control its own networks and data.

The latest rumblings from the EU tech scene, a story from our wise ol&#39; founder Boris, and some questionable AI art. It&#39;s free, every week, in your inbox. Sign up now!

The phrase sounds grand, but what changed now is urgency. Americans’ own laws make the risks concrete: under the U.S. CLOUD Act, for example, U.S. authorities can demand data from any American platform, regardless of where it’s stored.

In practice, “jurisdiction follows ownership,” as one analyst noted: even data sitting on a Frankfurt server can be swept up by U.S. warrants if the service provider is American.

Edward Snowden’s revelations and murky court orders have long haunted Europe with the idea that a virtual meeting might be spied on from overseas. Now, with geopolitics in flux, U.S. political turns and global crises, that theoretical risk seems all too real.

The push has taken many forms. The EU has drafted cloud-certification rules demanding “sovereignty” guarantees and drafted data laws to keep Europeans’ information in Europe.

Member states debate mandating local clouds. Digital sovereignty has moved from virtue-signaling to something harder, actual infrastructure.

France’s pivot is concrete and wide-ranging. Visio, developed by the government’s interministerial digital agency (DINUM), has been tested for about a year with some 40,000 regular users. It’s already being adopted piecemeal: CNRS (France’s national research center) will replace all its 34,000 Zoom seats by March 2026, covering 120,000 associated researchers.

By early 2026, the Defense Ministry, finance tax offices, health insurance, and other big agencies will be on Visio. The government now says every state department will use Visio as the default video tool by 2027, after which external conferencing licenses simply won’t be renewed.

The official rationale is familiar: a patchwork of Teams, Zoom, Webex, and friends “fragilises security” and creates hidden costs, dependencies, and interoperability headaches.

Visio is billed as a solution under full French control: it’s hosted on a certified “SecNumCloud” by Dassault-owned Outscale, built with ANSSI (France’s cyber agency) oversight, and even uses French AI for meeting transcription and captions.

The aim, in the minister’s words, is to “end the use of non-European solutions and guarantee the security and confidentiality of public electronic communications by relying on a powerful…sovereign tool”.

In short: no more data flying through American servers or falling under foreign laws.

There are financial perks, too. Officials point out that ditching pricey Teams and Zoom licenses will save money: roughly €1 million per year for every 100,000 users who shift off commercial tools. That’s not pocket change, even if it’s a rounding error in a €600 billion budget. In any case, for France, this isn’t just about cost – it’s about control.

Taken together, these facts show a very concrete policy timeline. In one meeting on Jan. 26, the state literally put a deadline on dependence: four years to shift the ENTIRE civil service. It’s one thing to talk about sovereignty in Brussels speeches, quite another to swap out the nation’s video chat app.

France isn’t alone in flirting with this idea, but it’s the first to bet big. Other EU countries are eyeballing similar moves. In Denmark, parts of the public sector have already announced plans to phase out Microsoft’s software.

In Germany, the state of Schleswig-Holstein recently ditched Microsoft Office in favor of open-source alternatives. Even non-state bodies are joining the sovereignty club: the International Criminal Court said it will move its systems to a German-developed open-source platform (OpenDesk).

These are baby steps compared to France’s all-hands policy, but they reflect a shared unease about over-reliance on foreign tech.

Europe is also wrestling with headline-grabbing hiccups like last year’s massive cloud outages in the U.S., which left public agencies scrambling. The Visio announcement itself notes that Europe’s “overreliance on U.S. IT infrastructure” has been questioned after those failures.

And there are EU-wide initiatives underway, from the Gaia-X cloud alliance to tougher data localization rules – aimed at seeding local alternatives.

If France makes Visio work, it could serve as a proof of concept for others. Will a homegrown tool really run government communications smoothly? If yes, it might embolden policymakers in Brussels or Rome to push harder on local platforms. If not, it could slow the momentum.

For now, France’s move is a beacon: it shows that digital sovereignty can move beyond talk. Other nations will watch closely.

No one seriously argues that keeping calls on Visio will magically end world unrest. Rather, this is a narrow, technical solution to a policy problem. On the other side, France will indeed have tighter control: all servers, encryption keys, and software updates are now under French (and EU) jurisdiction.

Public-sector IT teams can audit code, set security parameters, and avoid nasty surprises (say, a foreign court order) without jumping through transatlantic hoops.

Data stays where the politicians say it stays.

But what might be lost? For one, user experience and innovation often depend on scale. Big Tech’s video platforms have oceans of R&D behind them, from instant translation to seamless device-hopping, and millions of users giving feedback.

A new platform built from scratch may not match Teams’ polish or Zoom’s ubiquity overnight. (The French have even admitted an irony: naming it “Visio” risks confusion with Microsoft Visio, the longtime diagram app, hinting that branding and polish sometimes play second fiddle to strategy.)

There’s also the question of interoperability: how well will Visio meetings work when French officials Zoom into a partner country’s conference, or vice versa? Will France demand that foreign delegations install its app, or allow links to other networks? The devil is in the details.

Some critics fret that an insular approach could fragment standards. One EU paper urges that sovereignty shouldn’t mean isolation but rather a robust, open ecosystem.

If every country builds its own siloed cloud and chat service, the Internet risks reinventing wheels (and reinventing firewalls) in every member state. Of course, Visio is only for civil servants, not a consumer product, yet it sets a precedent.

On the other hand, an expertly executed French stack could jumpstart a continental open-source community or spur startups to plug gaps. It’s a calculated gamble: France assumes that on net, its security and strategic stakes outweigh any shortfall in bells and whistles.

For its part, France says this isn’t a bare-bones trade-off. Officials emphasize Visio will include modern features: speaker separation, AI for transcripts, captions, etc. The goal is “not [a] minimalist replacement,” but a full-featured tool under domestic control.

In other words, they aim for the best of both worlds, though acknowledging it’s a tall order.

In its own softly decisive way, France’s Visio plan signals a definitive shift: digital sovereignty is no longer a future wish or empty catchphrase, but a deadline-driven program.

Europe has debated “strategic autonomy” for years; this is the first major state-level bet, with clear timelines and budget line savings. From the perspective of a tech editor watching policy trends, it’s heartening to see ambition meet action.

Will it pay off? If Visio runs smoothly, France will score a coup: more secure chats, money saved, and perhaps the bragging rights of a proof of concept. If glitches persist, France’s analysts may ask if the Q1 rollout to 200,000 civil servants is biting off too much too soon.

Either way, the move puts stakes on the table. Digital sovereignty has many meanings, but here it means doing something concrete, even if it means saying “non” to familiar tools.

In the end, it’s a balancing act. Europe gains control of what it might risk in convenience. France has just turned insurance talk into policy practice. Other countries will now watch and learn: Visio is not just a video app; it’s France’s case study in what digital independence can actually look like.
