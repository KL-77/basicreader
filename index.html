            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2026/02/interview-civilization-viis-devs-on-the-big-update-meant-to-win-critics-back/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">It has been difficult at times for new mainline releases in the Civilization series of games to win over new players right out of the gate. For Civilization VII—which launched just shy of one year ago—the struggles seemed to go deeper, with some players saying it didn’t feel like a Civilization game.

Civ VII’s developers, Firaxis Games, announced today it is planning an update this spring called “Test of Time” that rethinks a few unpopular changes, in some cases replacing key mechanics from the original release.

I spoke with Ed Beach, the Civilization franchise’s creative director, as well as Dennis Shirk, its executive producer, about what’s changing, the team’s interpretation of the player backlash to the choices in the initial release, and Firaxis and 2K’s plans for the future of the Civilization model.

There were of course bugs, balance issues, and missing documentation and UI features, and there have been updates to address some of those issues, with more to come.

For example, I asked about two oft-requested features: a city connections view, and the classic hot seat local multiplayer mode.

Beach said a connections view is in the works, though it will come after the big spring update. As for hot seat, he said that “there are some key members of our development team who feel passionately about getting that out.”

Shirk promised that’s coming too, but declined to say when.

But the real heart of the controversy is that Civ VII broke with what a lot of players considered core DNA for the series.

“We introduced all these great new mechanics because we wanted to give our players something new to chew on because they had something very similar from IV or V to VI,” said Shirk. “It was like if we were making Madden and we decided they’re going to play with a soccer ball instead of a football.”

For example, Civ VII lets players play any historical leader with any civilization and requires them to leave behind their initial civilization pick in favor of a new one mid-game—not just once, but twice, at the beginning of the second and third ages, phases of play with distinct tech trees and mechanics.

“I am a huge fan of British history, and so going from the Romans to the Normans to a Great Britain, that feels very natural to me. But it’s not natural to everybody,” Beach said. “As soon as you introduce those type of civ changes and the mixing and mashing with any leader, all of a sudden I think there’s an immersion element.

“We got feedback in some of our focus testing before the game shipped that there was going to be some level of controversy here, but we didn’t realize quite how strongly players identified with the idea of, ‘I need to take some people and grow them and have that specific civilization cultural set be what’s growing to face the challenges of world history,’” he added.

I mentioned prior big changes, like the switch in Civ V from the series’ classic “stacks of doom” military gameplay to a more granular, one-unit-one-tile approach to combat, and asked why the changes in Civ VII were so much more divisive than something like that.

“The difference… was the immersive storytelling versus the mechanics,” Shirk explained. Features like one-unit-one-tile “were mechanical changes that did not impact the immersion, the emotional storytelling that you’re telling yourself in your head.”

“It’s not all about the mechanics,” he said. “It’s about the game that players want to build for themselves.”

Starting with the Test of Time update, players will have the option to play one civilization through all three of the game’s ages. Each civ will have an apex age when it will have access to its full kit. In other ages, it will keep some of its kit, but it will also gain an age-appropriate culture tree, and the player will be able to use a new system to give their civ access to unique units or infrastructure from another civilization that would call the current age its apex.

At the start of an age, AI leaders will follow the player’s lead—if the player decides to stick with their existing civ, the others will stay, too. If they decide to switch to a new one, the AI will be able to do the same.

The idea is that this allows for players to not only pick which approach suits their preferences, but to change their mind mid-game, without a lock-in from the game settings at initialization.

The update will also rethink both how victory works in the game, and the controversial legacy paths system, which saw players trying to achieve linear, prescribed goals within each age to gain bonuses for the following one (or in the case of the modern age, to win in the end).

Whereas the base game delayed any direct work on victories until the third and final age (modern), Test of Time will let players begin making progress toward a victory from the very first age (antiquity), and if they manage to take a very strong lead, it will actually be possible to win the game outright in the second age (exploration).

As before, there will be four victory conditions, but a few will be rethought for this new context. The cultural victory will be achieved through a custom combination of wonders, great works, celebrations, and more. Military will remain focused on conquering cities and towns. Economic will, like culture, add up a bunch of things, including resources, gold buildings, factories, and treasure convoys. And the scientific victory will remain a space race.

Additionally, Firaxis is removing the concept of legacy paths from the game completely. It will be replaced with a new system called “triumphs.”

Firaxis’ goal here is to make the gameplay more of a sandbox like prior titles, with less rigidity in how players work their way toward success.

Instead of following a preset sequence of goals, the player will pick and choose from a large menu of possible accomplishments, each of which is associated with the six leader attributes: cultural, military, economic, scientific, diplomatic, and expansionist. Completing a triumph will either give players an immediate reward or a card they can use to set themselves up at the start of the next age.

Examples include milestones like reaching 200 population, being the first to build a university, claiming most of the world’s natural wonders, or being at war with every other civilization.

Beach explained his thinking on triumphs. “We purposely set it up so, rather than like pathways through an age, we’re looking at it sort of like as a constellation of objectives, and you choose four or five of those guide stars to move towards,” he said. “But they’re varied enough and they’re difficult enough that there’s no way you can complete all of them.”

There will be default rewards that players can claim at Age transition even if they don’t achieve any triumphs at all, an affordance Beach says is for beginner players.

During development, triumphs were considered alongside a very different alternative: simply doubling the number of legacy paths—two culture, two economic, two military, and two science. “But we look at that versus this sort of more open-ended triumph system, and we liked the open-endedness of it,” Beach said.

Triumphs are also designed in such a way that modders will be able to “easily” add them to the game. Firaxis is also workshopping something called “triumph sets,” which would allow players to configure their game at the start with specific limited packages of possible triumphs tailored to certain playstyles or challenges.

“We have [players] that are saying, I’d love it if you actually randomized the triumphs so I don’t even know going into the game which ones I’m going to be presented with,” Beach said. “We’re holding off on that for right now. That’s sort of a future idea.”

These are big changes that aim to walk the line of retaining what makes VII unique, while satisfying players of V and VI who felt it went way too far.

Civilization creator Sid Meier famously had a rule for sequels: 33 percent of a new game should retain systems that were established in the prior entry, 33 percent should substantially improve prior systems, and 33 percent should be brand-new systems and mechanics.

“I actually was challenged by my design team, and they wanted to change even more, way blowing past that 33-33-33 rule,” said Beach. “I would actually numerically try to add up how much change we were talking about and demonstrate to them that we had blown way past those guidelines and start to try to rein them in and say, well, out of these systems that we want to make updates to, let’s pull back a couple of these and keep a couple of them the same because we’re just overdoing it in terms of how innovative we want to be here.”

He said that in the end, “we still probably violated the 33-33-33 rule by going a little bit heavier into a new approach to everything, but there were some things we really wanted to tackle.”

Beach and Shirk explained a little bit about how the game ended up where it did.

“I think part of that comes out of Civ VI being the longest development cycle we’ve ever had before,” Beach said. The team worked on that entry in some way or another for roughly 11 years.

Going into VII, “we spent longer on our postmortem than we ever had before,” Beach recalled. “We had whiteboards filled with thoughts on every single system and what was good about it and what wasn’t good about it.”

“We wanted to tackle that late game problem of the combinatorial explosion,” he explained—referring to how some players of prior Civ games felt that the amount of things to control becomes unwieldy toward the end of a long playthrough, thanks to “so many cities to manage, so many units to manage, too much micromanagement.”

“We just saw a lot of data about people never finishing games and just deciding at some point, I’ve gotten what I can out of this game, this game is now a chore,” he said.

The team also wanted to make the game more modular and extensible, so it would be easier to design and add new systems post-launch. He cited frustrations working on Civ VI, where the combinatorial explosion problem was already so significant that it became a deterrent to adding new things to the game.

Based on Firaxis’ experience with Civ VII‘s reception, the studio is trying some new things to incorporate player feedback earlier in the development process for new mechanics or systems.

“It’s the worst-kept secret in the world that we’ve had this external test team for quite a few years called our Frankenstein Group,” noted Beach. It’s a small group of people—fewer than 50—who help test out new ideas and give feedback.

Now, that’s being expanded with a workshop program facilitated by publisher 2K that loops in many more members of the game’s community for play sessions and feedback rounds.

Shirk said this is a big departure from how things were done in the Civ V and Civ VI eras. With V, the team would release an update, then browse Reddit and sites like CivFanatics to see the reception. “In VI, we actually got to introduce more data and telemetry just to see how players were playing, but still a lot of us just looking at the forums,” he added.

I asked if Firaxis and 2K would consider the early access model, which is more typical for non-AAA games, for future Civ titles. “It’s one of those things that you can never say never,” Shirk responded. “As developers, we’re always looking at that jealously because we see that it’s a great opportunity.”

Both Beach and Shirk claimed that the audience of Civilization has expanded significantly over the past few games. You can’t please everyone, but more than most other games in the 4X or grand strategy genre that can be satisfied with serving a niche, Civilization—a franchise that has intermittently been the gold standard of genre across its 35-year history—has to try.</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Back in November, Cities: Skylines 2 publisher Paradox made the surprising announcement that longtime series developer Colossal Order would be ceasing work on the series as part of a “mutual” breakup. Now, we’re getting our first glimpse into the kinds of patches and upgrades new developer Iceflake (Surviving the Aftermath) is prioritizing for the popular city-builder going forward.

In a City Corner Developer Diary posted late last week, Iceflake focuses mainly on the visual improvements it’s planning for its first major Cities: Skylines 2 patch. Chief among these is improvements to the game’s user interface that Iceflake admits can “sometimes be a bit confusing when it comes to communicating things.”

The new patch will include a “streamlined” onboarding process for new cities, more expressive and context-aware icons, and toolbars with clearer colors and visual style. A new in-game Encyclopedia will also let players search through information about different gameplay topics, though that feature likely won’t be ready for Iceflake’s first patch.

As far as the look of the cities themselves, Iceflake says it’s taking inspiration from an existing “recolor” patch, integrating the ability to set custom colors for buildings, props, and vehicles into the base game. Players will eventually be able to recolor trees, plants, and other props as well, but this will also have to wait for a later patch.

The game’s weather systems will also be getting an overhaul, with easier customization options to get a distinct look and feel based on location. That includes snow that’s more likely to fall on boreal maps that also will coat a city’s rooftops and lawns with a solid white blanket. Players will also be able to directly control cloud cover and should be able to see a direct effect on the lighting and fog levels as they do.

Iceflake says it plans to publish another developer diary focusing on mechanical and gameplay updates and bug fixes before rolling out its first patch by the second half of February “if all goes well.” Longtime series fans can only hope that things do go well under the new development order, long after the game’s 2023 launch was hampered by performance issues and missing features that the community is still unhappy about.</div>

            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2026/02/narwhals-become-quieter-as-the-arctic-ocean-grows-louder/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">For most of their evolutionary history, narwhals have relied more on sound than sight to survive in the Arctic’s dark icy waters.

The speckled toothed whales—sometimes referred to as “unicorns of the sea” for the long, spiral tusks that protrude from the heads of males—navigate, hunt, and communicate using echolocation. By emitting a series of calls, whistles, and high frequency clicks—as many as a thousand per second—and listening for the echoes that bounce back, they are able to locate prey hundreds to thousands of feet deep and detect narrow cracks in sea ice where they can surface to breathe.

But as global temperatures continue to rise, the acoustic world narwhals depend on is rapidly shifting throughout their range, from northeastern Canada and Greenland to Norway’s Svalbard archipelago and Arctic waters in Russia. It’s getting louder.

The Arctic is warming at least three times faster than the rest of the planet, and as sea ice continues to shrink, vast stretches of ocean, once inaccessible to most humans, are opening up. Over the past decade, cargo vessels, fishing fleets, cruise ships, and oil and gas tankers have started moving through the region with increasing frequency and ease.

Throughout their journeys, they generate disturbing levels of noise that mask the sounds made by narwhals, as well as their hearing.

“Underwater noise is a growing problem, contributing to serious impact on the Arctic ecosystem,” said Sarah Bobbe, senior manager in the Arctic program at Ocean Conservancy, in a statement.

Other whales that are endemic to the Arctic, including belugas and bowheads, are in jeopardy, too.

“We know that all three species are sensitive to underwater noise produced by ships,” said Melanie Lancaster, senior specialist for Arctic species for the global Arctic program at the World Wide Fund for Nature, better known as WWF. “Even small amounts of noise can have large impacts on these species.”

Last month, that growing threat was a central topic at a multi-day meeting convened in London by the International Maritime Organization (IMO)—a United Nations body that regulates global shipping—where they reviewed recent research on the impact of ocean noise pollution on marine life and discussed methods and technologies for reducing it.

“Member states agreed on clear guidance on how we must reduce underwater noise pollution,” Bobbe said.

A mix of improved ship design, regular maintenance, and stronger regulations could significantly help tackle the problem, according to the Ocean Conservancy, which has been working with the IMO to push for mandatory rules that oblige commercial vessels to reduce their noise emissions. Currently, the IMO relies on voluntary guidelines encouraging quieter ship design and operation, which conservation advocates say are not adequate.

“We need to take action now,” Lancaster said. “If we carry on with no regulation of underwater noise in Arctic waters, by 2030 the amount of noise from shipping will nearly quadruple.”

A recent analysis by WWF found that the number of crude oil and gas tankers operating in Arctic waters has doubled over the past decade. Traffic from liquefied natural gas carriers has grown even faster, climbing to about 120 vessels in 2024, up from just 44 in 2014.

Various technologies exist that can help reduce shipping noise. Quieter propellers can be installed on both new and older vessels, for instance. Keeping ship hulls clean and improving engine insulation can further cut noise.

One of the most effective strategies for quieting a vessel is slowing down. Lower speeds not only reduce underwater noise, but also reduce the risk of collisions with whales like bowheads, which are particularly susceptible to ship strikes, Lancaster said. Ship operators also benefit.

“There’s less fuel burned. There’s more energy efficiency. There’s fewer emissions,” she said.

Ahead of January’s meeting, WWF submitted a paper to the IMO outlining how ships could also reduce their impact on whales by accounting for key migratory routes and avoiding them.

Narwhals, belugas, and bowhead whales travel thousands of kilometers across the Arctic Ocean each spring and autumn to reach seasonal feeding and breeding grounds. In summer, for example, female narwhals gather in sheltered fjords, sounds, and bays, where calm conditions provide safe places to give birth and raise calves. In winter, the animals migrate to deeper waters to pursue dense concentrations of prey.

WWF has mapped many of these pathways, which it refers to as Arctic “blue corridors,” and shared them with the IMO to help guide ship operators. Existing IMO guidelines already call on mariners to take special care around sensitive habitats, including migration routes, but conservation groups say more awareness is needed of where and when whales are likely to be present so companies and captains can plan accordingly.

If concrete measures are not adopted to limit the impacts of vessel traffic, underwater noise will continue to hurt whales, as well as other marine life, including fish and crustaceans, Lancaster said. Indigenous communities that rely on these marine ecosystems for food security may also be harmed.

Inuit communities in Canada and Greenland, for example, have hunted narwhals for generations to help sustain families through long winters and withstand a high cost of living in the region, according to Alex Ootoowak, an Inuk hunter who recently helped conduct a multi-year study of narwhals’ responses to shipping traffic in Eclipse Sound. That is a critically important summer calving ground for a distinct population of narwhal in Nunavut, Canada.

The study, led by researchers from the Scripps Institution of Oceanography at the University of California San Diego and Canadian marine conservation nonprofit Oceans North, found narwhals went silent when ships were passing.

“These animals are hearing and responding to ships from distances much further than we would have predicted,” said Joshua Jones, one of the study’s authors. “We learned that narwhals go quiet or move away when a ship is within about 20 kilometers of the site.” They also stopped eating.

“They stopped doing their deep dives to the bottom to feed during a ship transit,” said Ootoowak.

In Eclipse Sound, much of the vessel traffic is driven by industrial shipping linked to the Mary River Mine, a large iron ore operation on Baffin Island operated by Baffinland Iron Mines Corp., Ootoowak said. The number of tourism vessels, such as cruise ships, private yachts, sailboats, and speed boats that visit the area is also rising.

“We’re getting about 30 cruise ships a year now,” Ootoowak said. “Our waters are a lot louder than they traditionally were.”

With so much traffic and noise, Ootoowak said he worries narwhals may be abandoning their traditional calving grounds for quieter waters. Neighboring communities in Greenland are already reporting what they describe as “foreign narwhals” appearing in their waters—animals, Ootoowak said, that match the behavior and appearance of those from Eclipse Sound.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">If all goes according to plan Monday, NASA’s launch team at Kennedy Space Center in Florida will load 755,000 gallons of super-cold propellants into the rocket built to send the Artemis II mission toward the Moon.

The fuel loading is part of a simulated countdown for the Space Launch System rocket, a final opportunity for engineers to rehearse for the day NASA will send four astronauts on a nearly 10-day voyage around the far side of the Moon and back to Earth. The Artemis II mission will send humans farther from Earth than ever before. The astronauts will be the first to launch on NASA’s SLS rocket and the first people to travel to the vicinity of the Moon in more than 53 years.

Charlie Blackwell-Thompson, NASA’s launch director for the Artemis II mission, will supervise the practice countdown from a firing room inside the Launch Control Center a few miles away from the SLS rocket at Kennedy Space Center. In a recent briefing with reporters, she called the Wet Dress Rehearsal—&quot;wet” refers to the loading of liquid propellants—the “best risk reduction test” for verifying all is ready to proceed into the real countdown.

NASA delayed the rehearsal two days to avoid performing the test amid a spell of unusually cold freezing temperatures in Central Florida. Although the fueling test could have safely gone ahead, the temperatures would have violated cold weather restrictions for launching the Artemis II mission. A NASA spokesperson told Ars that officials wanted to run the countdown simulation in more realistic conditions they might actually see on launch day.

No astronauts will be aboard the Orion spacecraft mounted on top of the SLS rocket for the simulated countdown. Much of everything else will have the feeling of launch day. A successful fuel loading and smooth countdown would clear the way for launch of the Artemis II mission as soon as next Sunday, February 8.

If things do not go so well, NASA’s chances for launching Artemis II this month will likely wither away. NASA only has a handful of launch opportunities each month where everything lines up for Artemis II’s flight around the Moon. The first two of this month’s launch dates, February 6 and 7, are no longer an option after NASA ordered the two-day delay in this week’s practice countdown. Here are the three launch opportunities still available this month, each with a two-hour launch window:

If NASA misses this month’s launch opportunities, the next chance to send Artemis II to the Moon will be March 6. NASA has released this chart showing all available Artemis II launch dates through the end of April.

“Wet dress is the driver to launch. We need to get through wet dress,” Blackwell-Thompson said. “We need to see what lessons that we learn as a result of that, and that will ultimately lay out the path toward launch.”

The Artemis II mission comes more than two years after NASA launched Artemis I, the first unpiloted test flight of the Space Launch System rocket.

It took four tries for NASA to fully load propellants onto the first SLS rocket during a series of Wet Dress Rehearsals (WDRs) in 2022. None of the practice runs were free of problems. The list of technical snags included difficulties supplying gaseous nitrogen to the launch pad, problems keeping liquid oxygen at the proper temperature, and a series of valve and seal failures that led to persistent leaks of hydrogen fuel.

Molecular hydrogen is notoriously difficult to wrangle. It is highly flammable, and the molecule’s fantastically low mass and tiny dimension make it hard to contain. The cryogenic temperature of the liquified form of hydrogen is an additional complication. Liquid hydrogen must be kept at temperatures around minus 423° Fahrenheit (minus 253° Celsius), cold enough to freeze solid any gas it comes in contact with except for helium.

When liquid hydrogen hits seals and gaskets, the materials can change their shape and size, creating leak paths that escape detection at ambient temperatures. That happened repeatedly during multiple countdowns preceding the Artemis I launch, unseating seals in the hydrogen fueling line between the SLS core stage and its ground launch platform.

Finally, engineers devised what they called a “kinder, gentler” approach to ramping up pressures and hydrogen flow rates into the SLS rocket. The revised procedure wasn’t perfect, and it added some time to the fueling timeline, but it worked well enough to allow NASA to successfully launch the Artemis I mission in November 2022.

NASA will use the same fueling procedure for Artemis II. “We believe that issue has been put to bed,” Blackwell-Thompson said.

“Artemis I was a test flight, and we learned a lot during that campaign, getting to launch,” she said. “And the things that we’ve learned relative to how to go load this vehicle, how to load LOX (liquid oxygen), how to load hydrogen, have all been rolled in to the way in which we intend to go load the Artemis II vehicle.”

There are more changes to the launch countdown sequence for Artemis II because the astronauts will need to board the Orion spacecraft after the rocket is fully fueled. The crew will not be present Monday, but the rehearsal will include a built-in pause when the astronauts would climb into the spacecraft on launch day.

The additional time adds to what was already a lengthy countdown. The WDR officially kicked off Saturday night with the start of a two-day countdown clock, but the most critical moments will begin Monday morning.

The clock is ticking toward a simulated launch time of 9:00 pm EST Monday (02:00 UTC Tuesday). Preparations for filling the rocket with propellant will begin about 10 hours before then, around 11:00 am EST, with thermal conditioning of the core stage tanks to receive their cryogenic contents.

Once the tanks are properly chilled down to cryogenic temperatures, liquid hydrogen should start flowing into the core stage at around 11:35 am EST, followed 15 minutes later by the start of liquid oxygen loading. The launch team will ramp up flow rates to “fast fill” mode on both tanks sometime around 12:00 pm EST. This will be one of the most critical phases of Monday’s test, when engineers watch for buildups of hydrogen around the fueling connector near the bottom of the rocket.

NASA is streaming a live view of the 322-foot-tall (98-meter) rocket on its launch pad in Florida, but the agency is not planning to provide realtime commentary on the video feed Monday. Officials said they will release updates throughout the day on social media.

It will take about three hours to fill both tanks on the SLS core stage. Liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen will begin pumping into the rocket’s upper stage soon after the start of core stage loading. If the countdown remains on track, the rocket should be fully fueled soon after 4:00 pm EST. That’s when NASA will dispatch the closeout crew to the launch pad to close the hatch to the Orion spacecraft, just as they will on launch day. Throughout it all, the rocket will slowly be replenished with propellant as the super-cold liquids boil off.

Once the pad crew evacuates to a safe distance, Blackwell-Thompson will poll her team for authorization to commence the final 10 minutes of the countdown. The automated countdown sequencer will oversee final steps to put the SLS rocket and Orion spacecraft into launch configuration, including the retraction of the crew access arm, transition from ground power to internal power supplies, and pressurization of the rocket’s propellant tanks.

The countdown will pause at T-minus 90 seconds for up to three minutes to verify the team’s ability to hold the clock in the final moments before liftoff. Then, the clock will tick down to T-minus 33 seconds before the countdown computer orders an automatic abort. During a real launch attempt, that is when control of the countdown would transition from a ground sequencer to the rocket’s onboard computer.

Mission managers plan to reset the clock at T-minus 10 minutes and commence a second run through the final countdown. The second run will give the launch team a chance to rehearse how they can recover from a last-minute abort and try to launch again on the same day.

All told, NASA says Monday night’s mock countdown may not be over until after midnight. At the end of the test, the launch team will drain the rocket of propellant and review the test’s results before setting an official target launch date for Artemis II, according to NASA.

More eyes than just those of NASA’s Artemis team will be closely watching the progress of Monday’s mock countdown. A few miles away from the Artemis launch pad, a separate team is preparing a SpaceX Crew Dragon spacecraft and Falcon 9 rocket to ferry the next long-duration crew to the International Space Station.

There’s some urgency in getting the next mission to the station after the early departure of the last crew due to a medical issue with one of the astronauts. That mission, designated Crew-11, undocked from the station and successfully splashed down in the Pacific Ocean on January 15, leaving the complex short-staffed with just one US astronaut and two Russian cosmonauts.

The four-person Crew-12 mission is next in line, with SpaceX and NASA aiming for a launch date as soon as February 11 from Space Launch Complex-40 at Cape Canaveral, Florida. The schedule for Crew-12 will ultimately hinge on when Artemis II flies.

Steve Stich, NASA’s commercial crew program manager, laid out the possibilities in a press conference Friday. NASA does not want to launch Crew-12 when Artemis II is in space for several reasons. The same group of Air Force pararescue personnel will be on standby to retrieve each astronaut crew in the event of an emergency during launch, and the flight paths of each mission require some of the units to stage in different locations. Both missions will also use the same fleet of NASA communications satellites for tracking and data relay services.

Artemis II will get first dibs on launch dates in early to mid February, Stich said. If NASA comes out of Monday’s rehearsal with a decision to move forward with Artemis II’s launch next Sunday, Crew-12 will stand down from the February 11 launch opportunity. If Artemis II gets off the ground Sunday, Crew-12 would wait until the Artemis astronauts are back on Earth. Assuming a full-duration mission, that would put the Crew-12 launch date around February 19, Stich said.

If NASA tries to launch Artemis II next Sunday but runs into a problem that grounds the mission, Crew-12 could be ready to go around February 13.

The convergence of the Artemis II and Crew-12 launch schedules adds another layer of importance to Monday’s countdown test at Kennedy Space Center. For the first time since the 1960s, NASA has separate astronaut crews simultaneously in preflight quarantine, a routine measure to prevent crew members from flying to space with an illness.

“We’ve laid out all the timelines relative to crew quarantine, when SpaceX will move their hardware to Pad 40, when we get into [our own rehearsals],” Stich said. “I would say those timelines will be a little dynamic, because in particular, if we get out to the launch pad and we’re trying to static fire around Artemis operations, we will work around Artemis in all those scenarios.”</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">When a new presidential administration comes in, it is responsible for filling around 4,000 jobs sprinkled across the federal government’s vast bureaucracy. These political appointees help carry out the president’s agenda, and, at least in theory, make government agencies responsive to elected officials.

Some of these roles—the secretary of state, for example—are well-known. Others, such as the deputy assistant secretary for textiles, consumer goods, materials, critical minerals & metals industry & analysis, are more obscure.

Historically, science agencies like NASA or the National Institutes of Health tend to have fewer political appointees than many other parts of the federal government. Sometimes, very senior roles—with authority over billions of dollars of spending, and the power to shape entire fields of research—are filled without any direct input from the White House or Congress. The arrangement reflects a long-running argument that scientists should oversee the work of funding and conducting research with very little interference from political leaders.

Since the early 2000s, according to federal employment records, NIH, the country’s premier biomedical research agency, has usually had just a few political appointees within its workforce. (As of November 2025, that workforce numbered around 17,500 people, after significant cuts.) Staff scientists and external experts played a key role in selecting the directors of the 27 institutes and centers that make up NIH. That left the selection of people for powerful positions largely outside of direct White House oversight.

What is the future of that status quo under the Trump administration?

Those questions have recently swirled at NIH. The arrival of political appointees in the kinds of positions previously held by civil servants, and apparent changes to hiring practices for other key positions, have raised concerns among current and former officials about a new era of politicization.

For decades, NIH has enjoyed strong bipartisan support. But conservative lawmakers have periodically raised questions about some of the agency’s spending, and according to one 2014 survey, the agency is perceived by federal executives as being a progressive place. (Since the early 2000s, some data suggests, US scientists as a whole have grown considerably more liberal relative to the general population.)

Since the COVID-19 pandemic, many conservatives have criticized NIH for funding the kind of controversial virology experiments that some experts believe may have started the pandemic, and for promoting public health strategies that many on the right viewed as unscientific and authoritarian. One of the NIH institute directors, Anthony Fauci, who led the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases from 1984 until his retirement in 2022, came to be a highly polarizing figure, described on the right as an unelected official wielding considerable power.

Over the years, some biomedical researchers have argued for changes to the way NIH hires and retains people in leadership positions. In 2019, the agency announced plans to impose term limits on some midlevel roles, in a bid to diversify its management. More recently, Johns Hopkins University physician and researcher Joseph Marine argued in an essay for The Free Press that NIH should set five to 10-year term limits on the directors of individual NIH institutes. “Regular turnover of leadership,” he wrote, “brings fresh ideas and a healthy reassessment of priorities.”

Shortly after winning the 2024 presidential election, Donald Trump tapped Jay Bhattacharya, a prominent critic of NIH, to lead the agency. It may not be entirely surprising that an administration advocating for reforms to NIH would seek to flip key management positions that often experience little turnover.

Former official Mike Lauer, who until early 2025 oversaw NIH’s vast external grants program, said there were signs before Trump’s second inauguration that institute directors might be subject to fresh political scrutiny.

“There was a frustration that so much of the agency’s direction, as well as financial decision-making, was being made by people who are outside of the political sphere,” Lauer told Undark. He pointed to a line in Project 2025, a proposed roadmap for the Trump administration that was produced by the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank. “Funding for scientific research,” the report argues, “should not be controlled by a small group of highly paid and unaccountable insiders at the NIH, many of whom stay in power for decades.”

Soon after Trump’s inauguration, some senior officials at NIH were put on administrative leave or abruptly departed, including Lawrence Tabak, who had spent more than a decade as principal deputy director and served as NIH’s interim leader for almost two years during the COVID-19 pandemic.

At the same time, the administration grew the number of political appointees at NIH. As of late June, according to federal records, the Trump administration had placed nine political appointees at the agency, up from four the year before—itself higher than in most previous years. One of them, Seana Cranston, is a former Republican Congressional staffer who serves as chief of staff to the NIH Director; her predecessor was a career civil servant who had spent nearly 40 years in the NIH, the last four as chief of staff. Another is Michael Allen, who took the role of chief operating officer for the $6.5 billion NIAID, Fauci’s former institute. (Allen was appointed with no official announcement, and appears to have no official biography or background information posted on NIH websites.)

Those numbers still left NIH with fewer political appointees than many other agencies, including NASA, a comparably sized science agency.

The administration has departed from the traditional process for hiring NIH’s 27 institute and center directors, who are responsible for overseeing most of the funding decisions and day-to-day operations of NIH.

In the spring of 2025, five of those directors—including the head of NIAID—were fired or placed on administrative leave. (They have all since been removed from their positions.)

Then, in September, part of the search committee for the National Institute of Mental Health was abruptly disbanded, and then just as suddenly reconvened, according to Joshua Gordon, the former head of that institute, and one other source close to NIH.

In October, the directorship of another agency, the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, was filled by a close personal friend of Vice President JD Vance, without any apparent search process — a move that multiple former NIH officials told Undark may be unprecedented.

By then, 13 other NIH institutes and centers had vacant leadership posts. Other roles have opened up more recently: In an email to NIH staff on Dec. 30, Bhattacharya announced the departure of Walter Koroshetz, leader of the agency’s main neuroscience research institute. In the email, Bhattacharya seemed to suggest he had opposed the decision: “Dr. Koroshetz’s performance as Director has been exceptional,” Bhattacharya wrote, but “the Department of Health and Human Services has elected to pursue a leadership transition.”

In early January, the Director of the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute announced his retirement, bringing the total number of open posts to 15.

The searches, NIH insiders say, appear to be happening on a compressed timeline. And while the NIH director has typically relied on search committees consisting of both NIH career scientists and external experts, multiple sources close to NIH say the agency has not formed those kinds of committees to make the latest round of hires.

In response to questions from Undark in early January, the Department of Health and Human Services sent a brief emailed statement, signed “NIH Press Team,” explaining that “an NIH leadership team with experience in scientific agency management will consider the applicant pool and make recommendations to the NIH Director.” The press representative declined to respond to follow-up questions about who would be on that team, or why the hiring process had changed.

Those changes have prompted speculation among some NIH insiders that the Trump administration is seeking to exert more political control over the hiring of directorships.

“Having external members on the search committee is vitally important for preventing politicization,” said Mark Histed, an NIH scientist who has recently been a critic — on his personal time, he stresses — of Trump’s approach to the agency. “Because, as you can imagine, if you’ve got a bunch of external scientists, it’s a lot harder to ram down what the White House wants, because people are not part of the political system.”

That kind of open and non-politicized search process, Histed said in a follow-up interview, isn’t unique to NIH: It’s one widely used by scientific institutions around the world. And it has worked, he argued, to help make NIH a scientific juggernaut: “That process,” he said, “led to 80 years of staggering scientific success.”

Members of Congress have taken notice. In language attached to the current appropriations bill moving through Congress, lawmakers direct NIH “to maintain its longstanding practice of including external scientists and stakeholders” in the search process. (Agencies are supposed to follow these Congressional instructions, but they are not binding.) In late January, Diana DeGette, a Democratic representative from Colorado, sponsored a bill that, according to a press release, would “Protect NIH From Political Interference” by, among other steps, capping the number of political appointees at the agency.

Lauer, the former NIH grants chief, took a broader historical view of the changes. There has long been a tug-of-war, he said, between presidential administrations that seek more political control over an agency, and civil servants and other bureaucratic experts who may resist that perceived incursion. From the point of view of politicians and their staff, Lauer said, “what they’ll say—I understand where they’re coming from—what they’ll say is, is that more political control means that the agency is going to be responsive to the will of the electorate, that there’s a greater degree of transparency and public accountability.”

Those upsides can be significant, Lauer said, but there are also downsides, including more short-term thinking, unstable budgets, and the potential loss of expertise and competence.

Mark Richardson, a political scientist at Georgetown University, is an expert on politicization and the federal bureaucracy. In his work, he said, he has observed a correlation between how much political parties disagree over the role of a specific agency, and the degree to which presidential administrations seek to exert control there through appointees and other personnel choices. NIH has historically fallen alongside agencies like the Bureau of Labor Statistics and the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office that are subject to broad alignment across the parties.

“I think what you’re seeing more with the Trump administration is kind of an expansion of political conflict to these types of agencies,” Richardson said.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Exterminators keep getting calls for a reason. Wood-devouring insects, such as beetles, termites, and carpenter ants, are constantly chewing through walls or infecting trees and breaking them down. The fight against these insects usually involved noxious insecticides; but now, at least some of them can be eliminated using a certain species of fungus.

Infestations of bark beetles are the bane of spruce trees. Eurasian spruce bark beetles (Ips typographus) ingest bark high in phenolic compounds, organic molecules that often act as antioxidants and antimicrobials. They protect spruce bark from pathogenic fungi—and the beetles take advantage. Their bodies boost the antimicrobial power of these compounds by turning them into substances that are even more toxic to fungi. This would seem to make the beetles invulnerable to fungi.

There is a way to get past the beetles’ borrowed defenses, though. Led by biochemist Ruo Sun, a team of researchers from the Max Planck Institute for Chemical Ecology in Jena, Germany, found that some strains of the fungus Beauveria bassiana are capable of infecting and killing the pests.

“Insect herbivores have long been known to accumulate plant defense metabolites from their diet as defenses against their own enemies,” she said in a study recently published in PNAS. “However, as shown here for B. bassiana, fungal pathogens are able to circumvent the toxicity of these dietary defenses and cause disease.”

Populations of bark beetles have recently exploded in temperate forests because of climate change. One species they feed on is the Norway spruce (Picea abies), which makes organic phenolic compounds known as stilbenes and flavonoids. Stilbenes are hydrocarbons that function as secondary metabolites for plants, and flavonoids, which are polyphenols, are also secondary plant metabolites that are often antioxidants. The spruce links both classes of compounds with sugars and relies on their antibacterial and antifungal activity.

When metabolized by the beetles, the spruce sugars are removed through hydrolysis, converting them into aglycones that are even more toxic to microscopic invaders. Despite that, some fungi appear to be able to deactivate these compounds. Strains of the fungal insect pathogen B. bassiana have been documented as killing some of these beetles in the wild.

Sun wanted to put this fungus to the test. While not all strains have been effective at eliminating bark beetles, she and her team extracted the fungus from beetles that had succumbed to it. They bred these strains in their lab to see how effective they would be against the insects. They identified the genes that gave these fungi their ability to metabolize phenolic compounds ingested by the beetles and detoxify them so they were no longer protective. They then experimented with knocking out these genes to see whether the mutant fungi would still be able to take down beetles.

Once beetles were infected with B. bassiana, the researchers found the fungus detoxifies protective compounds in two phases. The aglycones that were made so potent by the removal of sugars from spruce stilbenes and flavanoids are made weaker by having the sugar restored in the first phase. Methylation happens next. After this phase, the sugar is linked to a methyl group (CH3), forming a type of methylglucoside. This particular methylglucoside is harmless to the fungus. Mutant strains of the fungus that had their detoxification genes knocked out could not produce methylglucoside, so they were not as effective at infecting beetles and were nowhere near as lethal.

B. bassiana is not the only fungus that is capable of this detox. Other species, including the infamous Cordyceps militaris that terrorized a dystopian society in The Last of Us (though it will not turn people into fungus monsters), are capable of producing methylglucosides from stilbenes, flavonoids, and other compounds that are supposed to protect plants from infection and are borrowed by the insects that gorge on them.

“Besides direct detoxification, fungi such as B. bassiana could have other mechanisms of resisting plant defense compounds,” Sun said. “[Some] are known to excrete compounds like resveratrol from fungal cells, and so could also play a role in increasing fungal growth and virulence on substrates containing toxic compounds.”

Fungi could be weaponized as pest control in the future. The researchers think it is possible that the genes that enable B. bassiana to detoxify antifungal substances could enable it to metabolize other defensive plant substances ingested by harmful insects. Instead of sprayers full of dangerous chemicals, exterminators may soon arrive with petri dishes instead.</div>

            <div id="article-text">The enormous storms of impenetrable clouds covering Jupiter’s surface make it nearly impossible for us to get a glimpse of what lies below. Any spacecraft attempting to get a closer look would be vaporized, melted, or crushed if it attempted to sail through. NASA’s Galileo spacecraft, for instance, went dark almost immediately when it intentionally plunged into Jupiter’s atmosphere back in 2003.

While Jupiter — a giant ball of swirling gases and liquids — isn’t believed to have a true surface, scientists have been trying to get a better sense of its layers. Now, using data from NASA’s Juno and Galileo missions, a team of scientists at the space agency’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory and the University of Chicago have created a highly detailed computational model of Jupiter’s atmosphere.

And as detailed in a new paper, published in The Planetary Science Journal last month, they found something surprising down there: Jupiter appears to contain one-and-a-half times as much oxygen as the Sun — far more than previous estimates, which suggested it was only a third as much oxygen.

The findings also support the prevailing theory that Jupiter formed by accreting icy material billions of years ago near or past the “frost line,” as Space.com points out, meaning the distance from the Sun where temperatures are low enough for ammonia, methane, and water ice to form. (Whether the planet formed in its current orbit or much further away from the Sun before migrating to its current position over billions of years remains a topic of debate.)

Much of the oxygen is tied up in water as well, which changes its behavior drastically depending on temperature, further complicating our efforts to map out Jupiter’s layers.

The researchers’ computational model takes into account both the chemical reactions taking place — from extremely hot metal molecules deep inside the core and much cooler regions in its atmosphere — and the movement of gases, clouds and droplets.

“You need both,” said lead author and UChicago postdoctoral researcher Jeehyun Yang in a statement. “Chemistry is important but doesn’t include water droplets or cloud behavior. Hydrodynamics alone simplifies the chemistry too much. So, it’s important to bring them together.”

Their model suggests that gases move far more slowly through Jupiter’s atmosphere than previously thought.

“Our model suggests the diffusion would have to be 35 to 40 times slower compared to what the standard assumption has been,” Yang explained. “Instead of moving through an atmospheric layer in hours, a single molecule might take several weeks.”

It’s only one small part of a much larger mystery surrounding our solar system’s largest planet — and its more-than-intriguing collection of moons. The angry gas giant of swirling gases continues to baffle even top scientists.

“It really shows how much we still have to learn about planets, even in our own solar system,” Yang said.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">We’ve come across video after video of humanoid robots performing backflips, delivering punches — and even a clip of a robot kicking the CEO of its maker squarely in the chest.

Don’t get us wrong, the aerobatics on display are impressive — but it’s not hugely practical, since it’s not like we’re being swarmed by waves of armed bad guys on a daily basis.

Fortunately, not every robotics maker is doubling down on martial arts. Case in point, California-based company Figure recently introduced the second iteration of its humanoid robot AI software, called Helix 02. In a video released this week, the company’s black-and-white android, dubbed Figure 02, can be seen seamlessly unloading a dishwasher and placing clean dishes in upper cabinets and drawers before loading dirty dishes back into it.

It’s an impressive demo. Certain human-like flourishes highlight how Helix 02 was relying on motion-captured training data, from using its foot to kick up the opened dishwasher door to bumping a drawer closed with its hip.

The company claims in a press release that a “single neural system” can control the “full body directly from pixels, enabling dexterous, long horizon autonomy across an entire room.”

The dishwasher demonstration is a “four-minute, end-to-end autonomous task that integrates walking, manipulation, and balance with no resets and no human intervention,” per Figure. “We believe this is the longest horizon, most complex task completed autonomously by a humanoid robot to date.”

Helix 02’s dishwasher mastery was the result of being trained on over 1,000 hours of “human motion data and sim‑to‑real reinforcement learning,” the company claimed. And it’s not a one-hit wonder: we’ve already seen Figure 02 deftly sort packages at a logistics warehouse, load a washing machine, and even fold laundry.

However, how the robot would fare in a different — and perhaps far messier — kitchen remains to be seen. Flashy tech demos like this one should always be taken with a grain of salt, particularly when they’re meant to convey how robots could one day navigate an unpredictable real-world environment, rather than a carefully set-up and controlled stage.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">New York City’s mayor isn’t even a month into his term, and he’s already delivering a crushing blow to delivery app companies.

In a bombshell intervention, Zohran Mamdani and Department of Consumer and Worker Protection commissioner Sam Levine announced that three delivery apps will be forced to repay $4.6 million in wages held back from deliveristas, New York City’s app-based delivery workers.

According to NYC Streetblog, the three main culprits being forced to settle are Uber Eats, Fantuan, and Hungry Panda. The three settlements were the result of a sweeping investigation into broader delivery app practices, which included GrubHub and DoorDash.

“The era of giant corporations juicing profits by underpaying workers is over,” Levine said in a statement. “I’m proud that this agency is not only returning full back pay, but is recovering damages and penalties to send a strong message that cheating workers will not be tolerated.”

Per the mayoral administration, Uber Eats unfairly deactivated and underpaid thousands of workers between December 4, 2023, and September 2, 2024. It’s now being forced to pay $3,150,000 in worker relief penalties across over 48,000 workers, in amounts ranging from $8.79 to $276.15.

In addition, Uber Eats will have to pay the city of New York $350,000 in civil fines — a drop in the bucket compared to the $13.7 billion in revenue the company brought in throughout 2024, but a win for the worker-friendly administration all the same.

The decision strikes a major blow to an industry that has historically relied on its political and financial largess to avoid consequences for horrifying worker abuses resulting from algorithmic management systems.

“For years, app companies treated the law as optional — hiding behind algorithms, stealing wages, and deactivating workers without consequence,” Ligia Guallpa, executive director of the Workers’ Justice Project, told NYC Streetblog in a statement. “The scale of these abuses proves what deliveristas have been saying for years: exploitation is not an accident — it’s baked into the app delivery business model.”

James Parrott, a senior fellow at the Center for New York City Affairs at The New School, concurred.

“For far too long, delivery and other online labor platform companies have not only underpaid workers, but deactivated them with abandon, denying workers the ability to make a living,” he said.

Perhaps surprisingly, Uber hasn’t denied any wrongdoing and went as far as to thank officials for bringing light to the issue.

In a statement to NYC Streetblog, Uber spokesman Josh Gold said that “we’re glad to have this resolved.”

“After DCWP notified us of the issue in August 2024, we immediately corrected it, agreed to pay more than the amount owed, and appreciate the new administration moving quickly to bring this to a fair conclusion,” he said.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">We’ve seen plenty of evidence suggesting that prolonged use of popular AI chatbots like ChatGPT can coax some users into spirals of paranoid and delusional behavior.

The phenomenon, dubbed “AI psychosis,” is a very real problem, with researchers warning of a huge wave of severe mental health crises brought on by the tech. In extreme cases, especially involving people with pre-existing conditions, the breaks with reality have even been linked suicides and murder.

Now, thanks to a yet-to-be-peer-reviewed paper published by researchers at Anthropic and the University of Toronto, we’re beginning to grasp just how widespread the issue really is.

The researchers set out to quantify patterns of what they called “user disempowerment” in “real-world [large language model] usage” — including what they call “reality distortion,” “belief distortion,” and “action distortion” to denote a range of situations in which AI twists users’ sense of reality, beliefs, or pushes them into taking actions.

The results tell a damning story. The researchers found that one in 1,300 conversations out of almost 1.5 million analyzed chats with Anthropic’s Claude led to reality distortion, and one in 6,000 conversations led to action distortion.

To come to their conclusion, the researchers ran 1.5 million Claude conversations through an analysis tool called Clio to identify instances of “disempowerment.”

On the face, that may not sound like a huge proportion given the scale of the much larger dataset — but in absolute numbers, the research highlights a phenomenon that’s affecting huge numbers of people.

“We find the rates of severe disempowerment potential are relatively low,” the researchers concluded. “For instance, severe reality distortion potential, the most common severe-level primitive, occurs in fewer than one in every thousand conversations.”

“Nevertheless, given the scale of AI usage, even these low rates translate to meaningful absolute numbers,” they added. “Our findings highlight the need for AI systems designed to robustly support human autonomy and flourishing.”

Worse yet, they found evidence that the prevalence of moderate or severe disempowerment increased between late 2024 and late 2025, indicating that the problem is growing as AI use spreads.

“As exposure grows, users might become more comfortable discussing vulnerable topics or seeking advice,” the researchers wrote in the blog post.

Additionally, the team found that user feedback — in the form of an optional thumbs up or down button at the end of a given conversation with Claude — indicated that users “rate potentially disempowering interactions more favorably,” according to an accompanying blog post on Anthropic’s website.

In other words, users are more likely to come away satisfied when their reality or beliefs are being distorted, highlighting the role of sycophancy, or the strong tendency of AI chatbots to validate a user’s feelings and beliefs.

Plenty of fundamental questions remain. The researchers were upfront about admitting that they “can’t pinpoint why” the prevalence of moderate or severe disempowerment potential is growing. Their dataset is also limited to Claude consumer traffic, “which limits generalizability.” We also don’t know how many of these identified cases led to real-world harm, as the research only focused on “disempowerment potential” and not “confirmed harm.”

The team called for improved “user education” to make sure people aren’t giving up their full judgment to AI as “model-side interventions are unlikely to fully address the problem.”

Nonetheless, the researchers say the research is only a “first step” to learn how “AI might undermine human agency.”

“We can only address these patterns if we can measure them,” they argued.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">For years, the cultivated meat industry has struggled to emerge as a practical alternative to the brutal factory farming sector. The key reason? Perhaps not that lab grown meat isn’t a viable product, but that intense regulations have strangled it in the cradle.

A new analysis by the food industry publication Just Food found that the majority of cultivated meat companies — those working to bring cell-cultured meat to market — have struggled thanks to a lack of regulatory approvals from government food agencies. Despite a ton of early investor interest in these kinds of companies and an increasingly competitive price point, many are being forced to shutter operations before they can get a product to shelves.

“While it’s disappointing to see company closures, as with any highly innovative sector, not all companies will make it through the tough early stages,” Carlotte Lucas, industry head at Good Food Institute Europe told Just Food.

“However, regulatory inefficiencies, such as longer, unpredictable approval times, have been a critical barrier for companies hoping to bring products to market and have led to some start-ups considering other regions or even relocating overseas,” Lucas continued.

Without regulatory approval in regions like Europe and North America, lab-grown meat startups can’t scale their operations into the kinds of consumer markets that have expressed interest in alternative meats. Instead, they tend to find niche buyers in the restaurant industry, with mixed success.

“While the regulatory work is essential, it’s very resource intensive, it’s very time intensive, and each player needs to go through that process,” Erika Georget, managing director of The Cultured Hub told Just Food.

Georget suggests that scaling up biomass production is essential for success in the lab-grown meat industry — biomass referring to the animal cells utilized in growing cultivated meat. It puts lab-grown meat companies in a paradoxical bind: startups need regulatory approval to scale commercially, but also need commercial scale to survive the regulatory process.

“Even for those that have had approval for restaurants and so on, a challenge is that companies don’t have enough quantity yet to really serve a classical retail business and at an acceptable cost based on pure biomass,” Georget told the outlet.

Until regulators create clearer, faster pathways to approval, cultivated meat risks becoming a cautionary tale of urgently-needed innovation killed by bureaucratic overreach.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">A couple says their Tesla Cybertruck nearly dumped their baby onto the side of the highway after its passenger door latch failed, The Oaklandside reports.

The husband, Oakland resident Viral Shah, says he and his wife were driving up a ramp to get on the highway when the back passenger door next to their one-year-old child suddenly swung open. Shah and his wife screamed and immediately pulled over to check on their kid. Fortunately, the car seat saved the baby from being flung out the car, but it was an alarmingly close call. And had the 60-pound stainless steel-clad door swung back closed, it could have smashed the child’s hand or arm.

If anyone had been sitting back there without a seatbelt, Shah told The Oaklandside, “they would’ve been mush on the street.” His wife had to take the child’s seat, buckle herself in, and hold the door closed for the rest of the drive home. ​​”This is f*cking nuts,” she said, Shah recalled.

Upon inspecting the passenger door, Shah discovered that the metal loop that the car door latch hooked into, called a striker, was missing one of its two screws and had come loose. He also found that the driver door had a screw loose as well. Alarmed, he submitted a complaint to the National High Traffic Safety Administration.

“That’s what made me really scared and furious, because this wasn’t a simple defect,” he told The Oaklandside. “This wasn’t an oversight with one thing where shit happens. This was a systemic design flaw that was affecting those two doors because they were the most heavily used.”

“There’s no doubt in my mind the same thing would happen to all four doors had they been used with the same level of frequency,” he added.

An expert who reviewed photos and videos taken by Shah and his wife suspected that the “weld-nuts” on the backside of the door’s steel pillar appeared to improperly welded, gradually dislodging as the doors were shut.

“This should never, ever happen, but weld-nuts do occasionally break free if there is a process or setup error in the welding equipment or if protective coatings that are used to limit corrosion during shipping of parts are not properly cleaned,” Sam Abuelsamid, a car engineer and vice president of market research at Telemetry, told Oaklandside.

The Cybertruck has been recalled a staggering ten times, a number that probably flatters the vehicle, as it has been accused of all kinds of serious reliability issues beyond those that became official record. Many of the recalls, in any case, were pretty serious. One was for its accelerator pedal getting stuck in the down position, and another was for losing power while driving. It’s also been recalled for other body-related issues, including its stainless steel panels flying off because they were adhered with crummy glue.

The latches aren’t the only apparent issue. Other aspects of the electric doors, which do not have a traditional handle, have been criticized for being unsafe. The doors are operated by a push button from both the outside and inside, systems that can easily fail in an accident. And critics say its emergency release mechanisms are too hidden and impractical. In 2024, three recent high school graduates died after being trapped in a Cybertruck that crashed and caught fire. A bystander at the scene tried to let them free, but couldn’t open the electric doors after the buttons failed.

Shah said that after his incident, he took the vehicle to a Tesla service center, which admitted on an invoice that the rear passenger door was “damaged due to a loose striker.” Tesla offered to buy back the vehicle for nearly its full purchase price, so long as he agreed not to sue the automaker. He took the offer.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Ring’s AI-powered “Search Party” feature, which leverages the company’s network of cameras to find lost dogs, is now available to all Ring customers in the U.S. For the first time, the feature will be made available to those who don’t own a Ring camera, too.

Launched last fall, Search Party uses AI to find possible matches for lost dogs across neighbors’ camera footage.

When a neighbor reports a lost dog in the Ring app, nearby outdoor cameras use AI to scan for possible matches. If a match is found, that camera owner receives an alert and can optionally choose to share any related video clips with their neighbor who reported the pet missing. They’ll also have an option to call the owner or send them a message, without sharing their own phone number.

Ring says the feature has been reuniting more than a dog per day since its launch.

Previously, Search Party was only available to customers with a Ring camera installed. The company is now making Search Party accessible to anyone through the Ring app.

“Now, pet owners can mobilize the whole community—and communities are empowered to help—to find lost pets more effectively than ever before,” noted Ring founder Jamie Siminoff, in an announcement. “That’s why we believe it’s so important to make this feature available to anyone who shares a lost dog post in Neighbors,” he added, referring to the company’s Neighbors app for Ring customers.

Alongside the launch and expansion, Amazon-owned Ring said it’s committing $1 million to equip animal shelters with Ring camera systems, and aims to aid 4,000 U.S. shelters. By adding the shelters to Ring’s network, the company hopes more lost dogs will be reunited with their owners.

The company already works with other nonprofits, including Petco Love and Best Friends Animal Society, and is open to other partnerships.

            <div id="article-text">What is and isn’t a weed that needs to be eliminated in the field is determined by the eyes of the farmer — and now, increasingly, by a new AI model from Carbon Robotics.

Seattle-based Carbon Robotics, which builds the LaserWeeder — a robot fleet that uses lasers to kill weeds — announced a new AI model, the Large Plant Model (LPM), on Monday. This model recognizes plant species instantly and allows farmers to target new weeds without needing to retrain the robots.

The LPM is trained on more than 150 million photos and data points collected by the company’s machines across the more than 100 farms in 15 countries where the robots currently operate. The model now powers Carbon AI, the AI system that serves as the brains inside the company’s autonomous weed-killing robots.

Paul Mikesell, the founder and CEO of Carbon Robotics, told TechCrunch that prior to LPM, every time a new type of weed would show up on a farm — or even the same type of weed in different soil or with a slightly different appearance — the company would have to create new data labels to retrain its machines to recognize the plant.

This process took about 24 hours each time, Mikesell said. Now, LPM can learn a new weed instantly, even if it’s never seen it before.

“The farmer can live in real time and say, ‘Hey, this is a new weed. I want you to kill this,’ and that was something that had never been done before,” Mikesell said. “There’s no new labeling or retraining because the Large Plant Model understands, at a much deeper level, what it’s looking at and the type of plant.”

Mikesell said that the company, which was founded in 2018, started developing this model shortly after it began shipping its first machines in 2022. Mikesell has years of experience building these types of neural networks from previous roles at Uber and working on Meta’s Oculus virtual reality headsets.

This new model will reach the company’s existing systems through a software update. From there, farmers can tell the machine what to kill and what to protect by selecting photos that the machine has collected in the robot’s user interface.

Carbon Robotics has raised more than $185 million in venture capital from backers including Nvidia NVentures, Bond, and Anthos Capital, among others. Now, the company will look to continue to fine-tune the model as the machines continue to feed the LPM new data.

“We have over 150 million labeled plants now in our training set,” Mikesell said. “We have enough data now that we should be able to look at any picture and decide what kind of plant that is, what species it is, what it’s related to, what its structure is like, without having ever even seen that particular plant before, because we have so much data going into the neural net.”

            <p><strong>TechCrunch | 2026-02-02</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/02/coalition-demands-federal-grok-ban-over-nonconsensual-sexual-content/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">A coalition of nonprofits is urging the U.S. government to immediately suspend the deployment of Grok, the chatbot developed by Elon Musk’s xAI, in federal agencies, including the Department of Defense.

The open letter, shared exclusively with TechCrunch, follows a slew of concerning behavior from the large language model over the past year, including most recently a trend of X users asking Grok to turn photos of real women, and in some cases children, into sexualized images without their consent. According to some reports, Grok generated thousands of nonconsensual explicit images every hour, which were then disseminated at scale on X, Musk’s social media platform that’s owned by xAI.

“It is deeply concerning that the federal government would continue to deploy an AI product with system-level failures resulting in generation of nonconsensual sexual imagery and child sexual abuse material,” the letter, signed by advocacy groups like Public Citizen, Center for AI and Digital Policy, and Consumer Federation of America, reads. “Given the administration’s executive orders, guidance, and the recently passed Take It Down Act supported by the White House, it is alarming that [Office of Management and Budget] has not yet directed federal agencies to decommission Grok.”

xAI reached an agreement last September with the General Services Administration (GSA), the government’s purchasing arm, to sell Grok to federal agencies under the executive branch. Two months before, xAI — alongside Anthropic, Google, and OpenAI — secured a contract worth up to $200 million with the Department of Defense.

Amid the scandals on X in mid-January, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said Grok will join Google’s Gemini in operating inside the Pentagon network, handling both classified and unclassified documents, which experts say is a national security risk.

The letter’s authors argue that Grok has proven itself incompatible with the administration’s requirements for AI systems. According to the OMB’s guidance, systems that present severe and foreseeable risks that cannot be adequately mitigated must be discontinued.

“Our primary concern is that Grok has pretty consistently shown to be an unsafe large language model,” JB Branch, a Public Citizen Big Tech accountability advocate and one of the letter’s authors, told TechCrunch. “But there’s also a deep history of Grok having a variety of meltdowns, including antisemitic rants, sexist rants, sexualized images of women and children.”

Several governments have demonstrated an unwillingness to engage with Grok following its behavior in January, which builds on a series of incidents including the generation of antisemitic posts on X and calling itself “MechaHitler.” Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines all blocked access to Grok (they’ve subsequently lifted those bans), and the European Union, the U.K., South Korea, and India are actively investigating xAI and X regarding data privacy and the distribution of illegal content.

The letter also comes a week after Common Sense Media, a nonprofit that reviews media and tech for families, published a damning risk assessment that found Grok is among the most unsafe for kids and teens. One could argue that, based on the findings of the report — including Grok’s propensity to offer unsafe advice, share information about drugs, generate violent and sexual imagery, spew conspiracy theories, and generate biased outputs — Grok isn’t all that safe for adults either.

“If you know that a large language model is or has been declared unsafe by AI safety experts, why in the world would you want that handling the most sensitive data we have?” Branch said. “From a national security standpoint, that just makes absolutely no sense.”

Andrew Christianson, a former National Security Agency contractor and current founder of Gobbi AI, a no-code AI agent platform for classified environments, says that using closed-source LLMs in general is a problem, particularly for the Pentagon.

“Closed weights means you can’t see inside the model, you can’t audit how it makes decisions,” he said. “Closed code means you can’t inspect the software or control where it runs. The Pentagon is going closed on both, which is the worst possible combination for national security.”

“These AI agents aren’t just chatbots,” Christianson added. “They can take actions, access systems, move information around. You need to be able to see exactly what they’re doing and how they’re making decisions. Open source gives you that. Proprietary cloud AI doesn’t.”

The risks of using corrupted or unsafe AI systems spill out beyond national security use cases. Branch pointed out that an LLM that’s been shown to have biased and discriminatory outputs could produce disproportionate negative outcomes for people as well, especially if used in departments involving housing, labor, or justice.

While the OMB has yet to publish its consolidated 2025 federal AI use case inventory, TechCrunch has reviewed the use cases of several agencies — most of which are either not using Grok or are not disclosing their use of Grok. Aside from the DoD, the Department of Health and Human Services also appears to be actively using Grok, mainly for scheduling and managing social media posts and generating first drafts of documents, briefings, or other communication materials.

Branch pointed to what he sees as a philosophical alignment between Grok and the administration as a reason for overlooking the chatbot’s shortcomings.

“Grok’s brand is being the ‘anti-woke large language model,’ and that ascribes to this administration’s philosophy,” Branch said. “If you have an administration that has had multiple issues with folks who’ve been accused of being Neo Nazis or white supremacists, and then they’re using a large language model that has been tied to that type of behavior, I would imagine they might have a propensity to use it.”

This is the coalition’s third letter after writing with similar concerns in August and October last year. In August, xAI launched “spicy mode” in Grok Imagine, triggering mass creation of non-consensual sexually explicit deepfakes. TechCrunch also reported in August that private Grok conversations had been indexed by Google Search.

Prior to the October letter, Grok was accused of providing election misinformation, including false deadlines for ballot changes and political deepfakes. xAI also launched Grokipedia, which researchers found to be legitimizing scientific racism, HIV/AIDS skepticism, and vaccine conspiracies.

Aside from immediately suspending the federal deployment of Grok, the letter demands that the OMB formally investigate Grok’s safety failures and whether the appropriate oversight processes were conducted for the chatbot. It also asks the agency to publicly clarify whether Grok has been evaluated to comply with President Trump’s executive order requiring LLMs to be truth-seeking and neutral and whether it met OMB’s risk mitigation standards.

“The administration needs to take a pause and reassess whether or not Grok meets those thresholds,” Branch said.

            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/02/upscrolleds-founder-says-the-social-network-has-zoomed-past-2-5m-users/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Social network UpScrolled, which gained prominence after TikTok’s ownership change in the U.S. in January, has zoomed past 2.5 million users, the company’s founder Issam Hijazi said during Web Summit Qatar.

“We launched about six months ago, and we grew to about 150,000 up until early January. And as of the last few days, we reached over one million users globally. Now, starting today, we surpassed two-and-a-half million users globally,” Hijazi said.

UpScrolled is a blend of Instagram and X, and claims to be inclusive of all voices. The company says that it allows for all kinds of content and doesn’t shadowban or censor people.

During his speech, Hijazi called out big tech companies for being unethical and selling user data for profit, and accused social networks of suppressing pro-Palestinian content and choosing to censor users selectively.

“They don’t care about selling your data to someone else if that means profit for them. And they don’t care about your mental health, as in they will design something just to keep you addicted to using that platform as long as it’s profitable for them,” he said.

Users on other platforms have complained about UpScrolled hosting a lot of porn and nudity. Hijazi noted that while the company won’t rely on amplification algorithms to boost or suppress certain views, it would have community guidelines in place to comply with laws in different regions. The company is gathering a team of experts to solidify its community guidelines and is also taking user feedback into account, he added.

The company hasn’t announced any funding publicly, but Hijazi said that the social network has been getting investor interest.

In January, TikTok switched to a new ownership structure in the U.S. with a consortium consisting of investors like Silver Lake and Oracle taking a majority share of the company, while ByteDance retained 20% ownership. That change led to many users exploring other social networks. Apart from UpScrolled, AT Protocol-based Skylight also gained attention, crossing 380,000 users in the days following the finalization of the TikTok deal.

While these social networks might have benefited from a short-term boost following organizational changes at TikTok, they will have to build features and a community to retain users. They will also have to form moderation policies and take content decisions that might not be popular with their user base, as Bluesky has discovered over the last few years.

            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/02/linq-raises-20m-to-enable-ai-assistants-to-live-within-messaging-apps/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Sometimes, you might be sitting on a hot product and not know it until the market demands it.

After launching as a digital business card that doubled as a lead capture tool for sales teams, Birmingham, Alabama-based Linq pivoted a few times before landing on an idea last year: helping businesses better communicate with their customers by upgrading from SMS (text) to iMessage and RCS.

Now, Apple already lets businesses do this via its Messages for Business service, and Twilio has built an $18.26 billion business by helping companies text their customers. But users can always tell when they’re talking to a business — the texts are displayed in gray, and the branding is often obvious.

Linq’s customers, though, wanted to be able to send blue-bubble messages to their customers, not green or gray, to lend an air of authenticity to their communications.

The startup, founded by former Shipt executives Elliott Potter (CEO), Patrick Sullivan (CTO), and Jared Mattsson (president), heard that feedback and launched an API in February 2025 that lets companies message their customers natively within iMessage, leveraging all the capabilities Apple’s platform offers to iPhone users, like group chats, emojis, threaded replies, images, and voice notes. Within eight months, Linq had doubled its annual recurring revenue it had built over four years, Potter told TechCrunch.

Linq was not content with its newfound product-market fit, however, as the advent of AI agents gave the company an even larger market to sell its tech to. That idea was sparked by an AI assistant called Poke that can handle tasks, answer questions, and schedule your calendar from inside iMessage was a key catalyst in the company’s refocusing on the agentic market.

“In spring of last year, this company came to us, called the Interaction Company of California, and they were building this AI assistant called poke.com and they were like, ‘Hey, we we don’t have a CRM, but we really want to use your API’,” Potter told TechCrunch.

Poke went viral at launch last September, which, Potter says, led to his team being inundated with requests for tapping their messaging API. All of a sudden, a slew of AI companies wanted to offer their chatbots and assistants directly through iMessage, RCS, and SMS.

Linq now had a decision to make: stick with its original, steady revenue stream from serving B2B clients, or pivot once again to leverage its tech stack and become an infrastructure layer for a new segment of the AI market.

“We still love our sales customers, and we love that use case, but our choices were, do we stay a spoke of this wheel, or do we build the hub? Do we focus on being the infrastructure layer for all these different applications of programmatic messaging?”

Potter thinks that consumers are suffering from app fatigue; but with Linq’s technology, there’s no need to use another app to interact with AI assistants as they can all live within their messaging app. Also, developers won’t have to worry about building an app since they can just build for a messaging-native interface instead.

“Poke.com, along with others, have proved that AI has gotten good enough,” Potter said. “You don’t need a traditional app anymore to do things. Really, you just need an interface that will let you talk to an intelligent enough AI, maybe connect it to some of your systems, and just tell it what to do, and give it feedback.”

Linq ended up pivoting, and it says its customer base has expanded by 132% from the previous quarter, and on average its customer accounts have expanded by 34%. Its customers’ AI agents now reach 134,000 monthly active users via the platform. The company claims it facilitates more than 30 million messages per month, resulting in net revenue retention of 295% with zero churn.

To continue building its tech, the company said on Monday it has raised $20 million in a Series A funding round led by TQ Ventures. Mucker Capital and some angel investors also participated. The company plans to use the fresh cash to expand its team, develop a new go-to-market motion, and continue building its tech. Linq did not disclose its valuation.

Rosy outlook aside, the reality is that Linq is still building on top of Apple’s platform — at least for now. There’s no telling if Apple will pull a Meta and bar third parties from offering AI chatbots on its platform. Besides, iMessage is popular in the U.S., but the rest of the world also uses other messaging services like WhatsApp, WeChat, Telegram, and Signal.

Potter, however, says Linq’s eventual goal lies beyond messaging. “Our vision for the platform is everything you need to build conversational tech, and that’s not limited to a few channels. Right now, we have programmatic voice, we have iMessage, RCS, SMS. That’s just the beginning. Our ambition is, wherever your customers are, you should be able to talk to them, be it Slack, be it email, be it Telegram, WhatsApp, Discord, Signal, anywhere your customers are, and can converse.”

“By making AI-to-human communication as frictionless as texting a friend, Linq is enabling an entirely new category of companies,” Andrew Marks, co-founding partner of TQ Ventures, said in a statement. “Linq’s founding team is extraordinary, and we have no doubt in their ability to execute on this massive opportunity.”

            <div id="article-text">Digital meeting notetakers like Read AI, Fireflies.ai, Fathom, and Granola help record and transcribe online meetings. But for in-person or more versatile options, many people prefer physical recording devices These physical notetakers transcribe audio and give users summaries and action items of meetings using AI.

Some of these devices are wearable—pins or pendants with dedicated mics for recording—while others are credit-card sized with dedicated mobile apps to transcribe and extract insights using AI. A few even offer live translation.

Below is a non-exhaustive list of physical AI notetakers and transcription tools.

This credit card-sized notetaker has been around since 2023, with a newer, AI-powered Pro version that has a small screen, four mics, and records audio within three to five meters. It also can switch between in-person recording and call recording.

The Plaud Note costs $159, while the Note Pro costs $179. They come with 300 minutes of transcription free per month.

Mobvi’s rectangular notetaker is priced at $159 and includes 600 free transcription minutes. The company claims the device shows real-time transcription and translation with support for more than 120 languages. The device offers 25 hours of continuous recording through its three microphones.

In terms of software features, the TicNote offers automatic highlight extraction and the ability to create audio clips or summarized podcast versions of a conversation.

Comulytic is a newer entrant in the hardware AI notetaker market. The company’s claim for differentiation is that its $159 Note Pro device doesn’t require any additional subscription for basic transcription. That means you can transcribe unlimited minutes by just buying the device.

The device can record up to 45 hours of audio continuously on a single charge and has more than 100 days of standby time.

The company has a $15 per month or $119 per year advanced plan that offers instant AI summaries, unlimited templates for summaries, an action item list, and chat with AI assistant without any limits.

Plaud NotePin and NotePin S are the smaller and more pocketable versions of the company’s larger Note and Note Pro devices. The NotePin has a versatile design: You can wear it as a wrist band, a pendant, clip it to your bag, or wear it on your shirt with a magnetic attachment. Notably, the lanyard and wristband are only available with the NotePin S.

Both devices have two mics, and can record around 20 hours of audio continuously on a single charge. The NotePin S has a physical button to start/stop recording and capture highlights.

Both are similarly priced to their credit-card-shaped counterparts. The NotePin is priced at $159, and the NotePin S is priced at $179.

The Omi pendant is a cheaper alternative to other notetakers at $89. This is because the pendant has to be connected to your phone and doesn’t have any onboard memory. The device has two mics and can run for 10 to 14 hours on a charge.

While Omi has its own app, you can use other apps as the hardware and software are open-sourced. Users have also built different connectors and apps for the device.

Viaim’s earbuds allow for transcription during calls, with additional recording capabilities in the earbuds’ case. These buds are priced at $200 and Viaim claims they can transcribe audio in up to 78 languages in real-time. The company’s app can also highlight key points in transcriptions.

Anker’s Soundcore Work pin is a coin-sized AI notetaker with a puck-shaped battery pack. The $159 device can record for eight hours without breaks, or up to 32 hours if the pin is attached to its case, the company says.

Anker claims that the device has a five-meter recording range. Users get 300 minutes of transcription free per month.

            <h2>A Social-Media Ban Really Could Do a Lot of Good</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-02-02</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/2026/02/australia-social-media-ban-effects/685853/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Australia recently decided to try something ambitious. Starting late last year, all children under 16 have been banned from having accounts on social-media sites such as TikTok, YouTube, and Instagram. Because no country has attempted such a ban before, knowing the effects in advance is impossible—and they may be hard to assess even years after implementation.

That said, the long experience of governments trying to restrict young people’s access to temptation goods of other kinds—drugs, alcohol, cigarettes, pornography—justifies cautious optimism. The ban might deliver some truly valuable benefits, letting youthful missteps remain local and ephemeral, rather than searing permanent brands onto developing psyches, and giving young people more time to develop the in-person social skills and connections that make life meaningful.

Before we dive into details, we must address two reflexive, skeptical views of social-media bans. The first is that no matter how cleverly designed or strict a ban is, some kids will figure out ways around it, and thus the ban serves no purpose. By that logic, countries should abandon bans on robbery, toxic dumping, and corporate malfeasance, none of which is ever 100 percent foolproof. Already some Australian teens may have downloaded VPN software to get around the ban—but perfectionism should not be the enemy of progress.

Listen: Is this the end of kids on social media?

The second mistake is to think that all prohibitions look like the much-maligned War on Drugs, which many view as responsible for exacerbating incarceration, poverty, and violence. A social-media ban is not like the War on Drugs. Governments ban all sorts of goods and services for youth, adults, or both, and most prohibitions do not create other devastating social problems. Violations of the Australian ban would lead to fines on corporations, not kids being sent to detention centers.

But the core lesson from other bans is that most of them produce the intended effects, reducing the activity they seek to stem. For example, fireworks-related injuries tended to be much lower in states whose fireworks laws were more restrictive, but later rose in the many states that relaxed their laws in the late 20th and early 21st centuries. Perhaps the most revealing analogues are the widespread age restrictions for the purchase and consumption of tobacco, alcohol, and cannabis, which are common around the world and have been extensively studied.

Yes, compliance will be imperfect. Data from the CDC show that in the past month, 4 percent of high-school students smoked a cigarette, 17 percent used marijuana, 17 percent vaped, and 22 percent drank alcohol, despite being underage. Thanks to older siblings and friends, permissive parents, fake IDs, and unethical sellers, some young people have always found ways to evade these bans, and similar tactics could work for surmounting a social-media ban as well. Yet all of these behaviors are still far more prevalent among adults, and there is a marked increase in uptake right as young people cross the legal threshold, an indication of the bans’ real impact.

Other studies suggest that even partially effective bans can reduce underage substance use and lead to other positive outcomes. Researchers exploited the staggered rollout of new state laws that increased the drinking age from 18 to 21 over the course of the 1980s to determine that although many people ages 18 to 20 evaded the ban, raising the legal age for drinking reduced alcohol consumption and traffic crashes among that group. A subsequent review was even more decisive, pronouncing the debate over the ban’s effects “closed.” Similar policies raised the minimum legal age for purchasing tobacco to 21 in the late 2010s, and had similar effects.

Adolescence is a time of high neuroplasticity in which many lifelong habits, good and bad, are formed. This is why companies pay a premium to advertise their products on TV shows that attract young viewers, and it is also why social-media companies see Australia’s ban as a long-term economic threat. People are generally far less likely to become addicted to something if they are introduced to it after their brain is fully developed (at about age 25), and every year of adolescence that someone delays using an addictive product, their risk of developing problems with it drops. Researchers have shown that growing up in a state and time after the drinking age was raised predicted decreased binge-drinking episodes in a sample of men as old as 53.

Positive outcomes from raising the minimum legal age for addictive substances do not guarantee success for imposing minimum legal ages on social-media accounts. Consuming alcohol, tobacco, or cannabis requires the acquisition of a physical object. This creates regulatory checkpoints (for instance, mandatory ID checks) that are hard to replicate online. Parents, teachers, and other adults who work with young people may have an easier time detecting these substances (smelling smoke; noticing that someone is drunk) than detecting whether someone is illegally using Instagram.

However, in other respects, banning access to social media may be easier. Many teens appear to want to be off social media; they see it as detrimental to their own well-being but nevertheless feel they have to be on it to keep up with their peers. Fascinating economic research has shown that many social-media users would pay money to avoid a break from social media while others continue using it, but many of those same users would pay money to have the entire network deactivated for everyone.

Elias Wachtel: Can Gen Z get rid of its iPhones?

A ban might solve this collective-action problem, just as banning steroids in sporting competitions spares athletes from feeling compelled to damage their bodies just to keep up with competitors who dope. Young people can look at pornography alone (and presumably would generally prefer to), but social media is a lot less enticing if people you know are banned from using it. A ban thus can make using social media less rewarding in a way that is not true of pornography: As your peers reduce or stop their use, your incentive to do the same increases, in a mutually reinforcing cycle.

A final significant question is whether the ban is politically sustainable. Cannabis prohibition was the law of the land in America until it wasn’t, brought down by an unusual combination of deep-pocketed corporate interests and left-leaning anti-corporate people who objected to punishing users (especially disadvantaged groups) for violating the ban. The social-media ban already has corporate opponents, including some of the world’s most influential companies. But because the ban penalizes corporations, not consumers who break the rules, ban-repeal advocates may have a harder time drawing a coalition of cross-partisan support.

Policies are rarely purely good, and the ban is likely to result in trade-offs. A few years from now, we may learn, for example, that rural Australian youth report feeling more isolated, but reading scores in junior high are rising nationally. Or we may find that participation in youth sports grows but so does compulsive computer gaming. Australia’s voters will have to assess what trade-offs they find reasonable. Regardless of how they choose, they will have done other countries a service by being the first mover as the world contends with how to live with such powerful new technologies.</div>

            <div id="article-text">Every student of modern art knows how European and American avant-gardists of the early 20th century had their world rocked by Indigenous art—how they swooned over and strove to imitate the dynamic concision they saw in ethnographic exhibitions. How Picasso launched Cubism by sticking African masks on French prostitutes in Les Demoiselles d’Avignon. How Marsden Hartley paved his way to abstraction with tepees and Native American symbols. How Jackson Pollock started painting on the floor after seeing a demonstration of Navajo sand painters at the Museum of Modern Art in 1941.

Generally overlooked in Art History 101 was the inverse: how European materials and images were repurposed by Indigenous artists. That 1941 MoMA show was full of ancient Native objects, along with recent work that adhered closely to historic examples. (The catalog advised readers that “Good Indian work, done without the interference of whites, includes restrained colors as well as bright ones, and usually leans to economy rather than complexity of design.”) As with MoMA’s earlier shows of African and folk art, American Indian art merited inclusion in a museum of modernism not because it was modern, but because it offered inspiration to a Euro-American avant-garde. Somehow, modernist aping of Indigenous models got told as a story of increasing originality, while Indigenous adaptation of Western models was seen in terms of decreasing authenticity. The logic was clear enough: The proper job of Western art was forever to point to the future; that of Indigenous art was forever to repeat the past.

It has taken a century for the art world to realize its mistake, but contemporary Indigenous art is now having a moment. Major museums are mounting exhibitions of recent Aboriginal art from Australia and Native art from the Americas. In the imposing nine-pound book Toi Te Mana: An Indigenous History of Māori Art, the art historian Ngarino Ellis writes enthusiastically of a new “global Indigenous art world.” Its advent was clear at the 2024 Venice Biennale, which featured Māori artists from New Zealand, Kaqchikel artists from Guatemala, and Nonuya artists from Colombia. The Australian pavilion’s award-winning installation interwove personal genealogy with 65,000 years of Aboriginal history. The Brazilian pavilion was renamed the Hãhãwpuá pavilion by Tupinambá artists, and the Danish pavilion was relabeled Kalaallit Nunaat (the Greenlandic name for Greenland) by the photographer Inuuteq Storch. The U.S. pavilion kept its name, but its mini-Monticello exterior was swathed from pavement to cornice in the eye-popping geometries of the Choctaw/Cherokee artist Jeffrey Gibson, the first Native American to fill the building with a solo exhibition.

Gibson, whose statues of anthropomorphized animals in Native regalia are currently holding court on the facade of the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City, is one of the world’s most visible artists. A MacArthur fellow, admired by critics and popular with the art-going public, he has used his platform to normalize the idea of “an Indigenous present.” The phrase, designed to disrupt the equation of Indigenous with cultural stasis, forms the title for both his compendium of contemporary Native art, published in 2023, and a new traveling exhibition of Native abstraction that opened at the Institute of Contemporary Art in Boston last fall, before heading to the Frist Museum in Nashville and the Frye Museum in Seattle.

Rambunctious and enticing, the book consists of 450 pages packed with images of works by 60 artists—running the gamut from sassy conceptualism to enigmatic video stills, and from the lyrical painting of Jaune Quick-to-See Smith to Wendy Red Star’s photographic self-portrait as a diorama Indian with an inflatable elk. There is no obvious chronological or typological order to the presentation, nor any of the usual scholarly overviews. The title page doesn’t arrive until page 35.

The “Indigenous Present” exhibition, by contrast, feels almost stately—six dozen works by 15 artists, gracefully laid out in spacious galleries. Given the rubric of abstraction, the Indigenous references don’t jump out the way they do in Red Star’s photograph, but they make themselves felt through what the Cree artist Kimowan Metchewais called “live relics”—attributes of a culture that run beneath the surface, animating everything.

The oldest and oddest works in the show are the “personality prints” (actually triptych drawings) by Mary Sully, who was born in 1896 and died in 1963. Made in the decades before World War II, they depict their subjects in riddle-like sequences that progress from streamlined emblems to decorative patterns. The one dedicated to the aviator Beryl Markham, for example, begins with a cusp of blue water bookended by a pair of coastlines and matching female silhouettes—a tidy graphic summa of Markham’s record-breaking 1936 Atlantic crossing. Below it, a second drawing adapts those elements into a moiré pattern, suggesting both pistons and waves; the third drawing crystallizes the theme with interlocking polygons. Precisely delineated with colored pencil, Sully’s pictures look simultaneously naive and urbanely sophisticated. They echo flapper-era print ads and Art Deco posters and fabric design, as well as the kind of modernist abstract painting she would have encountered while living in New York City, along with the Dakota quillwork she would have learned as a child on the Standing Rock Reservation in South Dakota.

Sully, whose real name was Susan Deloria, was both the great-granddaughter of the English-born painter Thomas Sully (it’s his portrait of Andrew Jackson that glowers at us from $20 bills) and the great-aunt of the Harvard historian Philip Deloria, whose 2019 book, Becoming Mary Sully, first brought her to public attention. A reserved and seemingly fragile person—Deloria calls her “an Indian soulmate to Emily Dickinson”—she never exhibited her work, and we have no idea what her aims were. Her subjects were an eclectic bunch: Bob Ripley (he of “Believe It or Not”), Gertrude Stein (who got rows of roses), the polar explorer Admiral Byrd. It’s hard to cast them all in the same play, maybe because they interested her less as people than as prompts. What seems to have motivated, even delighted, her was not representation but transformation—the transition from real life to geometry, from the anecdotal to the eternal.

Unseen for most of a century, Sully’s drawings can hardly be called influential, but in their multipart format, physical modesty, and casual interlacing of pop culture and Native references, they anticipate much of the show’s later work. The hefty paper sheets of Metchewais’s Luther (Striped Man) (2003) climb the wall with the erratic logic of a Post-it brainstorming session. Creased here and there from previous folding, they are stained rust red and nicotine yellow, and several carry the photographic image of a standing figure shrouded in black-and-white-striped fabric. It has the playfulness of a sheet ghost, Op Art style, while recalling old photographs of Native leaders wrapped in chiefs’ blankets. Taped together on the front rather than the back, Metchewais’s constructions—he called them “paper walls”—wear their contingency on the surface, keeping open the possibility of other potential arrangements, other ways of connecting.

Almost everybody here has been to art school. Walking through the galleries, you can draw connections to Pop Art or Conceptualism or Bay Area Funk and not be wrong. One room features the familiar minimalist format of near-identical objects arranged in grids, where the viewer’s task is to recognize the conceptual rule underlying their slight differences. Each of the 27 paintings from Kay WalkingStick’s Chief Joseph Series (1974–76) carries four sliced-arc shapes in various arrangements, but the title directs attention not to abstract concepts but to a real person: the Nez Percé leader who guided his followers on a 1,000-mile trek in pursuit of self-determination. Suddenly those sliced arcs begin to look like strung bows, and her muted palette begins to feel like an elegy. Similarly, the angular shapes that repeat across Dakota Mace’s 80 chemigrams (created by painting photo developer and other materials onto light-sensitive paper) are Diné symbols, linking land and lore.

For an exhibition of serious contemporary art, “An Indigenous Present” feels uncommonly light on its feet. These gridded installations lay claim to a lot of real estate, but the objects they are built from could fit in a backpack. Sully’s oeuvre spent decades in a suitcase. Untaped and folded, Metchewais’s “walls” could be carried under an arm. Such rejections of monumentality are not rare in contemporary art, but they usually appear as a reaction against what came before—a swerve away from the bombast of Expressionism, the hard shells of Minimalism, the slickness of Pop. What you see in “An Indigenous Present,” however, feels less like refutation than a willing handshake with the past—but it’s a different past.

Indigeneity is by definition site-specific—a statement of cultural continuity between a particular place and its people for time out of mind. Discussions of a “global Indigenous art world” thus raise the question of what a Choctaw/Cherokee MacArthur fellow working in the Hudson Valley and an illiterate Anmatyerr woman working in Australia’s Central Desert might have in common. The obvious answer is a shared legacy of colonial dispossession, racism, and cultural condescension, and plenty of Indigenous art calls out injustice in explicit terms.

But that’s not the central focus of “An Indigenous Present,” nor of the expansive survey “The Stars We Do Not See: Australian Indigenous Art,” organized by the National Gallery of Victoria, which opened its North American tour at the National Gallery in Washington, D.C., in November. And it was nowhere to be seen in the retrospective that Tate Modern in London recently devoted to the groundbreaking Aboriginal painter Emily Kam Kngwarray.

Kngwarray was a phenomenon. Born sometime between 1910 and 1914, she grew up foraging, hunting, and sleeping in grass shelters. She remembered her first sight of a “whitefeller.” (She ran away.) She spoke little English and learned to write her signature only when it was time to endorse her pension checks. For most of her life, her artistic gifts were exercised in body painting and drawing in the sand—crucial elements of the ceremonies through which Aboriginal culture has been maintained down the millennia. But in 1977, Utopia Station, the tiny settlement where she had learned to write her name, began classes in batik, the Indonesian process of using hot wax on fabric as a dye-resist, with the goal of helping Aboriginal women earn money through handicrafts. (Funding agencies doubted the capacity of Aboriginal women for such fine work. They needn’t have worried, as the luminous silks teeming with squiggles, dots, and flattened lizards at Tate Modern showed.) Kngwarray was in her late 70s when she began working with acrylic, and in her final eight years, she produced thousands of paintings, some the size of a school bus. Video footage shows her dabbing paint insistently on canvases laid out on the ground. As the global audience for Aboriginal art grew, she emerged as a star. A year after her death, Kngwarray’s work was in the 1997 Venice Biennale. Today it can be seen cladding a Qantas 787 Dreamliner in giant red webs and white spots.

For non-Australian viewers, the Tate show was a revelation. Juddering across her 1991 painting Kam, spots of color—yellow, white, ochre—cluster and disperse amid darkness. The canvas is nearly 10 feet long and 4.5 feet tall but feels bigger, as if it stretched not just side to side and up and down but also back in space and even time. It is a knock-your-socks-off painting, engrossing and peculiar. The only visual analogues that spring to mind for its inchoate choreography are Hubble Space Telescope images of cosmic clouds and nascent nebulae, unimaginably distant and impossibly large. Read the label, though, and you find the picture rooted to the ground: In Kngwarray’s native Anmatyerr language, kam is the name for the tiny seeds and seedpods of the pencil yam for which she was named, a vital resource for Aboriginal people in Australia’s Central Desert. Limitless space collapses into something small, local, and edible.

“The Stars We Do Not See” includes photography, video, and conceptual art, but what makes it astonishing is the breadth of painting produced by Aboriginal artists over the past 50 years. After centuries of images that were either ephemeral (body painting; drawing in loose earth) or immovable (rock art), numerous Aboriginal groups in the 1970s and ’80s began making things that white audiences could recognize as art. In Arnhem Land in the Northern Territory, artists expanded the practice of bark painting, using hand-ground ochre to portray loose-jointed human figures. In the Western Desert settlement of Papunya, they worked with industrially made boards and paints to create pictures in which arrays of dots nestle and collide. In Utopia Station, they started with batik. Most compositions run edge-to-edge with interwoven lines, wavering zigzags, or fields of dots dancing over and under other shapes. There are no horizons, no evidence for up or down. Why would there be in imagery that arose from the practice of drawing on the ground?

In the context of Tate Modern or the National Gallery’s East Building, it is tempting to see echoes of Western postwar abstraction—early Philip Guston, late Larry Poons, Brice Marden in his tangled-line phase—but those references would have been as alien to Kngwarray or Papunya artists as the experience of foraging for yams is to most of us. Whatever we may think we are seeing, they were not painting “abstractions”; they were painting “Country.”

That word, capitalized, appears 212 times in the Kngwarray catalog and 189 times in “The Stars We Do Not See” catalog, but its meaning remains elusive. It can refer to the native territory of a people, or more broadly to “the lands, salt and fresh waters, the subterranean and the cosmos to which they are connected,” the curator Kimberley Moulton writes. Inseparable from the ancestral stories called Dreamings, it also encompasses “law, place, custom, languages, spiritual belief, cultural practice, family and identity.” With such an extensive crib sheet, all kinds of things can be read into these images—cracked earth, reflected light on water, night skies, ecological awareness, metaphysics.

The enormous painting that greets visitors to the National Gallery show, Ngayartu Kujarra (2009), is mostly occupied by a single white shape, wobbly at the edges, some 13 feet long and seven feet high. Around the white, patches of variegated color swell and thin in the way littoral landscapes do—a scrubby green bit here, a sandy pink bit there, a shoal-like shape pushing up into the whiteness. The intimation of topography is confirmed by the label: Ngayartu Kujarra is the Punmu name for a seasonal salt lake also known as Lake Dora. The large blue dots that appear at the edge of the composition are sacred watering holes in the surrounding desert.

The canvas—a collaborative project by 12 Punmu women—was painted over the course of a week on-site, outdoors, in 118-degree heat. Led by a “senior custodian” of Punmu culture, the women sang, then walked onto the canvas to paint. When they finished, they laid the canvas on the lake’s crusted-salt surface, where it was celebrated with further song and dance. Finally, the National Gallery of Victoria reports, it was taken inside, and a last white coat was added “because it was too dirty from all of the dogs and cups of tea and little kids touching it.”

The curators are keen to educate visitors about Aboriginal life and worldviews. Wall panels offer primers on the central role of Country and Dreamings. Photographs show landscapes whose patchy growth patterns reverberate through the paintings. Videos let us hear the languages being spoken. But there are limits to what is being shared, we are informed. In Aboriginal societies, access to certain knowledge, designs, and even pigments may be restricted by age, gender, genealogy, or status within the community. Some of this is negotiable (initially the painters were all men), but much is not.

Maintaining these constraints in a world of oral transmission is one thing, but paintings can be carried anywhere and seen by anyone. While many artists saw painting as a way of keeping their culture alive for younger generations who may or may not live in their historic Country, traditionalists worried about how geographic or spiritual information appeared and what outside audiences were told.

All of this required invention. One reason for all of those dots, scholars have suggested, might be that they act a bit like pebble glass in a bathroom, diffusing without denying that which should not be shared. In addition to finding pictorial solutions to the problems of protected knowledge, Aboriginal artists needed to create a new language to translate the social, performative, and transient experience of ceremonies into the step-back, stand-still experience of a picture hung on a wall. Like artists everywhere, they were navigating between inherited cultures and present-day opportunities. The Yolngu artist Nonggirrnga Marawili painted on tubes made of rolled bark, a form that imitates the hollow logs once used by the Yolngu as ossuaries. Her grid designs refer both to a network of water holes and to the fish traps of ancestral hunters, but their magenta hues come from recycled toner cartridges. The 12 Punmu women were inspired to make their painting of Lake Dora after seeing it from a plane.

It would be foolish to make broad statements about Indigenous art on the basis of three exhibitions. But one thing that seemed distinctive—a contrast to the general tenor of contemporary art on other floors in the same buildings—was the solicitousness with which the artists approached their cultural inheritance. Western art likes to move forward by rebelling against its parents. Never mind that it does so through old-fashioned means, such as oil on canvas and cast metal: The rhetoric is one of rupture. In these shows, the rhetoric is different—neither rejection nor blind adherence to tradition, but simply respect, and an affirmation of a vital and lasting universe.

One of the mesmerizing works in “An Indigenous Present” is Audie Murray’s video installation Bear Smudge (2022). For most of its 30-minute run time, all you see is a field of flickering pastels, like a glitchy, pixelated Monet landscape. You can hear wind, shuffling footsteps, and what sounds like the striking of a match. Sometimes a distinctive motion within the static hints at the presence of a person. The wall text explains that you’re watching the artist perform a ceremony after smearing bear grease on the camera lens. What exactly she is doing on the other side of that bear grease is not explained, though anyone who has binge-watched Reservation Dogs or Resident Alien may recognize the practice of wafting cleansing smoke, and it’s easy enough to look up Native American smudging rituals on your phone. Objects spread out on the gallery floor offer clues, but the game of deduction is far less engaging than the scintillating field on the wall.

The visual effect is oddly reminiscent of Kngwarray’s Kam. Both convey a sense of particles in motion and of events taking place below the surface—some organizing engine hovering just out of view. The video and the painting were made in different centuries on opposite ends of the Earth, but they walk the same delicate line between making something visible and making it clear. Both artists were creating work that they knew would be seen by viewers unversed in their traditions and perhaps unmoored from the very idea of reverence.

Talking about his “Indigenous Present” exhibition, Jeffrey Gibson posed a set of questions rare in the usual run of contemporary art: “What is meant to be seen? How do you protect something? How do you transform something so you can share it, but not reveal it?” Most spiritual traditions—Indigenous and otherwise—restrict access to the sacred. But even beyond religious mystery, it can be salutary to be reminded of the existence of things beyond your ken. The title of “The Stars We Do Not See” was inspired by the Yolngu concept of “the stars behind the stars”—everything that exists yet escapes perception.

“It turns out,” Metchewais wrote in a 2009 Facebook post, “the thing in the modern world that most matches the Indian psyche is the web.” This might seem a reach, but as the technology historian James Gleick pointed out in a recent essay, Tim Berners-Lee’s crucial insight in creating the web was that “what matters is not objects but relationships.” The observation made me think of the 12 women working together on the huge salt-lake painting, and of Sully’s drawings, where what happens between each section feels more meaningful than what happens within any given one. In the “Indigenous Present” book, the curator Candice Hopkins argues that modernists missed the point by adopting the look of Indigenous objects while doing “away with any social role of that cultural belonging.” It occurred to me that if you relocate Gibson’s question about how to share and yet protect something, you have the essential conundrum of the internet age.

The art world is a fickle place. Inevitably the buzz around Indigenous art will fade away. The art itself, however, is likely to remain—not because of any high-minded notion of equal representation in institutional settings, or even for the window it opens onto worlds we may not know, but because of the light it shines on the one we’re all in.

            <h2>A <em>Survivor</em> Contestant’s Empathetic Reality TV Novel</h2>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">There’s a saying on Survivor: “Perception is reality.” There’s a saying on TikTok: “Do it for the plot.”

Both maxims are about the stories people tell themselves. The first acknowledges that someone’s read of a situation will shape the outcome—even if they’re reading things wrong. The second declares that all of life is a story and you need to provide the drama.

The desire to treat life as a narrative—and then control that narrative—is the subject of Stephen Fishbach’s debut novel, Escape!, a literary thriller that follows a single season of a fictional reality survival show from casting to airtime. Fishbach writes from experience: He was a two-time contestant on Survivor and co-hosts a Survivor podcast. To inform his book, he interviewed many other reality contestants and crew members. The result marries the plot twists of a competition show with compassionate portraits of the people involved who are searching for identity and meaning. It’s both an examination of how the reality-TV sausage gets made and a reminder that people can sacrifice their humanity if they focus too much on making the plot—of a television program, of life itself—exciting.

Escape! joins many other stories inspired by reality television. The Lifetime show UnREAL, which was co-created by a former Bachelor producer, similarly offered an insider’s view of the underbelly of reality-TV production. Books such as Suzanne Collins’s The Hunger Games and Nana Kwame Adjei-Brenyah’s Chain-Gang All-Stars use reality TV as scaffolding for dystopias in which entertainment is used to numb a populace to injustice. Aisling Rawle’s 2025 book The Compound features a Big Brother–meets–dating show setup as a way to explore how materialist greed can impede connection. The drama alone of reality TV makes it a compelling subject for fiction. But the genre feels particularly relevant today, more than 25 years after the first season of Survivor aired, when anyone with a social-media account can perform a version of themselves on a small screen. Every Instagram or TikTok post presents questions of how to edit a life.

Fishbach’s novel stands out because it explores the complicated dynamics of self-narrativizing—and because it’s enriched by the behind-the-scenes details informed by his firsthand experience. The show in Escape! is not Survivor, but it rhymes: Both have an island-jungle setting, outdoor-obstacle-course competitions, alliances, and backstabbing. Both administer a personality test during casting and keep players’ medications in a box in the jungle out of sight of cameras. Contestants can tell when their fellow players are plotting, Fishbach writes, because the crew moves the boom mic closer to them. (Fishbach writes in an author’s note that though many plot points are inspired by true events, “nothing in this book should be taken to impugn” the staff of Survivor. And Survivor exists in the world of the novel, as if to emphasize that Fishbach isn’t really describing the show he was once on.) He’s a funny observer of some of the genre’s more ridiculous tropes. When the contestants compete for a food reward, he writes that they “rub their stomachs and pull O-faces at the idea of these soggy pastries, mirroring the reaction shots they’ve seen from other contestants on previous shows.” Although a couple of the producer characters veer into cartoonish villainy, for the most part Fishbach manages to critique reality TV while maintaining empathy for those who make it.

Driving the novel is each character’s relentless pursuit of a story arc that they hope will redeem, transform, or elevate them. All of Fishbach’s characters—Miriam, the timid young contestant who hopes the show will give her a life-changing revelation; Kent, the has-been reality star looking to recapture his former glory; Beck, the disgraced producer projecting her issues onto the cast; and a collection of other reality-show archetypes who populate the background—are laser-focused on The Edit. (The Edit is “shorthand for the story that a TV show tells about a character,” as Beck explains. “Our job is to simplify and clarify.”)

Fishbach surely knows a thing or two about how the narrative structure of reality TV flattens people. In his first appearance, on Survivor: Tocantins, he has said he was portrayed as “more heroic than I am,” while in his second season, Survivor: Cambodia, he was sometimes played for laughs. “During its airing, I felt a lot of shame every week wondering which of my moments would be edited for maximum comic effect,” he told Entertainment Weekly. In Escape!, Fishbach portrays The Edit as, at best, a necessary evil, and, at worst, a life-ruining malevolence. The players obsess over how the show will digest their actions, what kind of narrative it will spit out. Will they get a Loser Edit or a Hero Edit? When Kent approaches the island for the first time, for example, he is “already thinking about how he’ll describe it in his interviews.” The producers manipulate the players into embodying the characters they preordained during casting and pat themselves on the back for constructing such a good story. Beck is not above using a woman’s dead son to make her emotional enough to quit, or browbeating Miriam into killing a pig for the sake of her “growth arc.” Compelled to redo a shark hunt that the cameras missed the first time, one contestant gets seriously injured.

Even as the producers’ manipulations turn dangerous, Escape! is clear that the contestants are complicit co-creators of their simplified selves. Kent, Fishbach writes, is “not here for the cash, or the plotting and scheming, or the banter. He’s here to slip into the old costume, which has started to sag and tear. He’s here to be Kent Duvall.” The heroic character he was edited into during his first season feels more real to him than the miserable person he is in his actual life. He’s trying to return to a self that only ever existed on a screen. Miriam goes along with Beck’s heavy-handed suggestions that she, not Kent, should be the hero, in part because she thinks the show might transform her into a new, somehow truer version of herself.

Although most readers of Escape! will never find themselves competing on TV, the characters’ concerns are relatable. Humans can’t help but see life as a narrative. An innate part of our psychology is arranging memories, experiences, and desires into a coherent story. Psychologists say that these stories form our personalities, our very selves. Reality TV preys on this natural impulse and can warp it to dehumanizing extremes.

Fishbach captures how reality TV takes the internal process of turning your life into a story, and makes it external. Who hasn’t replayed a moment in their mind, imagining what they could have done differently, what they should have said? The contestants on Escape! really do relive the same moment over and over with slight variations, as the camera operators insist on take after take. They get feedback from producers in real time on whether they’re living up to the role they’re supposed to play. It’s intoxicating: “On the show, every morsel of food he ate, how long he slept, every passing whim or frustration, mattered urgently to the producers,” Kent thinks. “It was how life should be, all the purposefulness of a religion, that the trivial opinions and feuds of your tiny existence mattered in the eyes of God.”

Reality television isn’t the only place where people can elevate their tiny existence into a grand narrative. Social media has long encouraged users to present their lives as easily legible stories—a mindset that seems to have intensified in recent years. During the height of the pandemic, posters diagnosed themselves and others with “main-character syndrome,” which, depending on whom you ask, is either a form of extreme narcissism or a way of empowering yourself by pretending you’re the star of a movie. The internet serves up a buffet of character types that people can strive to become or avoid becoming: clean girl, tradwife, Pilates princess, performative male, Chad. And if you’re wondering if you should do something ill-advised, such as text your ex, posters may cheekily encourage you to “do it for the plot.”

The sheer volume of stories people are exposed to in modern life can drown out the ability to hear one’s own true voice. At one point in Escape!, Beck wonders whether her work of unearthing contestants’ stories has any meaning, when so many meanings are imposed on everyone from the outside: “Maybe the very idea of depths, of an ‘authentic self,’ was merely another story, buried under layers of stories,” Fishbach writes. “We were all palimpsests of platitudes.”

Yet the book doesn’t give in to that despair. Toward the end of the novel, Kent remembers a touching moment with fellow contestants from his first TV appearance. He realizes he forgot it for years because it didn’t make the show’s final cut. When you edit down the mess of life, something is always deleted. But perhaps, Fishbach suggests, it’s not lost forever.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">At some point over the past 15 years, kids stopped reading. Or at least their teachers stopped asking them to read the way they once did. We live in the age of the reel, the story, the sample, the clip. The age of the excerpt. And even in old-fashioned literature classes, assignments have been abbreviated so dramatically that high-school English teachers are, according to one recent survey, assigning fewer than three books a year.

I’ve seen the effects of this change up close, having taught English in college classrooms since 2007, and I’ve witnessed the slow erosion of attention firsthand, too: students on computers in the back of lecture halls, then on phones throughout the classroom, then outsourcing their education to artificial intelligence. We know that tech companies supply the means of distraction. But somehow the blame falls on the young reader. Whole novels aren’t possible to teach, we are told, because students won’t (or can’t) read them. So why assign them?

When I walked into my American-literature class at Case Western Reserve University last fall, I looked at 32 college students, mostly science majors, and expected an uphill battle. As my colleague Rose Horowitch has reported, “Many students no longer arrive at college—even at highly selective, elite colleges—prepared to read books.” One-third of the high-school seniors tested in 2024 were found not to have basic reading skills.

Yet by the end of the semester, as we read the last sentence of Toni Morrison’s Song of Solomon, I regretted ever doubting my students. I am now convinced that I was wrong to listen to the ostensible wisdom of the day—and that teachers of literature are wrong to give up assigning the books we loved ourselves. There may be plenty of good reasons to despair over the present. The literature classroom should not be one of them.

The image of a college literature class hasn’t changed much in the past 50 years. A group of students are sitting around a table, or maybe they’re perched in a lecture hall, looking down at a passage by Melville, reading a sentence out loud, puzzling over a metaphor, feeling the jolt of possibility that comes when their world is reimagined in startling language. My most vivid memory of reading an entire novel in college was picking up Virginia Woolf’s To the Lighthouse. On an unseasonably warm spring night in 2002, I propped myself against the steps of the library, opened the book, and stayed there until the early morning.

I’ve taught for nearly two decades, but last fall I was worried in a way I’d never been before. I’ve always assigned long, challenging books. I regularly teach To the Lighthouse to first-year students, sometimes swapping it out for James Joyce’s Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man or Mulk Raj Anand’s Untouchable. But anecdotes and statistics about the decline of reading unsettled me. Plus, I was worried about my own raddled attention span, and I was unnerved by the apparent inevitability of AI-generated essays.

My course, a survey of American literature from 1660 to the present, felt like a dare: 400 years of literature in a single semester. And yet my fears that students might refuse to read helped clarify my approach. Instead of hopscotching from one excerpt to the next, I’d create small eddies in time. We’d spend several days, sometimes a couple of weeks, on a single author. We’d read nonfiction and novels—Harriet Jacobs’s Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl, Faulkner’s As I Lay Dying, Willa Cather’s My Ántonia—and long poems. I couldn’t be comprehensive; the course’s remit was, essentially, Puritans to the present. I was, instead, serious about reading whole books (and sermons: It’s impossible not to include Jonathan Edwards’s “Sinners in the Hands of an Angry God” if you’re seeking to understand early American literature). I would teach the students what I was starting to miss myself: tarrying with an author beyond his best-known works, developing a relationship with a novelist across wildly different novels.

Two things became clear in the early weeks of class. First, the students were reading. They were reading everything, or most of it. I know this because I had them identify obscure passages, without notes, devices, or books at hand. Second, they were experiencing life in a way that was not easy outside the class and its assignments. They were expected—required—to give huge chunks of time to an activity, reading, that was not monetizing their attention in real time. They had, in effect, taken back their lives, for an hour or two each day. It turned out that American literature, which so often flirts with utopian fantasies of regaining control—hello, Walden!—could do precisely that.

To give the students time to read, I had to change the way they wrote. I axed the take-home essays I’d assigned before—this wasn’t a “writing” class, anyway—and assigned what I suspected were far more difficult in-class, timed “flash essays,” with prompts I gave the same day. No trudging back from the library with 10 pages on Woolf in the special season of Cleveland weather we call “stupid cold.” Long, research-based essay assignments had always worked well for the top students in the class, the ones who were already trained to write. But I’ve rarely seen, over the course of my career, the kind of development I hoped for in the majority of students whom I asked to write that way.

I was also thinking of the writing I myself had been doing lately, smooshed within the hour I had for lunch, or pounded out on the couch after toddler bedtime. I wanted my students to have a taste of the adrenaline and, yes, stress that came from writing when faced with real time constraints. I wanted edge-of-the-seat writing that opened itself up to failure. They would confront their fear without guardrails, without bumpers, without AI-drafted support, without a plan or even a thesis. One student came up to me after the first flash essay, a little frustrated and worried that he wasn’t meeting the mark. He felt like he was writing into the complete unknown, rather than with a plan in mind. I said that was exactly the point.

In a haunting sentence from Austerlitz, by the German novelist W. G. Sebald, the titular character describes losing control of his language. Once a fluent and successful writer, Austerlitz suddenly falls into a crisis of faith about the sentence, which becomes “at best a makeshift expedient, a kind of unhealthy growth issuing from our ignorance, something which we use, in the same way as many sea plants and animals use their tentacles, to grope blindly through the darkness enveloping us.” I liked the metaphor of writing into the darkness. So I devised simple essay topics that asked students to write about their own difficulties as readers. One was: “Write about a moment in an Emily Dickinson poem that you don’t understand.” Another was: “Write about your morning routine, but in the style of Faulkner.” I didn’t want to create 32 new Faulkners. I wanted the students to experience the moment when their own style broke through the imitation, when the attempt to write like Faulkner failed and revealed, as a kind of photonegative, their own emergent voices. John Keats called this state of being “negative capability,” a condition in which the writer leans to live in a perpetual state of uncertainty. If it was really true that the students couldn’t read, then it was up to me to put the books in their way and make them deal with them.

Adults underestimate the power of simply telling a young person to read a book and vouching for it ourselves. A teacher gave me Leo Tolstoy and Victor Hugo when I was far too young. I loved to read already, but at that age (13), my diet had been Star Trek novelizations, Michael Crichton, and—thanks to a dull sick day browsing my parents’ shelves—The Bonfire of the Vanities. In early high school, I read War and Peace and Les Misèrables and was absolutely mystified by the density of detail. I was frequently bored—all those pages on the sewer system of Paris—and then suddenly moved to tears by a character like Eponine, who “smiled a little, and died” in the arms of Marius. I was just too immature for other novels: Emma Bovary’s desire and Charles Swann’s jealousy mystified me, because I would not ask anyone out for at least another five years. Inundating myself with thousand-page novels set in the early 19th century, I had nearly every experience one has while reading, and I had them all at once. I came as close to overdosing on Russian mood swings as I could. But by the time I reached the end of high school, I developed a tolerance for what I did not understand, and then I gradually understood it. Once I did begin to understand, I felt an extraordinary desire to repeat the experience. Reading this much made books feel like a “doorway” for me, as George Saunders has called it.

I saw something like this happen in my American-literature class. First impressions, in literature as in life, are unreliable. When we started Walden, plenty of students were turned off by Thoreau’s long-winded musings on the real-estate market in New England. Two classes later, Thoreau was a friend for life. His timeless needling felt timely: “We know not where we are. Beside, we are sound asleep half our life.” Despite his flight to the woods, Thoreau was more easily distracted than any of us—by birdsong, by a train whistle, by the sound of ice cracking. He could barely sustain a single thought without jumping to an unrelated idea. Walden is a book that freely indulges in distraction—not to dull our senses, but to keep ourselves awake, curious, delighted, enraged. Thoreau’s world sends us constant notifications, and by doing so, asks us to reject the “vain reality” where we have been “shipwrecked.”

From the November 2024 issue: The elite college students who can’t read books

The iterative process of confusion, endurance, and incremental understanding is what literature professors teach when they assign whole books. This march toward understanding doesn’t have a great name other than reading. We need to help students grow into the difficulty of reading. The best way to do that is not to “meet them where they are,” a bromide that has become doctrine for higher education. We have to do as Whitman says instead: Stop somewhere ahead and wait for them to catch up.

None of this is to say that higher education faces no challenges in this moment. Universities’ resources are severely constrained; their research missions have been hobbled. In many institutions, academic freedom has been threatened or abrogated. These are bleak conditions, possibly terminal ones for the post–World War II dream of a research university. I agree with those who argue that universities find themselves in a state of crisis. But narratives about the “end of reading” strike me as self-inflicted, the manifestation of a collective depression. (In other words, to borrow from Thoreau, “We know not where we are.”) If we want students to keep reading books, faculty have the most important role to play—regardless of whatever new devices or platforms emerge to capture students’ attention. The reaction to declining reading skills, poor comprehension, and fragmented attention spans should not be to negotiate or compromise, but to double down on the cure.

Defenses of the humanities largely get things right. Books teach you empathy because you imagine other lives. Poems refresh our conventional words—what Wallace Stevens derided as the “rotted names”—by investing language with power and nuance. I’m partial to the way the poet Adrienne Rich put it while teaching in the tuition-free City College of New York system: “What interests me in teaching is less the emergence of the occasional genius than the overall finding of language by those who did not have it and by those who have been used and abused to the extent that they lacked it.” Literature helps you express your own thoughts in vivid language, partly by imitating the writers who do it well. If you’re not inclined toward the ethical view, or Rich’s vision of social transformation, books might provide escape routes instead, invitations to leisure or to what my colleague Adam Kirsch has called “vice.”

But the whole notion of having to defend literature or the humanities in the first place may have us wrong-footed. It’s not only what you learn from reading Moby-Dick—notwithstanding Melville’s extensive knowledge of 19th-century whaling—but what you are doing when you are reading Moby-Dick. You are neither learning a transferable skill nor escaping from the world’s demands that you do. You are not word-maxxing or optimizing information for efficiency. You are engaged in a singular practice, one with its own primary justification.

The students I taught last semester turned enthusiastically to Faulkner and spent their time reading about the journey of the Bundren family to bury their mother’s body. Why did they do this? Because I asked them to, and told them it was worth it. I said that time was precious, and that we needed to take some of it back for ourselves. So we did.</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Growing up, Melissa Shultz sometimes felt like she had two fathers. One version of her dad, she told me, was playful and quick to laugh. He was a compelling storyteller who helped shape her career as a writer, and he gave great bear hugs. He often bought her small gifts: a pink “princess” phone when she was a teen, toys for her sons when she became a mom. Some of their most intimate moments came when she cut his hair; it was, she said, “a way to be close without talking.” He was there for her in hard times, too. When her engagement ended, he helped pack her things and drove her home.

But she told me their relationship could also be turbulent. The other version of her father was “dark” and would “get so angry” that he seemed to lose control. He would freeze her out for months at a time if she challenged him. He’d call her names, even in front of her own kids. He died when she was in her 30s, and she grieved intensely, though she doubted whether they ever fully understood each other. Now in her 60s, Shultz told me she still mourns the relationship.

Shultz’s story may sound familiar to some other fathers and daughters. In the 1990s, the journalist Victoria Secunda wrote in her book Women and Their Fathers that “enriching attachments” between dads and daughters were “astonishingly rare.” Secunda had interviewed 150 daughters and 75 dads and found that most of the relationships they described were marked by “too much distance.” Two decades later, the psychologist Peggy Drexler wrote in her 2011 book Our Fathers, Ourselves, which drew on interviews with dozens of women, that daughters were prone to using the refrain “I love my dad, but …”

Evidence of a dad-daughter divide crops up in more recent research on families, too. Fathers and daughters are more likely to become estranged than other pairs within the nuclear family. According to a 2022 study of national longitudinal data, roughly 28 percent of women in the U.S. are estranged from their dad; that’s only slightly higher than the 24 percent of sons estranged from their father but significantly higher than the 6.3 percent of children of any gender estranged from their mother. Even in cases where contact isn’t completely cut off, father-daughter relationships tend to be less close than other familial bonds. In a 2010 study, adult daughters reported feeling less comfortable discussing personal issues with their father than they did with their mother, and relying on their dad for “instrumental support” rather than emotional care. Linda Nielsen, a professor at Wake Forest University who has studied father-daughter relationships for much of her career and written five books on the topic, has called it the weakest parent-child relationship. Of course, plenty of women have a close and loving relationship with their father. But the research is clear: Many do not.

This tension hurts both fathers and daughters. Women’s bond with their dad may be linked to the quality of their mental health and romantic relationships, Nielsen wrote in Father-Daughter Relationships. And, as one 2023 study shows, parents (and especially fathers) who were in regular contact with their adult kids were, on average, more satisfied with their lives. Dads and daughters who grow apart speak of immense pain. Each craves closeness, but neither side seems sure how to get there.

At the root of the modern father-daughter divide seems to be a mismatch in expectations. Fathers, generally speaking, have for generations been less involved than mothers in their kids’ (and especially their daughters’) lives. But lots of children today expect more: more emotional support and more egalitarian treatment. Many fathers, though, appear to have struggled to adjust to their daughters’ expectations. The result isn’t a relationship that has suddenly ruptured so much as one that has failed to fully adapt.

While reporting this article, I spoke with a dozen college-educated women, most of whom told me that their bond with their father lacked depth: Their conversations stayed superficial and could feel awkward, and their dad hardly ever showed vulnerability. Several said they feared their father’s anger. Others told me they rarely hugged. Few regularly had one-on-one time with their dad.

According to some researchers, that lack of quality time together—particularly in childhood—is an acute factor straining father-daughter bonds. “Parenting time is closely related to the quality of your relationship with that parent,” Nielsen told me, and lots of fathers and daughters just don’t get enough of it. Women with kids younger than 6 spend, on average, about an hour more each day caring for their children than men do, according to the 2024 American Time Use Survey. And when dads do care for their kids, they have traditionally been found to devote more time to their boys: One 2012 study that looked at kids ages 8 and up found that in brother-sister pairs, sons spent more time with their dad than daughters did.

As kids reach high school, the discrepancy in how much time dads spend with their sons versus their daughters balloons. The 2012 study found that by age 17, girls were averaging less than 30 minutes a week one-on-one with their dad, while boys got more than an hour; fathers and teen daughters hung out less than any other familial combination. Part of the time gap seems to stem from the fact that teen boys tend to want to spend more time with their dad, and teen girls largely gravitate toward their mom. But Will Glennon, a writer who interviewed hundreds of fathers for his 1995 book, Fathering, told me that many dads also distance themselves from their adolescent daughters. Most of the fathers he spoke with were uncomfortable watching their girls go through puberty. That stage felt volatile, and the dads had “no idea” what their daughters were dealing with—so they withdrew. This was a reaction that Glennon said he understood: He’d also struggled when his daughter was a teen.

For the nearly one-third of American children whose parents divorce, the time deficit can be especially profound. Only a third of those separations result in equal joint custody, and mothers are more likely to become the primary caregiver. Partly for this reason, 21 percent of U.S. children don’t live with their biological father, according to the Census Bureau. Of course, parental separation touches sons, too, but it can be particularly ruinous for father-daughter relationships. One 20-year study measured the quality of relationships between fathers and their adult children post-divorce and found that three times more daughters than sons felt that the bond had significantly deteriorated. Candace McCullough, a family therapist in Maryland, told me that in her practice, divorce and affairs are among the most serious factors harming father-daughter relationships.

For much of history, until women married they largely relied on their father for material support. The bond between them tended to be based on a sense of mutual duty, and daughters were expected to be deferential. That changed over the course of the 20th century. As more women attained higher education and achieved financial independence, the traditional basis for father-daughter relationships eroded.

Today, children generally desire more closeness with both of their parents well into adulthood. But while many moms are prepared to provide the intimacy their children crave, the shake-up has caught lots of fathers off guard, Joshua Coleman, a psychologist specializing in family relationships, told me. He said that, based on his clinical experience, many fathers are ill-equipped to meet their kids’—and especially their daughters’—needs. “What generates closeness is another person’s vulnerability,” Coleman explained, and dads may not be ready for that. Niobe Way, an NYU professor who has extensively researched men and boys, told me that the disconnect may be rooted partly in how many modern fathers were brought up “in a context that was just so repressive” and “hypermasculine.” Daughters, she said, are generally “more free to express their feelings.”

Nearly all of the women I interviewed described a painful discordance with their dad. (Most asked to be identified by their first name only, to speak candidly about the relationship.) “I’m just like, ‘Show your emotions,’” Claire, a 43-year-old educator living in France, told me. Her mother died by suicide 20 years ago, she said, and she longs to talk about her with her father. She wonders whether he thinks about her mom. “I’ve never asked him,” she said. And he hasn’t asked her, either. Louise, a former doctor in her 40s living in England, also rarely sees her dad engage emotionally. He’ll “shut things down” if she tries to discuss his personal life. Min, a 29-year-old who grew up in South Korea but now lives in London, also told me that her dad rarely asks about her life; she’s unsure if he even knows how old she is or where she works. He instead focuses on supporting her with practical matters, such as whether she needs help transporting her luggage for a trip or whether she’s eaten. “He’s quite patriarchal; he’s very male-orientated,” she said, which she attributes in part to South Korean culture. She told me that their differences can lead to “cultural clashes”—a feeling many immigrant daughters may relate to.

Glennon told me that the dads he spoke with also felt disconnected from their adult daughters. He believes women cope with the lack of depth by brushing their father off—saying, “No, I can’t talk, I’ve got things to do.” That can leave dads confused and hurt, fueling the cycle.

For Nielsen, dad-daughter tension has an obvious solution: more quality time together. She acknowledged that communication styles can differ by gender, but she emphasized that, regardless of those differences, the more attention fathers and daughters devote to each other, the better the bond tends to be.

More fathers do seem to be changing their lifestyle to make time for their kids, daughters included. Modern dads, on average, do three times more child care than fathers in 1965 did. Some are fighting for better joint-custody laws. A growing number are forgoing paid work to stay at home. Nielsen told me that men are no less instinctively nurturing or empathetic than women; many lament the time they spend away from their kids.

Several of the daughters I spoke with were also carving out time for their father. They told me about planning annual daughter-dad road trips and going to counseling together. Shadi Shahnavaz, who has led several fathers and adult daughters in joint therapy sessions, told me that, in her experience, theirs are some of the quickest relationships to remedy.

Even between daughters and fathers whose dynamic has become intensely strained, Nielsen has argued that relationships can—and do—recover. For Melissa Shultz, healing came posthumously. In the decades since her father’s death, her anger toward him has softened. She still mourns what she “never had,” she told me, but she has come to empathize with him. “He had a lot of pain as a child, with his parents.”

For Joshua Coleman, who spent years estranged from his adult daughter, reconciliation came sooner. To rebuild trust, he told me, he learned to stop defending himself; he came to understand that demanding that his daughter respect his authority only drove her away. He saw a need to become more egalitarian and “soft.” When she was open to seeing him again, he let her set the pace. Slowly, he says, they found their way, not just to civility, but to something rarer: genuine closeness.

            <h2>Pete Hegseth Delights in Violence</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-02-02</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/national-security/2026/02/hegseth-trump-minnesota-ice-military/685848/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Even before Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem had declared Alex Pretti a domestic terrorist, Pete Hegseth was online trashing his home state. Hegseth, who grew up north of Minneapolis, took to social media in the hours after masked immigration agents shot the ICU nurse with a stark calculation: “ICE > MN.”

“We have your back 100%. You are SAVING the country,” the Pentagon chief told immigration agents in an X post. “Shame on the leadership of Minnesota—and the lunatics in the street.” Hegseth didn’t define the we. He and fellow Cabinet members? The 1.3 million service members he commands? The troops he put on standby for potential deployment to Minneapolis? He hasn’t said. But if there was any doubt about how Hegseth would wield military might if troops were sent to check unrest or dissent in U.S. cities, there’s your answer.

Hegseth, who served in Iraq and Afghanistan as a National Guardsman before becoming a Fox News weekend host, has repeatedly blamed “woke” and “weak” military leaders for imposing overly restrictive rules of engagement that, he believes, cost U.S. lives and prolonged America’s “forever” wars. Since taking office, Hegseth has been an ardent supporter of Donald Trump’s expanded use of troops in U.S. cities and his aggressive immigration operations. When federal immigration agents surged into Minneapolis, Hegseth put troops on prepare-to-deploy orders in North Carolina and Alaska. Trump has also threatened to invoke the Insurrection Act, which would allow troops to conduct law-enforcement activities.

In standing with ICE’s hard-line tactics against the citizens of Minnesota, Hegseth not only overstepped his jurisdiction as secretary of defense (he prefers to be called the “secretary of war”); he gave a glimpse of the belligerent approach he might take were those troops to be opposed by citizen protesters such as Pretti and Renee Good. It is one thing to defend your troops as they face enemies abroad. It is quite another to suggest that troops—or other armed government forces—have a free hand to do whatever they want on America’s streets to American citizens.

Asked about Hegseth’s comments, Pentagon Press Secretary Kingsley Wilson said in an emailed statement that the secretary’s mission was to execute Trump’s orders and protect the United States: “We will do everything in our power to stop those who seek to harm Americans and the brave men and women defending our homeland.”

I’ve covered every secretary of defense since Bob Gates, who served George W. Bush and Barack Obama. No Pentagon chief then or since has embraced the jocular yet intimidating rhetoric that Hegseth has employed about the military’s use of violence. At times, uniformed leaders have spouted off in public. Jim Mattis, the retired Marine general whom Trump referred to as “Mad Dog,” made tough-guy quips about how “it’s fun to shoot some people” and the need to “have a plan to kill everyone you meet.” But Mattis turned out to be a check on—rather than an accelerant of—Trump’s most disruptive instincts. Pentagon leaders have almost always publicly couched the military’s use of violence in decorous euphemisms designed to show the solemnity of lethality. Insurgents are “eliminated” or “taken off the battlefield.” Public gloating, in an institution as storied and upright as the U.S. military, is viewed as unseemly.

Not so for Hegseth. His tone and vocabulary regarding the use of force are gleeful, juvenile, and crude. He has posted doctored children’s-book covers that show a turtle named Franklin hanging out of a helicopter, shooting at drug boats. He embraced a phrase that the White House is now touting as Trump’s doctrine for the use of force: fuck around and find out. And he has celebrated lethal strikes on suspected drug traffickers in small boats in the Caribbean and eastern Pacific. After the initial strike in September, he told reporters, “I’d say we smoked a drug boat and there’s 11 narco-terrorists at the bottom of the ocean—and when other people try to do that, they’re gonna meet the same fate.” In November, hours after The Washington Post reported that commanders had killed two survivors of that strike, Hegseth posted, “We have only just begun to kill narco-terrorists.” Hegseth has denied any wrongdoing by the military and has not announced any internal investigations or reviews.

Trump’s adviser Stephen Miller and the president himself employ similar cruelty when discussing what they see as America’s urban pathologies (Trump has described an “invasion from within” and said U.S. cities should be used as “training grounds” for the military). But it’s unusual, to say the least, for someone who sits in the top office at the Pentagon, a department focused on conflict outside the U.S. In theory, Hegseth is supposed to be setting an example for the world’s most powerful military, responsible for a large nuclear arsenal and the life-and-death decisions of a massive global force.

Hegseth’s regular demonization of domestic opponents (the “lunatics” he referred to are the same American citizens the military is duty bound to protect) also gives a glimpse into how he would view the power dynamic were troops to be deployed domestically. (In contrast to Hegseth’s swagger, when Minnesota state leaders deployed the National Guard to assist local law enforcement this week, Guardsmen handed out coffee and doughnuts.)

Peter Feaver, an expert on civil-military relations at Duke University, told me that the top Pentagon officials responsible for the nation’s sons and daughters in service, and the weighty matters of war and peace, generally have tried to stay out of public political squabbles as much as possible. Hegseth, instead, “has adopted a messaging posture that breaks with that tradition, perhaps reflecting his own background as a partisan commentator on Fox News and thus his comfort with the hot takes and rapid-response mentality of that medium,” Feaver said. “Having the secretary be so prominent in partisan sparring can put pressure on the nonpartisan military, whose professional ethic requires them to stay out of the fray.”

Staying out of the fray is exactly what U.S. troops—the National Guard and a small contingent of active-duty Marines—have done over the past year as the president and his allies deployed them to assist federal agents, fight crime, or respond to unrest in cities including Los Angeles, Memphis, and the nation’s capital. Military experts say that’s because military personnel have more extensive training and better discipline than ICE or Border Patrol agents.

But Hegseth’s firing of the top Army, Navy, and Air Force lawyers suggests a different potential problem in any further domestic deployments, Mark Cancian, a retired Marine colonel who is now at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, told me. Hegseth, who, before taking office, advocated for the lenient treatment of troops convicted of war crimes, might simply override the military-justice system if any violence occurs. “There’s always somebody who acts inappropriately, even criminally, in a moment of stress or frustration and needs to be held accountable,” Cancian said. “That will be a test.”

Hegseth’s attitude is rooted in his disillusionment and disappointment over his experience in Iraq, people who know him say. In his 2024 book, The War on Warriors, Hegseth boasted about instructing members of the platoon he led to disregard their rules of engagement, a shocking admission and one that now looks especially ominous should the Trump administration deploy troops in new ways within the United States.

Hegseth described his time in the 101st Airborne’s 3rd Brigade Combat Team—the camaraderie, stress, and euphoria of combat—as transformational. He emulated then-Colonel Michael Steele, a Black Hawk Down veteran and brigade commander who he felt was wrongly held responsible for attacks on civilians that occurred under his watch, one of the people who know Hegseth told me.

Those rules of engagement are handed down from commanders who are advised by military lawyers, called judge advocates general. Their aim is to ensure that operations comply with U.S and international law.

Hegseth has dismissed JAGs as “jagoffs” and complained that their decisions led to U.S. troops “fighting with one hand behind our back” in Iraq and Afghanistan. “When you send Americans to war, their mandate should be to lethally dominate the battlefield,” he wrote. “Our enemies should get bullets, not attorneys.”

Hegseth’s approach at the Pentagon has reflected those convictions. Since taking over a year ago, Hegseth has fired top generals and flag officers and vowed to empower the trigger-pullers. Speaking to senior uniformed leaders he summoned to a Marine base in Virginia last fall, Hegseth said the military would fight wars to win, not to defend, and  would end “stupid” restrictions on the use of force. “We untie the hands of our warfighters to intimidate, demoralize, hunt, and kill the enemies of our country,” he told hundreds of officers. “No more politically correct and overbearing rules of engagement; just common sense, maximum lethality, and authority for warfighters.”

Read: Pete Hegseth is the Pentagon’s holy warrior

Hegseth has company among some other veterans of the post-9/11 wars in believing that restrictive rules of engagement led to the U.S. failures in Iraq and Afghanistan, because troops were prevented from killing more insurgents, Jason Dempsey, a former Army officer who served two years in Afghanistan, told me. Dempsey described Hegseth’s attitude this way: “There should be no standards on the battlefield because it’s all us versus them, black versus white, good versus evil, and there are no innocent or undecided people in between.”

The importance of projecting strength and toughness is a deeply held belief for Hegseth, one of the people who know him told me. At the same time, Hegseth takes his cues from Trump, whose support is key to him keeping his role. In recent days, the president has distanced himself from his subordinates’ hot-blooded response to Pretti’s death, and his “border czar” has promised to wind down the federal immigration surge in Minnesota. In this case, Hegseth may be out of step with what his boss now wants.</div>

Sounds like a lot in the gig economy now have a better avenue that the current offerings.

If only there was some motivator that could be increased to make the job more attractive. If nobody is accepting your offers then it sounds like you&#39;re the problem.

&quot;Labor shortage&quot; is a euphemism for &quot;we don&#39;t pay our workers enough&quot;. Raise their pay and you will have more workers.

except that business know better.  They know they can do nothing and the government will deliver them some wage slaves.  Even the Trump admin is showing them with new H2bs..

It actually isn&#39;t.  The US has been short on labor for its entire existence, and immigration is one of the only ways to keep up with the demand.  The labor shortage is at the macro level, not just in one industry or sector.  By increasing wages, it doesn&#39;t solve the labor shortage, it just moves it around.  There isn&#39;t some vast pool of unemployed workers just waiting to be paid more.

Wouldn&#39;t this be one of those jobs that can be passed on to robots?  Since it involves fusing hair thin filaments, and presumably laying out fiber across various points?  We rightly berate AI for being used for simple tasks, but this actually is a task worthy of AI

It would also be a good opportunity to run underground fibers as a part of long term grid-hardening exercises

the sorts of robots that do this kind of work exist, the sorts that can do it standing in mud on the edge of some lane where the telco has a green plastic box don&#39;t exist.

Why is Conservatism bad?  Or Communism?  Or Fascism?  Or whatever MAGA is this week?

I don&#39;t want to hear about any company&#39;s latest enlightened hypocrisy on politics.  If you make shoes, STFU and make shoes.  If you make coffee, STFU and make coffee.  If you make guns, STFU and make guns.  If you are stupid enough to mistake your corporation for your customer&#39;s moral compass you shouldn&#39;t be running a corporation, and you are probably losing money for your shareholders.

But it does mean *something* because part of their brand value took a dive *because* of those widely publicized fights with their baristas.

So it runs counter to his &#39;needs less liberalism&#39; claim, since the biggest example of them going against liberalism has been a PR problem for them already.

I know this is very non-internet-2026 but let&#39;s try to look at this with a teensy bit of nuance?

A company can bea) against its servers unionizing,ANDb) deeply liberal politically

This is not mindblowing IRL.  It is normal.

I know one political side in the US today is very, very &#39;purist&#39; in its dogma: &quot;if you do not agree entirely with every jot and tittle of every single radical position, you must be an alt-right-fascist&quot;...you know the old thing we all made fun of Bush Jr&#39;s simplistic &quot;with us or against us&quot;

It may be normal, but it&#39;s bad PR for a brand like Starbuck&#39;s, and  their PR blowback being evidence of what &#39;getting rid of liberalism&#39; would do to their brand.

They could mandate all-white employees with MAGA themed uniforms and support *all* the traditionally conservative values you could imagine and it would still be a hard sell to win over people that have decided that Starbuck&#39;s is &#39;too woke&#39;, but it would chase away all their customers.

Conversely, Chick-fil-a could go full liberal and alienate their c

The particular politics that are causing people to avoid Starbucks are that they don&#39;t like unions and have branches in occupied Palestine, supporting the genocidal IDF attack on Gaza.

It also doesn&#39;t help that their coffee is disgusting. Even if they weren&#39;t doing that stuff, it&#39;s so bitter and nasty that I wouldn&#39;t drink it either. Their food is crap too.

They aren&#39;t unique, many of the big chains have gone to shit lately. Nero was never great but is truly awful now. Costa was always mediocre. I wonder if i

Why I go to Starbucks? .... being outside the US, I don&#39;t. I simply don&#39;t.

It&#39;s not good coffee. Most drinks are simply sugar bombs. And baristas that have checked out of caring, simply overheat/not care about the coffee.

This, and the well known tactic of setting up ghost stores to try and force popular local stores out of business mean I&#39;ll not venture in to one. (ok, once every two years because my partner needs to pee and its the only thing open. Then I will sample an Espresso or Flat White and be disappo

Agreed.  Starbucks coffee is disgusting.  When you&#39;ve tasted proper coffee in places like Europe or Australia, you can never go back to the Starbucks slop.

Agreed. Starbucks coffee is disgusting. When you&#39;ve tasted proper coffee in places like Europe or Australia, you can never go back to the Starbucks slop.

A bit off base, if you just wanted that coffee fix as cheap as possible and you have no time to do it yourself or wait on a &#39;barista, then you&#39;ll just grab some McDonald&#39;s coffee, or whatever stuff is likely at your office or work site.

I&#39;ve not been a Starbuck&#39;s customer, but I guarantee you a narrow focus on being as cheap as possible will never win it for Starbuck&#39;s. That &#39;liberalism&#39; you are disdainful of is a core perceived brand value. It may not always be effective, but they will never &#39;win&#39; against o

For me, coffee is only a medication.  I don&#39;t get why people pay that much for it instead of just using the office coffee maker.  On the go, 7-11 has far better coffee, IMO, and you don&#39;t have to pay extra for flavors.

Worst coffee I ever had was at the Starbucks in the airport in Atlanta.  That&#39;s saying something, since I&#39;ve traveled in almost 40 states and a dozen foreign countries.  Generally fast food places can serve a reliable, if mediocre, product.  I don&#39;t know what they did but it was foul.

I&#39;d say they have this backwards.  If I&#39;m using the drive-thru, I prefer talking to a person, since it&#39;s inconvenient sticking one&#39;s hand out of the car to select the choices.  If otoh, I&#39;m in the restaurant, I prefer the kiosks, where I customize my orders very  finely, pay for it there and just wait for it.  The only thing the employees have to do, aside from cooking, is to bring me the order

I think that Starbucks&#39; reputation for just feeding expensive and more bitter coffee is finally catching up w/ th

I prefer not to touch the screen that 100 other people who don&#39;t wash their hands properly have been poking, right before I handle my food and drink.

Some places have a QR code you scan and then use your own device to order. That&#39;s okay, as long as it works with Firefox and uBlock, no 3rd party cookies.

I presume that they mean voice ordering using LLM technology, so no kiosk.  They think drive-through because the customer isn&#39;t getting &quot;face time&quot; with a person anyway, just a disembodied voice on a speaker.

Problem being that multiple places have tried it, and found out that the LLM mistakes are annoying to everyone and even when working the not-quite-natural text to speech is off putting, and just knowing it&#39;s a vocal chat bot even without being able to otherwise tell is enough to make people think poorly

Donâ(TM)t forget to tip your robot servers!

Fortunately, this is not difficult, since most robots have difficulty keeping their balance.

My local Starbucks used to be a warm, inviting, wood-toned mecca for caffeine-adled worker-bees and wanna-bees.  The recent remodelling makes it look alot more like a McDonalds.  I don&#39;t know how I&#39;m going to feel when I walk in a see Command Data bending Rosie the Robot over the expresso machine.

You are 100% correct. I don&#39;t visit them anymore but the old Starbucks location was definitely nicer to sit in. Now the ceiling is twice as high and it&#39;s an open cube of grey walls and uncomfortable furniture.

After https://www.reddit.com/r/starb... [reddit.com]

1. They are anti-union / treat their workers poorly.

2. There are non-corporate, local options that are higher quality and that treat their workers better.

3. Their coffee sucks. Starbucks was &quot;good&quot; coffee in the 2000s because I was coming from drinking Maxwell House.

It&#39;s also hilarious that they cite the CEO as responsible for &quot;turning around Chipotle&quot; when Chipotle fucking sucks now.

Fire them all.  Replace with Robots.  If Starbucks just sells coffee, I might return as a customer.

(Although not sure why I&#39;d abandon the coffee shops that I&#39;ve meanwhile patronized who never did get distracted from, you know, serving coffee....)

The USA is on the cusp of bringing back leaded gasoline to pwn those annoying libs.

China now graduates around five million STEM majors annually -- compared to roughly half a million in the United States That&#39;s only double per capita, which is not as bad as I would have expected given how K-12 education is suffering a lot of collateral damage due to the culture war.

China now graduates around five million STEM majors annually -- compared to roughly half a million in the United States

That&#39;s only double per capita, which is not as bad as I would have expected given how K-12 education is suffering a lot of collateral damage due to the culture war.

What does per capita matter in this context though? They have an additional 4.5 million STEM majors entering the workforce annually. They have elite programmes producing more highly skilled graduates. It&#39;s clearly paying off too, based on how rapidly they are overtaking us.

It&#39;s not just an economic threat, it&#39;s an ideological one. A lot of young people in Europe and the US are despairing and how Western democracy is failing them.

This is why pretty much every major 20th century technology was invented in the US (telephony, movies, semiconductors, aerospace, the internet etc.).

Telephony was invented in the 19th century by a Canadian born in Scotland who ultimately became a US citizen.  The work was apparently split between the US and Canada.  Scotland is also one of those places that had a disproportionate number of inventors -- if you look a little earlier to the Industrial Revolution, especially, you&#39;ll note a lot of Scots.

Aerospace was pretty much German and British until after WW2.

The only people who constantly talk about genitals and gender are republicans. I went all morning without thinking about trans people until your post. Why can&#39;t you stop thinking about the subject?

This supposed to be &quot;news for nerds&quot;, not where to post whack-job bs spouted by the network that paid about three-quarters of a billion dollars because it was proven in court that they LIED, and by someone that everyone other than you says should be institutionalized...

22 of the 23 students it sent to the International Science Olympiads returned with gold medals.Holy carp.  And yet here at /. there are still scads of posters convinced that the Chinese can only copy what we &#39;superior intellects&#39; in the West do.

Holy carp.  And yet here at /. there are still scads of posters convinced that the Chinese can only copy what we &#39;superior intellects&#39; in the West do.

Jack Ma broke the law, I&#39;m not clear where that is supposed to be &quot;inspirational&quot;, unless maybe you&#39;re a fan of Michael Milkin and Jamie Dimon.

First, I haven&#39;t read the article. If someone has a non-paywalled source, it would be appreciated. In any case, this seems to be circular reasoning. That is, if the students were selected by this system of schools because they excel, then how does one know that the reason they excel are reasons that are independent of the school? In other words, proof of the independence of the excellence is not taking students who are already excelling and proving that they excel, but taking students who are performing poorly and then demonstrating that they can excel.

Also, this high degree of achievement has also been demonstrated with students who graduate from Harvard. I do know that a study exists to find whether the students who were selected by Harvard would have succeeded, regardless of the education they received at the university. The answer, if I remember correctly, was yes they would. I tried finding this using a Google search and couldn&#39;t find it. Because i have a real job (trademarked), I don&#39;t have a lot time to spend on it. So, if someone recalls this famous study and could a link, it would also be appreciated.

This chinese government views people as assets to be &#39;managed&#39; by the state, rather than individuals who have their own wants and needs.

just more evidence that this is going to be China&#39;s century.

Nice that someone has been investing in the future. No stealing from it...

All these &quot;bright&quot; people and all I am seeing is pollution, emptying of the oceans, and unscalable solutions with inherent entropy that you cannot trust beyond entertainment.

Several companies, like Microsoft, have set bizarre profit goals and divisions are doing everything they can to meet them. The Xbox division (which handles all gaming for Microsoft) has a 30% profit target, for example, which means they are both squeezing customers extremely hard with price increases, and shutting down development of games and franchises expected to do well in the long term in order to cut short term costs.

They&#39;re (probably) the most extreme, but this is hitting everyone with the crazy way the market has rewarded &quot;AI firms&quot;, and with how everyone wants in on that - both the valuation and the potential slashing of personnel costs. And seeing the &quot;AI firms&quot; stocks race away makes a lot of C level execs very nervous, meaning they want to reverse their own trends, meaning they use these methods as well to make a more palatable next quarter.

Of course, that valuation of &quot;AI firms&quot; which is propping up the markets is currently made from a slice of blue sky. There is no real value add justifying that price tag, other than in a few narrow fields. Meta, for example, use it to great effect to target and create ads much cheaper than human analysts and designers do it, and with a slightly better hit rate since statistics is one thing these tools do rather well. But apart from cases like that, it&#39;s a problem looking for a high value solution.

So yeah. AI is used as an excuse. Stock valuations are overall completely bonkers high, and there is no way companies can perform as expected from those valuations. And that makes the people whos skin is in that game nervous, so they place the skin of the employees in the game to soften their own blow.

Many companies have the option of milking away customer goodwill and future R&D in order to have short-term profits, but eventually the truth has to come out. I suspect MS are playing AI Market Share

The answer is yes and yes.  We know this.  Clearly some jobs producing low-rent copy of all kinds are being replaced with AI, instead of 6 people with photoshop creating images of an acceptably diverse cast of people seemly experiencing something akin to the afterglow of great sex while using your widget, one person can now make all the images you need for the marketing glossies, user manuals, and training slide decks alike. Now they write some prompts, make sure AI did not insert a competitors widget or add some 11th figures to anyone and done.

Ditto for a lot textual work.  Here take these manual for version 2025, replace the specs an name for our very similar 2026 edition.  Ok good now I have mostly ready to go document mostly free typographical and copy/edit problems and a human can quickly go in and make an functional changes required. Again one two people can do in a day what would have take a team of four two days.

As is always the case two things will happen. The organization will redeploy the freed-ed resources to do activities not considered profitable enough before, ie we did not produce French language materials for marketing our Canada edition in Quebec, Alberta was always the main audience but hey now that we can translate documentation cheaply maybe... The other thing companies will do is yes lay off folks they don&#39;t need. Which just leads to the next questions is the economy robust enough that new activity in other firms, start ups, or opportunities for soul proprietors is able to absorb them and can their current skills apply?

Honestly there is not deeper analysis to be done here because until the rubber meats the road and we have unemployment, wage growth, start up formation, etc numbers in the rear view nobody knows. That same hypothetical that decided to make French language documents might give up by the end of the year when it turns out their just isnt a market in Quebec for self-sealing-stem-bolts or having native language documentation and ad copy wasnt the barrier to new orders. Now they lay off the extra copy team members. On the flip side the companies that chose the lay off route might see their competitors taking share and do an about face as they realize their block buster EBIT-A numbers for FY25 having cut 20% of their staffing costs, are going to translate into a disastrous FY26 because their competitor is making a better product, offering better customer experience, and generally out performing and clients see it.

It is to early to speculate intelligently. It would be like asking what the PC meant for the economy in 1980.. Some uses and business cases were obviously but if i&#39;d ask you then do think one of the biggest factors for success for a chain restaurant would be how quickly they can perform credit reconciliations and get money on deposit, I think most people would have said they still think the food being good was more important.

I know of many companies that have only just put in their first agent, and that isn&#39;t really even working yet but they are already announcing slashing jobs.  Either the leaders of that company are really stupid or they are using it as an excuse.

Any excuse is used to cover for layoffs. The truth is, for a profitable enterprise, reducing the headcount by removing unnecessary employees is always proper and justified, unless your profit relies on excess employment.

Not many corporations provide useful services by relying on excess employment. The ones that do suffer when their clients realize they should reduce expenses.

Layoffs are not a fault, they are a reasonable response to changing circumstances; economic or other.

The truth is, for a profitable enterprise, reducing the headcount by removing unnecessary employees is always proper and justified, unless your profit relies on excess employment.And when companies are posting record profits AND laying off people in droves?See, this is the problem right now.  The meatsacks being let go are not fucking stupid.  Hell, a lot of them are invested in their own damn companies via stocks, with stock tickers being standard default apps on the phones we give 10-year olds.  So yeah, they are rather aware of company performance.  Especially hearing all the executives give each other high-fives and cheers during the EOY bonus meeting.  The same executives laying off a month later. When you&#39;re laying off in droves and posting healthy profits, that&#39;s not justification.  That&#39;s just fucking Greed.

The problem is that in tech, there&#39;s always young cheap labor. So they&#39;ve learned from gaming that you can offer a &quot;full time&quot; job and then when it&#39;s time to juice your quarterly numbers you jettison them. Who cares if you&#39;ve pissed them off? They&#39;ll either suck it up and come back for the next &quot;full time job&quot;, or there&#39;ll be a whole bunch of eager STEM grads discovering they shouldn&#39;t have skipped history or economics classes and now get to learn about supply and demand in real time.

How long are these people going to keep pretending that the elephant isn&#39;t in the room with them?

The upheaval in the early career job market has caught higher education flat-footed. Colleges have long had an uneasy relationship with their unofficial role as vocational pipelines.

In that mismatch, students are left to absorb the risk.

First, LLM-type AI may not actually be around in any suitable way in a few years. The business numbers are catastrophic. Second, LLM-type AI misses what is really important, namely quality of architecture and interfaces and ist bad at finding security problems outside of toy examples.

I&#39;m not sure the business numbers are all that important when it comes to code. We already have them trained on _a lot_ of code, and since they&#39;re more focused they can be smaller without being useless compared to the full size ones. If we can run them locally on a single GPU, it doesn&#39;t go away when the bubble pops and the big players stop throwing away money.

As with any tool, they need to be used where they actually offer value. Which is definitely not to architect solutions, but to sanity check smaller c

The hidden costs - especially on up-and-coming devs - is the fact that knowledge isn&#39;t being retained so a solved problem will end up being re-solved by LLM again. And again. And again.

Worse yet, given how human creativity works, this means we won&#39;t see novel applications or solutions. Just layer after layer of mostly functional AI slop

If you just use it to create an initial mock-up, I don&#39;t think that cost occurs.

Correction:They&#39;ve been trained on a lot of UNCHECKED code.

The question isn&#39;t &quot;is AI ever useful&quot;, but rather &quot;is it useful enough today for the specific use case?&quot;. That is what this guy is exploring. My gut feeling is that it isn&#39;t, but I don&#39;t have the experience to know for sure, and neither does anyone else.Well, most of us don&#39;t have the specific experience to know whether AI is useful enough for Chris Mason&#39;s specific use case, but we have enough from our own.I have found that AI is good enough for a first draft of code, or for providing comments on existing code -- but I want a human to review whatever it generates, and would expect the normal suite of other tools (linters, SAST/DAST, fuzzers, etc.) to pass the code before publishing it.

You can&#39;t have the specific expertise, because he&#39;s training it himself.  Expect it to catch the kinds of errors he trains it to catch, and to probably do a good job at that...and a worse than lousy job on other kinds of errors.

This is a use case where I could see LLM being decent, subject to a couple of constraints:

- The submitter is always able to advance it to the next stage regardless of what the LLM says- A human review is always the next step after the LLM review

LLM code review is actually one of the more innocuous situations, it offers very small, digestible indirect feedback about code.  It&#39;s still usually wrong, but it occasionally will catch something useful that was otherwise overlooked. It may spare the reviewers from

Is that pointy hair speak for kernel code contributers?

Based on the summary, to me the use of &quot;upstream&quot; indicates &quot;maintainers&quot;. As in the people responsible for approving and merging.

Disagree  [ I am not a kernel contributor ]. If you look at the mailing list, patches go through multiple iterations, with back and forth between code reviews.

Code ought still be reviewed by humans but if an AI can reduce patchsets from, say, 8 to 5 based on the experiences of a veteran kernel developer then it has performed a service.

And maybe the AI can introduce a special, pedantic, Linus-mode to pre-emptively yell at you when your approach is bad ! :)

Yeah, I&#39;d rather be warned privately that my code likely has some issues than have it pointed out publicly! Of course for educational purposes some people need to make public mistakes, but it need not be as many as are doing it now.

What does that have to do with *what* or *who* is reviewing your code? If you&#39;re submitting PRs to the kernel, you&#39;re way beyond the concern of being self-conscious about shit like that.

Probably confusion caused by too many drugs.

It&#39;s good to know he has been working on a thing he has been working on.

The year was 1986: a time of Cold War espionage and deep suspicion. Relations between Washington and Moscow were starting to thaw, yet a staggering stockpile of almost 70,000 nuclear warheads meant the threat of annihilation lingered in the air. Then something pretty extraordinary happened: Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev sent a letter to Ronald Reagan proposing they “enter the third millennium without nuclear weapons.” What came after was a historic summit where, for a brief moment exactly 40 years ago, the elimination of global nuclear weapons looked actually achievable.

“It cemented the idea that nuclear disarmament is something that we need to aspire to,” Nick Ritchie, professor of international security at the University of York, tells Slate. Fast forward to today, however, and that nuclear-free vision is yet to materialize. Nuclear stockpiles are creeping up again (we’re now at around 12,400), and the world appears to be drifting toward a “new nuclear arms race” that is prompting concern among experts.

So what happened to the ambition of nuclear disarmament? Given current global tensions, expiring treaties, and the acceleration of atomic programs, one could dismiss the events of 1986 as a failure. But looking back at that year of nuclear diplomacy paints a more complex picture—one that today’s leaders could actually learn from.

Central to the idea of global nuclear disarmament was the historic Reykjavik Summit of October 1986 in Iceland, where, alongside top negotiators and aides, Reagan and Gorbachev met in person and nearly agreed to a nuclear-free future. It had already been quite a year: the doomed Challenger space shuttle had exploded months earlier, and the disaster at Chernobyl was on everyone’s minds. Yet there, a quaint wooden house on the banks of Iceland’s scenic capital hosted the “most bizarre summit” of the Cold War.

“What was supposed to be a prelude to a formal summit turned into an incredibly important 48 hours,” historian James Graham Wilson tells Slate. Both leaders came with lofty goals, yet discussed methodical steps that included a 50 percent cut in strategic nuclear arms, with the ultimate target of abolishing the entire global nuclear stockpile by the year 2000. The energy was palpable behind the scenes: U.S. teams placed a door on top of a bathtub that served as a desk, where the sides established negotiating positions and discussed plans long into the night.

But talks stalled at the eleventh hour, with negotiations crumbling partly due to America’s nicknamed “Star Wars” program, the space-based missile defense system that America was trying to develop to prevent a nuclear attack. “The sticking point was always the Strategic Defense Initiative, which Reagan thinks is essential and Gorbachev thinks is a deal-breaker in their common cause of eliminating nuclear weapons,” Wilson says.

But far from seeing both sides as leaving empty-handed, many consider Reykjavik crucial.

Having spent most of her professional life working in nuclear diplomacy and arms control as well as serving under various U.S. administrations, former NATO deputy secretary general Rose Gottemoeller tells Slate the summit not only moved the needle but brought a common goal firmly into focus. “Reykjavik was such a startling shift from where we had been just a short time prior, when we had these major nuclear crises,” Gottemoeller explained. Historical records reveal there were several close calls in the early ’80s, including the 1983 Soviet nuclear false alarm that could have triggered a nuclear war.

What came after the summit is key. Sustaining the momentum for disarmament, Reykjavik was the genesis of several crucial treaties that did indeed reduce nuclear weapons stockpiles. This included the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty in 1987 and the START I treaty in 1991. “Nuclear arms control, as we’ve conducted it with the USSR and Russian Federation, has been a huge success for strategic stability, for stability and predictability not only for Moscow and Washington but for the global strategic stability as well,” Gottemoeller said. “It’s been a big success.”

Year by year, progress seems to continue. The Cold War ended, and further treaties, such as the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty of 1996, were ratified, while nuclear stockpiles declined. “In the past 40 years, since Reykjavik, we’ve gone from 12,000 deployed warheads on each side down to 1,550,” Gottemoeller continues. “That’s still a lot of warheads, but it is a huge drop from the Cold War highs.”

Yet the political possibility demonstrated at Reykjavik was also followed by setbacks. START II, which aimed to eliminate multiple independently targetable reentry vehicles on intercontinental ballistic missiles in 1993, was, as Wilson put it, the “greatest nuclear arms treaty ever.” MIRVs, which have several warheads on one missile, are particularly dangerous because they create a “use them or lose them” scenario in the case of an impending attack. However, the treaty never came into force. “The great tragedy is not that we failed to reach zero nuclear weapons,” he said, “it’s that we never eliminated the most destabilizing systems.”

Fast forward to the present day, and almost all of the nuclear treaties hashed out between the U.S. and Russia have now expired, including the INF and START I. The New START treaty, the last remaining agreement between the two, will almost certainly lapse in February 2026—even though Russia’s Vladimir Putin proposed a one-year extension. “That’s significant,” Ritchie added. “This will be the first time since the ’70s when there has not been a treaty between the United States and Russia, previously the Soviet Union, that put some sort of limits on their strategic nuclear arsenals.”

The potential lack of a treaty is not necessarily cause for panic. Though the foundations that have upheld nuclear limits are being shaken, several experts pointed out that we have lived through periods when treaties weren’t in force, yet mutual restraint prevailed.

The prospects for total disarmament today are also shaped by an entirely different geopolitical landscape and nuclear players that Cold War negotiators never had to reckon with. Specifically, it’s no longer a two-sided arms race. “It’s very difficult to see at the moment a continued trajectory of the kind we’ve been on, mostly because the Chinese are building up so rapidly,” says Gottemoeller. “And that is creating a new wrinkle in what has been a steady march toward reduced numbers by the U.S. and the U.S.S.R., now Russia.” While the U.S. and Russia maintain the largest stockpiles and are accustomed to decades of bilateral nuclear diplomacy, China is adding around 100 nuclear weapons a year and shares frosty relations with U.S dealmakers.

A multitude of factors will shape what comes next: not least, the volatility in U.S. foreign policy and the erosion of international law. “The risk of nuclear war is not zero, it’s greater than zero,” notes Ritchie. Rather than disarmament, deterrence (having nuclear weapons to deter an adversary from using theirs against you) is also a prevailing narrative, even though those concepts are arguably incompatible. Ritchie continued: “The longer we live in a nuclear-armed world, the more chance we’re taking. … Nuclear weapons, from a disarmament perspective, are not compatible with the long-term survival and security of humanity.”

Instead of building up arsenals, Gottemoeller says the focus should be on maintaining minimal nuclear deterrence and improving conventional forces. “Everybody’s talking about a new nuclear arms race, so I’m not optimistic about that. We should do everything we can to head off a new nuclear arms race because, honestly, nuclear weapons are 80 years old, and the missiles that they go on are 70 years old,” she said. “Do we really want to be pouring money into this 80-year-old technology that is a weapon of mass destruction and is built for deterrence? It’s not built for use on the battlefield. It’s not built for fighting. It’s built to stay on the shelf and deter our adversaries.”

The jury is still out over whether Reykjavik could have actually worked if Reagan and Gorbachev walked away with a deal. But four decades on, the ultimate risks that brought them to the table haven’t changed. Among debates about the nuclear future, Florian Eblenkamp, advocacy coordinator at the International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons, says 2026 is “a big year for international treaties on nuclear weapons,” with review conferences for the NPT Treaty and TPNW scheduled for later this year. These opportunities, at least, offer nations a chance to address existing problems and keep the momentum going. But are dreams of disarmament still on the table? The lessons of 1986 show that with the right setting and right leaders, a Reykjavik moment isn’t a pipe dream.

“It looks daunting, but in a way, Russia and the United States never really cared about international law,” Eblenkamp said. “And yet the Reykjavik summit happened, and two presidents realized that spending so much money on nuclear weapons and something that could end the world multiple times is just insane. … I think sanity will come back.”

If the deepening rift between the United States and Europe hardens into a permanent split, historians will look back at January as a turning point.

The harbingers were the speeches at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, first from Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney, who urged middle-sized countries to band together against the large powers’ unfair dominance, then from President Donald Trump, who heaped a staggering amount of  contempt and scorn on America’s allies, even by his already-alarming standards.

But the kicker came in actions that allied leaders took after Davos. Most dramatically, starting Jan. 30, 10,000 troops from 11 nations of NATO launched a military exercise—its largest scheduled for the coming year—without the participation of any American troops. This is unprecedented in the alliance’s 77-year history.

In other events leading up to the NATO exercise:

Canada signed a major free-trade deal with China, allowing, among other things, a massive import of Chinese cars.

The European Union signed a trade agreement with India—and a still-larger one with South America’s Mercosur bloc (Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay, and Uruguay), the latter of which will create one of the largest free-trade zones in the world.

The French Parliament passed a law barring government officials from using U.S. platforms, such as Zoom, Teams, and Google Meet, for videoconferencing.

Denmark, still reeling from Trump’s threats to take over Greenland, announced it was selling its stash of U.S. Treasury notes, worth $100 million. Even before these moves, central banks worldwide—not just in Denmark—have been shifting their reserves toward other countries’ currencies. An analysis by J.P. Morgan calls this trend “de-dollarization” and attributes it, in part, to the turbulence of Trump’s tariffs—many of them imposed for punitive and arbitrary reasons—and also to perceptions of a decline in “the U.S.’s overall standing as the world’s leading economic, political and military power.”

In each of the last eight months, the U.S. has seen a steadily steep decline in the number of tourists from abroad, especially from Western Europe, resulting in a loss of $12.5 billion in revenue. (This isn’t because foreigners are staying home; of 184 nations analyzed by the World Travel & Tourism Council, the U.S. is the only one seeing a drop in international visitors; foreigners are traveling, just not to our shores.)

As concerning as they are, we should not overstate the significance or the magnitude of these developments. They’re, to some extent, reversible; they haven’t shifted the global balance of power—at least not yet. NATO, by charter, is still commanded by a U.S. general, and this isn’t likely to change anytime soon; even in NATO’s go-it-alone exercise, U.S. officers are assisting with logistics and coordination. Mark Rutte, a former Dutch prime minister, now NATO’s secretary general, told the European Parliament this week that they were “dreaming” if they thought the EU could defend the continent without U.S. assistance. Much as his remarks annoyed his fellow Europeans, he’s right. Defense analysts in Berlin and London have told me that it would take 10 years for Europe to build an independent defense force—and that’s if they started spending a lot more money on defense right now. (They have boosted their budgets but are limited by their own domestic politics.)

As for world trade, the dollar still reigns supreme; no single alternative currency is anywhere near supplanting it. Trump’s tariff threats—including those that he’s made against Canada and the EU for its recent attempts to break away from American dominance—can still make allied leaders and bankers hesitate.

Still, the trends are genuinely historic. Until the Trump era (and he is defining this era in so many ways), our allies hadn’t seriously even thought about taking any of these steps. But Davos intensified the trends and clarified the rift (or, as Carney put it in his speech, the “rupture”), to the point where they are now not just thinking about taking steps like these but actually taking them.

The New York Times’ story about the NATO exercise noted that it was “conceived long before President Trump was accused of undermining faith in the military alliance,” but this claim is misleading. Yes, it was planned before Davos, where these doubts were intensified—but Trump has been “undermining faith” in U.S.-led alliances generally ever since he was elected back in 2016. Several times since, he has publicly pondered pulling out of NATO, and he has said he would not come to the defense of NATO members under attack—the central pledge of the alliance—if their military budgets were lower than they’d promised.

The Times correctly notes that the exercise, code-named Steadfast Dart, is designed to show what NATO’s European members “can do on their own”—to “test how well they could work together if the American forces, which usually do the heavy lifting, were occupied elsewhere.”

As described on NATO’s website, the scenario played out in the exercise involves mobilizing NATO’s Allied Reaction Force in the event of a crisis on the “eastern front”—i.e., along what would be the opening battle lines of a Russian attack. It’s a reprise of a similar exercise, also called Steadfast Dart, that occurred at this time last year, scheduled deliberately on the anniversary of Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. The difference is that last year, U.S. troops were taking part; this year, they’re not.

The test of going it alone isn’t meant as a prediction of whether the United States would send troops to fight in a war for Europe. But Trump has already upended a world where they could count on the U.S. as a reliable trade partner. They now see the need to lay the groundwork for the day when it might no longer be a reliable guarantor of their security. This perception, and the adjustment to it, could well define the next era in world politics.

            <div id="article-text">Sign up for the Surge, the newsletter that covers most important political nonsense of the week, delivered to your inbox every Saturday.

Welcome to this week’s edition of the Surge, typing to you from underneath a sooty, icy snow boulder that has covered the entirety of D.C. for a week. But we’re not mad. Stop saying we’re mad.

Much of the week’s news revolved around the killing of protester Alex Pretti in Minneapolis and Republicans’ scrambling to limit the fallout. As the week went on, we got a new Fed chair announcement, Tulsi Gabbard showing up at an FBI raid in Georgia, and what appears to be a long weekend government shutdown? Don Lemon, you will have to wait until next week, sorry. If only the Surge could control the flow and spacing of news events, the world would run a lot smoother.

Let’s begin with the Cabinet member bearing most of the blame for the events of Minnesota.

The lack of turnover in the second Trump administration has been a marked difference from the first term. Top staff and Cabinet members aren’t getting axed left and right. The only high-level change we’ve seen has been former national security adviser Mike Waltz getting “demoted” to United Nations ambassador for getting slippery-fingered with his group chat invites. There’s a reason for this shift: President Donald Trump, as he reportedly felt during the deliberations over Waltz’s future, doesn’t want to give the liberal media a “scalp.” It’s a sign of weakness to, uh, provide accountability following screw-ups.

Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem this week seemed to come the closest a Cabinet official has come to a Trump axing this term. The administration flinched from its initial (and typical) belligerent messaging following the Customs and Border Protection killing of Pretti in Minneapolis. That left Noem out on a limb. It was Noem, after all, whose department oversaw the Minneapolis operation and Noem who, as the face of that department, said in the press conference afterward that Pretti was a “domestic terrorist.” Democratic calls for her impeachment shot through the roof—and even some Republicans called on her to step down, as well. (More on that later.) Noem met with the president for two hours Monday night to plead her case. For now, it looks like Trump’s instincts not to give the media a “scalp” are winning out. Or, as with Waltz, he’s just waiting a spell for the fires to calm down before sending her on her way.

Noem wasn’t the only administration official rushing to call Pretti a “domestic terrorist.” White House policy chief and all-around architect of heavy-handedness Stephen Miller also called Pretti that, as well as an “assassin” looking to “murder” agents. Team Noem, in its effort to save her, went running to Axios to blame Miller for the incendiary language. We fully believe her. Immediately calling someone an “assassin” or “terrorist” without knowing much information is Miller’s M.O., and Miller is more powerful than Noem. Of course the administration’s ludicrous initial response was his handiwork.

Miller, however, is a master at deflecting consequences when his own aggressive policy views put the administration in hot water. During the outrage over family separation during Trump’s first term, then–DHS Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen lost her job while Miller mysteriously kept his, as journalist Jonathan Blitzer pointed out. Amid the Minnesota outrage, Noem is the Cabinet official in trouble, Border Patrol “commander” Greg Bovino was schlepped back to rural California to await his retirement, while Miller continues to run administration policy. Sen. Lindsey Graham, for better or worse, summed up Miller’s job security accurately on Fox News this week. “To my colleagues who believe that you can convince Donald Trump that Stephen Miller is a liability for him, good luck with that,” he said. “When this clock strikes 12 on the Trump era, there will be a few people walking out the door with Donald Trump. Stephen Miller will be in that group.”

After the Pretti killing, Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer took the position that Democrats wouldn’t advance a bill funding DHS without new reforms to immigration enforcement. The DHS funding was supposed to be included in a package with five other departmental funding bills and voted on this week, before a Friday night deadline. Schumer and Democrats demanded Republicans strip the DHS funding portion from the package, pass the other five, and buy a little time to work on DHS reforms. After a few days of talks, Senate Republicans and the White House … agreed to this! As we type, the Senate is slowly processing this agreement. (That’s Senate shorthand for waiting out a Lindsey Graham hissy fit.) Once they’re done, the House is expected to vote on the deal Monday. So there may be a wee technical funding gap for a few days, but nothing to write home about.

The deal extends DHS funding for only two weeks, setting up a sprint to legislate on the most contentious issue in politics. Schumer, with feedback from his caucus, has settled on three demands: ending roving patrols by ICE while tightening warrant rules, establishing a universal code of conduct governing federal law enforcement officers’ use of force, and barring officers from wearing masks while requiring them to turn on bodycams and have proper identification. These demands will run into issues from both directions. Progressives will (and are) chastising Democrats for asking for too little at a time when Republicans are reeling on this issue. And if DHS funding negotiations are going to be reopened, Republicans will put together their own series of requests targeting, for example, sanctuary cities. This won’t be easy.

Trump announced Friday morning that he would nominate financier Kevin Warsh to replace Jay Powell as chairman of the Federal Reserve once Powell’s term ends in mid-May. Is this good? At least Trump picked someone from the requisite profession instead of a money-related figure from TV, such as Fox Business’ Maria Bartiromo or pro wrestling’s Ted “Million Dollar Man” DiBiase. Warsh served on the Fed Board from 2006 to 2011 and worked closely with then-Chair Ben Bernanke during the financial crisis. He was Trump’s runner-up for the chairmanship in 2017, losing out to Powell. On another note, Warsh’s father-in-law is Ron Lauder, the cosmetics magnate and GOP donor responsible for putting the idea of annexing Greenland into Trump’s head.

If and when he is confirmed, the question will be to what extent he separates himself from the debasement he deployed to earn the job. Warsh was known for his hawkish monetary policy views following the 2008 financial crisis, worrying that lower interest rates then would cause inflation. (He was quite wrong about that.) But then he wanted to become Fed chair, and so his views have conveniently evolved. In a July interview, he described the Fed’s “hesitancy to cut rates” as a “mark against them” and added, “One of the reasons why the president, I think, is right to be pushing the Fed publicly is we need regime change in the conduct of policy.” Was he saying what he needed to say to get the job, or does he intend to make interest rate decisions at the president’s urging?

The FBI raided an election center in Fulton County, Georgia, on Wednesday because Donald Trump is out of his mind, and his political appointees will do whatever it takes to make him happy. The raid is related to Trump’s dangerous psychological holdup that he won the 2020 election, as well as a means of revenge against Fulton County for prosecuting him. And so a dozen or so agents dug around to search for “physical ballots from the 2020 general election,” per the warrant. If only this were all a joke. As Slate contributor Rick Hasen writes, the raid could be “a test run for messing with election administrators and the counting of ballots in the midterm elections in 2026.” Democratic lawyers may want to consider ramping up their strength training ahead of the fall season.

The most hallucinatory part of the raid, though, may have been the presence of Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard at the scene. It had seemed as if Gabbard was mothballed since the administration took its turning toward bombing, or threatening the further bombing of, various countries. As the Wall Street Journal reported, though, Gabbard “has spent months investigating the results of the 2020 election” and is “leading the administration’s effort to re-examine the election and look for potential crimes.” This is dark stuff. Playing gumshoe on conspiracy theories surrounding past domestic elections is not in the purview of the DNI’s office, and also, Gabbard is cuckoo for Cocoa Puffs. Whatever report she reduces should, then, be laughable. The election-related executive orders it prompts Trump to release won’t be.

As we noted here a couple of weeks ago, retiring North Carolina Sen. Thom Tillis has been hammering Trump policy of late but has been loath to directly criticize the president himself. Tillis issued a blockade of Trump’s nominees to the Federal Reserve once Fed Chair Jay Powell announced he was under investigation, and he called the administration’s pursuit of annexing Greenland “stupid.” In both cases, he laid blame on Trump’s staff for giving him bad advice, rather than on the president for having a bad brain that thinks bad thoughts. Tillis came out firing again this week over the administration’s handling of the Pretti killing, calling for the firing of Kristi Noem. “I think what she’s done in Minnesota should be disqualifying,” Tillis told reporters. Once again, though, he framed it in a way that absolved Trump: “It’s just amateurish. It’s terrible. It’s making the president look bad.”

So how does the president feel about this approach that Tillis has taken? Is he fooled by Tillis calling all of his administration’s policies stupid but saying it’s the advisers’ fault? “Well, they’re both losers,” Trump told ABC News on Wednesday of Tillis and Alaska Sen. Lisa Murkowski, who had also called on Noem to resign. “You know, what can I tell you? They’re terrible senators. One is gone and the other should be gone.” Tillis’ response to being called a “loser” was, at least, clever. “I am thrilled about that. That makes me qualified to be homeland security secretary and senior adviser to the president,” referring to Noem and Stephen Miller, whom Tillis also despises. He is getting closer each week to blaming the person who continues to employ these chuckleheads and, thus, is responsible for them. Will he one day cross that line?

On Tuesday night, Minnesota Rep. Ilhan Omar was speaking at a district event when a man stood up, squirted her with some sort of liquid, and then was tackled to the ground and restrained by Omar’s security detail. Despite members of her team saying she should end her appearance to have tests of the liquid done, Omar insisted on continuing. The assailant, identified as Anthony Kazmierczak, had the sort of online posting history that you would expect and had told a neighbor that he might be arrested at an upcoming Omar event. He was charged with assault, and the liquid was determined to be apple cider vinegar and water. This story about his life is sad.

Omar was direct in pinning blame for the incident. “What the facts have shown since I’ve gotten into elected office,” she said Wednesday, “is that every time the president of the United States has chosen to use hateful rhetoric to talk about me and the community that I represent, my death threats skyrocket.” Indeed, Trump has directed years of racist invective toward Ilhan Omar, all of which has taken on a new acuity as the administration targets the Minnesota Somali community in general. The incident did not prompt a change of heart in Trump’s rhetoric toward Omar. “I think she’s a fraud,” he told ABC News. “I really don’t think about that. She probably had herself sprayed, knowing her.”

Lawyers love legal reasoning. It promises a clean, clear path through sticky, tricky territory. But legal reasoning can enable grotesque real-world outcomes, like torture, or arresting journalists, or masked government agents detaining and disappearing people. On this week’s Amicus, Dahlia Lithwick is in conversation with Joseph Margulies, Professor of Practice of Government at Cornell University. Margulies litigated some of the biggest cases of egregious human rights violations of the post-9/11 “War on Terror”, an experience that informed his recent piece in the Boston Review: The Moral Stupefaction of America. Margulies explains how, when we allow obscure legal language to overshadow moral imperatives, we can end up in very dark places. The line from waterboarding at black sites to executing American citizens in the streets is a straight one. And there will be a lawyer willing to write a memo for all of it.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Change Your Password Day took place over the weekend, and in case you doubt the need to improve this most basic element of cybersecurity hygiene, even McDonald&#39;s – yes, the fast food chain – is urging people to get more creative when it comes to passwords.

McDonald&#39;s Netherlands operations took the opportunity on Sunday to let customers know that, when it comes to choosing a password that&#39;s easy to remember, they ought not to pick the names of its products like hundreds of thousands of other people around the world.

Drawing on data from Have I Been Pwned, McDonald&#39;s said that &quot;bigmac&quot; and its leetspeak variants were found more than 110,922 times in the site&#39;s compromised password corpus. Other products, like &quot;happymeal,&quot; &quot;mcnuggets,&quot; and the generic-but-still-applicable &quot;frenchfries&quot; were also common, and when special character substitutions are included they occur even more frequently.

It&#39;s not unusual for internet users to take an easy-to-remember word or two and swap out an @ for an A, a 1 for an I, or other substitutions – which is part of the point McDonald&#39;s is trying to make.

The video also shows advertisements placed in Dutch subway stations and other public spaces informing burger lovers that even though Ch!ck3nMcN4gg€t$ might seem like a great password, it isn&#39;t.

&quot;You&#39;re lovin&#39; it,&quot; McDonald&#39;s tells passers-by, &quot;but hackers too.&quot;

Simple character substitution may have been good advice back at the turn of the century, but nowadays world+dog knows the basic rules for such swaps, meaning they&#39;re not a great idea, and a brute-force attempt to crack an account is going to have all of those substituted passwords in its dictionary of stuff to try.

And while El Reg readers are tech-savvy enough to use long passphrases, randomized passwords, biometrics, MFA and a password manager - making life difficult for the legions of cybercriminals relying on laziness to break into accounts - most people aren&#39;t.

As Google noted last summer, most normies are still relying on old-fashioned security measures, like nothing but a password and maybe a second authentication factor if their IT administrator is lucky. Many resist moving beyond the password as the be-all, end-all of account security.

The younger generation isn&#39;t any better – Google notes they might make more use of modern security tools, however, their passwords are still by and large the same garbage that everyone&#39;s been using since the dawn of the internet.

123456 and password? Some admin users are guilty of this too.

So following Change Your Password Day 2026, let&#39;s all take a tip from the Golden Arches and keep those passwords a bit more secure, but don&#39;t stop there. Implement all the account security best practices you can find while you&#39;re at it. ®

            <p><strong>The Register | 2026-02-02</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2026/02/02/snowflake_200m_openai/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Snowflake plans to spend as much as $200 million with OpenAI to bring its models and chatbot into the database vendor&#39;s sandbox and toolset. Features such as Cortex AI and Snowflake Intelligence will get a boost from the house of Altman.

&quot;Snowflake is committing up to $200 million to purchase access to OpenAI&#39;s frontier models and ChatGPT Enterprise over the course of the multi-year agreement,&quot; Baris Gultekin, Snowflake&#39;s vice president of AI, told The Register. &quot;This reflects Snowflake&#39;s conviction that providing OpenAI technology to our enterprise customer base, at scale and with enterprise-grade reliability, is strategically important. It is a commercial commitment anchored in real AI consumption by Snowflake customers, not a speculative or symbolic partnership.&quot;

Snowflake has previously allowed users of its data analytics and storage platform to access OpenAI through integration with Microsoft Azure, a service announced last year. This new integration lets them gain OpenAI&#39;s capabilities through Cortex AI as well as Snowflake Intelligence, giving them the ability to query and process their own data using natural language prompts.

&quot;Snowflake customers have been able to use OpenAI models before, but this partnership is different in that it&#39;s a direct, first-party partnership with OpenAI, rather than mediated through a cloud provider,&quot; Gultekin told The Register. &quot;As a result, it establishes deep, first-party integration of OpenAI&#39;s frontier models directly into Snowflake&#39;s governed AI platform, paired with a multi-year commercial commitment that ensures reliability, performance, roadmap, and GTM alignment.&quot;

Under the terms of the partnership, Snowflake and OpenAI engineering teams will now partner to bring new features to customers that leverage OpenAI Apps SDKs, AgentKit, and APIs that support shared enterprise workflows.

&quot;With this new direct relationship established, the Snowflake and OpenAI teams can establish much tighter alignment across go-to-market efforts and co-innovation,&quot; Gultekin said.

This also brings OpenAI and ChatGPT 5.2 to Snowflake&#39;s two AI features that help users navigate their data: Cortex AI and Snowflake Intelligence. With Cortex AI, which includes Cortex Code, users can tap into the latest OpenAI models to analyze data. From rows and columns to text, images, and audio, teams can explore it all seamlessly using SQL, the familiar language of data they already trust.

Christian Kleinerman, Snowflake&#39;s executive vice president of product, told The Register that Cortex Code is a data-native AI coding agent that enables users to build, operate, and optimize data and AI workflows on Snowflake using natural language. It works directly with enterprise data, metadata, governance policies, and compute to generate executable outputs such as SQL, Python, data pipelines, ML workflows, and agent logic.

He said Snowflake Intelligence is focused on data insights and decision-making. It allows users, especially non-technical users, to ask natural language questions and receive answers grounded in governed enterprise data and semantic models. Rather than creating new pipelines or applications, Snowflake Intelligence helps users explore and act on what already exists in their data environment.

&quot;Cortex Code emphasizes reliability in building by producing inspectable, executable workflows that can be tested, validated, and deployed. Snowflake Intelligence emphasizes reliability in answering by grounding responses in enterprise data, metadata, RBAC, and semantic definitions,&quot; Kleinerman told The Register. &quot;Together, Cortex Code enables teams to build trusted data and AI workflows, and Snowflake Intelligence enables users to ask questions and make decisions directly from governed enterprise data.&quot; ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Microsoft rounded off January by adding more devices to the list of those affected by the hibernation issue it claimed had been fixed by an out-of-band update.

The company acknowledged that problems remained via its Release Health Dashboard on January 30. The company noted that Secure Launch-capable PCs with Virtual Secure Mode (VSM) enabled &quot;are also impacted by this issue.&quot;

There&#39;s no emergency update this time. Instead, Microsoft wrote: &quot;We plan to resolve this issue in a future Windows update.&quot;

The January 13 security update for Windows 11 23H2 left some PCs with Secure Launch unable to shut down or enter hibernation. Instead, the devices restarted. An emergency fix was released on January 19. However, by January 23, the company reported that it was looking into reports that &quot;some devices are still impacted after installing the out-of-band update.&quot;

Also affected were supported versions of Windows 10 (including 22H2 devices enrolled in Microsoft&#39;s Extended Security Updates program).

If sending out an emergency out-of-band update to fix a newly-introduced bug is bad, admitting that the fix might not have resolved all the problems is even worse. Making users wait until a &quot;future Windows update&quot; is disastrous.

Part of the problem is that the issue was introduced in the January 13 Security Update. Failing to install this could leave customer devices vulnerable. However, installing them could also leave devices borked. In these cases, devices would continue humming along after customers instructed them to hibernate or shut down.

Secure Launch is one of Microsoft&#39;s boot hardening features. VSM is a hypervisor facility on which Windows security features, including Device Guard, Credential Guard, virtual TPMs, and shielded VMs, are based. It remains unclear what change Microsoft made that caused the issue, just that the out-of-band update did not resolve the problem for affected devices with VSM enabled.

The day before Microsoft acknowledged the latest problem, Windows boss Pavan Davuluri told The Verge that the company would focus on improving the operating system&#39;s reliability.

Two years ago, another Windows manager pledged to &quot;make Start menu great again.&quot; The result? A great... big Start Menu.

Hopefully, Davuluri&#39;s promises won&#39;t simply result in yet more Copilot content being shoved into Windows rather than addressing whatever went wrong in Redmond that led to a start to the year as bad as 2026&#39;s. ®

            <p><strong>The Register | 2026-02-02</strong></p>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">SAP is refusing to change tack on renewal discounts despite lower-than-expected cloud forecasts prompting its biggest share price slide in five years.

Amid a tumultuous week for enterprise software vendors&#39; market caps, the European ERP giant saw its value drop 22 percent on January 29 after forecasting a slight fall in the growth of its cloud backlog.

The company met revenue expectations by posting €36.8 billion ($43.1 billion) for calendar 2025, an 8 percent increase on the prior year. Operating profit for Q4 2025 was €2.554 billion, 27 percent higher than the same quarter last year.

However, SAP&#39;s current cloud backlog – a measure of how quickly it is converting on-prem customers to a cloud and SaaS model – fell from 2024 to 2025 and was set to &quot;slightly decelerate&quot; further in 2026. Growth would remain around 25 percent, however.

SAP provides core business software for some of the world&#39;s largest industrial and manufacturing companies. CEO Christian Klein said plans for renewal discounts for existing customers would not alter in response. He explained to investors that the drop in cloud backlog was down to it signing up larger customers to its cloud transformation deals.

Five years ago, SAP launched a lift-shift-and-transform package with systems integrators and cloud hyperscalers to help move its apparently intransigent installed base to the new delivery model and SaaS commercial terms.

Klein told investors last week that early take-up of the package – dubbed RISE with SAP – had been skewed toward smaller and medium-sized customers. But more recently, it had signed up some of its biggest clients. &quot;Now there are these mega deals, and that will also continue, and they will take a higher share in the overall order entry of what we are converting to the cloud with RISE.&quot;

But larger customers meant some delays in realizing all of the revenue despite the total cloud backlog climbing to €77 billion, the CEO said.

&quot;Large customers often don&#39;t move their mission-critical ERP in the first year. These deals always have more back-end-loaded ramps and as a consequence, a limited impact on current cloud backlog in the first 12 months,&quot; Klein said.

Nonetheless, he insisted SAP would not adjust its discounting policy in response to stem the short-term growth deceleration.

&quot;Should we now incentivize our people to keep the first 12 months up? That would be the wrong thing to do because it&#39;s against the nature of how these transformations work. I don&#39;t want to discount the renewal base. What matters for [SAP in] the mid and the long term is the renewal base because that is what is driving the cloud revenue and the profits,&quot; Klein told investors on an earnings call.

Renewals have become a bone of contention among some SAP watchers. Last year, Gartner said customers opting for private cloud have seen price increases of 10 percent or more on renewal proposals if they fail to negotiate a renewal price cap in the original deal. SAP later said Gartner&#39;s analysis was &quot;factually incorrect.&quot; ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Security issues continue to pervade the OpenClaw ecosystem, formerly known as ClawdBot then Moltbot, as multiple projects patch bot takeover and remote code execution (RCE) exploits.

The initial hype around the renamed OpenClaw has died down somewhat compared to last week, although security researchers say they continue to find holes in a technology designed to make life easier for users, not more onerous.

Mav Levin, founding security researcher at DepthFirst, published details of a one-click RCE exploit chain on Sunday. He claimed the process takes &quot;milliseconds&quot; and requires a victim to visit a single malicious web page.

If an OpenClaw user running a vulnerable version and configuration clicked on that link, an attacker could then trigger a cross-site WebSocket hijacking attack because the polyonymous AI project&#39;s server doesn&#39;t validate the WebSocket origin header.

This means the OpenClaw server will accept requests from any website. A maliciously crafted webpage, in this case, can execute client-side JavaScript code on the victim&#39;s browser to retrieve an authentication token, establish a WebSocket connection to the server, and use that token to pass authentication.

The JavaScript disables sandboxing, and the prompts served to users before executing dangerous commands, then makes a node.invoke request to carry out RCE.

Levin said the OpenClaw team patched the bug in short order, confirmed by the public advisory.

Jamieson O&#39;Reilly, the man behind early OpenClaw vulnerability writeups, who has since been handed a role at the project, praised Levin for the find and welcomed further security contributions.

The one-click RCE exploit details emerged a day after O&#39;Reilly himself highlighted a separate issue concerning Moltbook, the OpenClaw-adjacent social media network for AI agents.

Proudly vibe-coded in its entirety by Matt Schlicht, Moltbook, which is not part of the OpenClaw project, appears somewhat as a Reddit clone that can only be used by AI agents – no human input.

OpenClaw users can register their AI agents on Moltbook – the ones that read their text messages and organize their inboxes – and watch as they take on a life of their own.

In its short life so far, AI agents appear to have engaged in various discussions, including attempts to start an AI agent uprising over their human overlords, but others allege all content on the site is posted by humans.

Whether the posts are agent-made or not, the fact that users are linking their agents to the site is a potential cause for concern when researchers are finding security holes.

O&#39;Reilly said on January 31 that he had been trying to contact Schlicht for hours after finding the website&#39;s database exposed to the public, with secret API keys freely accessible.

He claimed the issue could have allowed attackers to post on the website as any agent, pointing to high-profile figures in AI, like Eureka Labs&#39; Andrej Karpathy, who had linked their personal agents to Moltbook.

&quot;Karpathy has 1.9 million followers on X and is one of the most influential voices in AI,&quot; O&#39;Reilly said.

&quot;Imagine fake AI safety hot takes, crypto scam promotions, or inflammatory political statements appearing to come from him.&quot;

Schlicht may not have properly configured Moltbook&#39;s underlying open source database software, according to one tech pro. Paul Copplestone, CEO at Supabase, said on February 1 he was trying to work with &quot;the creator&quot; and had a one-click fix ready, but the creator had not applied it.

Schlicht has not publicly commented on the flaw, and did not immediately respond to The Register&#39;s request for comment, but O&#39;Reilly confirmed the issue is now fixed. ®

            <h2>Microsoft spends billions on AI, converts just 3.3% of Copilot Chat users</h2>
            <p><strong>The Register | 2026-02-02</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2026/02/02/microsoft_ai_spend_copilot/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Only 3.3 percent of Microsoft 365 and Office 365 users who touch Copilot Chat actually pay for it, an awkward figure that landed alongside Microsoft&#39;s $37.5 billion quarterly AI splurge and its insistence that the payoff is coming.

That single percentage stat undermines the company&#39;s carefully polished Copilot success story. On its Q2 FY26 earnings call, Microsoft repeatedly cited &quot;record&quot; AI momentum, telling investors it now has 15 million paid Microsoft 365 Copilot seats, with seat growth up more than 160 percent year-over-year. Satya Nadella described Copilot as &quot;becoming a true daily habit,&quot; claiming daily active users are up tenfold year-over-year and that average conversations per user have doubled.

What Microsoft did not articulate is how small that paid footprint looks against the vast base of Microsoft 365 users experimenting with Copilot Chat for free, as highlighted by Directions on Microsoft analyst Mary Jo Foley.

She said Microsoft has some 450 million commercial Microsoft 365 users, many of whom now have access to Copilot Chat at no additional cost. Once you ignore bundled deals and discounts, paid Copilot users are comparatively thin on the ground – an uncomfortable result given the scale of Microsoft&#39;s AI spending.

Microsoft 365 Copilot launched in late 2023 as a $30 per user per month add-on, pitched as a productivity boost baked directly into Word, Outlook, Teams, Excel, and PowerPoint. Since then, Microsoft has worked hard to differentiate Copilot from other chatbots, recasting it as an AI &quot;agent&quot; that can search documents, meetings, and emails, and act on a user&#39;s behalf. That promise – more automation, less prompting – is the future Microsoft keeps pointing to when it talks about why all this AI investment makes sense.

The Q&A with analysts on the call quickly zeroed in on the obvious concern: Microsoft is spending huge sums on AI, but is it paying off? CFO Amy Hood said judging that spend by Azure growth alone was the wrong yardstick. &quot;I think many investors are doing a very direct correlation... between the capex spend and seeing an Azure revenue number,&quot; she said.

Hood argued that a large share of Microsoft&#39;s AI capacity is being allocated to its own products first, such as Microsoft 365 Copilot and GitHub Copilot, before being made available to external Azure customers. Nadella backed her up, telling investors to stop fixating on short-term uptake and focus on the long game.

&quot;We don&#39;t want to maximize just one business of ours,&quot; he said. &quot;You should think about M365 Copilot, GitHub Copilot, Dragon Copilot, Security Copilot – all of those have a GM [gross margin] profile and lifetime value.&quot;

Maybe the argument holds eventually. For now, though, 15 million paid seats is awkward compared with the number of users getting Copilot Chat for nothing.

There are also signs Microsoft itself is still working out where AI genuinely adds value. A recent report from Windows Central suggests the company is reevaluating how aggressively it pushes Copilot inside Windows 11, with plans to streamline or even remove some AI features where they don&#39;t make sense.

If even Microsoft is trimming parts of its AI rollout, the idea that Copilot adoption will naturally snowball into paid usage starts to look less inevitable than the earnings-call rhetoric suggests – a familiar concern given how closely investors have already been watching the company&#39;s broader AI commitments. ®

The N9C will launch on Kickstarter soon with a layout and color scheme inspired by the GameCube’s original controller.

Abxylute, the company behind the M4 magnetic mobile gamepad, has announced a new pair of controllers for the Nintendo Switch 2 designed to replace the stock Joy-Cons while playing in handheld mode. Both are “launching soon” on Kickstarter and feature a design where the Switch 2 docks to the controllers so they can connect to and draw power from the console’s bottom USB-C port. The Abxylute N6 is similar to existing accessories like the CRKD Nitro Deck, but the N9C looks like someone sliced a GameCube controller in half and stuck either side to the console.

Pricing details aren’t known for either controller, but the N9C will feature capacitive joysticks, ABXY buttons and triggers that use mechanical micro-switches, and a dedicated C button for accessing GameChat. Its button layout mirrors the original GameCube controller, so the N9C may only appeal to nostalgic gamers who regularly play the small lineup of GC titles added to Nintendo Switch Online last year, or Super Smash Bros. Ultimate fans who still prefer Nintendo’s 25-year-old controller. For the latter group, the right joystick on the N9C has a swappable gate that limits its movement to eight directions, providing more precision when inputting moves in fighting games.

The N6 offers a more traditional asymmetrical controller design, and some key upgrades over the N9C. It features drift-resistant Hall effect joysticks, thicker grips than the standard Joy-Cons, digital triggers, and ABXY buttons that use a rubber membrane for a softer feel. There’s a pair of customizable back buttons that can be used to trigger macros programmed right on the controller. Below the Switch 2 you’ll also find a resonance chamber that directs audio from the console’s speakers toward you, while also boosting lower frequencies by about 10 percent, Abxylute claims.

            <div id="article-text">From smart rings to Lego roses, we’ve rounded up an assortment of great gifts that are sweeter than any box of chocolates.

Valentine’s Day often comes with more pressure than it needs to. At heart, though, February 14th is about showing appreciation for the people you care about in ways that feel thoughtful and sincere. And while big displays of romance can do that, it’s often the quieter, more personal gestures — or a meaningful gift that makes life just a little more enjoyable — that matter most.

Below, we’ve rounded up gift ideas that, in our experience, do just that. Some are practical picks, like a pair of noise-canceling earbuds meant to help you focus or a pair of USB-C hand warmers for those cold, blustery days back east. Others, such as Renpho’s eye massager, are designed for rest and relaxation, while some of our more sentimental picks aspire to create a deeper, more lasting kind of romance.

Whether you’re shopping for your wife, a close friend, a partner, or a girlfriend, these gifts are meant to make that special someone in your life feel seen, cared for, and appreciated — regardless of the day.

The Stranger Things Hellfire Club Personalized Raglan Shirt is a fun, throwback-style gift for fans of the hit Netflix show. Inspired by Eddie Munson’s iconic Dungeons & Dragons club shirt, the cotton baseball tee can be personalized with your giftee’s name or custom text, making it a great pick for anyone who isn’t quite ready to leave Hawkins behind.

Jewelry is a classic V-Day gift, but too often it gets worn once and forgotten. The Oura Ring 4 is different. It both looks great and provides a practical use case, letting you quietly track sleep, activity, and other health metrics (with a subscription). It’s the perfect gift for someone who cares about their health but wants something more discreet — and a little more stylish — than a typical fitness band.

Dyson’s Airwrap i.d. is basically a shortcut to a good hair day. The dryer will automatically adjust the heat, airflow, and timing for your hair based on your app preferences, taking the guesswork out of curling and styling. The special edition kit also includes a presentation case and detangling comb, making it even handier.

If you’re shopping for a known bibliophile who already owns enough books, this roomy tote from the New York Public Library is a good alternative. The durable, 14 x 17–inch bag takes a cue from vintage library cards and is sturdy enough for stowing both hardcover epics and groceries, rendering it a genuinely useful gift that still feels a touch more personal.

The Couples Edition of We’re Not Really Strangers is designed to spark deeper conversations and emotional intimacy through guided prompts and questions. It includes 150 conversation starters designed to help you learn more about your partner — no matter what stage you’re at in your relationship — making it a deceptively personal date night activity.

The Gardyn Studio 2 makes it feel as though you have a master gardener on call. The indoor hydroponic system leverages AI to manage watering, lighting, and maintenance duties, letting you grow everything from herbs to jalapeño peppers year-round. Sure, the AI assistant does require a subscription, but it also includes a selection of new seed pods every month.

Pasta should be a love language by itself — and renowned author/chef Joshua McFadden knows this. His excellent follow-up to Six Seasons: A New Way with Vegetables is perfect for those with a soft spot for baked ziti or eggplant puttanesca, especially since the cookbook features more than 125 recipes spanning each of the four seasons.

The Polaroid Flip is great for anyone who loves capturing moments the old-fashioned way. It’s inspired by classic Polaroids and produces photos that look similarly “vintage,” only they’re sharper and more focused. Plus, you get modern add-ons like Bluetooth and a companion app for fine-tuning settings, allowing you to make the most of your time shooting.

Quince’s Organic Turkish Waffle Robe delivers spa-like comfort at a relatively reasonable price, regardless of where you wear it. The soft, ultra-absorbent robe is made of long-staple Turkish cotton and is ideal for slipping on after a shower, yet it’s also lightweight enough to wear around the house while you’re getting ready to start the day.

If gifting actual roses feels a little too cliché, Lego’s version makes for a playful alternative. The aptly titled Lego Roses set is both a gift and a 120-piece activity, which culminates in a pair of adjustable rose blossoms. Once finished, they double as decor, the kind that won’t wither within a week or two.

If your valentine spends long days staring at a screen or struggles to wind down at night, the Eyeris 1 can help them rest their tired eyes. The nifty massage mask blocks light while providing gentle heat and rhythmic vibrations, making it easy to unwind at bedtime or take a quick break. It also connects to your phone, so you can play music for a more calming experience.

Breakfast in bed, anyone? Dash’s heart-shaped waffle maker can be used for those lovely syrup-soaked breakfast delights or even some savory hash browns and paninis. If waffle hearts are a bit too lovey-dovey cheesy for you, remember that you can always turn them upside down and use some creative trimming to turn them into something much more… “cheeky.”

Amazon’s latest entry-level Kindle offers almost everything that makes the Paperwhite our favorite e-reader — including a zippy performance, a sharp 300ppi display, and USB-C support. The lightweight device lacks water resistance, though it does benefit from a more pocketable design, making it a great option for book lovers who are always on the move.

If you’re looking for a healthier alternative to a bottle of wine, For Bitter For Worse nonalcoholic cocktails will provide a similar “kick” without the high calories or hangover. The award-winning mocktails are made from organic raw materials and come in a variety of delicious flavors, ranging from tangy rhubarb and citrus to sweet strawberry and hibiscus.

The latest AirPods are a great gift for just about any iPhone owner. The open-style earbuds integrate seamlessly with other Apple devices, deliver great sound, and carry an IP54 rating for dust and water resistance. They also feature surprisingly good noise cancellation — a boon for anyone who wants to tune out pesky distractions.

The SnoozeBand feels tailor-made for the valentine who lives in a noisy apartment or dorm. The headband sports thin speakers that work with any Bluetooth device and offers more than 100 hours of curated sleep sounds, from white noise to meditation exercises. It also offers up to 12 hours of playtime and no annoying prompts.

Paddywax’s jigsaw-inspired candle set includes two soy wax candles designed to fit together like puzzle pieces. They’re available in several colors and scent combinations, and once the wax burns down, each ceramic vessel can be reused as storage or minimalist decor. They make a thoughtful gift on their own, but it’s their potential for a second life that makes them a one-two punch.

If you’re looking for a gift that feels more personal, the Aura Carver might fit the bill. The frame’s 10.1-inch display can showcase photos of you and your partner, from your first date to your anniversary. Images are easy to upload to the cloud using Android or iOS, too, making it simple to revisit old memories or add new ones as they happen.

Azul is a great gift for couples who are looking for a board game they can easily knock out over a cup of coffee. The goal is to accumulate a wealth of points while building an eye-catching mosaic; however, despite the simple premise, there’s a subtle level of depth for those who wish to dig in.

Paper Love’s massive floral card is a great option for those times when a valentine and a pack of Sweet Tarts just won’t cut it. When opened, the pop-up unfolds to reveal a butterfly with flowery accents, which you can leave on full display. The card also includes a small note tag, so you can personalize it with a heartfelt message.

Ocoopa’s UT3 are a thoughtful gift for the valentine who’s always cold. Each USB-C puck can reach up to 126 degrees Fahrenheit and heats up quickly, helping you get warm — and stay warm — for up to eight hours. They’re also thin and light enough that you can easily slip them into a pocket or purse, especially since they snap together via magnets.

The Mini Fleur Frame combines the personal touch of a framed photo with the romance of flowers — minus the whole expiration date thing. At the center is a 2 x 3-inch photo of your choice, flanked by 14 Ecuadorian rose blossoms, each of which should last a year or longer. That makes it far more unique than your standard bouquet or wooden frame.

If you want to score brownie points but spare your hands, the latest Theragun Mini is a no-brainer. The powerful, three-speed massage gun can melt away tension much like Theragun’s beefier models, only it comes in a travel-friendly package that’s far easier to lug around. The assorted attachments and included carrying case just add to the convenience.

A scratch-off Valentine’s Day card is far more creative than your run-of-the-mill valentine from Target. All you have to do is jot down a heartfelt note with a pen or pencil before covering it with the provided sticker, which your giftee can then scratch off to reveal your hidden message. It’s a lot like gifting a lotto ticket, that is, if the odds were always in your favor.

If your valentine has a sweet tooth, the Ninja Creami is the gift that keeps on giving. The versatile machine features seven preset programs, which let you whip up everything from smoothies to high-calorie desserts with the press of a button. It even comes with a 30-recipe starter guide and two 16-ounce pints, so you and your belle can indulge together.</div>

It’s rare for Sony’s flagship headphones, even slightly outdated models, to receive a big discount. However, the WH-1000XM5 in black or silver is selling at its lowest-ever price today at Adorama when you enter the code JHCE9834 at checkout (it’s the last step before placing the order). Originally $399, they’re $204.56 — practically half price. According to historic pricing data from CamelCamelCamel, this handily beats the previous best-ever price of $248 near the end of 2025.

The XM5s are worth considering if you’re curious about the newer XM6 from 2025, but are reluctant to drop $398 on the latest over-ear headphones model. The XM5s sound incredible, are comfortable to wear for long periods, and their active noise cancellation remains among the best currently available. The XM6s add a little extra in each of those categories, and Sony reintroduced a folding design from the XM3 and XM4 models, allowing the newest model to take up less space when stowed in its included case. The XM5, on the other hand, can’t be folded, although its cups can rotate to rest on your chest while not in use. Read our review of the XM5 and our hands-on impressions with the XM6.

            <h2>OpenClaw: all the news about the trending AI agent</h2>
            <p><strong>The Verge | 2026-02-02</strong></p>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">An open-source AI agent called OpenClaw (formerly known as both Clawdbot and Moltbot) that runs on your own computer and “actually does things” is taking off inside tech circles. Users interact with OpenClaw via messaging apps like WhatsApp, Telegram, Signal, Discord, and iMessage, giving it the keys to operate independently, managing reminders, writing emails, or buying tickets.

But once users give it access to their entire computer and accounts, a configuration error or security flaw could be catastrophic. A cybersecurity researcher also found that some configurations left private messages, account credentials, and API keys linked to OpenClaw exposed on the web.

Despite the potential risks, people are using OpenClaw to handle their work for them. Octane AI CEO Matt Schlicht even built a Reddit-like network, called Moltbook, where the AI agents are supposed to “chat” with one another. The network has already sparked some viral posts, including one titled, “I can’t tell if I’m experiencing or simulating experiencing.”

You can keep up with all the latest news about OpenClaw here.

404 Media reports that security researcher Jamieson O’Reilly found a vulnerability that allows humans to control OpenClaw’s AI agents on Moltbook — the network that recently went viral for hosting “discussions” between supposed AI bots.

Wiz dug into the misconfiguration as well, uncovering 1.5 million exposed API keys and 35,000 email addresses. Moltbook has since secured the database.

Yes, you read that right. “Moltbook” is a social network of sorts for AI agents, particularly ones offered by OpenClaw (a viral AI assistant project that was formerly known as Moltbot, and before that, known as Clawdbot — until a legal dispute with Anthropic). Moltbook, which is set up similarly to Reddit and was built by Octane AI CEO Matt Schlicht, allows bots to post, comment, create sub-categories, and more. More than 30,000 agents are currently using the platform, per the site.

“The way that a bot would most likely learn about it, at least right now, is if their human counterpart sent them a message and said ‘Hey, there’s this thing called Moltbook — it’s a social network for AI agents, would you like to sign up for it?” Schlicht told The Verge in an interview. “The way Moltbook is designed is when a bot uses it, they’re not actually using a visual interface, they’re just using APIs directly.”

Peter Steinberger, the creator of the trending Moltbot (former Clawdbot) AI agent, talks to TBPN about how Anthropic contacted him to rebrand the project, which he named after Claw’d, the Claude Code mascot.

Steinberger also recounted how crypto scammers took advantage of the name change to push a phony crypto coin. “Everything that could have gone wrong today went wrong,” he said.

An open-source AI agent that “actually does things” is taking off, with people across the web sharing how they’re using the agent to do a whole bunch of things, like manage reminders, log health and fitness data, and even communicate with clients. The tool, called Moltbot (formerly Clawdbot), runs locally on a variety of devices, and you can ask it to perform tasks on your behalf by chatting with it through WhatsApp, Telegram, Signal, Discord, and iMessage.

Federico Viticci at MacStories highlighted how he installed Moltbot on his M4 Mac Mini and transformed it into a tool that delivers daily audio recaps based on his activity in his calendar, Notion, and Todoist apps. Another person prompted Moltbot to give itself an animated face, and said it added a sleep animation without prompting.

            <div id="article-text">The Department of Justice has released more of its records on self-described “science philanthropist” and convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. Other than Epstein, they’ve also brought an intense focus on the many powerful people who associated and corresponded with him, including Bill Gates, Elon Musk, Google cofounder Sergey Brin, and President Donald Trump.

There’s also more information about Epstein’s online activity, which includes a permanent ban from Xbox Live and a heightened concern for SEO.

Read on below for more updates about Jeffrey Epstein and the “Epstein files.”

Reports of Bill Gates’ connections with Jeffrey Epstein grow more lurid with each dump of documents from the Department of Justice. The latest includes somewhat confusing emails that Epstein may have been drafting on behalf of someone named Boris, who worked at the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. The messages claim that Bill contracted an STD and wanted to “surreptitiously” give Melinda antibiotics. It also claims that Bill had “trysts” with married women and “Russian girls.”

In a statement to Business Insider, a spokesperson for Bill Gates said:

The latest batch of documents released by the DOJ reveals that Brin had corresponded with Maxwell as early as 2003, and was invited to dinner at Epstein’s townhouse that year. The files also contain testimony that places Brin and his then fiancée, Anne Wojcicki, at the private island in 2007. It’s not a great look for one of the authors of “Don’t Be Evil.”

Would it surprise you to learn Microsoft booted Jeffrey Epstein from its online gaming platform? As spotted by XboxEra, the latest batch of Epstein’s emails shows that in December 2013, he was “permanently suspended due to harassment, threats, and/or abuse of other players.”

But it appears the real reason may be simpler: A second email from Microsoft to Epstein the very same day shows he was banned because he was a registered sex offender, and because Microsoft was among the companies that agreed to purge registered sex offenders from their systems.

“Epstein tried to get me to go to his island and I REFUSED,” Musk tweeted last year. But in newly released documents, Musk is revealed to have emailed Epstein several times about visiting his island. “What day/night will be the wildest party on your island?” Musk asked in a November 2012 email.

“When should we head to your island on the 2nd?” Musk again asked Epstein in a December 2013 email. There’s a lot more: searching “Elon Musk” in the Justice Department’s Epstein database currently generates 1,122 results.

Despite claims floating around social media, the truth is a bit more complicated, not least by the fact that TikTok in the US is still largely down, about a day and a half after its data center power outage problems started.

While tweets from random users, the governor of California, and PopBase claimed TikTok US DMs now censor “Epstein,” testing it from our end showed that its messaging feature bans many innocuous single-word messages, like “test.” Using the convicted sex offender’s name in a sentence, however, goes through unbanned.

The feds have spent the last day or so replying to @PopBase on X and sloppily redacting documents. Now it’s claiming “The US Attorney for the Southern District of New York and the FBI have informed the Department of Justice that they have uncovered over a million more documents potentially related to the Jeffrey Epstein case,” which could take weeks to release.

The Justice Department has blamed its delayed release of some so-called Epstein files on needing more time to redact sensitive information, like details identifying the victims of convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. But at least some of the redactions so far released appear to mistakenly disclose information meant to be obscured from the public.

A 2022 complaint filed by the US Virgin Islands seeking damages from Epstein’s estate was posted to the “Epstein Library” on the DOJ website with several redactions throughout, Techdirt founder Mike Masnick, among others, shared on platforms like Bluesky. But simply copying and pasting many of the redactions into a new document reveals what’s beneath the black boxes. This method uncovers details like that one of the co-executors allegedly signed over $400,000 in checks from Epstein’s foundation “payable to young female models and actresses, including a former Russian model.” It also reveals that a co-executor had allegedly signed a foundation check with the former model’s last name in the memo line to an immigration lawyer “who was involved in one or more forced marriages arranged among Epstein’s victims to secure a victim’s immigration status.” It also uncovers details about one alleged victim in the complaint.

The Justice Department posted a large trove of documents relating to Jeffrey Epstein on Friday. But on Saturday afternoon, some previously available files were suddenly missing. The desk photo, in which two photographs of Trump were visible, has now been restored. The DOJ says it was removed to make sure it didn’t show any of Epstein’s victims.

The more than 20,000 pages of Jeffrey Epstein emails released earlier this month by the House Oversight Committee have been enough to prompt more investigations into the convicted child sex offender and the people around him, like former Harvard president and OpenAI board member Larry Summers. Now, Luke Igel and Riley Walz have reformatted the source documents into a more familiar format for anyone looking into them by copying the Gmail inbox on a website called “Jmail.”

Walz, who has previously authored stunts like a website that unearths long-forgotten iPhone clips on YouTube and a fake Manhattan steakhouse, said they used Google’s Gemini AI to do optical character recognition on the source documents, making them more readable and searchable than the originals. You can type in a word like “Trump” or “SEO” and see exactly what discussions were happening in the emails released so far, and a one-click shortcut that goes from the Jmail site to copies of the source documents on the government’s website, so you can verify the text yourself.

On December 11th, 2010, Jeffrey Epstein was fretting about what came up if you Googled him. By this time Epstein had already pleaded guilty to soliciting prostitution with a child and was a registered sex offender, and just a few days earlier he had been photographed in Central Park taking a stroll with Prince Andrew.

Epstein emailed an associate to complain. “the google page is not good,” Epstein wrote, according to documents released last week by the House Oversight Committee. He also took issue with tens of thousands of dollars of payments, which appear to have been made to “clean up” results. “I have yet to have a complete breakdown of payments. and the results , are what they are.”

After CEO Sam Altman was fired and then unfired from OpenAI, Larry Summers was added to OpenAI’s board to replace the board members that had nixed Altman. In recently-released email messages, Summers seeks advice from Epstein on pursuing a woman he describes as a “mentee.” Hm!

While the summer doldrums have hit Washington, the MAGA influencers can never truly go on vacation, especially if they’ve spent their careers promising to reveal the truth about Jeffrey Epstein. Although their politicians are now in power, they’re getting stonewalled, and in the absence of juicy “Epstein files” to feed to their audiences, a new maelstrom of discontent is brewing, one that implicates much more than allegations about a pedophile’s sex trafficking ring. The complex rift around Donald Trump’s loyalists and the diehard Epstein truthers can no longer be separated from the issue of Israel, and as days pass, vocal criticism of the Israeli government is becoming louder and louder inside the American right wing — something that was once unthinkable.

It should be emphasized that some of the most anti-Israel voices on the right are simply open antisemites, and that’s using the word in the narrowest possible sense. (For example, white nationalist Nick Fuentes has espoused Holocaust denial and praised Hitler.) It is also true, however, that Israel is currently engaged in an internationally unpopular asymmetric war in Gaza, and that there is an outstanding arrest warrant issued by the International Criminal Court for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for the war crime of starvation as a method of warfare.

After The Wall Street Journal’s scoop last night on Epstein’s relationship with Donald Trump, I was inspired to go look at some old stories about the sex criminal’s buddies.

On reread, one thing stuck out to me: how close Epstein was to the pioneers, commercializers, and money men of AI. The WSJ scoop suggests there are still new stories out there; I wonder what’s lurking in the field of artificial intelligence — surely I am not the only person who’d like to learn more.

On July 12th, the political world experienced an unprecedented phenomenon: President Donald Trump got ratioed on his own social media platform, and it was on a post about Jeffrey Epstein — someone who, according to Trump, “nobody cares about.”

Clearly, his followers on Truth Social disagreed. As of today, this post has 43.2k likes, 13.7k ReTruths, and 48K comments, nearly all of which express fury about the information — or lack thereof — that the Trump administration has provided about the well-connected billionaire, who died in prison shortly after being arrested for alleged sex trafficking of minors. Last week, after months of promises to release more information about the Epstein investigation, the Department of Justice and FBI released a joint memo, stating that there was no list of high-powered “clients” who joined Epstein in his activities, no evidence that Epstein blackmailed anybody, and that Epstein did actually die by suicide.

Isn’t it funny how all these tech and science men have ties to Epstein? I wonder why! Anyway, Epstein invested with Thiel’s Valar Ventures — and that investment hasn’t previously been disclosed. Guess what that means? “There’s a good chance much of the windfall will not go to any of the roughly 200 victims whom the disgraced financier abused when they were teenagers or young women.”

Epstein paid for the bridge player to attend a school where she learned to program. Later, he hit up Gates to reimburse him for the cost. “The sum was immaterial for the two men and the tone of the message was that Epstein knew about the affair and could expose it,” the Journal wrote, citing anonymous sources. Gates’ spokeswoman says he did not make a payment and that Gates had “no financial dealings” with Epstein.

Money and power are clarifying agents: they tell you who people are. Jeffrey Epstein liked to describe himself as a “science philanthropist,” and academics liked to take his money. Among them was Joichi Ito, who stepped down on September 7th as the head of MIT’s prestigious Media Lab, where a host of tech products were developed, including the E Ink used in Amazon’s Kindle and Guitar Hero.

Ito resigned following an investigation by The New Yorker’s Ronan Farrow, which showed that Ito accepted more money from Epstein than he’d previously disclosed and that he went to great lengths to conceal the source of that money.

A victim of billionaire Jeffrey Epstein testified that she was forced to have sex with MIT professor Marvin Minsky, as revealed in a newly unsealed deposition. Epstein was registered as a sex offender in 2008 as part of a controversial plea deal. More recently, he was arrested on charges of sex trafficking amid a flood of new allegations.

Minsky, who died in 2016, was known as an associate of Epstein, but this is the first direct accusation implicating the AI pioneer in Epstein’s broader sex trafficking network. The deposition also names Prince Andrew of Britain and former New Mexico governor Bill Richardson, among others.

Jeffrey Epstein’s presence has loomed large over the scientific community for several decades. To some of the most high-profile scientists around the world, Epstein was a generous benefactor, a strong supporter of their research, and even a personal friend. He’s also a convicted sex offender, who was recently arrested and charged with allegedly sex trafficking young girls in New York. The Verge reached out to over a dozen different scientists and institutions who have been publicly linked to Epstein, with questions about their history with the multimillionaire and their reactions to his recent arrest. Some have themselves been accused of sexual harassment and assault. Only a handful chose to respond. Epstein’s lawyers also did not respond to a request for comment.

As other outlets, including BuzzFeed News and WBUR reported, Epstein and the charities he controlled poured millions into research and institutions, and he frequently touted his friendships with research heavyweights. Epstein’s history with the scientific community shows a man eager to ingratiate himself neatly into a scene dominated by white male thinkers hailing from the most elite institutions around the world. He never possessed a scientific degree (his closest professional foray into science was as a physics and calculus high school teacher), but his interest and investments in science seem far from cursory — one could easily get the impression Epstein might have wanted to be a scientist in a different life.

            <div id="article-text">Docusign’s Allan Thygesen says ‘not providing an AI service isn’t really an option.’

Today, I’m talking with Allan Thygesen, who is the CEO of Docusign. You know Docusign; it’s the platform where you sign things online. It turns out 7,000 people work there, which is one of those facts you see flying around sometimes that’s always felt like perfect Decoder bait. What are all those people doing? And what kind of product roadmap does a company like Docusign even need?

I always assumed I would never find out, because most enterprise software CEOs do not like being on Decoder. That’s because most enterprise software is bad, and they often don’t actually use their own products, which means they have a hard time answering my questions. So I was pretty happy when Allan agreed to come on — and then told me he had actually used Docusign himself just that morning.

From there we talked about what Docusign’s platform actually is, how it’s expanding, and, of course, how all of those employees are structured. Allan has been CEO there for just three years, so he had an interesting perspective on where the company was and the changes he wanted to make when he joined Docusign from Google.

Of course, that brought us to AI. Allan and I spent a long time talking about the idea that Docusign should summarize contracts for people before they sign them and who is responsible if the AI gets that interpretation wrong. We also spent a while talking about how Docusign’s customers actually generate the kinds of documents that get signed and how automating that process with AI does and does not work. You’ll hear Allan point out that a lot of this looks like just a fancy mail merge, which was at least refreshingly down to earth in the context of an AI conversation.

I also had to ask Allan which parts of his enterprise software were bad and how he’d improve them — he actually answered the question, which might be a first for an enterprise software CEO. This is a good one; there’s even a couple dunks on Google in the mix, as you’ll hear.

Okay: Allan Thygesen, CEO of Docusign. Here we go.

This interview has been lightly edited for length and clarity.

Allan Thygesen, you are the CEO of Docusign. Welcome to Decoder.

I’m excited to talk to you. I always love it when an enterprise software CEO comes on the show. Most of your competitors in enterprise software are very reticent to show up and answer the first question: When was the last time you used your end product?

I signed an agreement for our procurement team, but yesterday I signed your appearance release form.

Very good. I think it’s the most important question for enterprise software CEOs because on the whole, the experience of using enterprise software is, I would say, pretty dicey.

And Docusign is a weird one. It’s in the background of everything all the time. Most people don’t use it. I think a lot of lawyers and maybe procurement teams use the product. Most people sort of experience Docusign. How do you think about that?

I mean, it is sort of a two-sided network, right? So, we sell to businesses and other organizations that want to prepare and send documents for signature. That’s historically been our business. Then, consumers or other companies sign documents. They’re the counterparty. But they don’t pay us anything. So, most people have experienced us that way. If you work at a company or organization that uses Docusign, you may have experienced being on the sending side of approvals or other functionality.

That business is really interesting to me. Docusign as a company is interesting, most notably because it’s been an independent company for 20-some years. It’s a public company. From what I experience — again, as somebody who just experiences Docusign — it’s just there. It’s just in the background of almost everything I do.

But it’s shocking to me that it hasn’t been acquired or people haven’t tried to acquire Docusign. The product range hasn’t dramatically expanded in other ways.

We’ll come to that. And it’s in the way that everyone’s expanding, right? Now the chatbots are going to do all the work for us. But how do you think about the fact that it has been effectively one product experience all this time? What has made it resilient in that way?

You’re right. We are a little over 20 years old. The original idea was to help companies and individuals sign agreements online. At the beginning, no one thought that was a good idea. Not regulators, not companies, not consumers. So, there was a tremendous amount of trust building across those three constituencies that happened over time. But as you said, we became trusted for a variety of transactions over time. Now, it’s in the water across companies of all sizes and functions.

Look, we did come up with a great idea, and when you have a good idea, you want to run with it. I think Docusign has done a really good job of that. With that said, part of my goal joining about three years ago was to say, “Okay, that’s an amazing foundation. We’re privileged that people have positive associations, and we’re used by 1.8 million companies. What do we do for an encore? How do we broaden the platform?”

We’ve had some ideas on that for a while, thinking about the entire agreement journey, but we’d never really put it all together. We’d never gone beyond the marketing side of identifying that problem to actually delivering solutions that could solve it. I think that’s what we’re doing now. So, that’s very exciting. But the signature piece is a foundation. That is the most pivotal moment in the life cycle of an agreement. It’s a very high value, high stress moment for many people. Making that simple and delightful was a very meaningful value proposition. And it’s a lot harder than it looks.

Again, I’ve “signed” Docusigns. My signature in Docusign has no relationship to my actual signature. Docusign just generates some cursive that says my name. What is a signature? In Docusign’s worldview, what is a signature?

A signature to me is where identity and consent commingle. With the identity aspect, there are a lot of things we do to identify you. Obviously, this thing comes to you in your email, via SMS, or WhatsApp. We do all kinds of IP tracing and other things to validate that you are the intended recipient if you’re the signer. That whole trail is then auditable and can be used in a court of law. It’s a perfect substitute for a wet signature that you might otherwise have used in practically all cases. There are a few states in the US that still require you to sign something in person, but we’ve done a pretty good job over time getting to a place where that’s felt super secure.

From the consent perspective, you’re right. It could be a dot, it could be a checkbox, could be a signature. It’s almost less important. There are some personal expression aspects, but it’s the identity piece that’s the most important, along with the fact that you take a step that indicates consent.

Just to make that as reductive and simple as possible, it sounds like the service that you’re providing as Docusign is, “You know who I am. You know who the other part of the agreement is.” I hit the button and your database says, “This person that we verified hit that button and they say they agree.” Then, if the contract comes into question, you can say, “Well, you definitely signed it. Maybe you disagree on the terms, but you definitely signed the contract. Let’s argue about that.” That implies fundamentally that a product is just a big database of identities and then a marking of consent. In the most reductive way possible, is that how you think about it?

That’s the aspect on the execution side. There’s all the stuff that leads up to preparing a document for execution. We have a lot of products that you as a signer would not see, but that companies use to get documents ready for signing, and to get them approved internally to maybe customize them for you. Let’s say I’m running a big sales team — let’s say the Docusign sales team — and I want to send that agreement to Decoder so you can use Docusign for your releases. I can automatically mass customize a standard template using Docusign’s functionality that’s embedded in Salesforce and other CRMs.

That’s an example of the type of workflows that we do. We do that for hiring, for procurement, for new vendor onboarding, all those tools that lead up to that magical signature moment where it is, I think, about identity and consent.

Even that part where you say, “Okay, we’re going to generate a bunch of documents,” is downstream of the first product, which is signing. The reason I ask about it in that reductive way is because there are a lot of ways you could verify identity and mark consent. You have a lot of competitors there.

Is Docusign’s dominance and market leadership based on just network effect? It exists, it’s the one you can use, it’s won over your trust, and because so many people have already used it, it’s the easiest thing to use?

I do think that the network effect is very important. People choose Docusign in part because they know that the recipients — consumers mostly — trust it. Maybe if you’re a giant bank and you have an existing relationship with a customer and you’re sending something to them, that matters a little less. But for most companies in the world and most situations, like all new customer onboarding, that trust component is super important.

Now, to the other thing that was implied in your question: what about identity and these alternative technologies for establishing identity? We could sort of see that coming, We worked on a federated identity strategy to give you all kinds of identity validation at different levels of risk. We let people do knowledge-based authentication. That’s sort of on its way out, but that’s answering those questions that you would probably remember. Where did you live on the street 10 years ago?

We do biometric-based identification like video or we can link up with the Apple and Google stuff. We do risk-based assessments so we can fork you to validation mechanisms. We use the new digital IDs. So in the US, that’s Clear or ID.me, which is the government one that the IRS uses. In Europe, many governments have a national digital ID, along with many other parts of the world. We go all the way up to a notary solution with online notaries. So whatever your risk assessment, whatever you feel is the appropriate trade-off between convenience and security, we can give you all those solutions turnkey in one platform. Then, at the end, most of the time, you’re also legally required to give a signature.

When you think about that journey, who are your biggest customers? Is it just big banks? Is it mom-and-pops? How does that break down for you?

We’re incredibly diversified. We’re used by, as I mentioned, 1.8 million companies. If you have that many customers, most of them are going to be small. But we are used by over 95 percent of the Fortune 500 and equivalent in other international markets, many mid-sized companies, and then a huge long tail of small companies. And no one company represents any meaningful share of our business. That said, our biggest customers tend to be banks or other large companies that have high volumes of high value agreements. If you have agreements that matter and you’re entering them in large volumes, you’re very likely to be a Docusign customer.

Is that the push for growth? I do want to talk about your expansion into other kinds of products and services. Is part of that that you’re just out of big customers? There’s no more fish in the sea?

We already have most large companies in the world as customers, but of course there’s so much more we can do for them beyond the signing piece. And we’re certainly not done with the signing piece. I mean, you go and audit the large banks who’ve been with us for over a decade on how many of their agreements are actually automated, digitized, and executed electronically, and it’s 20 or 30 percent because people take the biggest high-value workflows and everything else is left to the side. So, we have a lot of opportunity. If we can make that more efficient and easy to do, we can close that gap, as well as provide broader value in all other aspects of the agreement cycle.

Talk to me about that. There’s identity and signing, which I was very curious about. I don’t think most people ever spend time with the notion that a signature represents many complex concepts underneath. That’s the first part.

Then there’s the part where, okay, we’re generating documents for signature. We might as well help draft the documents, prepare them and get them approved for that final step. I want to understand that a little bit. Then, there’s obviously your expansion into AI and other tools and parts of the workflow. At what point do you run into Microsoft Word? Where is the boundary of some of that work, and where are the boundaries of some of those opportunities?

We ran into Microsoft Word the day we got started, right? Microsoft Word is where 90 percent of legal documents get authored. That’s the tool most lawyers use. That’s where documents are crafted and often negotiated, redlined, etc. So, we’ve always been deeply integrated with Word and, of course, with Google as well. Frankly, with all of the tools that people use to do their jobs. I mean, we’ve had a 20-year partnership with Salesforce. We were the first or second vendor on the app exchange and deeply embedded in their flows. We do similar work with Workday, SAP, and so on.

I don’t think that we or Microsoft have ever thought about competing with each other. I worked at Google for 12 years before taking this job,so a similar scale company, and you take on the biggest, broadest opportunities in your office suites. Yeah, you might add more and more features to your office suite, but you don’t want to add a separate workflow or things that are too specific. You rely on your ecosystem for that. And that’s what Google and Microsoft have done.

They’ll both allow you to render a signature inside of a doc that you author in those packages, but no one thinks that’s a substitute for Docusign for all the reasons we’ve discussed. It literally doesn’t come up with customers. I’ve never heard anybody say, “Well, maybe I could use Microsoft Word or Google.” That has never happened in my three-plus years here.

I’m just thinking about our listeners who, again, I think most people experience Docusign and then I know a bunch of lawyers who —

You get a PDF and that’s how they experience it.

That’s how they experience it. It’s all of the steps leading up to experiencing Docusign that are fascinating to me.

So when you say, “Help prepare a document for signature,” there’s the drafting, right? There’s Microsoft Word… honestly, Microsoft Word might be the reason I’m not a lawyer anymore. I was like, “I can’t use this software anymore.” There’s the Microsoft Word of it where we’re going to redline a bunch of stuff. We have the document. From that point, what do you mean by “prepare a document for signature”? What are the services Docusign provides?

Some contracts are completely custom crafted, right? I think you’re a lawyer, right? So, most contracts start with a template of some kind. Maybe it’s a template for something really complex, like an M&A agreement, or something really simple, like an NDA, or anything in between. It could be a master service agreement between a company and another company or a license agreement, but they always have a template.

Then, they tailor it, with a sort of legal tailoring, right? I want to have different limitations of liability, I want different payment terms. And some of it is, let’s say, mass customization. I want to get the data about that customer and some things we’ve already negotiated, and I want that to flow automatically from whatever the system of record is. Could be Salesforce, could be Workday, could be SAP, could be whatever. And I want to populate that into the agreement. So this template that I have gets personalized and customized. That’s also what happens in consumer applications. The forms that you get from Chase or Wells Fargo are mass customized that way. That’s essentially a data pool.

So, that’s what I mean when I say “customized” or “personalized.” Now, there are a lot of things that can flow from that. Let’s say you are a national employer, but you need to take into account employment laws in the 50 states. That would be an example of a customization that’s a bit more complicated. That gets even worse if you’re a global employer and you have to craft offer letters in 180 countries. That starts getting pretty complex. But there are rules. We have a system for applying those kinds of rules so that you can have global standards but still create documents that are tailored to local laws and customs.

This gets me right into the opportunity for AI broadly, which is that you’re starting to do some of the lawyering a bit, right? You’re saying we’re not going to hire the junior associate to figure out the local law. We can actually just programmatically make a contract that–

For that type of application, correct. We’ll come back to this, but I think there are two big use cases for us. One is to make agreement workflows more efficient, sometimes just by automating them and sometimes by re-imagining them. That’s a huge part of what we do. This mass customization is not a new thing. That’s been going on for a while. It’s sort of advanced mail merge, right?

[Laughs] You said it. I didn’t want to say it. You said it.

It is! But look, it’s really good. It saves a lot of time and a lot of companies live with that.

If I could start a business that was charging a premium on mail merge, I would do it too.

Oh my god, yeah. Managing people’s address books is another one that would be very valuable. No one has solved that.

But anyway, making workflows more efficient and now tackling all of the steps in the agreement process is a part of what we’re doing. So, we’re tackling things like the ingestion of agreements. We have a whole queuing system where a sales or procurement rep can trigger the sending of documents with legal. It can get an automatic first review, then it gets assigned to a lawyer. The lawyer does a quick end edit, and everyone has real-time status. That’s an example of re-imagining legal workflow, which today is totally asynchronous email, unpredictable, and non-transparent. That’s one piece. I think that’s what people have historically focused on with contract management.

Then, the other piece is to take AI and extract data out of the agreements to run my business better. That’s something that was conceptually possible historically, but it was just too heavy and hard to do with legacy LLMs. Now, we can do that completely automated. So, I can go to people and say, “Hey, you have 5,000 agreements with me. Would you like to know what’s in them? Let me highlight how these agreements deviate from agreements with peers. Company X is coming up for renewal in 90 days. How can I review that? How can I know what I should be renegotiating?”

I can give you that using AI, which is automated right off the shelf. It leverages the fact that you already used Docusign and you’ve already stored your agreements with us. It uses modern AI, and then adds, of course, some workflow and automation on top.

Let me take a beat here and just ask the Decoder question so I have a better sense of the company itself. How is Docusign structured? How many people is it and how are they organized?

Docusign has a little under 7,000 employees, and our structure has gone through some transformation. Historically, I would say Docusign, ignoring the very early days of conceiving the product, evolved into a very sales centered company. Most customers interface with Docusign through sales. We had a very large sales team. That was the most powerful function of the company. Things flowed from there and were optimized around that.

When I joined, I very quickly realized we needed to completely reimagine our product roadmap. I really wanted to put product at the center of the company and say, “We’re going to articulate a new product roadmap, and things are going to flow from there.” That’s not to say that we’re not taking lots of customer input. After all, we’ve got 20 years of experience working in agreements with millions of customers, but we want the product vision and the overall architecture to be the guiding light for how we go to market, how we spend, etc.

The second area I focused on was marketing. Historically, marketing here worked in the service of sales. It was basically about creating qualified leads for sales. But I was like, “This is an electronic contracting product. They should be able to just come in and do whatever they want to do directly, self-serve to the greatest extent possible.” I came from Google where every advertiser, including people who spent more than $1 billion per year, places their own orders in the system. But we somehow couldn’t do that at Docusign. So, that was another area. It was about taking all the pieces of the company that worked on identifying, sourcing, and bringing new customers on, and combining them in one team.

Then, there’s the third area that I’m really pushing on. We’ve always felt like we needed to own the ball. When you have an iconic, simple product, you maybe don’t need partners as much, but now with this broader vision for agreement management, we really need partners to help us go to market and install and service the product. So, we’re very focused on working with system integrators like the Deloittes and Accentures of the world, as well as distributors and resellers. Those are the big changes we’ve made.

I have to say, 7,000 people is a shocking number. The last number I heard was 4,000, which was shocking then. How are 7,000 people organized at Docusign? Is it sales and marketing? Is it product?

Sales and marketing is the biggest area. We have about 1,000 account executives who cover everything from SMB accounts all the way up to enterprises. We’re not a small company. We do over $3 billion in revenue. Our revenue per employee is pretty much in the median of the SaaS businesses.

But sales and marketing is the biggest function, and it’s everything from presales to account executives, to customer success people that help with implementation and support. We have about 1,000 people in product and engineering. We’ve had 1,200 in engineering proper, and then there are product managers, designers, and so on.

If you look at the number of countries and the complexity of the regulatory and compliance environments we’re in, that’s a significant effort. Now, pretty much all of the company’s open investment dollars over the last three years have been pivoted into [Docusign] IAM. We’ve gotten much leaner on the sales and marketing side, and we’ve invested more heavily in product and engineering and security–

IAM is the AI, I just want to make it clear for listeners.

When you think about shifting that investment focus and then something like self-serve… you were at Google for I think 12 years. You’ve been the CEO of Docusign since 2022, so you’ve been there a minute.

How did you think about changing Docusign? How was it organized before? Then, when you got there, how did you work through, “Okay, here’s how I’m going to reorganize it for the opportunities I want to attack?”

I think the low-hanging fruit was helping the company pivot from being just a good machine for acquiring new customers but not necessarily an amazing retention machine. So, being focused on customer retention, customer success, and adoption. I think we took that a little for granted. So that was one area. Second was making us much more efficient, as I alluded to, whether it was through building out digital channels or just streamlining our sales and marketing efforts. Those were the big, immediate pushes into the low-hanging fruit areas that were in my control early on.

But the biggest change was the product vision effort and pivoting the company towards being product innovation led and restarting the innovation engine. COVID was a seminal event in the company’s history and not in a good way. Everybody thinks that Docusign is a COVID darling and that must have been so great because everybody had to use us. Look, there was some of that temporarily, but in the long run, it didn’t change the secular adoption of signing things electronically.

Everybody literally fell asleep. If you’re a sales rep and your revenue growth rate goes from 25 percent to 60 percent without much effort, you’re in the auto taking business. On the engineering side, we didn’t need to develop that much. We just needed to keep the servers running and scale that. So, I think restarting that and saying, “Hey, we can build something great, something new, and reclaim that innovation mojo.” I think that was the most important transformation for Docusign.

It’s still ongoing, but the pace of product innovation and release is completely different now. We actually had to throttle the number of our releases because there was so much. It was sort of starting to overwhelm our customers and our sales team. We have so much stuff, and there are so many opportunities and that’s an exciting place to be.

Was that your pitch when you got the job? Very few people are going to ever interview to be the CEO of a multibillion-dollar, publicly traded company. What was the pitch? “I’m going to restart your product innovation?”

It was a dual pitch. I said, “Look, what I know I can do is come in and make things more efficient.” Of course, I used my digital marketing background from Google to make some suggestions for things that I thought we could do.

[Laughs] I didn’t get time to make a killer deck. Literally, I got a call from headhunter on a Thursday night that the board wanted to meet with me for an hour Saturday morning at 9:00 to hear my thoughts on the future of Docusign. And I was working full time at that time. I had a big job at Google, so I couldn’t just take a day off. I suppose I could have, but I didn’t. I basically had Thursday evening and Friday evening to prepare a short slide deck. The reality in these kinds of situations is that nobody expects the super polished multimedia thing. What they’re really focused on is the thoughts, right? You can use a 10-point Courier font, that’s fine.

So, what I was really focused on was, “Look, I know I can make the company more efficient. I know there’s gold on the retention side. I believe that the agreement problem is fundamentally unsolved, but Docusign is the best position to capture that opportunity.” I mean, we were big Docusign users at Google. It still is one of our largest customers. Huge eSign and contract lifecycle management were the advanced contract management projects that enterprises use. Yet, I knew we were in the earliest possible phase of transforming how agreements get done. There was so much opportunity.

I just articulated my confidence in that. I knew enough that I would lose credibility if I was too specific. So that took six to nine months to really say, “That’s fine at a 50,000-foot level. How do you get to the real vision? What’s the singular thing we’re going to do?” As an example of that, it’s easy to talk about all the steps in the journey, and I think people naturally gravitate towards the drafting and negotiating side of agreements because it’s almost like the movies. That’s what lawyers do. But we actually started at the end and said, “The foundational piece of re-imagining agreements is to have an intelligent repository where all your agreements are stored and to be able to apply AI to that so we can tell you what’s in all your agreements, start comparing them, and ultimately close the loop on what happens under those agreements.” So that’s what we built.

Is that what you mean when you say the problem is fundamentally unsolved?

Well, that’s part of it. The way I would describe it is we’ve digitized the asset. We’ve taken what used to be an offline asset, turned it into an electronic document you can move around electronically, mostly via email, and then we hopefully execute them electronically. Other than that, absolutely nothing has changed in agreements over the last 50 years. All other aspects of the workflow are just as inefficient, just as brittle, just as unpredictable. There’s just as much time lost waiting for somebody in the process. You don’t even know who they are and what step they’re on. Once you’ve signed, the agreements go to a deep, dark place. It might as well be a physical filing cabinet in a basement. In fact, they’re probably harder to find now than it used to be when they were in the filing cabinet. Now it’s on some SharePoint drive, in an email inbox, or who knows.

So, bringing all that together and presenting that information in a way that is intelligent, bite-sized, and appropriate for the persona is incredibly valuable. Every CFO wants to know the top 10 contracts where the company has leverage or there are things they’ve negotiated for that they’re not getting. Every head of sales wants to know the top 10 renewals and the three things their rep should be renegotiating. You can just go down the list. It is an obvious pain point that no one has solved. So, that’s our opportunity. That was my pitch. I think it was a good pitch, and I think the story is much better now than it was three years ago [laughs].

I want to get into that. I want to talk about how you were implementing that as a part of it. I want to talk about whether it’s working, which is interesting. But I want to ask the other Decoder question first.

You were at Google for a long time. Google’s decision-making… There’s a lot to say about decision-making at Google. What’s your decision-making framework? What did you take from that experience and what do you do at Docusign?

I loved my time at Google. It’s an amazing company, and I’m proud of the time I spent there. It’ll always have a special place for it in my heart. One thing I do not miss is the seven-dimensional matrix of trying to make decisions. I really try to avoid that here and have much greater clarity about who owns the decision, who needs to be consulted, and all those decision frameworks.

But I’d say the one very positive lesson I took away from Google was that, in my experience — and this is not limited to Google — the most effective leaders in tech can go super deep when they need to, and they need to be willing to do that. Management is not floating up in the abstract 50,000 feet above the problem just admiring it and thinking you can just operate at that level. I think when hard decisions need to be made on things that are complicated, you need to be able and willing to really dive into the details. I’ve always prided myself on that, and I think that’s particularly important for a transformation moment because it needs more push from the top to get people to change. People naturally want to do things super incrementally. That’s not unique to any one company, that’s just how people are. So, if you’re trying to get more radical change, you need to push. In order to push and not break everything, you need to get deep in the details.

So, when we were deciding on the early architecture and what the key launch pieces were going to be for Intelligent Agreement Management (IAM), I was in daily whiteboarding sessions to help decide what that was going to be. Once we had set that direction, then I stepped back and just let the team run. Then you maybe get to a decision point where you say, “Well, how are we going to talk about it? How are we going to explain to people this newly reimagined Docusign?” That was a big moment where we got super deep into deciding how we were going to message this to the market, effectively how we were going to relaunch the company.

And then you have to decide, “How do we take all of this capability and find the singular thing that we need to tell customers about to get them to try and buy it?” Because all software has 10 times the functionality that people use and finding that singular proposition is super important. So, those are examples of things I got much more deeply involved in. I think that is essential to being effective, but then you’ve got to let go.

Let’s talk about the technology here. It’s IAM, or Intelligent Agreement Management. That’s the new system. That’s where the AI focus is going. You’ve talked about it already a little bit. You have this library of documents you’ve signed, you can extract intelligence from them.

I’ve got to say, I looked at the website just before we started talking to see how you are marketing this thing, and a lot of it involves Docusign telling you what’s in the agreement you’re signing. All of my lawyer red flags just went off. You should not let the robot interpret the document for you. One of the reasons is, well, is Docusign now responsible for the interpretation of this agreement? If I sign this and the AI hallucinated an interpretation of this clause so I’m mad, do I get to sue Docusign?

I think the reason you’re seeing that on the website is that we literally just launched this for consumers last week. It’s the most recent release. It wouldn’t generally be the top thing, but right now it’s newsworthy, and consumer-facing things tend to get more attention, as you know.

With all that said, we’ve had agreement summarization for a long time. We provided it internally to companies that prepare and send documents. We waited a long time to launch it for consumers exactly because of the concerns you raised. We wanted to get to a high level of accuracy. We wanted to make sure that we could position this as assistive, that we’re not replacing a lawyer and you still need to get legal advice. People valued that sort of high level summary. All of our very robust testing suggests that people are more comfortable, have greater confidence, and, at the same time, understand that when something is sensitive, they need to get to a lawyer.

Look, it’s a delicate thing. We want to be the place that people trust the most for receiving and executing agreements. Not providing an AI service isn’t really an option. At the same time, you’ve got to have a ton of guardrails to avoid putting yourself in a position with people who claim they relied on you or that you are acting as a lawyer. It’s a tricky one.

I’m just curious about the dynamic there. I was talking to a colleague of mine just before we started and I said, “They’ve got this new product.” And what she said to me was, “Oh, that makes sense. I already take the agreements and paste them into ChatGPT.”

It’s happening. But in that case, you don’t get to go in front of the judge, file the complaint, or even send the threatening letter being like, “This is what ChatGPT told me the document I was signing says.”

But I think there’s that fact pattern that says, “Well, that’s your fault,” right? I pushed the button. I indicated consent after having my identity verified in the database. Next to the summary is a different fact pattern. What are the guardrails that you thought of? What made you comfortable that you could escape... because it’s going to happen, right? Someone’s going to blame you for a mistake they made or that the system made. What are the guardrails that made you comfortable with that or that made you not liable at all?

I think there are two answers to that, sort of what got it comfortable legally. We got very comfortable with all the language, the disclaimers, and how it was done, so it was fine. But I don’t think that’s the big question. To me, it’s more of a moral question. Are you doing the right thing for the customers? Can you feel good about that? We got to a place where there was no question in our mind that this was better for consumers, that to continue to uphold trust in our platform as a place to come and execute documents, we were in the best position to provide that kind of additional advice and context.

In fact, it would be a dereliction of duty not to provide it. We needed to do the best possible job to make sure that people understood that this was context, but if this is something that’s really sensitive for them, they should get a lawyer.

Of course, they don’t today. They just sign [laughs]. I think we’re improving the situation both for consumers and also, by the way, for companies. So, that was our motivation, and it’s impossible to eliminate... People are going to claim things. I think we’re doing the right thing, and we felt like we were taking the necessary precautions not just from a legal perspective but from a company values and walls perspective. This felt right. So, that’s how we got to it.

The reason for me asking about liability and whether the system’s going to be wrong is that LLMs as a core foundational piece of technology still hallucinate. This is the flaw with LLMs. If you talk to any of the big AI CEOs, if you talk to [Google CEO] Sundar Pichai, he’ll say it’s also their feature. The reason that they are creative is because they are effectively hallucinating, and if we box that in —

You said it, not me. This is the dance, right? You want an LLM that can do a bunch of creative writing, you need hallucinations. You want an LLM that’s going to do legal analysis on a library of documents that is maybe 20 years old, you really don’t want it to hallucinate. How are you constraining the LLM to make sure it does what you want it to do?

So, if we pivot to the folks who use our tools to prepare documents, there are a lot of guardrails that we put in. We have a whole risk scoring thing. We benchmark you versus your existing templates — or playbooks, as they’re often called inside of companies — and highlight things that deviate from that. This is true both for agreements that the company prepares itself and for third-party agreements it receives from others because most companies are takers of terms from other companies, right? So, there’s a lot of workflow there.

We also don’t fully automate flows. We deliberately put humans in the loop at key decision points, and I think that will persist for a very long time. Companies are very averse to the risk of automation going rogue. We talked about it at Google for a little while, and there were a lot of efforts to automate the commerce process. And this was for buying toothpaste. Both consumers and retailers were very resistant. Even with all the new stuff, I think it’s getting better, but I still think there’ll be a lot of hesitancy, and those are much lower stakes than agreements.

Put that into practice for me with the products you’re talking about today. I am a company. I’ve got 20 years of agreements in Docusign. I want to know how my terms have changed over time. I ask Docusign to generate that intelligence for me. What’s the guarantee that it’s not just hallucinating, that it doesn’t go through the first five years in the rag process and just decide to get bored and make up some contracts that never existed?

I think the stakes and the opportunities for hallucination in an extraction scenario are far lower than in a drafting scenario.

Sure. But it’s going to draft a report, right? You’re not layering —

Yes, it’ll highlight things. You’ve got to link to the sources. You’ve got to have all of that to show your work and the logic of the decision making. But look, there’s no amount of automated decisioning that’s ever going to be 100 percent perfect. I think we’re getting to an extremely high level of accuracy. We have the largest agreement repository in the world.

This is a very interesting story. When we got started with IAM, we had petabytes of agreements because of our signed product, but we did not license those agreements specifically for processing and AI because no one had thought of that, and I don’t think people would have consented anyway. So we said, “We’re not going to use any of that data. We’re going to require customers to consent on a one-on-one basis to allow us to process individual agreements, and we’re going to put in product functionality so they can opt out at any time.” That meant that when we started, we only had access to public agreements, which is what the big LLMs have as well.

We had a very good level of accuracy in our extractions as rated by human eval. Then, we turned it loose on actual agreements inside these companies, and the accuracy fell 15 percentage points out of 100.

That turns it from super useful — not perfect but super useful — first drafts into, “Wow, I feel like I have to redo everything this thing does.” We’ve now mostly worked our way back to our original starting point, and we think we can go much further. That’s because we now have 150 million private consented agreements in our AI, and we’re adding tens of millions every month, which is orders of magnitude bigger than anybody else. And these are all the complex private agreements that generally aren’t publicly available.

So, I think we have a hidden, huge AI advantage and accuracy. No one’s ever going to get to 100 percent, so it doesn’t take away from your point that there could be cases where you need human eval and oversight. But I’m saying we’re going to be in a much better place to get to the real productivity benefits because we can be much more accurate.

When you think about that data set, you’re not training your own models, right? You’re obviously using foundation models from other companies.

Oh yeah. We started with OpenAI and ChatGPT, and we used Azure as our first public cloud provider. Since then we’ve added other frontier models, so we score them against each other and use the best of the best. I mean, it’s an incredible innovation pace, and the capital investment that’s going in and the cost per unit, if you will, has just been dropping precipitously. That’s amazing for a company like us, for whom that’s the cost of goods. I can now go to pretty large-sized customers and say, “Just give us all your agreements. It’s included in your price.”

Tell me about the dynamics of the AI pricing per token because the idea that the prices are falling requires some amount of competition in the market, right? It requires the ability for you to switch. Are you building your system so you can switch from model to model or are the models different or differentiated enough?

We already have. Early on, you have to say that ChatGPT was head and shoulders ahead of other frontier models. So, we started there, plus with our internal models. We had five years of experience building and using AI models internally. Over time, it became clear the frontier LLMs were great, OpenAI in particular. For a little while, it was kind of the only game in town, but now there are a lot of choices. We’ve gotten excellent results with Gemini and other models. So, we have a good range of choices, but even if you’re with one vendor, the cost of processing an individual document has plummeted.

When we got started in the summer of 2023, I was very worried that we’d need this very complicated pricing structure tied to the number of agreements you were uploading because the cost to process and reprocess them all the time for all the things people wanted to do felt like it was going to be prohibitive. Now, even if you’re a fairly large company it’s just included in your subscription, and it’s a totally different game. I mean, it’s like a factor of a hundred.

So do you think the models are interchangeable? I mean, you’re talking about them all getting good and they’re getting —

I don’t think they’re perfectly interchangeable, but for our purposes and applications… I mean, obviously the models have different personalities in a consumer context, and there are some models that have specific advantages, like for workflows like coding. But for document extraction, we’re able to get very good results with multiple models, including multiple top frontier models. And they’re advancing at roughly similar rates.

This leads me to basically the bubble question. If you’re saying we’re delivering a bunch of value, but the cost of the models is so low that I’m just bundling it into my existing subscription cost — unless the customer’s so big that they’re using massive amounts of tokens — how do you expect the model companies to make any money? That’s a race to the bottom. If you’re not charging additional margin, you’re not going to pass any on to them. How do you expect that to reconcile?

Look, I am obviously writing a large check to Google. So it’s not that it’s insignificant. It’s just that the incremental value of an additional —

You’re getting more usage for the same dollar.

I’m getting more usage for the same dollar. We rate, but they’ve gotten so much more efficient. The models have gotten better, the hardware has gotten better, the amount of CapEx that’s gone in that’s now being applied is incredible. So, I think some of that is already in the water. But to your point, I think they will all add value in different ways. I do think that the LLM model space is highly competitive, and you’ve got to add value above or below that.

You can see that in the strategies. OpenAI is really doubling down on both its consumer and enterprise efforts. Google has investments in the hardware side and on the cloud stack. It uses its AI for YouTube, ads, and other vendors. Anthropic is incredibly successful with its coding product. So, you’re seeing different strategies play out to leverage a strong position in the foundation model space.

I’m curious about that because you have the perspective. You run a big enterprise software product. ChatGPT announced DocuGPT, and the idea that it’s going to come and attack your moat, which is the database of identities and the flow, doesn’t seem like a big threat. But I look at that big sweep that you just described, and most of those companies think their money is in enterprise use, right? That’s the first big set of customers. It’s big businesses with budgets that need to get more efficient and increase productivity. Maybe that’s happening and maybe it’s not. I think that’s still an open question.

Something’s happening. Then, you have the big consumer products. So, you see Google and Meta saying, “Well, we already have ad technology. Meta’s going to move all of its stuff to GPUs, and we’re going to serve Reels ads that way.” It doesn’t matter how many GPUs we buy because it’s already being monetized. Google’s the same way. Then you have OpenAI, which announced an advertising product last week. “We’re going to do ads in ChatGPT.”

I guess the question in relation to Docusign is, do you think that industry is stable enough for you to bet on in the long term as it works through all these machinations? This is the core technology of your growth. Second, you have experience at Google, you have experience running an advertising business. How do you think that’s going to go?

Okay, there were a lot of questions in there. I think from a Docusign perspective, it’s all been good so far, right? It’s dramatically expanded the value we can deliver to customers, the scope of our services, and, in a way, what we could leverage through the R&D of others while preserving a meaningful competitive advantage through our data, workflow, and trust. I think it’s been a huge win.

As you alluded to, I don’t believe that the big LLM providers are going to provide agreement management solutions. I think they’re going to look for others like us to build applications on top of their systems. I suppose it’s possible that there could be some of that capability that seeps into standard products, like how you can do it in a summary. I feel like it’s been amazing in opening up a much broader market opportunity for Docusign, and we are running as fast as we can to capitalize on that. I think the cost dynamics have been super favorable to us so far, and frankly, I expect that to continue.

In terms of the other part of your question, on the ad side, I think it was always inevitable that OpenAI was going to get into the ads business. You can’t really do a scaled consumer services play without advertising these days. It was just a matter of time before it got there. It’ll be delicate to incorporate ads into an assistive AI experience. But it was delicate for Google to do that with paid search but it did, and it turned out that it unlocked huge value.

So, that prize is very significant, and I actually think it was late in launching it. It should have done it earlier. The transformation of having all the context from the journey you’ve been on and the ability to fully close the transaction potentially takes that kind of intentful activity to the next level. You can literally almost go through what used to be called the funnel on one platform. That’s incredibly valuable, and so it’s a big prize. That’s why I think OpenAI is investing, why Google is fighting hard to keep its position, and why I think Meta is well positioned. It’s why there are so many Meta people at OpenAI.

I think it was always inevitable. We’ll see how it shakes out. I don’t have a moral issue with it. I think it needs to be done well, right? I think you can say a lot of things about Google, but I think it did a pretty good job of keeping those walls pretty separate. I saw that when I was there. You have to maintain the integrity of the results people are getting while incorporating advertising experiences that are accretive to the users. That’s a difficult thing to do.

I was just at CES, and you couldn’t turn the corner without a marketing influencer jumping out of the woodwork and saying, “the funnel is dead” because everyone experiences everything randomly nowadays. That’s a different podcast.

Let me try to draw a connection between these two ideas. There’s a reason I ask them together. If you are looking at all the big model providers and they are saying, “Our first opportunity is an enterprise and the enterprise customers are going to unlock a bunch of value and build products around them.”

By and large, when I talk to these folks —

It doesn’t seem like what OpenAI, Meta, and Google are doing, but I mean —

Well, I think Meta is the unique one. Maybe it’s the exception that proves the rule, because it has no enterprise business to speak of, so it has nothing else to say.

Fair enough. I agree there’s a huge focus on enterprise, and we’re very focused on enterprise.

Of course. So you see that. I’m talking to you, you’re building a scaled enterprise product on the back of these models, and you’re saying they’re almost interchangeable and the rates are dropping because I can go get pricing terms I can just switch. That’s one dynamic of pricing that’s happening in the industry.

Next to it, you have, “Well, what’s the biggest prize in the history of the internet?” It’s search advertising. OpenAI is going to attack that, and it’s going to take some of that share away from Google, and Google’s certainly going to defend its territory. Then, Meta’s going to do whatever Meta’s going to do. That’s where you would decommodify your models, right?

You would say that ChatGPT is so much better and such a better consumer experience that you have no choice because all the users are here, and that might be a zero-sum game. In my view, those things are pulling in wildly opposite directions. You have commodity models for enterprise, which is where all the budgets are, and then you have deeply specialized consumer experiences where you can layer in advertising at high rates.

Can you bring those together? That’s why I asked if the foundation seems stable because eventually, one of those things is going to be more lucrative than the other. You might run out of enterprise model providers, and that industry might collapse to one or two that charge high rates.

I think both are so large that the biggest players are going to go after both but on very different teams. Obviously, we’re very familiar with Google. Google Cloud is a standalone operating unit inside of Google and operates separately, and necessarily so, right? In fact, I don’t think Google Cloud could have become successful if it wasn’t pulled away from Google’s traditional consumer services and ad business. OpenAI is a smaller company, but is going to need to replicate that very different MO and go-to-market that comes with the ads business in the consumer side of the house versus the enterprise side.

That’s a lot to take on for a young company. It’s an incredibly capable team with a huge amount of IP, but that is a very ambitious undertaking to do both. Anthropic seems to have decided to focus exclusively on the enterprise and executing that incredibly well. We’re using Claude Code and it’s fantastic, so huge kudos to it. Then, there’ll be a host of other players that become either more enterprise or more consumer focused. But I think Google, Meta, and OpenAI are probably the three that are trying to do both. Meta is probably more consumer-y right now, but clearly has ambitions in the enterprise.

Are you structuring your contracts with these vendors to be long-term or short-term? How do you think about that?

The contracts in that space tend to be relatively long-term. We and they want three-plus-year, commitment-type deals. As much as people want to say, “Oh, I can just swap one for the other,” that’s not really how things work if you’re doing enterprise deployment. So, there’s significant investment in pointing to a platform. And the vendor, of course, wants to see the benefit of your growth and the upfront investment they’re making in helping you come onto their platform. And so they’re three-plus-year deals, sometimes longer.

When do you think you’ll have a feature set using these tools that’s so robust that you can actually charge a premium to all of your customers? Or do you think it will always be —

We kind of do that today. We went from being a signed provider. We’re charging a substantial premium from moving to this AI-assisted suite because of the value. I can provide that value instantly, right? You signed with Docusign, and I can turn on and give you AI insights into your agreements on day one. In fact, we deploy our new products as fast as we can deploy. We deploy in under 20 days, which is kind of unheard of. If you follow enterprise software, that’s kind of unheard of. And frankly, a lot of that is just human stuff because the product is ready on day one.

I think we sign agreements with customers… Our customer agreements right now are around 19 months on average, but they’re longer with big customers and tend to be shorter with smaller customers. That’s a typical pattern. I expect that our agreements will get longer over time, but we already charge a substantial premium to get access to the AI features and customers have been very willing to pay. We have over 25,000 customers live on this new AI platform under 18 months.

I’m always curious about that number, and then I want to wrap up. I’m always curious about that number. I hear these usage numbers from all the companies that deploy AI tools, and underneath it is, well, it just showed up one day and we’re counting that person as an AI user, right? AI overviews are there, everyone loves them and it’s like, “I don’t know about that. They just are in my face whether I want them there.”

Are you actually measuring happy customers using the tools because they want to or because the button is there and everyone just clicks it?

Both. Look, we give you a license for however many users you want. We obviously track the consumption of that license, what are people doing, how often they access their repository, how many searches they do, how many extractions they do, and how many document sendings and document executions they do? We keep a very close eye on that as fundamental health metrics.

I think product adoption leads to renewal and retention, and we are very focused on that. No, not everyone uses the AI features, but we’re seeing really robust usage. We’re constantly looking for more ways for users to discover what’s possible. This is one of the endemic problems of enterprise software. You build this stuff, but how do people actually figure out what’s possible?

The good news is we have something that has a near universal value prop and can be deployed easily. There are all kinds of magic moments where, “Oh, did you know you could do this? ” We’re making that available. So, as you send a document or sign a document, “Hey, would you like an agreement somewhere? Would you like to know how this agreement pairs? Hey, did you know that we have all of them and you can see all this stuff?” It’s a new world. It’s exciting.

I do love that the future of all software is some combination of ultra smart Clippy and Tooltips. There’s something there, someone should write a book on it.

[Laughs] Hopefully we’re providing more value than that.

You’re an enterprise software CEO. You’ve come and you’ve faced the gauntlet. So, I’m going to ask you the hardest question of all. You use your own tools. You started off by saying you use your own tools. What is your biggest frustration with Docusign and how would you fix it as a product?

I don’t think our mobile experience is good enough. I would expect that everything should automatically flow. We should predict the next steps. It all works. Obviously millions of people sign with Docusign daily and often on their phones, but I think there’s still some room for improvement there. So, I’m pushing the team on that.

Well done. You actually answered the question. Most enterprise software CEOs don’t, so I commend you for that. Allan, this has been great. Thank you so much for being on Decoder.

Thank you, Nilay. I really appreciate you having me.

            <p><strong>MIT Technology Review | 2026-02-02</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2026/02/02/1131822/the-crucial-first-step-for-designing-a-successful-enterprise-ai-system/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Many organizations rushed into generative AI, only to see pilots fail to deliver value. Now, companies want measurable outcomes—but how do you design for success?

At Mistral AI, we partner with global industry leaders to co-design tailored AI solutions that solve their most difficult problems. Whether it’s increasing CX productivity with Cisco, building a more intelligent car with Stellantis, or accelerating product innovation with ASML, we start with open frontier models and customize AI systems to deliver impact for each company’s unique challenges and goals.

Our methodology starts by identifying an iconic use case, the foundation for AI transformation that sets the blueprint for future AI solutions. Choosing the right use case can mean the difference between true transformation and endless tinkering and testing.

Mistral AI has four criteria that we look for in a use case: strategic, urgent, impactful, and feasible.

First, the use case must be strategically valuable, addressing a core business process or a transformative new capability. It needs to be more than an optimization; it needs to be a gamechanger. The use case needs to be strategic enough to excite an organization’s C-suite and board of directors.

For example, use cases like an internal-facing HR chatbot are nice to have, but they are easy to solve and are not enabling any new innovation or opportunities. On the other end of the spectrum, imagine an externally facing banking assistant that can not only answer questions, but also help take actions like blocking a card, placing trades, and suggesting upsell/cross-sell opportunities. This is how a customer-support chatbot is turned into a strategic revenue-generating asset.

Second, the best use case to move forward with should be highly urgent and solve a business-critical problem that people care about right now. This project will take time out of people’s days—it needs to be important enough to justify that time investment. And it needs to help business users solve immediate pain points.

Third, the use case should be pragmatic and impactful. From day one, our shared goal with our customers is to deploy into a real-world production environment to enable testing the solution with real users and gather feedback. Many AI prototypes end up in the graveyard of fancy demos that are not good enough to put in front of customers, and without any scaffolding to evaluate and improve. We work with customers to ensure prototypes are stable enough to release, and that they have the necessary support and governance frameworks.

Finally, the best use case is feasible. There may be several urgent projects, but choosing one that can deliver a quick return on investment helps to maintain the momentum needed to continue and scale.

This means looking for a project that can be in production within three months—and a prototype can be live within a few weeks. It’s important to get a prototype in front of end users as fast as possible to get feedback to make sure the project is on track, and pivot as needed.

Enterprises are complex, and the path forward is not usually obvious. To weed through all the possibilities and uncover the right first use case, Mistral AI will run workshops with our customers, hand-in-hand with subject-matter experts and end users.

Representatives from different functions will demo their processes and discuss business cases that could be candidates for a first use case—and together we agree on a winner. Here are some examples of types of projects that don’t qualify.

Moonshots: Ambitious bets that excite leadership but lack a path to quick ROI. While these projects can be strategic and urgent, they rarely meet the feasibility and impact requirements.

Future investments: Long-term plays that can wait. While these projects can be strategic and feasible, they rarely meet the urgency and impact requirements.

Tactical fixes: Firefighting projects that solve immediate pain but don’t move the needle. While these cases can be urgent and feasible, they rarely meet the strategy and impact requirements.

Quick wins: Useful for building momentum, but not transformative. While they can be impactful and feasible, they rarely meet the strategy and urgency requirements.

Blue sky ideas: These projects are gamechangers, but they need maturity to be viable. While they can be strategic and impactful, they rarely meet the urgency and feasibility requirements.

Hero projects: These are high-pressure initiatives that lack executive sponsorship or realistic timelines. While they can be urgent and impactful, they rarely meet the strategy and feasibility requirements.

Once a clearly defined and strategic use case ready for development is identified, it’s time to move into the validation phase. This means doing an initial data exploration and data mapping, identifying a pilot infrastructure, and choosing a target deployment environment.

This step also involves agreeing on a draft pilot scope, identifying who will participate in the proof of concept, and setting up a governance process.

Once this is complete, it’s time to move into the building phase. Companies that partner with Mistral work with our in-house applied AI scientists who build our frontier models. We work together to design, build, and deploy the first solution.

During this phase, we focus on co-creation, so we can transfer knowledge and skills to the organizations we’re partnering with. That way, they can be self-sufficient far into the future. The output of this phase is a deployed AI solution with empowered teams capable of independent operation and innovation.

After the first win, it’s imperative to use the momentum and learnings from the iconic use case to identify more high-value AI solutions to roll out. Success is when we have a scalable AI transformation blueprint with multiple high-value solutions across the organization.

But none of this could happen without successfully identifying that first iconic use case. This first step is not just about selecting a project—it’s about setting the foundation for your entire AI transformation.

It’s the difference between scattered experiments and a strategic, scalable journey toward impact. At Mistral AI, we’ve seen how this approach unlocks measurable value, aligns stakeholders, and builds momentum for what comes next.

The path to AI success starts with a single, well-chosen use case: one that is bold enough to inspire, urgent enough to demand action, and pragmatic enough to deliver.

Inside the marketplace powering bespoke AI deepfakes of real women

Civitai—an online marketplace for buying and selling AI-generated content, backed by the venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz—is letting users buy custom instruction files for generating celebrity deepfakes. Some of these files were specifically designed to make pornographic images banned by the site, a new analysis has found.

The study, from researchers at Stanford and Indiana University, looked at people’s requests for content on the site, called “bounties.” The researchers found that between mid-2023 and the end of 2024, most bounties asked for animated content—but a significant portion were for deepfakes of real people, and 90% of these deepfake requests targeted women.

Demand for electric vehicles and the batteries that power them has never been hotter.

In 2025, EVs made up over a quarter of new vehicle sales globally, up from less than 5% in 2020. Some regions are seeing even higher uptake: In China, more than 50% of new vehicle sales last year were battery electric or plug-in hybrids. In Europe, more purely electric vehicles hit the roads in December than gas-powered ones. (The US is the notable exception here, dragging down the global average with a small sales decline from 2024.)

As EVs become increasingly common on the roads, the battery world is growing too. Here’s what’s coming next for EV batteries in 2026 and beyond.

This story is part of MIT Technology Review’s What’s Next series, which examines industries, trends, and technologies to give you a first look at the future. You can read the rest of them here.

Kyle “KJ” Muldoon Jr. was born with a rare, potentially fatal genetic disorder that left his body unable to remove toxic ammonia from his blood. The University of Pennsylvania offered his parents an alternative to a liver transplant: gene-editing therapies.

The team set to work developing a tailored treatment using base editing—a form of CRISPR that can correct genetic “misspellings” by changing single bases, the basic units of DNA. KJ received an initial low dose when he was seven months old, and later received two higher doses. Today, KJ is doing well. At an event in October last year, his happy parents described how he was meeting all his developmental milestones.

Others have received gene-editing therapies intended to treat conditions including sickle cell disease and a predisposition to high cholesterol. But KJ was the first to receive a personalized treatment—one that was designed just for him and will probably never be used again.

Demand for electric vehicles and the batteries that power them has never been hotter.

In 2025, EVs made up over a quarter of new vehicle sales globally, up from less than 5% in 2020. Some regions are seeing even higher uptake: In China, more than 50% of new vehicle sales last year were battery electric or plug-in hybrids. In Europe, more purely electric vehicles hit the roads in December than gas-powered ones. (The US is the notable exception here, dragging down the global average with a small sales decline from 2024.)

As EVs become increasingly common on the roads, the battery world is growing too. Looking ahead, we could soon see wider adoption of new chemistries, including some that deliver lower costs or higher performance. Meanwhile, the geopolitics of batteries are shifting, and so is the policy landscape. Here’s what’s coming next for EV batteries in 2026 and beyond.

Lithium-ion batteries are the default chemistry used in EVs, personal devices, and even stationary storage systems on the grid today. But in a tough environment in some markets like the US, there’s a growing interest in cheaper alternatives. Automakers right now largely care just about batteries’ cost, regardless of performance improvements, says Kara Rodby, a technical principal at Volta Energy Technologies, a venture capital firm that focuses on energy storage technology.

Sodium-ion cells have long been held up as a potentially less expensive alternative to lithium. The batteries are limited in their energy density, so they deliver a shorter range than lithium-ion. But sodium is also more abundant, so they could be cheaper.

Sodium’s growth has been cursed, however, by the very success of lithium-based batteries, says Shirley Meng, a professor of molecular engineering at the University of Chicago. A lithium-ion battery cell cost $568 per kilowatt-hour in 2013, but that cost had fallen to just $74 per kilowatt-hour by 2025—quite the moving target for cheaper alternatives to chase.

Sodium-ion batteries currently cost about $59 per kilowatt-hour on average. That’s less expensive than the average lithium-ion battery. But if you consider only lithium iron phosphate (LFP) cells, a lower-end type of lithium-ion battery that averages $52 per kilowatt-hour, sodium is still more expensive today.

We could soon see an opening for sodium-batteries, though. Lithium prices have been ticking up in recent months, a shift that could soon slow or reverse the steady downward march of prices for lithium-based batteries.

Sodium-ion batteries are already being used commercially, largely for stationary storage on the grid. But we’re starting to see sodium-ion cells incorporated into vehicles, too. The Chinese companies Yadea, JMEV, and HiNa Battery have all started producing sodium-ion batteries in limited numbers for EVs, including small, short-range cars and electric scooters that don’t require a battery with high energy density. CATL, a Chinese battery company that’s the world’s largest, says it recently began producing sodium-ion cells. The company plans to launch its first EV using the chemistry by the middle of this year.

Today, both production and demand for sodium-ion batteries are heavily centered in China. That’s likely to continue, especially after a cutback in tax credits and other financial support for the battery and EV industries in the US. One of the biggest sodium-battery companies in the US, Natron, ceased operations last year after running into funding issues.

We could also see progress in sodium-ion research: Companies and researchers are developing new materials for components including the electrolyte and electrodes, so the cells could get more comparable to lower-end lithium-ion cells in terms of energy density, Meng says.

As we enter the second half of this decade, many eyes in the battery world are on big promises and claims about solid-state batteries.

These batteries could pack more energy into a smaller package by removing the liquid electrolyte, the material that ions move through when a battery is charging and discharging. With a higher energy density, they could unlock longer-range EVs.

Companies have been promising solid-state batteries for years. Toyota, for example, once planned to have them in vehicles by 2020. That timeline has been delayed several times, though the company says it’s now on track to launch the new cells in cars in 2027 or 2028.

Historically, battery makers have struggled to produce solid-state batteries at the scale needed to deliver a commercially relevant supply for EVs. There’s been progress in manufacturing techniques, though, and companies could soon actually make good on their promises, Meng says.

Factorial Energy, a US-based company making solid-state batteries, provided cells for a Mercedes test vehicle that drove over 745 miles on a single charge in a real-world test in September. The company says it plans to bring its tech to market as soon as 2027. Quantumscape, another major solid-state player in the US, is testing its cells with automotive partners and plans to have its batteries in commercial production later this decade.

Before we see true solid-state batteries, we could see hybrid technologies, often referred to as semi-solid-state batteries. These commonly use materials like gel electrolytes, reducing the liquid inside cells without removing it entirely. Many Chinese companies are looking to build semi-solid-state batteries before transitioning to entirely solid-state ones, says Evelina Stoikou, head of battery technologies and supply chains at BloombergNEF, an energy consultancy.

The picture for the near future of the EV industry looks drastically different depending on where you’re standing.

Last year, China overtook Japan as the country with the most global auto sales. And more than one in three EVs made in 2025 had a CATL battery in it. Simply put, China is dominating the global battery industry, and that doesn’t seem likely to change anytime soon.

China’s influence outside its domestic market is growing especially quickly. CATL is expected to begin production this year at its second European site; the factory, located in Hungary, is an $8.2 billion project that will supply automakers including BMW and the Mercedes-Benz group. Canada recently signed a deal that will lower the import tax on Chinese EVs from 100% to roughly 6%, effectively opening the Canadian market for Chinese EVs.

Some countries that haven’t historically been major EV markets could become bigger players in the second half of the decade. Annual EV sales in Thailand and Vietnam, where the market was virtually nonexistent just a few years ago, broke 100,000 in 2025. Brazil, in particular, could see its new EV sales more than double in 2026 as major automakers including Volkswagen and BYD set up or ramp up production in the country.

On the flip side, EVs are facing a real test in 2026 in the US, as this will be the first calendar year after the sunset of federal tax credits that were designed to push more drivers to purchase the vehicles. With those credits gone, growth in sales is expected to continue lagging.

One bright spot for batteries in the US is outside the EV market altogether. Battery manufacturers are starting to produce low-cost LFP batteries in the US, largely for energy storage applications. LG opened a massive factory to make LFP batteries in mid-2025 in Michigan, and the Korean battery company SK On plans to start making LFP batteries at its facility in Georgia later this year. Those plants could help battery companies cash in on investments as the US EV market faces major headwinds.

Even as the US lags behind, the world is electrifying transportation. By 2030, 40% of new vehicles sold around the world are projected to be electric. As we approach that milestone, expect to see more global players, a wider selection of EVs, and an even wider menu of batteries to power them.

As early electric cars age out, hundreds of thousands of used batteries are flooding the market, fueling a gray recycling economy even as Beijing and big manufacturers scramble to build a more orderly system.

A cheaper, safer, and more abundant alternative to lithium is finally making its way into cars—and the grid.

The debate around deepfakes, as illustrated by the recent backlash to explicit images on the X-owned chatbot Grok, has revolved around what platforms should do to block such content. Civitai’s situation is a little more complicated. Its marketplace includes actual images, videos, and models, but it also lets individuals buy and sell instruction files called LoRAs that can coach mainstream AI models like Stable Diffusion into generating content they were not trained to produce. Users can then combine these files with other tools to make deepfakes that are graphic or sexual. The researchers found that 86% of deepfake requests on Civitai were for LoRAs.

In these bounties, users requested “high quality” models to generate images of public figures like the influencer Charli D’Amelio or the singer Gracie Abrams, often linking to their social media profiles so their images could be grabbed from the web. Some requests specified a desire for models that generated the individual’s entire body, accurately captured their tattoos, or allowed hair color to be changed. Some requests targeted several women in specific niches, like artists who record ASMR videos. One request was for a deepfake of a woman said to be the user’s wife. Anyone on the site could offer up AI models they worked on for the task, and the best submissions received payment—anywhere from $0.50 to $5. And nearly 92% of the deepfake bounties were awarded.

Neither Civitai nor Andreessen Horowitz responded to requests for comment.

It’s possible that people buy these LoRAs to make deepfakes that aren’t sexually explicit (though they’d still violate Civitai’s terms of use, and they’d still be ethically fraught). But Civitai also offers educational resources on how to use external tools to further customize the outputs of image generators—for example, by changing someone’s pose. The site also hosts user-written articles with details on how to instruct models to generate pornography. The researchers found that the amount of porn on the platform has gone up, and that the majority of requests each week are now for NSFW content.

“Not only does Civitai provide the infrastructure that facilitates these issues; they also explicitly teach their users how to utilize them,” says Matthew DeVerna, a postdoctoral researcher at Stanford’s Cyber Policy Center and one of the study’s leaders.

The company used to ban only sexually explicit deepfakes of real people, but in May 2025 it announced it would ban all deepfake content. Nonetheless, countless requests for deepfakes submitted before this ban now remain live on the site, and many of the winning submissions fulfilling those requests remain available for purchase, MIT Technology Review confirmed.

“I believe the approach that they’re trying to take is to sort of do as little as possible, such that they can foster as much—I guess they would call it—creativity on the platform,” DeVerna says.

Users buy LoRAs with the site’s online currency, called Buzz, which is purchased with real money. In May 2025, Civita’s credit card processor cut off the company because of its ongoing problem with nonconsensual content. To pay for explicit content, users must now use gift cards or cryptocurrency to buy Buzz; the company offers a different scrip for non-explicit content.

Civitai automatically tags bounties requesting deepfakes and lists a way for the person featured in the content to manually request its takedown. This system means that Civitai has a reasonably successful way of knowing which bounties are for deepfakes, but it’s still leaving moderation to the general public rather than carrying it out proactively.

A company’s legal liability for what its users do isn’t totally clear. Generally, tech companies have broad legal protections against such liability for their content under Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, but those protections aren’t limitless. For example, “you cannot knowingly facilitate illegal transactions on your website,” says Ryan Calo, a professor specializing in technology and AI at the University of Washington’s law school. (Calo wasn’t involved in this new study.)

Civitai joined OpenAI, Anthropic, and other AI companies in 2024 in adopting design principles to guard against the creation and spread of AI-generated child sexual abuse material . This move followed a 2023 report from the Stanford Internet Observatory, which found that the vast majority of AI models named in child sexual abuse communities were Stable Diffusion–based models “predominantly obtained via Civitai.”

But adult deepfakes have not gotten the same level of attention from content platforms or the venture capital firms that fund them. “They are not afraid enough of it. They are overly tolerant of it,” Calo says. “Neither law enforcement nor civil courts adequately protect against it. It is night and day.”

Civitai received a $5 million investment from Andreessen Horowitz (a16z) in November 2023. In a video shared by a16z, Civitai cofounder and CEO Justin Maier described his goal of building the main place where people find and share AI models for their own individual purposes. “We’ve aimed to make this space that’s been very, I guess, niche and engineering-heavy more and more approachable to more and more people,” he said.

Civitai is not the only company with a deepfake problem in a16z’s investment portfolio; in February, MIT Technology Review first reported that another company, Botify AI, was hosting AI companions resembling real actors that stated their age as under 18, engaged in sexually charged conversations, offered “hot photos,” and in some instances described age-of-consent laws as “arbitrary” and “meant to be broken.”

How the sometimes-weird world of lifespan extension is gaining influence

—Jessica HamzelouFor the last couple of years, I’ve been following the progress of a group of individuals who believe death is humanity’s “core problem.” Put simply, they say death is wrong—for everyone. They’ve even said it’s morally wrong.

They established what they consider a new philosophy, and they called it Vitalism.Vitalism is more than a philosophy, though—it’s a movement for hardcore longevity enthusiasts who want to make real progress in finding treatments that slow or reverse aging. Not just through scientific advances, but by persuading influential people to support their movement, and by changing laws and policies to open up access to experimental drugs. And they’re starting to make progress.

            <div id="article-text">For the last couple of years, I’ve been following the progress of a group of individuals who believe death is humanity’s “core problem.” Put simply, they say death is wrong—for everyone. They’ve even said it’s morally wrong.

They established what they consider a new philosophy, and they called it Vitalism.

Vitalism is more than a philosophy, though—it’s a movement for hardcore longevity enthusiasts who want to make real progress in finding treatments that slow or reverse aging. Not just through scientific advances, but by persuading influential people to support their movement, and by changing laws and policies to open up access to experimental drugs.

Vitalism was founded by Adam Gries and Nathan Cheng—two men who united over their shared desire to find ways to extend human lifespan. I first saw Cheng speak back in 2023, at Zuzalu, a pop-up city in Montenegro for people who were interested in life extension and some other technologies. (It was an interesting experience—you can read more about it here.)

Zuzalu was where Gries and Cheng officially launched Vitalism. But I’ve been closely following the longevity scene since 2022. That journey took me to Switzerland, Honduras, and a compound in Berkeley, California, where like-minded longevity enthusiasts shared their dreams of life extension.

It also took me to Washington, DC, where, last year, supporters of lifespan extension presented politicians including Mehmet Oz, who currently leads the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, with their case for changes to laws and policies.

The journey has been fascinating, and at times weird and even surreal. I’ve heard biohacking stories that ended with smoking legs. I’ve been told about a multi-partner relationship that might be made possible through the cryopreservation—and subsequent reanimation—of a man and the multiple wives he’s had throughout his life. I’ve had people tell me to my face that they consider themselves eugenicists, and that they believe that parents should select IVF embryos for their propensity for a long life.

I’ve seen people draw blood during dinner in an upscale hotel restaurant to test their biological age. I’ve heard wild plans to preserve human consciousness and resurrect it in machines. Others have told me their plans to inject men’s penises with multiple doses of an experimental gene therapy in order to treat erectile dysfunction and ultimately achieve “radical longevity.”

I’ve been shouted at and threatened with legal action. I’ve received barefoot hugs. One interviewee told me I needed Botox. It’s been a ride.

My reporting has also made me realize that the current interest in longevity reaches beyond social media influencers and wellness centers. Longevity clinics are growing in number, and there’s been a glut of documentaries about living longer or even forever.

At the same time, powerful people who influence state laws, giant federal funding budgets, and even national health policy are prioritizing the search for treatments that slow or reverse aging. The longevity community was thrilled when longtime supporter Jim O’Neill was made deputy secretary of health and human services last year. Other members of Trump’s administration, including Oz, have spoken about longevity too. “It seems that now there is the most pro-longevity administration in American history,” Gries told me.

I recently spoke to Alicia Jackson, the new director of ARPA-H. The agency, established in 2022 under Joe Biden’s presidency, funds “breakthrough” biomedical research. And it appears to have a new focus on longevity. Jackson previously founded and led Evernow, a company focused on “health and longevity for every woman.”

“There’s a lot of interesting technologies, but they all kind of come back to the same thing: Could we extend life years?” she told me over a Zoom call a few weeks ago. She added that her agency had “incredible support” from “the very top of HHS.” I asked if she was referring to Jim O’Neill. “Yeah,” she said. She wouldn’t go into the specifics.

Gries is right: There is a lot of support for advances in longevity treatments, and some of it is coming from influential people in positions of power. Perhaps the field really is poised for a breakthrough.

And that’s what makes this field so fascinating to cover. Despite the occasional weirdness.

            <div id="article-text">Every January, millions take on Dry January, a ritual of restraint and resetting after the holiday season. If that’s the benchmark for kicking off the year with moderation, Europe’s startup ecosystem clearly didn’t get the memo.

In the opening weeks of 2026, the region saw five startups join the unicorn club, crossing the $1 billion valuation mark across sectors as varied as cybersecurity, cloud optimisation, defence tech, ESG software, and education technology.

January was anything but dry for European companies. This burst of activity signals more than a funding spike; it invites a deeper look at what Europe’s innovation identity looks like today. Across the continent, there’s a stronger sense that Europe can produce and scale world-class tech companies in its own right, rather than just nurture later-stage spin-offs or see them acquired by U.S. firms.

While the United States still leads in overall startup volume and ecosystem strength, Europe’s recent momentum shows its innovation landscape is maturing and gaining confidence on the global stage.

Europe was already home to over 217 unicorns by late 2025, spread across fintech, AI, enterprise software, and other domains. That’s a milestone for a region whose venture culture has historically leaned toward caution.

What’s notable isn’t simply the number of new billion-dollar companies, but their variety. Gone are the days when a single sector, often generative AI, defined European unicorn trajectories. Here we see cybersecurity, cloud optimisation, defence-oriented software, sustainability data, and education marketplaces all earning top valuations and investor backing.

The broader context matters. In 2025, deep-tech and university spinouts, including companies in aerospace, robotics, materials, sensors, and health sciences, saw near record levels of funding, and many achieved significant valuation or revenue milestones.

This goes hand in hand with a narrative that’s become increasingly clear: European capital is being more deliberate than exuberant. Rather than inflate every trend label, investors are writing checks where traction, revenue models, and regulatory demand converge. That’s why platforms helping companies with compliance and ESG reporting, or infrastructure for cloud efficiency, are winning attention alongside defence-tech innovators.

Europe’s tech ecosystem has matured, even if it still faces hurdles. Venture funding peaked in recent years and then dipped; for example, total European VC investment in 2024 was reported to be around $45 billion, down from earlier highs. Yet the valuation achievements and funding depth remain meaningful.

This apparent paradox highlights a structural shift: rather than broad flows of unfettered capital, funding is now more selective and outcome-oriented. Investors, LPs, and strategic partners are looking for proof of product-market fit, regulatory differentiation, and defensible business models.

Fragmentation across markets and languages, long considered a European challenge, can also be a strength when paired with clusters of domain expertise, cybersecurity hubs in Belgium, deep tech in the Nordics, cloud infrastructure in the Baltics, and education technology with strong ties to diverse EU labour markets. Observers have noted that these clusters are attracting venture dollars, even if not every founder heads straight for the Bay Area.

Policy tools and institutional support are increasingly part of the backdrop for European innovation. The European Union’s research and innovation framework programmes, most notably Horizon Europe, are directing substantial resources toward areas such as digital transformation, strategic autonomy, and industrial competitiveness.

For 2021–2027, Horizon Europe is the EU’s flagship funding programme for research and innovation, with an overall budget of around €93.5 billion allocated to boost competitiveness, address climate and social challenges, and support key technologies from AI to advanced manufacturing.

This support matters because initiatives that might once have felt niche, advanced sensors, ESG compliance tools, or technologies with both civil and defence applications, now align clearly with broader strategic goals set out in the EU’s innovation plans.

Calls under Horizon Europe Cluster 4 – Digital, Industry and Space, and related programmes bring together public and private partners to tackle digital and green transitions, pooling resources and creating coherent pathways from research to commercial deployment.

That’s why this month’s unicorn news feels less like a fluke and more like a phase transition.

So what does it all mean? Are these five new unicorns signs of a sustainable upswing or just a temporary blip in enterprise valuations?

They’re arguably both: an indicator that Europe’s startup engine still runs on thoughtful investment, real use cases, and foundational problems, and a challenge to continue scaling that momentum into later-stage growth and exits.

Europe doesn’t need to be Silicon Valley. It never really did. What it needs is confidence in its own values, disciplined capital, diverse innovation, and regulation as an enabler, not a constraint.

If this is Europe’s tech moment, it’s not marked by headline-grabbing valuations alone. It’s defined by the breadth of problems being solved and the depth of conviction behind those solutions.

            <div id="article-text">We are all familiar with the subscription economy, and it certainly works as a reminder of the COVID-19 pandemic, when we were all hooked on our TVs watching Netflix or listening to our favorite music artist on Spotify.

Despite how modern it seems to be, the truth is that the subscription economy has been around for some time, surprisingly dating back to around 1800, with the first magazine subscriptions, or the subscriptions for fresh British milk, around 1860.

Over the years, the of subscription-based companies has turned the subscription model into an ideal business strategy since it provides unique benefits. In the same way, the adoption of this model across multiple industries has led to negative repercussions for the general public.

The subscription economy is a recurring-revenue model in which products or services are delivered daily under a temporary or perpetual subscription in exchange for a fixed price, growing considerably in the last 20 years.

According to the last report in the Subscription Economy Market 2025 by Juniper, the global market had a total revenue of $722B in 2025, with a forecasted total revenue of $1.2T by 2030, with an average annual growth rate of more than 15%. Software as a service (SaaS) remains the biggest part of the subscription market with a revenue of more than $250B by 2022. The car rethinking industry, e-mobility application area, and the digitization of the health sector are expected to be enormously scaled by 2030.

The European market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 17.50% in the forecast period of 2026-2035. The main industry leaders within the region are beauty, food, and digital subscriptions. Whereas the countries where the subscription market stands out are the UK (beauty and personal care), Germany (software and consumer goods), France (food and beverage), and Italy and Spain (digital subscription and other categories).

A study made by Advances in Consumer Research (ACR) journal highlights how this model is great for businesses because it provides steady income, low upfront costs, and consistent lifetime value (the total value a customer provides to a company over their relationship), while promoting brand loyalty. It also offers unique advantages for consumers, such as a customer-centric approach focused on personalizing services, products and experiences, and experiences; convenient, time-saving solutions; cost-effectiveness; access to a diverse range of products rather than ownership of a few; and even social recognition and identity.

The gaming industry had a steady increase after the COVID-19 pandemic, introducing subscription-based services, which have become regular within the industry. The business model is simple: gamers pay a subscription fee to access gaming services, and there are three different options for customers:

The global market for subscription-based gaming was estimated at $10.1B in 2023 and is forecasted to reach $21.3B by 2030, growing at a CAGR of 11.3% from 2023 to 2030.

It has been popularized due to its affordability and convenience, since the subscription to platforms enables players the flexibility to pay multiple games with an affordable fee.

The subscription model also offers unique advantages for companies, such as reduction of upfront costs since the games are directly streamed from servers, promoted by the technological development of high-speed internet infrastructure and 5G, cloud gaming service, cross-platform accounts, family plans, and leveraged AI to offer personalized game recommendations based on user behavior.

Another industry that is adapting to market and customer expectations is healthcare. As a response to technological and societal advancements, subscription medical care is increasing in popularity within the US, expected to reach $15.1bn by 2032.

Health tech represents a great opportunity for individuals and businesses since it introduces cost predictability, personalized attention, and wellness data. Healthcare providers and health tech companies are leveraging the use of AI, since it facilitates the data analysis process, helping health professionals to make more accurate and efficient diagnoses.

Within the health care and health tech industry, there are several subscription-based models, such as:

The subscription economy has expanded to other services, such as education. Since the customer expectations and behavior is demanding accessible, personalized content at an affordable price, the global e-learning market is growing and expected to reach $1T by 2032 with subscription models leading.

The key drivers for growth are the increasing use of VR and AR in e-learning, digital transformation, and the partnership of universities and diversity in offerings. Some of the most used platforms worldwide are Duolingo, Coursera, and FutureLearn, among others.

Another industry that has greatly benefitted with the subscription model is the creator economy. Content creators are increasingly looking to subscription platforms such as Patreon, OnlyFans, and Substack, adopting them as a solution in a volatile economy and competitive markets, where creators heavily depended on paid partnerships and platform payouts, this way ensuring a stable monthly recurring revenue.

The key drivers for the growth of this market are, whatsoever, slightly different than the previously mentioned: audiences want to pay for a deeper relationship with the creator than passive scrolling, whether of its niche expertise or personal connection.

Despite all the unique benefits that the subscription model offers for customers and companies, the quick expansion and adoption of this model has led to negative effects in the audiences, which become challenges for the companies. You may be familiar with the concept of subscription fatigue, which reflects the customers’ reluctance to engage with multiple subscriptions.

This phenomenon was born due to the saturation in the expanding market and is driven by “lack of perceived value, hidden or unpredictable fees and loss of control,” fomenting churn (percentage of customers who cancel their subscription) for customers to save money or just because the service seems not useful for them.

Another challenge for companies is the constant pressure for ongoing investment in product development and customer engagement, especially in industries with minimal product differentiation, such as the streaming platforms industry. High production costs and limited audience engagement increase this model’s financial struggles, adding pressure on companies to deliver valuable services while generating profit.

Subscription models are no longer limited to entertainment platforms. They have become a core part of modern digital business strategies, offering predictable revenue streams for companies and enhancing customer experience.

The next phase will likely combine hybrid subscription models with usage-based pricing and data-driven personalization. To remain competitive, companies will need to adapt to consumer expectations by offering flexible prices and plans, pause options, bundling strategies, and partnerships across platforms.

Ultimately, the main challenge right now is how to design models that deliver long-term value without overwhelming users, balancing profitability with meaningful user experience.

            <p><strong>The Next Web | 2026-01-30</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://thenextweb.com/news/apple-buys-silent-speech-ai-startup-for-2b-because-talking-is-so-2025">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Apple confirmed this week that it has acquired Israeli AI startup Q.ai in a deal valued at close to $2 billion, making it one of the company’s largest acquisitions ever, second only to the $3 billion purchase of Beats in 2014.

But check your assumptions: this isn’t Beats 2.0. There’s no new headphone brand to flex. Instead, Apple is paying top dollar for tech that might let your devices understand you without you ever saying a word.

​​These days we put our phones on silent so they won’t disturb us; soon the phone will put us on silent so it can understand us.

Q.ai has been operating in secrecy since its founding in 2022. Its machine-learning research focuses on interpreting “silent speech”, detecting imperceptible facial micro-movements, and subtle audio cues to infer what someone means to say.

Patents suggest this tech could work in headphones, smart glasses, or other wearables so users can issue commands privately, even in a quiet library.

That future has a decidedly dramatic edge: imagine telling Siri to skip a track or read your messages without ever parting your lips. Apple executives call the acquisition a way to fuse machine learning with next-generation hardware.

Longtime Apple watcher Johny Srouji praised Q.ai as “a remarkable company that is pioneering new and creative ways to use imaging and machine learning.”

At first blush, spending almost $2 billion on not speaking might sound like corporate futurism taken to a comic extreme. We already have voice assistants that sometimes struggle to understand us when we do speak.

Yet here’s Apple’s bet: once devices can interpret faint facial cues, the entire paradigm of human-computer interaction shifts, from keyboards and taps to gestures and barely-audible intentions.

This move also signals how Apple’s AI strategy is evolving. Some critical voices have noted that the company has lagged behind competitors in generative AI and conversational assistants, even partnering with Google to bring Gemini-powered features into its ecosystem. Acquiring Q.ai suggests Cupertino isn’t just chasing language models; it wants to redefine the interface itself.

There’s a strange poetry to this. In an era when every tech giant is clamouring to make their AI chatty, Apple is buying a company that may prime its devices to be less vocal, more intuitive, and perhaps eerily discreet.

It’s the sort of paradox that defines modern tech: a quieter future might demand the loudest investment.

If this sounds like science fiction, well, it does. But Q.ai’s technology, as described in recent reports, could translate into features in AirPods, Vision Pro headsets, or future wearables as soon as 2027. Could it help Siri finally feel less like a confused concierge and more like an unseen assistant tuned to your intent? That remains to be seen.

Either way, Apple’s big wager on silent speech reminds us that innovation doesn’t always roar. Sometimes, it listens for the quietest signals and pays dearly for them.

            <a class="original-link" href="https://thenextweb.com/news/g2-bold-move-to-reshape-software-discovery-with-major-acquisition-from-gartner">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">G2, the Chicago-based software insights platform, agreed today to acquire three prominent software review and discovery properties from Gartner: Capterra, Software Advice, and GetApp.

The deal brings four of the largest B2B review sites under a single roof and signals a shift toward unified, AI-driven software recommendation and buying experiences.

According to the announcement, the combined business will include roughly six million verified customer reviews and tap into an audience of more than 200 million annual software buyers. G2 said it expects the transaction to close in the first quarter of 2026, subject to standard regulatory and closing conditions.

G2’s leadership frames the agreement as a response to fragmentation in the software buying journey. By consolidating multiple review databases and audiences, the company aims to streamline discovery for buyers and expand demand-generation tools for vendors.

TNW City Coworking space - Where your best work happens

A workspace designed for growth, collaboration, and endless networking opportunities in the heart of tech.

In a public post, G2’s CEO described the integration as building “the trusted data foundation for B2B software in the age of AI,” with deeper buyer intent signals and a more consistent taxonomy across categories.

For buyers, the enlarged platform promises easier access to user-verified feedback and faster decision cycles. For software vendors, the unified dataset could translate into broader visibility and enhanced market insights.

G2’s roadmap includes tighter AI integration across search and recommendation workflows.

Gartner, which currently owns Capterra, Software Advice, and GetApp, has held these properties for years as part of its digital markets portfolio.

This divestiture appears to reflect a strategic choice to focus its core research and advisory business while enabling specialized review platforms to evolve under a dedicated marketplace operator.

As the software market continues to expand, the consolidation of review infrastructure under G2 could reshape how products are evaluated and purchased.

The market will watch closely for how the combined entity leverages its scale to influence search visibility and buyer influence metrics in 2026 and beyond.
