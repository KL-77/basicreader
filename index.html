            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2026/01/how-to-encrypt-your-pcs-disk-without-giving-the-keys-to-microsoft/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">In early 2025, Forbes reports, investigators at the FBI served Microsoft with a warrant seeking the BitLocker encryption recovery keys for several laptops it believed held evidence of fraud in Guam’s COVID-19 unemployment assistance program. And Microsoft complied with the FBI’s request.

BitLocker is the name of the full-disk encryption technology that has been part of Windows for nearly two decades. Though initially only available to owners of the Pro editions of Windows who turned it on manually, during the Windows 8 era Microsoft began using BitLocker to encrypt local disks automatically for all Windows 11 Home and Pro PCs that signed in with a Microsoft account. Using BitLocker in this way also uploads a recovery key for your device to Microsoft’s servers—this makes it possible to unlock your disk so you don’t lose data if something goes wrong with your system, or if you install a CPU upgrade or some other hardware change that breaks BitLocker. But it also (apparently) makes it possible for Microsoft to unlock your disk, too.

A Microsoft rep said that the company handled “around 20” similar BitLocker recovery key requests from government authorities per year, and that these requests often fail because users haven’t stored their recovery keys on Microsoft’s servers. Microsoft and other tech companies have generally refused requests to install universal encryption backdoors for law enforcement purposes, and some companies (like Apple) claim to store device encryption keys using another layer of encryption that renders the keys inaccessible to the company.

But storing your device’s recovery keys in someone else’s cloud can still represent a privacy and security risk, especially at a time when the US government has become more interested in targeting journalists and the Trump administration’s political opponents.

If you want to encrypt your Windows PC’s disk but you don’t want to store your recovery key with Microsoft, you do have options. We’ll recap the requirements, as well as the steps you’ll need to take.

Before we begin: Disk encryption is one of the handful of differences between the Home and Pro versions of Windows.

Both the Home and Pro versions of Windows support disk encryption, but only the Pro versions give users full control over the process. The Home version of Windows only supports disk encryption when logged in with a Microsoft account and will only offer to store your encryption key on Microsoft’s servers.

To access the full version of BitLocker and back up your own recovery key, you’ll need to upgrade to the Pro version of Windows. Microsoft offers its own first-party upgrade option through the Microsoft Store for a one-time fee of $99, but it’s also possible to bring your own product key and upgrade yourself. This Macworld-affiliated listing from StackCommerce claims to be an official Microsoft partner and is offering a Windows 11 Pro key for just $10, though your mileage with third-party key resellers may vary.

However you get it, once you have a valid key, open Settings, then System, then Activation, click upgrade your edition of Windows, click change product key, and then enter your Windows 11 Pro key (Windows 10 Pro keys should also work, if you already have one). Luckily, changing Windows editions doesn’t require anything more disruptive than a system restart. You won’t need to reinstall Windows, and you shouldn’t lose any of your installed apps or data.

And once you’ve upgraded a PC to Windows 11 Pro once, you should be able to reinstall and activate Windows 11 Pro on that system again any time you want without having to re-enter your product key. Keep the product key stored somewhere, though, just in case you do need to use it for a reinstall, or if you ever need to re-activate Windows after a hardware upgrade.

Once you’ve got Windows 11 Pro set up, it’s time to either encrypt or re-encrypt your disk.

If you’ve signed in with a Microsoft account, your disk is likely already encrypted, and the key is likely already stored on Microsoft’s servers. If this is the case, this process will actually involve fully unencrypting and re-encrypting your drive, which can take an hour or two depending on the speed of your PC and the size of your drive.

Here’s how to check your current encryption status and the steps to follow if you’ve already got a key backed up with Microsoft:

Once your disk is re-encrypted, your PC should work just as it did before. The actual encryption technology hasn’t changed at all—all we’ve done is change where the recovery key is saved.

This does put the burden on the user if and when it comes time to use your recovery key. You’ll have to remember where you put it and not get it mixed up with any other recovery keys you’ve stored for other PCs or old Windows installations. But for anyone concerned about Microsoft giving their device’s encryption keys to the government or anyone else with a valid subpoena, the extra hassle may be worth it in exchange for the added privacy and peace of mind.</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Universal Pictures and Illumination dropped a new trailer for the upcoming Super Mario Galaxy Movie, and gaming fans will no doubt be delighted at the news that Yoshi, the little green dinosaur, features prominently, along with plenty of other Easter eggs for sharp-eyed fans.

As previously reported, the first attempt at a Super Mario movie adaptation in 1993 was notoriously a dismal failure, although it still has its ’90s-nostalgic fans. But 2023’s Super Mario Bros. Movie won over gaming fans who were skeptical about another adaptation—including Ars Senior Gaming Editor Kyle Orland.

The 2023 film reintroduced Mario and Luigi, two tight-knit but struggling Brooklyn plumbers who got separated when they unexpectedly fell into the fantastical Mushroom Kingdom. Mario sought Princess Peach’s help to rescue his brother from the evil clutches of Bowser, ruler of the Dark Lands, who was keen to marry Peach and threatened to destroy the Mushroom Kingdom with a Super Star if she refused him. So Peach led Mario on a quest to recruit allies and stop Bowser for good. They succeeded, shrinking Bowser and imprisoning him in a jar. Mario and Luigi moved to the Mushroom Kingdom and continued their plumbing work there.

The main voice cast is returning for the sequel: Chris Pratt as Mario, Charlie Day as Luigi, Anya Taylor-Joy as Princess Peach, Jack Black as Bowser, Keegan-Michael Key as the anthropomorphic mushroom Toad, and Kevin Michael Richardson as Bowser’s advisor and informant Kamek. We’re also getting two new cast members: Brie Larson as Princess Rosalina, protector of the cosmos and the Lumas, and Benny Safdie as Bowser, Jr., Bowser’s son and heir to the throne. Directors Aaron Horvath and Michael Jelenic are also back, as is screenwriter Matthew Fogel.

Details on the actual plot are fuzzy, but the first trailer (released last November) focused on Bowser and Bowser Jr., who seemed intent on freeing his dad and (one assumes) taking revenge on the brothers. This latest trailer shows Mario and Luigi at the scene of a “troubled” pipe in the desert of San Kingdom, populated by the sombrero-wearing Tostarenans. When they clear away some rubble covering an opening, who should be lurking inside but Yoshi—not a monster to hit with fire flowers, but a friendly green dinosaur. Yoshi is keen to join the team, although Toad seems less than impressed.

The Super Mario Galaxy Movie hits theaters on April 1, 2026.</div>

            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2026/01/tiktok-glitches-caused-by-data-center-power-outage-us-joint-venture-says/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">TikTok has been glitching for US users since Sunday, and TikTok’s new US owners have finally confirmed the cause: a power outage at a US data center.

“Since yesterday we’ve been working to restore our services following a power outage at a US data center impacting TikTok and other apps we operate,” the TikTok USDS Joint Venture posted on X on Monday morning. “We’re working with our data center partner to stabilize our service. We’re sorry for this disruption and hope to resolve it soon.”

A DownDetector report tracking outages showed problems began early Sunday morning, with the majority of problems seemingly resolved by early Monday. However, The Verge reported that some US users continue to experience issues, including issues logging in, long delays uploading videos, generic content flooding For You pages, problems accessing comments, and other issues.

It’s clear that the TikTok USDS Joint Venture is still working to resolve problems connected to the power outage. But their decision to remain silent while the app got buggy during the first weekend under the control of right-wing US owners hand-picked by Donald Trump sparked conspiracy theories on social media that the app had begun censoring left-leaning users.

As the app comes back online, users have also taken note that TikTok is collecting more of their data under US control. As Wired reported, TikTok asked US users to agree to a new terms of service and privacy policy, which allows TikTok to potentially collect “more detailed information about its users, including precise location data.”

“Before this update, the app did not collect the precise, GPS-derived location data of US users,” Wired reported. “Now, if you give TikTok permission to use your phone’s location services, then the app may collect granular information about your exact whereabouts.”

New policies also pushed users to agree to share all their AI interactions, which allows TikTok to store their metadata and trace AI inputs back to specific accounts.

Already seeming more invasive and less reliable, for TikTok users, questions likely remain how much their favorite app might change under new ownership, as the TikTok USDS Joint Venture prepares to retrain the app’s algorithm.

Trump has said that he wants to see the app become “100 percent MAGA,” prompting fears that “For You” pages might soon be flooded with right-wing content or that leftist content like anti-ICE criticism might be suppressed. And The Information reported in July that transferring millions of users over to the US-trained app is expected to cause more “technical issues.”</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Over the years, hackers and modders at large have made it their mission to port classic first-person shooter Doom to practically anything with a display. Recently, though, coder Arin Sarkisan has taken the “Can it Run Doom?” idea in an unlikely direction: wireless earbuds that aren’t designed to output graphics at all.

To be clear, this hack doesn’t apply to any generic set of earbuds. The “Doombuds” project is designed specifically for the PineBuds Pro, which are unique in featuring completely open source firmware and a community-maintained SDK.

That means Sarkisan was able to code up a JavaScript interface that uses the earbuds’ UART contact pads to send a heavily compressed MJPEG video stream to a web server (via a serial server). The 2.4 MB/s data stream from the UART connection can put out about 22 to 27 frames per second in this format, which is more than enough for a CPU that can only run the game at a maximum of 18 fps anyway.

Squeezing the entirety of Doom onto modern earbuds wasn’t an easy task, either. The 4.2MB of game data won’t quite fit on the PineBuds’ 4MB of flash memory, for instance. That means the project needed to use a 1.7MB “squashware” build of Doom, which eliminates some animation frames and shortens some music tracks to make the game even more portable.

The earbuds also have just under 1MB of RAM, requiring the coding of a new version of the game that optimizes away many of the bits that usually fill up a full 4MB of RAM in the standard game. “Pre-generating lookup tables, making variables const, reading const variables from flash, disabling DOOM’s caching system, removing unneeded variables… it all adds up,” Sarkisan writes.

For those without their own PineBuds to test this wild idea, Sarkisan has set up an interactive Twitch stream that players can queue up to control for 45-second sessions via doombuds.com. It’s a great little break-time diversion, especially for people ready to marvel that a set of $70 earbuds can now run a game that required a $1,000-plus computer tower a few decades ago.</div>

            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2026/01/eu-launches-formal-investigation-of-xai-over-groks-sexualized-deepfakes/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The EU has launched a formal investigation into Elon Musk’s xAI following a public outcry over how its Grok chatbot spread sexualized images of women and children.

The billionaire entrepreneur has come under scrutiny from regulators around the world this month after people began using Grok to generate deepfakes of people without consent. The images were posted on the X social network as well as the separate Grok app, both of which are run by xAI.

The probe, announced on Monday under the EU’s Digital Services Act, will assess if xAI tried to mitigate the risks of deploying Grok’s tools on X and the proliferation of content that “may amount to child sexual abuse material.”

“Non-consensual sexual deepfakes of women and children are a violent, unacceptable form of degradation,” the EU’s tech chief, Henna Virkkunen, said.

“With this investigation, we will determine whether X has met its legal obligations under the DSA, or whether it treated rights of European citizens—including those of women and children—as collateral damage of its service.”

If the company is found to be in breach of the rules, the bloc can impose fines worth up to 6 percent of the worldwide annual turnover. An EU official said there will be no interim measures during the investigation.

The European probe comes after UK media regulator Ofcom opened a formal investigation into Grok, while Malaysia and Indonesia have banned the chatbot altogether.

Following the backlash, xAI restricted the use of Grok to paying subscribers and said it has “implemented technological measures” to limit Grok from generating certain sexualized images.

Musk has also said “anyone using Grok to make illegal content will suffer the same consequences as if they upload illegal content.”

An EU official said that “with the harm that is exposed to individuals that are subject to these images, we have not been convinced so far by what mitigating measures the platform has taken to have that under control.”

The company, which acquired Musk’s social media site X last year, has designed its AI products to have fewer content “guardrails” than competitors such as OpenAI and Google. Musk called its Grok model “maximally truth-seeking.”

The commission fined X €120 million in December last year for breaching its regulations for transparency, providing insufficient access to data and the deceptive design of its blue ticks for verified accounts.

The fine was criticized by Musk and the US government, with the Trump administration claiming the EU was unfairly targeting American groups and infringing freedom of speech principles championed by the Maga movement.

            <div id="article-text">Crew members traveling to the lunar surface on NASA’s Artemis missions should be gearing up for a grind. They will wear heavier spacesuits than those worn by the Apollo astronauts, and NASA will ask them to do more than the first Moonwalkers did more than 50 years ago.

The Moonwalking experience will amount to an “extreme physical event” for crews selected for the Artemis program’s first lunar landings, a former NASA astronaut told a panel of researchers, physicians, and engineers convened by the National Academies.

Kate Rubins, who retired from the space agency last year, presented the committee with her views on the health risks for astronauts on lunar missions. She outlined the concerns NASA officials often talk about: radiation exposure, muscle and bone atrophy, reduced cardiovascular and immune function, and other adverse medical effects of spaceflight.

Scientists and astronauts have come to understand many of these effects after a quarter-century of continuous human presence on the International Space Station. But the Moon is different in a few important ways. The Moon is outside the protection of the Earth’s magnetosphere, lunar dust is pervasive, and the Moon has partial gravity, about one-sixth as strong as the pull we feel on Earth.

Each of these presents challenges for astronauts living and working on the lunar surface, and their effects are amplified for crew members who venture outside for spacewalks. NASA selected Axiom Space, a Houston-based company, for a $228 million fixed-price contract to develop commercial pressurized spacesuits for the Artemis III mission, slated to be the first human landing mission on the Moon since 1972.

NASA hopes to fly the Artemis III mission by the end of 2028, but the schedule is in question. The readiness of Axiom’s spacesuits and the availability of new human-rated landers from SpaceX and Blue Origin are driving the timeline for Artemis III.

Rubins is a veteran of two long-duration spaceflights on the International Space Station, logging 300 days in space and conducting four spacewalks totaling nearly 27 hours. She is also an accomplished microbiologist and became the first person to sequence DNA in space.

“What I think we have on the Moon that we don’t really have on the space station that I want people to recognize is an extreme physical stress,” Rubins said. “On the space station, most of the time you’re floating around. You’re pretty happy. It’s very relaxed. You can do exercise. Every now and then, you do an EVA (Extravehicular Activity, or spacewalk).”

“When we get to the lunar surface, people are going to be sleep shifting,” Rubins said. “They’re barely going to get any sleep. They’re going to be in these suits for eight or nine hours. They’re going to be doing EVAs every day. The EVAs that I did on my flights, it was like doing a marathon and then doing another marathon when you were done.”

Rubins is now a professor of computational and systems biology at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine. She said treks on the Moon will be “even more challenging” than her spacewalks outside the ISS.

The Axiom spacesuit design builds on NASA’s own work developing a prototype suit to replace the agency’s decades-old Extravehicular Mobility Units (EMUs) used for spacewalks at the International Space Station (ISS). The new suits allow for greater mobility, with more flexible joints to help astronauts use their legs, crouch, and bend down—things they don’t have to do when floating outside the ISS.

Astronauts on the Moon also must contend with gravity. Including a life-support backpack, the commercial suit weighs more than 300 pounds in Earth’s gravity, but Axiom considers the exact number proprietary. The Axiom suit is considerably heavier than the 185-pound spacesuit the Apollo astronauts wore on the Moon. NASA’s earlier prototype exploration spacesuit was estimated to weigh more than 400 pounds, according to a 2021 report by NASA’s inspector general.

“We’ve definitely seen trauma from the suits, from the actual EVA suit accommodation,” said Mike Barratt, a NASA astronaut and medical doctor. “That’s everything from skin abrasions to joint pain to—no kidding—orthopedic trauma. You can potentially get a fracture of sorts. EVAs on the lunar surface with a heavily loaded suit and heavy loads that you’re either carrying or tools that you’re reacting against, that’s an issue.”

On paper, the Axiom suits for NASA’s Artemis missions are more capable than the Apollo suits. They can support longer spacewalks and provide greater redundancy, and they’re made of modern materials to enhance flexibility and crew comfort. But the new suits are heavier, and for astronauts used to spacewalks outside the ISS, walks on the Moon will be a slog, Rubins said.

“I think the suits are better than Apollo, but I don’t think they are great right now,” Rubins said. “They still have a lot of flexibility issues. Bending down to pick up rocks is hard. The center of gravity is an issue. People are going to be falling over. I think when we say these suits aren’t bad, it’s because the suits have been so horrible that when we get something slightly less than horrible, we get all excited and we celebrate.”

The heavier lunar suits developed for Artemis missions run counter to advice from former astronaut Harrison “Jack” Schmitt, who spent 22 hours walking on the Moon during NASA’s Apollo 17 mission in 1972.

“I’d have that go about four times the mobility, at least four times the mobility, and half the weight,” Schmitt said in a NASA oral history interview in 2000. “Now, one way you can… reduce the weight is carry less consumables and learn to use consumables that you have in some other vehicle, like a lunar rover. Any time you’re on the rover, you hook into those consumables and live off of those, and then when you get off, you live off of what’s in your backpack. We, of course, just had the consumables in our backpack.”

NASA won’t have a rover on the first Artemis landing mission. That will come on a later flight. A fully pressurized vehicle for astronauts to drive across the Moon may be ready sometime in the 2030s. Until then, Moonwalkers will have to tough it out.

“I do crossfit. I do triathlons. I do marathons. I get out of a session in the pool in the NBL (Neutral Buoyancy Laboratory) doing the lunar suit underwater, and I just want to go home and take a nap,” Rubins told the panel. “I am absolutely spent. You’re bruised. This is an extreme physical event in a way that the space station is not.”

Barratt met with the same National Academies panel this week and presented a few hours before Rubins. The committee was chartered to examine how human explorers can enable scientific discovery at sites across the lunar surface. Barratt had a more favorable take on the spacesuit situation.

“This is not a commercial for Axiom. I don’t promote anyone, but their suit is getting there,” Barratt said. “We’ve got 700 hours of pressurized experience in it right now. We do a lot of tests in the NBL, and there are techniques and body conditioning that you do to help you get ready for doing things like this. Bending down in the suit is really not too bad at all.”

Rubins and Barratt did not discuss the schedule for when Axiom’s lunar spacesuit will be ready to fly to the Moon, but the conversation illuminated the innumerable struggles of spacewalking, Moonwalking, and the training astronauts undergo to prepare for extravehicular outings.

I spoke directly with Rubins after her discussion with the National Academies. Her last assignment at NASA was as chief of the EVA and robotics branch in the astronaut office, where she assisted in the development of the new lunar spacesuits. I asked about her experiences testing the lunar suit and her thoughts on how astronauts should prepare for Moonwalks.

“The suits that we have are definitely much better than Apollo,” Rubins said in the interview. “They were just big bags of air. The joints aren’t in there, so it was harder to move. What they did have going for them was that they were much, much lighter than our current spacesuits. We have added a lot of the joints back, and that does get some mobility for us. But at the end of the day, the suits are still quite heavy.”

You can divide the weight of the suit by six to get an idea of how it might feel to carry it around on the lunar surface. While it won’t feel like 300 pounds, astronauts will still have to account for their mass and momentum.

Instead of kind of floating in microgravity and moving your mass around with your hands and your arms, now we’re ambulating. We’re walking with our legs. You’re going to have more strain on your knees and your hips. Your hamstrings, your calves, and your glutes are going to come more into play.

I think, overall, it may be a better fit for humans physically because if you ask somebody to do a task, I’m going to be much better at a task if I can use my legs and I’m ambulating. Then I have to pull myself along with my arms… We’re not really built to do that, but we are built to run and to go long distances. Our legs are just such a powerful force.

So I think there are a lot of things lining up that are going to make the physiology easier. Then there are things that are going to be different because we’re now in a partial gravity environment. We’re going to be bending, we’re going to be twisting, we’re going to be doing different things.

It’s an incredibly hard engineering challenge. You have to keep a human alive in absolute vacuum, warm at temperatures that you know in the polar regions could go as far down as 40 Kelvin (minus 388° Fahrenheit). We haven’t sent humans anywhere that cold before. They are also going to be very hot. They’re going to be baking in the sunshine. You’ve got radiation. If you put all that together, that’s a huge amount of suit material just to keep the human physiology and the human body intact.

Then our challenge is ‘how do you make that mobile?’ It’s very difficult to bend down and pick up a rock. You have to manage that center of gravity because you’re wearing that big life support system on your back, a big pack that has a lot of mass in it, so that brings your center of gravity higher than you’re used to on Earth and a little bit farther backward.

When you move around, it’s like wearing a really, really heavy backpack that has mass but no weight, so it’s going to kind of tip you back. You can do some things with putting weights on the front of the suit to try to move that center of gravity forward, but it’s still higher, and it’s not exactly at your center of mass that you’re used to on the Earth. On the Earth, we have a center of our mass related to gravity, and nobody ever thinks about it, and you don’t think about it until it moves somewhere else, and then it makes all of your natural motion seem very difficult.

Those are some of the challenges that we’re facing engineering-wise. I think the new suits, they’ve gone a long way toward addressing these, but it’s still a hard engineering challenge. And I’m not talking about any specific suit. I can’t talk about the details of the provider’s suits. This is the NASA xEMU and all the lunar suits I have tested over the years. That includes the Mark III suit, the Axiom suit. They have similar issues. So this isn’t really anything about a specific vendor. These are just the difficulties of designing a spacesuit for the lunar environment.

NASA trains astronauts for spacewalks in the Neutral Buoyancy Laboratory, an enormous pool in Houston used for simulating weightlessness. They also use a gravity-offloading device to rehearse the basics of spacewalking. The optimal test environment, short of the space environment itself, will be aboard parabolic flights, where suit developers and astronauts can get the best feel for the suit’s momentum, according to Rubins.

Axiom and NASA are well along assessing the new lunar spacesuit’s performance underwater, but they haven’t put it through reduced-gravity flight testing. “Until you get to the actual parabolic flight, that’s when you can really test the ability to manage this momentum,” Rubins said.

Recovering from a fall on the lunar surface comes with its own perils.

“You’re face down on the lunar surface, and you have to do the most massive, powerful push up to launch you and the entire mass of the suit up off the surface, high enough so you can then flip your legs under you and catch the ground,” Rubins said. “You basically have to kind of do a jumping pushup… This is a risky maneuver we test a whole bunch in training. It’s really non-trivial.”

The lunar suits are sleeker than the suits NASA uses on the ISS, but they are still bulky. “If you’re trying to kneel, if you’re thinking about bending forward at your waist, all that material in your waist has nowhere to go, so it just compresses and compresses,” Rubins said. “That’s why I say it’s harder to kneel. It’s harder to bend forward because you’re having to compress the suit in those areas.

“We’ve done these amazing things with joint mobility,” Rubins said. “The mobility around the joints is amazing… but now we’re dealing with this compression issue. And there’s not an obvious engineering fix to that.”

The fix to this problem might come in the form of tools instead of changes to the spacesuit itself. Rubins said astronauts could use a staff, or something like a hiking pole, to brace themselves when they need to kneel or bend down. “That way I’m not trying to compress the suit and deal with my balance at the same time.”

The Moonwalker suit can comfortably accommodate a wider range of astronauts than NASA’s existing EMUs on the space station. The old EMUs can be resized to medium, large, and extra-large, but that leaves gaps and makes the experience uncomfortable for a smaller astronaut. This discomfort is especially noticeable while practicing for spacewalks underwater, where the tug of gravity is still present, Rubins said.

“As a female, I never really had an EMU that fit me,” Rubins said. “It was always giant. When I’m translating around or doing something, I’m physically falling and slamming myself, my chest or my back, into one side of the suit or the other underwater, whereas with the lunar suit, I’ve got a suit that fits me right. That’s going to lead to less bruising. Just having a suit that fits you is much better.”

Mission planners should also emphasize physical conditioning for astronauts assigned to lunar landing missions. That includes preflight weight and endurance training, plus guidance on what to eat in space to maximize energy levels before astronauts head outside for a stroll.

“That human has to go up really maximally conditioned,” Rubins said.

Rubins and Barratt agreed that NASA and its spacesuit provider should be ready to rapidly respond to feedback from future Moonwalkers. Engineers modified and upgraded the Apollo spacesuits in a matter of months, iterating the design between each mission.

“Our general design is on a good path,” Rubins said. “We need to make sure that we continue to push for increasing improvements in human performance, and some of that ties back to the budget. Our first suit design is not where we’re going to be done if we want to do a really sustained lunar program. We have to continue to improve, and I think it’s important to recognize that we’re going to learn so many lessons during Artemis III.”

Barratt has a unique perspective on spacesuit design. He has performed spacewalks at the ISS in NASA’s spacesuit and the Russian Orlan spacesuit. Barratt said the US suit is easier to work in than the Orlan, but the Russian suit is “incredibly reliable” and “incredibly serviceable.”

“It had a couple of glitches, and literally, you unzip a curtain and it’s like looking at my old Chevy Blazer,” Barratt said. “Everything is right there. It’s mechanical, it’s accessible with standard tools. We can fix it. We can do that really easily. We’ve tried to incorporate those lessons learned into our next-generation EVA systems.”

Contrast that with the NASA suits on the ISS, where one of Barratt’s spacewalks in 2024 was cut short by a spacesuit water leak. “We recently had to return a suit from the space station,” Barratt said. “We’ve got another one that’s sort of offline for a while; we’re troubleshooting it. It’s a really subtle problem that’s extremely difficult to work on in places that are hard to access.”

Harrison Schmitt, speaking with a NASA interviewer in 2000, said his productivity in the Apollo suit “couldn’t have been much more than 10 percent of what you would do normally here on Earth.”

“You take the human brain, the human eyes, and the human hands into space. That’s the only justification you have for having human beings in space,” Schmitt said. “It’s a massive justification, but that’s what you want to use, and all three have distinct benefits in productivity and in gathering new information and infusing data over any automated system. Unfortunately, we have discarded one of those, and that is the hands.”

Schmitt singled out the gloves as the “biggest problem” with the Apollo suits. “The gloves are balloons, and they’re made to fit,” he said. Picking something up with a firm grip requires squeezing against the pressure inside the suit. The gloves can also damage astronauts’ fingernails.

“That squeezing against that pressure causes these forearm muscles to fatigue very rapidly,” Schmitt said. “Just imagine squeezing a tennis ball continuously for eight hours or 10 hours, and that’s what you’re talking about.”

Barratt recounted a conversation in which Schmitt, now 90, said he wouldn’t have wanted to do another spacewalk after his three excursions with commander Gene Cernan on Apollo 17.

“Physically, and from a suit-maintenance standpoint, he thought that that was probably the limit, what they did,” Barratt said. “They were embedded with dust. The visors were abraded. Every time they brushed the dust off the visors, they lost visibility.”

Getting the Artemis spacesuit right is vital to the program’s success. You don’t want to travel all the way to the Moon and stop exploring because of sore fingers or an injured knee.

“If you look at what we’re spending on suits versus what we’re spending on the rocket, this is a pretty small amount,” Rubins said. “Obviously, the rocket can kill you very quickly. That needs to be done right. But the continuous improvement in the suit will get us that much more efficiency. Saving 30 minutes or an hour on the Moon, that gives you that much more science.”

“Once you have safely landed on the lunar surface, this is where you’ve got to put your money,” Barratt said.</div>

            <h2>Trump Forgets the Word for Alzheimer’s Disease While Insisting That He Doesn’t Have It</h2>
            <p><strong>Futurism | 2026-01-26</strong></p>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Experts have long questioned president Donald Trump’s claims of having a clean bill of health. He has been spotted with swollen ankles and dark bruises on both of his hands, which experts argue could be a sign that he’s receiving frequent intravenous treatments.

His mental acuity has also been called into question, with critics pointing to his slurred speech, nonsensical rants, and lapses in memory.

Case in point, in a recently published interview with New York Magazine, Trump struggled to recall the name of Alzheimer’s disease — a particularly dark blunder, considering the condition is characterized by progressive memory loss, and Trump has a family history of it.

When discussing his father, Fred Trump, he struggled to remember what the disease was called.

“He had one problem. At a certain age, about 86, 87, he started getting… what do they call it?” he pondered during the video.

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt came to his rescue.

“Like an Alzheimer’s thing,” the president continued. “Well, I don’t have it.”

When asked if the disease is “something you think about at all,” Trump was vehement in his denial, but once again struggled to sound coherent.

“No, I don’t think about it at all,” he said. “You know why? Because whatever it is, my attitude is whatever.”

Swirling questions about Trump’s cognitive condition have clearly frustrated the 79-year-old. During baffling remarks from the Oval Office earlier this month, made after signing a bipartisan Whole Milk for Healthy Kids Act, Trump boasted that a penchant for dairy had allowed him to “ace” all of his cognitive tests.

“I’ve aced every one of them because I drink milk,” he said.

He also boasted about passing cognitive tests on January 2 and December 9, suggesting that his neurological condition has been evaluated frequently in recent months. (He’s discussed the topic for years now, claiming to have achieved a top score on the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), a 30-point cognitive screening tool to detect cognitive impairment, back in 2018.)

Also concerning is his family history. Fred Trump died at the age of 93 in 1999, after struggling with the disease for almost a decade.

Adding to Trump’s optics conundrum around his health, his top staff often defends his physical and mental health in terms so strong that it can be unintentionally comical.

Leavitt, for instance, insisted to NY Mag that the “Marine sentries who stand outside the Oval Office, they had to request more staff and bring up more Marines because the president is in the Oval Office so much.”

“They’ve never had to do that before,” she said. “They had to request more guys to stand by the door because they are running out of men to fill the shifts.”

“He’s working harder now than he did in his entire life,” she told the magazine. “Even in real estate when he was on top of the world in New York.”

            <h2>Scientists Investigating 2,000-Year-Old Artifact That Appears to Be a Battery</h2>
            <p><strong>Futurism | 2026-01-26</strong></p>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">A 2,000 year old battery, or just a very interesting pot?

This is the debate that’s been swirling over the fragments of a puzzling artifact discovered in Iraq nearly a century ago. Dubbed the “Baghdad battery,” it’s believed to have originally been a clay jar housing a copper vessel, at the center of which was an iron rod. This arrangement, either by coincidence or design, could’ve allowed it to function as a primitive galvanic cell, some archaeologists argue — a primitive energy storage device pioneered in the Western world by Alessandro Volta, after whom the “volt” was named.

These are tough claims to bear out, not least of all because the original artifact has been lost since the US’s invasion of Iraq in 2003. As such, archaeologists have had to rely on reconstructing the strange vessel based on records to try to tease out its origins.

Now a new study highlighted by Chemistry World purports that the Baghdad battery wasn’t just a battery, but one that was capable of outputting much more power than once believed.

“If this artefact were truly a battery — and I could be wrong of course — then my experiment shows the most effective and convenient way it could have been used as one,” the author, independent researcher Alexander Bazes, told the outlet.

Skeptics argue that the artifact, in its suspected arrangement, would’ve outputted too puny an amount of power to have intentionally been a battery.

Bazes’s reconstruction argues otherwise. His experiments suggests that the clay jar’s porous exterior acted like a separator between an electrolyte, perhaps lye, and air, which connected with the copper vessel to create an outer cell. Meanwhile, the iron rod inside the copper vessel acted as an inner cell, creating an electrical series that could’ve produced 1.4 volts of electricity — approximately the same voltage of a modern AA battery.

Still, Bazes doesn’t buy the argument purported by some fringe archaeologists that the battery’s copper vessel would’ve been used to electroplate jewelry, or coat them in a thin layer of metal. Instead, he argues the Baghdad battery may have been used to “ritually corrode” prayers written on paper, as witnessing the corrosion would’ve been seen as “visual evidence of an energetic influence having passed through their prayer,” Bazes wrote in the study.

Or maybe it wasn’t a battery at all, counters University of Pennsylvania archaeologist William Hafford, who has extensively researched the artifact. In reality, it was likely a sacred jar for storing prayers, he told Chemistry World, noting that other magic items like it have been found buried nearby, including a similar clay jar with ten copper vessels, which is obviously too many to form a battery. The iron rod that supposedly acted as an electrode for the inner battery cell were really just iron nails that were part of the magical ritual.

“You would drop the prayer through the neck of the jar, seal it with bitumen and then bury it with a ritual,” Hafford told the outlet. “They were usually buried in the ground because you were giving them to the chthonic deities.”

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">As much of North America is still recovering from a devastating winter storm over the weekend, other parts of the globe have already been through much worse.

Consider the Kamchatka Peninsula, a Russian territory that reaches into the Pacific Ocean north-east of Japan, which has been battling with record amounts of snow this winter. On January 16 alone, a small city on the peninsula’s southern coast, called Petropavlovsk-Kamchatskiy, experienced a baffling five and a half feet of snow, effectively burying local residents and their cars completely. Some areas saw more than six and a half feet in just the first half of January.

One video that went viral on social media last week shows a local resident jumping out of his window several stories up, only to land in a deep blanket of snow below. A time-lapse recorded by a CCTV camera shows entire cars being buried in a matter of hours, forcing residents to shovel narrow channels just to get down the block.

According to the Russian state-operated news agency RIA Novosti, it was the most snowfall in the peninsula the Kamchatka hydrometeorology department has seen in about 60 years. Satellite images highlighted by NASA show the peninsula being buried by snow, turning it into a white snowball that can easily be spotted from space.

Yet as the New York Times reports, AI-generated videos have added to the confusion, showing unrealistic apocalyptic scenes. One fake clip, for instance, shows residents sliding down massive ramps of snow that reach the top of ten-story apartment blocks.

Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky local Andrey Stepanchuk told the NYT that many of the videos circulating online were not real, describing the situation as “nothing catastrophic.”

Apart from record amounts of snow, the region had to deal with other kinds of natural disasters as well. After all, per NASA, it’s the most volcanically active region in the entire world.

Case in point, Kamchatka was struck by a magnitude 8.8 earthquake last summer, the sixth largest on record since 1900. Just weeks later, the Krasheninnikov volcano near the east coast erupted for the first time in “at least 400 years.”

In short, Kamchatka’s experiences with the brute force of Mother Nature really put the latest snowstorm blanketing much of the United States and Canada into perspective.

            <div id="article-text">Generative AI relies on a massive body of training material, primarily made up of human-authored content haphazardly scraped from the internet.

Scientists are still trying to better understand what will happen when these AI models run out of that content and have to rely on synthetic, AI-generated data instead, closing a potentially dangerous loop. Studies have found that AI models start cannibalizing this AI-generated data, which can eventually turn their neural networks into mush. As the AI iterates on recycled content, it starts to spit out increasingly bland and often mangled outputs.

There’s also the question of what will happen to human culture as AI systems digest and produce AI content ad infinitum. As AI executives promise that their models are capable enough to replace creative jobs, what will future models be trained on?

In an insightful new study published in the journal Patterns this month, an international team of researchers found that a text-to-image generator, when linked up with an image-to-text system and instructed to iterate over and over again, eventually converges on “very generic-looking images” they dubbed “visual elevator music.”

“This finding reveals that, even without additional training, autonomous AI feedback loops naturally drift toward common attractors,” they wrote. “Human-AI collaboration, rather than fully autonomous creation, may be essential to preserve variety and surprise in the increasingly machine-generated creative landscape.”

As Rutgers University professor of computer science Ahmed Elgammal writes in an essay about the work for The Conversation, it’s yet another piece of evidence that generative AI may already be inducing a state of “cultural stagnation.”

The recent study shows that “generative AI systems themselves tend toward homogenization when used autonomously and repeatedly,” he argued. “They even suggest that AI systems are currently operating in this way by default.”

“The convergence to a set of bland, stock images happened without retraining,” Elgammal added. “No new data was added. Nothing was learned. The collapse emerged purely from repeated use.”

It’s a particularly alarming predicament considering the tidal wave of AI slop drowning out human-made content on the internet. While proponents of AI argue that humans will always be the “final arbiter of creative decisions,” per Elgammal, algorithms are already starting to float AI-generated content to the top, a homogenization that could greatly hamper creativity.

“The risk is not only that future models might train on AI-generated content, but that AI-mediated culture is already being filtered in ways that favor the familiar, the describable and the conventional,” the researcher wrote.

It remains to be seen to what degree existing creative outlets, from photography to theater, will be affected by the advent of generative AI, or whether they can coexist peacefully.

Nonetheless, it’s an alarming trend that needs to be addressed. Elgammal argued that to stop this process of cultural stagnation, AI models need to be encouraged or incentivized to “deviate from the norms.”

“If generative AI is to enrich culture rather than flatten it, I think systems need to be designed in ways that resist convergence toward statistically average outputs,” he concluded. “The study makes one thing clear: Absent these interventions, generative AI will continue to drift toward mediocre and uninspired content.”

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Meta says it’s cutting off teenagers’ access to its AI characters — at least until it can build “better” ones.

The Mark Zuckerberg company announced the change on Friday, signaling at least some degree of hesitation at the company over how young users are engaging with its chatbots amid mounting concern over the tech’s effects on mental health and safety.

“Starting in the coming weeks, teens will no longer be able to access AI characters across our apps until the updated experience is ready,” Meta said in an updated blog post. “This will apply to anyone who has given us a teen birthday, as well as people who claim to be adults but who we suspect are teens based on our age prediction technology.”

The update follows an announcement from Meta in October, when it said that parents would be able to use new tools for supervising their children’s interactions with AI characters, including the  ability to cut off their access to the characters entirely. The announcement also described a feature that would provide parents “insights” about the topics their teens were discussing in the AI conversations.

Meta originally promised to release these tools early this year, but that hasn’t come to pass. Now, in its new announcement, the company is saying that it’s building a “new version” of AI characters to “give people an even better experience,” so it’s developing the promised safety tools from scratch and cutting off teen access in the meantime.

Concerns over teenage use of AI chatbots has fueled the broader conversation around AI safety and the phenomenon of AI psychosis, the term some experts are using to describe delusional mental health spirals that are encouraged by an AI’s sycophantic responses. Numerous cases have ended in suicide, many of them being teenagers. The bots remain wildly popular, with one survey finding that one in five high schoolers in the US say they or a friend have had a romantic relationship with an AI.

Meta has come under particular scrutiny, with an internal document allowing underage kids to have “sensual” conversations with its AI — and chatbots based on celebrities including John Cena having wildly inappropriate sexual conversations with users who identified themselves as young teens.

Meta isn’t the only chatbot platform to buckle under scrutiny. The website Character.AI, which offers AI companions similar to Meta’s and was popular with teams, banned minors from the platform last October, after being sued by several families who accused the company’s chatbots of encouraging their children to take their own lives.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">A months-old but until now overlooked study recently featured in Wired claims to mathematically prove that large language models “are incapable of carrying out computational and agentic tasks beyond a certain complexity” — that level of complexity being, crucially, pretty low.

The paper, which has not been peer reviewed, was written by Vishal Sikka, a former CTO at the German software giant SAP, and his son Varin Sikka. Sikka senior knows a thing or two about AI: he studied under John McCarthy, the Turing Award-winning computer scientist who literally founded the entire field of artificial intelligence, and in fact helped coin the very term.

“There is no way they can be reliable,” Vishal Sikka told Wired.

When asked by the interviewer, Sikka also agreed that we should forget about AI agents running nuclear power plants and other strident promises thrown around by AI boosters.

Ignore the rhetoric that tech CEOs spew onstage and pay attention to what the researchers that work for them are finding, and you’ll find that even the AI industry agrees that the tech has some fundamental limitations baked into its architecture. In September, for example, OpenAI scientists admitted that AI hallucinations, in which LLMs confidently make up facts, were still a pervasive problem even in increasingly advanced systems, and that model accuracy would “never” reach 100 percent.

That would seemingly put a big dent in the feasibility of so-called AI agents, which are models designed to autonomously carry out tasks without human intervention, and which the industry universally decided last year would be its next big thing. Some companies that embraced AI agents to downsize their workforces quickly realized that the agents they weren’t anywhere near good enough to replace the outgoing humans, perhaps because they hallucinated so much and could barely complete any of the tasks given to them.

AI leaders insist that stronger guardrails external to the AI models can filter out the hallucinations. They may always be prone to hallucinating, but if these slip-ups are rare enough, then eventually companies will trust them to start doing tasks that they once entrusted to flesh and blood grunts. In the same paper that OpenAI researchers conceded that the models would never reach perfect accuracy, they also dismissed the idea that hallucinations are “inevitable,” because LLMs “can abstain when uncertain.” (Despite that, you’d be hard-pressed to find a single popular chatbot that actually does that, almost certainly because it would make the chatbots seem less impressive and less engaging to use.)

Even though he’s adamant LLMs have a hard ceiling, Sikka agrees with figures in the AI industry who insist that hallucinations can be reined in.

“Our paper is saying that a pure LLM has this inherent limitation — but at the same time it is true that you can build components around LLMs that overcome those limitations,” he told Wired.

            <h2>AI startup CVector raises $5M for its industrial ‘nervous system’</h2>
            <p><strong>TechCrunch | 2026-01-26</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/26/ai-startup-cvector-raises-5m-for-its-industrial-nervous-system/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Industrial AI startup CVector built a brain and nervous system for big industry. Now, founders Richard Zhang and Tyler Ruggles are tasked with a bigger challenge: showing customers and investors how this AI-powered software layer translates to real savings on an industrial scale.

The New York-based startup has had some success following its pre-seed funding round last July. Its system is now running with real customers, including public utilities, advanced manufacturing facilities, and chemical producers. It’s given the duo more concrete examples of what problems they can solve — and money they can save — for their big industry clients

“One of the core things we’re witnessing,” he said, is customers “really lack the tool to translate a small action, like turning on and off a valve, [into] did that just save me money?”

As a homeowner with bills to pay, it’s a bit unnerving to think about one nondescript valve making such a big difference in the bottom line of a company and its customers. But it’s examples like this that helped CVector reach a new milestone, as it has now closed a $5 million seed round, Zhang and Ruggles told TechCrunch.

The financing was led by Powerhouse Ventures and included a mix of venture and strategic backing, with participation from early stage funds like Fusion Fund and Myriad Venture Partners, as well as Hitachi’s corporate venture arm.

With the funding round closed, CVector is talking a bit more about some of its first customers — and just how different they are.

“The joy of the last, say, six to eight months has been going to the industrial heartland, to all of these places that are just in the middle of nowhere, but have massive production plants that are either reinventing themselves or really transforming how they make decisions,” Zhang said in an interview.

One of those customers is a metals processing company based in Iowa called ATEK Metal Technologies, which makes aluminum castings for Harley-Davidson motorcycles, among other things. CVector is doing things like helping spot potential problems that could lead to equipment downtime, monitor the whole plant’s energy efficiency, and keep an eye on commodity prices that impact raw material cost.

“That is, to me, such a good example where this is really skilled labor, and they will need all the help they can get from for us, from the software side, from technology side, to really help that group of people transform, take the business to the next level so they can keep growing,” Zhang said.

Finding optimizations in older plants might seem like the most obvious path for a company like CVector. But it has also picked up startups as customers, too, including Ammobia, a materials science startup based in San Francisco that is working to lower the cost of making ammonia. And yet the work CVector is doing for Ammobia is surprisingly similar to what it’s doing for ATEK, Zhang said.

CVector is also growing. The company is up to 12 people, and it’s locked down its first physical office in the financial district in Manhattan. Zhang said he’s been attracting talent from the worlds of fintech and finance, especially hedge funds. The latter is ripe for recruiting, he said, since the people who work in the hedge fund industry are already pretty focused on using data to gain a financial edge.

“That’s the core of our sales pitch, it’s what we call ‘operational economics,’” Zhang said. “We position it to sit between the operation of the plant and the actual economics — the margin of how much you’re making money.”

Zhang still sees public utilities as a great place to apply CVector’s technology, though. (That’s where the valve example came from.) And he’s found that even these types of customers have become far more fluent in talking about the kinds of work CVector does.

“Tyler and I were just talking about how when we first started company almost exactly a year ago, it was still like a taboo to talk about AI in general. There was a 50/50 chance if the customer would embrace AI or just kind of discredit you, right?” he said. “But now, over the especially last six months, everyone is asking for more AI-native solutions, even when sometimes the ROI calculation might not be clear. This kind of adoption craze is real.”

Ruggles said that’s in large part because what CVector does ultimately comes down to one thing: money. And with so much uncertainty in the world, managing costs has only gotten harder.

“We’re at this time when companies are really intimately worried about their supply chain and the costs and variability there, and being able to kind of layer AI on top [to make] economic model of a facility, it’s really resonated with a lot of customers, whether it’s old and industrial in the heartland, or whether it’s new energy producers who are trying to do new and novel things,” he said.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Skylight, a TikTok alternative built on open source technology, is benefiting from concerns that arose over TikTok U.S.’s change in ownership last week. The startup, a maker of a short-form, vertical video app similar to TikTok, says it has now topped over 380,000 users and is continuing to grow after a busy weekend.

Launched last year and backed by Mark Cuban and other investors, Skylight’s mobile app is built on the AT Protocol, the technology that also powers the decentralized X rival, Bluesky, which now has north of 42 million users.

Skylight, co-founded by CEO Tori White and CTO Reed Harmeyer, offers a built-in video editor, user profiles, support for likes, commenting, and sharing, and the ability for community curators to create custom feeds for others to follow.

The app now has over 150,000 videos uploaded directly to the platform. It can also stream videos from Bluesky because of its AT Protocol integration.

Harmeyer said Saturday that 1.4 million videos were played on the app the day before, up 3x over the past 24 hours. The app had also seen signups increase more than 150%. Other noteworthy stats include over a 50% increase in returning users, over 40% rise in video played on average, and over 100% increase in posts created.

This surge was likely triggered by concerns over TikTok’s change in ownership and its unfortunately timed technical glitches.

TikTok had announced on January 22 the establishment of the TikTok USDS Joint Venture LLC, designed to comply with Trump’s executive order requiring the company’s U.S. operations be sold to a group of American investors. TikTok’s Chinese parent ByteDance will now own less than 20% of the new entity.

The deal was a result of increased tensions between the U.S. and China, which led to concerns that TikTok could be a threat to national security, both by collecting data on U.S. citizens and through algorithmic influence. Now, however, some of TikTok’s users are more worried about the new American investors and their allegiance to Trump.

Those concerns grew to a head when TikTok pushed out an updated privacy policy, which includes permission to track users’ GPS coordinates, among other things. Users also pointed to language in the privacy policy that said the app would track immigration status. Although that language was not new, and its inclusion has to do with adherence to state privacy laws, some users began encouraging people to delete the app.

While it’s unknown how many TikTok users actually followed through, what is clear is that some people sought out alternatives. Over the weekend, Skylight’s CEO Tori White said the app added around 20,000 new users and is continuing to grow. So far this January, the app has seen around 95,000 monthly active users.

White credited the app’s more open and customizable nature as the force behind its growth.

While Skylight has made notable gains, it’s still overshadowed by TikTok and its 200 million monthly active U.S. users. Still, Skylight’s founders believe their approach provides an opening for growth.

“We’ve seen what happens when one person dictates what’s pushed into people’s feeds,” White told TechCrunch. “Not only does it harm a creator’s connection with their followers, but the entire health of the platform. That’s why we built Skylight Social on open standards. We wanted creator and user power to be guaranteed by the technology. Not an empty promise, but an irrevocable right.”

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Claude users will now be able to call up interactive apps within the chatbot interface, thanks to a new feature announced by Anthropic on Monday.

In keeping with Anthropic’s enterprise focus, the launch apps are mostly workplace tools, including Slack, Canva, Figma, Box, and Clay, with a Salesforce implementation expected soon. In each case, the app will enable a logged-in instance of the service that’s accessible to Claude, enabling users to send Slack messages, generate charts, or access cloud files, depending on which apps have been enabled.

“Analyzing data, designing content, and managing projects all work better with a dedicated visual interface,” Anthropic said in a blog post announcing the feature. “Combined with Claude’s intelligence, you can work and iterate faster than either could offer alone.”

The new feature is available to Pro, Max, Team, and Enterprise subscribers, but not free users. Eligible users can activate the tools at claude.ai/directory.

The system is similar to OpenAI’s Apps system, which launched in October and also enables interactive third-party tools. Both systems of app integrations are built on the Model Context Protocol, an open standard introduced by Anthropic in 2024. MCP launched support for apps in November, drawing on work from both companies.

The new apps will be particularly powerful when integrated with Claude Cowork, an all-purpose agent tool launched by Anthropic last week. Built on top of Claude Code, Cowork lets users assign multi-stage tasks that draw on large and open-ended datasets — tasks that would have previously required terminal commands. Combined with the new apps feature, Cowork could be granted access to cloud files or ongoing work projects. For example, Cowork could update a marketing graphic in Figma or use new data from the company’s Box instance.

Apps are not available in Cowork at launch, but Anthropic said the integration would be “coming soon.”

Agentic systems can be unpredictable, and Anthropic’s own safety documentation for Cowork encourages users to monitor the agent closely and not grant any unnecessary permissions.

“Be cautious about granting access to sensitive information like financial documents, credentials, or personal records,” the company recommends. “Consider creating a dedicated working folder for Claude rather than granting broad access.”

            <p><strong>TechCrunch | 2026-01-26</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/26/obvious-ventures-lands-fund-five-with-a-360-degree-view-of-planetary-human-economic-health/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Obvious Ventures, the firm co-founded by Twitter’s Evan Williams, has raised a fifth fund, and this one, just like its predecessors, comes with a “fun” number: $360,360,360.

“We invest in the frontiers of math and science and physics, and we like to celebrate math in our fund numbers as well,” James Joaquin (pictured far right), the firm’s co-founder and managing director, told TechCrunch.

The firm’s first fund was $123,456,789, and the second was $191,919,191 (a palindromic number that reads the same forward and backwards). The third was $271,828,182 (which mathematicians and engineers instantly recognize as e, or Euler’s number), while the fourth fund, announced in mid-2022, continued the tradition as another palindrome at $355,111,553.

If you haven’t guessed it by now, the meaning of Obvious Ventures newest fund size is a little less about geeky math and more about the firm’s investing philosophy. Twelve years into its journey, Obvious says the figure represents a full-circle perspective on its three broad focus areas: planetary health, human health, and economic health.

“We love the metaphor of taking a 360-degree view in each of those areas,” Joaquin said. “You have to be a student of the past to understand what’s worked and what hasn’t worked.”

What’s working for the firm, according to Joaquin, is keeping its fund sizes small enough so that a single investment, if it becomes a durable public company, has the opportunity to return the entire fund. Joaquin likely placed an emphasis on durability in part because Obvious Venture’s initial winners, Beyond Meat, reached a market capitalization of over $14 billion shortly after its 2019 IPO, but had fallen to below a billion by late 2022.

Still, Joaquin says the firm has seen meaningful cash distributions to limited partners from all of its core funds, and it boasts several companies with successful public-market exits. In 2015, Obvious Ventures invested in the satellite imagery company Planet Labs, which went public via a SPAC in 2021 and is currently valued at approximately $8.5 billion. Meanwhile, its Series A investment in Recursion Pharmaceuticals maintains a market capitalization of over $2 billion.

Obvious is also an early investor in the HR and payroll platform Gusto, which was most recently valued at more than $9 billion in the private market and is widely considered to be on an IPO trajectory.

In a venture capital environment where only 17% of firms successfully raise more than three funds, per research from Sapphire Partners, Obvious Ventures’ latest fundraise solidifies the firm as an established VC player.

“We made it to fund five, which is actually a big deal in the venture landscape,” Joaquin said.

Obvious Ventures may take a playful approach to fund sizes, but its focus on investing in startups that make a positive impact on the world is serious. Joaquin pointed to several investments in each of the firm’s three pillars.

Within the planetary health sector, the firm invested in Zanskar, a startup using proprietary data and AI to identify and harness geothermal energy, one of the most cost-effective power sources available. Just last week, Zanskar announced a $115 million Series C. Obvious Ventures, which led the company’s previous round, is particularly excited about the investment. Joaquin noted that the geothermal power harnessed by Zanskar can help fuel energy-hungry AI data centers.

In its human health strategy, Obvious Ventures touted its investment in Inceptive, an AI platform for molecule development. Inceptive was founded by Jakob Uszkoreit, one of the primary authors of the seminal “Attention is All You Need” paper, which introduced the transformer architecture, the breakthrough behind generative AI.

In the area of economic health, Joaquin pointed to Dexterity Robotics. The company, which was at $1.65 billion last year, builds humanoids to handle “dull, dirty, and dangerous” jobs tasks currently performed by humans in warehouses and factories.

In addition to Joaquin, Obvious Ventures has four active investors, including co-founder Vishal Vasishth. (Ev Williams remains a co-founder and an adviser.) The firm intends to make approximately 10 investments annually, with check sizes ranging from $5 million to $12 million for Seed and Series A startups.

            <h2>TikTok attributes recent glitches to a power outage at a U.S. data center</h2>
            <p><strong>TechCrunch | 2026-01-26</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/26/tiktok-attributes-recent-glitches-to-a-power-outage-at-a-u-s-data-center/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">As snowstorms pelted the U.S. on Sunday, TikTok users reported widespread issues with the app, like problems loading comments or unexpected behavior from the For You page algorithm. For some users, the problems continue to persist.

The timing of these outages lines up with the long-awaited creation of a separate U.S. TikTok entity last week, which the U.S. government mandated due to concerns about the Chinese government potentially accessing user data via the app’s former parent company, ByteDance. (Now, ByteDance owns less than 20% of the new TikTok USDS Joint Venture, while managing investors Oracle, Silver Lake, and MGX own 15% each).

However, the TikTok USDS Joint Venture stated in a post on X that these issues were caused by a power outage at a U.S. data center.

“Since yesterday we’ve been working to restore our services following a power outage at a U.S. data center impacting TikTok and other apps we operate,” the company said. “We’re working with our data center partner to stabilize our service. We’re sorry for this disruption and hope to resolve it soon.”

Since yesterday we’ve been working to restore our services following a power outage at a U.S. data center impacting TikTok and other apps we operate. We&#39;re working with our data center partner to stabilize our service. We&#39;re sorry for this disruption and hope to resolve it soon.

According to user-reported data from Downdetector, the outage is impacting users across the country.

TikTok’s reasoning for the glitches is logical, given that more than one million people in the U.S. have been impacted by power outages after the massive storm. But some users are suspicious given how soon the outages occurred after the U.S. joint venture was formally established.

The outage also overlaps with ongoing protests in Minneapolis, Minnesota, where thousands of ICE agents have been deployed since early January in what ICE Acting Director Todd Lyons called the “largest immigration operation ever.”

On Saturday, border patrol agents shot and killed Alex Pretti, marking ICE’s second murder of a civilian in Minneapolis this month.

In the wake of the killing, some TikTok users said they had trouble searching on the app for information about the events in Minneapolis. The app malfunctions then led to panic about the possibility of government censorship. However, TikTok attributes these issues to its concurrent data center outage.

People had also expressed concern over the weekend about TikTok’s updated privacy policy, which includes language that allows TikTok to collect data about users, including their “sexual life or sexual orientation, status as transgender or nonbinary, citizenship or immigration status.” However, as TechCrunch reported, some of these disclosures are not new and had appeared in TikTok’s privacy policy prior to the ownership deal’s close, primarily to comply with California’s Consumer Privacy Act.

While the recent TikTok outages and privacy policy changes seem to be run-of-the-mill problems with bad timing, Americans do have reason to be cautious about social media surveillance — especially in times of political unrest.

            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/26/vc-firm-2150-raises-e210m-fund-to-solve-cities-climate-challenges/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">If you want to solve climate change, there are few better places to start than cities.

“The city is kind of like this beautiful vampire squid that sucks in all the resources,” Jacob Bro, co-founder and partner at 2150, told TechCrunch. “They basically aggregate all the prosperity in the world — 80% of GDP — but also 70% of emissions and all the other resources, all the waste, and all the downsides of the good life.”

Plenty of investors have raised large funds to tackle climate change in recent years, with many measuring success by returns and carbon reductions. 2150 does the same, but to find fertile ground for investments, it starts by looking at problems and opportunities in cities, specifically.

“If we look at all the stuff we consume, all the stuff we need to build, to make the urban platform of prosperity operate and thrive, you can identify technologies and the bottlenecks,” Bro said.

The climate angle helps give the fund an edge, he said. “Sustainability, if done well, is just better business, right? It’s cheaper, faster, and more independent from geopolitics.”

That dual focus has helped 2150 raise a new €210 million second fund from a range of institutional investors and family funds, including Chr. Augustinus Fabrikker, Church Pension Group, the Danish sovereign fund EIFO, Fund of Funds Carbon Equity, Novo Holdings, Islandbridge Capital, Security Trading Oy, and Viessmann Generations Group. The new fund brings the European firm’s assets under management to €500 million.

In total, the new fund has 34 limited partners, said Christian Hernandez, co-founder and partner at 2150. “Pretty meaty checks,” he added.

So far, 2150 has invested in seven companies from the new fund, including AtmosZero, which makes industrial heat pumps; GetMobil, an e-waste recycling startup; Metycle, a scrap and recyclable metals marketplace; and MissionZero, a direct air capture startup. Three others have yet to be announced.

In total, 2150 is looking to invest in 20 companies in the second fund. Most startups it writes checks to will be raising Series A rounds, and the checks will total around €5 million to €6 million, Hernandez said. Half of the fund will be reserved for follow-on investments.

The partners said they’ll be looking for a range of startups, similar to before. Specifically, though, they’re excited by opportunities in data centers and automation, both of which have been spurred by the recent surge in AI. But for them, AI is just more than an opportunity to invest in energy-related companies.

“The impact there is more societal than it is climate-related,” Hernandez said. “Europe is expected to lose 100 million people between now and 2040 — just people getting older. The Netherlands already has 50% of their population over the age of 50. So what role does industrial automation help with helping those people be productive, but also generating GDP and funding those people’s pensions?” he said.

Bro said the focus on industrial applications was perhaps obvious in hindsight. “Cities are all supplied by large or small industries at the end of the day,” he said.

The focus appears to be paying off. 2150’s portfolio companies mitigated one megaton of carbon emissions last year, Hernandez said. “The fact that a small venture capital fund can already get to the megaton-level scale in only four years, that level of impact, along with the commercial traction, makes me feel like we’re doing the right thing.”

            <h2>America’s Most Fundamental Values Are at Risk</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-01-26</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/2026/01/policing-open-carry-minnesota-pretti/685767/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Carrying a concealed handgun in public is now commonplace in much of the country. For many, this is not only a prudent act of personal safety, but an expression of liberty and a bulwark against government overreach. At the same time, America&#39;s law-enforcement officers insist they must exercise vigilance while patrolling dangerous streets. When officers make a split-second decision to shoot someone who is carrying a gun, many political leaders, especially on the right, believe they need to be given deference because their lives were at risk.

The tension between these two ideas is acute, putting law enforcement and citizens on a potentially catastrophic collision course. One such collision took place in Minnesota on Saturday. It was fatal for the citizen. And it was potentially delegitimizing for law enforcement. A broader crisis of government legitimacy is imminent in the absence of a change in direction by the Trump administration.

Judging from the video evidence and news reports, this is what seems to have taken place: The Minneapolis nurse Alex Pretti carried his loaded, concealed 9-mm handgun to a protest against the ICE agents.  He had no criminal record, and a permit to carry the gun. Holding only a phone when an agent moved in to make an arrest, he was pepper-sprayed and thrown to the ground. Then, as federal agents wrestled him into submission, Pretti’s coat rode up and his holstered gun came into view. It set off panicked screams of “Gun!” among the agents. One of them reached in and removed the pistol from Pretti’s waistband; another then drew his own pistol and shot Pretti in the back. Pretti died in the street never having touched his gun. He had been disarmed before the first shot was even fired.

In response to this tragedy, the president of the United States wrote on social media: “LET OUR ICE PATRIOTS DO THEIR JOB!”

But surely doing their job well must include respecting the people they serve. For true Second Amendment advocates, Pretti’s decision to bring a gun to a protest in no way excuses his killing. A protester with a gun, they believe, is not courting his own demise. To these advocates, under the Second Amendment, there is no wrong time and place for a citizen to be armed; it is a right that “shall not be infringed.” Some states prohibit guns at protests, but Minnesota is not one of them. As of 2025, more than 20 million Americans held a concealed carry permit. And 29 states have adopted Constitutional Carry, meaning a permit is not required.

Robert F. Worth: Welcome to the American winter

None of this is to say that policing an armed society is easy. It requires highly trained, well-led officers who can navigate incidents including routine calls and crimes in progress with discipline and restraint. It also requires a commitment to transparency—and to accountability, when police wrongly shoot a person exercising their right to carry a gun. In this regard, ICE and the federal government have failed dismally.

ICE agents are poorly screened and quickly hired. They spend just 47 days in their training academy, a shorter duration than nearly all law enforcement organizations; Minnesota, for example, requires about double the training for its police officers at 1,050 hours. In the field, they are saddled with quotas for how many people they must apprehend. That leads to desperate measures and poor decisions. Many of these agents wear masks to conceal their identity and project an air of menace. They regularly flout their own body-camera policy, which their agency is seeking to roll back. They have been instructed to use force to enter homes without the judicial warrant the Constitution requires. They perform poorly at crowd control, resorting to tear gas and pepper spray with an alarming frequency.

Compounding these problems, the federal government has vilified the men and women shot by ICE agents, including U.S. citizens; refused to conduct transparent investigations; and contemptuously blocked state agencies from doing so. Federal officials have declared ICE’s killings lawful and justified over social media without any pretense of a formal review, making statements that are cruel, derogatory, misleading, or simply false. People who want the government to account for what it has done are told to go pound sand.

A particularly vivid example of this dynamic occurred three weeks ago, when an ICE agent, also in Minneapolis, killed Renee Good as she tried to drive away from him. The agency argued that a car on the move is a lethal threat, so an officer who steps in front of a car can shoot a driver who doesn’t stop. The New York City Police Department prohibited shooting at moving vehicles in 1972, and most major cities tightly regulate the practice. Professional police agencies have learned that shooting the driver doesn’t stop the car or make the officer any safer; the best bet is to get out of the way. Rather than explain this contradiction, ICE dismissed criticism, immediately declared Good’s killing necessary and lawful, labeled her a domestic terrorist and the officer a hero, and shut down efforts to investigate the incident. Then the Department of Justice ordered federal prosecutors and the FBI to investigate Good’s family for ties to left-wing radicals, leading several prosecutors to resign. This is not the behavior of government officials who can plausibly argue that they have a legitimate right to use force against citizens.

Contrary to the administration’s feverish claims, the protesters in Minneapolis are not “woke” leftist domestic terrorists confronting responsible law-enforcement officers to foment an insurrection. As best we can tell, among the cast of activists are citizens of every class, ideology, and race, standing up for basic decency and constitutional liberties. One of our mothers-in-law regularly demonstrates against ICE, and she hasn’t protested anything since the Vietnam War. In the face of the dangers posed by armed, masked men who have been reassured by the president that they will receive immunity for their actions—both legally incorrect and a bad idea—these citizens are putting themselves on the line to say that what is happening is inconsistent with America’s most fundamental values.

There is a lot of overlap between the elected officials who exhort Americans to carry guns wherever they like, and the ones who tend to stand by law-enforcement officers who use lethal force. These positions are not always contradictory, but in this situation they are flatly incompatible. If elected officials are going to stump for the Second Amendment, and at the same time refuse to hold a federal agency accountable for killing an American exercising that very right, the country is at risk of losing any right to protest. And the federal government is calling into question its legitimacy.</div>

            <h2>The Worst Thing About the Black Dahlia Case</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-01-26</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/books/2026/01/woman-who-became-black-dahlia/685739/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Elizabeth Short liked to wander. Sometimes this wandering was merely in her mind, watching movies and dreaming of a life far beyond her hometown of Medford, Massachusetts. Many times, it was physical; she’d land in a new city—Miami, Jacksonville, Chicago, Long Beach, San Diego, Los Angeles—and explore its streets on foot. Sometimes her travels revolved around family, as when she tracked down her long-lost father and lived with him for a time—until he cast her out. On January 9, 1947, Short, who was 22, told a gentleman friend to drop her off at the Biltmore Hotel in downtown Los Angeles, where her sister was supposedly waiting. She was never seen alive again.

A contemporary version of Elizabeth—dreamy, elusive, independent, and canny—might be called a flaneuse, someone curious about the world. But we’ll never know what kind of life she would have led; by the time her bisected body was found in a vacant lot, six days after she left the Biltmore, Elizabeth had ceased to be a person. From then on, she became “The Black Dahlia,” an archetype, a myth, a riddle that countless people have attempted to solve in books, films, television shows, podcasts, websites, internet-message boards, and social-media posts.

“After we are dead, the pretense that we may be protected against the world’s careless malice is abandoned,” Janet Malcolm wrote in her book The Silent Woman. She was referring to the poet and novelist Sylvia Plath, another beautiful young woman who died too soon, after which her life and words became grist for the biographical mill. But Malcolm’s words apply equally, even eerily, to the afterlife of Short—one of America’s most famous murder victims, and certainly among the most persistent subjects of the true-crime industrial complex.

From the moment Short’s killing became headline news, sensation was the prime directive. With every new lead, confession, and suspect, the actual Elizabeth receded further. It didn’t help that she was an enigmatic character in life, prone to embellishment and even lies. She recounted tales of woe to paramours only to ask them for money, exaggerated her prospects in missives to her mother, told friends about a dead husband and a child who probably didn’t exist—all without letting on about her actual precarious straits. Short avoided the spotlight, but over the nearly 80 years since her death, it has wholly consumed her.

This kind of flattening happens all too often with murder victims, particularly young women and girls who die at the hands of a serial killer, usually male. (Never mind that more marginalized women, especially women of color, are less likely to merit any attention at all.) In Short’s case, the flattening is particularly egregious, because the inchoate facts of her life are shoehorned into the obsessions of amateur sleuths who continue to get those facts wrong.

Read: A provocative argument about what creates serial killers

William J. Mann’s new book, Black Dahlia: Murder, Monsters, and Madness in Midcentury Hollywood, attempts a different approach: to weave the fragments we have into a narrative whole that prioritizes Short, in all of her contradictions, and tries to debunk decades’ worth of accumulated myths. Although Mann’s effort stands apart from the overlong run of books about the case, it, too, is undercut by the need to name a likely suspect, playing into the true-crime imperative it aims to leave behind.

Mann begins Black Dahlia in late July 1946, several months before Short’s murder and not long after her arrival in Long Beach, California. Over the ensuing period, Short befriends women and dates men; wears sophisticated clothing, ankle-strapped high heels, and flowers in her hair; and comes across as “a very modest girl who never cursed or acted sexy,” in the words of one friend. The reader comes to understand why fascination has proved more appealing than facts: We know very little about her life. Short defied norms and customs. She seemed innocent in the ways of men but savvy enough to keep her dates at a respectful distance. The two women who knew her best during this time, Marjorie Graham and Anne Toth, whom Mann renders more fully than any author before him, still had trouble understanding what made Short tick.

Mann starts the story, however, from the vantage point of Tod Faulkner, who says he first spotted Short in a two-piece bathing suit, walking alone toward the beach, and saw her again several more times that summer. Faulkner was 11 at the time, and says he never forgot her. Yet after growing up to become a journalist, he was the one who immortalized the erroneous middle name “Ann,” in a 1971 article for the Los Angeles Times. Faulkner’s error would propagate in numerous articles, books, and films before being codified in the 1975 TV movie Who Is the Black Dahlia?, which starred Lucie Arnaz (the daughter of Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz) as Short. Already we have the conflict between truth and myth, and we’re only on page four.

From there, Mann situates the known facts about the last few months of Short’s life in postwar Los Angeles, whose rising murder rate led to an even sharper spike in fear. From 1945 to 1946, “while the homicide rate for men grew by 26.8 percent, the number of women murdered in that same period shot up by 52.9 percent,” Mann points out. Over the next few years, the increase in violent deaths of women, seemingly at the hands of strangers, was reflected in the growing genre of film noir and in novels including Dorothy B. Hughes’s In a Lonely Place, which was published less than a year after Short’s murder.

Fear also sold newspapers, as any tabloid journalist at the time could tell you. And tell people they did, particularly in the early days and weeks after Short’s death, when the tiniest new detail about the “Black Dahlia” investigation—even, or especially, if that detail wasn’t true—could boost circulation. Mann calls out many instances of “sexing up the news” (a phrase he uses multiple times): the description of the block where Short’s body was discovered as a “lover’s lane”; invented testimony from witnesses and family members (including Short’s grieving mother, Phoebe); exaggerations in the memoirs of the L.A. newspaper editors Agness Underwood and Jimmy Richardson, early chroniclers—and shapers—of the murder narrative.

The errors and suppositions would multiply over the decades—most of them cataloged by the former L.A. Times reporter and historian Larry Harnisch. Was Short a sex worker? Blame John Gregory Dunne’s otherwise terrific 1977 novel, True Confessions, which gave its Short stand-in the moniker “The Virgin Tramp” along with a past career in pornography. (Without True Confessions, James Ellroy probably wouldn’t have written his own The Black Dahlia novel in 1987, which led to a 2006 film adaptation.) Did she have sexual dysfunction? That’s an invention of a former Examiner reporter, Will Fowler, bolstered by John Gilmore in his supposedly nonfiction 1994 account, Severed, which includes information from a detective, “Herman Willis,” who doesn’t seem to have existed.

False suspects also proliferated. Was George Hodel the killer? So his son Steve Hodel keeps insisting, first in his 2003 book, Black Dahlia Avenger, then in a later book that also puts George forward as the Zodiac Killer (oy). Janice Knowlton, too, believed that her father murdered Elizabeth: Read about it in Daddy Was the Black Dahlia Killer. Piu Eatwell’s Black Dahlia, Red Rose initially convinced me that Leslie Dillon was the culprit, but Mann’s account definitively rules Dillon out. Eli Frankel’s Sisters in Death, published just last year, strains (and, to my mind, fails) to connect Short to an unsolved murder in Kansas City. And a new podcast hosted by Michael Connelly, Killer in the Code, also tries to connect the Black Dahlia and the Zodiac Killer, with the help of a “cold-case consultant” who bases his “smoking gun” on a deathbed sketch that better resembles fan art.

Shiftiness, con artistry, and even violence toward women don’t add up to hard, incriminating evidence. Mann, too, succumbs to the temptation, perhaps reluctantly; he spends precious pages explaining why one of Elizabeth’s Long Beach boyfriends, a military veteran named Marvin Margolis who died in 1993—the same suspect in Connelly’s podcast—can’t be ruled out as the killer. (The original detectives crossed him off the list early in the investigation.) Even Mann seems dissatisfied when he mulls the prospect that a stranger killed Short: “She was simply a vulnerable young woman who came face-to-face with someone with severe and violent psychopathology who decided, either on impulse or deliberation, to kill her, to use her body to express rage and resentment at the world.”

After so much time has passed, no one is likely to be satisfied with any identification of Short’s killer. If the lead detective, Harry Hansen, is to be believed, the Los Angeles Police Department never once interviewed the actual killer despite interrogating scores of suspects—including all of those mentioned in prior books, and now Mann’s. Any outcome would likely resemble the identification last September, via investigative genetic genealogy, of the man responsible for the 1991 quadruple homicide in Austin, Texas, known as the “Yogurt Shop Murders.” In that case, pinning down the murderer didn’t erase the 34 years of anguish and damage sustained by the girls’ families and the young men wrongfully convicted—including one who had been on death row. After decades of pain and exploitation, solving the case feels like an anticlimax.

“Solving” the Black Dahlia case, most likely through genetic genealogy, may bring an answer, but it would only generate many more questions. Harnisch, the historian, who knows more about the case than almost anybody (and has a credible theory relegated to a footnote in Mann’s book), put it best in a 2020 interview: “This is a story that fades to conjecture. This is a story without an ending.”

Look past the need for narrative and there, out on the horizon, is Elizabeth Short, walking down a California boulevard, trying to create a better story for herself. She didn’t have to remain forever a girl wounded by her father’s rejection, too proud to admit the truth about her life to her mother and sisters, yet resourceful enough to survive, for a time, in a world that couldn’t care less. Her luck ran out, and we don’t know why, or who killed her. But the brutality of Short’s death shouldn’t supersede her life any more than myth should overshadow a larger truth: that her murder will never truly make any sense.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Anyone who thinks the contemplative life amounts to a form of quietism or a retreat from the world’s suffering should spend some time shadowing Joan Halifax, the Zen priest and anthropologist. I’d been curious about Halifax for years, ever since I heard about an annual trek that she leads through the mountains of Nepal, bringing a cadre of doctors and dentists to remote mountain villages with little access to health care.

Each summer over the course of two weeks or so, this Nomads Clinic covers more than 100 miles on foot and horseback, at altitudes of nearly 18,000 feet. These “medical mountaineers,” as they’ve been called,  all volunteers, sleep in tents, often in freezing temperatures. But after some 40 annual trips to Nepal—Halifax is normally based in Sante Fe—she recently decided it was time to hang it up. She had just turned 80.

In addition to bringing medical care to remote mountain villages half a world away, Halifax has ministered to the dying in hospice, worked with the homeless in New Mexico, cared for prisoners on death row, and led countless protests for peace. I don’t know if Halifax has shed the last remnants of her ego—she would say she hasn’t—but the selflessness she manifests in the conduct of her life is something to behold, a reminder of what the exploration of human consciousness can lead a person to do and be. This, too, is a Buddhist principle—that overcoming one’s own small self should lead to greater compassion for others, and that the suffering alleviated when we transcend the ego is not only our own.

For more than 30 years, Halifax has been the abbot at Upaya Zen Center, the retreat she founded in Santa Fe in 1990. I’ve had the chance to meet her a couple of times; once, we appeared together on a panel to talk about psychedelics. Halifax was married to the pioneering Czech psychiatrist Stanislav Grof for several years in the 1970s. Working together, they gave transformative doses of LSD to the dying. For a period of time, Halifax regularly took large doses of LSD herself. Her first psychedelic trip, while wandering the streets of Paris in 1968, showed her “that there was beauty behind the beauty I perceived, and that mind was both in here and out there. I was dumbstruck.”

I could relate. After years of curiosity about psychoactive plants, my own experimentation with mushrooms and LSD in recent years fundamentally changed the way I understand the mysteries of consciousness and the self. So in 2024, I emailed Halifax to see if I might pay a visit to Upaya. My idea was to spend a week or so in residence, meditating with the aspiring monks, performing monkish chores, interviewing Halifax, and seeing if I could make a little more progress untying the knot of self. “Upaya is a factory for the deconstruction of selves,” she had told me. I was curious to find out how that worked.

Read: Psychedelics open your brain. You might not like what falls in.

But Roshi Joan, as everyone calls her, had other plans for me. She decided I should spend a day or two at Upaya and then accompany her up to “the refuge,” an off-the-grid compound of tiny houses and huts stretched out across a broad hammock of meadow at 9,400 feet in the Sangre de Cristo Mountains, north of Santa Fe. Whenever she’s not traveling or running conferences or teaching, Halifax retreats to these mountains, where she meditates and hikes and paints and writes and doesn’t have to play the role of abbot. She dispatches students to the refuge when she deems them in need of a period of monastic solitude—for years at a time, in some cases.

“After you’ve acclimated to the altitude, we’ll drive up to the refuge,” she said by email before my arrival in Santa Fe. “You can stay in the cave.” This was not put in the form of a question.

Halifax explained that even though it had neither plumbing nor electricity nor an internet connection, this was “a five-star cave” and I would be comfortable—or, more likely, I’d be uncomfortable in a spiritually productive way. I’m not much of a camper but decided I might as well put myself in her hands to see what the experience would yield.

The first thing you notice about Joan Halifax is her undiminished beauty—the shining blue eyes and the easy smile and the generous sweep of white hair. That she’s 83 is hard to believe. She moves through Upaya’s little village of low-slung adobes and tended gardens with a graceful authority. Yet abbot is a role that, these days, she’s more than happy to trade for the solitude and freedom of the refuge.

The refuge is at the end of a 25-mile-long rutted dirt road that climbs through a shadowy forest of pine and spruce, punctuated by the sparkle of the occasional stream or meadow. Though it was well into June, spring was still unfolding at this altitude, the meadow grasses and spruce tips bright green and the groves of ivory-trunked aspen just leafing out. After we unloaded our SUV at the main house, where we would gather for meals (and connect to the outside world, as the house has a satellite internet connection), Halifax escorted me to my lodgings, a hike of half a mile along a path through meadows lined with aspen trees, their new leaves fluttering gently. Along the way, she identified the scat of elk, deer, and bears.

The cave was a 12-by-15-foot cell dug into a south-facing hillside and lined with brown stucco; it was windowless except for a sliding glass door overlooking the meadow. In one corner stood a spartan single bed, in the other a small woodstove. Between them, against the back wall, a meditation cushion sat on a raised platform, beneath an embroidered fabric depicting a Buddhist figure I didn’t recognize. I pictured myself seated cross-legged on the platform, like one of those levitating yogis in a New Yorker cartoon. The room also had a small sink fed by a five-gallon jug of water suspended above it, a two-burner camp stove, some shelving for clothes and books, and a car battery hooked up to a small solar panel outside. This produced just enough juice to power a reading light and charge a phone, though with no cell service or internet connection, what was the point?

What was the point? Why did Roshi Joan want me here rather than at Upaya or the main house, with its creature comforts? (And why did she keep putting off our interview?) I came to suspect she had decided that the questions I had for her—questions regarding Buddhist ideas about the self and consciousness and her own path from psychedelics to Zen—were best approached obliquely, perhaps by way of firsthand experience rather than words; that I should answer them myself. When I’d told her what I was working on, she had diagnosed me as hopelessly stuck in my head. Better to spend several days alone with myself meditating and navigating these hills than in the more familiar landscape of concepts, something to which I should have known a Zen priest would be allergic. When we finally did sit down for our interview, in the main house on the morning of the third day, Roshi Joan began by saying, somewhat cryptically, that she had “divested from meaning.” Okay.

It took me a while to realize that for Halifax, the practice of Buddhism was everything and theories were of little use or consequence. It was only through doing that she had learned her most enduring life lessons, whether that meant sitting with death-row inmates who taught her how powerlessness ferments into anger, or ministering to people in their last days and hours. “You learn to be nimble toward whatever is arising, because there’s no one death,” she said, “and if you cling to expectations, you will experience futility.” It was here, in doing the work, that Buddhist ideas about impermanence, conditioning, and dependent arising became flesh.

I took the hint. When I asked Halifax about herself or about Buddhist philosophy, she often ducked my questions or directed me elsewhere, so during one of our daily walks, I instead asked her to describe exactly how her factory for the deconstruction of selves operated.

People come on silent retreat for a week or two at a time and spend most of their days sitting in the Zendo—the meditation hall—facing a wall or tracing walking meditations on the gravel paths that meander through Upaya’s gardens. (I’d witnessed this glacial parade of earnest zombies.) I asked if novices received any guidance or technique. Not much, she said. Students are instructed about posture, and beginners are told to follow the breath, which “unifies body, mind, and space.” As Halifax has written, zazen, or sitting, “is not a mental exercise, a thing you do with your mind.” Rather, “it is about being radically open to things just as they are, not grasping at or rejecting phenomena, but simply being present and at ease with moment-to-moment uncertainty and groundlessness” and “letting openness or not-knowing deconstruct our version of reality. It is the method of non-method.” Just sitting, upright—that, apparently, is all there is to zazen.

“Zen is the hardest school,” Halifax explained, “because there is so little support.” But at Upaya, she told me, “there is the jungle gym of structure”—the strict rules and rituals and routines that govern life on retreat.

“There’s a certain point at about day three where you can feel the whole room go poof,” she said. “And everyone realizes we’re now in one body, one mind.” I asked her how this transformation was achieved. “We don’t say we’re deconstructing the self, but that is what we’re doing,” she told me. “Living in silence means you can’t start a conversation, so there’s no opportunity for self-presentation. Then there are the rituals that organize the day. These draw people into the group and relieve them of having to make decisions. Rituals take the place of a certain amount of volition.” It hadn’t occurred to me that ritual and silence could serve as tools to change consciousness and breach the hard shell of self.

But it is the agony of meditating for hours at a time that finally breaks down the ego. I asked her what people meditate about. “Mostly they ruminate and plan,” she said. “They do that until they can’t stand the thought of themselves any longer. You’re just sitting there for hours on end, and the entertainment value of watching the same reruns all day long diminishes over time. Pretty soon, it becomes unsustainable; they’re exhausted and uncomfortable, and that’s when they drop in.”

To “drop in,” Halifax explained, is to enter a state of being completely present in time and space, experiencing “the sense field”—the world as it appears to our senses prior to thought—without conceptualizing, and surrendering the sense of a separate self. The recipe was simpler (and much less appetizing) than I would have imagined: To transcend the self, force yourself to be alone with it long enough to get so bored and exhausted that you are happy to let it go.

Halifax, who did anthropological fieldwork in Africa, thinks of the Zen retreat as an initiation ceremony, or rite of passage, and like most such rites, it involves the metaphorical death of the ego followed by rejoining the group. She regards the psychedelic trip as another rite of initiation, but “it’s a shortcut,” and one she’d rather her students not take. I wondered if this helped explain why she preferred that I stay at the refuge rather than mingle with her students at Upaya. Perhaps she thought contact with me would undermine the process by encouraging them to take the psychedelic shortcut.

“There is a lot gained when we give up the self,” she noted. “We break out of rumination. We discover we’re part of something larger, and we learn it feels good to care for others.” When I asked Halifax if she had succeeded in exorcising her own self, she allowed that she can be self-righteous at times. “There is moral injury, moral outrage, moral apathy—all of them are products of either a sense of superiority or inferiority,” she said. “So they’re all ego-based.”

I came to understand that Roshi Joan had sent me to the cave because there were no words or ideas she could offer that would teach me as much as simply being completely alone with myself in the middle of these mountains, with no phone or any other screens (and no toilet). Her idea, I eventually saw, was to pose a kind of experiential koan for me to puzzle and, perhaps, to help me unlearn some of the things I thought I had learned about consciousness and the self.

Cave life quickly stripped down to the bare essentials: collecting, splitting, and stacking wood; building fires; hauling water; digging pits in the woods; sweeping the floor and threshold; and, for hours each day, meditating on the platform. I’ve meditated for several years now, but never as easily or as deeply or as strangely as I did in my little cave. It may have been the silence, which felt bottomless, or the certainty that I would not be interrupted or distracted. Even the air there felt different, as if the absence of the electromagnetic waves that normally surround and pass through us made it easier to empty the mind of its usual detritus. I found I could sit for hours at a time, something I’d never managed to do before.

It helped that there was nothing else I needed to do, except maybe brew a cup of tea or sweep the cave again. Somehow, these seemed like particularly cave-appropriate activities. I fell into a routine so elemental and repetitive that it began to feel like ritual. The only snafu came the first time I attempted to use my hand-dug pit toilet and, failing to position myself properly, managed to pee into my sneaker. Now I was a shoeless monk. Which also seemed cave-appropriate.

One morning, I decided to try a meditation I’d learned from my time with the Nepalese French Buddhist monk Matthieu Ricard, who has written extensively on the self as an illusion. To see this, he suggested I explore the rooms of my mind, one by one, as if searching for a thief—what he called “the thief of self.” Looking within, I found all sorts of mental stuff but, as Ricard had predicted, none of it qualified as a self. Rather, I witnessed a parade of unbidden, free-floating perceptions, feelings, images, sensations, and thoughts, but I could locate no thinker of these thoughts or perceiver of these perceptions.

The longer I sat, the stranger these appearances became, as the space of my awareness became an empty stage. Picture a circus ring where all kinds of images might suddenly and inexplicably appear out of nowhere. Why is there now a bank of three old-timey telephone booths with men inside making calls? And what’s this hammer suddenly coming down on a knee?! Or that automatic glass door swinging open for no one? These stray images were then blasted away by a blazing sun that completely filled the space of awareness before transforming itself into a gigantic eyeball—a sighted sun with a black circle of iris. Could this be the anarchic mind that emerges when the ego relinquishes its hold?

Maybe, and yet these dreamy, hypnagogic images were more curious than frightening, probably because it was easy enough to chase them away, to change the mental channel, simply by willing it. So then who, or what, did the chasing? The source of that will, that inchoate “I,” might have escaped introspective detection, yet it could still make things happen or stop happening. The self might well be illusory, I decided, but no more so than color or any other construct of the mind. Put another way, the self can be both illusory and real, or real enough.

Initially, I found I was talking to myself out loud, trying to fill the vast space of silence, which made it feel as though I had doubled my self rather than eliminated it—given it a little company. “Should I brew a cup of tea? Put another log on the fire?” I would ask. And I would answer: “Sure,” or “Good idea.” But after a day or two, I fell in love with the silence, and the voices stopped. I found the handful of chores completely absorbing, as if nothing in the world mattered as much as splitting firewood, fully occupying my attention and leaving no remainder of thought, self-consciousness, or anticipation. The distance between living and meditating had narrowed to a sliver. When I described the satisfactions of my routine to Roshi Joan during one of our hikes, she smiled: “That’s the sacredness of the everyday.”

Something was happening to my sense of self, and it seemed to have everything to do with what was happening to my sense of time. I had never given much thought to the relationship between self and time, but it explains a lot. When the self is deprived of time past (memory) and future (anticipation), it melts away. Absorbed in meditation, or in my chores, or in watching a small herd of elk graze in the meadow below at sunset, I could feel my time horizon shrink. The feeling was unfamiliar, since my usual mental coordinates place me somewhere in the proximate future, a locus of anticipation and, all too often, unfocused worry. But now, for longer and longer stretches, I was simply here, being, with no thought of the past or the future.

To my surprise, these moments of simple and more or less self-less consciousness did not occur when my eyes were closed—in fact, the darkness sent me zooming off to all kinds of strange places. No, now it was when my eyes were open that the stream of thought stilled and pooled, and not only on the meditation platform; it could happen when I was moving around the cave doing chores or hiking in the woods. The miraculous everyday fact of consciousness loomed larger than “the hard problem” of how a brain produces subjective experience.

Had I “dropped in”? There were moments when all I experienced was what Roshi Joan had called the “sense field.” This happened especially upon opening my eyes in meditation, but it was never very long before I slipped back into reflection and then the inevitable jotting-down of notes, and all at once I was back in the self-world. To stay in that state of unthinking presence was like walking a tightrope only to suddenly look down, panic, and come plunging back to Earth.

Except once, when I managed to look not down but up. I had woken up in the middle of the night and stepped outside into the cold night air. There was a new moon, and the only light in the world was that of the stars, which were out in force, brighter and more numerous than I’d ever seen them, but also strangely different. Instead of dotting the same black scrim, like pinholes in a two-dimensional theater backdrop, the stars were scattered through space at dramatically varying distances, a vast swarm of them filling every last corner of an even vaster, more numinous, and emphatically three-dimensional darkness. Even stranger, the negative space between the stars had flipped to positive, forming a soft, almost palpable blackness that embraced the stars and reached all the way to Earth, enveloping it and me in the same intergalactic blanket. For the first time, I could see—no, could feel—that the stars and I shared the same infinite space.

My brain’s usual priors, predictions, and inferences about the night sky had broken down, it seemed, allowing me to see more of the galaxy and space itself than I ever had. There was hugely more of it and less of me, rendered infinitesimal in the presence of this immensity. I felt as though every previous experience I’d had of the night sky had been filtered through some idea or model or expectation and so had been something less than completely conscious. And I understood that this state—abstracted, distracted—had been my default. A line in a poem by Jorie Graham came to me:

This is what is wrong: we, only we, the humans, can retreat from ourselves and

Only we, the humans. Yes! What other animal can afford to be anything less than completely conscious?

This moment of being fully, freshly present to the universe stopped me cold and made me wonder if all my hard thinking about consciousness had missed something crucial about it. The more I focused the narrow beam of my attention on what consciousness is and what it does and how it came to be, the less of it I was actually experiencing—whatever it was. My time in the cave and, now, beneath this night sky showed me the price of my impatience with the mystery.

“Always keep a don’t-know mind,” Roshi Joan had said to me. Sometimes not knowing opens us to possibilities that knowing, or trying to know, or thinking we already know, closes off. In the years since I had embarked on this inquiry, desperate to know, I had narrowed the aperture of my awareness, sacrificing this, the glory of the night sky, for a keen intellectual focus. But as my days of solitude in these mountains had shown me, that wider circle of light, that numinous lantern of awareness, is still available to us, so long as we can break the spell of self and its distractions. Consciousness is a miracle, truly, and remains the deepest of mysteries, yes, but it is also so very simple that it can fit into a sentence: I open my eyes and a world appears.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Pity Chris Summerlin, the dean of students at the University of Florida. He’s being sued by an anti-Semite, and that’s not the worst of his predicament. So far, judges who have ruled on the case have given mixed verdicts on whether he is likely to win or lose at trial. Summerlin deserves to lose on the merits: He expelled a law-school student for speech that, while morally degenerate, is properly protected by the First Amendment. And––this is the pitiable part––it’s easy to see how he might have concluded that giving a bigot grounds to win a civil-rights lawsuit was his best option.

College deans and administrators keep confronting the same dilemma: They face intense pressure to punish speech that elicits fear or moral disgust on campus. They also have legal obligations—and face countervailing pressure—to refrain from violating the free-speech rights of students. They cannot always do both. The result is cases such as Damsky v. Summerlin—cases that might be avoided under a better approach to fighting anti-Semitism and other hateful ideas.

Preston Damsky was a law student at the University of Florida who was open about his belief that America was founded by and for the white race and that its racial character should be preserved, by force if necessary. According to court documents, he wrote in one assignment that “the founding generations” fought, killed, and died for their sovereignty, and argued, “We are not yet so outnumbered and so neutered that we cannot seize back what is rightfully ours.” To survive “as masters in the ancestral lands of their ancestors,” he wrote in another paper, “the People” must exercise “their revolutionary right to dismember or overthrow” the government, “a process which no deskbound jurist can gleefully look forward to; for it will be a controversy decided not by the careful balance of Justitia’s scales, but by the gruesome slashing of her sword.”

Neither passage was initially deemed to violate school rules, however much they upset Damsky’s peers. But they informed the way that administrators reacted when Damsky went on X on March 21 and posted the following:

My position on Jews is simple: whatever Harvard professor Noel Ignatiev meant by his call to “abolish the White race by any means necessary” is what I think must be done with Jews. Jews must be abolished by any means necessary.

Ignatiev, who died in 2019, was a factory worker who entered academia late in life as a Marxist and gained minor notoriety with his 1995 book, How the Irish Became White. A few years prior, he co-founded a journal called Race Traitor. He believed that whiteness and white privilege were social constructs that impeded working-class solidarity and that people ought to renounce their privilege and become “unwhite,” thus abolishing whiteness. “Without the privileges attached to it, the white race would not exist, and white skin would have no more social significance than big feet,” he once said.

After Damsky invoked Ignatiev in his X post, a Jewish law professor replied, “Are you saying you would murder me and my family? Is that your position?” To which Damsky retorted, “Did Ignatiev want Whites murdered? If so, were his words as objectionable as mine? If Ignatiev sought genocide, then surely a genocide of all Whites would be an even greater outrage than a genocide of all Jews, given the far greater number of Whites.”

The exchange troubled many observers inside and outside the university, though they differed on what to make of it. Should Damsky’s statement that “Jews must be abolished by any means necessary” be received as a portent of murderous violence? Was it the hateful rhetoric of a contemptible but presumably nonmurderous anti-Semite? Or, given the reference to a leftist academic who wanted to abolish whiteness, was it the snide trolling of a shitposter mocking a double standard? No one knew for sure. Even the closest readers of the post could trouble themselves wondering if Damsky’s words implied something more than a call for members of that group to voluntarily abjure their own identity.

Soon, Damsky was suspended, then expelled. In suspending Damsky, the school asserted that he’d “created a material and substantial disruption to the academic operation of the UF College of Law.” When it expelled him, it cited provisions in its student code that prohibit “disruptive conduct” and “harassment”––but both provisions state that whatever they prohibit does not include “conduct protected by the First Amendment.”

In subsequent legal proceedings, the University of Florida would defend the expulsion of the student, arguing that Damsky’s words constituted “true threats,” which are not protected by the First Amendment, and were disruptive. Though public schools can prohibit some speech that is “substantially disruptive to learning,” even if, outside of schooling, the same speech would be protected, there is disagreement about whether and how that precedent applies to higher education. “UF cannot hold its adult students to a standard created for students as young as five years old,” the ACLU stated in an amicus brief supporting Damsky as he sought a preliminary injunction to reverse his expulsion. “That is especially true when the adult is engaging in speech off-campus.”

To win at that preliminary stage, Damsky had to show a substantial likelihood that he would prevail in the case overall. He cleared that high hurdle, according to Judge Allen Winsor. “Some may assume that anyone uttering such commentary is more likely to act violently than someone who does not,” he wrote in his U.S. District Court opinion, but “the test is whether Damsky’s posts constituted a ‘serious expression’ that he meant ‘to commit an act of unlawful violence.’” Acknowledging that “many would not love the idea of attending school with someone who burns crosses, marches in Nazi parades, or engages in countless other forms of offensive expression,” Winsor noted—quoting Justice William Brennan’s landmark First Amendment ruling in Texas v. Johnson—it is still the case that “the government may not prohibit the expression of an idea simply because society finds the idea itself offensive or disagreeable.” Nor, the judge ruled, did the university meet the burden for showing the speech to be disruptive in a way that rendered it unprotected.

But the judge’s order to reinstate Damsky was paused pending appeal. And the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that in its estimation, the University of Florida was likely to prevail, because under the precedent set in Tinker v. Des Moines Independent Community School District, “the First Amendment does not protect speech that ‘materially disrupts classwork or involves substantial disorder or invasion of the rights of others.’” The trial court, and perhaps future appeals-court judges and the Supreme Court, will decide if they agree with the panel’s ruling that “UF students, faculty, and staff could reasonably interpret Damsky’s posts as threatening violence on UF’s campus,” and that the community “could reasonably interpret Damsky’s posts as promoting extralegal violence, and schools can regulate at least some speech that calls for illegal conduct.” (I hope other judges disagree: Such a precedent would suggest that college students can be expelled for political speech as common as “abolish whiteness,” “globalize the intifada,” and “no justice, no peace.”)

When a college decisively loses at any stage of free-speech litigation, civil libertarians typically point to the loss as a powerful case for honoring the First Amendment if only out of self-interest: Don’t expel a student like that dean did, or your school will get sued and lose too. But colleges are caught between conflicting incentives right now. Few in higher education have forgotten the 2023 congressional hearings in which Representative Elise Stefanik questioned the presidents of Harvard, MIT, and the University of Pennsylvania about anti-Semitism on campus. Each leader was asked, “Does calling for the genocide of Jews violate your rules, conduct codes, or harassment policies?” All attempted nuanced answers. For example, was the call for genocide targeted at an individual, thus amounting to harassing conduct, or was it mere vile speech?

Their answers, though legally sound, elicited a furious backlash. Stefanik called on the presidents to resign. The House passed a resolution calling the presidents “evasive and dismissive” and condemning “their failure to clearly state that calls for the genocide of Jews constitute harassment and violate their institutions’ codes of conduct.” Kathy Hochul, the governor of New York, wrote a letter to college presidents asserting that calls for genocide violate New York’s Human Rights Law, Title VI of the Civil Rights Act, and SUNY’s code of conduct; she threatened “enforcement action” if colleges and universities were found not in compliance. In Florida, Governor Ron DeSantis said that he wanted the college presidents to lose their jobs (the fate that befell Liz Magill, who resigned as Penn’s president because of that viral congressional hearing on anti-Semitism). Donald Trump and his administration would later target those same universities with anti-Semitism probes and regulatory actions that threatened billions of dollars in federal funding while severely constraining their autonomy.

For administrators at the University of Florida, who declined to comment while this litigation is ongoing, the message was presumably clear: If a student calls for the genocide of Jews, deciding whether to punish them based on whether the First Amendment technically protected the speech would be seen as suspect by federal and state officials––and might, if history repeated itself, result in job loss and significant funding losses.

Then along came Damsky with a social-media post that concluded, “Jews must be abolished by any means necessary.”

“Confronting the fact pattern in his case, an institution might well ask their legal advisers if they could justify punishing the speech,” Jackie Gharapour Wernz, an attorney who advises educational institutions about complying with nondiscrimination laws such as Title VI and Title IX, told me. And she could imagine a legal adviser signing off on a punishment, despite its risks. “If they act, they may get sued for violating free-speech rights,” she explained. “If they don’t act, they may face complaints or lawsuits from students or employees claiming they’re ignoring or contributing to a hostile environment. In a very real sense, the institution is choosing which lawsuit it wants.” Institutions may decide to consider a range of risks, she said, “including political pressure, federal attention, and backlash from different parts of the community, and sometimes those pressures drive decisions as much as the legal merits.” An institution might even want to lose in court, she said, “because that gives them cover later to say, We actually can’t punish this speech.”

Damsky’s lawyer, Anthony Sabatini, believes that the political climate is affecting what would normally be a simple case about unambiguously protected speech. “UF clearly tried to use heightened political concerns about antisemitism (or what gets called antisemitism) to pressure the district judge, as you’ll see in their pleadings,” he told me via email. “The Trump administration is clearly using Title VI to unlawfully attempt to stop lawful criticism of Israel by equating it with antisemitism and will lose in court on that.”

Of course, college administrators might also punish speech of the sort Damsky deployed out of a desire to oppose anti-Semitism or to protect the educational experience of Jews. Kenneth L. Marcus, the founder and leader of the Louis D. Brandeis Center for Human Rights Under Law, a legal organization focused on fighting anti-Semitism, argues that anti-discrimination law is a vital tool for protecting the rights of Jewish students and any others targeted on the basis of their race, color, or national origin. “Whenever we take seriously our civil-rights laws, there will be questions about conduct that falls in a gray area between protected speech and unprotected activity,” he told me. “Just because there are some tough cases doesn’t mean that we should throw out the rules altogether.”

It is dangerous, he argued, “to minimize threats and to assume that persons involved in threatening communications don’t mean what they’re saying seriously.” In the Damsky case, “administrators simply cannot wait for apparently violent threats to turn lethal before they take action,” he argued. “Can you imagine if the university had done nothing and then the speaker actually followed up on his apparent threat by making an actual effort to abolish Jews by any means necessary? The university would at a minimum be held liable for its failure to exercise due care, and it should be.”

While I agree with Marcus that “the world that we’re living in since October 7, 2023, is one in which Jewish Americans and others face continuing and real threats,” and that anti-Semitism must be fought in any healthy and morally decent society, there is no simple correlation between acts of violence and rhetoric of the sort Damsky spewed. His words clearly don’t meet the long-standing Supreme Court threshold for “true threats,” and insofar as a student is secretly planning violence, expulsion presumably wouldn’t stop them. I also doubt that compelling colleges to punish students like Damsky, despite the lack of a strong legal case, is an effective way to fight anti-Semitism.

While no one, least of all Jews, deserves to live in a world with anti-Semites, nonviolent ones included, we do live in such a world. In a country where Tucker Carlson and Candace Owens expose massive audiences to the most nonsensical conspiracy theories, and as vile an anti-Semite as Nick Fuentes has more than 1 million followers on X, insulating schools from anti-Semitism is impossible. Administrators cannot make it disappear. They can, however, help students improve at countering bad ideas.

The academic philosopher Dan Williams recently argued that establishment institutions “have clung to a set of habits and norms—most fundamentally, an aversion to engaging with illiberal ideas to avoid ‘platforming’ and ‘normalising’ them—adapted to a world that no longer exists.” From his perspective, which I find persuasive, the modern internet makes this sort of aversion unwise: Gatekeepers don’t exist in the digital era, and “once established institutions lost the privilege to control the public conversation, they acquired an obligation to participate within it.” I’d feel more hopeful about the ability of American institutions to adapt if universities prepared the rising generation to rebut history’s worst ideas rather than trying to suppress them.

If Damsky returns to law school, some classmates will treat him as a social pariah who deserves scorn. Some will fear for his everlasting soul as he transgresses morality by indulging hatred. To forbear bigots is no easy thing, and it is not for me to judge how others do it. But I hope some of his classmates would use the presence of an anti-Semitic white nationalist to hone the strongest and most persuasive arguments against his views. I hope some would study the example of Daryl Davis, the Black musician who has successfully talked multiple members of the Klu Klux Klan into giving up their hoods, and that others would follow the example of the New College of Florida students who converted a white-nationalist classmate into an anti-racist activist.

Anti-discrimination laws have a role to play in academia: College administrators have an obligation to ensure that no student is denied educational opportunities on the basis of their race, religion, ethnicity, or national origin, and that, insofar as their student bodies include bigots, they don’t harass or bully Jews or anyone else. But the policing of speech that is protected by the First Amendment is both unlawful and insufficient. Perhaps, in a world where hateful speech can be distributed to mass audiences more easily than ever before, it’s even counterproductive.</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Without Trumpism, Democrats and anti–Donald Trump conservatives tell themselves, America can once again be the nation it always was. This political moment, many feel certain, is an aberration, an unfortunate detour from who we are and what we stand for. Surely, they hope, if the MAGA Republicans can just be unseated in this fall’s midterm elections, then once Trump leaves office, this country can get back on track.

But the political space we inhabit has deep roots. It did not erupt out of nowhere in 2016. The racialized rage and contempt for the rule of law that so thoroughly mark the present are the products of a longer political project set in motion during the 1980s, when the Reagan Revolution—itself anchored in white resentment—recast racial violence as necessary and defensible, restoring to it a legitimacy that had not been seen since the Jim Crow era and the Gilded Age.

Clint Smith: Those who try to erase history will fail

One particularly notorious event, which took place four decades ago on a New York City subway car just three days before Christmas, both reflected and fueled this dramatic political shift. On December 22, 1984, a downtown-bound 2 train rattled out of the 14th Street station, its walls layered in graffiti, its riders reading newspapers or staring silently in the exhausted intimacy of a city still struggling to rebound from a major fiscal crisis in the 1970s—and finding this new decade even more challenging.

On the subway car that day were four Black teenagers who lived in the same housing project in the heart of the South Bronx—Darrell Cabey, James Ramseur, Barry Allen, and Troy Canty. This neighborhood had been especially ravaged in recent years: recreational opportunities ended, public libraries closed, streets left grim by an illegal economy of drugs and sex that had become one of the few remaining ways to make money. With little else to do on what was an unseasonably balmy afternoon, this group of friends decided to head into Manhattan. Their plan for the day was modest and desperate at once—to stop at a video arcade, jimmy open a few coin receptacles, and come away with at least a few stolen dollars in their pockets.

Seated in the same car, directly across from two of the teenagers, was a white loner named Bernie Goetz. A 37-year-old single, self-employed electronics nerd living in Greenwich Village, Goetz was also trying to simply live his life in a city coming apart at the seams. He still had a decent income and a roof over his head, but Goetz’s own material security did not temper the growing resentment he felt every time he stepped outside his apartment and onto city streets. Disconcerting numbers of unhoused people were in Union Square Park, and visibly ill men—gaunt, with lesions and ragged coughs—streamed each day into the emergency room at the nearby St. Vincent’s Hospital. Meanwhile, trash littered the sidewalks and piled up on stoops, and the illicit economy seemed to occupy every corner.

Goetz understood this disorder not as the product of scant civic resources or state retreat but rather as the result of liberal misrule—do-gooder bureaucrats, failed social programs, and a city that had coddled the undeserving and the criminal. He had long since concluded that ordinary men like him would just have to look out for themselves.

When he took his seat on the 2 train that Saturday, Goetz had just spent a frustrating morning working on a piece of electrical equipment and had decided to head downtown for a bit. As he now regularly did, he was carrying a loaded .38-caliber Smith & Wesson hidden in a quick-draw holster inside his waistband.

Canty took in the white guy who had boarded at Union Square, paused the fooling-around that he had been doing with his friends—slapping at the plastic straps that hung from the ceiling of the train car, joking loudly—and greeted the man. Encouraged when he got a terse “Fine” after a “How are you?” Canty asked if the man had $5. He didn’t mind panhandling. That had become a way of life for the city’s poorest residents, young and old alike.

Allen was even more encouraged when this man stood slowly, turning as if he might be getting his wallet. But then Goetz swung back around, assumed a combat stance, and began firing.

Within seconds, Goetz shot Canty in the chest and Allen, who had been standing nearby, in the back as he tried to flee. Goetz next aimed his weapon at Ramseur and then Cabey, who sat farther down the car. He hit Ramseur, who was also trying to run. The bullet pierced Ramseur’s arm and entered his chest through his side. But Goetz’s fourth bullet missed Cabey, and the shooter was, as he later made clear, determined to take every one of the kids out.

As Cabey cowered in his seat, Goetz walked over to him and said, “You seem to be all right. Here’s another,” before shooting at him again from point-blank range.

Goetz didn’t kill these teenagers, but not because he hadn’t tried. He later said, “If I had more bullets, I would have shot ’em all again and again. My problem was I ran out of bullets.”

Yet this man, who then disappeared into the tunnels of the NYC subway system and remained on the lam for nine days, was not reviled as a vicious and violent criminal by a stunning number of New Yorkers, particularly white ones. Goetz became an overnight celebrity, heralded as a real-life “Death Wish Vigilante,” a reference to the blockbuster movies of this era, in which Charles Bronson plays a regular white guy who chooses to meet urban threats with lethal force. Here was a man who had had enough, who had done what others wished they could.

Goetz’s victims were, in turn, villainized and bombarded with hate mail. No matter that these young people were all only 18 or 19, and also unarmed and slight, the tallest of them only 5 feet 6 inches. No matter that Goetz had severed Cabey’s spinal cord and permanently paralyzed him from the waist down. No matter that Ramseur was found dead, likely from suicide, on an anniversary of this horrific event, and that Allen would descend into drug addiction.

They were deemed thugs and animals, and were said to symbolize all that was wrong with America’s cities as well as with the liberals who had enabled the city’s poor, lazy, and criminal elements. They were proof that hard-working Americans were under siege. These teens had gotten exactly what they deserved.

But the public’s reaction to the subway shooting was neither obvious nor inevitable; it was actively cultivated. Doing much of the work to normalize hatred and violence after the event were conservative, misinformation-driven media that were themselves aggressive and ascendant. The Goetz case was a long-awaited opportunity, particularly for the conservative Australian media mogul Rupert Murdoch, who dreamed of making his paper the New York Post the dominant tabloid in NYC and then taking over the entire U.S. news-media market.

From the moment that Goetz pulled the trigger on Cabey, Ramseur, Allen, and Canty, columnists from both the New York Post and the other major New York tabloid trying to hold its own, the Daily News, framed the case as a referendum on self-defense rather than an act of attempted murder. Even though the teens were the ones in ICUs and Goetz had been carrying an illegal weapon on the train that day, they were the “predator” and he was the “prey.”

During the 1980s, both tabloids pandered to the racial resentments and fears of white New Yorkers when covering all of the city’s ills. The New York Post seemed to practically invite readers to cheer for acts of white rage—in the Goetz case and the brutal white-mob killings of Black New Yorkers in Howard Beach and later in Bensonhurst—as well as to steadfastly ignore the civic wreckage that had paved the way for such acts of lawlessness in the first place.

Facts had begun to matter less and less. For example, even though it was fiction, a story that the teenagers Goetz shot were wielding sharpened screwdrivers soon became gospel in tabloid and mainstream press alike. This very much mattered to how the public felt about the case.

But what mattered more was a political shift that was taking place, one that had made it possible for the right-leaning media to profit so handsomely off the resentment and rage of ordinary people.

In 1980, Ronald Reagan took the White House. He insisted that government was bloated and inefficient, that liberal social programs bred only dependency and crime, and that law-abiding citizens, implicitly white, had been abandoned in favor of a lazy “underclass,” often marked explicitly as Black. The Reagan administration counted on Murdoch’s newspapers to hammer away at these messages on its behalf.

According to Reagan Republicans, America’s problems could be solved by cutting federal spending, slashing taxes, and gutting regulations on business. If the rich thrived, their argument went, the benefits would trickle downward to the nation as a whole.

The desire to do all of these things was not new—it had long animated the ambitions of the country’s wealthiest Americans. Ever since the New Deal had constructed a meaningful social safety net in response to the devastation of the Great Depression, the rich had sought to weaken labor, shrink the public sector, delegitimize redistributive social policies, deregulate finance and industry, and drive taxes lower. They had long insisted that private control of public life simply made sense.

Yet it was politically risky for any administration to openly slash the tax base that funded public schools, affordable housing, city services, and public-health systems. As jobs disappear, wages fall, housing and health care grow scarce, and education becomes an engine of debt, people might not only be left poorer; they also might demand accountability and redress.

Reagan Republicans fully understood the political risks of dismantling more than 50 years of public policy, yet—more effectively than any of their predecessors—they succeeded in manufacturing the popular consent needed to do precisely that. The key to this achievement was a simple but devastating insight: The most effective way to discredit liberal social policy was to starve it of resources and then point to its inevitable failure. As the Reagan aide James Cicconi explained in an internal memo, the era of “decreasing governmental resources” would make  the “liberal approach” to governance “impossible to sustain financially.” This would force the adoption of “alternatives.”

With each passing year of the 1980s, this engineered collapse was recast as proof that the nation’s problems flowed from liberal social, political, and racial policies, and from the supposed moral failures of people who, it was claimed, simply did not want to work. Inequality was framed as meritocracy.

As the Reagan Revolution matured, taxes were slashed and regulations rolled back; in turn, the social programs and city services upon which ordinary Americans depended were devastated. And as the rich grew richer and the lives of ordinary people grew more difficult, the narratives emanating from the White House down continued to blame the deepening crisis—the rise in homelessness, the AIDS epidemic, the garbage-strewn streets, the turn to illegal economies—not on policy choices but on bad people. Crime, disease, and addiction were cast as moral failures rather than as the predictable consequences of political decisions.

Arguments such as these distracted the public from rethinking the true cost of stripping public coffers and actively widening the country’s income gap. In this sense, politicians interested in remaking the economy in ways more favorable to the rich did not merely rely on racialized resentment; they also helped ensure that anger would be directed downward, toward those even less fortunate than themselves.

White Americans in particular were offered a Faustian bargain during the Reagan ’80s: accept a thinner safety net, a harsher economy, and a more unequal society—but in return, receive the emotional satisfaction of seeing the “right” people punished by an ever-expanding criminal-justice system, and the tacit assurance that if they happened to visit their own frustrations on someone who did not look like them, that same system would protect them.

Ultimately, the fueling of racial fear did extraordinary political and cultural work, fixing public attention on crime rather than wage theft, on disorder rather than deregulation, on punishment rather than the public good. The Goetz saga proved just how effectively narratives of crime, and outright misinformation, could be used to discredit government, justify inequality, and legitimize extrajudicial violence—all while claiming the mantle of common sense.

When he was finally apprehended, Goetz claimed that he had no regrets for what he did. He made no apologies for wanting “to kill those guys; I wanted to maim those guys; I wanted to make them suffer in every way I could”—not because his victims were armed (they were not), but because he felt besieged and abandoned, and thus justified in striking back. He railed at the assistant district attorney who took his statement: The subway system was “a disaster,” crime in the city was “a disaster,” and the government in charge of all of it was “a disgrace.”

Goetz’s journey through the justice system reinforced the idea that his worldview had merit. A grand jury was convened despite extraordinary public pressure to simply let him skate, and then it declined to indict Goetz on attempted-murder charges. However, word got out that Goetz had confessed to gunning down the teens, had told detectives that “robbery had nothing to do [with] it,” and, what is more, had admitted to shooting Cabey a second time. A second grand jury was convened that indicted Goetz for a range of serious charges, including attempted murder. In the trial that followed, however, a jury of Goetz’s peers decided that, despite the evidence mounted against him, he was guilty of only the most minor gun charges he faced.

Goetz served eight months in jail. The message sent to the American public was unmistakable: It is perfectly okay for at least some people to take the law into their own hands.

Goetz’s case helped build the early architecture of conservative tabloid media and inflammatory talk radio. This seeded the ecosystem of social media and Fox News coverage that, together, perfected the art of viral outrage and the mobilization of economic anxiety for political ends. And although mainstream news outlets did not openly revel in—or explicitly justify—the Goetz shootings, they did privilege coverage of urban crime and disorder over careful, sustained attention to the structural conditions and policy choices that made cities less safe and eroded the material security of ordinary people.

Equally significant was the fact that the economic and cultural transformation that this country had undergone since the 1980s was never a project confined to conservative politicians. Politicians across party lines contributed to the steady dismantling of America’s social safety net and the stoking of resentment and rage, even as they worked to channel these for their own partisan ends. Bill Clinton would deliver the most devastating blow to welfare; Trump would perfect the art of turning fear into fury.

We are still living today through the long Reagan Revolution: A teenager crosses state lines with an assault rifle and is hailed as a patriot for killing protesters; a mob storms the Capitol, convinced that violence is necessary to “save” democracy, and is pardoned; an ICE agent shoots and kills a mother and is said to have acted in self-defense, despite all evidence to the contrary; politicians denounce crime while simultaneously cutting the very social programs that ordinary people need to survive and that help sustain safe communities.

Gal Beckerman: Minnesota had its Birmingham moment

Trump did not invent these dynamics; he inherited them. He did not create the legitimacy of white grievance. And he did not usher in a new age of white racial violence or escalating income inequality; he has merely decided to unabashedly incite the former and defend the latter.

As the country moves toward the 2026 midterms, the temptation will be to treat our current racial, political, and economic crisis as a sharp break from the past; to search for singular villains; and to imagine that a return to normalcy is just one election away. But political cultures do not change course simply because their most flamboyant representatives enter or exit the stage.

The hard and necessary task now is to reckon with how past moments such as the Bernie Goetz shootings of 1984 helped remake the boundaries of how much racial violence, inequality, hatred, and indifference we as a society are willing to quietly endorse or even embrace. Only by confronting our history honestly can we begin to understand why appeals to fear remain potent, why calls for punishment eclipse demands for justice, and why the promise of democracy has been so unevenly realized.</div>

There was also a time when Main Street business buildings featured business on the ground floor and residence on the next floor up, where the small business was a sole-proprietorship and the owner lived above the store.  In other configurations it was a front/back divide, with the shop on the front facing the boulevard and the home on the back facing the side-street or the alley.

The modern shopping-center doesn&#39;t generally seem to cater to that, and cities don&#39;t seem to zone for that kind of arrangement much anymore.

It&#39;s time to recognize that rent is theft.Someone took the risk, bought the land, built the infrastructure, the building, parking lot, etc. all with the hope that they would recoup that investment through renting the space to retailers. Sometimes this works, sometimes it doesn&#39;t. There are plenty of malls right now who are struggling to fill their huge sq. ft. space with anything at all, and those owners are losing piles of money. This also keeps the cost of starting a business much lower because you can simply rent prepared space and don&#39;t have to invest in building all of that yourself. And yes, that convenience takes a share of your profits (but owning and maintaining your own land, parking lot, infrastructure, etc. would also take a share of your profits). AND, property doesn&#39;t always go up in value. So there&#39;s the risk that even if you invest, own, and maintain your owned property, that the new highway or entertainment district or etc. will be built somewhere else and your property will suddenly be worth much less. With renting, you can pay less rent or just move on to a new location. If your customers value what you offer, they&#39;ll find you in your new location, too.  HOAs are the bane of most homeowners&#39; existence. Many businesses already participate in these sorts of groups (such as Downtown Business association, etc.), and adding more will only increase the complexity and costs.

Someone with a bunch of advantages probably related to past crimes leveraged those advantages into rent seeking, which is inherently harmful to capitalism as it represents profiting from inactivity and a prior advantage and only leads to more of the same sucking of wealth out of the pockets of those actually working, and you dashed into the fray to defend them.

&quot;Probably&quot; related to past crimes? Way to generalize.

Sure, there are landlords involved in crime. But most are just...landlords. If you want to blame this all on crime, you&#39;ll need some evidence, not just accusations.

My brother owns a small business and leased a space in one of those little shopping centers. The reality is, many shopping center owners go to great lengths to accommodate and work with tenants who are struggling. They will enter into unusual and creative arrangements if they need to, because it&#39;s harder to find a good new tenant than to keep the ones you already have.

You&#39;re assuming a mall will always have tenants, that&#39;s a dumb assumption. Places with high churn usually have low interest as well. There&#39;s countless examples of malls that are EMPTY. There&#39;s no one interested moving in, and sure as heck no one to pay money. There&#39;s a whole subreddit dedicated to photos of dead malls https://www.reddit.com/r/deadm... [reddit.com]

Business associations can do things like pool their funds together to build a parking garage so individual businesses don&#39;t have to provide their own onsite parking. Where land is expensive, this can be a really good deal for them.

Businesses used to capture that value because they often owned the property that hosted them. Now they rarely do.

&quot;Whether I&#39;m paying a mortgage or rent, what difference does it make in my viability when property values double?&quot;

The difference is that a mortgage does&#39;t go up, because it is the amount of money you borrowed to buy the property, and that transaction in the past doesn&#39;t change because prices are changing now, while the rent will likely double itself.

Now, granted, your property taxes are gonna go up, but that&#39;s a cost you were going to be paying indirectly as a renter anyways.

You were right, until the last sentence, which is a non-sequitur in relation to the first sentences.

Yes, the building owners do &quot;capture&quot; the rising values. That is the nature of the risk they took. They risked their money to build the buildings and maintain them, a business venture in itself, which can succeed or fail. If a small business wants to &quot;capture&quot; rising property values, they need to purchase or build the building they operate in. There are plenty of businesses that do just that.

... like Seattle and its neighborhoods do. Find all of the interesting shops an quirky boutiques that people like. And then bulldoze them to make room for the commie block apartments to house the new residents. Who wanted to move into those interesting and quirky neighborhoods.

LVT basically sounds like a connection tax.

The problem with that is it would create runaway inflation.To a certain extent, inflation only matters if you aren&#39;t the one that owns everything.  Continually devaluing wages before minimum wage can rise to meet it is another way to skim off the top.

Coffeeshops and quirky stores do not capture the value in a mixed-use building because they are tenants. It&#39;s insanely rare for a business in a city to own the actual space in the building in which they reside.

This isn&#39;t just a general poor people&#39;s case, or some modern startup business failing, but rather includes some truly historic situations too.

Café Griensteidl in Vienna which indirectly traces its roots back to 1847 and was ultimately closed because rents rose more than they could afford to pay.Tea shop &#39;t Zonnetje in Amsterdam closed after 450 years operating in the same location due to rising rents.

These are businesses that have seen empires rise and fall and yet suddenly can&#39;t afford rent because of land value increases.

Businesses usually simply don&#39;t own the buildings they operate from. They capture no value, not by themselves, not in mixed use dwellings (both the examples I gave are mixed use).

I&#39;m in the greater Philadelphia area and it is not uncommon for ground floor retail and restaurant space to be ultra low rent if the building owner thinks it makes the area hipper.

The owner extracts the value in $150/unit extra for the ten floors above.

You are right, and the  building owners are real risk-takers just as the tenants are. They stand to gain a lot or lose a lot, depending on how well their building and neighborhood does. And these business owners *do* gain from the rising values in the neighborhood.

There&#39;s some prior art in buying land around new stations before building begins. &quot;Metroland&quot; [wikipedia.org] is an area to the north west of London that was developed by the Metropolitan Railway on that basis. Build the stations, attract commuters, and make a profit from house sales and increased traffic. It would be interesting if the big gaps in CA high speed rail - San Jose to Central Valley, and Central Valley to LA, could be partly financed by commuter rail. People can commute a long way on high speed rail: look at Kent to London St Pancras on High Speed 1.

only Capitalism could muster. Always looking for a way to make a claim and profit from something they have no right to.

IMHO the answer is business condos.   I&#39;ve seen a few signs of these around town.   You buy the storefront that is part of a larger building.  Now you can benefit from the increased land value.   Don&#39;t have the capital up front, get a mortgage.   Can&#39;t get a mortgage, that should tell you something about your business.

Worth  mentioning is that there are a lot other changes happening at the same time that are affecting neighborhood shopping

Authoritarians rely on ambivalence just as much as they rely on out and out supporters.  This farcical stance of being above it all helps them more than you realize.

It will be funny to see when they figure out their servants have families that need to survive too and that throwing money does not buy loyalty. Especially when that money stop being worth anything.

They will return to serfdom.  Workers will live on the property.

Perhaps he thinks if the human race is going out we should go out in style - completely fuck the planet for millions of years by burning everything that can be sucked out of the ground.

The billionaires have their Island bunkers

Concrete makes a good blockage for doors and air vents.

Back in the real world, anyone who knows about the &quot;CO2 Global Warming&quot; theory knows that it predicts most of the warming to happen in cold areas at night, so this is obvious nonsense.Only for people with really simple minds. Things are a bit more complicated than that. You skipped over about 95% of the book and now think you understand the subject.

Some people can fake it well. I guess you fall into that group and now you have a swollen head.

The media hyped a few proposals for &quot;global cooling&quot; at one point but it was never anything like a scientific consensus. The majority of scientific studies have always argued for net warming from carbon emissions going back to at least the 1970s.

Science can only work to explain what is and attempt to predict may happen. It does not propose policies to deal with what might happen. &quot;Give the government more power&quot; is hardly the only potential reaction to global warming, but it is a political reaction not a scientific one.

Were you involved in scientific study at the time, or did you just read some newspaper articles? Nobody is denying that there were some reports of potential global cooling. But studies in the 1970s actually predicted the change in climate to-date remarkably well.

Documented here: https://journals.ametsoc.org/v... [ametsoc.org]

The odd thing is that when I was a kid and we were going to enter The New Ice Age, the solution was to... reduce hydrocarbon fuel usage, build more windmills, raise taxes and give the government more power.None of this is true. Actual scientists did not predict we were going to enter an ice age [ametsoc.org], although there was some media hype [scientificamerican.com] about that (media loves catastrophe stories). And absolutely  nobody  ever suggested that the response to an incipient ice age would be to reduce hydrocarbon fuel usage and build more windmills. Nor, for that matter, to raise taxes or give the government more power.

Better solution: Put 10000% tariffs on anything! That way, it will be all scorched earth and nobody left to care when it becomes bad.

More taxes yes, that is inevitable for America.  There is another way without more restrictions, that&#39;s a whole idea behind abundance liberalism  [theguardian.com].

That&#39;s been my argument for decades, even if the outcome doesn&#39;t change is that a huge sustained investment in the things climate change is asking for us will net us nothing but... a more robust and cheaper electrical grid, cleaner air, better and more reliable transportation choices, better buildings and homes and a ton of domestic economic growth as well as an op

I&#39;ve not read the book, but it seems even though written for the liberal leaning Americans, that it has some decent ideas about things..more common sense getting things done and not throwing in a lot of un-needed complications involving social agenda items...just get

You really do not. But I guess you are not smart enough to understand that.

There are tons of cretins that are still denying it is even happening. Obviously the human race is not ready.

What this will eventually be is a global shake-out and those that can adapt will survive reasonably intact. The others will be wiped out or reduced to insignificance. Guess who will be on which side.

AI is the new hotness and AI data centres can&#39;t be powered by solar panels and windmills. So &quot;Climate Change&quot; is done.

Or ... we can use these money to try to suppress the oil production...

Labor is cheap in the third world, the materials to make rooms to escape the heat without grid dependence aren&#39;t especially expensive. Insulation (EPS) is cheap and if mass produced you could make an air conditioning kit running off PV with an ice battery and heat recovery ventilator for 500 bucks with some profit margin included.

Air-conditioning in terribly insulated homes relying on the grid is a recipe for disaster in the developing world.

Feel like over the past 3 years we&#39;ve had multiple stories about this project scaling back, 3 or 4 more times and this will just be a regular office building.

In other news my personal Dyson sphere has been scaled back yet again!  How could anyone have seen that such a thing is an unfeasible fantasy.

Is it usb-pd or did you go down to 5v yet?

In other news my personal Dyson sphere has been scaled back yet again! Oh, no! It&#39;s a Dyson [wikipedia.org] Sphero [wikipedia.org] now, isn&#39;t it?

This is somehow news? This has been &quot;scaled back&quot; half an hour after the original presentation, what are you talking about?It did what it was meant to do - plaster saudi allover internet - did it well, now it&#39;s time to finish all the beach resorts and get some cash flowing in.

It seems like the Neom project has been scaled back a few times at this point.

I&#39;m wondering what&#39;s left at this point? A modest sized building and a port?

Yep. Big egos think big but never deliver in the long term. They can create spectacular straw-fires though.

Any resemblance to a certain ballroom or to efforts to annex some countries are obviously pure coincidence. Incidentally, have they acquitted Maduro yet?

Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman&#39;s flagship development that sprawls across a Belgium-sized stretch of Red Sea coastline and was once billed as the world&#39;s largest construction site.That is about 4.3 million football fields.

Reality strikes again! It always does in the end.

The Line was the worst idea ever. 200 meters is way too thin, it needed to be at least 400 meters wide. 200 meters is the distance you walk in about 2 minutes. A mediocre golfer can whack the ball farther than that. Speaking of sports you can&#39;t fit a stadium in there.

It stuck me as someone watched Snowpiercer and saw the class-divide among the length of the train and thought, &quot;that&#39;s a good idea, we should build a city like that!&quot;

And in some ways for social control it makes sense, basically if no one is allowed outside without express permission and oversight and subject to summary execution if caught out there, then any attempt at revolution from the unwashed masses at the bottom of society would be very difficult to bring to bear.  The city itself makes it difficult t

What I do wonder is how many Saudis have the skills needed to provide the services needed by this project?None. The vast majority of work done in Saudi is done by immigrant slave labour. I say slave labour because they take their passports from them when they enter the country so they can&#39;t leave. They&#39;re also forced to live in poor conditions and work horrific hours. The rate of work injuries and deaths is shocking.

The Line was always a deeply silly idea. Cities work due to density and having easy access to many things, while getting a lot of use of the same infrastructure. A city&#39;s efficiency and degree of flexible access scales at a better than linear rate with population because of the geometry. If I&#39;m in a given location then if I can access any location within radius R of me, that means the number of locations available goes up as roughly R^2. If one has a giant line, it only goes up like R. The entire idea of The Line read like the sort of thing that a 10 year old had and thought was really cool, and then somehow got to do it. Which given how absolutely spoiled the Saudi princes are, it wouldn&#39;t surprise me if it was the case that Mohammed bin Salman had this idea when he was a kid, and no one since then has pushed back on it because they are afraid of being Khashoggied.Except &quot;R&quot; really depends on your ability to travel. Which means what really matters is your proximity to transit and major roads.I think the Line is probably a bad idea, but I don&#39;t think that&#39;s the reason why. I think the bigger issue is that cities are ultimately organic creations, shops, industry, and residences show up where they&#39;re needed. I&#39;m not sure a planned city will be economically successful.

We have not had any attempts at competently &quot;planned cities&quot; so far. It was always somebody trying to set themselves a monument to be remembered by. That cannot go well.

Yep. Cities work because of positive distance effects and positive infrastructure effects from small distances. Up to a certain size, but still. This requires something very roughly circle-shapes. A &quot;line&quot; is the very antithesis of all the advantages a city has and can only work using an extreme amount of money and goods pumped in from the outside. And even then it works very badly.

All quite obvious. But when the &quot;architects&quot; of such a &quot;vision&quot; have tons of money and power but no sense, projects like this g

The Line, a futuristic 170-kilometer linear city that served as Neom&#39;s centerpiece, will be radically reimagined as a result, the report added.

Naaa, probably not. These people are primitive in their minds and (still) drunk on power and money. My guess is things just failed to materialize (some of the architecture was not even possible) and the money pumped in did not make a difference. Well, as soon as the world can do without their oil, they are done. They had a pretty nice chance to make something of themselves. Instead they opted for Theocracy and appearances over substance. A complete and impressive fail.

even the richest, most self-absorbed people in the world cannot just do what they want, see?  that means they&#39;re poor and it&#39;s your fault so you will pay

The whole project was a mega-joke that had ZERO chance of completion (or anything even close to it). You might as well try to chrome-plate the equator. It was beyond ambitious and kind of a stupid idea to begin with.

Cities tend to have centers, and this &quot;city&quot; was just a long, stretched-out line of pseudo-suburbs baking in the desert. No water, no nearby attractions, and did I mention that it&#39;s isolated in the middle of a wasteland? This was never going to succeed and was never intended to- it was just anot

You might as well try to chrome-plate the equator.

Unlike the &quot;I told you so&quot; who have been dismissive of this grand project, I&#39;m genuinely sad that even with the considerable resources that KSA has, they are not going ahead with the NEOM vision.

This youtuber   [youtu.be]made some interesting and very watchable TV about how the failure of the projects still helped push ahead with some progressive thinking.

Early Saturday morning, it appeared as if enough Senate Democrats were willing to fund the Department of Homeland Security and its deportation machine, if that’s what it took to keep the rest of the government open.

The House had passed funding for the DHS late last week, with seven centrist Democrats joining nearly all Republicans to get it over the line. The Senate was to take it up this week alongside a handful of other funding bills. It was expected that, as with the House vote, enough Democrats would hold their noses and support it, even if it meant absorbing blowback from a furious Democratic base that has been dusting off the largely dormant “Abolish ICE” slogan. Democratic negotiators felt that approving full-year, carefully negotiated spending bills and reasserting Congress’ power of the purse over a freewheeling executive branch was the priority of the moment.

“There is much more we must do to rein in DHS, which I will continue to press for,” Sen. Patty Murray, the top Democrat on the Senate Appropriations Committee, said in a statement last Tuesday, once the deal was released. She listed some pittances she had secured in the DHS bill, such as more money for body cameras for Immigrations and Customs Enforcement. She knew, though, that wouldn’t ease any anger within the base. Ultimately, she leveled.

“But the hard truth,” she added, “is that Democrats must win political power to enact the kind of accountability we need.”

All of this changed on Saturday in Minneapolis, when Border Patrol agents killed 37-year-old observer Alex Pretti. All of this changed when videos showed Pretti subdued, being pepper-sprayed and then shot, over and over again, without brandishing the firearm that he was permitted to carry. All of this changed when, as after the killing of Renee Good, White House adviser Stephen Miller and DHS Secretary Kristi Noem absurdly described Pretti as a “domestic terrorist” or “assassin.” After Pretti’s killing and the administration’s eyesight-defying remorselessness over what happened, there was no way Senate Democrats could put their fingerprints on a bill to fund the administration’s deportation machine.

“I will NOT support the DHS bill as it stands,” Patty Murray said Saturday.

She was hardly the only one. Democrats who’ve previously broken from the pack to join Republicans in advancing government funding bills, like Sens. Tim Kaine, Catherine Cortez Masto, Angus King, and Jacky Rosen, all said the same. On the House side, meanwhile, one Democrat who had voted for the DHS funding bill, New York Rep. Tom Suozzi, offered a mea culpa on social media, saying that he had “long been critical of ICE’s unlawful behavior and I must do a better job demonstrating that.”

Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer put a bow on Democrats’ new posture Saturday night: Democrats would filibuster DHS funding without changes. And it didn’t sound like there was much handwringing about it.

Does this make a partial government shutdown, after funding lapses after Jan. 30, inevitable? Let’s say much more likely. The situation is complicated for reasons including, but not limited to, the weather.

The funding bill the Senate will be voting on does not just cover DHS. It combines half a dozen bills that the House has passed in January funding everything from the Pentagon to the State Department to the departments of Health and Human Services, Transportation, Education, Labor, and more. Although this package includes only half of the 12 yearly appropriations bills, the specific departments it includes—especially Defense and HHS—comprise a comfortable majority of annual spending.

Senate Democrats are calling on their Republican counterparts, in Schumer’s words, to “work with Democrats to advance the other five funding bills while we work to rewrite the DHS bill.” In other words, to strip DHS funding from the package, pass everything else, and then allow for more time to negotiate the DHS budget.

Would Republicans be willing to do this? They typically don’t take orders from Democrats. But Republican leaders, just as much as Democratic ones, don’t want appropriators’ delicate work on the biggest funding bills to get sent to an incinerator of fury. The New York Times reported Saturday that “recognizing the depth of Democratic rage,” Senate Republicans “immediately began examining whether they could separate the homeland security funding from the rest of the package and preserve the bulk of what had been a bipartisan deal to fund a large chunk of the government.” Maine Sen. Susan Collins, the chair of the Appropriations Committee, said her committee was “exploring all options.”

If—if—leaders in the Senate reach an agreement to amend the package, then there’s another problem: The House is on recess this week, and House Republicans’ leaders wouldn’t be particularly enthused about summoning members to Washington to revote on a package amended at Democrats’ request. Plus, a substantial portion of the continental United States is buried under a sheet of ice and snow, conditions that aren’t conducive to travel.

It’s important to note that a lapse in DHS funding wouldn’t impede deportation operations much. As Patty Murray repeatedly said when she was trying to push the deal through, ICE is sitting on substantial funds that were made available to it in Republicans’ party-line megabill last year.

Murray is still saying that, posting on Sunday that “Americans must be eyes wide open that blocking the DHS funding bill will not shut down ICE. ICE is now sitting on a massive slush fund it can tap, whether or not we pass a funding bill.”

“But,” she added, “we all saw another American shot and killed in broad daylight.” They’re not about to bless it with their votes.

On Saturday, Alex Pretti was pushed to the ground and fatally shot by federal agents. Video shows that, moments before, Pretti was holding a cellphone in one hand and had his other hand up. Pretti was 37 and worked as an ICU nurse at a VA hospital. He enjoyed biking and had a dog named Joule.

Later that day, What Next’s Mary Harris spoke to Dimitri Drekonja, a colleague and friend of Pretti’s, who remembers him as “a kind guy” who modeled cooperation and who, right out of school, took one of the hardest jobs available to nurses. Their conversation has been edited and condensed for clarity.

Mary Harris: How did you learn about what happened?

Dimitri Drekonja: We were at [my son’s ski] race in the morning, and one of the other parents said, “Did you hear there was another shooting?” It sort of filtered through: “It sounds like another shooting.” “Another person died.” And there was a lot of sort of like, “This is just heavy.” “Awful.”

And then we got back from the race, and on a group chat, someone said, “ICE executed Alex Pretti.” [Editor’s note: It later became clear that the officers were with Customs and Border Protection.] It was from our group that we had had when we had first hired him to be study staff on our research project. It was like, What? You have to be kidding me.

I had seen one of the videos. [In it,] you can’t see the defined definitions of someone’s face and recognize them. But once the name was out there and I saw the build, the facial hair, it’s like, Oh, shit, that was Alex.

People have asked, “Are you surprised that he was protesting?” And, in all honesty, no one can be surprised that anyone in Minneapolis is protesting. We see 80-year-olds out protesting. We see kids out protesting. The city is pretty, pretty pissed off about what is happening, and people are out there doing their civic duty of being out there peacefully protesting.

Have you been able to watch the videos? I can’t stop myself watching the videos.

I don’t know how you watch someone you know—

I have not sought them out. I mean, my wife has shown me some, like, “Oh, God, with this new view you can see …” I’ve seen a few that way. It’s awful.

You posted on social media that you were feeling white-hot rage. What do you do with that feeling in this moment?

Right now, delay going to dinner with friends because I don’t feel terribly sociable. I’ve been really appreciative of people who have been reaching out to say, “Hey, sorry to hear—sounds like Alex was a great guy. This is hard.”

I think other people are enraged. I think the worst thing right now would be to have random violence. I’ve been really proud of Minneapolis—the scope and scale of the protests, the fact that they have been peaceful.

The administration has said your friend must have been trying to kill officers. Is there something you want to tell people who may have that belief about Alex?

The thing that I would say is that I have known Alex for years. I’ve known him to be a kind guy, a guy quick with a laugh, a joke, willing to help. He has never shared a conspiracy theory or shared anger at a group or been unpatriotic. I mean, he is the kind of guy that you would want as your neighbor and your friend. I would be thrilled if he were to move into the house next door.

We have a shared interest in mountain biking. We were planning on going out together. I was always the one who was having to say, “No, sorry, my kid has a race this week. Can’t do it.” But we liked the same trail systems, and we talked about riding them.

I have observed him clinically. He is fabulous, he gives great assessments, he’s enthusiastic, he is smart, and I will just say that anybody going into the ICU fresh out of nursing school—you’re gonna deal with very sick patients. A [large] percent of the patients in the ICU will die, and you’ll have to deal with grieving, upset families. You’ll have to use all your skills to try to keep that person alive. To do that right out of nursing school is impressive.

Sometimes medicine is a hierarchical place. He was not like that, and I loved that. I would run into him, and he would say, “Hey, Dimitri, how’s it going? It’s good to see you again.” I love that he had that informal relationship. I love it was modeled for trainees who worked with us. Like, yeah, this is how you do it: You’re colleagues, you’re friendly, you are nice to each other, and you work well together.

Early Saturday morning in downtown Minneapolis, 37-year-old Alex Pretti was killed by federal agents in full public view. Within hours, Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Customs and Border Protection officials released a familiar statement: An agent, they said, had acted in lawful self-defense against an armed and violent agitator. According to this narrative, Pretti instigated the violence that led to his death. A multitude of videos filmed by witnesses from multiple angles show this to be a lie.

They show Alex Pretti holding up his phone, filming as masked ICE and CBP agents shove demonstrators and pepper-spray the crowd. They show an agent shoving a woman in the street. They show Pretti stepping forward, without striking anyone or reaching for a weapon, attempting to shield the woman from the agent’s blows. They show an agent spraying Pretti directly in the face with chemical irritant. They show Pretti being tackled to the ground. They show six or seven agents piling on top of him, striking him while he lies immobilized. And they show one agent removing Pretti’s licensed handgun—which he was carrying in compliance with state law—from his waistband.

Then, while he remains pinned to the pavement, helpless beneath a mass of armed bodies, gunshots ring out. Agents scatter, and one of them appears to clap. Pretti does not get up. This is not self-defense. It is much more akin to an execution.

Pretti was a licensed, law-abiding gun owner and registered nurse who worked at a veterans hospital.

The sequence of events matters, not only because it starkly contradicts the official account but because it exposes how the language of self-defense has been distorted to the point that it now functions as a near-automatic exoneration for state violence. When authorities invoke “self-defense” today, they rarely describe a factual necessity. They are deploying a rhetorical shield with deep historical roots and devastating contemporary consequences.

Just weeks earlier, on Jan. 7, Renee Good was shot three times and killed by an ICE agent as she attempted to flee in her car. In that case, too, officials framed the killing as justified and necessary, as self-defense rather than aggression. In that case, too, video evidence and eyewitness accounts—including an agent muttering “Fucking bitch” after the shooting—raised serious questions about the agents’ alleged “fear for their lives.” There is little to suggest that lethal force was unavoidable in this case, and yet Donald Trump’s Department of Justice is refusing to investigate the killing as a homicide. Instead, it is investigating Good’s widow. The pattern should be clear: Use an empty claim of self-defense to vindicate the shooter, then frame the victim as the perpetrator.

What we are witnessing is not a series of isolated tragedies. We have reached the logical end point of a political and legal culture that has long distorted claims of vulnerability, of “reasonable fear,” in the service of power, conflating aggressive, state-sanctioned violence with necessary self-protection.

From the nation’s founding, claims of self-defense have been used to justify extraordinary brutality. Systematic colonial violence against Indigenous nations was routinely rationalized as necessary to the protection of settler families and communities. Entire Indigenous communities were eradicated under the guise of lawful defense, with Indigenous resistance labeled “Savage Wars,” as a confrontation among equals rather than a genocidal onslaught.

After the Civil War, the Ku Klux Klan organized itself “to maintain forever the supremacy of the white race.” At the center of its mission lay the claim that white society required urgent protection from formerly enslaved people. Their founding documents emphasized “the sacred duty of protecting [white] womanhood” from sexual violence, with violence as necessary.

This mandate of protection congealed into widespread racial terror, claiming the lives of thousands of Black men, women, and children between Reconstruction and the mid-20th century. The Equal Justice Initiative estimates that 4,400 lynchings took place during this time period, which was also characterized by legalized segregation, mass disenfranchisement, economic coercion, and sexual violence perpetrated against Black women. And yet, when anti-lynching bills appeared before Congress—again and again—white leaders defended ritualized, spectacular acts of racial terror as a regrettable but necessary response to generally false claims of sexual violence by Black men against white women.

This “rape-lynch” mythology “that Negro men rape white women” was a “threadbare lie,” as journalist Ida B. Wells painstakingly documented in 1892, and she was almost murdered for speaking the truth. But truth was never the point. The claim of self-defense functioned as a form of camouflage to shroud the economic, political, and social project of keeping Black Americans subordinate under a blanket of legitimacy. It worked because enough people were willing to accept it, to pretend that racial terror was necessary to (white) public safety.

A similarly pernicious logic has insulated law enforcement from legal accountability for generations. Police violence, no matter how extreme, is routinely reframed as a defensive reaction to a threat rather than aggression. “The officer feared for his life.” “The suspect was reaching … for something.” “The situation escalated quickly, and the officer had no choice but to shoot.” The language is reflexive, ritualized, and remarkably effective. It is baked into our nation’s DNA to frame the victims of state-sanctioned violence as perpetrators.

In recent decades, that logic has been codified into law and expanded to select citizens through “Stand Your Ground” laws and permissive gun regulations that collapse the distinction between defense and dominance. These laws encourage armed confrontation while removing the legal duty to retreat or de-escalate. They transform subjective fear into legal justification while inviting ordinary citizens to imagine themselves as lone sentinels in a hostile world, as heroic “good guys with guns,” and as “armed citizens” exercising their Second Amendment rights. The laws reward those who act on that fantasy with legal immunity.

But only when they are acting in the service of repressive power. By all accounts, including the video evidence, Alex Pretti was a law-abiding good guy with a gun, who stepped in to protect an unarmed woman from an assault. He did not draw his weapon, nor did he attack the agents who disarmed him before shooting him multiple times while he was pinned to the ground.

What is new today is not the twisted rhetoric of self-defense but its escalation, and its targets. Masked federal agents, many of them poorly trained, now patrol public streets with military-grade weapons and broad discretionary authority. They detain, assault, and, increasingly, kill people based on vague or erroneous claims of public safety. They do so while invoking the same exonerating language that has long enabled state violence.

For generations, public state violence has been normalized precisely because it was disproportionately inflicted on nonwhite people, immigrants, low-income and other marginalized individuals. Many learned to look away or to justify this violence as the necessary price of “law and order.” Part of race and class privilege was the capacity to see such violence as a regrettable but necessary byproduct of maintaining order and keeping “us” safe.

We are now witnessing—some of us in incredulous horror—what happens when a society confuses authority with innocence and violence with virtue. We have built legal doctrines that reward escalation. We have granted weapons to institutions without demanding restraint. We have taught ourselves that “good guys” with guns will keep us safe from “bad guys.” Maybe now we are learning that the boundary separating the two was never clear in the first place.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">This is part of a series of on-the-ground reports from Minneapolis.

On Thursday, I ended my day on day care patrol as the windchill crept close to 25 degrees below zero. The patrols began after Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents appeared at my son’s day care two weeks ago; that same day, a day care worker for the same provider was taken by agents at a nearby location while trying to come into work. During my recent patrol, ICE officers were spotted in the neighborhood, as they nearly always are, but everybody made it out of the building safely.

As I write this, a helicopter is circling over my neighborhood, as happens most days now. My phone is pinging near constantly with alerts from Signal groups that exist to defend and support our community. A friend texted to ask how concerned we should be that the president will invoke the Insurrection Act and send the military into our city; my husband just learned that workers at a nearby small business were taken by the government; a friend’s school went on lockdown today because ICE was nearby.

Our neighborhood has never been more united, but you wouldn’t know it from how few people are out on the streets. Nobody opens their door anymore, knowing that the next knock might be a federal agent demanding to know where the brown people live in your neighborhood. People are making a point to support immigrant-owned restaurants, but you have to check if they’re open before you go, because so many aren’t. Folks are out delivering food and essentials to neighbors who are unable to leave their homes for fear, but they have to be careful to use a different car from the one they drive when they’re observing ICE because the government is tracking license plates.

Earlier this week, students in our city lost two days of learning because schools closed—the teachers needed time to shift to the virtual learning model, which began Thursday. This time, it’s not because of an unknown and deadly illness; it’s because the government is attacking our students. People are being shipped out of the state so fast that their families don’t have time to get to their holding cell with the paperwork proving they’re legally authorized to be here before they’re gone.

The horrors have not ceased since Renee Good’s death; instead, they have increased. Protesters are being attacked and shot. On Tuesday, a 5-year-old was detained by ICE and used to bait his family into leaving their home. The preschooler and his father have now been sent to Texas, and it is unclear if or when they’ll return. On Thursday, multiple civil rights leaders, including St. Paul School Board member Chauntyll Allen, were arrested for exercising their First Amendment right to protest, in a Department of Justice action that, according to the NAACP, was a likely violation of those First Amendment rights. And on Saturday, Alex Pretti was killed by ICE agents, shot multiple times at close range. Every day, there is a new horror to process, a new way in which the federal government inflicts irreparable harm on our community.

I serve as a St. Paul City Council member, and our community is under a violent attack at the hands of the federal government. And so we are fighting back in all the ways we know how.

On Jan. 12, St. Paul announced a joint lawsuit with the city of Minneapolis and the state of Minnesota against the Department of Homeland Security, seeking to end this unconstitutional operation. Our City Council is working to strengthen our separation ordinance and develop other legal tools to make sure that our city resources—including our police department—cannot and will not support the work of immigration enforcement. We are calling on the governor to declare a state of emergency and enact a statewide eviction moratorium to ensure that nobody loses their home because the federal government is making it impossible for them to earn a living. Every elected official in our city is working to connect our residents with whatever support they need right now. We are also demanding that Congress act—that our representatives and senators use every tool at their disposal to end this occupation—because neither cities nor states alone have enough tools to protect our people from the federal government.

None of this feels like enough. Individually, none of it is. But what we know from other countries that have successfully defeated authoritarianism is that democratic resurgence is possible. Over the past 30 years, 52 percent of “autocratization episodes” were followed by democratic resurgence. In 90 percent of those cases, countries were ultimately as or more democratic than they were previously.

In St. Paul and across Minnesota, we’re showing that we have what it will take to win. We are cultivating solidarity and pushing back through every channel that we have—and building more capacity to fight for our community every day. We are demonstrating our commitment to nonviolence, even in the face of incredible levels of violence being used against us. We might get tired, but we are not succumbing to despair. Our civil resistance movement is strong, and it is growing.

Most importantly, we know what we’re fighting for, because we’ve already lived it. St. Paul has always been at its strongest when we’ve embraced our immigrant neighbors. Minnesota has always been at its best when we’ve built structures that allow everybody in our state to flourish, whether they’ve been here for months or for generations. This is a place where we take seriously Paul Wellstone’s immortal words “We all do better when we all do better.” The cruel, painful world that Donald Trump is trying to force on us is not one that we will ever, ever settle for. The path ahead is not clear, but we will continue to put one foot in front of the other until the day we win.

            <div id="article-text">More than 400 tech workers have urged their CEOs to &quot;call the White House and demand ICE leave our cities&quot; after masked federal agents shot and killed Alex Pretti over the weekend and the world&#39;s richest and most powerful chief executives remained silent.

In October, when President Trump threatened to send federal law enforcement to San Francisco, tech leaders reportedly called the White House and Trump reversed course, telling reporters that phone calls from Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang and Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff had changed his mind.

Meanwhile, US Immigration and Customs Enforcement and National Guard troops were deployed to other cities, including Portland, Los Angeles, Chicago, and Minneapolis, where federal agents have now shot and killed two people, Pretti and Renee Good, this month.

The tech industry&#39;s C-suite has yet to publicly speak out against these recent fatal shootings involving federal agents - or the larger dismantling of democracy and the international order under the Trump administration - but their employees are, with hundreds of workers from Amazon, Apple, Google, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia, Salesforce, and many, many other companies demanding ICE leave American cities.

&quot;This cannot continue, and we know the tech industry can make a difference,&quot; according to the ICEout tech petition that calls on CEOs to do three things:

As of mid-Monday, about 450 tech employees had signed the letter.

The Register contacted 16 companies (Amazon, Apple, Cisco, Cloudflare, Google, IBM, Lyft, Intel, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia, Okta, OpenAI, PayPal, Salesforce, and Stripe) whose employees signed their support for the ICEout efforts and asked if their CEOs planned to take any of the above actions.

None of them immediately responded to our inquiries.

On Sunday, more than 60 CEOs of large Minnesota-based companies, including 3M, Best Buy, General Mills, Target, and UnitedHealth, signed an open letter &quot;calling for an immediate deescalation of tensions and for state, local and federal officials to work together to find real solutions.&quot; ®

            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2026/01/26/workplace_ai_adoption_falls_flat/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">AI adoption in the workplace stalled in the fourth quarter of 2025, but those who have already started using it are making increased use of it, according to a survey by pollster Gallup. Don&#39;t let that fool you into thinking AI is taking over work, though: frequent AI users are still a tiny minority of overall workers.

Sharp increases in the workplace usage of AI throughout the year almost entirely leveled off between Q3 and Q4 2025, Gallup reported over the weekend. The total percentage of workers using AI climbed just a single percentage point in the final three months of the year, from 45 percent in Q3 to 46 percent. Similarly, respondents noting that their company had adopted AI hovered at 38 percent in Q4 – just a single percentage point higher than Q3 adoption numbers.

That said, while AI adoption and usage were flat over the final quarter of 2025, the number of workers reporting frequent and daily usage of AI did increase.

There was a three percent increase in frequent AI usage, defined as being a few times a week, and a two percent increase in daily AI usage. While greater than the overall one percent increase, those changes are still small, and it&#39;s also worth noting they comprise a vast minority of AI users overall. Per the responses, only 26 percent of workers are using AI frequently, and just 12 percent are using it daily.

So who&#39;s jumping aboard? The results there aren&#39;t surprising either.

Per Gallup, knowledge-based industries are dominating in AI usage, with the tech sector particularly fond of it – 77 percent of tech professionals report using AI in the workplace, with 57 percent doing so frequently and 31 percent using AI daily. University workers and finance professionals are also high adopters.

Interestingly enough, workers in &quot;remote-capable&quot; roles, which Gallup defines as jobs that &quot;could reasonably be completed remotely regardless of where the employee actually works,&quot; are big fans of AI, with 66 percent of them reporting using it in Q4. Far fewer employees in non-remote capable positions report using AI – just 32 percent – though that could be the nature of their jobs, as Gallup notes remote positions tend to be desk and office-based, while on-site jobs often involve more physical work.

Leadership positions, which Gallup defines separately from managers and individual contributors and which tend to be desk- and office-based roles, are also more likely to use AI than other workers, the pollster said, while noting the gap between leadership and rest-of-the-workplace AI usage has widened in recent years.

Taken as a whole, Gallup argues that the growing divide between users and non-users, and stagnating expansion, means that AI has a use-case problem.

&quot;Gallup research shows that lack of utility is the most common barrier to individual AI use, suggesting that clear AI use cases may be more apparent for leaders than employees in other roles,&quot; the polling agency concluded of its Q4 numbers.

&quot;This underscores the importance of grounding decisions about AI adoption in a clear understanding of how AI may be applied to different roles and functions, not just among those closest to decision-making,&quot; Gallup added.

In other words, the C-suite ought to start thinking outside its own experience on AI adoption, because the average employee doesn&#39;t seem to find it particularly useful. That, or they&#39;re realizing AI isn&#39;t saving them any time, and may even be eating up more of it. ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Agents may be the next big thing in AI, but they have limits beyond which they will make mistakes, so exercise extreme caution, a recent research paper says.

According to a definition by IBM, agentic AI consists of software agents that mimic human decision-making to solve problems in real time, and this builds on generative AI techniques by using large language models (LLMs) to function in dynamic environments.

But while the industry hype machine pushes agentic AI as the next big thing, potential adopters should be wary, as the paper, &quot;Hallucination Stations: On Some Basic Limitations of Transformer-Based Language Models&quot; [PDF] argues that LLMs are incapable of carrying out computational and agentic tasks beyond a certain complexity level, above which they will deliver incorrect responses.

The paper uses mathematical reasoning to show that if a prompt to an LLM specifies a computational task whose complexity is higher than that of the LLM&#39;s own core operations, then the LLM will in general respond incorrectly.

Essentially, the argument of the authors is that it is possible to present an LLM with an input specifying a task that requires more calculations than it is capable of performing.

This has relevance to agentic AI because there is considerable interest of late in the technology&#39;s potential role in automating various tasks across a range of applications, from those that simply involve providing information, to others that have real-world effects, such as making financial transactions or controlling and managing industrial equipment.

Furthermore, the paper claims to show that deploying agents to verify the correctness of another agent&#39;s solution for a given task will also fail for the same reasons, because verification of a task is often more complex than the task itself.

&quot;We believe this case to be especially pertinent since one of the most prevalent applications of LLMs is to write and verify software,&quot; the authors state.

The paper, which was published last year but seems to have gone largely unnoticed until flagged by tech publication Wired, was written by Varin Sikka and Vishal Sikka. The latter was formerly CTO of SAP and CEO of Infosys, and currently the founder of AI company Vianai Systems.

The conclusion the paper reaches is that &quot;despite their obvious power and applicability in various domains, extreme care must be used before applying LLMs to problems or use cases that require accuracy, or solving problems of non-trivial complexity.&quot;

In other words, this doesn&#39;t mean that AI agents will necessarily be a disaster, but anyone developing and deploying such solutions needs to be mindful of whether assigned tasks exceed the underlying model&#39;s effective complexity limits.

As The Register reported recently, for example, scientists at the US Department of Energy&#39;s Sandia National Labs made use of AI assistants to develop a novel approach for steering LED light, showing that the technology has promise.

However, the risks posed by such agents are top of mind for many top execs, even featuring in a panel discussion on cyber threats at the WEF in Davos recently.

Last year, research firm Gartner even forecast that more than 40 percent of agentic AI projects are set to be cancelled by the end of 2027, citing reasons including escalating costs, unclear business value, and insufficient risk controls.

Work on mitigating these unfortunate limitations of LLMs is ongoing, the paper notes, with approaches including composite systems and constraining the models. ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The internet spent the closing months of 2025 being knocked over by cut cables, broken power grids, bad weather, military strikes, and the occasional self-inflicted technical wound, according to Cloudflare&#39;s latest global traffic data.

Cloudflare&#39;s calendar Q4 snapshot of global connectivity reads like a reminder of how often the internet still gets cut off for very ordinary reasons. Across 2025 as a whole, the company tracked more than 180 significant disruptions, with the final quarter dominated by cable damage, power problems, and routine operational failures.

There was just one confirmed government-directed shutdown during the period. Tanzania saw a sharp drop in internet traffic on October 29 as violent protests broke out during the country&#39;s presidential election, with traffic falling by more than 90 percent. Traffic returned briefly before declining again, and routing data pointed to throttling rather than a clean shutdown.

Most of the quarter&#39;s disruption, however, had nothing to do with politics. Cable cuts continued to do what they always do. In Haiti, Digicel was hit twice after international fiber was severed, sending traffic on its network close to zero before repairs were completed. Damage to the PEACE cable disrupted international connectivity for Pakistan, while faults on the West Africa Cable System caused repeated outages across Cameroon and nearby countries.

Electricity failures proved just as effective at knocking the internet sideways. The Dominican Republic lost a big chunk of its internet traffic after a transmission line outage spiralled into a nationwide blackout. Kenya ran into its own problems after a fault on the regional grid link with Uganda, leaving connectivity sluggish for hours even as the lights came back on.

Armed conflict also left a visible mark on connectivity. Russian drone strikes damaged energy infrastructure in Ukraine&#39;s Odesa region in mid-December, cutting power and pushing local internet traffic down by as much as 57 percent. Connectivity only crept back over the following days.

Internet traffic in Jamaica dropped sharply after Hurricane Melissa made landfall in late October and remained below normal for several days. Cyclone Senyar caused flooding and landslides in Sri Lanka and Indonesia that disrupted power and telecommunications across multiple regions.

Some of the quarter&#39;s outages had far less dramatic causes. Vodafone UK managed to knock itself offline in October, with traffic across two autonomous systems falling to zero and no public explanation from the company. Fastweb in Italy ran into a DNS problem the same month that cut traffic by more than 75 percent for several hours. Providers in Israel and Indonesia saw similar DNS failures, underlining how a broken resolver can look, to users, exactly like the internet disappearing.

Cloudflare added its own entries to the outage list, with two internal incidents during the quarter that made sites and apps unreachable. AWS and Microsoft Azure had regional problems too, causing knock-on performance issues for customers who&#39;ve built on their platforms.

The Q4 data shows little has changed about how the internet fails. In the end, Q4 offered few surprises. The internet kept falling over in the same places it usually does, and when it did, the damage tended to travel. ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">KDE Plasma 6.6 is approaching, and one of its more controversial changes is a new login screen that depends on systemd – meaning that it won&#39;t work on the non-Linux operating systems KDE still nominally supports.

The first beta is now available. The KDE project has published a full changelog covering the differences between the current Plasma 6.5.5 release and what&#39;s internally known as Plasma 6.5.90, although, at nearly 2,500 lines, it&#39;s not exactly light reading. The KDE Wiki has a more digestible list that summarizes just under 40 significant changes.

One of these looks relatively inconspicuous. There&#39;s a new login screen called the Plasma Login Manager, which is forked from the existing SDDM. SDDM stands for Simple Desktop Display Manager and as the Arch Wiki describes: &quot;It is the recommended display manager for the LXQt desktop environment.&quot;

However, the Plasma Login Manager depends upon the systemd-logind service. It will only work on Linux distros that use systemd; indeed, the developers of the new project explicitly dropped FreeBSD support in December 2025. The developers have defended the move in a Reddit discussion, and don&#39;t look likely to change their minds. This isn&#39;t stopping distros adopting it: it&#39;s already available in Arch Linux and the performance-oriented Arch variant CachyOS&#39;s new January 2026 release defaults to using the Plasma Login Manager.

This does not mean that KDE Plasma 6.6 as a whole will require systemd. There&#39;s no particularly close connection between any graphical login screen and whatever desktop or desktops it launches. For a Qt-based login manager, SDDM itself is still around, and there are lots of alternatives available. GhostBSD uses the Gtk-based LightDM, as do many Linux distros. On FreeBSD, the old but simple SLiM is a common choice, although its long unmaintained upstream, and the developer of the continuation SLiM fork reported serious health problems.

Even so, this is suggestive for the future direction of the KDE Plasma project. As we reported back in November, KDE&#39;s stated future direction is to go Wayland-only. Wayland already works on FreeBSD, and that includes in KDE Plasma. That shouldn&#39;t be a problem.

Support on the other BSDs is more preliminary. OpenBSD developer Matthieu Herrb reported that he had it running [PDF] back in 2023. Even earlier it was possible to run it on NetBSD, and we do like that developer&#39;s later summary: &quot;The bad news is that to have applications running we require access to a larger open source ecosystem, and that ecosystem has a lot of churn and is easily distracted by shiny new squirrels.&quot;

Calling Wayland a &quot;shiny new squirrel&quot; seems quite charitable to us. We feel that decisions like these, to favor Linux-centric tech such as systemd and Wayland, do represent the general direction of the GNOME and KDE projects. GNOME 49 came out in September 2025 and developer Adrian Vovk, whose work on GNOME OS we mentioned in 2024, earlier in 2025 explicitly said that future releases would be introducing stronger dependencies on systemd.

Among the BSDs, only FreeBSD and OpenBSD offer recent versions of the big two. In 2024, we reported on OpenBSD getting KDE Plasma 5, and last October&#39;s OpenBSD 7.8 offers KDE Plasma 6.4.5. We fear this will become more difficult for them as both GNOME and KDE become increasingly Linux-centric.

In July 2025, we reported that FreeBSD 15 would offer a minimal KDE desktop. That didn&#39;t make it in, but the team is still working on it – it&#39;s on the roadmap for 15.1.

In our humble opinion, perhaps the FreeBSD contributors should divert the targets of their efforts elsewhere – to a project less distracted by shiny new squirrels. Our suggestion would be the desktop whose release schedule has a similar cadence to their own: Xfce.

In 1982, the comic strip Frank and Ernest coined the line generally paraphrased as &quot;Of course, Fred Astaire was a wonderful dancer, but Ginger Rogers did everything he did backwards and in high heels.&quot; Well, Xfce does everything that the bigger headline-hogging desktops do, but it does it quicker, in less code and with less memory. ®

            <div id="article-text">Alaska Air&#39;s CEO says IT outages last year damaged the company on multiple fronts despite &quot;triple redundancies&quot; built into its disaster recovery plan.

The airline&#39;s systems failed twice in 2025 - once in July and again in October - forcing Alaska to ground its fleet on both occasions. Tech failures led to hundreds of flight cancellations.

On a conference call with analysts at the end of last week, CEO Benito Minicucci addressed what the company learned from its IT audit and how it plans to prevent future outages.

&quot;The two outages we experienced last year were painful for our guests, employees and financial results,&quot; he said. &quot;It&#39;s not for a lack of investment. We were investing in IT. I think it was more of a configuration. We had hardware failures. We had backup systems and triple redundancies that didn&#39;t kick in.&quot;

A failure at Alaska&#39;s primary datacenter in October knocked out operational systems and grounded planes, it said at the time.

The airline has now brought in third-party experts to &quot;really understand how to take this investment we&#39;re making... to really address the configuration of our infrastructure so that we stay resilient to a high degree.&quot;

&quot;Corrective actions are underway and will continue throughout the year, supported by third-party experts as we invest in both near-term fixes and long-term sustainable solutions,&quot; Minicucci said.

The outages carried financial consequences. Passenger revenue rose just 2 percent year-over-year in Q4 to $3.25 billion, while net income dropped to $20 million from $71 million a year earlier.

Minicucci said that financial results were &quot;impacted by the IT outage, elevated fuel costs and the impact from government shutdowns.&quot;

Alaska&#39;s longer-term plans may include migrating to cloud computing. &quot;If there&#39;s migration to the cloud and stuff, we&#39;ll get you guys up to speed on what we&#39;re doing,&quot; he told analysts.

Phew. Thank goodness the cloud never goes down. Maybe Alaska Airline should be safe and work with three providers. ®

            <div id="article-text">﻿After immigration agents killed a second person in Minneapolis, anti-ICE sentiment has reached every corner of the internet — including adult subreddits.

﻿After immigration agents killed a second person in Minneapolis, anti-ICE sentiment has reached every corner of the internet — including adult subreddits.

“Fuck ICE first, second, third, and fourth. Then worry about fucking me,” a Reddit post reads. “Immigrants of any status are my friends, neighbors, and colleagues.”

Across the internet — and in the streets — the sentiment is unavoidable, especially after a federal immigration agent shot and killed Alex Pretti, a 37-year-old nurse, in Minneapolis on Saturday. The killing came just weeks after an immigration agent shot and killed another person, Renee Good, who federal officials smeared as a “domestic terrorist” with no evidence. This Reddit post’s message would fit right in in online spaces for countless hobbies, interests, and creators: anti-ICE discussions are happening everywhere from r/Military to cat subreddits. Except this time, it was posted to an adult forum.

r/MassiveCock is a subreddit that is primarily photos of users’ penises. Prior to this weekend, the forum was largely apolitical: a place for users to sext or promote their OnlyFans accounts. Over the weekend, peppered between the usual dick pics, some posts began to take an explicitly anti-ICE stance.

“How hard I get when I think about abolishing ICE,” one post reads, accompanied by a photo to demonstrate. “Sorry, I was just thinking about ICE agents rotting behind bars for the rest of their lives,” says another post with a photo.

A user who goes by tomatoe1987 posted one of the “Fuck ICE” messages in the subreddit that became one of the top submissions over the weekend. The user, who requested anonymity because he’s a private person, says he’s active in adult subreddits that he primarily uses to meet people and to show off. He told The Verge that he’s moderately politically active — always votes, has attended a few rallies — but doesn’t consider himself an activist of any kind. His Reddit account is his main platform, and he says he has zero social media in his personal life outside of it.

“ICE events have been having a devastating effect on my community, friends, and colleagues.”

“I admit I find what I did to be a little (very) silly,” he said in a message to The Verge. “There’s certainly a large element of what I did that was just to vent frustration in the only public way I could. ICE events have been having a devastating effect on my community, friends, and colleagues.”

There are several dozen “Fuck ICE” or similar posts in the subreddit as of Monday, some with hundreds of comments.

Many of the comments under tomatoe1987’s post were supportive of his anti-ICE statement, but there were, of course, complaints along the lines of “Why bring politics into sex?”

“Someone else said to me that nothing in life should feel ‘normal’ when these sorts of things are happening in our country. Even porn and sex,” he said. “All of it should make supporters of unchecked political violence and fascism uncomfortable.” He also said it was a way to reject the assumption that because he posts on “dominant, physically imposing styled subreddits” that he has certain political leanings or lacks empathy.

“I hope at least a few people that pay attention to me see that you can be ‘manly’ and still have compassion for fellow human beings,” tomatoe1987 said.

Politics and sex have always been deeply intertwined, of course, and adult content online is increasingly under attack, including via age verification laws that critics say are ineffective at keeping adult content away from minors, but that have a chilling effect on free speech and raise privacy concerns. In the UK, Reddit requires users to verify their age by uploading a selfie or a photo of their ID before they access some mature content, though users have figured out ways to bypass the verification process.

ICE has become a topic of conversation in other adult subreddits. A moderator of r/RandomActsofBlowJob (exactly what it sounds like) posted on Sunday that “Fuck ICE” was the subreddit’s “stance on what’s going on regarding immigration enforcement.” (A related subreddit also had the same stance.) There’s also been debate over the ethics of continuing to run a fascist kink subreddit in an age of violent state repression.

tomatoe1987 says he has no idea if anti-ICE content will stick in r/MassiveCock. For now it’s simply “a little bit of day to day hope,” he says. “Just letting people know that there’s a lot of people out there who are concerned about their safety and well-being.”

            <div id="article-text">The platform is using AI to repurpose old films for mobile, but its first effort is an awkward fit for the format.﻿

The platform is using AI to repurpose old films for mobile, but its first effort is an awkward fit for the format.﻿

Most vertical video microdrama apps have been focused on putting out newly produced series meant to be watched on your phone. But Tattle TV thinks that people might also be interested in checking out bite-size pieces of cinematic history.

Though Tattle TV — a UK-based streaming platform created by filmmakers Philip McGoldrick and Marina Elderton — features a reality dating series about dog owners and a modern drama about a female MMA fighter, the company’s latest debut is a vertically oriented edit of Alfred Hitchcock’s silent film The Lodger: A Story of the London Fog.

Similar to other microdrama apps, Tattle TV splits all of its content into short segments that can be purchased individually using an in-app currency (Tattle Coins) that you buy using actual money. The platform also offers monthly and yearly subscriptions for $3.99 and $29.99, respectively, and Reward Coins — which are essentially the same as regular Tattle Coins — can be obtained by “engaging with fun activities” like watching advertisements.

Tattle TV’s content library is relatively scant right now, and its vertical spin on The Lodger is only available in the US (where the film is part of the public domain) due to licensing restrictions. But in a recent interview with Deadline, Elderton said that the company has plans to flesh out its catalog by obtaining the rights to other British classics like Monty Python and The Crystal Maze.

“Repurposing recognizable shows would be such an interesting introduction to what a vertical is,” Elderton explained. “There is a huge proportion of the British population who don’t know what verticals are and if we can access those audiences as well as verticals fans then that is a bit of a goldmine.”

Watching The Lodger on Tattle TV is a rather odd experience because there are many elements of the movie, like its original aspect ratio, that simply weren’t designed for the vertical format. While you can still get the gist of the story thanks to intertitle cards, many actors are essentially cropped out of the film in order to keep your focus on main characters Daisy Bunting (June Tripp) and Jonathan Drew / The Lodger (Ivor Novello). Tattle TV’s version of The Lodger is also scored with music that sounds more like the ominous stuff you hear in trailers for contemporary thrillers as opposed to the type of music silent films are typically accompanied by.

Tattle TV’s format and interstitial ads make it hard to get lost in The Lodger’s fantasy. But McGoldrick is confident that, because the company is “an early adopter of cutting-edge AI tools,” it’s in a prime position to quickly produce more vertical editions of classic movies and shows that people will be interested in watching. The company probably can crank out a few more of these things if it can secure the right permissions, but as they currently exist, it’s a little hard to imagine these verticals capturing people’s imaginations.

﻿Anthropic’s one step closer to having an everything app.

Anthropic’s Claude got a bit livelier today thanks to a new extension to MCP, the open-source protocol that allows AI agents to easily access tools and data across the internet. Users will now be able to interact with apps directly inside the Claude chatbot, letting you draft and format Slack messages to colleagues and create presentations for clients in Canva without having to switch tabs.

As of today, Anthropic said tools like Asana, Figma, Slack, and Canva will “open as interactive apps right inside of chat.” While users could previously connect tools like Slack and Asana to the AI assistant, doing so meant getting text back. The company says the new in-app integration means users can actually engage with the tool and “see, explore, and refine results visually, not just read about them.”

A number of popular tools are already available to use directly in Claude. Anthropic says users can customize Canva decks in real time, format and preview Slack messages, build interactive charts with Hex or Amplitude, and manage projects with Asana or monday.com. There are also integrations for Figma, Clay, and Box, Anthropic said, with Salesforce tools like Data 360, Agentforce, and Customer 360 apps “coming soon.”

The interactivity — something of apps-within-an-app — sounds similar to the “mini” apps embedded inside messaging platforms like Telegram and Discord. The integration signals a shift in how AI platforms like ChatGPT and Claude are likely to operate in the future, becoming more like operating systems than individual tools, an “everything app” in the vein of Tencent’s WeChat in China. ChatGPT has already made a step in that direction with the launch of its own app ecosystem last year.

Anthropic credited the Model Context Protocol, or MCP, for the ability to integrate apps into Claude. The extension, called MCP Apps, “lets any MCP server deliver an interactive interface within any supporting AI product — not just Claude,” meaning other interactive app interfaces could soon be on the way to other AI tools.

Operating standards like MCP are crucial for building usable ecosystems of products as they avoid the need for companies to develop and maintain numerous different interfaces. MCP began life at Anthropic in 2024 but has been widely adopted by companies including OpenAI, Google, and Microsoft. Anthropic donated it to the Linux foundation late last year and established a new fund — the Agentic AI Foundation — with other tech giants like OpenAI, Google, Microsoft, AWS, Block, Bloomberg, and Cloudflare, to “advance open-source agentic AI.”

TikTok’s takeover in the US has prompted users to join an alternative social platform called UpScrolled. The app, which is available on Android and iOS, currently holds the 12th spot in Apple’s App Store, and it’s struggling to keep up with an influx of new traffic.

“You showed up so fast our servers tapped out,” UpScrolled writes in a post on Bluesky, adding that it’s working to get things up and running. Several users, including journalist Taylor Lorenz, have said that they’re making the switch to UpScrolled after Oracle and a group of investors took over TikTok’s US operations last week, sparking concerns about censorship. On top of that, US-based users began experiencing issues with the app following the takeover, which TikTok blamed on a power outage at one of its data centers.

UpScrolled was founded in 2025 by Issam Hijazi, a Palestinian-Jordanian-Australian technologist, with the goal of giving users the ability to “freely express thoughts,” while “ensuring every post has a fair chance to be seen.” Its website says the platform will remain “impartial” to political agendas, won’t shadowban users or content, and will “uphold social responsibility.” The app’s interface looks like a mix between Instagram and X, allowing you to post and discover photos, videos, and text posts, as well as write private messages to other users.

This isn’t the first time we’ve seen such a large call to switch to alternative social networks, as TikTokers flocked to apps like RedNote in response to the TikTok ban last year, while other networks, like Bluesky and Mastodon, emerged as popular spots for people looking to get away from X.

            <div id="article-text">Social media companies discussed the big business — and risks — of young users in documents released ahead of a major trial.

Social media companies discussed the big business — and risks — of young users in documents released ahead of a major trial.

Recently released documents show the big business opportunity that social media companies saw in recruiting teens to their platforms and how they discussed risks that heavy digital engagement could pose.

The documents were released last week as part of a major set of trials brought by school districts, state attorneys general, and others against Meta, Snap, TikTok and YouTube, alleging the design of their products harmed young users. The Tech Oversight Project, which advocates for more regulations on tech platforms to safeguard teens online, compiled a report on the newly released documents, which were independently reviewed by The Verge. On Monday, a federal judge will hear arguments that will determine the scope of the trials, the first of which kicks off in June.

The internal documents produced as part of the litigation show that social media companies recognized business value in establishing users at a young age. But they also show how the companies tracked harmful effects that features could have on those users and considered ways to address those risks. The companies have all expressed a commitment to safeguarding teens on their platforms and generally complained that evidence presented by the plaintiffs lacks relevant context. Meta, for example, launched a webpage that responds to FAQs about the litigation and lists research that describes the other factors impacting teens’ mental health, or finding minimal association between teens’ use of digital platforms and their mental well-being.

Some emails and slides demonstrate just how valuable some of the companies saw teen users for growing their business. “Mark [Zuckerberg] has decided that the top priority for the company in H1 2017 is teens,” a redacted sender said in an email to Meta’s then-growth executive Guy Rosen with the subject line “FYI: Teen Growth!!” at the end of 2016. It later discussed a teen ambassador program for Instagram and considered formalizing teens’ tendency to make Finstas by introducing a private mode for Facebook that drew on what teens liked about making alternative Instagram accounts: “smaller audiences, plausible deniability, and private accounts.”

“Solving Kids is a Massive Opportunity,” the title of a November 2020 slide from Google said, citing that “Kids under 13 are the fastest-growing Internet audience in the world.” Its internal research found family users “lead to better retention and more overall value.” The company recognized that getting students to use Chromebooks in school made them more likely to consider buying Google products down the road. Google spokesperson Jack Malon told The Verge in a previous statement that “YouTube does not market directly to schools and we have responded to meet the strong demand from educators for high-quality, curriculum-aligned content.”

Some of the companies discussed the PR risks involved in having young users on their platforms. Emails from 2016 show Meta discussing public perception and safety risks around the launch of its short-lived under-21 app Lifestage. Employees weighed the potential risks of giving administrators at the high schools where it planned to launch a heads-up, versus the potential to ruin the “‘cool’ factor” of the app by cluing them in. One raised a concern about how tricky it would be to know if only actual teens were on the app. “[W]e can’t enforce against impersonation/predators/press if we don’t have a way to verify accounts.” In a February 2018 document, Meta recognized it may have to delay letting tweens on Facebook because of “increased scrutiny of whether Facebook is good for Youth.”

A 2018 deck produced by Google titled “Digital Wellness Overview - YT Autoplay” notes that “Tech addiction and Google’s role has been making the news and has gained prominence since ‘time well spent’ movement started.” It said that autoplay may be “disrupting sleep patterns” and suggested limiting it at night could help (autoplay is now turned off for kids under 18).

The companies were aware of research and anecdotes describing kids using their platforms below the age they should be allowed to, or at times they shouldn’t. A 2017 study commissioned by Snap found 64 percent of users 13-21 used it in school. In a highly redacted chat log from February 2020 produced from TikTok’s records, one person in the chat said they’re “sort of glad” that news crews ended up not being able to make it to a public event where students on the panel they were watching were “primarily under 13” and discussing “how they know they’re not supposed to have an account.”

But the documents also show the ways the companies considered the unique challenges their younger users would face on their platforms and discussed how to mitigate them. A March 2023 slide deck from Snap describes a recent study it worked on “to understand the perceptions of social media from Users, Parents’ and Wellness Experts in order to identify new opportunities to foster positive interactions on and perceptions of Snapchat.” After finding many teens reported being on social media “all the time,” the company suggested considering letting users turn off social media during school hours, or setting their own time limits in the app. “From the beginning, Snap considered how time, content, and online interactions influence real-life relationships,” Snap spokesperson Monique Bellamy said in a statement. “We deliberately designed Snapchat to create a unique experience that encourages self-expression, visual communication, and authentic, real-time conversations, rather than promoting endless passive consumption.”

A 2021 document from TikTok recognized that compulsive use of its platform was “rampant,” but said that meant it needed to provide users “better tools to understand their usage, manage it effectively, and ensure being on TikTok is time well spent.” The company saw it as a good thing that TikTok users were more actively engaged on their app than on other platforms, since “research suggests passive use of social media is more harmful.” TikTok did not immediately provide a comment on the latest document release.

In the 2016 email to Meta’s Rosen, the redacted sender wrote that the goal was to emphasize “teen:teen connections” and they wanted to find a way “for teens newly joining FB to indicate whether a person who they are friending is or is not a peer (aka another teen).” They also added that Meta was “heavily investing in improving our ability to model actual age of teens.”

Some safeguards may actually be good for business, executives sometimes suggested. Google, in a 2019 document, proposed disincentivizing “growth that doesn’t support wellbeing,” recognizing that investing in users’ digital well-being would be positive for its brand and “a more sustainable path for growth.”

OpenAI is reportedly asking a high price to advertise on ChatGPT, around $60 per 1,000 views, or triple what ads on Meta’s platform usually cost, according to The Information.

Despite the higher price, OpenAI won’t be offering advertisers the same level of detailed information that Google and Meta do, such as whether users took any action in response to seeing an ad on ChatGPT, like making a purchase. Early advertisers on ChatGPT will only get “high-level” data on how their ads perform, like total ad views or total clicks.

OpenAI could give advertisers more details down the line, but when it announced ads in ChatGPT earlier this month, OpenAI promised users that it will “never sell your data to advertisers” and will keep ChatGPT conversations private. The first ads on ChatGPT will begin appearing in the coming weeks for users on the chatbot’s free and lower-tier Go plans, except for users under 18 and chats covering sensitive topics like mental health or politics.

            <h2>Inside OpenAI’s big play for science</h2>
            <p><strong>MIT Technology Review | 2026-01-26</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2026/01/26/1131728/inside-openais-big-play-for-science/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">In the three years since ChatGPT’s explosive debut, OpenAI’s technology has upended a remarkable range of everyday activities at home, at work, in schools—anywhere people have a browser open or a phone out, which is everywhere.

Now OpenAI is making an explicit play for scientists. In October, the firm announced that it had launched a whole new team, called OpenAI for Science, dedicated to exploring how its large language models could help scientists and tweaking its tools to support them.

The last couple of months have seen a slew of social media posts and academic publications in which mathematicians, physicists, biologists, and others have described how LLMs (and OpenAI’s GPT-5 in particular) have helped them make a discovery or nudged them toward a solution they might otherwise have missed. In part, OpenAI for Science was set up to engage with this community.

And yet OpenAI is also late to the party. Google DeepMind, the rival firm behind groundbreaking scientific models such as AlphaFold and AlphaEvolve, has had an AI-for-science team for years. (When I spoke to Google DeepMind’s CEO and cofounder Demis Hassabis in 2023 about that team, he told me: “This is the reason I started DeepMind … In fact, it’s why I’ve worked my whole career in AI.”)

So why now? How does a push into science fit with OpenAI’s wider mission? And what exactly is the firm hoping to achieve?

I put these questions to Kevin Weil, a vice president at OpenAI who leads the new OpenAI for Science team, in an exclusive interview last week.

Weil is a product guy. He joined OpenAI a couple of years ago as chief product officer after being head of product at Twitter and Instagram. But he started out as a scientist. He got two-thirds of the way through a PhD in particle physics at Stanford University before ditching academia for the Silicon Valley dream. Weil is keen to highlight his pedigree: “I thought I was going to be a physics professor for the rest of my life,” he says. “I still read math books on vacation.”

Asked how OpenAI for Science fits with the firm’s existing lineup of white-collar productivity tools or the viral video app Sora, Weil recites the company mantra: “The mission of OpenAI is to try and build artificial general intelligence and, you know, make it beneficial for all of humanity.”

The impact on science of future versions of this technology could be amazing, he says: New medicines, new materials, new devices. “Think about it helping us understand the nature of reality, helping us think through open problems. Maybe the biggest, most positive impact we’re going to see from AGI will actually be from its ability to accelerate science.”

He adds, “With GPT-5, we saw that becoming possible.”

As Weil tells it, LLMs are now good enough to be useful scientific collaborators, spitballing ideas, suggesting novel directions to explore, and finding fruitful parallels between a scientist’s question and obscure research papers published decades ago or in foreign languages.

That wasn’t the case a year or so ago. Since it announced its first reasoning model, o1, in December 2024, OpenAI has been pushing the envelope of what the technology can do. “You go back a few years and we were all collectively mind-blown that the models could get an 800 on the SAT,” says Weil.

But soon LLMs were acing math competitions and solving graduate-level physics problems. Last year, OpenAI and Google DeepMind both announced that their LLMs had achieved gold-medal-level performance in the International Math Olympiad, one of the toughest math contests in the world. “These models are no longer just better than 90% of grad students,” says Weil. “They’re really at the frontier of human abilities.”

That’s a huge claim, and it comes with caveats. Still, there’s no doubt that GPT-5 is a big improvement on GPT-4 when it comes to complicated problem-solving. GPT-5 includes a so-called reasoning model, a type of LLM that can break down problems into multiple steps and work through them one by one. This technique has made LLMs far better at solving math and logic problems than they used to be.

Measured against an industry benchmark known as GPQA, which includes more than 400 multiple-choice questions that test PhD-level knowledge in biology, physics, and chemistry, GPT-4 scores 39%, well below the human-expert baseline of around 70%. According to OpenAI, GPT-5.2 (the latest update to the model, released in December) scores 92%.

The excitement is evident—and perhaps excessive. In October, senior figures at OpenAI, including Weil, boasted on X that GPT-5 had found solutions to several unsolved math problems. Mathematicians were quick to point out that in fact what GPT-5 appeared to have done was dig up existing solutions in old research papers, including at least one written in German. That was still useful, but it wasn’t the achievement OpenAI seemed to have claimed. Weil and his colleagues deleted their posts.

Now Weil is more careful. It is often enough to find answers that exist but have been forgotten, he says: “We collectively stand on the shoulders of giants, and if LLMs can kind of accumulate that knowledge so that we don’t spend time struggling on a problem that is already solved, that’s an acceleration all of its own.”

He plays down the idea that LLMs are about to come up with a game-changing new discovery. “I don’t think models are there yet,” he says. “Maybe they’ll get there. I’m optimistic that they will.”

But, he insists, that’s not the mission: “Our mission is to accelerate science. And I don’t think the bar for the acceleration of science is, like, Einstein-level reimagining of an entire field.”

For Weil, the question is this: “Does science actually happen faster because scientists plus models can do much more, and do it more quickly, than scientists alone? I think we’re already seeing that.”

In November, OpenAI published a series of anecdotal case studies contributed by scientists, both inside and outside the company, that illustrated how they had used GPT-5 and how it had helped. “Most of the cases were scientists that were already using GPT-5 directly in their research and had come to us one way or another saying, ‘Look at what I’m able to do with these tools,’” says Weil.

The key things that GPT-5 seems to be good at are finding references and connections to existing work that scientists were not aware of, which sometimes sparks new ideas; helping scientists sketch mathematical proofs; and suggesting ways for scientists to test hypotheses in the lab.

“GPT 5.2 has read substantially every paper written in the last 30 years,” says Weil. “And it understands not just the field that a particular scientist is working in; it can bring together analogies from other, unrelated fields.”

“That’s incredibly powerful,” he continues. “You can always find a human collaborator in an adjacent field, but it’s difficult to find, you know, a thousand collaborators in all thousand adjacent fields that might matter. And in addition to that, I can work with the model late at night—it doesn’t sleep—and I can ask it 10 things in parallel, which is kind of awkward to do to a human.”

Most of the scientists OpenAI reached out to back up Weil’s position.

Robert Scherrer, a professor of physics and astronomy at Vanderbilt University, only played around with ChatGPT for fun (“I used to it rewrite the theme song for Gilligan’s Island in the style of Beowulf, which it did very well,” he tells me) until his Vanderbilt colleague Alex Lupsasca, a fellow physicist who now works at OpenAI, told him that GPT-5 had helped solve a problem he’d been working on.

Lupsasca gave Scherrer access to GPT-5 Pro, OpenAI’s $200-a-month premium subscription. “It managed to solve a problem that I and my graduate student could not solve despite working on it for several months,” says Scherrer.

It’s not perfect, he says: “GTP-5 still makes dumb mistakes. Of course, I do too, but the mistakes GPT-5 makes are even dumber.” And yet it keeps getting better, he says: “If current trends continue—and that’s a big if—I suspect that all scientists will be using LLMs soon.”

Derya Unutmaz, a professor of biology at the Jackson Laboratory, a nonprofit research institute, uses GPT-5 to brainstorm ideas, summarize papers, and plan experiments in his work studying the immune system. In the case study he shared with OpenAI, Unutmaz used GPT-5 to analyze an old data set that his team had previously looked at. The model came up with fresh insights and interpretations.

“LLMs are already essential for scientists,” he says. “When you can complete analysis of data sets that used to take months, not using them is not an option anymore.”

Nikita Zhivotovskiy, a statistician at the University of California, Berkeley, says he has been using LLMs in his research since the first version of ChatGPT came out.

Like Scherrer, he finds LLMs most useful when they highlight unexpected connections between his own work and existing results he did not know about. “I believe that LLMs are becoming an essential technical tool for scientists, much like computers and the internet did before,” he says. “I expect a long-term disadvantage for those who do not use them.”

But he does not expect LLMs to make novel discoveries anytime soon. “I have seen very few genuinely fresh ideas or arguments that would be worth a publication on their own,” he says. “So far, they seem to mainly combine existing results, sometimes incorrectly, rather than produce genuinely new approaches.”

I also contacted a handful of scientists who are not connected to OpenAI.

Andy Cooper, a professor of chemistry at the University of Liverpool and director of the Leverhulme Research Centre for Functional Materials Design, is less enthusiastic. “We have not found, yet, that LLMs are fundamentally changing the way that science is done,” he says. “But our recent results suggest that they do have a place.”

Cooper is leading a project to develop a so-called AI scientist that can fully automate parts of the scientific workflow. He says that his team doesn’t use LLMs to come up with ideas. But the tech is starting to prove useful as part of a wider automated system where an LLM can help direct robots, for example.

“My guess is that LLMs might stick more in robotic workflows, at least initially, because I’m not sure that people are ready to be told what to do by an LLM,” says Cooper. “I’m certainly not.”

LLMs may be becoming more and more useful, but caution is still advised. In December, Jonathan Oppenheim, a scientist who works on quantum mechanics, called out a mistake that made its way into a scientific journal. “OpenAI leadership are promoting a paper in Physics Letters B where GPT-5 proposed the main idea—possibly the first peer-reviewed paper where an LLM generated the core contribution,” Oppenheim posted on X. “One small problem: GPT-5’s idea tests the wrong thing.”

He continued: “GPT-5 was asked for a test that detects nonlinear theories. It provided a test that detects nonlocal ones. Related-sounding, but different. It’s like asking for a COVID test, and the LLM cheerfully hands you a test for chickenpox.”

It is clear that a lot of scientists are finding innovative and intuitive ways to engage with LLMs. It is also clear that the technology makes mistakes that can be so subtle even experts miss them.

Part of the problem is the way ChatGPT can flatter you into letting down your guard. As Oppenheim put it: “A core issue is that LLMs are being trained to validate the user, while science needs tools that challenge us.” In an extreme case, one individual (who was not a scientist) was persuaded by ChatGPT into thinking for months that he’d invented a new branch of mathematics.

Of course, Weil is well aware of the problem of hallucination. But he insists that newer models are hallucinating less and less. Even so, focusing on hallucination might be missing the point, he says.

“One of my teammates here, an ex math professor, said something that stuck with me,” says Weil. “He said: ‘When I’m doing research, if I’m bouncing ideas off a colleague, I’m wrong 90% of the time and that’s kind of the point. We’re both spitballing ideas and trying to find something that works.’”

“That’s actually a desirable place to be,” says Weil. “If you say enough wrong things and then somebody stumbles on a grain of truth and then the other person seizes on it and says, ‘Oh, yeah, that’s not quite right, but what if we—’ You gradually kind of find your trail through the woods.”

This is Weil’s core vision for OpenAI for Science. GPT-5 is good, but it is not an oracle. The value of this technology is in pointing people in new directions, not coming up with definitive answers, he says.

In fact, one of the things OpenAI is now looking at is making GPT-5 dial down its confidence when it delivers a response. Instead of saying Here’s the answer, it might tell scientists: Here’s something to consider.

“That’s actually something that we are spending a bunch of time on,” says Weil. “Trying to make sure that the model has some sort of epistemological humility.”

Another thing OpenAI is looking at is how to use GPT-5 to fact-check GPT-5. It’s often the case that if you feed one of GPT-5’s answers back into the model, it will pick it apart and highlight mistakes.

“You can kind of hook the model up as its own critic,” says Weil. “Then you can get a workflow where the model is thinking and then it goes to another model, and if that model finds things that it could improve, then it passes it back to the original model and says, ‘Hey, wait a minute—this part wasn’t right, but this part was interesting. Keep it.’ It’s almost like a couple of agents working together and you only see the output once it passes the critic.”

What Weil is describing also sounds a lot like what Google DeepMind did with AlphaEvolve, a tool that wrapped the LLM Gemini inside a wider system that filtered out the good responses from the bad and fed them back in again to be improved on. Google DeepMind has used AlphaEvolve to solve several real-world problems.

OpenAI faces stiff competition from rival firms, whose own LLMs can do most, if not all, of the things it claims for its own models. If that’s the case, why should scientists use GPT-5 instead of Gemini or Anthropic’s Claude, families of models that are themselves improving every year? Ultimately, OpenAI for Science may be as much an effort to a flag in new territory as anything else. The real innovations are still to come.

“I think 2026 will be for science what 2025 was for software engineering,” says Weil. “At the beginning of 2025, if you were using AI to write most of your code, you were an early adopter. Whereas 12 months later, if you’re not using AI to write most of your code, you’re probably falling behind. We’re now seeing those same early flashes for science as we did for code.”

He continues: “I think that in a year, if you’re a scientist and you’re not heavily using AI, you’ll be missing an opportunity to increase the quality and pace of your thinking.”

How do tech companies check if their users are kids?

This question has taken on new urgency recently thanks to growing concern about the dangers that can arise when children talk to AI chatbots. For years Big Tech asked for birthdays (that one could make up) to avoid violating child privacy laws, but they weren’t required to moderate content accordingly. Two developments over the last week show how quickly things are changing in the US and how this issue is becoming a new battleground, even among parents and child-safety advocates.

In one corner is the Republican Party, which has supported laws passed in several states that require sites with adult content to verify users’ ages. Critics say this provides cover to block anything deemed “harmful to minors,” which could include sex education. Other states, like California, are coming after AI companies with laws to protect kids who talk to chatbots (by requiring them to verify who’s a kid). Meanwhile, President Trump is attempting to keep AI regulation a national issue rather than allowing states to make their own rules. Support for various bills in Congress is constantly in flux.

So what might happen? The debate is quickly moving away from whether age verification is necessary and toward who will be responsible for it. This responsibility is a hot potato that no company wants to hold.

In a blog post last Tuesday, OpenAI revealed that it plans to roll out automatic age prediction. In short, the company will apply a model that uses factors like the time of day, among others, to predict whether a person chatting is under 18. For those identified as teens or children, ChatGPT will apply filters to “reduce exposure” to content like graphic violence or sexual role-play. YouTube launched something similar last year.

If you support age verification but are concerned about privacy, this might sound like a win. But there&#39;s a catch. The system is not perfect, of course, so it could classify a child as an adult or vice versa. People who are wrongly labeled under 18 can verify their identity by submitting a selfie or government ID to a company called Persona.

Selfie verifications have issues: They fail more often for people of color and those with certain disabilities. Sameer Hinduja, who co-directs the Cyberbullying Research Center, says the fact that Persona will need to hold millions of government IDs and masses of biometric data is another weak point. “When those get breached, we’ve exposed massive populations all at once,” he says.

Hinduja instead advocates for device-level verification, where a parent specifies a child’s age when setting up the child’s phone for the first time. This information is then kept on the device and shared securely with apps and websites.

That’s more or less what Tim Cook, the CEO of Apple, recently lobbied US lawmakers to call for. Cook was fighting lawmakers who wanted to require app stores to verify ages, which would saddle Apple with lots of liability.

More signals of where this is all headed will come on Wednesday, when the Federal Trade Commission—the agency that would be responsible for enforcing these new laws—is holding an all-day workshop on age verification. Apple’s head of government affairs, Nick Rossi, will be there. He’ll be joined by higher-ups in child safety at Google and Meta, as well as a company that specializes in marketing to children.

The FTC has become increasingly politicized under President Trump (his firing of the sole Democratic commissioner was struck down by a federal court, a decision that is now pending review by the US Supreme Court). In July, I wrote about signals that the agency is softening its stance toward AI companies. Indeed, in December, the FTC overturned a Biden-era ruling against an AI company that allowed people to flood the internet with fake product reviews, writing that it clashed with President Trump’s AI Action Plan.

Wednesday’s workshop may shed light on how partisan the FTC’s approach to age verification will be. Red states favor laws that require porn websites to verify ages (but critics warn this could be used to block a much wider range of content). Bethany Soye, a Republican state representative who is leading an effort to pass such a bill in her state of South Dakota, is scheduled to speak at the FTC meeting. The ACLU generally opposes laws requiring IDs to visit websites and has instead advocated for an expansion of existing parental controls.

While all this gets debated, though, AI has set the world of child safety on fire. We’re dealing with increased generation of child sexual abuse material, concerns (and lawsuits) about suicides and self-harm following chatbot conversations, and troubling evidence of kids’ forming attachments to AI companions. Colliding stances on privacy, politics, free expression, and surveillance will complicate any effort to find a solution. Write to me with your thoughts.

            <p><strong>MIT Technology Review | 2026-01-26</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2026/01/26/1124655/the-power-of-sound-in-a-virtual-world/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">In an era where business, education, and even casual conversations occur via screens, sound has become a differentiating factor. We obsess over lighting, camera angles, and virtual backgrounds, but how we sound can be just as critical to credibility, trust, and connection.

That’s the insight driving Erik Vaveris, vice president of product management and chief marketing officer at Shure, and Brian Scholl, director of the Perception & Cognition Laboratory at Yale University. Both see audio as more than a technical layer: It’s a human factor shaping how people perceive intelligence, trustworthiness, and authority in virtual settings.

&quot;If you&#39;re willing to take a little bit of time with your audio set up, you can really get across the full power of your message and the full power of who you are to your peers, to your employees, your boss, your suppliers, and of course, your customers,&quot; says Vaveris.

Scholl’s research shows that poor audio quality can make a speaker seem less persuasive, less hireable, and even less credible.

&quot;We know that [poor] sound doesn&#39;t reflect the people themselves, but we really just can&#39;t stop ourselves from having those impressions,&quot; says Scholl. &quot;We all understand intuitively that if we&#39;re having difficulty being understood while we&#39;re talking, then that&#39;s bad. But we sort of think that as long as you can make out the words I&#39;m saying, then that&#39;s probably all fine. And this research showed in a somewhat surprising way, to a surprising degree, that this is not so.&quot;

For organizations navigating hybrid work, training, and marketing, the stakes have become high.

Vaveris points out that the pandemic was a watershed moment for audio technology. As classrooms, boardrooms, and conferences shifted online almost overnight, demand accelerated for advanced noise suppression, echo cancellation, and AI-driven processing tools that make meetings more seamless. Today, machine learning algorithms can strip away keyboard clicks or reverberation and isolate a speaker’s voice in noisy environments. That clarity underpins the accuracy of AI meeting assistants that can step in to transcribe, summarize, and analyze discussions.

The implications across industries are rippling. Clearer audio levels the playing field for remote participants, enabling inclusive collaboration. It empowers executives and creators alike to produce broadcast-quality content from the comfort of their home office. And it offers companies new ways to build credibility with customers and employees without the costly overhead of traditional production.

Looking forward, the convergence of audio innovation and AI promises an even more dynamic landscape: from real-time captioning in your native language to audio filtering, to smarter meeting tools that capture not only what is said but how it’s said, and to technologies that disappear into the background while amplifying the human voice at the center.

&quot;There&#39;s a future out there where this technology can really be something that helps bring people together,&quot; says Vaveris. &quot;Now that we have so many years of history with the internet, we know there&#39;s usually two sides to the coin of technology, but there&#39;s definitely going to be a positive side to this, and I&#39;m really looking forward to it.

In a world increasingly mediated by screens, sound may prove to be the most powerful connector of all.

This episode of Business Lab is produced in partnership with Shure.

Megan Tatum: From MIT Technology Review, I&#39;m Megan Tatum, and this is Business Lab, the show that helps business leaders make sense of new technologies coming out of the lab and into the marketplace.This episode is produced in partnership with Shure.Our topic today is the power of sound. As our personal and professional lives become increasingly virtual, audio is emerging as an essential tool for everything from remote work to virtual conferences to virtual happy hour. While appearance is often top of mind in video conferencing and streaming, audio can be as or even more important, not only to effective communication, but potentially to brand equity for both the speaker and the company.Two words for you: crystal clear.My guests today are Erik Vaveris, VP of Product Management and Chief Marketing Officer at Shure, and Brian Scholl, Director of the Perception & Cognition Laboratory at Yale University.Welcome, Erik and Brian.

Erik Vaveris: Thank you, Megan. And hello, Brian. Thrilled to be here today.

Megan: Fantastic. Thank you both so much for being here. Erik, let&#39;s open with a bit of background. I imagine the pandemic changed the audio industry in some significant ways, given the pivot to our modern remote hybrid lifestyles. Could you talk a bit about that journey and some of the interesting audio advances that arose from that transformative shift?

Erik: Absolutely, Megan. That&#39;s an interesting thing to think about now being here in 2025. And if you put yourself back in those moments in 2020, when things were fully shut down and everything was fully remote, the importance of audio quality became immediately obvious. As people adopted Zoom or Teams or platforms like that overnight, there were a lot of technical challenges that people experienced, but the importance of how they were presenting themselves to people via their audio quality was a bit less obvious. As Brian&#39;s noted in a lot of the press that he&#39;s received for his wonderful study, we know how we look on video. We can see ourselves back on the screen, but we don&#39;t know how we sound to the people with whom we&#39;re speaking.

If a meeting participant on the other side can manage to parse the words that you&#39;re saying, they&#39;re not likely to speak up and say, &quot;Hey, I&#39;m having a little bit of trouble hearing you.&quot; They&#39;ll just let the meeting continue. And if you don&#39;t have a really strong level of audio quality, you&#39;re asking the people that you&#39;re talking to devote way too much brainpower to just determining the words that you&#39;re saying. And you&#39;re going to be fatiguing to listen to. And your message won&#39;t come across. In contrast, if you&#39;re willing to take a little bit of time with your audio set up, you can really get across the full power of your message and the full power of who you are to your peers, to your employees, your boss, your suppliers, and of course your customers. Back in 2020, this very quickly became a marketing story that we had to tell immediately.

And I have to say, it&#39;s so gratifying to see Brian&#39;s research in the news because, to me, it was like, &quot;Yes, this is what we&#39;ve been experiencing. And this is what we&#39;ve been trying to educate people about.&quot; Having the real science to back it up means a lot. But from that, development on improvements to key audio processing algorithms accelerated across the whole AV industry.

I think, Megan and Brian, you probably remember hearing loud keyboard clicking when you were on calls and meetings, or people eating potato chips and things like that back on those. But you don&#39;t hear that much today because most platforms have invested in AI-trained algorithms to remove undesirable noises. And I know we&#39;re going to talk more about that later on.

But the other thing that happened, thankfully, was that as we got into the late spring and summer of 2020, was that educational institutions, especially universities, and also businesses realized that things were going to need to change quickly. Nothing was going to be the same. And universities realized that all classrooms were going to need hybrid capabilities for both remote students and students in the classroom. And that helped the market for professional AV equipment start to recover because we had been pretty much completely shut down in the earlier months. But that focus on hybrid meeting spaces of all types accelerated more investment and more R&D into making equipment and further developing those key audio processing algorithms for more and different types of spaces and use cases. And since then, we&#39;ve really seen a proliferation of different types of unobtrusive audio capture devices based on arrays of microphones and the supporting signal processing behind them. And right now, machine-learning-trained signal processing is really the norm. And that all accelerated, unfortunately, because of the pandemic.

Megan: Yeah. Such an interesting period of change, as you say. And Brian, what did you observe and experience in academia during that time? How did that time period affect the work at your lab?

Brian: I&#39;ll admit, Megan, I had never given a single thought to audio quality or anything like that, certainly until the pandemic hit. I was thrown into this, just like the rest of the world was. I don&#39;t believe I&#39;d ever had a single video conference with a student or with a class or anything like that before the pandemic hit. But in some ways, our experience in universities was quite extreme. I went on a Tuesday from teaching an in-person class with 300 students to being on Zoom with everyone suddenly on a Thursday. Business meetings come in all shapes and sizes. But this was quite extreme. This was a case where suddenly I&#39;m talking to hundreds and hundreds of people over Zoom. And every single one of them knows exactly what I sound like, except for me, because I&#39;m just speaking my normal voice and I have no idea how it&#39;s being translated through all the different levels of technology.

I will say, part of the general rhetoric we have about the pandemic focuses on all the negatives and the lack of personal connection and nuance and the fact that we can&#39;t see how everyone&#39;s paying attention to each other. Our experience was a bit more mixed. I&#39;ll just tell you one anecdote. Shortly after the pandemic started, I started teaching a seminar with about 20 students. And of course, this was still online. What I did is I just invited, for whatever topic we were discussing on any given day, I sent a note to whoever was the clear world leader in the study of whatever that topic was. I said, &quot;Hey, don&#39;t prepare a talk. You don&#39;t have to answer any questions. But just come join us on Zoom and just participate in the conversation. The students will have read some of your work.&quot;

Every single one of them said, &quot;Let me check my schedule. Oh, I&#39;m stuck at home for a year. Sure. I&#39;d be happy to do that.&quot; And that was quite a positive. The students got to meet a who&#39;s who of cognitive science from this experience. And it&#39;s true that there were all these technological difficulties, but that would never, ever have happened if we were teaching the class in real life. That would&#39;ve just been way too much travel and airfare and hotel and scheduling and all of that. So, it was a mixed bag for us.

Erik: That is really interesting. And that&#39;s such a cool idea. And it&#39;s so wonderful that that worked out. I would say that working for a global company, we like to think that, &quot;Oh, we&#39;re all together. And we&#39;re having these meetings. And we&#39;re in the same room,&quot; but the reality was we weren&#39;t in the same room. And there hadn&#39;t been enough attention paid to the people who were conferencing in speaking not their native language in a different time zone, maybe pretty deep into the evening, in some cases. And the remote work that everybody got thrown into immediately at the start of the pandemic did force everybody to start to think more about those types of interactions and put everybody on a level playing field.

And that was insightful. And that helped some people have stronger voices in the work that we were doing than they maybe did before. And it&#39;s also led businesses really across the board, there&#39;s a lot written about this, to be much more focused on making sure that participants from those who may be remote at home, may be in the office, may be in different offices, may be in different time zones, are all able to participate and collaborate on really a level playing field. And that is a positive. That&#39;s a good thing.

Megan: Yeah. There are absolutely some positive side effects there, aren&#39;t there? And it inspired you, Brian, to look at this more closely. And you&#39;ve done a study that shows poor audio quality can actually affect the perception of listeners. So, I wonder what prompted the study, in particular. And what kinds of data did you gather? What methodology did you use?

Brian: Yeah. The motivation for this study was actually a real-world experience, just like we&#39;ve been talking about. In addition to all of our classes moving online with no notice whatsoever, the same thing was true of our departmental faculty meetings. Very early on in the pandemic, we had one of these meetings. And we were talking about some contentious issue about hiring or whatever. And two of my colleagues, who I&#39;d known very well and for many, many years, spoke up to offer their opinions. And one of these colleagues is someone who I&#39;m very close with. We almost always see eye to eye. He was actually a former graduate student of mine once upon a time. And we almost always see eye to eye on things. He happened to be participating in that meeting from an old not-so-hot laptop. His audio quality had that sort of familiar tinny quality that we&#39;re all familiar with. I could totally understand everything he was saying, but I found myself just being a little skeptical.

I didn&#39;t find his points so compelling as usual. Meanwhile, I had another colleague, someone who I deeply respect, I&#39;ve collaborated with, but we don&#39;t always see eye to eye on these things. And he was participating in this first virtual faculty meeting from his home recording studio. Erik, I don&#39;t know if his equipment would be up to your level or not, but he sounded better than real life. He sounded like he was all around us. And I found myself just sort of naturally agreeing with his points, which sort of was notable and a little surprising in that context. And so, we turned this into a study.

We played people a number of short audio clips, maybe like 30 seconds or so. And we had these being played in the context of very familiar situations and decisions. One of them might be like a hiring decision. You would have to listen to this person telling you why they think they might be a good fit for your job. And then afterwards, you had to make a simple judgment. It might be of a trait. How intelligent did that person seem? Or it might be a real-world decision like, &quot;Hey, based on this, how likely would you be to pursue trying to hire them?&quot; And critically, we had people listen to exactly the same sort of scripts, but with a little bit of work behind the scenes to affect the audio quality. In one case, the audio sounded crisp and clear. Recorded with a decent microphone. And here&#39;s what it sounded like.

Audio Clip: After eight years in sales, I&#39;m currently seeking a new challenge which will utilize my meticulous attention to detail and friendly professional manner. I&#39;m an excellent fit for your company and will be an asset to your team as a senior sales manager.

Brian: Okay. Whatever you think of the content of that message, at least it&#39;s nice and clear. Other subjects listened to exactly the same recording. But again, it had that sort of tinny quality that we&#39;re all familiar with when people&#39;s voices are filtered through a microphone or a recording setup that&#39;s not so hot. That sounded like this.

Audio Clip: After eight years in sales, I&#39;m currently seeking a new challenge which will utilize my meticulous attention to detail and friendly professional manner. I&#39;m an excellent fit for your company and will be an asset to your team as a senior sales manager.

Brian: All right. Now, the thing that I hope you can get from that recording there is that although it clearly has this what we would call, as a technical term, a disfluent sound, it&#39;s just a little harder to process, you are ultimately successful, right? Megan, Erik, you were able to understand the words in that second recording.

Brian: And we made sure this was true for all of our subjects. We had them do word-for-word transcription after they made these judgments. And I&#39;ll also just point out that this kind of manipulation clearly can&#39;t be about the person themselves, right? You couldn&#39;t make your voices sound like that in real world conversation if you tried. Voices just don&#39;t do those sorts of things. Nevertheless, in a way that sort of didn&#39;t make sense, that was kind of irrational because this couldn&#39;t reflect the person, this affected all sorts of judgments about people.

So, people were judged to be about 8% less hirable. They were judged to be about 8% less intelligent. We also did this in other contexts. We did this in the context of dateability as if you were listening to a little audio clip from someone who was maybe interested in dating you, and then you had to make a judgment of how likely would you be to date this person. Same exact result. People were a little less datable when their audio was a little more tinny, even though they were completely understandable.

The experiment, the result that I thought was in some ways most striking is one of the clips was about someone who had been in a car accident. It was a little narrative about what had happened in the car accident. And they were talking as if to the insurance agent. They were saying, &quot;Hey, it wasn&#39;t my fault. This is what happened.&quot; And afterwards, we simply had people make a natural intuitive judgment of how credible do you think the person&#39;s story was. And when it was recorded with high-end audio, these messages were judged to be about 8% more credible in this context. So those are our experiments. What it shows really is something about the power of perception. We know that that sort of sound doesn&#39;t reflect the people themselves, but we really just can&#39;t stop ourselves from having those impressions made. And I don&#39;t know about you guys, but, Erik, I think you&#39;re right, that we all understand intuitively that if we&#39;re having difficulty being understood while we&#39;re talking, then that&#39;s bad. But we sort of think that as long as you can make out the words I&#39;m saying, then that&#39;s probably all fine. And this research showed in a somewhat surprising way to a surprising degree that this is not so.

Megan: From an industry perspective, Erik, what are your thoughts on those study results? Did it surprise you as well?

Erik: No, like I said, I found it very, very gratifying because we invest a lot in trying to make sure that people understand the importance of quality audio, but we kind of come about that intuitively. Our entire company is audio people. So of course, we think that. And it&#39;s our mission to help other people achieve those higher levels of audio in everything that they do, whether you&#39;re a minister at a church or you&#39;re teaching a class or you&#39;re performing on stage. When I first saw in the news about Brian&#39;s study, I think it was the NPR article that just came up in one of my feeds. I read it and it made me feel like my life&#39;s work has been validated to some extent. I wouldn&#39;t say we were surprised by it, but iIt made a lot of sense to us. Let&#39;s put it that way.

Brian: This is what we&#39;re hearing. Oh, sorry. Megan, I was going to say this is what we&#39;re hearing from a lot of the audio professionals as they&#39;re saying, &quot;Hey, you scientists, you finally caught up to us.&quot; But of course-

Brian: Erik, you&#39;re in an unusual circumstance because you guys think about audio every day. When we&#39;re on Zoom, look, I can see the little rectangle as well as you can. I can see exactly how I look like. I can check the lighting. I check my hair. We all do that every day. But I would say most people really, they use whatever microphone came with their setup, and never give a second thought to what they sound like because they don&#39;t know what they sound like.

Megan: Avoid listening to yourself back as well. I think that&#39;s common. We don&#39;t scrutinize audio as much as we should. I wonder, Erik, since the study came out, how are you seeing that research play out across industry? Can you talk a bit about the importance of strong, clear audio in today&#39;s virtual world and the challenges that companies and employees are facing as well?

Erik: Yeah. Sure, Megan. That&#39;s a great question. And studies kind of back this up, businesses understand that collaboration is the key to many things that we do. They know that that&#39;s critical. And they are investing in making the experiences for the people at work better because of that knowledge, that intuitive understanding. But there are challenges. It can be expensive. You need solutions that people who are going to walk into a room or join a meeting on their personal device, that they&#39;re motivated to use and that they can use because they&#39;re simple. You also have to overcome the barriers to investment. We in the AV industry have had to look a lot at how can we bring down the overall cost of ownership of setting up AV technology because, as we&#39;ve seen, the prices of everything that goes into making a product are not coming down.

Simplifying deployment and management is critical. Beyond just audio technology, IoT technology and cloud technology for IT teams to be able to easily deploy and manage classrooms across an entire university campus or conference rooms across a global enterprise are really, really critical. And those are quickly evolving. And integrations with more standard common IT tools are coming out. And that&#39;s one area. Another thing is just for the end user, having the same user interface in each conference room that is familiar to everyone from their personal devices is also important. For many, many years, a lot of people had the experience where, &quot;Hey, it&#39;s time we&#39;re going to actually do a conference meeting.&quot; And you might have a few rooms in your company or in your office area that could do that. And you walk into the meeting room. And how long does it take you to actually get connected to the people you&#39;re going to talk with?

There was always a joke that you&#39;d have to spend the first 15 minutes of a meeting working all of that out. And that&#39;s because the technology was fragmented and you had to do a lot of custom work to make that happen. But these days, I would say platforms like Zoom and Teams and Google and others are doing a really great job with this. If you have the latest and greatest in your meeting rooms and you know how to join from your own personal device, it&#39;s basically the same experience. And that is streamlining the process for everyone. Bringing down the costs of owning it so that companies can get to those benefits to collaboration is kind of the key.

Megan: I was going to ask if we could dive a little deeper into that kind of audio quality, the technological advancements that AI has made possible, which you did touch on slightly there, Erik. What are the most significant advancements, in your view? And how are those impacting the ways we use audio and the things we can do with it?

Erik: Okay. Let me try to break that down into-

Erik: ... a couple different sections. Yeah. No, and one that&#39;s just so exciting. Machine-learning-based digital signal processing, or DSP, is here and is the norm now. If you think about the beginning of telephones and teleconferencing, just going way back, one of the initial problems you had whenever you tried to get something out of a dedicated handset onto a table was echo. And I&#39;m sure we&#39;ve all heard that at some point in our life. You need to have a way to cancel echo. But by the way, you also want people to be able to speak at the same time on both ends of a call. You get to some of those very rudimentary things. Machine learning is really supercharging those algorithms to provide better performance with fewer trade-offs, fewer artifacts in the actual audio signal.

Noise reduction has come a long way. I mentioned earlier on, keyboard sounds and the sounds of people eating, and how you just don&#39;t hear that anymore, at least I don&#39;t when I&#39;m on conference calls. But only a few years ago, that could be a major problem. The machine-learning-trained digital signal processing is in the market now and it&#39;s doing a better job than ever in removing things that you don&#39;t want from your sound. We have a new de-verberation algorithm, so if you have a reverberant room with echoes and reflections that&#39;s getting into the audio signal, that can degrade the experience there. We can remove that now. Another thing, the flip side of that is that there&#39;s also a focus on isolating the sound that you do want and the signal that you do want.

Microsoft has rolled out a voice print feature in Teams that allows you, if you&#39;re willing, to provide them with a sample of your voice. And then whenever you&#39;re talking from your device, it will take out anything else that the microphone may be picking up so that even if you&#39;re in a really noisy environment outdoors or, say, in an airport, the people that you&#39;re speaking with are going to hear you and only you. And it&#39;s pretty amazing as well. So those are some of the things that are happening today and are available today.

Another thing that&#39;s emerged from all of this is we&#39;ve been talking about how important audio quality is to the people participating in a discussion, the people speaking, the people listening, how everyone is perceived, but a new consumer, if you will, of audio in a discussion or a meeting has emerged, and that is in the form of the AI agent that can summarize meetings and create action plans, do those sorts of things. But for it to work, a clean transcription of what was said is already table stakes. It can&#39;t garbled. It can&#39;t miss key things. It needs to get it word for word, sentence for sentence throughout the entire meeting. And the ability to attribute who said what to the meeting participants, even if they&#39;re all in the same room, is quickly upon us. And the ability to detect and integrate sentiment and emotion of the participants is going to become very important as well for us to really get the full value out of those kinds of AI agents.

So audio quality is as important as ever for humans, as Brian notes, in some ways more important because this is now the normal way that we talk and meet, but it&#39;s also critical for AI agents to work properly. And it&#39;s different, right? It&#39;s a different set of considerations. And there&#39;s a lot of emerging thought and work that&#39;s going into that as well. And boy, Megan, there&#39;s so much more we could say about this beyond meetings and video conferences. AI tools to simplify the production process. And of course, there&#39;s generative AI of music content. I know that&#39;s beyond the scope of what we&#39;re talking about. But it&#39;s really pretty incredible when you look around at the work that&#39;s happening and the capabilities that are emerging.

Megan: Yeah. Absolutely. Sounds like there are so many elements to consider and work going on. It&#39;s all fascinating. Brian, what kinds of emerging capabilities and use cases around AI and audio quality are you seeing in your lab as well?

Brian: Yeah. Well, I&#39;m sorry that Brian himself was not able to be here today, but I&#39;m an AI agent.

Brian: Just kidding. The fascinating thing that we&#39;re seeing from the lab, from the study of people&#39;s impressions is that all of this technology that Erik has described, when it works best, it&#39;s completely invisible. Erik, I loved your point about not hearing potato chips being eaten or rain in the background or something like that. You&#39;re totally right. I used to notice that all the time. I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve noticed that recently, but I also didn&#39;t notice that I haven&#39;t noticed that recently, right? It just kind of disappears. The interesting thing about these perceptual impressions, we&#39;re constantly drawing intuitive conclusions about people based on how they sound. And that might be a good thing or a bad thing when we&#39;re judging things like trustworthiness, for example, on the basis of a short audio clip.

But clearly, some of these things are valid, right? We can judge the size of someone or even of an animal based on how they sound, right? A chihuahua can&#39;t make the sound of a lion. A lion can&#39;t make the sound of a chihuahua. And that&#39;s always been true because we&#39;re producing audio signals that go right into each other&#39;s ears. And now, of course, everything that Erik is talking about, that&#39;s not true. It goes through all of these different layers of technology increasingly fueled by AI. But when that technology works the best way, it&#39;s as if it isn&#39;t there at all and we&#39;re just hearing each other directly.

Erik: That&#39;s the goal, right? That it&#39;s seamless open communication and we don&#39;t have to think about the technology anymore.

Brian: It&#39;s a tough business to be in, I think, though, Erik, because people have to know what&#39;s going on behind the surface in order to value it. Otherwise, we just expect it to work.

Erik: Well, that&#39;s why we try to put the logo of our products on the side of them so they show up in the videos. But yeah, it&#39;s a good point.

Megan: And we&#39;ve talked about virtual meetings and conversations quite a bit, but there&#39;s also streamed and recorded content, which are increasingly important at work as well. I wondered, Erik, if you could talk a bit about how businesses are leveraging audio in new ways for things like marketing campaigns and internal upskilling and training and areas like that?

Erik: Yeah. Well, one of the things I think we&#39;ve all seen in marketing is that not everything is a high production value commercial anymore. And there&#39;s still a place for that, for sure. But people tend to trust influencers that they follow. People search on TikTok, on YouTube for topics. Those can be the place that they start. And as technology&#39;s gotten more accessible, not just audio, but of course, the video technology too, content creators can produce satisfying content on their own or with just a couple of people with them. And Brian&#39;s study shows that it doesn&#39;t really matter what the origins of the content are for it to be compelling.

For the person delivering the message to be compelling, the audio quality does have to hit a certain level. But because the tools are simpler to use and you need less things to connect and pull together a decent production system, creator-driven content is becoming even more and more integral to a marketing campaign. And so not just what they maybe post on their Instagram page or post on LinkedIn, for example, but us as a brand being able to take that content and use that actually in paid media and things like that is all entirely possible because of the overall quality of the content. So that&#39;s something that&#39;s been a trend that&#39;s been in process really, I would say, maybe since the advent of podcasts. But it&#39;s been an evolution. And it&#39;s come a long, long way.

Another thing, and this is really interesting, and this hits home personally, but I remember when I first entered the workforce, and I hope I&#39;m not showing my age too badly here, but I remember the word processing department. And you would write down on a piece of paper, like a memo, and you would give it to the word processing department and somebody would type it up for you. That was a thing. And these days, we&#39;re seeing actually more and more video production with audio, of course, transfer to the actual producers of the content.

In my company, at Shure, we make videos for different purposes to talk about different initiatives or product launches or things that we&#39;re doing just for internal use. And right now, everybody, including our CEO, she makes these videos just at her own desk. She has a little software tool and she can show a PowerPoint and herself and speak to things. And with very, very limited amount of editing, you can put that out there. And I&#39;ve seen friends and colleagues at other companies in very high-level roles just kind of doing their own production. Being able to buy a very high quality microphone with really advanced signal processing built right in, but just plug it in via USB and have it be handled as simply as any consumer device, has made it possible to do really very useful production where you are going to actually sound good and get your message across, but without having to make such a big production out of it, which is kind of cool.

Megan: Yeah. Really democratizes access to sort of creating high quality content, doesn&#39;t it? And of course, no technology discussion is complete without a mention of return on investment, particularly nowadays. Erik, what are some ways companies can get returns on their audio tech investments as well? Where are the most common places you see cost savings?

Erik: Yeah. Well, we collaborated on a study with IDC Research. And they came up with some really interesting findings on this. And one of them was, no surprise, two-thirds or more of companies have taken action on improving their communication and collaboration technology, and even more have additional or initial investments still planned. But the ROI of those initiatives isn&#39;t really tied to the initiative itself. It&#39;s not like when you come out with a new product, you look at how that product performs, and that&#39;s the driver of your ROI. The benefits of smoother collaboration come in the form of shorter meetings, more productive meetings, better decision-making, faster decision-making, stronger teamwork. And so to build an ROI model, what IDC concluded was that you have to build your model to account for those advantages really across the enterprise or across your university, or whatever it may be, and kind of up and down the different set of activities where they&#39;re actually going to be utilized.

So that can be complex. Quantifying things can always be a challenge. But like I said, companies do seem to understand this. And I think that&#39;s because, this is just my hunch, but because everybody, including the CEO and the CFO and the whole finance department, uses and benefits from collaboration technology too. Perhaps that&#39;s one reason why the value is easier to convey. Even if they have not taken the time to articulate things like we&#39;re doing here today, they know when a meeting is good and when it&#39;s not good. And maybe that&#39;s one of the things that&#39;s helping companies to justify these investments. But it&#39;s always tricky to do ROI on projects like that. But again, focusing on the broader benefits of collaboration and breaking it down into what it means for specific activities and types of meetings, I think, is the way to go about doing that.

Megan: Absolutely. And Brian, what kinds of advancements are you seeing in the lab that perhaps one day might contribute to those cost savings?

Brian: Well, I don&#39;t know anything about cost savings, Megan. I&#39;m a college professor. I live a pure life of the mind.

Brian: ROI does not compute for me. No, I would say we are in an extremely exciting frontier right now because of AI and many different technologies. The studies that we talked about earlier, in one sense, they were broad. We explored many different traits from dating to hiring to credibility. And we isolated them in all sorts of ways we didn&#39;t talk about. We showed that it wasn&#39;t due to overall affect or pessimism or something like that. But in those studies, we really only tested one very particular set of dimensions along which an audio signal can vary, which is some sort of model of clarity. But in reality, the audio signal is so multi-dimensional. And as we&#39;re getting more and more tools these days, we can not only change audio along the lines of clarity, as we&#39;ve been talking about, but we can potentially manipulate it in all sorts of ways.

We&#39;re very interested in pushing these studies forward and in exploring how people&#39;s sort of brute impressions that they make are affected by all sorts of things. Meg and Erik, we walk around the world all the time making these judgments about people, right? You meet someone and you&#39;re like, &quot;Wow, I could really be friends with them. They seem like a great person.&quot; And you know that you&#39;re making that judgment, but you have no idea why, right? It just seems kind of intuitive. Well, in an audio signal, when you&#39;re talking to someone, you can think of, &quot;What if their signal is more bass heavy? What if it&#39;s a little more treble heavy? What if we manipulate it in this way? In that way?&quot;

When we talked about the faculty meeting that motivated this whole research program, I mentioned that my colleague, who was speaking from his home recording studio, he actually didn&#39;t sound clear like in real life. He sounded better than in real life. He sounded like he was all around us. What is the implication of that? I think there&#39;s so many different dimensions of an audio signal that we&#39;re just being able to readily control and manipulate that it&#39;s going to be very exciting to see how all of these sorts of things impact our impressions of each other.

Megan: And there may be some overlap with this as well, but I wondered if we could close with a future forward look, Brian. What are you looking forward to in emerging audio technology? What are some exciting opportunities on the horizon, perhaps related to what you were just talking about there?

Brian: Well, we&#39;re interested in studying this from a scientific perspective. Erik, you talked about how when you started. When I started doing this science, we didn&#39;t have a word processing department. We had a stone tablet department. But I hear tell that the current generation, when they send photos back and forth to each other, that they, as a matter, of course, they apply all sorts of filters-

Brian: ... to those video signals, those video or just photographic signals. We&#39;re all familiar with that. That hasn&#39;t quite happened with the audio signals yet, but I think that&#39;s coming up as well. You can imagine that you record yourself saying a little message and then you filter it this way or that way. And that&#39;s going to become the Wild West about the kinds of impressions we make on each other, especially if and when you don&#39;t know that those filters have been operating in the first place.

Megan: That&#39;s so interesting. Erik, what are you looking forward to in audio technology as well?

Erik: Well, I&#39;m still thinking about what Brian said.

Erik: I have to go back again. I&#39;ll go back to the past, maybe 15 to 20 years. And I remember at work, we had meeting rooms with the Starfish phones in the middle of the table. And I remember that we would have international meetings with our partners there that were selling our products in different countries, including in Japan and in China, and the people actually in our own company in those countries. We knew the time zone was bad. And we knew that English wasn&#39;t their native language, and tried to be as courteous as possible with written materials and things like that. But I went over to China, and I had to actually be on the other end of one of those calls. And I&#39;m a native English speaker, or at least a native Chicago dialect of American English speaker. And really understanding how challenging it was for them to participate in those meetings just hit me right between the eyes.

We&#39;ve come so far, which is wonderful. But I think of a scenario, and this is not far off, there are many companies working on this right now, where not only can you get a real time captioning in your native language, no matter what the language of the participant, you can actually hear the person who&#39;s speaking&#39;s voice manipulated into your native language.

I&#39;m never going to be a fluent Japanese or Chinese speaker, that&#39;s for sure. But I love the thought that I could actually talk with people and they could understand me as though I were speaking their native language, and that they could communicate to me and I could understand them in the way that they want to be understood. I think there&#39;s a future out there where this technology can really be something that helps bring people together. Now that we have so many years of history with the internet, we know there&#39;s usually two sides to the coin of technology, but there&#39;s definitely going to be a positive side to this, and I&#39;m really looking forward to it.

Meet the new biologists treating LLMs like aliens

How large is a large language model? We now coexist with machines so vast and so complicated that nobody quite understands what they are, how they work, or what they can really do—not even the people who build them.That’s a problem. Even though nobody fully understands how it works—and thus exactly what its limitations might be—hundreds of millions of people now use this technology every day.

To help overcome our ignorance, researchers are studying LLMs as if they were doing biology or neuroscience on vast living creatures—city-size xenomorphs that have appeared in our midst. And they’re discovering that large language models are even weirder than they thought. Read the full story.—Will Douglas Heaven

Job titles of the future: Head-transplant surgeon

The Italian neurosurgeon Sergio Canavero has been preparing for a surgery that might never happen. His idea? Swap a sick person’s head—or perhaps just the brain—onto a younger, healthier body.Canavero caused a stir in 2017 when he announced that a team he advised in China had exchanged heads between two corpses. But he never convinced skeptics that his technique could succeed—or to believe his claim that a procedure on a live person was imminent.

Canavero may have withdrawn from the spotlight, but the idea of head transplants isn’t going away. Instead, he says, the concept has recently been getting a fresh look from life-extension enthusiasts and stealth Silicon Valley startups. Read the full story.

In science fiction, they were envisioned as a fundamental part of the future—even in dystopias like George Orwell’s 1984, where they help to deliver orders for the main character, Winston Smith, in his job rewriting history to fit the ruling party’s changing narrative.In real life, the tubes were expected to transform several industries in the late 19th century through the mid-20th. For a while, the United States took up the systems with gusto.But by the mid to late 20th century, use of the technology had largely fallen by the wayside, and pneumatic tube technology became virtually obsolete. Except in hospitals. Read the full story.

For the past two decades, there’s been a clear first step for anyone who starts experiencing new medical symptoms: Look them up online. The practice was so common that it gained the pejorative moniker “Dr. Google.” But times are changing, and many medical-information seekers are now using LLMs. According to OpenAI, 230 million people ask ChatGPT health-related queries each week.

That’s the context around the launch of OpenAI’s new ChatGPT Health product, which debuted earlier this month. The big question is: can the obvious risks of using AI for health-related queries be mitigated enough for them to be a net benefit? Read the full story.

In the final weeks of 2025, the battle over regulating artificial intelligence in the US reached boiling point. On December 11, after Congress failed twice to pass a law banning state AI laws, President Donald Trump signed a sweeping executive order seeking to handcuff states from regulating the booming industry.

Instead, he vowed to work with Congress to establish a “minimally burdensome” national AI policy. The move marked a victory for tech titans, who have been marshaling multimillion-dollar war chests to oppose AI regulations, arguing that a patchwork of state laws would stifle innovation.

In 2026, the battleground will shift to the courts. While some states might back down from passing AI laws, others will charge ahead. Read our story about what’s on the horizon.

This week marked a rather unpleasant anniversary: It’s a year since Texas reported a case of measles—the start of a significant outbreak that ended up spreading across multiple states. Since the start of January 2025, there have been over 2,500 confirmed cases of measles in the US. Three people have died.

As vaccination rates drop and outbreaks continue, scientists have been experimenting with new ways to quickly identify new cases and prevent the disease from spreading. And they are starting to see some success with wastewater surveillance. Read the full story.

After falling steadily for decades, the prevalence of global hunger is now on the rise—nowhere more so than in sub-Saharan Africa.

Africa’s indigenous crops are often more nutritious and better suited to the hot and dry conditions that are becoming more prevalent, yet many have been neglected by science, which means they tend to be more vulnerable to diseases and pests and yield well below their theoretical potential.

Now the question is whether researchers, governments, and farmers can work together in a way that gets these crops onto plates and provides Africans from all walks of life with the energy and nutrition that they need to thrive, whatever climate change throws their way. Read the full story.

In the final weeks of 2025, the battle over regulating artificial intelligence in the US reached a boiling point. On December 11, after Congress failed twice to pass a law banning state AI laws, President Donald Trump signed a sweeping executive order seeking to handcuff states from regulating the booming industry. Instead, he vowed to work with Congress to establish a “minimally burdensome” national AI policy, one that would position the US to win the global AI race. The move marked a qualified victory for tech titans, who have been marshaling multimillion-dollar war chests to oppose AI regulations, arguing that a patchwork of state laws would stifle innovation.

In 2026, the battleground will shift to the courts. While some states might back down from passing AI laws, others will charge ahead, buoyed by mounting public pressure to protect children from chatbots and rein in power-hungry data centers. Meanwhile, dueling super PACs bankrolled by tech moguls and AI-safety advocates will pour tens of millions into congressional and state elections to seat lawmakers who champion their competing visions for AI regulation.

Trump’s executive order directs the Department of Justice to establish a task force that sues states whose AI laws clash with his vision for light-touch regulation. It also directs the Department of Commerce to starve states of federal broadband funding if their AI laws are “onerous.” In practice, the order may target a handful of laws in Democratic states, says James Grimmelmann, a law professor at Cornell Law School. “The executive order will be used to challenge a smaller number of provisions, mostly relating to transparency and bias in AI, which tend to be more liberal issues,” Grimmelmann says.

For now, many states aren’t flinching. On December 19, New York’s governor, Kathy Hochul, signed the Responsible AI Safety and Education (RAISE) Act, a landmark law requiring AI companies to publish the protocols used to ensure the safe development of their AI models and report critical safety incidents. On January 1, California debuted the nation’s first frontier AI safety law, SB 53—which the RAISE Act was modeled on—aimed at preventing catastrophic harms such as biological weapons or cyberattacks. While both laws were watered down from earlier iterations to survive bruising industry lobbying, they struck a rare, if fragile, compromise between tech giants and AI safety advocates.

If Trump targets these hard-won laws, Democratic states like California and New York will likely take the fight to court. Republican states like Florida with vocal champions for AI regulation might follow suit. Trump could face an uphill battle. “The Trump administration is stretching itself thin with some of its attempts to effectively preempt [legislation] via executive action,” says Margot Kaminski, a law professor at the University of Colorado Law School. “It’s on thin ice.”

But Republican states that are anxious to stay off Trump’s radar or can’t afford to lose federal broadband funding for their sprawling rural communities might retreat from passing or enforcing AI laws. Win or lose in court, the chaos and uncertainty could chill state lawmaking. Paradoxically, the Democratic states that Trump wants to rein in—armed with big budgets and emboldened by the optics of battling the administration—may be the least likely to budge.

In lieu of state laws, Trump promises to create a federal AI policy with Congress. But the gridlocked and polarized body won’t be delivering a bill this year. In July, the Senate killed a moratorium on state AI laws that had been inserted into a tax bill, and in November, the House scrapped an encore attempt in a defense bill. In fact, Trump’s bid to strong-arm Congress with an executive order may sour any appetite for a bipartisan deal.

The executive order “has made it harder to pass responsible AI policy by hardening a lot of positions, making it a much more partisan issue,” says Brad Carson, a former Democratic congressman from Oklahoma who is building a network of super PACs backing candidates who support AI regulation. “It hardened Democrats and created incredible fault lines among Republicans,” he says.

While AI accelerationists in Trump’s orbit—AI and crypto czar David Sacks among them—champion deregulation, populist MAGA firebrands like Steve Bannon warn of rogue superintelligence and mass unemployment. In response to Trump’s executive order, Republican state attorneys general signed a bipartisan letter urging the FCC not to supersede state AI laws.

With Americans increasingly anxious about how AI could harm mental health, jobs, and the environment, public demand for regulation is growing. If Congress stays paralyzed, states will be the only ones acting to keep the AI industry in check. In 2025, state legislators introduced more than 1,000 AI bills, and nearly 40 states enacted over 100 laws, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.

Efforts to protect children from chatbots may inspire rare consensus. On January 7, Google and Character Technologies, a startup behind the companion chatbot Character.AI, settled several lawsuits with families of teenagers who killed themselves after interacting with the bot. Just a day later, the Kentucky attorney general sued Character Technologies, alleging that the chatbots drove children to suicide and other forms of self-harm. OpenAI and Meta face a barrage of similar suits. Expect more to pile up this year. Without AI laws on the books, it remains to be seen how product liability laws and free speech doctrines apply to these novel dangers. “It’s an open question what the courts will do,” says Grimmelmann.

While litigation brews, states will move to pass child safety laws, which are exempt from Trump’s proposed ban on state AI laws. On January 9, OpenAI inked a deal with a former foe, the child-safety advocacy group Common Sense Media, to back a ballot initiative in California called the Parents & Kids Safe AI Act, setting guardrails around how chatbots interact with children. The measure proposes requiring AI companies to verify users’ age, offer parental controls, and undergo independent child-safety audits. If passed, it could be a blueprint for states across the country seeking to crack down on chatbots.

Fueled by widespread backlash against data centers, states will also try to regulate the resources needed to run AI. That means bills requiring data centers to report on their power and water use and foot their own electricity bills. If AI starts to displace jobs at scale, labor groups might float AI bans in specific professions. A few states concerned about the catastrophic risks posed by AI may pass safety bills mirroring SB 53 and the RAISE Act.

Meanwhile, tech titans will continue to use their deep pockets to crush AI regulations. Leading the Future, a super PAC backed by OpenAI president Greg Brockman and the venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz, will try to elect candidates who endorse unfettered AI development to Congress and state legislatures. They’ll follow the crypto industry’s playbook for electing allies and writing the rules. To counter this, super PACs funded by Public First, an organization run by Carson and former Republican congressman Chris Stewart of Utah, will back candidates advocating for AI regulation. We might even see a handful of candidates running on anti-AI populist platforms.

In 2026, the slow, messy process of American democracy will grind on. And the rules written in state capitals could decide how the most disruptive technology of our generation develops far beyond America’s borders, for years to come.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Warsaw, Poland 26 January 2026 – Rainbow Weather has raised $5.5 million in seed funding to push weather forecasting further into the short-term, high-precision territory it believes the industry still underserves.

The Warsaw-based climate tech startup focuses on hyperlocal, minute-by-minute forecasts, zeroing in on what happens in the next few hours rather than days out.

The round was backed by a syndicate of investors, including Yuri Gurski, founder of Flo Health, one of Europe’s best-known consumer tech unicorns.

Rainbow Weather’s core product is a mobile app that delivers four-hour precipitation forecasts calculated from the exact moment a user checks the weather.

Open the app at 3:51 am, and it forecasts conditions through 7:51am, refreshed every 10 minutes and mapped down to a one-square-kilometre grid. That level of temporal and spatial precision is what the company says sets it apart from mainstream weather apps.

Most major providers, including AccuWeather, Apple Weather, and The Weather Company, still rely on approaches that either simplify cloud movement or depend on large-scale numerical models designed for longer forecasts. According to Rainbow Weather, both methods struggle when conditions change quickly.

“Many legacy forecasting providers rely on optical flow for short-term precipitation forecasting. That’s a fast but simplistic method that treats clouds as shapes in motion, without any understanding of atmospheric physics,” explained Alexander Matveenko, co-founder of Rainbow Weather. “A second category of services uses large-scale mathematical models that do incorporate physical principles, but they’re so cumbersome and slow that they can’t respond quickly to real-time weather changes.”

Rainbow Weather positions itself in between, using machine learning to fuse high-resolution data from radar, satellites, weather stations, and even smartphone barometers. By combining these sources, the company claims it can reduce the noise and bias inherent in individual datasets, then generate forecasts faster than traditional systems.

The app currently focuses on short-term precipitation, but it has expanded into tracking wildfires and hurricanes, a feature added after the Palisades fire in Los Angeles. That expansion reflects a broader ambition to become a real-time risk awareness tool, not just a rain predictor.

The new funding will be used to extend Rainbow Weather’s forecasting window from four hours to 24 hours, add more weather parameters beyond precipitation, and grow its B2B offering.

The commercial weather intelligence market is expected to grow steadily over the next decade, driven by industries that depend on precise, near-term forecasts, from logistics and agriculture to aviation and drone operations.

Rainbow Weather says it has surpassed one million installs and has launched APIs aimed at companies that “can’t afford to get weather wrong.” It has also partnered with an unnamed long-term forecasting firm, supplying near-term data to improve broader climate models.

The founding team brings a track record of exits in applied AI. CEO Yuriy Melnichek previously founded AIMatter, acquired by Google, as well as consumer apps later bought by Pinterest and Farfetch. Matveenko previously sold mapping startup MapData to Mapbox.

Alongside its commercial products, the team also runs weatherindex.ai, an open-source project that evaluates short-term precipitation forecasts from major providers in real time. The tool compares live forecasts against verified airport weather reports, using standard accuracy metrics. It’s an unusual move in an industry not known for transparent benchmarking.

For Rainbow Weather, that openness is part of the pitch. The company is betting that as climate volatility increases, users and businesses will care less about next week’s weather and more about what happens in the next hour, and whether the forecast can be trusted.

Rainbow Weather is a next-gen climate tech startup for ultra-accurate short-term forecasts founded in 2021 by Yuriy Melnichek, who previously built AIMatter (acquired by Google), a neural network-based AI platform, as well as the video creation and editing app Vochi (acquired by Pinterest), and fashion marketplace Wanna (acquired by Farfetch), and Alexander Matveenko, a founder of artificial intelligence mapping startup MapData that he sold to Mapbox in 2017.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">London-based AI video startup Synthesia has raised $200 million in a Series E round, nearly doubling its valuation to around $4 billion and cementing its position as one of Europe’s most valuable AI companies.

The round was led by Google Ventures, with participation from existing investors, underscoring continued appetite for applied AI products that have already found a clear commercial use.

Synthesia builds generative AI tools that let companies create videos using AI-generated avatars instead of cameras, studios, or presenters. The technology has found a strong foothold in corporate training, internal communications, and product explainers, areas where speed, scale, and consistency often matter more than production gloss.

“Synthesia was founded on two core beliefs: first, that AI will bring the cost of content creation down to zero. And secondly, that AI video provides a better, more engaging way for organizations to communicate and learn,” said Victor Riparbelli, Synthesia’s co-founder and CEO.

Synthesia says a significant share of Fortune 100 companies now use its platform, a rare level of enterprise penetration for a European AI startup at this stage. Rather than chasing consumer virality, the company has built its business around predictable, high-value enterprise use cases, a strategy investors have increasingly rewarded over the past year.

The funding comes at a moment when enthusiasm around generative AI has shifted from experimentation to execution. Enterprises are no longer asking whether AI video works, but how reliably it can plug into existing workflows.

Synthesia’s pitch is that AI-generated video should be as routine as slides or documents, created quickly, updated easily, and deployed globally without production bottlenecks.

At a $4 billion valuation, Synthesia joins a small group of European AI companies that have managed to scale beyond regional relevance.

Its rise also highlights a broader pattern: applied AI startups, focused on specific business functions rather than general-purpose models, are attracting some of the largest growth rounds in the market.

For the UK tech ecosystem, the deal is another signal that London remains a serious hub for commercial AI, even as regulatory debates continue around model safety, copyright, and synthetic media.

Synthesia has previously positioned itself as cautious about misuse, building safeguards around consent and disclosure for its avatars, a stance that may become more important as scrutiny of AI-generated content increases.

The challenge ahead is less about proving demand and more about maintaining trust and differentiation as competitors multiply.

But with deep enterprise adoption, a clear product focus, and backing from one of Silicon Valley’s most influential investors, Synthesia is entering its next phase with momentum firmly on its side.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Amsterdam-based hospitality tech platform Mews has raised €255 million (about $300 million) in a Series D funding round as it pushes deeper into automation and AI-powered workflows for hotels around the world.

The round was led by EQT Growth with new participation from Atomico and HarbourVest Partners, alongside existing backers including Kinnevik, Battery Ventures and Tiger Global. The investment values the company at roughly $2.5 billion.

Founded in 2012 by Richard Valtr and Matt Welle, Mews builds a cloud-native “operating system” for hotels  software that ties together reservations, check-ins, housekeeping, payments and more in one platform.

Its technology is designed to replace legacy systems that many hotels still rely on, offering a more flexible, connected way to manage day-to-day operations.

The new funding will be used to expand the company’s AI and automation capabilities at the core of its product.

That includes embedding agent-driven systems that can take on complex routine tasks, reduce manual work for staff and streamline how hotels handle everything from guest interactions to revenue management.

Mews says its platform already supports more than 15,000 properties in 85 countries, and in 2025 it processed nearly 42.3 million check-ins and handled nearly $20 billion in transaction volume.

The software also helped generate over $500 million in additional revenue for hoteliers through features like its Mews Spaces module.

In a statement, CEO Matt Welle said the new capital will help Mews build an operating system that handles operational complexity so hotel teams can focus on guest experience rather than juggling disparate tools.

“We are engineering an operating system that is changing how hoteliers interact with their guests,” CEO Matt Welle said, adding that the goal is to lighten the cognitive load on staff and make everyday operations smoother.

Industry observers say the round is one of the largest ever in hospitality software and reflects broader investor interest in infrastructure-level platforms that bring AI and fintech together for real-world business operations.

As hotels embrace digital transformation, technology that can automate workflows and personalise guest experiences  without adding complexity is increasingly in demand.

For Mews, the challenge now is execution: turning generous funding into tangible upgrades that deliver value for hoteliers of all sizes.

But with strong adoption, a global footprint and a growing suite of automation tools, the company is positioning itself as a central technology partner at a time when hotels are looking to modernise their operations and enhance guest satisfaction.

            <h2>How Flippa Is Removing the Language Barrier from Global Deal-Making</h2>
            <p><strong>The Next Web | 2026-01-23</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://thenextweb.com/news/how-flippa-is-removing-the-language-barrier-from-global-deal-making">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">For decades, access to high-quality deal flow and sophisticated M&A infrastructure has been largely designed for well-connected investors and industry giants. Small businesses and independent founders, particularly those operating outside English-speaking markets, may often find the barriers even higher. Language, geography, and limited access to networks could mean that opportunity stops at the border.

Amidst this trend, Flippa, a platform for buying and selling digital businesses, is rewriting the script and dismantling those barriers. Under the leadership of CEO Blake Hutchison, the company has connected buyers and sellers across continents, linguistic differences, and price points, closing deals from $100,000 up to $10 million. Now, with the launch of its AI-powered multi-language Deal Room, Flippa is addressing what it sees as one of the last major points of disadvantage in global business deals and M&A, calling it the “Language Tax.”

Founded in 2009, Flippa has grown into a global marketplace where entrepreneurs can buy and sell digital assets ranging from e-commerce stores and SaaS businesses to YouTube channels, online communities, and mobile applications. According to Hutchison, the platform supports users from 189 countries, attracting over 450,000 new buyers in the last two years alone. “Our internal data shows that cross-border transactions now account for approximately 85% of all deals completed on the platform,” Hutchison says. “That growth has been especially pronounced in Europe. As a highly fragmented market with high cross-border trade volume but multiple operating languages, I believe Europe often faces structural friction in cross-border dealmaking.”

He notes that European businesses are increasingly being acquired by international buyers, with US-based acquirers representing a significant share of demand. Yet, as deal volumes continue to decline, Hutchison believes that language barriers have historically slowed or derailed otherwise viable transactions.

The company’s new multi-language Deal Room is designed to remove that friction entirely. Within the Deal Room, Hutchison notes that buyers and sellers can now negotiate and transact in their preferred languages. “For example, a French seller can communicate in French with an Italian or English-speaking buyer, who receives the message instantly translated into their own language,” he says, explaining how replies can be translated back in real time, while preserving the original message for verification and clarity.

Hutchison states, “Our goal is to make deal-making as efficient and approachable as possible. Whether you are a SaaS founder in Paris or an e-commerce operator in Berlin, you should be able to negotiate your exit in the language of your choice.”

Alongside the Deal Room translation tool, Flippa has also launched a fully localized French version of its platform, with Spanish scheduled to follow shortly. The expansion reflects the user demand and the reality that French and Spanish are not only widely spoken across Europe, but globally. Spanish is spoken by 550 million people globally, and is spoken widely across the US and Brazil. Similarly, French, being the 5th most widely spoken language in the world, has 321 million speakers, with 61.8% of those speakers living in parts of North Africa and Sub-Saharan Africa, significantly extending the global reach of European-founded businesses.

According to Hutchison, this shift comes as Europe’s M&A market continues to rise again, with an estimated USD412 billion in deal value, with mid-market and digital-first businesses representing one of the fastest-growing segments. Flippa’s role, according to Hutchison, has been to create infrastructure for businesses to source deals with greater reach than elite investment banks, but with a fraction of the cost.

“We often describe Flippa as the investment bank for the 99%,” Hutchison says. “The difference now is that geography and language no longer define who gets access. The demand for cross-border deals was already there. The technology simply needed to catch up.”

Flippa continues to integrate AI-driven discovery, valuation, and outreach tools through its proprietary LaurenAI engine. “The model is trained on more than 200,000 historical listings and transactions,” he explains. “The system then helps buyers identify opportunities, estimate enterprise value, and initiate conversations at scale.” It autonomously indexes the web to identify businesses across SaaS, e-commerce, apps, publishing, and next-generation media.

Human expertise remains embedded in the process, with certified brokers and M&A professionals supporting transactions once a match is made. As Hutchison puts it, “LaurenAI gives people the ability to access off-market deals and build pipelines the same way Wall Street players do, but without the barriers of capital or connections.”

He notes that entrepreneurs who may not feel confident negotiating complex deal terms in English can now access global liquidity without intermediaries or external advisors. At the same time, international buyers can gain visibility into high-quality European businesses that were previously difficult to source or engage.

As digital entrepreneurship continues to globalize, Flippa is positioning itself at the center of a more inclusive M&A ecosystem, one where language is no longer a tax on ambition and opportunities. Flippa’s multi-language Deal Room represents a structural shift in how global deal-making can be done. For founders and buyers alike, it signals a future where the next meaningful transaction can begin in any language, from anywhere in the world.

            <h2>French fintech Pennylane raises €175M</h2>
            <p><strong>The Next Web | 2026-01-23</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://thenextweb.com/news/french-fintech-pennylane-raises-e175m">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Paris-based fintech Pennylane has just pulled off one of Europe’s most noteworthy funding rounds of the year, announcing €175 million in new capital to accelerate its push into artificial intelligence and expand its footprint across the continent. 
The round was led by growth investor TCV, with participation from Blackstone Growth and a group of existing backers that includes Sequoia Capital, DST Global, CapitalG and Meritech Capital.

What makes this raise stand out isn’t just the size of the cheque, though €175 million is hard to ignore in a selective funding market, but the strategic timing and purpose behind it. Pennylane says it didn’t need the capital to survive; it chose to raise now to double down on AI product development and prepare for a phase of market consolidation in European financial software.

Since its founding in 2020, Pennylane has positioned itself as more than just an accounting tool. It has built what it calls a financial operating system for small and mid-sized businesses and the accountants who serve them, bringing invoicing, payments, bookkeeping, and cash-flow management into a shared platform.

That unified approach taps a persistent pain point in Europe’s SME economy, where many companies still stitch together separate systems to manage their finances.

The new funds will support expanded R&D, particularly in generative AI, with early efforts already focused on building intelligent assistants that help accountants interpret data, automate routine bookkeeping, and deliver richer insights to their clients.

The company is also gearing up for regulatory shifts, including electronic invoicing mandates rolling out across several EU countries and refining localisation for key markets like Germany.

Pennylane’s latest round reportedly values the company at about $4.25 billion (€3.6 billion), reinforcing its unicorn status and standing among Europe’s higher-valued fintech startups. That valuation reflects both investor confidence and the company’s growing footprint: Pennylane is used by thousands of accounting firms and hundreds of thousands of businesses across several European markets.

This deal also underscores a broader trend in European tech: AI is moving beyond buzzy chatbots and large language models into critical business infrastructure.

Fintech tools, compliance software, and productivity platforms are increasingly weaving machine learning and automation into once manual workflows. For accountants juggling multiple clients in different jurisdictions, AI isn’t a luxury; it’s a practical way to keep up with regulatory complexity and expectations for real-time financial insights.

Strategically, Pennylane’s timing matters. European financial software is under pressure to modernise rapidly as digital tax reporting and e-invoicing standards become the norm rather than the exception.

By raising capital now, even without immediate pressure,  Pennylane is planting a flag as these shifts accelerate. The presence of heavyweight global investors like TCV and Blackstone signals that international capital still sees promise in Europe’s SaaS and AI stack.

But there’s a deeper dynamic at play. In Europe, fintech innovation often means balancing diversification with consolidation. Investors backing Pennylane now are betting that the company can serve as a common platform for both accountants and SMEs across borders, a role that gets harder as local regulatory regimes and market expectations diverge.

Generative AI, if deployed thoughtfully, could be what ties all those variations together, letting the platform adapt to local tax rules or reporting needs without keeping teams chained to repetitive work.

From Berlin to Barcelona, founders and investors alike are watching to see whether this latest bet on AI financial tooling pays off. In a funding landscape where some sectors have tightened, and valuations have been scrutinised, Pennylane’s ability to attract major global backers while maintaining founder control and avoiding unnecessary dilution signals that Europe’s fintech scene still has room to grow.

For businesses and accountants alike, the surge in capital behind AI-first tools could translate into more seamless workflows, smarter insights, and faster decision-making.

And if Pennylane’s vision plays out, it might not just be a win for one French unicorn, but a sign that European software can innovate too, not by mimicking Silicon Valley, but by solving problems that are uniquely local, and increasingly global.
