            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Last year delivered doses of drama and excitement in the space business, with a record number of launches, breathtaking vistas of other worlds, and a multitude of breakthroughs and setbacks. 2026 is shaping up to be another thrilling year in the cosmos.

For the first time in more than 54 years, astronauts are training to travel to the vicinity of the Moon, perhaps within the next couple of months. NASA, SpaceX, Blue Origin, and other companies are poised to take major steps toward actually landing humans on the Moon, perhaps within a few years.

New rockets are slated to debut in 2026, and scientists hope to open new windows on the Universe. Here, we list the most anticipated space missions scheduled for this year, ranked according to our own anticipation for them. We also assess the chances of these missions actually happening in the next 12 months. Unless specified, we don’t assess the chances of a successful outcome.

Final preparations for the Artemis II mission are well underway at NASA’s Kennedy Space Center in Florida, with the Space Launch System rocket and Orion spacecraft fully integrated inside the Vehicle Assembly Building. Within a couple of weeks, the SLS rocket could roll to Launch Complex 39B for a countdown dress rehearsal. Then, perhaps in February, the Artemis II mission is scheduled to depart Florida’s Space Coast on a 10-day flight that will carry astronauts Reid Wiseman, Victor Glover, Christina Koch, and Jeremy Hansen around the far side of the Moon and back to Earth. This will be the first crew flight on the SLS rocket and Orion capsule. Even if delays prevent a launch in February, Artemis II is well-positioned to fly by spring or summer. Chance of Artemis II happening in 2026: 90 percent.

The next mission on our list is on SpaceX’s Starship roadmap for 2026. A demonstration of large-scale orbital refueling is key to unlocking Starship’s ability to travel beyond low-Earth orbit. SpaceX must master its refueling capability before sending Starships to the Moon to fulfill the company’s lunar lander contract with NASA. The same can be said for SpaceX’s future plans for Starship flights to Mars. This first refueling demo will involve two Starship launches from separate launch pads in Texas, or perhaps Florida. The ships will link up together in orbit, and one will attempt to transfer super-cold methane and liquid oxygen propellants to the other. Cryogenic refueling has never been tried at this scale in space before. Chance of a refueling demo happening in 2026: 50 percent.

SpaceX plans to debut its next version of Starship—Starship Version 3, or V3, with an inaugural test flight in the next few months. This first flight of Starship V3 will look a lot like SpaceX’s past Starship test flights, with the rocket launching from South Texas and flying on a suborbital arc halfway around the world for a precise ocean landing.

If that goes well, SpaceX could take the next step in Starship development on the following flight. This will entail launching Starship—the world’s largest rocket—into low-Earth orbit and bringing the ship back for a reentry over northern Mexico and recovery back at SpaceX’s test facility at Starbase, Texas. There, the ship will be caught back at its launch pad with giant mechanical arms, similar to how SpaceX has recovered the rocket’s Super Heavy booster. A successful catch would be a major leap toward making Starship fully reusable. Chance of a successful Starship catch happening in 2026: 70 percent.

Blue Origin’s first lunar lander is a behemoth. If successful, the Blue Moon Mark 1 cargo lander will become the largest spacecraft to ever set down on the lunar surface. The craft stands more than 26 feet (8 meters) tall and is more than 10 feet (3 meters) in diameter. Engineers in Florida are finishing up assembly of the first Blue Moon Mark 1 before shipping it to Houston for environmental testing.

The lander will then travel back to Cape Canaveral for preparations to fly on top of Blue Origin’s New Glenn rocket. The company’s current plan is to launch the Moon lander on a New Glenn rocket some time this year. The unpiloted lander’s first jaunt to the Moon will take on greater importance as engineers study the possibility of modifying future Blue Moon Mark 1s for astronauts. Chance of Blue Moon Mark 1 launching in 2026: 70 percent.

Rocket Lab has comfortably held second place among US rocket companies for number of launches per year. The company’s light-class launcher, the Electron, surpassed a monthly launch cadence in 2025. Rocket Lab’s next rocket, the medium-lift Neutron, will open new markets for the company. Neutron is designed with a reusable first stage and integrated payload fairing, which will return to Earth in one piece after releasing the rocket’s expendable upper stage to accelerate into orbit.

The launch pad at Wallops Island, Virginia, is complete, but the rocket wasn’t ready to meet Rocket Lab’s goal of a first flight by the end of 2025. Rocket Lab’s founder, Peter Beck, has a history of giving his team ambitious schedules for the first flight of Neutron. His latest projection calls for delivering the first Neutron rocket to the launch site in the first quarter of 2026, “with first launch thereafter.” Chance of Neutron launching in 2026: 50 percent.

Unlike Rocket Lab, Stoke Space has no experience in launching orbital rockets, but the company’s founders have an impressive pedigree with long tenures overseeing propulsion projects at Blue Origin. Stoke’s first rocket, the Nova, is officially scheduled to fly for the first time in 2026. Construction is in an advanced stage for Nova’s launch site at Cape Canaveral, while Nova’s first and second stages underwent qualification testing last year.

Engineers completed the first hot-fire test of the rocket’s first stage engine in 2024 in Washington state, following earlier tests of the upper stage propulsion system. What’s unique about Nova is that it’s designed for full reusability, with a recoverable booster and upper stage. Stoke is the only company besides SpaceX that seems close to actually test-flying a fully reusable rocket. Chance of Nova launching in 2026: 30 percent.

China’s goal of landing astronauts on the Moon by 2030 is now less than five years away, and a critical test of the country’s new human-rated spacecraft is scheduled for launch sometime in 2026. The partially reusable Mengzhou spacecraft is designed to carry up to seven people to the China’s Tiangong space station or a smaller crew on voyages to the Moon, eventually replacing China’s Shenzhou crew capsule tailored for low-Earth orbit missions.

Mengzhou is akin to NASA’s Orion spacecraft or Apollo command module and is a key element of China’s lunar architecture, along with a human-rated lander named Lanyue, which will make its debut in space on a separate mission. It will launch on China’s new Long March 10A rocket, which the China Manned Space Agency says will make its first flight along with Mengzhou—likely uncrewed—some time this year. We’ve seen hot-fire testing of the rocket’s booster stage in recent months, and China typically does not publicize launch schedules without believing they are realistic. Chance of Long March 10A and Mengzhou launching in 2026: 60 percent.

The first of several reusable rockets under development in China launched in early December. The medium-class Zhuque-3 rocket, developed by a commercial startup named LandSpace, successfully reached orbit on its debut flight, a remarkable achievement in its own right. But LandSpace’s attempt to land the rocket’s first stage booster downrange showed it is close to recovering—and eventually reusing—a Zhuque-3 booster stage.

The rocket failed during its landing burn moments before landing, then crashed right next to its landing pad in the Gobi Desert. LandSpace will try again with Zhuque-3, and other companies have rockets that will make similar attempts in the coming months. Chance of a Chinese orbital-class rocket making a successful landing in 2026: 60 percent.

If you look at public schedules, the California-based company Vast seems to have a significant head start in the race to put a commercial space station in orbit before the International Space Station’s retirement in 2030. Vast’s first crewed habitat, named Haven-1, is under construction for launch on a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket, followed by the first of up to four visits by private crews on SpaceX’s Dragon spacecraft, with each stay lasting up to 10 days. This capability is far short of the permanent human presence supported by the ISS, but a successful launch and activation of Haven-1 would be a significant accomplishment for the commercial space industry.

Vast aims to follow Haven-1 with a larger space station to accommodate visitors for longer stays. So what’s the status of Haven-1? The primary structure of the flight module completed structural testing in October and was set to undergo final weld inspections and integration soon thereafter. Vast’s most recent public schedule called for the launch of Haven-1 as soon as May 2026, but it seems likely to take longer than that to fully outfit the module’s interior, which appeared bare during structural testing earlier this fall. Chance of Haven-1 launching in 2026: 30 percent.

The next of NASA’s flagship-class astronomical observatories is now fully assembled at Goddard Space Flight Center in Maryland. The Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope, named for NASA’s first chief astronomer, will have a field of view at least 100 times larger than the Hubble Space Telescope. Roman’s primary science instrument will perform wide-area surveys of the Universe, covering 50 times more of the sky in five years than Hubble did in its first 30 years.

A secondary coronagraph instrument will advance astronomers’ ability to directly image exoplanets. NASA announced in December that assembly of Roman was completed, kicking off a series of environmental tests before its scheduled launch no earlier than September on a SpaceX Falcon Heavy rocket. Chance of the Roman Space Telescope launching in 2026: 80 percent.

The next robotic mission in China’s lunar exploration program is scheduled for launch as soon as August 2026. Chang’e 7 won’t repeat China’s past feat of returning samples from the Moon, but it will have its share of firsts. The lander will attempt to set down in the Moon’s south pole region and deploy a miniature flying probe to search for water ice in cold traps hidden on the floors of dark craters. The target landing site is on the rim of Shackleton Crater, which is within range of cold, unlit regions thought to harbor water ice. If successful, Chang’e 7 will be the first mission to locate and characterize water ice deposits on the lunar surface, beating similar US missions to the Moon by a year or more. Chance of Chang’e 7 launching in 2026: 80 percent.

Similar to the way we addressed China’s emerging reusable rockets, we decided to group Europe’s new startup launch companies together in a single entry. Three of these European companies say they are targeting the first flight of their small satellite launchers in 2026. One is Isar Aerospace, headquartered near Munich, which launched its first Spectrum rocket in March 2025. The rocket didn’t make it far, but Isar is gearing up for a second orbital launch attempt in the early weeks of 2026.

Trailing behind Isar is Rocket Factory Augsburg, another German company, which appeared to be on track to launch its first RFA One rocket before a fiery accident during a test-firing in 2024. PLD Space of Spain is targeting a first flight of its Miura 5 rocket in 2026, although it seems to be lagging behind Isar Aerospace and Rocket Factory Augsburg. Other serious contenders in the European small launch arena include MaiaSpace of France and Germany’s HyImpulse. Both appear to have delayed their first orbital launch attempts to 2027. Chance of a European launch startup reaching orbit in 2026: 20 percent.

Relativity Space is officially targeting the first flight of its heavy-lift Terran R rocket in late 2026, but there is reason for skepticism. At its Long Beach, California, headquarters, Relativity is wrapping up welding on the first stage, second stage, and interstage adapter for Terran R’s first flight, while also installing internal fluid lines to flow propellant to the rocket’s engines. Each stage is expected to undergo structural testing and acceptance testing at NASA’s Stennis Space Center in Mississippi before shipment to Cape Canaveral, Florida, for launch preparations. At Stennis, Relativity is performing acceptance testing on first stage engines and continuing developmental testing on Terran R’s upper stage engine. Construction is still in full swing at the Terran R’s launch pad in Florida. Chance of Terran R’s first launch in 2026: 10 percent.

Another rocket that is officially scheduled to launch in late 2026 is Eclipse, the new medium-lift launcher under joint development by Firefly Aerospace and Northrop Grumman. On paper, the Eclipse rocket is at about the same stage of development as Relativity’s Terran R. The most recent update from Firefly indicated the company has completed more than 100 hot-fire tests of the Eclipse’s Miranda main engine, more than Relativity has done with its Aeon R main engine. Relativity is already test-firing its upper stage engine, while Firefly has not yet achieved that milestone. Chance of Eclipse’s first launch in 2026: 20 percent.

The first US company to put a spacecraft on the Moon plans to return to the lunar surface in 2026. Intuitive Machines is preparing to launch its third Nova-C lander in the second half of the year, but it hasn’t released a more specific schedule. In the company’s most recent quarterly update, officials said they are targeting May 2026 for a flight readiness review, the last review before shipping the spacecraft to the launch site in Florida.

Intuitive Machines’ first two landers toppled over after landing but still returned some limited science data to Earth. The next lander will incorporate updated navigation sensors to help guide it to a gentle touchdown in the Reiner Gamma region on the Moon’s near side. A secondary payload will hitch a ride to space on the same launcher with IM-3. The Vestri mission from the asteroid mining company AstroForge will head into the Solar System and attempt to land on a metal-rich asteroid. Chance of IM-3 and Vestri launching in 2026: 50 percent.

Firefly Aerospace’s Blue Ghost lunar lander completed the first-ever fully successful commercial mission on the Moon’s surface last March. The next Blue Ghost mission is more ambitious, with a landing targeted for the far side of the Moon “as early as 2026,” Firefly says. The next mission actually consists of three spacecraft, with a Blue Ghost lander aiming for the lunar far side, a Firefly-built Elytra orbiter for data relay, and a European Space Agency (ESA) orbiter called Lunar Pathfinder.

This will be the first US mission to attempt a landing on the lunar far side, following two Chinese landers that touched down on the back side of the Moon in 2019 and 2024. Updates from Firefly suggest the company is still in the early stages of manufacturing flight hardware for Blue Ghost Mission 2, while an ESA website shows a target launch schedule no earlier than November 2026. Chance of Blue Ghost Mission 2 launching in 2026: 10 percent.

Astroscale, a company founded with the purpose of cleaning up space debris, has pivoted to pursuing the more lucrative market of satellite servicing. Many of the key technologies needed for space debris cleanup, such as rendezvous and proximity operations, are also applicable to Astroscale’s new focus. Astroscale launched a satellite last year to approach a derelict Japanese rocket in low-Earth orbit, marking the first time any mission has inspected a piece of space junk.

Astroscale’s next mission will go for another first: refueling a US military satellite above geosynchronous orbit more than 22,000 miles (36,000 kilometers) above the Earth. Western analysts believe China completed the first geosynchronous satellite refueling mission in 2025, and Astroscale’s contract with the US Space Force will attempt to do the same. The most recent schedule available for this mission shows a launch in mid-2026. Chance of Astroscale’s refueler launching in 2026: 50 percent.

The European Space Agency’s next medium-class science mission, named for the Greek philosopher Plato, could become the most prolific planet hunter ever sent into space. Fitted with 26 ultra-sensitive cameras, Plato will search for exoplanets by detecting tiny dips in light as planets pass in front of other stars. Some estimates suggest Plato could discover several thousand to several tens of thousands of extrasolar worlds, doubling or tripling the number of exoplanets in the confirmed archive.

Plato is specifically designed to find Sun-Earth analogs, potentially habitable rocky planets around stars like the Sun. These are expected to be a small percentage of Plato’s total planet haul. Preparations for Plato’s launch appear to be going well. ESA said ground teams finished assembling the observatory in October, and Plato will spend the coming months in vibration, acoustic, and thermal vacuum testing. The mission has at least two months of schedule margin for its official launch date in December 2026. But given the launch is scheduled for so late in the year, there is a chance a minor delay could push the start of Plato’s mission into 2027. Chance of Plato launching in 2026: 60 percent.

India has lofty ambitions for its space program, including a heavy-lift rocket, a space station in low-Earth orbit, and eventually human landings on the Moon. The precursor to many of these objectives is Gaganyaan, India’s human spaceflight program. Gaganyaan has been in full-scale development since winning approval from the Indian government in 2018. The Gaganyaan program still has government backing, but India has a history of announcing unrealistic schedules for the spacecraft’s initial test flights.

The first uncrewed orbital test flight of the Gaganyaan capsule has been mere months away for the last five years. The first test flight is currently slated for the first quarter of 2026. India’s space agency has reported some progress in 2025, such as human-rating the capsule’s LVM3 launch vehicle, installation of the spacecraft’s propulsion system, and parachute tests. But it’s a good idea to be skeptical of any of India’s schedules until officials provide more meaningful updates. Chance of Gaganyaan-1 launching in 2026: 30 percent.

This is an exciting mission, but the most dramatic part of MMX’s journey will come after it arrives at Mars in 2027. MMX will attempt to land on the Martian moon Phobos up to two times and collect samples for a return to Earth. The mission is poised to begin with a launch in October to start its journey to Mars. The launch was previously set for 2024, but Japan’s space agency delayed it due to problems with the country’s new H3 rocket.

The H3 scored a series of successful flights until December, when it failed to deliver a Japanese navigation satellite to orbit. There’s still time for engineers to investigate the failure and return the H3 to flight before MMX’s planetary launch window in October, but the H3 failure introduced some doubt into a scheduled that seemed assured before last month. The fully integrated MMX spacecraft underwent environmental testing throughout 2025. MMX builds on Japan’s successful Hayabusa 2 mission, which brought specimens from an asteroid back to Earth in 2020. If all goes according to plan, samples from Phobos should be back on Earth in 2031. Chance of MMX launching in 2026: 80 percent.</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Motorola is no stranger to foldables, having revived the Razr as a flip-style foldable phone in 2020. Now that it has a few iterations of modern flip phones under its belt, Moto is embarking on a new challenge: big foldables. The new (and thoroughly leaked) Motorola Razr Fold is a book-style foldable like Samsung’s Galaxy Z Fold and Google’s Pixel Fold lines, offering a smartphone-sized external display with a big foldable panel inside.

Motorola is taking the opportunity to reveal the phone at CES, but it’s far from ready for launch. Currently, Motorola is aiming to release the Razr Fold this coming summer for an unknown amount of money—Motorola won’t confirm pricing or really much of anything about the Razr Fold at this time.

What we do know is the device will be about as big as other large foldable phones, featuring a 6.6-inch external display and an 8.1-inch internal one. Moto says the main foldable OLED panel will have a 2K resolution, which means roughly 2,000 pixels tall. Again, this is similar to existing foldables.

The Razr Fold will be compatible with the new Moto Pen Ultra, an active stylus designed with the Fold in mind. This will at least set the Razr Fold apart from the competition. Samsung supported the S Pen stylus on several generations of its Z Fold line, but that ended with 2025’s Galaxy Z Fold 7. Moto will integrate stylus support in its stock apps, but there’s no word on third-party support, which was always the S Pen’s downfall.

We’re still months out from any firm release details, so it’s not surprising that Moto is playing this one close to the chest. One of the few things Moto is willing to talk about is the camera setup, probably because it feels the comparison between the Razr Fold and similar devices will be flattering. And it is… kind of.

The Razr Fold will have a triple 50MP camera system. Some foldable devices like the Galaxy Z Fold 7 have flagship-level main sensors, but the others are a big step down due to space constraints. Motorola will use a 50MP Sony Lytia sensor for the primary, along with a 50MP ultrawide (with macro) and a 50MP 3x telephoto. The camera module adds a fair bit of chunk to the back panel—it looks to almost double the thickness of the phone in that area, but Moto has not released official measurements to confirm that.

Motorola is offering a few hints about how the software on this phone will work, but unsurprisingly, there’s a lot we don’t know. For instance, it’s launching in the summer, so does that mean it will run Android 17? Google changed the release schedule in 2025 to account for the glut of new Android devices that launch each summer.

We are also told the Razr Fold’s software will take advantage of the form factor with “flexible layouts, “adaptive interfaces,” and “multitasking enhancements.” The company declined to elaborate on how any of those will work. Motorola will continue offering AI features like Catch Me Up and Pay Attention, but they’re joined by a new AI experience called Qira, which the company says will be accessible across both Motorola and Lenovo devices.

The idea is that Qira remembers your context from other devices, allowing you to take action across apps, create documents, and get supposedly useful reminders. Qira will launch on Lenovo laptops soon, with Motorola phones in the Edge and Razr family soon after. The new AI platform, which relies on technology from the likes of Microsoft and Perplexity, will be available on the Razr Fold at launch.

We also have no idea what Motorola will charge for this phone. Most book-style foldables retail for around $2,000, and the components that go into these phones are not getting cheaper. In fact, many of them could be getting much more expensive in 2026. When pressed, Motorola refuses to even offer a ballpark estimate of MSRP. We should get more details on the Razr Fold specs and pricing as the summer launch window approaches.</div>

            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2026/01/hps-eliteboard-g1a-is-a-ryzen-powered-windows-11-pc-in-a-membrane-keyboard/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">As a Windows system built inside of a functioning membrane keyboard, the HP EliteBoard G1a announced today is a more accessible alternative to other keyboard-PCs.

The Commodore 64 made the keyboard-PC famous in the 1980s, but the keyboard-PC space has been dominated by the Raspberry Pi. In 2019, the single-board computer (SBC) maker released the Raspberry Pi 400, which is essentially a Raspberry Pi 4 SBC inside a case that also functions as a keyboard for the system. USB, HDMI, and Ethernet ports, plus a GPIO header and native Raspberry Pi OS Linux distribution add up to a low-end desktop computer experience that only costs $100. It was followed by the Raspberry Pi 500, with a Pi 5 powered by a quad-core, 64-bit Arm Cortex-A76 inside; and the Pi 500+, which has an NVMe SSD, instead of microSD, storage and is built inside of a low-profile mechanical keyboard (it’s also twice as expensive at $200).

But Raspberry Pis largely appeal to tinkerers, DIYers, and Linux fans, making Pi-as-a-desktop a niche product with a substantial learning curve for newcomers.

Alternatively, HP’s EliteBoard will bring Windows and a more powerful x86 architecture to the keyboard-PC form factor. HP says the EliteBoard will support Windows 11 Pro for Business and an AMD Ryzen AI 300-series processor with an up to 50 TOPs NPU. The device will be sold with a 32 W internal battery and is part of Microsoft’s Copilot+ PC program.

The EliteBoard is aimed at workplaces that would benefit from ultraportable computers that can be quickly set up, such as corporate offices where employees don’t have assigned seats (also known as hot desking). In its announcement, HP said that the EliteBoard, which weighs 1.65 pounds, was built to “move, connect, and adapt to any workspace with ease.”

HP hasn’t released further specs, but based on what we do know, the EliteBoard will have limited computing power, especially compared to other Windows 11 business PCs. Still, the unique system is set to bring new capabilities and a familiar interface to keyboard-PCs. It could garner deeper interest for the category from IT departments seeking easy hybrid workplace solutions, makers, and minimalists interested in experimenting,

HP is demoing the keyboard-PC at CES 2026 in Las Vegas this week and plans to release it in March. It hasn’t set a price yet.</div>

            <h2>With GeForce Super GPUs missing in action, Nvidia focuses on software upgrades</h2>
            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-01-06</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2026/01/nvidia-leans-on-dlss-improvements-to-make-up-for-a-lack-of-gpus-at-ces/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">For the first time in years, Nvidia declined to introduce new GeForce graphics card models at CES. CEO Jensen Huang’s characteristically sprawling and under-rehearsed 90-minute keynote focused almost entirely on the company’s dominant AI business, relegating the company’s gaming-related announcements to a separate video posted later in the evening.

Instead, the company focused on software improvements for its existing hardware. The biggest announcement in this vein is DLSS 4.5, which adds a handful of new features to Nvidia’s basket of upscaling and frame-generation technologies.

DLSS upscaling is being improved by a new “second-generation transformer model” that Nvidia says has been “trained on an expanded data set” to improve its predictions when generating new pixels. According to Nvidia’s Bryan Catanzaro, this is particularly beneficial for image quality in the Performance and Ultra Performance modes, where the upscaler has to do more guessing because it’s working from a lower-resolution source image.

DLSS Multi-Frame Generation is also improving, increasing the number of AI-generated frames per rendered frame from three to five. This new 6x mode for DLSS MFG is being paired with something called Dynamic Multi-Frame Generation, where the number of AI-generated frames can dynamically change, increasing generated frames during “demanding scenes,” and decreasing the number of generated frames during simpler scenes “so it only computes what’s needed.”

The standard caveats for Multi-Frame Generation still apply: It needs an RTX 50-series GPU (the 40-series can still only generate one frame for every rendered frame, and older cards can’t generate extra frames at all), and the game needs to be running at a reasonably high base frame rate to minimize lag and weird rendering artifacts. It remains a useful tool for making fast-running games run faster, but it won’t help make an unplayable frame rate into a playable one.

To Nvidia’s credit, the new DLSS 4.5 transformer model runs on GeForce 20- and 30-series GPUs, giving users of older-but-still-usable graphics cards access to the improved upscaling. But Nvidia said that owners of those GPUs would see more of a performance hit from enabling DLSS 4.5 than users of GeForce 40- and 50-series cards would, and initial testing from some outlets seems to be bearing that out. Compared to the DLSS 4.0 transformer model, Mostly Positive Reviews found that the new DLSS 4.5 model reduced performance on an RTX 3080 Ti by between 14 and 24 percent, depending on the game and the settings, though performance is still presumably better than it would be on the same card if you tried to run those games at native resolutions.

The DLSS 4.5 transformer model is available now, after a driver update, and you can use the Nvidia App to select the new transformer model in games that already support DLSS upscaling (whether the option appears in any in-game menus remains up to the game developer). The Multi-Frame Generation updates will be available sometime in spring 2026.

One feature that hasn’t broken cover yet? Nvidia’s Reflex 2, an update to its input lag-reduction technology that the company announced at CES last year. Upscaling and frame-generation technologies generally add extra input latency, something that Reflex helps to offset, and the company claimed an up to 75 percent reduction in lag when using Reflex 2 on a 50-series card. But Nvidia didn’t mention Reflex 2 this year and hasn’t provided any updates on when it might be released.

In another era, CES 2026 would have been a good time to introduce a 50-series Super update, a mid-generation spec bump to keep the lineup fresh while Nvidia works on whatever will become the GeForce 60-series. The company used CES 2024 to launch the RTX 40-series Super cards, helping improve the value proposition for a bunch of cards that had launched at prices many reviewers and users grumbled about.

Indeed, the rumor mill suggested that Nvidia was working on a 50-series Super refresh for the 2025 holiday season, and its biggest improvement was going to be a 50 percent bump in RAM capacity, said to be possible because of a switch from 2GB RAM chips to 3GB chips. This would have given the theoretical 5070 Super 18GB of RAM, and the 5070 Ti Super and 5080 Super were said to have 24GB of memory.

Assuming those rumors are correct, those plans could have been dashed by the abrupt RAM shortages and price spikes that started late last year. These have been caused at least in part by sky-high demand for RAM from AI data centers; given that modern-day Nvidia is mainly an AI company that sells consumer GPUs on the side, it stands to reason that the company would allocate all the RAM it can get to its more profitable AI GPUs, rather than a mid-generation GeForce refresh.

In fact, none of the major dedicated GPU manufacturers has introduced new products at CES this year. AMD and Intel announced products with improved integrated GPUs, which use system RAM rather than requiring their own. But there wasn’t a peep about any new dedicated Radeon cards, and Intel hasn’t introduced a new dedicated Arc graphics card in almost a year, despite some signs that a midrange Arc B770 card exists and could be nearly ready to launch.</div>

            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2026/01/letting-prisons-jam-contraband-phones-is-a-bad-idea-phone-companies-tell-fcc/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">A Federal Communications Commission proposal to let state and local prisons jam contraband cell phones has support from Republican attorneys general and prison phone companies but faces opposition from wireless carriers that say it would disrupt lawful communications. Groups dedicated to Wi-Fi and GPS also raised concerns in comments to the FCC.

“Jamming will block all communications, not just communications from contraband devices,” wireless lobby group CTIA said in December 29 comments in response to Chairman Brendan Carr’s proposal. The CTIA said that “jamming blocks all communications, including lawful communications such as 911 calling,” and argued that the FCC “has no authority to allow jamming.”

CTIA members AT&T and Verizon expressed their displeasure in separate comments to the FCC. “The proposed legal framework is based on a flawed factual premise,” AT&T wrote.

While the Communications Act prohibits interference with authorized radio communications, Carr’s plan tries to sidestep this prohibition by proposing to de-authorize certain communications, AT&T wrote. “This legal framework, however, is premised on a fundamental factual error: the assumption that jammers will only block ‘unauthorized’ communications without impacting lawful uses. There is no way to jam some communications on a spectrum band but not others,” AT&T wrote.

Previous FCC leaders recognized the problem that radio jammers can’t differentiate between contraband and legitimate devices, AT&T said. “As explained above, there are no technical workarounds to that limitation with respect to jammers,” AT&T wrote.

In 2013, the FCC explained that jamming systems transmit on the same frequencies as their targets in order to disrupt the links between devices and network base stations and that this process “render[s] any wireless device operating on those frequencies unusable. When used to disrupt wireless devices, radio signal jammers cannot differentiate between contraband devices and legitimate devices, including devices making 911 calls. Radio signal jammers block all wireless communications on affected spectrum bands.”

That apparently hasn’t changed. The FCC’s new proposal issued in September 2025 said the commission’s “understanding is that jamming solutions block calls on all affected frequencies and… are unable to allow 911 calls to be transmitted.” But the proposal indicates this may be an acceptable outcome, as “some state DOC [Department of Corrections] officials have indicated that correctional facilities typically do not allow any calls from within, including emergency calls.”

If the FCC adopts its plan, it would “authorize, for the first time, non-federal operation of radio frequency (RF) jamming solutions in correctional facilities,” the proposal said.

Carr said in September that previous FCC actions, such as authorizing “contraband interdiction systems” and letting wireless carriers disable contraband phones at a prison’s request, have not been enough. “Contraband cellphones have been pouring into state and local prisons by the tens of thousands every year,” Carr said. “They are used to run drug operations, orchestrate kidnappings, and further criminal enterprises in communities all across the country.”

Carr said that prisons and jails will not be required to install jamming systems and that the FCC “proposes to authorize targeted jamming. Jamming technology can be precise enough that it does not interrupt the regular communications of law enforcement or community members in the vicinity.” The FCC proposal asks the public for comment on “restrictions that might prove necessary to ensure that jamming solutions are limited to this targeted use, and to mitigate the risk that these solutions are deployed in contexts other than a correctional facility environment.”

Jamming has support from 23 state attorneys general, all Republicans, who told the FCC that “inmates routinely use smuggled phones to coordinate criminal enterprises, intimidate witnesses, and orchestrate violence both inside and outside prison walls.” More jamming support came from the state Department of Corrections in both Florida and South Carolina.

Prison phone companies that would financially benefit from increased use of official phone systems also support jamming cell phones. Global Tel*Link (aka ViaPath) called the plan “one more tool to help combat the serious problem of contraband wireless devices in correctional facilities.”

NCIC Correctional Services, another prison phone firm, said that jamming to create “‘dead zones’ within correctional facilities would permit smaller jails to restrict contraband device access where it is not cost-effective to install managed access systems.” Detection Innovation Group, which sells inmate-tracking technology to prisons and jails, also urged the FCC to allow jamming.

Telecom industry groups say that limiting the effect of jamming will be difficult or impossible. The harms identified over a decade ago “remain the same today, although their effects are magnified by the increased use of wireless devices for broadband,” said the Telecommunications Industry Association, a standards-development group. “If an RF jamming solution is deployed at a correctional facility, such deployment risks not only interfering with voice communications but disrupting vital broadband services as well within the facility itself as well as the surrounding community.”

Verizon told the FCC that the Communications Act “requires more restrictive use of jamming devices than the NPRM [Notice of Proposed Rulemaking] proposes.” The CTIA argued that jamming isn’t necessary because the wireless industry already offers Managed Access Systems (MAS) as “a safe and effective contraband interdiction ecosystem.”

A Managed Access System establishes “a private cellular network that captures communications (voice, text, data) on commercial wireless frequencies within a correctional facility, determines whether that exchange is coming from or going to a contraband device, and, if so, prevents those communications from connecting to the wireless provider’s network,” the CTIA said. “At the same time, MAS allows communications to and from approved devices to be transmitted without interruption, including 911 and public safety calls within the correctional facility.”

More opposition came from the Wi-Fi Alliance, a tech industry group that tests and certifies interoperability of Wi-Fi products. The FCC proposal failed to “address the potential impact of such jamming on lawfully operating Wi-Fi and other unlicensed devices,” the group told the FCC.

The FCC plan is not limited to jamming of phones on spectrum licensed for the exclusive use of wireless carriers. The FCC additionally sought comment on whether contraband devices operating on Wi-Fi airwaves and other unlicensed spectrum should be subject to jamming. That’s concerning to the Wi-Fi Alliance because Wi-Fi operates on unlicensed spectrum that is shared by many users.

“Accordingly, declaring that a jammer on unlicensed spectrum is permitted to disrupt the communications of another device also operating on unlicensed spectrum is contrary to the foundational principle of Part 15 [of FCC rules], under which all unauthorized devices must cooperate in the use of spectrum,” the group said. “Moreover, authorizing the use of jamming equipment in unlicensed spectrum pursuant to Part 15 would undermine decades of global spectrum policy, weaken trust in license-exempt technologies by providing no assurance that devices using those technologies will work, and set a dangerous precedent for the intentional misuse of unlicensed spectrum.”

Letting jammers interfere with Wi-Fi and other unlicensed devices would effectively turn the jammers into “a de facto licensed service, operating with primary status in bands that are designated for unlicensed use,” the Wi-Fi Alliance said. “To achieve that undesirable result, the Commission would be required to change the Table of Frequency Allocations and issue authorizations for operations on unlicensed spectrum (just as it contemplates for the use of cell phone spectrum in jamming devices). That outcome would upend the premise of Part 15 operations.”

The GPS Innovation Alliance, another industry group, warned that even if the FCC imposes strict limits on transmission power and out-of-band emissions, “jammer transmissions can have spillover effects on adjacent and nearby band operations. Only specialized, encrypted signals, and specialized receivers and devices designed to decrypt those signals, are jam-resistant, in contrast to how most commercial technologies work.”

Now that public comments are in, Carr has to decide whether to move ahead with the plan as originally written, scrap it entirely, or come up with a compromise that might address some of the concerns raised by opponents. The FCC’s NPRM suggests a pilot program could be used to evaluate interference risks before a broader rollout, and the pilot idea received some support from carriers in their comments. A final proposal would be put to a vote of commissioners at the Republican-majority FCC.</div>

            <h2>Dell’s XPS revival is a welcome reprieve from the “AI PC” fad</h2>
            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-01-06</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2026/01/dells-xps-revival-is-a-welcome-reprieve-from-the-ai-pc-fad/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">After making the obviously poor decision to kill its XPS laptops and desktops in January 2025, Dell started selling 16- and 14-inch XPS laptops again today.

“It was obvious we needed to change,” Jeff Clarke, vice chairman and COO at Dell Technologies, said at a press event in New York City previewing Dell’s CES 2026 announcements.

A year ago, Dell abandoned XPS branding, as well as its Latitude, Inspiron, and Precision PC lineups. The company replaced the reputable brands with Dell Premium, Dell Pro, and Dell Pro Max. Each series included a base model, as well as “Plus” and “Premium.” Dell isn’t resurrecting its Latitude, Inspiron, or Precision series, and it will still sell “Dell Pro” models.

The revival of XPS means the return of one of the easiest recommendations for consumer ultralight laptops. Before last year’s shunning, XPS laptops had a reputation for thin, lightweight designs with modern features and decent performance for the price. This year, Dell is even doing away with some of the design tweaks that it introduced to the XPS lineup in 2022, which, unfortunately, were shoppers’ sole option last year.

Inheriting traits from the XPS 13 Plus introduced in 2022, the XPS-equivalent laptops that Dell released in 2025 had a capacitive-touch row without physical buttons, a borderless touchpad with haptic feedback, and a flat, lattice-free keyboard. The design was meant to enable more thermal headroom but made using the computers feel uncomfortable and unfamiliar.

The XPS 14 and XPS 16 laptops launching today have physical function rows. They still have a haptic touchpad, but now the touchpad has comforting left and right borders. And although the XPS 14 and XPS 16 have the same lattice-free keyboard of the XPS 13 Plus, Dell will release a cheaper XPS 13 later this year with a more traditional chiclet keyboard, since those types of keyboards are cheaper to make.

Dell’s about-face comes amid ongoing declines in its consumer PC revenue and global PC market share. It also represents a divergence in Dell’s messaging to computer shoppers.

Last year, Dell, as well as many other computer makers, committed to convincing people that they not only needed to buy a new computer but also a new “AI PC.” Corporate desire to leverage newly mainstream interest in AI to push PC sales was part of the reason Dell made new brand names for its 2025 computers.

“The AI PC market is quickly evolving,” Kevin Terwilliger, VP and GM of commercial, consumer, and gaming PCs at Dell, told reporters last year when announcing the new branding. “(E)veryone from IT decision makers to professionals and everyday users are looking at on-device AI to help drive productivity and creativity. To make finding the right AI PC easy for customers, we’ve introduced three simple product categories to focus on core customer needs,” he said.

But this week, as Dell unveils its ultralight laptop lineup, AI is taking a backseat.

“We’re getting back to our roots with a renewed focus on consumer and gaming,” Clarke said in a statement accompanying Dell’s announcement today.

The website for the new XPS laptops makes an obligatory nod to Microsoft’s Copilot+ PC program but is primarily focused on the computers’ thin build, low weight, battery life, and display. It seems Dell has accepted that these are the things that the average person cares about in their primary laptop, not the computer’s ability to run AI locally.

The XPS 14 launched today starting at $2,049, and the XPS 16 launched with a starting price of $2,200. A Dell spokesperson told Ars Technica that Dell will release additional configurations in February that are “well under $2,000.” Dell hasn’t shared final specs, pricing, or a release date for the 2026 XPS 13.</div>

            <h2>CIA Will Neither Confirm Nor Deny Records on 3I/ATLAS</h2>
            <p><strong>Futurism | 2026-01-07</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://futurism.com/space/cia-neither-confirm-deny-records-3i-atlas">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Ever since it was first spotted hurtling through the solar system, Harvard astronomer Avi Loeb has maintained that there’s a chance mysterious interstellar object 3I/ATLAS is a technological object sent by an extraterrestrial civilization.

He’s meticulously catalogued what he claims are anomalous qualities of the object, which most of his peers believe is a natural comet from a different star system, from its unusually large suspected size to a rotation axis almost perfectly perpendicular to the Sun to a “fine-tuned” trajectory that brought it within spitting distance of Mars and Jupiter.

Loeb has also been angered at NASA’s continued insistence that 3I/ATLAS is a natural comet — which, again, is the opinion of most experts — accusing them of “arrogance” and ignoring his documented anomalies. He also accused NASA of withholding observations by its Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter while 3I/ATLAS made its closest approach to the Red Planet in October, due to last year’s government shutdown. (The images were eventually released in late November.)

NASA isn’t the government institution that Loeb is taking aim at. In a new blog post, the astronomer pointed out that ufologist John Greenewald Jr.’s Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) inquiry for “any assessments, reports, or communications maintained by the Central Intelligence Agency referencing 3I/ATLAS” had been pointedly shut down.

The CIA told Greenewald in a formal response to his FOIA that it will “neither confirm nor deny the existence or nonexistence of records” related to the object — a non-answer that could be interpreted in strikingly different ways.

Greenewald is a well-known name in UFO circles. He founded The Black Vault, an enormous archive of millions of pages of government documents he’s uncovered via FOIA inquiries, including declassified videos of what the Pentagon describes as unidentified anomalous phenomena.

Loeb says he found the answer — and the notable level of secrecy — “surprising,” given NASA’s conclusion that “3I/ATLAS is definitely a comet of natural origin.”

“If this conclusion was clear all along to everyone within government and academia — as NASA officials presented the case, then why would the CIA treat the possible existence of records dealing with a natural comet as sensitive enough to be classified?” he asked rhetorically.

Loeb suggested the government might have investigated whether 3I/ATLAS could pose a threat to national security, perhaps over the possibility of a “black swan event,” which has fascinated the researcher.

If scientists do eventually uncover a probe sent to us by an alien civilization, it could pose a major threat to humanity, Loeb has asserted. He has previously hypothesized that the object could be “akin to a Trojan Horse, where a technological object masquerades as a natural comet.”

Discussions about such a possibility may have been “hidden from public view in order to prevent panic from taking hold for no good reason,” Loeb pondered, especially considering a “black swan event is still regarded as highly unlikely.”

However, this theory presupposes that the CIA even has anything to hide from the public to begin with. After all, in its statement to Greenewald, it didn’t rule out the “nonexistence of records.”

Besides, as more data rolls in, Loeb’s far-fetched theory that 3I/ATLAS is a piece of technology continues to be challenged.

In other words, what would there even to hide if the object does turn out to be a non-threatening lump of ice?

Either way, Loeb isn’t ready to call it just yet. He has advocated for taking a closer look once it makes its closest approach to Jupiter in March.

“Unless we check, we might never know if this swan is white or black,” he concluded in his blog.

            <div id="article-text">“Men do not make laws,” goes a maxim attributed to US president Calvin Coolidge. “They do but discover them.”

If that’s true, then the US attack on Venezuela just uncovered a legislative mother lode. A new law proposed by New York representative Ritchie Torres on Monday would make it illegal for government employees with access to nonpublic information from trading on prediction markets like Polymarket and Kalshi.

If that sounds like something that should probably already be illegal, Coolidge might agree, in his own laissez-faire way.

“Laws must be justified by something more than the will of the majority,” he concluded. “They must rest on the eternal foundation of righteousness.”

In any case, the “Public Integrity in Financial Prediction Markets Act of 2026,” would include new restrictions on elected officials, political appointees, and executive branch staffers, according to Forbes. It would also apply to government employees who have not yet been privy to nonpublic documents, but “may reasonably obtain such material nonpublic information in the course of performing official duties.”

The proposed legislation comes on the heels of compelling evidence that someone with inside information about the recent kidnapping of Venezuelan president Nicolás Maduro placed a series of large bets on Polymarket on whether an attack would take place. Just two days before the surprise attack, the account in question invested over $30,000 in a prediction that either Maduro would be “out” or that US troops would set foot “in Venezuela by” January 31st.

The payout was staggering: a profit of $400,000 in less than 24 hours, as sports entrepreneur Joe Pompliano estimated.

“Seems pretty suspicious!” Pompliano wrote. “Insider trading is not only allowed on prediction markets; it’s encouraged.”

Beyond the Venezuela attack, prediction markets have raised serious anxiety about geopolitical strife around the world. Recent advances in the sector have made it so that crypto bros can gamble on deadly conflicts in real-time, betting thousands of dollars on questions like “will Russia capture all of Kupiansk by March 31?”

Back in October, Reuters reported that the Trump Media and Technology Group was working with Crypto.com to implement prediction market functionality into Truth Social. That came as dozens of federal investigations into crypto-based price fixing, securities fraud, and regulatory noncompliance have been dropped at the Trump administration’s urging. Two of those cases were against prediction platforms Polymarket —the very same implicated in the Venezuela allegations — and Kalshi, for selling options contracts related to congressional elections.

Whether Torres’ new bill makes it very far remains to be seen. Recent history shows that Congress has little appetite for regulation of insider trading — and for now, there doesn’t yet seem to be a wager on the outcome of the bill on either Polymarket or Kalshi.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Grok, the flagship chatbot created by the Elon Musk-founded AI venture xAI and infused into X-formerly-Twitter — a platform also owned by Elon Musk — continues to be used by trollish misogynists, pedophiles, and other freaks of the digital gutters to non-consensually undress images of women and, even more horrifyingly, underage girls.

The women and girls targeted in these images range from celebrities and public figures to many non-famous private citizens who are often just average web users. As Futurism reported, some of the AI images generated by Grok and automatically published to X were specifically altered to depict real women in violent scenarios, including scenes of sexual abuse, humiliation, physical injury, kidnapping and insinuated murder.

Because Grok is integrated into X, this growing pile of nonconsensual and seemingly illegal images are automatically published directly to the social media platform — and thus are disseminated to the open web, in plain view, visible to pretty much anyone. As it stands, X and xAI have yet to take any meaningful action to stem the tide.

Below is a timeline of how this story has so far unfolded, and which we’ll continue to update as we follow whether X and xAI take action against this flood of harmful content.

A normal company, upon realizing that its platform-embedded AI chatbot was being used at scale to CSAM and unwanted deepfake porn of real people and spew it into the open web, would likely move quickly to disconnect the chatbot from its platform until a problem of such scale and severity could be resolved. But these days, X is not a normal company, and Grok is the same chatbot infamous for scandals including — but not limited to — calling itself “MechaHitler” and spouting antisemitic bile.

The story here isn’t just that Grok was doing this in the first place. It’s also that X, as a platform, appears to be a safe haven for the mass-generation of CSAM and nonconsensual sexual imagery of real women — content that has largely been treated by the losers creating this stuff like it’s all just one big meme. We’ll continue to follow whether X makes meaningful changes — or if it continues to choose inaction.

            <h2>Tesla Loses Trademark to “Cybercab” Due to Its Own Staggering Incompetence</h2>
            <p><strong>Futurism | 2026-01-06</strong></p>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">In a blunder that sums up Tesla’s struggling efforts in the self-driving space, Electrek reports that the Elon Musk-owned automaker has badly screwed up trying to get a trademark for its upcoming “Cybercab.”

The Cybercab, for the uninformed, is Tesla’s purpose-built vehicle for giving driverless rides. Right now, its capital-R Robotaxi service, which operates as a comically tiny fleet exclusively in Austin, Texas, uses existing Tesla Model Ys, not specialized cars (and its trademark is itself under peril due to yet more incompetence, as we’ll explain later.) A prototype of the two-passenger, no-steering wheel Cybercab was unveiled at Tesla’s “We, Robot” event over a year ago, and Musk claims it’ll enter production in Q2 this year.

That promise could still end up being fulfilled, if you’re to ignore Musk’s proclivity for making overblown statements. But in the meantime, the fabled Cybercab is in serious danger of losing its name.

According to a US Patent and Trademark Office suspension notice obtained by Electrek, the trademark “Cybercab” has been formally suspended as of November 14, 2025, for two main reasons: a “likelihood of confusion,” the USPTO’s examining attorney wrote, and because another company called Unibev, a French beverage outfit, beat Tesla to the punch.

This wasn’t down to bad luck. Per the reporting, Musk unveiled the Cybercab at the “We, Robot” event on October 10, 2024, but neglected to file an application until November — an astonishing oversight for a company so large and ambitious. Unibev, meanwhile, saw the opening and filed a “Cybercab” application before the end of the month. Tesla had weeks to secure its trademark, even after making the questionable decision of not filing for it before unveiling the new product at a highly covered event.

Unibev is using a tactic called trademark squatting, and it apparently has a vendetta with Tesla, having three trademarks for “TESLAQUILA” in the US, the same name Tesla tried to use for its own line of tequila, Electrek noted.

As we alluded to earlier, this isn’t the only branding blow Tesla has suffered for its self-driving cab efforts. Last summer, the USPTO turned down Tesla’s application for trademarking the term “Robotaxi” for being too generic. Or in the examiner’s words, “merely descriptive,” since the term robotaxi is “used to describe similar goods and services by other companies.” It may as well have tried to trademark its cars as Cars.

With the Cybercab blunder, Tesla has already tried and failed to change the USPTO’s mind, so it looks like it’ll have to cut a deal with Unibev to drop its claim, or argue in court that it can’t hold the trademark since it has no intent to build cars. An Electrek source familiar with the matter says that Tesla and Unibev are in negotiations, but with no agreement reached yet.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">If machines ever fight a war against humans, it’ll probably be fought with modern weapons of war — bullets, bombs, and perhaps plasma weapons a la “The Terminator” — in a conflict, the robots will presumably dominate against us sacks of flesh and blood. Heck, the AI could even just bioengineer a virus to wipe us out.

And even if the battlefield were somehow constrained to kicks and fists, we’re increasingly sure that humankind would catch an epic beatdown as humanoid robots show ever-greater advances in dexterity and martial arts acumen.

A new video shared by Chinese industry titan Unitree, for instance, shows off a new six-foot-tall H2 humanoid robot that’s capable of pulling off some seriously impressive moves. The lanky bot can be seen performing an impressive air kick while coming eerily close to the head of a human engineer standing nearby, destroying watermelons hung up above its head height with a mighty foot, and even sending two heavy punching bags spinning after delivering yet another powerful blow.

Unitree’s $30,000, 180cm (nearly 6 ft tall) H2 humanoid robot. This version is likely powered by an Nvidia Jetson AGX Thor platform, built on Blackwell architecture. pic.twitter.com/E3tTHUjRGw

In other words, if the fate of humanity were to be decided in the dojo via mixed martial arts, we’re not even sure humankind’s entire stable of UFC fighters could save us.

While Unitree’s latest demonstration of its H2 robot, a follow-up to its hugely popular and much shorter G1, is certainly impressive, it raises an interesting question. Why is the firm — and seemingly the vast majority of its competitors — so focused on martial arts? Just last month, Chinese company EngineAI posted a video of its CEO being kicked in the stomach by its perhaps appropriately-named T800 humanoid robote.

Whatever happened to far more useful applications for humanoid robotics, like cleaning the kitchen, doing laundry, or assisting the elderly?

Sure, H2 can spin on its own axis midair and turn a watermelon into pulp in one swift fusillade — but can it pick up a dirty sock off the ground?

Hell, if Unitree and its contemporaries are looking to impress us with their robots’ lethal prowess, why not attach some weapons to their extremities? Why go through the trouble of teaching them how to roundhouse kick?

Plenty of questions remain surrounding the viability of humanoid robots and their future role in society, despite billions of dollars being poured into their development. They may excel at pulling off pre-programmed martial arts moves, but the devil is in the details.

Manipulating objects and adjusting to the constantly changing conditions of the real world are proving far more challenging, further distancing us from a future in which humanoid robots are there to help us in our everyday lives, let alone become affordable enough for the average consumer.

And if they were to turn against us, they’d likely need to pick up a lot more skills than slick punches and kicks to wipe us off the planet for good.

Besides — as perfectly illustrated in a recent viral video that appears to show a man who’s remotely controlling a G1 humanoid robot to essentially kick himself in the nuts with the bot — chances are, humanity will have no problem defeating itself.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">While peering into some of the oldest regions of the known universe — dating back to just 1.4 billion years after the Big Bang — an international team of astronomers made a puzzling discovery.

As detailed in a paper published the journal Nature, they discovered an extremely hot galaxy cluster that’s far hotter and older than current theories allow.

In other words, the discovered cluster is, under our current best understanding of cosmology, impossible — which could upend our current understanding of how the early universe evolved.

“We didn’t expect to see such a hot cluster atmosphere so early in cosmic history,” said lead author and University of British Columbia PhD candidate Dazhi Zhou in a statement about the finding.

“In fact, at first I was skeptical about the signal as it was too strong to be real,” he added. “But after months of verification, we’ve confirmed this gas is at least five times hotter than predicted, and even hotter and more energetic than what we find in many present-day clusters.”

The astronomers’ best theory is that the cluster somehow got a massive head start — previously unimaginable even to top thinkers — thanks to black holes lurking at its core.

“This tells us that something in the early universe, likely three recently discovered supermassive black holes in the cluster, were already pumping huge amounts of energy into the surroundings and shaping the young cluster,” added coauthor and Dalhousie University professor Scott Chapman, “much earlier and more strongly than we thought.”

Conventional theories suggest that galaxy clusters gain energy as the gases inside are pulled together and squeezed due to intensifying gravitational forces. The latest research, however, suggests there’s more to how these clusters evolve — perhaps even a separate source beyond these gravitational forces.

The team found the strange readings when they analyzed observations by the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) in the Atacama desert in Chile that examined a “baby” galaxy cluster called SPT2349-56.

The cluster, which dates back to around 12 billion years, is huge: its core alone measures around half a million light-years across. That’s roughly the size of the halo that circles our own Milky Way galaxy, a vast region that contains globular clusters and older stars — yet it spawns stars more than 5,000 times faster.

The astronomers are hoping to figure out what allowed it to get so incredibly hot, a source of energy that defies our current models. The research suggests galaxy clusters evolve in a far more explosive manner than previously thought, aided by gravitational interactions between multiple supermassive black holes.

“We want to figure out how the intense star formation, the active black holes and this overheated atmosphere interact, and what it tells us about how present galaxy clusters were built,” Zhou explained in the statement. “How can all of this be happening at once in such a young, compact system?”

“Understanding galaxy clusters is the key to understanding the biggest galaxies in the universe,” Chapman said. “These massive galaxies mostly reside in clusters, and their evolution is heavily shaped by the very strong environment of the clusters as they form, including the intracluster medium.”

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Spotify is lowering its eligibility criteria for podcasters to monetize their videos on the platform, dropping the minimum episode requirement to three, minimum consumption hours to 2,000, and engaged audience member threshold to 1,000 over the last 30 days.

When the company introduced its partner program to monetize video content last year, creators needed to have published 12 episodes, hit 10,000 consumption hours over the prior 30 days, and had at least 2,000 people stream their content in the last 30 days to be part of the program.

The program pays podcasters according to the number of premium users who watched their videos on Spotify, alongside a share of ad revenue earned from users on the free tier.

The company is also introducing new sponsorship tools that would allow creators to update, schedule, and measure sponsorship spots read by hosts in video ads. These tools are coming to the Spotify for Creators app, and Megaphone, the company’s podcast hosting and monetization suite, in April.

Doubling down on its video strategy in a bid to compete better with YouTube, Spotify is now launching a new API that would let creators use their existing platforms to publish and monetize video podcasts on Spotify. At launch, tools like Acast, Audioboom, Libsyn, Omny, and Podigee have adopted this API, the company said.

The new moves come as Spotify’s been looking to new avenues to attract users and build on its streaming subscription revenue. The company said since the launch of the partner program, the consumption of video podcasts on the app has nearly doubled, and that the average Spotify podcast user streams twice as many video shows per month as they did before the program was launched.

But that could simply be a result of the streaming service surfacing more video content.

The company is also opening a studio for recording podcasts and videos in West Hollywood. Spotify said the studio would serve as a base for the Ringer podcast network, and it would open up the studio to select creators from the partner program. The company already has studios across the art district in LA, New York, Stockholm, and London.

            <p><strong>TechCrunch | 2026-01-07</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/07/roblox-now-requires-all-users-globally-to-complete-age-checks-to-access-chat/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Following a wave of lawsuits and investigations over child safety, Roblox has implemented mandatory facial verification for all users who want to access chats. The company is now rolling out the requirement globally after first testing it in a few markets last month.

To complete the age-check process, users have to open the Roblox app, allow access to their camera, and follow a series of on-screen instructions for facial verification. Once the age check is processed, Roblox says it will delete any images or videos of users. The verification is being processed by a third-party vendor, Persona, which also deletes images and videos after completing the process, Roblox says.

The company says users who are 13 and older can also choose to verify their age through ID verification instead of facial verification. Roblox notes that while age checks are optional, they’re required if users want to access communication features. In other words, you don’t have to verify your age to use Roblox, but you do need verification to use chat features.

If the age-check process incorrectly estimates a user’s age, they can appeal the decision and verify their age through alternative methods, including ID verification or through parental controls that allow parents to update their child’s age.

“Leveraging multiple signals, Roblox is constantly evaluating user behavior to determine if someone is significantly older or younger than expected,” the company wrote in a blog post. “In these situations, Roblox will soon ask users to repeat the age-check process.”

Once users complete an age check, they can access age-based chat, which means they can only communicate with others in a similar age group. There are six age groups: under 9, 9 to 12, 13 to 15, 16 to 17, 18 to 20, and 21 plus. Users in each age group can chat with people in the groups directly above and below theirs. For example, users in the 9-12 category can chat with users in their own group, as well as those in the under 9 and 13-15 groups.

Roblox says chat is disabled by default for children under 9 unless a parent provides consent following an age check.

The introduction of mandatory age checks comes amid multiple lawsuits, including from the attorneys general of Texas and Louisiana, against Roblox over child safety concerns. The lawsuits were filed following reports that Roblox was exposing young users to dangerous risks, such as grooming and explicit content.

Roblox has said the new age-check requirement will provide a more accurate way to verify users’ ages, compared with simply having users enter their birth year when creating an account.

            <div id="article-text">Articul8, an enterprise AI company spun out of Intel in early 2024, has secured more than half of a planned $70 million funding round at a $500 million pre-money valuation, according to its CEO, as it looks to capitalize on growing demand for AI systems in regulated industries.

The Series B funding round is structured in two installments, with the first led by Spain’s Adara Ventures, Articul8 founder and CEO Arun K. Subramaniyan (pictured above, center) said in an interview. He declined to disclose the size of the initial installment, but said the company expects to close the round in the first quarter of this year.

Articul8’s valuation for its current funding round marks a roughly fivefold increase from the company’s $100 million post-money Series A valuation in January 2024. Since then, the Santa Clara-based company said it has surpassed $90 million in total contract value — the cumulative value of all signed customer contracts — from 29 paying customers, including Hitachi Energy, AWS, Franklin Templeton, and Intel.

Subramaniyan told TechCrunch that Articul8 was not under pressure to raise capital, describing the company as revenue-positive following a series of large enterprise contracts.

The company expects to finish the year with annual recurring revenue of just over $57 million, Subramaniyan said, with roughly 45% to 50% of that already recognized.

Articul8 develops specialized AI systems that operate within customers’ own IT environments, rather than relying on shared, general-purpose models. Instead of selling standalone models, the company packages its technology as software applications and AI agents tailored to specific business functions, targeting regulated industries such as energy, manufacturing, aerospace, financial services, and semiconductors, where accuracy, auditability, and data control are critical.

“Our competition is pretty much everybody,” said Subramaniyan. “But today, the major competitors are the cloud service providers, because they have realized that their model, as the general-purpose [offerings], are all commodities.”

He added that Articul8’s focus on specialized systems appeals to customers who need predictable results and clear audit trails, something that is harder to achieve with general-purpose models run on shared cloud platforms.

Articul8 plans to use the Series B proceeds primarily to expand research and product development and to scale its operations internationally, with a focus on Europe and parts of Asia.

Adara Ventures’ participation will help speed-up the European expansion plan, as the European Investment Fund backs the Madrid-based VC firm’s energy fund, Subramaniyan said. The company is also looking to scale in markets including Japan and South Korea, where it has begun working with large enterprise customers, he noted.

India’s Aditya Birla Ventures also participated in the ongoing round, Subramaniyan stated.

Articul8 works with large tech groups including Nvidia and Google Cloud, Subramaniyan said, adding that Amazon Web Services is both a customer and a partner for the company on some deployments.

The company employs 75 people, with about 80% focused on R&D, and teams spread across the U.S., Brazil, and India.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">If there is one point of consensus among the CES 2026 keynote speakers, it is that AI is reshaping technology with a speed and scale unlike any previous technological revolution.

In a live taping on Tuesday of the All-In podcast, co-host Jason Calacanis interviewed Bob Sternfels, Global Managing Partner of McKinsey & Company, and Hemant Taneja, CEO of General Catalyst. Their discussion focused on how AI is transforming investment strategies and the workforce.

“The world has completely changed,” Taneja said about the unprecedented growth of AI companies. He noted that while it took Stripe about 12 years to reach a $100 billion valuation, Anthropic, another General Catalyst portfolio company, soared from a $60 billion valuation last year to a “couple hundred billion dollars” this year.

Taneja believes we are on the verge of seeing a new wave of trillion-dollar companies. “That’s not a pie-in-the-sky idea with Anthropic, OpenAI, and a couple of others,” he said.

Calacanis pressed them on what’s driving this explosive growth. According to McKinsey’s Sternfels, while many companies are testing AI products, non-tech enterprises remain on the fence about full adoption. Sternfels says the question that McKinsey consultants often hear from CEOs is: “Do I listen to my CFO or my CIO right now?”

CFOs, seeing little return on investment, argue for delaying implementation. Meanwhile, CIOs claim it’s “crazy” not to adopt AI because “we’ll be disrupted,” Sternfels said.

Another key concern is how AI is reshaping the labor force. “Some people are looking at AI and they’re scared,” Calacanis said, noting concerns that AI could replace entry-level jobs traditionally filled by recent graduates. He asked Sternfels and Taneja for advice on what young people should do in this new landscape.

Sternfels said that while AI models can handle many tasks, sound judgment and creativity remain the essential skills humans must bring to succeed in an AI-infused world.

Meanwhile, Taneja argued that people must recognize that “skilling and re-skilling” will be a lifelong endeavor. “This idea that we spend 22 years learning and then 40 years working is broken,” he said.

Calacanis agreed that in a world where it may take less time to build an AI agent than to train a new worker, people must find ways to stay relevant. “To stand out, you’re going to have to show chutzpah, drive, passion,” he said.

Sternfels provided a glimpse into that future. While he expects McKinsey to have as many “personalized” AI agents as employees by the end of 2026, he noted that headcount will not necessarily decrease. Instead, the firm is shifting its composition; it’s increasing employees who work directly with clients by 25% while reducing back-office roles by the same percentage.

            <p><strong>TechCrunch | 2026-01-07</strong></p>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Meta’s $2 billion acquisition of AI assistant platform Manus is unsurprisingly caught in a regulatory tug-of-war — but not because of U.S. regulators. They appear assured that the deal is legitimate despite earlier misgivings about Benchmark’s investment in Manus. China’s regulators, however, are reportedly not quite as sanguine, according to the Financial Times.

When Benchmark led a financing round for Manus earlier this year, the investment sparked immediate controversy. U.S. Senator John Cornyn complained about the deal on X, and the investment prompted inquiries from the U.S. Treasury Department around new rules restricting American investment in Chinese AI companies.

The concerns were significant enough to spur Manus’s eventual relocation from Beijing to Singapore — part of what drove the company’s “step-by-step disentanglement from China,” as one Chinese professor described it on WeChat this past weekend.

Now the tables have turned. Chinese officials are reportedly reviewing whether the Meta deal violates technology export controls, potentially giving Beijing leverage it wasn’t initially perceived as having. Specifically, they’re examining whether Manus needed an export license when it relocated its core team from China to Singapore — a move that’s apparently now so common it has earned the nickname “Singapore washing.” A recent Wall Street Journal article speculated that China has “few tools to influence the deal given Manus’s foothold in Singapore,” but that assessment may have been premature.

The concern in Beijing is that this deal could encourage more Chinese startups to physically relocate to dodge domestic oversight. Winston Ma, a professor at New York University School of Law and partner at Dragon Capital, told the Journal that if the deal closes smoothly, “It creates a new path for the young AI startups in China.”

History suggests Beijing could act. China previously used similar export control mechanisms to intervene in Trump’s attempted TikTok ban during his first term. The Chinese professor on WeChat even warned that Manus’ founders could face criminal liability if they exported restricted technology without authorization.

Meanwhile, some U.S. analysts are calling the acquisition a win for Washington’s investment restrictions, arguing it shows Chinese AI talent is defecting to the American ecosystem. One expert told the FT that the deal demonstrates “the US AI ecosystem is currently more attractive.”

It’s too early to know if this impacts Meta’s plans to integrate Manus’s AI agent software into its products, but this $2 billion deal may have gotten more complicated than anyone anticipated.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">CES 2026 is in full swing in Las Vegas, with the show floor open to the public after a packed couple of days occupied by press conferences from the likes of Nvidia, Sony, and AMD and previews from Sunday’s Unveiled event.

As has been the case for the past two years at CES, AI is at the forefront of many companies’ messaging, though the hardware upgrades and oddities that have long defined the annual event still have their place on the show floor and in adjacent announcements. We’ll be collecting the biggest reveals and surprises here, though you can still catch the spur-of-the-moment reactions and thoughts from our team on the ground via our live blog right here.

Let’s dive right in, starting with some of Monday’s biggest players.

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang delivered an expectedly lengthy presentation at CES, taking a victory lap for the company’s AI-driven successes, setting the stage for 2026, and yes, hanging out with some robots.

The Rubin computing architecture, which has been developed to meet the increasing computation demands that AI adoption creates, is set to begin replacing Blackwell architecture in the second half of this year. It comes with speed and storage upgrades, but our Senior AI Editor Russell Brandom goes into the nitty-gritty of what distinguishes Rubin.

And Nvidia continued its push to bring the AI revolution into the physical world, showcasing its Alpamayo family of open-source AI models and tools that will be used by autonomous vehicles this year. That approach, as Senior Reporter Rebecca Bellan notes, mirrors the company’s broader efforts to make its infrastructure the Android for generalist robots.

AMD Chair and CEO Lisa Su delivered the first keynote of CES, with a presentation that featured partners including OpenAI President Greg Brockman, AI legend Fei-Fei Lei, Luma AI CEO Amit Jain, and more.

Beyond the partner showcases, Senior Reporter Rebecca Szkutak detailed AMD’s approach toward expanding the reach of AI through personal computers using its Ryzen AI 400 Series processors.

Hyundai’s press conference focused on its robotics partnerships with Boston Dynamics, but the companies revealed that they’re working with Google’s AI research lab rather than competitors to train and operate existing Atlas robots, as well as a new iteration of Atlas that was shown on stage. Transportation Editor Kirsten Korosec has the full rundown.

Amazon’s AI-centric update with Alexa+ is getting the kind of push you’d expect at CES, with the company launching Alexa.com for Early Access customers looking to use the chatbot via its browsers, along with a similar, revamped bot-focused app. Consumer Editor Sarah Perez has the details, along with news on Amazon’s revamp to Fire TV and new Artline TVs, which have their own Alexa+ push.

On the Ring front, Consumer Reporter Ivan Mehta runs through the many announcements, from fire alerts to an app store for third-party camera integration, and more.

In the past, Razer has been all about ridiculous hardware at CES, from three-screen laptops to haptic gaming cushions and a mask that landed the company a federal fine. This year, its two attention-grabbing announcements were for Project Motoko, which aims to function similarly to smart glasses, but without the glasses.

Then there’s Project AVA, which puts the avatar of an AI companion on your desk. We’ll let you watch the concept video for yourself.

Lego joined CES for the first time to hold a behind-closed-doors showcase of its Smart Play System, which includes bricks, tiles and Minifigures that can all interact with each other and play sounds, with the debut sets both having a Star Wars theme. Senior Writer Amanda Silberling has all the details here.

            <h2>How Many Sea Lions Must Die?</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-01-07</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/2026/01/sea-lion-salmon-euthanasia-columbia-river/685523/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Of all the schemes that humans have devised to keep sea lions from gorging on the salmon of the Columbia River basin, none has worked for long. Local officials and researchers have chased sea lions with boats and peppered them with rubber bullets; they’ve detonated noisy explosives. They’ve outfitted the docks where the animals like to rest with uncomfortable spinners, electrified mats, flailing tube men, and motion-activated sprinklers. (“Very surprisingly, they don’t like to get wet on land,” Casey Clark, a marine-mammal biologist at the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife, told me.) At one point, the Port of Astoria dispatched a 32-foot fiberglass replica of sea lions’ primary predator, the orca, outfitted with real orca sounds, that almost immediately capsized. Scientists have captured sea lions and released them thousands of miles away, as far as Southern California. No matter the tactic, the result is largely the same: Within weeks, or sometimes even hours, the sea lions swim right back.

The waterways of the Columbia River basin, full of dams that corral salmon in tight spaces, are just too easy of a hunting ground for the sea lions to spurn. In especially hard-hit sections of the Columbia River, sea lions have eaten close to half of the spring Chinook run. “That’s a devastating amount of fish,” Jeremy Cram, the salmon-recovery coordinator at the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife, told me—both for the region’s highly vulnerable fish and for the humans who want to catch and eat them.

So in recent years, officials made sea-lion removals more permanent, which is to say, more deadly. Since 2020, the states of Washington, Oregon, and Idaho, as well as a handful of local tribes, have trapped and euthanized more than 200 sea lions in and around the Columbia River—and have still fallen short of the limits allowed by federal law. With sea lions still eating thousands of salmon each spring at sites such as the Bonneville Dam, near Portland, some local fishers, tribal members, and politicians are pushing for the mammals’ body count to rise. “Ask yourself: Why? Why are these numbers so small?” Marie Gluesenkamp Perez, who represents Washington’s Third Congressional District, said at a hearing about the sea lions last month.

Not everyone agrees that more kills are needed. But at this point, all else has failed. To preserve the region’s salmon, more sea lions must go.

Sea lions have never been salmon’s primary threat: That honor belongs to us. More than a century of overfishing, industrialization, and hatchery mismanagement has brought several populations of salmon and their close relative the steelhead to critically low levels in the Pacific Northwest. To spawn, salmon must swim hundreds or even thousands of miles upstream from the ocean, and in the Columbia River and its many tributaries, their path is obstructed by a massive network of hydroelectric dams. Ladders can help fish circumvent these obstacles, but learning to navigate them can take the animals days. In a highly built world, salmon have a far harder time reproducing and surviving than they used to have.

Over the past 40 years, the United States has poured $9 billion into reversing the basin’s salmon and steelhead declines and currently spends more on those efforts than on any other endangered animal in the country. But efforts to mitigate human harms—restricting harvests, remodeling dams, breeding salmon in hatcheries—are yielding diminishing returns. Climate change has made habitat-restoration efforts more challenging, as have pollution from pesticides and even toxic tire dust. Conservationists aim to restore the annual number of returning adult salmon and steelhead to 5 million, but the population, on average, has been stagnant at around 2 million for decades.

Rehabilitating a river can take years to produce an effect, but cull a few sea lions from a dam, “and there’s a benefit the next day,” Clark said. In 2017, winter steelhead populations at Oregon’s Willamette Falls seemed almost certain to soon go extinct, Michael Brown, the marine-mammal program leader at the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife, told me. But after agency officials euthanized 33 adult male sea lions at the falls, the number of steelhead reaching their destination went from hundreds to thousands.

Read: In one place, for one fish, climate change may be a boon

Plus, killing a handful of sea lions can steer many more away from a site. In the same way that they quickly deduce that tube men can’t hurt them (in fact, some animals end up simply cuddling the warm fans that power them), sea lions notice when their peers venture upstream and fail to come back. After the lethal removals at Willamette Falls and the Bonneville Dam began, far fewer sea lions returned to the sites than the number that researchers expected. Nathan Pamplin, the director of external affairs at the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife, told me the department estimates that sea-lion removal costs $203 for each fish saved—pricey, but no more expensive than other salmon-recovery efforts.

Still, the process of lethal removal is cumbersome. Under the 1972 Marine Mammal Protection Act, sea lions must be euthanized by a trained professional—a process that requires trapping the animals, which can weigh up to 2,000 pounds, then herding them onto a barge for transfer to a nearby facility. Robert DeLong, a former National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration researcher who has studied sea lions for decades, told me that removal teams, which must activate the traps manually, could at first snare the animals during daylight hours. But some sea lions began sneaking out before the sun rose, requiring teams to entrap and handle them under low-light conditions—“a human-safety issue,” he said. A crew of about eight people, working from around 4:30 a.m. until the early afternoon, might be able to trap, kill, and necropsy just two to five sea lions in this manner, Doug Hatch, a fisheries scientist at the Columbia River Inter-Tribal Fish Commission, told me.

Gluesenkamp Perez told me she thinks the sea-lion-removal process should be simpler. Her preferred alternative is firearms—“engaging with these animals as animals, and not treating it like a petting zoo,” she said. Currently, shooting sea lions is illegal, but that hasn’t stopped locals from trying. Of the many sea-lion corpses that DeLong has necropsied for research, “the majority of those animals have pieces of buckshot or bird shot or rifle slugs in their musculature,” he told me. In the mid-aughts, Hatch said, firearms were quickly dismissed as a removal method at the Bonneville Dam because using them would have meant shutting down the interstate highway that runs past the dam, as well as clearing people out of the site, which is open to the public. But some tribes in the Pacific Northwest have been discussing using firearms to harvest sea lions and other pinnipeds for subsistence, as Alaskan Natives do, Cecilia Gobin, a conservation-policy analyst at the Northwest Indian Fisheries Commission, told me. Ultimately, Gobin argues, like Gluesenkamp Perez does, “If we are going to take these animals, the most humane way seems to be not to trap them, remove them to some off-site location, and euthanize them, but to have more of a targeted kill.”

Before the Marine Mammal Protection Act passed, in 1972, sea lions were in trouble, too. Years of overfishing had depleted their prey, and humans killed them for sustenance or in disputes over fish. But over the past half century, many local populations have rebounded, in large part by chasing their favorite foods inland.

The fact that sea lions are faring better than salmon has made it easier for humans to side with the fish. But regardless, salmon seem to hold more intrinsic value to us. In the state of Washington alone, the annual salmon harvest is worth roughly $14 million. Many Pacific Northwest tribes have subsisted on the fish for millennia and have woven them into their religions and languages. The right to harvest fish is enshrined in their treaties, but “there’s no way that somebody can sustain themselves as a fisher anymore,” Aja DeCoteau, the executive director of the Columbia River Inter-Tribal Fish Commission, told me. Some tribes in the region that traditionally hold First Salmon feasts to welcome the arrival of spring salmon from the ocean have waited for their catch in vain, forcing them to ask other tribes to donate a fish, Gobin said.

Sea lions are also ecologically essential, but not as much as salmon are. Researchers estimate that roughly 140 other species depend on salmon for food; among them are the Pacific Northwest’s critically endangered southern resident orcas—making sea-lion removals “management of a protected species to benefit a protected species, which may then benefit a protected species,” Clark told me.

From the July 1946 issue: The salmon rise

By law, the number of sea lions that can be lethally removed from the Columbia River basin is far below the number that researchers think would impede the animals’ recovery. But some scientists are hesitant to scale up to even those allowable levels. Although sea lions do appear to be measurably depleting salmon at some sites, including the Bonneville Dam and Willamette Falls, the evidence is shakier elsewhere in the region. Plus, removing sea lions from this delicate system may simply allow another predator to swoop in, including the many birds and other fish that also prey on salmon working their way through ladders. Alejandro Acevedo-Gutiérrez, a biologist at Western Washington University, told me he worries that pinnipeds have become an inadvertent scapegoat for salmon’s larger issues, simply because sea-lion-on-salmon predation events—loud, violent affairs in which the mammal beats the fish on the surface of the water, then noisily gnaws its flesh—are more visible than the effects of climate change.

Perhaps the sea lions’ greatest crime is indulging in salmon that humans would rather be feasting on. “We invested so much into all of this,” John North, the deputy fish-division administrator at the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife, told me. Decades of work and billions of dollars deep into salmon recovery, humans cannot allow the fish’s comeback to fall apart just because hungry sea lions have swum too far upstream. But salmon protection has never been only about keeping the fish safe. If salmon levels rebound, we can and will eat more of them, Cram said: “The real predator that those fish would go to is us.”</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">I remember exactly where I was standing when I was considering a familiar but newly significant question in the aisles of Santa Monica’s Angel City Books & Records in late January. I was holding a slender, charmingly illustrated volume from 1938 called Carmen: The Story of Bizet’s Opera. Should I buy it or leave it behind?

I had weighed that exact yes-or-no question untold thousands of times across my 60-some years of book collecting. This time was different. Weeks earlier, excepting a few hastily grabbed items, my entire collection of something like 4,000 volumes, acquired one by one over all those decades, had turned to smoke and ash in the Palisades fire. The question before me was not just about this particular book, but about whether it made sense, in my late 70s, to begin collecting all over again.

I’d owned so many books in so many collecting areas that no one but me knew the extent of what I’d had, and even I’d forget the specifics from time to time. My film-book collection, no surprise given my nearly 30-year stint as a Los Angeles Times film critic, covered an entire wall. But I also had shelves upon shelves of hard-boiled crime fiction, including an impeccably jacketed first edition of James M. Cain’s The Postman Always Rings Twice. I had many shelves more of Yiddish literature in translation, with an emphasis on Isaac Bashevis Singer, who’d personally signed a copy of his Nobel Prize speech to me.

There were also hundreds of Grosset & Dunlap’s Photoplay editions, books about the history of Montana (my wife’s home state), and the many volumes I’d bought while researching my joint biography of MGM titans Louis B. Mayer and Irving Thalberg. Then there were the one-off books I’d gotten because they had spoken to me. A first edition of George Eliot’s philo-Semitic Daniel Deronda; a colorful jacketed first of Zane Grey’s Rogue River Feud, bought to celebrate a family boat trip; a book on avian diseases by Robert Stroud, the “Birdman of Alcatraz.” All of it gone, suddenly, overnight. Book blogs mourned my loss, a distinction that was both affirming and heartrending.

Read: The house where 28,000 records burned

My books had almost defined me, providing comfort and order in a chaotic world. Almost a year on, I find myself fantasizing that my collection still exists in another dimension, like a book heaven, intact but eternally out of reach.

Perhaps the fire had been a sign, the universe trying to teach me about the impermanence of objects and the futility of collecting. Maybe the virtuous minimalists who mocked possessions were right. I’d read stories of people using the fire as an opportunity to start over. One couple we knew found in their loss a chance to live in central Paris—where, Notre Dame notwithstanding, the potential for a catastrophic fire was close to nil.

My wife and I were planning to stay in West Los Angeles, which made the prospect of collecting again feel like rebuilding a house in a floodplain. I was also a lot older than my late friend Ricky Jay had been when, at 45, he began a new collection of magic-related memorabilia after he lost an earlier one. Regardless of how much time I had, I knew I would never be able to replace the many one-of-a-kind items I had so lovingly amassed, such as a gorgeous Soviet first of Isaac Babel’s Red Cavalry in a custom clamshell case.

All of this and more went through my head in that should-I-or-shouldn’t-I moment in the Santa Monica bookstore.

The book in question was not particularly rare or noteworthy, but something about it appealed to me. Finally, I listened to my emotions: I wanted it, I could afford it, so I went ahead and bought it. I’d deal with those larger questions later.

But I didn’t ponder; I didn’t reckon; I simply kept buying. On a long-planned trip to New Zealand a couple of months later, I skipped trekking and camping and took in the country’s exemplary used-book stores instead. I found a Bashevis Singer book that had started its journey in a Singapore bookstore, or so the imprint on its elaborate plastic dust jacket claimed. I replaced some of my incinerated Anthony Trollopes with an Everyman’s Library set of his beloved Chronicles of Barsetshire—though the cost of shipping these six volumes home made the frugal Wellington dealer blanch.

One of my oldest friends, an artist in Greece who collects inexpensive paperbacks with vivid covers, parted with “the prize” of his own collection—a beautiful Penguin edition of Cain’s Serenade—to help me along with mine. He wrote that he hoped that the book would serve as “a kind of ‘talisman’” for me, “carrying with it all the best into the future.” A friend in Los Angeles returned the copy of Babel’s Benia Krik: A Film-Novel that I had given him years earlier. Dealers I knew offered discounts, subsidies, even books for free. In December, a box of books arrived unexpectedly from our legendary Montana landscaper and tree specialist, who’d heard about our loss and wanted to “help build back” our library.

These touching gestures reminded me that books were restorative, bringers of joy as well as knowledge. They recalled a talk I once gave to book collectors at UCLA, in which I invoked the Jewish concept of tikkun olam, the restoration of a shattered world. Though book collecting is often a solitary activity, I came to see that gathering so many voices and far-flung volumes into a unified collection is “a way to heal the world one book at a time.”

Gifts from friends and colleagues also forced more practical considerations about what I actually wanted for this new collection, and where I would put it. Among the first pieces of furniture we got for our new rental home were sizable bookcases. Yet they are still modest compared with what I was used to, and I didn’t want to fill them up too quickly. My previous collecting goals had been encyclopedic, but this “the more the merrier” aesthetic would now be impractical, for reasons of both space and time.

Casting about for inspiration about a sustaining collecting path, I remembered an impulse purchase made just after returning from New Zealand: The Miniature Library of Queen Mary’s Dolls’ House, a book that describes everything you ever wanted to know about the nearly 600 miniature books, none taller than a few centimeters in the renowned dollhouse created in the 1920s for the wife of King George V. This tiny library, which had gardening books, the complete works of Shakespeare, and some 200 handwritten volumes by the likes of Thomas Hardy and Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, was not meant to be comprehensive. It was meant to “reflect the literary landscape of the time.”

Though no one is handwriting any books for me, tiny or otherwise, this dollhouse library helped me see how to proceed. My new collection would be spare and potent, a miniature version of my former enormity.

Read: ‘I’ve never seen anything like this’

I turned to stalwart websites such as Bookfinder to locate works that had been particularly painful to lose, including Abraham Joshua Heschel’s magisterial The Sabbath and Alfred Kazin’s memory piece A Walker in the City. I replaced old friends and made new ones. My miniature Montana collection, which fits snugly on a single shelf, mixes beloved classics such as The Last Best Place anthology with newfound gems, including Copper Camp: Lusty Story of the Richest Hill on Earth, a colorful 1943 history of the booming mining town of Butte.

If a shelf becomes too tight, I feel more comfortable culling now than I ever had been before the fire. There turned out to be something satisfying about the discipline involved in creating a personally meaningful collection within these constraints.

The damage of loss, of course, is not so easily overcome. Whenever I see a photograph in a newspaper or magazine of someone else’s still-intact library, I wince and have to turn the page, and it will be that way for a while. But when I enter my office and experience my new collection, admiring the trimness and focus of what I’ve done, I feel something like the calm I felt before.

The fire did not release me to become someone else. It did not liberate me from my past so that I could try on a new kind of life. Instead, it helped me see what it is about my life and myself that I very much want to keep, regardless of the circumstances. And it turns out that managing to stay myself amid the chaos of the past year was more of an accomplishment than I’d realized. Maybe not miraculous, but something of value nevertheless.</div>

            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-01-07</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/2026/01/mark-kelly-trump-pentagon/685521/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Mark Kelly will probably be fine. The senator and Navy veteran isn’t likely to be cowed by Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth’s lawless attempt to silence him by seeking to demote him post-retirement.

“It’s dead on arrival,” Gene Fidell, an expert on the Uniform Code of Military Justice who teaches at Yale Law, told me. “If this ever gets in front of a judge, the judge is going to say, ‘Fuck you.’”

The attack on Kelly may have a much broader aim, which is to silence other service members who might speak out about the Trump administration’s actions by threatening their financial well-being. Veterans who lack Kelly’s platform, influence, and social connections may feel that their pension isn’t worth the risk of saying something critical of the president.

In a post on X, Hegseth announced that Kelly was being demoted for a video from November. He and five other Democratic lawmakers who had been service members or intelligence officers reiterated the principle that members of the military do not have to follow unlawful orders. This is a banal statement of law, one that Hegseth himself has made publicly in years past. And Kelly had good reason to warn against abuses of military power. Donald Trump, after all, has deployed federal agents and military units to American cities—apparently as a kind of punishment for being liberal—and openly speculated about using “some of these dangerous cities as training grounds for our military.”

The time may come when service members are commanded to murder fellow citizens on the president’s orders, and they should know that they can refuse to do so. One wonders whether that is precisely why the Trump administration’s response has been so heavy-handed: Trump officials don’t want service members hearing that they do not have to follow unlawful orders, because they may someday issue them.

Nothing in Kelly’s video was grounds for punishment under the Uniform Code of Military Justice, which forbids service members and retirees from using “contemptuous” language in reference to the president and some other officials, and from engaging in conduct prejudicial to “good order and discipline.” In a statement, Kelly said that Hegseth and Trump “don’t get to decide what Americans in this country get to say about their government.” Trump, however, had declared that the video was “punishable by DEATH.”

There are clearly good reasons for the code to enforce standards of conduct. When you serve for 20 years in the military, you retire with a pension defined by your rank. Officers can be demoted after the fact, on the basis of behavior that occurred while in uniform. In 2021, for instance, an Army major general was demoted for sexual abuse that occurred while he was on active duty, despite having retired in 2005.

But Kelly’s statements were not made while on active duty, and were not disparaging. “There’s nothing improper, much less criminal, in what they said,” Fidell said. “It’s not conduct unbecoming; it is not seditious.”

“His exact words were merely a statement of the law, which is: You can disobey unlawful orders. That’s factually, legally correct,” Brenner Fissell, a law professor at Villanova and a vice president at the National Institute of Military Justice, told me. “How can it be a criminal offense to state the law?”

It’s not—in a democracy. But Trump and his enablers act as if they’re above the law, and seem to feel entitled to punish anyone who displeases them. As the Trump adviser Stephen Miller put it in an interview with CNN’s Jake Tapper about the arrest of the Venezuelan president, “We live in a world, in the real world, Jake, that is governed by strength, that is governed by force, that is governed by power.” He called these forces “the iron laws of the world since the beginning of time.” Miller’s tedious attempts to sound like a comic-book supervillain aside, this may be the way most states have been governed, but it is also a description of the kind of tyranny the Constitution was written to prevent.

It is strange that military law continues to govern the political speech of retired service members. This is, in my view, a clearly unconstitutional quirk that Hegseth is exploiting to punish Kelly and silence others—including, potentially, other lawmakers with military backgrounds who might speak out against Trump policies.

“One of the things that I’m hoping to do is spread a little truth on the water here, so that people aren’t chilled,” Fidell said. Veterans “have as much right as you or I do to speak their minds.”

A simple solution to prevent this abuse of authority would be for Congress to change the law so that military retirees are not subject to restrictions on speech or conduct that takes place after they no longer serve in uniform. “Retiree jurisdiction does not need to exist; it’s irrational,” Fissell said. “You’ve got 99-year-old World War II veterans who are still subject to military law.”

The much broader problem, however, is that the American people elected a president who thinks it should be illegal to criticize him, illegal to oppose him, and illegal to remind others that they have the right to do so. The other Democratic lawmakers in the video aren’t drawing military pensions, so are not subject to the military code of justice. Nevertheless, the administration found a way to punish them by subjecting them to an FBI investigation—it’s unclear for what, because contempt of Trump is not a crime under American law.

When criticizing the leader becomes a crime, being a criminal becomes an obligation.</div>

            <h2>A Trump Loyalist on the Verge of Immense Economic Power</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-01-07</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/economy/2026/01/kevin-hassett-trump-federal-reserve/685522/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">With the possible exception of the president, no person has more sway over the fortunes of the United States economy than the chair of the Federal Reserve. Because the Fed controls the U.S. money supply, sets interest rates, regulates banks, and provides liquidity in an emergency, the chair’s decisions help determine the pace of inflation, the strength of the labor market, the stability of the financial system, and the cost of a mortgage. If the country faces an economic crisis, the chair’s job is to get us out of it.

Soon, this all-important position might be held by Kevin Hassett, the current director of Donald Trump’s National Economic Council. No doubt, Hassett is a Trump loyalist. And there’s reason to fear that, as chair, he will do Trump’s bidding, undermining the central bank’s independence and marking a new stage in the president’s control over the American economy.

When Trump nominated Hassett to chair his first-term Council of Economic Advisors, in 2017, the Washington economics establishment was delighted. A bipartisan group of influential economists, including top advisers for former Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama as well as two former chairs of the Federal Reserve, wrote a letter urging the Senate to confirm him. As evidence of Hassett’s qualifications, the letter cited his “record of serious scholarship on a wide range of topics”; his stellar résumé, which included stints at the Federal Reserve and Treasury Department; and his efforts to “reach out to a wide range of people from across the ideological spectrum.”

Hassett is now the front-runner to succeed Jerome Powell as Fed chair when Powell’s term ends in May, and some of the experts who endorsed Hassett for the CEA are similarly pleased about the prospect of him overseeing the central bank. “I think he’d be a good Fed chair,” Mark Zandi, the chief economist at Moody’s Analytics, who has known Hassett for more than a decade and signed the 2017 letter, told me. “He’s smart, curious, willing to debate, and has a good working relationship with the president. Those are the qualities you need for this job.”

A close examination of Hassett’s record, alongside conversations with nearly a dozen of his former peers and colleagues, however, suggests that what was true about him in 2017 might not be true today. Over the past decade, Hassett has become an unapologetic Trump propagandist in ways that the phrase good working relationship doesn’t quite capture. In his years working for Trump, Hassett has proved willing to change his beliefs, misrepresent basic facts, and endorse dangerous conspiracy theories, all in an apparent effort to please the president. His obsequiousness probably explains why he is now on the verge of running the Fed, and introduces the possibility of a central bank willing to uncritically carry out the president’s wishes, economic consequences be damned.

Before his MAGA career, Hassett, who didn’t respond to multiple interview requests, spent several decades as a respected conservative economist. He received his Ph.D. in economics from the University of Pennsylvania in 1990, before going to work as an economics professor at Columbia Business School, a researcher at the Federal Reserve, and, in 1997, a resident scholar (and later director of economic-policy studies) at the American Enterprise Institute. At the time, AEI was the preeminent conservative think tank in Washington. Over the next two decades, Hassett wrote op-eds for The New York Times, The Washington Post, and The Wall Street Journal; appeared frequently on cable news; and advised the Republicans George W. Bush, John McCain, and Mitt Romney on their presidential runs.

Like most conservative economists at the time, Hassett was a staunch deficit hawk, an advocate of higher levels of immigration, and, above all else, an unabashed free trader. During the Bush and Obama years, he called for major deficit reductions, defended the global trade system, and proposed that the U.S. double its intake of immigrants to boost GDP growth. In 2011, when Trump was floating a run for the presidency, Hassett wrote an op-ed eviscerating his proposal for a 25 percent tariff on all imports from China. “He appears to still have a tin ear on tax policy,” Hassett wrote of Trump, whose plan, he argued, “would be terrifyingly similar to the Smoot-Hawley tariffs that set off a trade war in 1930, and helped turn the stock market crash of 1929 into the Great Depression.”

The pre-MAGA version of Hassett had his share of questionable judgment calls. In September 1999, just months before the dot-com crash, he co-authored a book predicting that the Dow Jones would quadruple over the next three to five years. (This did not occur until 2021.) In November 2010, with unemployment at nearly 10 percent and the economy still in the throes of a recession, Hassett signed an open letter warning that the Fed’s efforts to boost the economy could trigger hyperinflation. The Fed ignored the letter, and inflation remained near or below 2 percent for the next decade.

Still, Hassett maintained a solid reputation among Washington insiders. Several of the signatories of the 2017 letter told me they believed that Hassett would be an adult in the room who would help prevent Trump from acting on his most dangerous impulses. (Much of the MAGA right opposed Hassett’s nomination for the same reason.) During the first two years of Trump’s presidency, this proved to be true. Although Hassett often defended the president’s decisions publicly, he was known to privately argue for a more conventional approach on issues such as immigration and trade. He was even willing to suggest that Trump was not omnipotent. When asked in a 2019 interview whether he supported Trump’s demand that the Fed slash interest rates, Hassett responded, “It’s not my job at CEA to give the Fed advice. My job at CEA is to remind people to respect the independence of the Fed.”

Then, in June 2019, Trump somewhat abruptly announced Hassett’s departure. The president’s first-term trade war with China was heating up and his spat with Powell was intensifying. Just a week before, Hassett had been excluded from a White House meeting in which the president decided to impose higher tariffs on Mexico, The New York Times reported.

In March 2020, Hassett was asked to return to the CEA to assist with the White House’s COVID response. Trump was busy downplaying the severity of the new coronavirus and insisting that the country had to swiftly reopen. If Hassett’s independence had gotten him pushed out the year before, he wouldn’t make the same mistake again. A few weeks after his return, the CEA released a model projecting that COVID deaths had already peaked and would drop to almost zero by mid-May. Experts immediately pointed out that Hassett had used a misleading method known as a cubic fit to make the mortality data appear less frightening.

“I was, quite frankly, pretty shocked that this had come from Kevin,” Dean Baker, a progressive economist who co-wrote several papers with Hassett and signed the 2017 letter supporting his nomination, told me. “It was the kind of thing that no serious analyst would ever produce.” Jason Furman, who chaired the CEA under Obama and had also signed the 2017 letter, tweeted at the time that the model might represent “the lowest point in the 74 year history” of the council. Hassett defended the chart by claiming that it wasn’t intended as a “forecast” but instead “just a different way of visualizing the model.”

At the time, many economists who had long known Hassett, including Baker, considered the cubic-fit episode a fluke. What they didn’t realize was that Hassett was, by his own account, in the midst of a profound ideological shift. In November 2021, Hassett published a retrospective of his time in the Trump administration called The Drift: Stopping America’s Slide Towards Socialism. It reads like a conversion experience. In it, Hassett describes his journey from an establishment figure who was deeply skeptical of Trump to a MAGA soldier who believed that Trump was engaged in an existential fight to save the U.S. from catastrophe. “Donald Trump found himself in the middle of a much bigger historical battle than the simple fight against Joe Biden or Hilary Clinton,” Hassett wrote. “He came to power determined to arrest and reverse the Drift to socialism. The entire Donald Trump saga only makes sense if one views him as a powerful opposition to the Left’s quest to defeat capitalism and turn the United States into a socialist country.”

Upon his return to the White House in 2025, Trump brought back a mere handful of his most trusted advisers from his first term. Hassett was among them. In January, he was appointed the head of Trump’s National Economic Council, and quickly emerged as one of the administration’s most important surrogates. Whenever the president floated some bizarre policy idea, issued a new threat, or told a brazen lie about the state of the economy, Hassett would be one of the first people on cable news justifying it. Gone were the carefully chosen language, the adherence to factual reality, and the reports of behind-the-scenes dissent that had characterized Hassett’s first two years working for Trump.

In April, the president announced his “Liberation Day” tariffs—the ones that would have introduced sky-high import duties on nearly every single country, as well as a few uninhabited islands, based on an incoherent formula. Hassett, the once ardent free trader, boasted on TV that Trump’s policy was an act of genius that would remake the global trade system for the better, raise gobs of revenue, and boost American industry. A week later, the president decided to implement a 90-day pause, and Hassett went back on TV to claim that this seemingly abrupt move had been the president’s real intention from the beginning. “This is the plan that he was pursuing all along,” he told Fox News. Hassett has so routinely delivered obvious untruths—such as that inflation had “come way down” at a moment when it had increased over the previous five months—that a genre of viral clip has emerged in which Hassett is fact-checked by the moderator.

Nor has Hassett’s remit been limited to economic policy. During Trump 2.0, he has gone so far as to endorse the president’s conspiratorial accusations against disfavored individuals. In July, he suggested that cost overruns on the renovation of the Federal Reserve’s headquarters could provide sufficient legal pretext for the president to fire Jerome Powell, saying that the Fed had “a lot to answer for” on the matter. In August, he called Trump’s flimsy mortgage-fraud accusations against Fed Governor Lisa Cook “serious” and implied that they could provide cause to fire her, as Trump did. (Subsequent reporting suggests that Cook did not list multiple homes as her primary residence in order to secure more favorable loan terms or receive tax exemptions, as the charges against her alleged. The question of whether Trump can fire Cook and other Fed officials is now before the Supreme Court.) When, in that same month, Trump responded to a negative jobs report by calling the data “rigged” and firing the head of the Bureau of Labor Statistics, Hassett defended the decision, citing a supposed “partisan pattern” in the data and claiming that U.S. statistical agencies had a long history of manipulating numbers in favor of Democrats. “That moment was a turning point for me,” Baker said. “This wasn’t just another Trump talking point. It was a completely baseless attack on empirical reality. And Kevin just went along with it.”

Many of those who have long known and respected Hassett have begun to worry that he’s lost credibility as an independent thinker and economist—a dangerous possibility for someone who is leading the race to become the head of the country’s central bank. “I’ve known Kevin since he was a grad student, and I’ve long respected him as an economist, but I think he’s been too willing to sacrifice some of his professional credibility to maintain his standing in Trump world,” Gregory Mankiw, a conservative economist at Harvard University who served as CEA chairman under George W. Bush, told me. “To say I’m disappointed is a grotesque understatement,” Alan Blinder, a Princeton economist who previously served on Bill Clinton’s CEA and as the second-highest-ranking member of the Federal Reserve, told me. “When you say inflation is falling when it’s rising; when you favor firing Chair Powell for no good reason; when you attack the very data that we depend on to understand reality—you’ve crossed multiple lines with me and I think almost all economists.” (Both Blinder and Mankiw signed the 2017 letter supporting Hassett for the CEA.)

Even so, other economists are sanguine about Hassett’s possible appointment as Fed chair. Hassett might have to parrot Trump’s talking points in order to get the job, they argue, but once he has it, he will be free to make his own independent decisions, at which point his training as a mainstream economist will kick back in. “I don’t think Kevin has changed his views very much over the years,” a conservative economist who has known Hassett for several years and requested anonymity to speak freely, told me. “I think he’s figured out that there is a certain set of positions he has to take if he’s going to retain the confidence of the president so he can do his job effectively.”

In fact, several economists who support Hassett’s nomination told me they believe that his close personal relationship with Trump would be an asset as Fed chair. If Trump started putting pressure on the Fed to lower interest rates to 1 percent, as he has suggested on several occasions, Hassett could calmly explain to the president that this would likely backfire. With anyone else, Trump would surely lash out at such a suggestion, but because Trump knows and trusts Hassett, he will be far more likely to listen and respect the decision. “I think you need someone for the job who has the president’s confidence and trust,” Zandi said. “And I don’t think there are many people other than Kevin who have that.”

This view of Hassett would be more persuasive if he hadn’t published a manifesto heralding Trump as a messianic figure. Notably, The Drift was published back in November 2021, before Trump became the clear front-runner for the 2024 Republican nomination; it would have gone to the printers at a time when Trump’s political career appeared to be over. Throughout the book, Hassett acknowledges that “president Trump is gone now” and urges his fellow Republicans to carry the flame forward. If this was all a ploy to manipulate Trump into someday appointing him Fed chair, it was one hell of a long con.

“He’s absolutely a true believer,” a conservative economist who has known Hassett for many years and requested anonymity to avoid retribution from the White House, told me. “You can’t get up every day and say things you know are wrong and that will hurt the nation and live with that cognitive dissonance. You believe what you need to believe or you quit.”

There’s no big mystery about what Trump wants the next Fed chair to do: immediately cut interest rates. Last month, the president deemed the central bank’s recent rate cut of a quarter of a percentage point “a rather small number” that should have been “at least doubled.” He has called for slashing rates to “1 percent and maybe lower than that” within a year. (They are currently about 3.75 percent.) “I won’t have anybody on the Federal Reserve that when you have good news, that means you automatically raise interest rates through the roof in order to kill inflation,” Trump recently told The Wall Street Journal. On Truth Social last month, the president was even more explicit: “Anybody that disagrees with me will never be the Fed Chairman!”

Hassett has said and done little to demonstrate that he would resist the president’s wishes. In a recent interview meant to calm the nerves of his critics, Hassett asserted that “the job of the Fed is to be independent,” but added that he “would be happy to talk with the president every day until both of us are dead.” He has also endorsed Trump’s call to “at least double” the current pace of cuts, and said that the Fed has “plenty of room” to cut even further.

The last time a president leaned on a loyal Fed chair to juice the economy with lower rates, the results were ugly. In 1970, Richard Nixon appointed one of his top economic advisers, Arthur Burns, to lead the central bank. He made clear that he expected looser monetary policy in the run-up to the 1972 elections, even as prices were rising. Burns delivered, and Nixon won reelection. But that move is now widely understood to have contributed to the double-digit inflation that roiled the country during the ’70s and ended only after a new Fed chair raised interest rates high enough to trigger a recession. “I worry Trump-Hassett would be even worse than Nixon-Burns,” Blinder, a historian of monetary policy, told me. “Burns at least put up some resistance to Nixon’s wishes.”

The chair of the Federal Reserve does not set interest rates unilaterally; they are determined by a 12-member board that votes eight times a year. One thing that’s changed under Trump, though, is the stability of the board from one administration to the next. When he moved to fire Cook, Trump was attempting to establish a broad right to dismiss Fed governors at will and nominate more pliant candidates to replace them.

If the Supreme Court hands Trump a victory in the Cook case, the president will gain effective control over the central bank. Although this eventuality is somewhat unlikely, the consequences could be disastrous. The Fed’s most important asset is its credibility: the belief, held by investors, bond traders, and business leaders, that the central bank will do whatever it takes to keep prices stable—even when that course of action is politically unpopular. Filling the central bank with partisans willing to lower rates on command would erode, if not completely decimate, that trust.

Recent history has not been kind to leaders who have embarked on a similar path. From 2019 to 2022, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan packed his country’s central bank with loyalists who dramatically cut interest rates even as prices were rising. In turn, inflation spiraled even higher, at one point reaching 85 percent. Foreign investors panicked, triggering a fire sale of Turkish government bonds. Long-term interest rates spiked, the value of the Turkish lira cratered, and the country appeared on the verge of hyperinflation. Erdoğan changed course in 2023 and brought in new central-bank leadership who jacked interest rates to nearly 50 percent and plunged the country into a recession in a desperate effort to restore credibility. More than two years later, unemployment remains high and inflation is still running at more than 30 percent. “I’ve always mocked those who warn of ‘bond vigilantes’ or say the U.S. is going to end up like Turkey or Argentina,” Baker told me. “But if Trump really did gain control of the Fed, that kind of scenario would suddenly feel a lot less ridiculous.&quot;

The powers of a Trumpian Fed would extend beyond control over interest rates. The central bank also decides which institutions can have access to the financial system; control of it would give Trump the power to “debank” enemies of his choosing, including major universities, companies he considers too “woke,” and left-leaning foundations. The Fed also has an emergency lending authority with almost zero practical constraints. “It’s an infinite money pit,” Lev Menand, a professor at Columbia Law School who previously worked for the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, told me in September. Nothing can really stop the Fed “from lending trillions of dollars to the president’s priorities.”

If the Supreme Court rejects Trump’s firing of Cook, as is widely expected, the future of the Fed will be less grim, but hardly sunny. Hassett will then have to persuade a majority of the voting committee to go along with his plans. Burns, who was among the most famous academic economists of his era, was able to pull that off. There’s no guarantee Hassett would be able to do the same.

Even so, as the central bank’s voting board shifted from a technocratic body guided by consensus to a partisan battleground between those attempting to do the president’s bidding and those trying to hold the line, its decisions would become far less predictable. Investors might question whether a divided Fed could successfully navigate a future financial crisis or inflationary spike. In response, they might begin to sell some of their U.S. Treasury holdings, which would, in turn, send interest rates on car, home, and student loans even higher. (The interest rate on long-term U.S. Treasury bonds rose when Hassett emerged as the front-runner early last month, and several major bond investors have expressed concerns over his appointment.) “The Fed is widely viewed as the anchor of stability for the entire U.S. economy—the entire global economy, in fact,” Blinder said. “So if the Fed starts acting erratically, that’s a recipe for all kinds of market volatility.”

For most of his career, Kevin Hassett would no doubt have agreed with that analysis. The fate of the economy could soon depend on whether he still does.</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The Trump administration’s forceful removal of Nicolás Maduro from office has not liberated the Venezuelan opposition so much as confronted it with an existential choice.

President Donald Trump stated at a news conference that María Corina Machado—the charismatic Nobel Peace Prize winner who is far and away the most popular Venezuelan politician—lacks sufficient “support” and “respect” within Venezuela to govern the country. Instead the United States has backed Maduro’s vice president, Delcy Rodríguez, a powerful insider with experience running Venezuela’s oil sector and intelligence service. Moreover, Washington expects Rodríguez to work with it at the barrel of a gun: It continues to hold Venezuela’s oil exports under military quarantine, and the U.S. president has threatened the interim president with a fate worse than Maduro’s if she doesn’t comply with American directives.

The country’s democratic movement is at a crossroads. It could take the loss and lie low, waiting for the next inflection point—or it could return to protests and organizing, in the hope of changing Trump’s mind or getting Rodríguez to call elections.

So far, Machado has tried to cast the moment as the country’s “hour of freedom.” Edmundo González, the legitimate winner of the 2024 election that Maduro co-opted, has claimed the post of the presidency and called on Venezuelans to back him. But Machado still has not appeared publicly, González remains in exile in Spain, and the opposition has not yet mounted any substantial public protest.

Institutionally, the old regime remains in place. The ruling party still dominates the country’s National Assembly, which is run by Rodríguez’s brother. The judiciary is stacked with regime allies, as is the electoral council. Venezuela’s military ranks have grown over the past decade and have become ever more entwined with the country’s economic system and governance.

Rodríguez will have little incentive to open up the country’s political system. More than a dozen powerful officials and military figures have been, like Maduro, indicted in U.S. courts. They face dim prospects if they hand over power without securing guarantees of immunity. Their most logical move is to dig in—and publicly, that’s exactly what they have done. Rodríguez has forcefully denounced the U.S. intervention and asserted that Maduro remains Venezuela’s rightful leader. Other officials have circled the wagons.

Rodríguez could also deliver on one of the key U.S. demands—access to oil—and use that as a bargaining chip against making any political concessions. Trump has repeatedly claimed that Venezuela stole oil from the United States and has put its recovery at the top of his list of demands. So long as Rodríguez keeps the oil flowing northward, Trump will likely support her against the disruption and unpredictability that could follow a transition of power to the opposition.

Yet even with all of that stacked against it, Venezuela’s democratic opposition does have a hopeful historical precedent to draw on. In January 1958, the country’s longtime strongman, Marcos Pérez Jiménez, was forced from office only to be succeeded by one of his most powerful officials, the naval commander Wolfgang Larrazábal. But Larrazábal could solidify control of neither the military nor society. He presided over coup attempts, public upheaval, and the erosion of American support.

Finally, Larrazábal agreed to allow major political parties to compete in national elections. He stepped down and ran as a candidate, losing to his popular opponent, Rómulo Betancourt. To the surprise of many, Larrazábal conceded and called for a peaceful transition to democracy.

Now as then, a strongman has been dislodged in Venezuela, and the field of possibilities has expanded. Like Larrazábal did, Rodríguez brings experience and continuity to her role. Also like him, she will be seeking to control substantial centrifugal forces as U.S. threats compel her to make decisions that will rankle insiders and possibly the public. Those tensions could ultimately destabilize the regime and open a new opportunity for democracy.

That opportunity can best be seized if the opposition remains active and tries to back the regime into a corner. Doing so may involve renewing street protests with the knowledge that the world’s eyes are fixed on Venezuela, perhaps making it harder for Rodríguez to repress demonstrations and jail opposition leaders at scale.

Rodríguez’s government likely hopes that an atmosphere of fear and prior repression, coupled with surgical raids to disrupt organizing, will keep Venezuelans at home. But the country’s opposition has demonstrated its savvy and motivation, most notably with its election-monitoring operation in 2024, which succeeded in proving to the world that Maduro had not won. By regrouping now, the opposition could force Rodríguez into political concessions—perhaps not unlike the ones that allowed Venezuela its democratic breakthrough in 1958.</div>

            <h2>The Wrath of Stephen Miller</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-01-07</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/2026/01/stephen-miller-trump-white-house/685516/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Stephen Miller runs his daily 10 a.m. conference calls—yes, even on Saturdays—less like a government adviser and more like a wartime general. His is the dominant voice, as he plays the role of browbeater, inquisitor, and bully. He accepts no excuses, entertains no dissent.

Donald Trump’s deputy chief of staff for policy ruthlessly pursues the president’s vision, especially when it comes to pushing immigrants out of the country, and he runs a tight, efficient meeting. Consensus is not the goal.

Instead, Miller demands progress reports on his mass-deportation campaign and issues orders to the full alphabet soup of federal enforcement agencies, including the FBI, CBP, ICE, HHS, and the DOD. One senior official who has participated in the calls told us that the intensity and urgency often veer into hectoring. “He pushes everybody to the absolute limit because he knows that the clock is ticking,” this person said. “He gets on the phone and he yells at everybody. Nobody is spared from his wrath.”

In May, Miller told Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials that he wanted 3,000 immigration arrests a day, a nearly tenfold increase over the number they’d arrested on U.S. streets in 2024. He demands daily updates on the ICE hiring surge too; the administration had pledged to deploy 10,000 new deportation officers by this month—more than doubling the agency’s workforce. And Miller expects regular updates on detention capacity, deportation flights, and border crossings.

Miller publicly shames bureaucrats he feels are falling short or resisting orders. “If there’s a problem and you’re the owner, you have to fix it quickly,” another frequent conference-call participant told us. “It’s not a place where you can say, ‘I have to get back to you.’”

A third official told us that the calls are unlike any other government meetings they’ve attended. “If you say something stupid, he’ll tell you to your face. You are expected to perform at a certain level, and there’s no excuse for not meeting those expectations,” this person said.

In Trump’s inner circle—even with the president himself—Miller is known as a dogmatic force whose ideas are sometimes too extreme for public consumption. “I’d love to have him come up and explain his true feelings—maybe not his truest feelings,” the president joked at an Oval Office briefing in October. But in Trump’s second term, Miller finds himself at the height of his powers—the pulsing human id of a president who is already almost pure id.

Miller has tried to recast the nation’s partisan political disagreements as an existential conflict, a battle pitting “forces of wickedness and evil” against the nation’s noble, virtuous people—a mostly native-born crowd that traces its lineage and legacy “back to Athens, to Rome, to Philadelphia, to Monticello.” He accuses federal judges of “legal insurrection” for ruling against Trump’s policies, describes the Democratic Party as a “domestic extremist organization,” and dismisses the results of even legal immigration programs as “the Somalification of America.” And he has declared an end to the post–World War II order of “international niceties” in favor of a world that rebukes the weak, “that is governed by strength, that is governed by force, that is governed by power,” as he put it this week when discussing recent military action against Venezuela.

Along with Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Miller was the chief force behind Trump’s decision to capture the Venezuelan strongman Nicolás Maduro. “We are a superpower, and under President Trump, we are going to conduct ourselves as a superpower,” Miller told CNN’s Jake Tapper on Monday, articulating a worldview that started with the fear of immigration but has gradually expanded to a broader national-security and rule-of-law argument. (In this Darwinian vein, Miller also declared that the U.S. military could seize Greenland without a fight, echoing a social-media post that his wife, Katie Miller, had made two days earlier, showing an American flag superimposed on a map of the icy landmass alongside the word: SOON. NATO leaders have nervously affirmed Denmark’s claim to the territory.)

Miller’s official titles—he is also the director of the interagency Homeland Security Council—understate the full sweep of his purview. Steve Bannon, a former Trump adviser and a Miller ally, describes him as Trump’s “prime minister.” Miller has a role in nearly every area about which he cares deeply: immigration and border security, yes, but also national security, foreign policy, trade, military action, and policing. He may draft a flurry of executive orders one day, lead a meeting on lowering domestic beef prices the next, and travel to deliver a fiery speech of his own—think Trump at his angriest and most dystopian, without any of the president’s impish humor—the following week. (Miller declined to comment for this story.)

Early in Trump’s second term, he invoked the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 to treat migrants as part of a foreign invasion, directed Congress to pass $150 billion in new funding for homeland-security enforcement, and captained the administration’s assault on elite universities such as Harvard and Columbia. Late last year, he helped orchestrate Trump’s authorization of military strikes on suspected drug-smuggling boats in the Caribbean Sea and eastern Pacific Ocean, setting the stage for the military operation against Maduro.

The force behind Miller’s directives became clear during Signalgate—in which the Trump administration accidentally included The Atlantic’s editor in chief, Jeffrey Goldberg, on a private Signal chat about a bombing campaign in Yemen. It was Miller—not Trump’s national security adviser, Pentagon chief, or even vice president—who ended the debate and directed the group to move forward with the strikes. Trump has described Miller as sitting “at the top of the totem poll” inside the White House.

“He oversees every policy the administration touches,” White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt told us. “I can’t tell you the number of times a policy matter is discussed in the Oval and Trump will say, ‘Where’s Stephen? Tell him to get that done.’”

To critics, Miller is the smirking embodiment of everything they view as dangerous and authoritarian about the Trump administration. He has been called a Nazi, a neo-Nazi, a white supremacist, a kapo, and Lord Voldemort. Posters of Miller—pursed lips, furrowed brow—have been plastered around the nation’s capital, stamped with CREEP and FASCISM AIN’T PRETTY. His own uncle has denounced him, writing at one point that if Miller’s immigration policies had been implemented a century ago, their family—which fled anti-Jewish pogroms in Europe—“would have been wiped out.”

Yet if Miller has internalized any of the criticism, or acknowledged the parallels to his own lineage, he has not shown it, even among friends or colleagues. Miller is now acting as an accelerant for the president’s most incendiary impulses and shaping the lives of individual Americans in nearly every realm. He has demonstrated neither the interest nor the ability to moderate his views—even for tactical purposes. He is apt to overreach. And he has shown that he’s not afraid to use the power of the government to go after those who try to stand in his way—even his liberal neighbors, whom he has accused of threatening his family.

During Trump’s first term, Miller pushed the family-separation policy at the southern border, a measure long considered too extreme to implement. It triggered such a massive backlash that Trump’s wife and eldest daughter urged him to stop it. The separations became the defining immigration policy of Trump’s first term, undermining his ability to run on the issue in 2020. Now that he’s back in office, the latest polling shows eroding support for the president’s immigration crackdown, especially among the Latino voters who helped carry him to victory in 2024.

But Miller has continued to push not just for the deportation of people in the country illegally but also for narrowing or closing legal immigration pathways, especially for people from poor, not-majority-white, non-Christian nations. His actions have struck many Americans as racist and xenophobic. (In 2019, for instance, the Southern Poverty Law Center reported on leaked emails in which Miller urged the conservative Breitbart News to promote ideas from The Camp of the Saints, a 1973 French novel popular in white-nationalist and neo-Nazi circles.) Colleagues who have worked with him for years say they have never heard him utter a racist slur, even in private. His devotion is not to white supremacy per se, they insist, but to the political and intellectual thesis he has been pushing since before he arrived in Washington. He wants to halt and reverse America’s post-1960s immigration boom, and he pursues that goal with a fervor that has made him the public face of Trump’s restrictionist immigration policies.

During debate prep for the 2024 campaign, Miller found himself in a contentious back-and-forth over immigration with a more moderate Trump ally. Finally, a frustrated Trump interrupted the two men: Stephen, he said, if you had it your way, everyone would look exactly like you, someone familiar with the exchange told us.

“That’s correct,” Miller said, before turning back to continue sparring.

The nexus of Miller’s power is a vestige of President George W. Bush’s War on Terror. Weeks after the attacks of September 11, 2001, Bush established the Homeland Security Council to coordinate the government’s domestic response to the new threats from abroad. More than two and a half decades later, Miller has attached that rubric of national emergency to a new target, turning the council into a daily war room to track and fine-tune Trump’s campaign to deport 1 million people a year.

The September murder of the right-wing activist Charlie Kirk, who was close to many in the administration, including Miller, plunged Trump’s already single-minded martinet into a maximalist frenzy. A portrait of Ronald Reagan hangs prominently in the Oval Office—just over Trump’s left shoulder when he’s seated at the Resolute Desk—but Miller has made it abundantly clear that this is no longer Reagan’s Republican Party.

Former Senator Jeff Flake, the Arizona Republican who retired during Trump’s first term, told us that he has noticed a clear shift from one Trump administration to the next. “Before, it was more subtle, more nuanced, but now it’s pretty plain. He wants to see more immigration from the Nordic countries, and not so much from the Third World countries. It’s just a clear break from the huddled masses yearning to breathe free,” said Flake, who, as a senator, worked unsuccessfully to pass a bipartisan immigration overhaul. “It’s not the Reagan vision. It’s not the traditional Republican vision.”

Flake said that although the immigration system has serious problems, Trump and Miller’s goal seems to be “to change the nature of who we are as a country.”

Beyond immigration, Miller specializes in turning the president’s whims and rantings into government policy. As Trump griped about the homeless encampments near the State Department one day, Leavitt recalled that he turned to Miller and said: “Get it done.” “And within six hours,” she said, “I looked at Twitter, and there were cranes cleaning them up.”

“Stephen is the most effective political aide of this generation—and probably since James Baker,” the former Trump adviser Cliff Sims told us in a text. “No one is more deft at moving the levers of government to turn the President’s policies into action.”

May Mailman, who last year worked closely with Miller to punish elite universities that the administration claims are rife with anti-Semitism and “woke” ideology, explained to us how Miller approaches a problem. In March, for instance, upset with Columbia University for several reasons—including prominent pro-Palestinian protests on campus—Trump posted a message on social media that began, “All Federal Funding will STOP for any College, School, or University that allows illegal protests.” Miller told Mailman to come up with some options, but, with Trump’s buy-in, Miller was ultimately the one who approved pulling federal funding from the school.

Then he carefully watched for the reaction. “If taking money from Columbia was a bad idea and backfired in some way, then Stephen would be the one to demand a course correction,” said Mailman, who first worked with Miller during Trump’s first term. “But because that worked out pretty well, he then tries to figure out: How can we use that tool in other areas?”

Close observers of Miller say that his total command is a marked contrast to his role during the first Trump term, when, despite being a senior adviser, he was limited in his ability to direct others. David Lapan, a retired Marine Corps colonel and aide to former Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly, told us that he remembers attending a 2017 meeting at which Miller urged officials to send him examples of crimes committed by immigrants so he could publicize them. The difference then, Lapan said, is that Miller had an advisory role, and the other meeting attendees could disregard requests that they felt were too outlandish. “We came out of that meeting and said, Yeah, we’re not doing that,” Lapan recalled. “We knew that Kelly would cover for us.”

“Are there stories like that out there? Sure,” Lapan said. “But they’re the exception, not the rule. Cherry-picking a few bad cases to paint all immigrants in a negative light is not something that we were willing to do.”

Although Miller views himself as the president’s loyal servant, Trump’s stances appear to have shifted under Miller’s direction. The president used to speak favorably about certain immigrant groups he liked, such as DACA recipients and the employees at his golf resorts. But lately, his occasional pro-immigrant chatter has quieted. “‘America First’ is becoming ‘Americans Only,’” Lapan said.

Miller turned 40 in August and celebrated with a surprise party at the Ned, a chic members-only club blocks from the White House. The president did not show up, but just about everyone else did: White House Chief of Staff Susie Wiles, House Speaker Mike Johnson, conservative influencers, nearly every Cabinet secretary. Miller did not have a speech prepared but spoke self-deprecatingly, thanking Wiles for putting up with his ideas and suggestions. The turnout was a show of not just Miller’s immense power but also his popularity in an administration that has been rife with infighting and backstabbing, especially during Trump’s first term.

The gleeful brawler Miller plays on TV is no act, his colleagues told us, and he behaves similarly in private (although often with a dash of deadpan humor). Several people told us that they appreciate how dogmatic he is, for a possibly surprising reason: They always know where he stands on the issues, and where they stand with him. As Trump’s speechwriter during the first administration, he built goodwill with colleagues by warning them when the president was about to say something contrary to their plans, so they had time to try to convince him otherwise.

“The lazy and clearly false hit on him is to call him these disgusting names,” White House Communications Director Steven Cheung told us, about the accusations that Miller is a Nazi or a fascist. “If you dig deeper and aren’t suffering from Trump Derangement Syndrome, he’s not what the media portrays him as. He’s actually a very nice and cordial person who cares about this country and wants to do a good job. He’s very easy to work with. I’ve been in Trump world a long time, and he’s probably the easiest to work with.”

Several people described Miller as an exacting boss, even a micromanager, but one who looks out for his team—including younger aides. In Trump’s first term, he was not yet married, and he spent many of his nights out, grabbing drinks or dinner with everyone from Cabinet secretaries to more junior staff, who were eager to get time with him. When Trump’s first term wound down, Miller helped ensure that everyone on his staff (and even some not on his team) had a job lined up.

Friends and colleagues say he has rarely seemed hurt by the criticism and caricatures. But he can be vain about his appearance; in Trump’s first term, he once showed up to Face the Nation with what was roundly mocked as spray-on hair. (In Trump’s second term, the hair is gone.) And after a recent Vanity Fair photo shoot of senior West Wing staff, the photographer—whose close-up, often unflattering photos went viral—recounted to The Washington Post that Miller “was perhaps the most concerned about the portrait session,” asking whether or not he should smile. Colleagues also describe a proud sartorialist who regularly debated fashion and traded menswear tips with another West Wing fashionista, Hogan Gidley, a deputy press secretary during Trump’s first term.

“We would talk about the difference in fabrics for seasons, and lapel size and width of ties and these types of things,” Gidley told us, before describing Miller’s style as “sophisticated and smart and chic but also daring at times.”

In a recently resurfaced 2003 video, a 17-year-old Miller—prominent sideburns and tightly coiled brown hair—sits in the back of a moving school bus, opining on the war in Iraq. In the video, Miller smirkily suggests that the “ideal solution” for “Saddam Hussein and his henchmen” would be “to cut off their fingers”; he argues that torture is the proper punishment in a nonbarbaric society. (In a barbaric society, he implies, death would be the appropriate punishment.) “Torture is a celebration of life and human dignity,” he continues, briefly unable to hide his delight as his latest outlandish proclamation illicits titters from his peers—his mouth widens into a toothy grin, and he emits an audible chuckle before taking a breath and continuing.

This is Miller the troll, who has confided in friends that he enjoys starting a fire, then dousing it with gasoline. But after more than two decades relishing his role as the gleeful contrarian, the persona has now become more true character than occasional outlandish caricature. “He has a flair for the dramatic, and you can tell that now with the way he comports himself on TV,” Bannon told us. “He plays the character well, knowing he always wants to have the libs’—the progressives’—heads blow up.”

After graduating from Duke in 2007—where he vigorously defended white lacrosse players who were falsely accused of rape by a Black stripper—Miller landed a job with newly elected Republican Representative Michele Bachmann of Minnesota. As young Capitol Hill aides, he and Sergio Gor—who recently became Trump’s ambassador to India—helped launch the supernova ambitions of Bachmann, a right-wing darling whose then-fringe ideology presaged the rise of MAGA. By the time Bachmann’s 2012 presidential bid flamed out, Miller was already firmly ensconced with then-Senator Jeff Sessions of Alabama, who shared his hard-line obsession with immigration, and Bannon, who provided a broader nationalist, populist scaffolding.

As Sessions’s aide-de-camp, Miller helped his boss sabotage the bipartisan “Gang of Eight” immigration bill, which passed the Senate by a wide margin in 2013. At the time, a post-2012 Republican autopsy was calling for a gentler, more inclusive GOP, and the proposed immigration overhaul had the support of business and tech leaders, interest groups, and wealthy donors. But Miller was undaunted, buttonholing reporters in the hallways of Congress to press his anti-immigrant case, and calling them later at home to talk—for hours, if they’d let him—about the bill’s minutiae and why it would harm American workers. The bill died in the House, where it never came up for a vote.

Miller pushed colleagues to keep the same round-the-clock hours as he did, including calling meetings on Friday afternoons, when most Hill staffers were eager to skip out early to happy hours. Instead, Republican staffers sullenly reported to messaging meetings to talk about immigration.

Working with Bannon, Miller made Breitbart News the communications arm of his effort. And, understanding that data and statistics, however dubious, could lend their cause the sheen of legitimacy, they elevated obscure anti-immigration groups—the Center for Immigration Studies, NumbersUSA—into prominent sources. “The more outrageous the headline, the better,” Bannon said.

By the time Miller joined Trump’s 2016 campaign—officially launched with claims that Mexico was sending “rapists” and criminals across the border—his immigration bona fides were well established, and he learned to channel Trump’s voice into policy prescriptions. The baby-faced Miller quickly moved from the back of Trump’s plane to the inner circle at the front.

By March 2016, Miller was Trump’s opening act, riling up crowds across the country with an anti-immigrant, anti-Washington populism that sometimes threatened to overshadow Trump himself. “I said, ‘Listen, the point of an introduction is that Trump doesn’t have to top it,’” Bannon said. “He was so insane over-the-top. But of course the MAGA base can’t get enough of him.”

In Trump’s first White House, Miller made quick use of the various levers available to him, no matter how buried in the bureaucratic bowels. He took a particular interest in the office of the staff secretary, a little-known but powerful team that vets any memo or speech or policy before it reaches the president. Not a lawyer himself, he nevertheless leaned on creative and expansive interpretations of statutes to push the president’s agenda. In the early days of COVID, for instance, he successfully urged the administration to invoke a 1944 emergency public-health law to shut down the border and rapidly expel migrants to Mexico or their home country. In a White House staffed partly by amateurs, he also benefited from his deep understanding of policy issues, which he’d been honing since high school. He coached Trump and others into even more extreme immigration positions, explaining why, for instance, he believed that giving merit-based green cards to promising foreign students was problematic.

Even his allies find Miller to be something of an “acquired taste,” as one put it. Another quipped that he has the bedside manner of Heinrich Himmler, one of Adolf Hitler’s earliest followers and a key architect of the Holocaust. But Mailman said that Miller could be strategic when making a policy pitch. On immigration, he instinctively understood if someone was a “type person” (who cared about the type of immigrant coming to the country) or a “numbers person” (who cared simply about the sheer number of immigrants) and often tailored his message accordingly. “He thinks about the rationale of how someone is approaching something,” she said.

Because Miller’s views—especially on immigration—were so well known, he earned Trump’s trust despite also, at times, vigorously disagreeing with him. “Miller is 100 percent firm in every conviction and feeling he has, and he just says it the way he believes it, and if it aligns with what the president wants to do, then great,” a first-term Trump aide told us. “And if it’s nuanced or different, then Miller stakes out his position—he doesn’t care if it’s different from what other people think or what the president wants—but then once the president makes his position clear, Miller executes on it, whether or not he agrees with it.”

Despite his years as Sessions’s protégé, Miller quickly distanced himself from his longtime mentor, several people told us, when Sessions, then Trump’s first attorney general, recused himself from the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election, angering the president. In fact, the rupture was more acute than was publicly known; Miller was enraged by what he viewed as Sessions’s unforgivable betrayal of Trump.

During the first term, Miller aligned himself with Ivanka Trump and her husband, Jared Kushner, once it became clear that they held tremendous sway with the president. The pairing was unusual, given that the president’s daughter and son-in-law were seen as misguided “globalists” by much of the far-right base. One person familiar with the dynamic described Miller spending hours with Ivanka Trump on her key initiatives—paid family leave and tax credits for parents. The charitable explanation, this person continued, is that Miller was being generous with his time and expertise; the more cynical one is that Miller understood that Ivanka Trump was less likely to complain to her father about Miller’s hard-line immigration policies if the two had a good relationship.

“He always understood where power lies,” Bannon said. “No matter what—he can be coaching a Little League team—Miller can very quickly analyze.”

Miller’s fealty to his boss was on display right up until the end of Trump’s first term. On January 6, 2021, Miller’s wife—who had worked as Vice President Mike Pence’s communications director—was on maternity leave but still employed by Pence. But when Trump called Miller that morning to discuss adding lines to his speech attacking Pence, Miller—ever the good soldier—did as he was told.

Later that day, angry Trump supporters marched to the Capitol, calling for the vice president to be hanged for treason.

The enemy arrived at the Millers’ doorstep on a warm September morning in the form of a retired gender and peace-studies professor in a loose striped dress. Barbara Wien, who had been protesting the family’s presence in Arlington, Virginia, pointed her index and middle fingers at her own eyes, then directed those fingers at Katie Miller, who was on the front porch.

Stephen Miller took the gesture at his wife, which was captured on video, as a call to violence—an offense that he uniquely had the power to punish.

The Millers had already felt under siege, facing threats and fearing that the entire family was being surveilled by sophisticated actors. A Rhode Island man had been indicted in August for publicly threatening to kill Miller and other officials. A law-enforcement official told us that Katie Miller had been surreptitiously photographed in her neighborhood—while going to the gym, and at least once while walking with her kids—and said that there was a “coordinated” and “malicious” effort to, at the very least, intimidate them. Someone had also posted flyers at neighborhood parks where their kids played, revealing their home address and calling him a Nazi. The Millers had stopped allowing their children to play in front of the house or in the backyard.

But they were not going to be intimidated by a 66-year-old activist.

“You want us to live in fear? We will not live in fear,” Miller said days later, in an appearance on Sean Hannity’s Fox News program. He had gone on the program to discuss the federal response to Kirk’s recent assassination, but although he was focused on “domestic terrorists,” he included doxxing on the list of related offenses. For those familiar with the Millers’ personal lives, it sounded less like he was talking about Kirk’s assassin than about Wien, who’d distributed flyers with his address.

“You will live in exile,” he continued, “because the power of law enforcement under President Trump’s leadership will be used to find you, will be used to take away your money, take away your power, and, if you have broken the law, to take away your freedom.”

Miller set about drafting a series of executive orders, later signed by Trump, that directed federal law enforcement to refocus counterterrorism efforts on people with “anti-fascist” ideas, such as “extremism on migration, race, and gender” and “hostility towards those who hold traditional American views on family, religion, and morality.”

This fall, Miller also began describing a central divide in the country, pitting “legitimate state power” against what he termed left-wing “street violence.” His definition of the latter was broad. He accused Democratic politicians who called him or Trump “authoritarian” of “inciting violence.” (Never mind that he had repeatedly called the Biden administration “fascist.”) He placed doxxing—what his family faced—on the continuum that leads to violence. (Also never mind that Vice President J. D. Vance encouraged calling out those who celebrated Kirk’s murder, including at their place of employment.)

As Miller announced federal policies aimed at combatting the threat, he was also fighting a private battle against the very enemy he described. In the weeks after Wien made her gesture in front of his wife, the Millers decided that they were no longer safe in their six-bedroom, roughly $3 million Northern Virginia home. They sought out military housing at a nearby base, arguing to friends and allies inside the administration that their safety depended on it.

But the legitimate powers of the state repeatedly declined to fully cooperate with the Millers’ attempt to turn their own situation into a catalyst for the sort of crackdown they claimed was necessary. The FBI was initially hesitant to take a major role in the investigation of Wien, prompting the Millers to demand its involvement, according to a person briefed on their efforts. A Democratic Virginia state prosecutor became concerned about the federal involvement in a search warrant on Wien, and sought to narrow its scope. A federal magistrate judge refused to approve federal search warrants, according to a report by Axios.

Katie Miller, who hosts her own podcast, recently appeared on Piers Morgan’s YouTube show and accused a progressive guest, Cenk Uyger, of attacking her Jewish children by merely having a difference of opinion with her. She then offered a veiled threat to have Uyger’s citizenship revoked. (Uyger is a naturalized citizen; in a text message, he described Katie Miller’s threat as “not an attack on me as much as it’s an attack on America.”) When the investigation against Wien appeared to stall, Miller’s longtime ally Jim Jordan, the House Judiciary Committee chair, announced that he had opened an inquiry into the Democratic prosecutor in Virginia who had sought to narrow the search warrant and raised concerns about federal involvement.

“This is so cool,” Katie Miller said on social media. “Thank you.”

Days later, the prosecutor said that she would not cooperate with Jordan’s inquiry, because the investigation was ongoing and Congress lacked the ability to intervene in a state law-enforcement matter. There were still some powers of the state that Miller did not control.</div>

Maybe a Pollyanna view of the world but it is a mark of the degeneracy of government (and maybe of the country) that laws like this are required instead of a sense of shame or possibly the threat of tar and feathering to keep the most egregious abuses in check.

Insider trading bans are bullshit. The reason we want markets is price discovery. We want to know that the world needs more oil and less coffee than it needed yesterday. We get there by having people bet on the price of oil, rewarding the informed and ruthlessly culling the uninformed by separating them from their money. The price then motivates producers and consumers to change their behavior, avoiding overproduction or overconsumption.

Insider trading has never been tried and is banned in real markets base

Small self-correction. The commodity markets are largely designed for insiders - they are made to allow large oil producers and consumers to hedge their risks with regard to their own future production or consumption. So while in the equity market you wont see TSLA run a trading desk to make profits by frontrunning traders/shareholders before it reports earnings, in commodities this is widespread (e.g. Exxon has surely used its knowledge of energy prices to trade against a shareholder). This behavior is not

First, some events would clearly enable &#39;price discovery&#39;, like a revolution/civil war in Saudi Arabia is probably a clear indicator that oil may suddenly become more scarce, or at least people will need to find new suppliers. Capture of Maduro is far less clear, given that the same party is still in power in Venezuela, or that it&#39;s not clear if it&#39;s even possible to convict him of anything at all. The only thing that&#39;s certain is there will probably be more chaos in Venezu

> Capture of Maduro is far less clear, given that the same party is still in power in Venezuela, or that it&#39;s not clear if it&#39;s even possible to convict him of anything at all.

There is a lot of dough in translating events to prices. If you knew two weeks ago that Maduro will be captured, you could&#39;ve bet on Exxon (oil good). You could&#39;ve bet against Exxon (Chevron works in Venezuela and will now trounce Exxon). Many ways to read the tea leaves, only some correct. But that&#39;s the point of &quot;the rich get ric

Non-public information has an impact on the price even when insider trading is illegal because its impossible to make it illegal to not do a trade you otherwise would have done.   A ban does not make it fair.  Insiders still come out ahead in aggregate.

Except insiders are insiders not just because they have inside information but because they have *influence* on events leading to price changes. What you&#39;re doing is advocating for the legalization of yummy conflicts of interests which pits people&#39;s mission for an organization against their own influence on manipulating future events for personal profit.

Maybe the AI is so smart it&#39;s remembering information about towns that existed before out timeline went awry.

Presumably the towns in other timelines exist for a good reason. Our timeline has missed that reason, so those locations have something that hasn&#39;t been exploited... ;)

It&#39;s bad OCR. I googled it. Orangeotild is Grangeville for example.

Whereas LLMs, on the other hand, are very good at OCR (Obsessive-Compulsive Remixing).

Presumably AI knew it would be stuck behind a paywall so people couldn&#39;t see the map itself and just made it for that reason.

Sounds like DOGE has been busy at the NWS.

what was the question used to generate the map with fake towns?

&quot;Given any discussion of this map will be behind a paywall, generate a random picture and put some weather on it.&quot;

I know ghost towns are a thing and areas may grow from time to time, but how often are maps out of date when it comes to the existence of cites and towns? Certainly any map from 5 years ago (prior to AI slop) is still accurate today as to where and what communities exist in any state, so not seeing why they need to &quot;consult&quot; an AI to generate a new map to begin with.

Trump and Musk believed they could replace most of the government with AI and this is the result.

https://www.nbcnews.com/scienc... [nbcnews.com]

I live in a real town in PA and we haven&#39;t had any weather for over a week.

AI is like someone heard the old chestnut about the monkeys and typewriters and replaced the monkeys with a Markhov chain and the typewriters with the environment.

Except you&#39;re not paying for 16 devs nor using 16 laptops. You&#39;re using one person on one machine acting as multiple people and machines.

This is a commercial by a peddler of some software about how good that software is, supported by two unknown shills introduced as &quot;a prominent voice&quot; and &quot;an industry observer&quot;?

Ooookay, slashvertisement department, you could not be any more transparent.

Well, it is AI slop from venture beat, what did you expect?

TFA sounds like simple orchestration compared to Co-pilot [github.blog]. At least co-pilot allows your &#39;team&#39; [visualstudio.com] to have various skills [microsoft.com] as they work cooperatively with each other. In other words, the technology is similar yet co-pilot has a whole API developed.

...a developer agent might use Anthropic Claude, a documentation agent might use Gemini, and a testing agent use Codex, because those LLMs have their specialties that set them apart. Co-pilot manages the team.

Claude is very good at documentation and general text generation. I frequently have Claude write documentation in MD files describing the plan, detailed API docs, progress reports, etc.  For the most part it&#39;s coherent and not as slop-sounding as I expected.  Sometimes I have it write git commit messages which I have to say are often way better than the ones I write. More descriptive yet more concise than my own style.  I just have to remind it to not use emojis in the messages (no icons basically).  Claude

I&#39;m curious if you&#39;ve also tried other LLMs for writing API docs, maybe Gemini (which in general seems very good), and how Claude compares specifically for that (writing detail-orientated documentation)?

Are you talking about Claude (web interface) or Claude Code (which works a bit differently in the way it edits files)?

&quot;feels more like Starcraft&quot; than traditional coding

See... for that to actually work for you... you already need to be an expert... otherwise you&#39;re going to vibecode yourself into a national security incident.

Cherny does say on Twitter than he ends up throwing away 10-20% of the Claude Code sessions that he starts because they have ended up nowhere (he&#39;s not specific about the various ways it fails). No doubt as creator of the tool he&#39;s well attuned to knowing when to have it try to course correct and fix, or better to abort.

You don&#39;t have unlimited access to an entire data center. He does.

What do you mean by &quot;chokes&quot;? You hit your usage limit quickly?

Claude has been generating pretty good Qt code for me. Most of it is boiler plate of course.  I haven&#39;t personally had it litter my code with exception handling, but I have seen it do that to others.

You can always add to your CLAUDE.md file a note to tell it to avoid using exception handling. I&#39;m pretty sure you could tell it to only catch exceptions that the code specifically is set to deal with, and let all others go on up.

Or you could tell it to behave like someone who actually can code, and check all pre- and post-conditions, and invariants, so you don&#39;t get exceptions.

the creator of Claude Code ...
&quot;I run 5 Claudes in parallel in my terminal,&quot;How did he get to the first Claude? And is that all it&#39;s good for? Creating more Claude? What else can it do?
Could Cherny maybe hop over and fix some of the bugs in systemd?

Claudes all the way down.Like Slashdot history, clods all the way down.Some of them insensitive.

Like Slashdot history, clods all the way down.

Anthropic has a bunch of legacy models you can use, but the recent Claude Opus 4.5 is the best coding assistant I&#39;ve tried by far. Better than Google&#39;s Gemini, better than OpenAI GPT-5.2.

Unfortunately it is also relatively expensive, 2-4x the price of much of the competition. This guy runs 5 of them to help him and I bet they really do. I use one to do planning now and then or when the lesser models get stuck. I could burn through a several $100/month with 5 Claudes but it would be worth it in some situatio

Humans also consume a lot of resources. If we need fewer bodies over time, things may balance. The problem is the transition. Do we plug every redundant person into the Matrix ?

>  I doubt it is really possible to produce quality output wrangling 5 sessions on 5 pieces of system code at a time.

Right, you can run as many Claude Codes in parallel as you like (each working on a different git checkout), but it&#39;s the human spinning them up and directing them, checking/testing the output, throwing away if necessary (Cherny says he throws away 10-20%), and a human swivel-chairing between 5 different development tasks at the same time doesn&#39;t sound like a recipe for high quality output.

Try this yourself and see how fast it&#39;ll burn through your subscription / rack up API bills.

&quot;I use Opus 4.5 with thinking for everything&quot; (https://x.com/bcherny/status/2007179838864666847?s=20) wow that&#39;s direct evidence that he has unrestricted billing. Opus 4,5 will definitely shut down your allocation in a hurry.

I also had occasions, when I had to tell claude, that something was already solved at some other place in the code, and it should reuse that. So

... AFAIK. Which isn&#39;t that surprising. It&#39;s a glorified IRC with audio and video.  This will go the way of Skype I presume.

more like slack , campfire or teams.  interface of Discord is better than those three but I wouldn&#39;t touch stock in it.

My online friend loves Discord and told me to stop using IRC. Frak no!

What are we switching to now, guys? TeamSpeak? Ventrilo? Skype? ICQ?

The only platform to not require a bloody phone to make an account when people were leaving skype because it became too bad.

I don&#39;t get it. Discord is a fine app for chatting, but it&#39;s really no better than any other similar app. It&#39;s free, which makes profitability difficult. Their attempt at offering games was a complete flop. They make most of their money with &quot;Nitro&quot;, which let&#39;s you do things like put fancy icons on your profile. Gee, whiz, wow.

Agree on most points. I&#39;d love to see actual revenue from Nitro stuff, though. I&#39;m sure if they charged a subscription to be a mod, though, a lot of sad people would pay up just for that privilege.

On Monday, Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro and his wife Cilia Adela Flores de Maduro were arraigned in a federal courthouse in New York City on charges of drug trafficking, continuing what has been a stunning first few days of 2026. The criminal proceedings—and likely trial—ahead are sure to be rocky and closely watched around the world. How exactly, though, will the Justice Department’s charges against the Maduros play in a court of law? We talked to an expert to find out.

“This is not a trumped-up case. This appears to be a real solid indictment,” Adam Pollock, a former assistant attorney general of New York and now a managing partner of the law firm Pollock Cohen, told me. Pollock believes the U.S. government has built an impressive case against the Maduros, with the indictment suggesting there are cooperating witnesses, recordings of drug deals, and direct links between the Maduros and Venezuelan drug-trafficking networks.

Still, the disturbing and complex facts of the Maduros’ arrest—during an apparently illegal military raid of the country Maduro was leading—makes this case anything but a slam dunk. While entering a plea of not guilty on Monday, the Venezuelan leader told the court that he had been “kidnapped.” “I am innocent. I’m a decent man,” Maduro said during his arraignment. The couple did not seek bail, and were transferred to a New York City jail. Their next court hearing is on March 17.

What comes next? What are all of the charges the indictment makes? What kind of defense could the Maduros use? I spoke with Pollock to get some answers to these questions and to understand the full breadth of the DOJ’s indictment. Our conversation has been edited and condensed for clarity.

Shirin Ali: After reading the entire indictment, how strong of a case do you think the DOJ has here against the Maduros?

Adam Pollock: This is a really robust indictment. You’re dealing with the Southern District of New York, the United States Attorney’s Office, which is a really serious office that doesn’t bring trumped-up political charges. If you compare this to the indictments of James Comey or Letitia James, that were super stamped-on details, very bare-bones, hard to know what the charges were. Why? Because those were vindictive political prosecutions. Here, we have a robust indictment full of detail, meetings, descriptions of events, and going back for, I think, almost two decades. And how do you get this information? You typically have to have either wiretaps or recording in the rooms, or what appears to be the case here is a witness who is cooperating.

There are quite a bit of allegations of actual meetings, payments, and involvement of the Maduros. This does not appear to be a case of him and his wife sitting up at the top of government and turning a blind eye to drug trafficking. To the contrary, there actually seems to be direct involvement.

Let’s start with Count 2, cocaine importation conspiracy. I was a little bit surprised here, because the State Department estimated 200 to 250 tons of cocaine were trafficked through Venezuela annually. That’s a lot of cocaine, but doesn’t strike me as a giant number. In general, the United States has had a long-held view that if you commit a crime abroad that affects Americans, then you’re subject to our jurisdiction. You can think about that in many areas, not just drugs, but financial crimes or child abuse. You can think of many areas where merely sitting abroad is not going to immunize you from the reach of American prosecution. And certainly we’ve had a long-held view that drug trafficking that affects Americans is subject to American jurisdiction. So that’s Count 2.

With Count 1, narcoterrorism conspiracy, basically what they are talking about is that the Maduro government apparently supported these rebel groups in Colombia, the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Columbia and the National Liberation Army. Those are designated terrorist groups within the United States, and it is long-standing American policy to oppose those groups and designate them as terrorists. The indictment is saying that the Maduro government supported them through helping them with drug trafficking. Count 3, possession of machine guns, sort of collapses back on itself and also gets to the question everyone’s asking: Is it lawful to arrest the sitting president of a country? Traditionally, there’s been a view in international law that it is not, and certainly that is a defense that Maduro will raise pretrial. In that trial, the United States is going to say that he was not the legitimate leader for two reasons. First, they’ll say Maduro was illegitimate because he was a drug trafficker—that is kind of a tautological argument, but it’s one that will be made. Second, they will say he stole the last two elections.

Is it lawful for heads of states to have armies that have machine guns? Probably. But if they’re really not legitimate heads of states, but actually drug traffickers, and they’re using those machine guns as part of a drug conspiracy, then that adds on as a charge. And then the last charge is the conspiracy to possess machine guns and destructive devices, which is effectively, the same thing.

The indictment also charges Maduro’s son, Nicolás Ernesto Maduro Guerra; two Venezuelan government officials; and a leader of Tren de Aragua, the Venezuelan transnational gang, as part of this narcoterrorism conspiracy. What exactly happens to them now?

Now you start to intersect politics with prosecution. Clearly there was a political motive to bring a large Army force to arrest Maduro and his wife. You don’t expect that a similar military operation would be mounted to arrest the other defendants. Instead, they’ll now lead a more constrained life, where they’ll need to be concerned that, if there’s a change of government, whether they’ll be continued to be protected if they travel abroad and where they can travel to. Life as an indicted felon is harsh, even if you’re abroad; you can kind of continue to live in sanctuary in Venezuela until the government changes. But eventually, there’s going to be a government, whether it’s next month or next year or next decade, that’s more friendly to the United States, and the United States will pressure that government to hand over the suspects.

Numerous times throughout the indictment, the DOJ references that the alleged crimes were committed as far back as 1999. Is there a statute of limitations the U.S. government has to work within? What should we make of this?

I noticed that, but the answer is not particularly anything to note, for two reasons. One is they’re going to argue that it’s an ongoing conspiracy. And second, even if they were unsuccessful in arguing that, they still have enough overt acts of the conspiracy within the statute limitation over the last five or six years.

What strategy do you think the prosecution will take and how do you expect the Maduros to defend themselves?

The latter is slightly more interesting, which is clearly the Maduros will argue that he should receive head-of-state immunity. They might argue that he was illegally kidnapped from Venezuela, but that’s a loser argument because the Supreme Court has been very clear since at least 1886. There is a case called Ker v. Illinois where the defendant was forcibly kidnapped from Peru and brought out to a U.S. Navy ship and then brought back to the United States for prosecution—sounds kind of familiar. The Supreme Court basically said that they’re not going to concern themselves with how the defendant reached the United States’ shores; as long as they’re here, they can be prosecuted. This Supreme Court has reaffirmed that time and time again. So can Maduro make that argument? Sure, but it’s going to lose. I think that he’ll have stronger grounds for making the head-of-state immunity argument, which is interesting when you consider ultimately how far can that argument take you. I guess to the Supreme Court, but what’s this conservative Supreme Court going to do with that? I wouldn’t expect great results for Maduro on that.

I think his best possible strategy is to challenge the evidence at trial. You’ve got to wonder; putting together a criminal drug-trafficking conspiracy case in Venezuela is a technically hard case to put together. They’ve got one cooperator, but you can cross-examine the cooperator, who’s cooperating in hopes of a more lenient sentence. Sounds like the prosecution has some recordings, and you can guess that they probably have some electronic intercepts, but my guess is that kind of old-fashioned trial defense is going to be their strategy here. Now, the prosecution strategy is the converse of that, which is roll up your sleeves and put on the evidence in the way that you would with any other drug conspiracy.

What happens next? How quickly do you foresee this case moving forward?

Not that long, although it depends a whole heck of a lot on how much evidence the government has collected. You’ll start to see that on the docket as the government makes disclosures of evidence to the defendants, known as discovery disclosures. There are cases where there are millions of pages and the defendant needs significant time to review millions of pages of emails, text messages, and listen to hundreds of hours of wiretaps. I suspect that this case is going to be light on paper, emails, and text messages, and my guess is there are not a ton of recordings, because it’s a bit more technologically challenging to get recordings in the room in drug deals in Venezuela. I think that this could be a case with relatively light evidence discovery, in which case you might see this go to trial within a year or so.

South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham has a hard-earned skip in his step. After nearly a decade of obsequious, showy servility to the president he once warned would be the death knell of the Republican Party, Graham is getting what he wants: an interventionist Republican president merrily drawing up a list of baddies to take down, starting with captured Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro.

Graham was one of the first to recognize, long ago, that Donald Trump’s policy views are determined mostly by the flattery of the last person to speak with him before a decision. For both of Trump’s presidencies, Graham has worked to flatter Trump at every turn, and to be the final person to do so. While Graham has his hands in a lot of policy jars, his passion is an interventionist foreign policy. That’s led to an ever-running proxy battle for Trump’s sympathies between himself and an ascendant noninterventionist “America First” foreign policy wing, as best represented in the Senate by Kentucky’s Rand Paul.

Graham couldn’t contain his glee on Sunday aboard Air Force One as he stood inches from Trump, shortly after the Venezuela operation.

The president was rattling through a list of countries in the Americas that would go down next. Mexico? “You have to do something with Mexico.” What about a mission in Colombia? “It sounds good to me.” And as for the big, bad hemispheric archnemesis of 70 years Cuba: “Looks like it’s ready for fall.”

“Yes!” Graham said, beaming with the glow of someone whose life had been leading to this very moment.

Aboard Air Force One, in his own remarks—which the president frequently interrupted with stray thoughts about how, for example, he would’ve taken out bin Laden before 9/11—Graham laid it on extra thick.

“We had Venezuela, we have Cuba, we have Colombia in our backyard. And these three countries have been condemned ever since I’ve been in politics,” Graham said. “Joe Biden put a $25 million bounty on Maduro’s head.” And “this commander in chief,” he added, “he did something people talked about doing.”

Graham isn’t just thinking about the “backyard” (a whole hemisphere), though. Also on Sunday—the senator was everywhere on Sunday—he appeared on Fox News with a message for another, more distant regime that he has long believed in changing. And he brought a prop.

“I pray and hope that 2026 will be”—here he paused to put on a baseball cap bearing the slogan he would then utter—“the year that we make Iran great again.”

Graham has been waiting for a moment like this for a while, ever since the failures of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars soured the public on the wisdom of nation-building. For a long time, Graham hitched his wagon to the celebrity of his friend and fellow hawk John McCain. Since McCain’s death, and with the rise of an isolationist element in the MAGA movement, Graham has been trying to work Trump in his direction. The kidnapping of one hostile foreign leader is, for Graham, a good start.

But not all is joyous in the Senate Republican conference. Just as much as Graham might sound as if he’s won the long fight for Trump’s foreign-policy orientation, Rand Paul is sounding as if he’s lost.

Paul reflected on Trump’s tenure Monday, speaking with reporters.

“Whenever I had misgivings about something else, I’d always come back and say, ‘Well, he’s the best we’ve ever had,’ much better than the Bushes, who were war-mad and wanted to be involved in all these crazy wars overseas and were going to make the world safe for democracy—I never liked any of that,” he said. “And I thought Trump was different. And so it disappoints me that he’s under the thrall of Lindsey Graham.

“There should be a law,” Paul continued, “that Lindsey Graham can only go to the White House every other week.”

How much credit does Graham give himself for persuading Trump to move in a more interventionist direction? I asked Graham this on Tuesday. He was smart enough not to bite, awarding credit for all critical thinking to the president.

“I’m just reinforcing what he told me in January 2025,” he said. “I had a talk with him. We have a drug caliphate in our backyard—look at it as a caliphate. Instead of complaining about it, let’s get rid of it. These are not, you know, unbeatable foes. And I think the American people would appreciate somebody finally stopping those who are poisoning Americans and making billions of dollars.” (Also: Get rid of Iran.)

Both Graham and Paul had throngs of reporters following them in the Capitol Tuesday, getting their sides of the long-running foreign-policy feud that had now swung dramatically in one direction. Paul was talking on the level of legality, and about how the administration’s arguments that Maduro’s capture was a law-enforcement operation, and thus not a military operation requiring congressional input, made no sense.

“If you say that we don’t have to declare war because this is a criminal” case, he told reporters, “it would basically be an argument you could go to any country where you had a beef, that you could get an indictment for them” and run a military operation to decapitate the state.

Rand Paul might have the law, but Lindsey Graham has Trump. I asked Graham if he felt that he had won the battle against Paul in favor of interventionism. Graham took issue with the term itself.

“This is not intervention,” he said. “This is protecting America. It’s not like ‘Hey, what are you doing today? Let’s go to Venezuela. Seems like nice beaches, good-looking people. Let’s take it.’ This is protecting America from threat.”

“Rand Paul”—he paused for a second and ever so slightly rolled his eyes, considering his words—“doesn’t believe that radical Islam is a threat. He would withdraw, he’d be America Fortress, America Fortress. There’d be no troops anywhere. Trump wants to protect the country.

“America First,” he summed it up, “is taking countries that hurt America and change them. Interventionism is going somewhere without a real good reason.”

That’s his story, and he’s sticking to it.

Since the demise of Roe v. Wade, red-state lawmakers have been looking for political cover for unpopular criminal abortion bans, and a simple strategy has emerged: stressing that bans in theory afford access in exceptional cases that voters overwhelmingly support, such as medical emergencies. The goal of this maneuver is straightforward. For voters who are conflicted about abortion, a focus on exceptions makes bans moderate and reasonable. But a major decision on Tuesday by the Wyoming Supreme Court striking down the state’s abortion ban suggests that abortion exceptions are fast becoming a Catch-22 for the GOP—a potential political lifeline that can create real trouble in court.

To appreciate why abortion exceptions can create legal headaches for Republicans, it helps to understand the Wyoming litigation. A group of patients, doctors, and advocates challenged the constitutionality of the state’s abortion bans under Article 1, Section 38 of the Wyoming Constitution, passed as part of the backlash to President Barack Obama’s Affordable Care Act. The amendment recognizes a right to make health care decisions. The plaintiffs argued that this right was fundamental and encompassed people’s decision to terminate a pregnancy. The state responded that abortion wasn’t health care—it was the intentional taking of human life—and that even if abortion were health care, the state’s interest in protecting prenatal life was enough to justify its ban. This focus on protecting life made strategic sense; all five justices on the Wyoming Supreme Court were appointed by Republicans, and polls suggest that even Americans who support legal abortion think fetal life has value, despite their opposition to the sweeping criminalization of decisions about pregnancy.

That’s where the plaintiffs pointed to the state law’s abortion exceptions: If the state really valued protecting fetal life, and if abortion wasn’t health care, the plaintiffs argued, these specific exceptions were a funny way of showing it.

Take the state’s exceptions for fatal fetal abnormalities, which apply only if a physician expects that a newborn’s death will occur within days of a live birth. The court asked how this exception made any sense. How did the state protect life by making women in other cases when death of the newborn was just as certain—but who had a longer timeline to sit with that doomed outcome—carry their pregnancies to term? Given that pregnancy could pose risks to abortion seekers, the justices thought the fetal-abnormality exception threatened patients’ health without advancing the state’s supposed goals.

The same was true of Wyoming’s exceptions for medical emergencies, which explicitly excluded mental health crises, such as depression or psychosis, during pregnancy. The state presented no evidence that mental health wasn’t an issue during pregnancy—and no wonder: Mental health conditions accompany a significant number of pregnancies and can lead to seriously adverse outcomes.

Even the state’s rape and incest exception was a problem. The court’s justices didn’t see any connection between the state’s supposed goal of protecting all life in the womb and allowing abortions in cases of sexual abuse, and neither should anyone else. If the state believes that life or even rights begin at fertilization, it’s hard to comprehend why that wouldn’t be true in instances of sexual assault too.

That Wyoming’s abortion exceptions were weird and incoherent shouldn’t be a great surprise. In recent years, any abortion-ban exception reflects an inherently odd compromise between the demands of anti-abortion lobbyists and the electoral needs of GOP lawmakers. Republicans want to win election. That requires keeping a lid on the most heartbreaking stories, narratives that can shape the vote well outside the state where a tragedy has occurred. Abortion opponents want as many abortions as possible stopped, with the exception of a vanishingly small number of serious threats to life.

Conservative lawmakers thus propose exceptions to make abortion bans seem less harsh. Exceptions, ultimately, are a mere messaging strategy, one that undermines the legal case for abortion bans.

That’s reflected in the oddball design of many exceptions. Medical-emergency exceptions, for example, are meant not so much to give physicians real discretion in addressing urgent conditions as to rule out certain cases (such as threats to mental health) that abortion foes dismiss as “abortion on demand.” Rape-and-incest exceptions, like Wyoming’s, often contain reporting requirements intended to ferret out patients who “cry rape,” a solution in search of a problem in a culture in which sexual violence is massively underreported and rarely prosecuted. In a big-picture sense, exceptions are intended to broadcast that abortion bans are far less harsh than they appear, but on closer examination, they’re designed as much to reassure conservative lawmakers that people won’t be able to get abortions anyway.

And exceptions don’t work—by design. Historically, very few patients have sought out abortions under exceptions. That trend has continued—so much so that red states like Texas and Kentucky have passed laws said to clarify that some abortions are justified under state law. That state of affairs suits conservative lawmakers, who seek the political benefits of exceptions with none of the real abortion access they might afford.

The Wyoming Supreme Court’s ruling in State v. Johnson sends a message that this have-it-both-ways strategy on exceptions won’t always work as Republicans expect. The court saw the very same inconsistencies of exceptions as a sign that they didn’t deliver on the state’s purported goals.

It’s not clear what will come next in fights about abortion exceptions. More challenges like Johnson might come before state supreme courts, given that a number of conservative states, including Oklahoma, Ohio, Alabama, and Florida, have similar health amendments in their constitutions. But Republicans are doubling down on exceptions as a strategy: In Missouri, for example, voters will decide on whether to repeal a reproductive rights amendment passed in 2024. GOP lawmakers have tried to package the repeal amendment as allowing abortion in exceptional cases, like medical emergencies.

Republicans may think this strategy is working; some polls suggest that supporters of abortion rights are less passionate about the issue than they once were. That likely has much more to do with conservatives’ struggles to enforce abortion bans—abortion seems more, not less, common in many ban states since the fall of Roe—than with exceptions. But even when voters are willing not to look hard at what an exception really says and does, the Wyoming decision shows that the same might not be true of courts.

The Trump administration’s justifications for bombing Venezuela and arresting its president shifted in real time this weekend. Was this a national security–related counternarcotics operation, an oil heist, or a regime-change play to topple a dictator?

That lack of clarity—combined with the administration’s propensity to, well, tell a lot of lies—only added to the mass confusion over what’s really going on. After all, Donald Trump’s Venezuela adventure isn’t an isolated incident, and it’s best understood in proper historical context: the long tail of U.S. intervention in Latin America.

To help make sense of what just happened, and to get answers on what might happen next, I turned to Tiziano Breda. He’s a senior analyst covering Latin America and the Caribbean at ACLED, the independent conflict-monitoring organization that tracks political violence and protests worldwide. Breda has spent more than a decade studying Latin American politics and security.

In our conversation, he unpacks how this operation fits into the long arc of U.S. intervention in the region, the internal dynamics of Venezuela’s ruling “Chavista” coalition, the role of oil, and why the most dangerous consequence of this moment may not be what happens next in Caracas, but what it signals across the world. Our conversation has been edited and condensed for clarity.

Aymann Ismail: There’s so much in flux right now. What are the most important things we still don’t know about what’s happening between the United States and Venezuela?

Tiziano Breda: There are at least three variables that remain unclear. The first is how this will play out inside Venezuela now that Maduro has been removed. What has this generated within the Chavista power structure—in the government, the military, and across different sectors of society? What comes next depends on factors like whether Delcy Rodríguez [Venezuela’s acting president] can ensure continuity for the Chavistas while at the same time becoming somewhat more lenient toward U.S. interests.

The second is how this strike is being received in the United States. There has been backlash from Congress. The Trump administration has framed it as a law enforcement operation, but lawmakers say they were bypassed and are questioning the legality of the operation. The key question is how this lands with a Trump support base that is, in principle, uninterested in foreign interventions.

And third, at the international level, it’s still unclear how other major powers are interpreting this—whether they oppose it or see an opportunity. For countries like Russia and China, the question is whether this represents the loss of an ally, a precedent that could be applied in their own spheres of influence. For China in particular, it would mean not recovering the billions of dollars it still has as credit with Venezuela.

This didn’t come out of nowhere. There were months of escalating tensions. How does this moment fit into the longer U.S.–Venezuela standoff? Were you surprised when Trump announced the U.S. captured Maduro?

When Trump took office, his administration was mostly focused on immigration. Marco Rubio struggled with Richard Grenell over whose voice would be more influential in the White House on Venezuela. For the first few months Grenell seemed to have the upper hand: There were prisoner exchanges, deportation flights, Chevron’s license was renewed. But in 2025, Rubio established himself as a key strategic adviser on Venezuela. There was a noticeable shift: military buildup in the Caribbean, harsher rhetoric and labeling organized crime groups as terrorist organizations, allegations tying Maduro to some of them.

That framing was used to justify strikes against suspected drug-trafficking vessels—at least 34 so far with over 110 confirmed fatalities—not only in the Caribbean, but also in the Pacific. When that didn’t produce cracks within Maduro’s administration, we saw an escalation: oil tankers seized or chased, and a blockade on Venezuelan oil. That caused much more damage to the Maduro government’s ability to keep revenues afloat, yet there were still no cracks in Maduro’s network of alliances. So Trump was left with two options: either back down and strike some kind of deal or escalate. There had already been a CIA strike in late December, but I did not expect an operation of this kind.

The U.N. has already said this violates international law. Is there any real ambiguity here?

I’m not an expert on international law, but it’s my understanding that the U.S. does have the right to try someone in the United States for crimes that may have affected the U.S., such as drug trafficking. Thousands of drug traffickers have gone through this process. But I’m much less sure that this means the U.S. has the authority to go and extract Maduro from another country. Usually, the United States would request the extradition of a person believed to have committed a crime in the U.S. I’d say there are serious deficiencies in the legality of the operation.

The closest precedent, at least in Latin America, is the U.S. invasion of Panama in 1989, to capture and extract President Noriega on drug-trafficking charges. That operation was on a much larger scale and far more costly in terms of lives, duration, and scope. But it occurred in the context of the Cold War—a moment in history that preceded the era of multilateralism, international governance, and the development of international human rights norms. I’m concerned, seeing a return of this practice in 2026. It suggests much of what was built after that period is now unraveling, or being dismantled by the United States.

So what does the future of Venezuela look like? Rodríguez seems to be in control. Rubio is saying that she’s illegitimate. Do you see regime change on the horizon? Not in the short term, unless Rodríguez is unable to do two things. She needs to avoid taking a confrontational stance toward the United States, and instead strike deals and make concessions in the oil sector. Simultaneously, she needs to project an image of someone who remains loyal to Chavismo principles—respect for national sovereignty, resistance to excessive U.S. imperial practices, and so on. If she manages this balancing act, avoiding further U.S. strikes while preventing fractures within the Chavista ranks—both in the military and in social networks—Venezuela can stabilize in the short term. But if either of these fails, I think more violence is likely.

The United States has declared they intend to run the country. How will that complicate Rodríguez’s ability to stabilize Venezuela?

The U.S. is looking to ensure that this removal leads to more functional agreements with the Venezuelan government—guaranteeing U.S. companies can get in more freely, invest, settle, and sell all the oil they can pump. A full-fledged regime change does not seem to be the main goal of the Trump administration in the short term. They are aware that the [Venezuelan, anti-Maduro] opposition may have popular support, but they do not have the buy-in of the military in particular. Installing a government without military support would carry the risk of throwing the country into chaos.

Is there something about the way that the Venezuelan government is set up that will make it particularly challenging for Rodríguez to consolidate?

Like all governments and political forces, the Maduro government—the Chavistas—has its own internal currents and branches. Maduro, and particularly Cilia Flores, are relevant here. Their removal matters because Maduro and Cilia Flores had managed to pacify the different factions within Chavismo and build a system in which elites could extract wealth from Venezuela.

For example, the military benefited from revenues from the gold-mining sector. The security sector, some would say, participated in illegal drug trafficking, and of course benefited from oil and shipping. There was a balance, and wealth was distributed among military, economic, and political elites in a way that kept the system stable. Rodríguez may try to replicate this, but she will be dealing with a very different level of U.S. pressure than Maduro faced. There may also be Maduro loyalists who obstruct her government. So even if the overall architecture remains in place, simply replacing the person at the top will have repercussions across the entire government.

What role does oil actually play in all of this? I look at a country like Saudi Arabia and think, Wow, they got lucky they have so much oil. Why was this not necessarily possible for a place like Venezuela?

The key difference between Maduro and Chávez is that Maduro politicized the oil sector too heavily. When Chávez was in power, Venezuela benefited from a boom in energy prices in the mid-2000s. He also appointed people with technical expertise to manage the oil sector. When Maduro came to power in 2013, in a quest to consolidate his authority, he replaced almost all the Chavistas he didn’t trust—including the minister of oil—and replaced them with loyalists who lacked knowledge of the sector. That lack of understanding began to create problems with maintenance, delays, production failures, and so on.

Then you had the plummeting of oil prices about 10 years ago, which hurt Venezuela’s revenue. Even before the U.S. sanctioned the oil sector in 2019, under the first Trump administration, the sector was already collapsing due to corruption and overall mismanagement. They could still maintain significant production—almost a million barrels a day—but that was down from 3 million about 15 years earlier. With that, they had enough money to sustain the elites, but the rest of society and the broader economy collapsed. That’s why you had around 8 million Venezuelans fleeing the country, as the government itself remained intact.

Up until last week, Nicolas Maduro was challenging the United States to invade, publishing videos of his military conducting drills. I know a little bit about his background, that he was originally a bus driver. What can you tell me about his character?

The role of Cilia Flores [Maduro’s wife, who was also arrested] is often overlooked. Some people refer to her as the power in the shadows, operating behind the scenes. Maduro did not reach his position alone. Flores was a key figure in liaising with the different branches of the Chavismo project. She has been head of the National Assembly, a deputy, and a minister. Her political trajectory was similar to Maduro’s, even though it was Maduro who was appointed by Chávez as his political heir. Maduro relied heavily on Cilia Flores, who played a key role in holding his government together.

Maduro also made use of humor and self-parody as a political tactic. He presents himself as a funny, silly, good guy. He even created a cartoon version of himself called “Súper Bigote,” or “Super Mustache.” I can’t think of another leader who has leaned so heavily into laughing at himself. He uses that strategy to conceal the authoritarian nature of his government, to soften accusations of massive human rights violations, suppression of dissent, waves of political arrests, extrajudicial killings, and so on.

And then you see the images of him being detained in the United States. He has a big grin, giving two thumbs up. What explains that?

There was also an attempt to keep the character going, to play on the empathy of the audience, watching a guy who, in another context, might greet you with a thumbs-up and say “Happy New Year.” He appears certain of his innocence, as though he believes he will be released once the truth comes out. While the aim of the United States might have been to show that a man who had been in power since 2013—so for over a decade—who had seemed untouchable was being brought down to the level of a common criminal.

I haven’t seen much from inside Venezuela. How are Venezuelans reacting inside the country?

At ACLED, we have so far recorded only two protests inside Venezuela, and both were in favor of Maduro. It’s not only that there are no protests, there has also been a decrease in traffic and economic activity over the past couple of days. Inside the country, the government has imposed a state of emergency and deployed military forces to the streets, which has disincentivized mobilization. Uncertainty is also playing a key role. There have been mixed messages coming from the United States—the sidelining of María Corina Machado [prominent opposition leader and recipient of the 2025 Nobel Peace Prize], the attempt to reach an agreement with Rodríguez, who is part of the same system as Maduro, and the broader fear that if this doesn’t work out, it could trigger chaos within the Chavista ranks and lead to violence. So I think people are avoiding the public sphere.

And what about abroad? How are Venezuelans in the diaspora reacting to this?

The vast majority of Venezuelans abroad have celebrated Maduro’s removal from power, though not as many agree with the way it happened through the bombing of Caracas. Most Venezuelans who have fled the country in recent years did so either because of political persecution or because of the economic collapse caused by the Maduro administration.

It’s strange to see people celebrating the bombing of their own country.

It is. But it’s a testament to the level of discontent and anger toward an administration that has effectively dismantled the country’s economy. Twenty years ago, Venezuela was the wealthiest country in South America. Today, roughly a quarter of the population has been forced to leave because the economy collapsed. The relief—if not outright celebration—among many Venezuelans reflects that deep discontent with the Maduro administration.

How are other leaders and peoples in Latin America reacting to this?

There has been a mixed reaction. Leftist governments like Brazil, Colombia, and Mexico have strongly condemned the U.S. action. On the other hand, more right-wing governments like Argentina, Ecuador, and the newly elected president of Honduras have been more supportive, and in some cases even enthusiastic about the operation. The divisions have been quite clear along ideological lines.

For people particularly in countries that have been most affected by the influx of Venezuelan migrants and refugees—Peru, Ecuador, Colombia, and Chile—the arrival of Venezuelans has strained public resources, and in some cases it has been instrumentalized by xenophobic political figures, creating a stigma.

Maduro is widely perceived as the main cause of Venezuelan migration and is deeply unpopular. There was polling showing that, across Latin America, and particularly in the countries most affected by Venezuelan migration, many people were already in favor of major intervention in Venezuela, even before this happened.

The U.S. seems to be configuring the reasoning for capturing Maduro in real time, offering conflicting information. What do you think is really driving the U.S. here, and what’s bullshit?

There are three reasons. First, reasserting U.S. dominance in the hemisphere, especially actors seen as being in cahoots with the U.S.’s main global competitors, Russia and China. Second, widening U.S. access to energy and other resources. Venezuela is rich in gas, minerals, and gold, and expanding U.S. access to those sectors is strategically important for the American economy. Third is migration. Hundreds of thousands of Venezuelans live in the United States, and millions more across the region. By removing what is perceived to be the country’s main problem—Maduro—and projecting the image that the U.S. will now invest in Venezuela, the administration is trying to create a picture that things have improved and encourage Venezuelans living in the U.S. without legal status to return.

The BS part is drug trafficking, which is paradoxically the legal rationale being used to bring Maduro to justice. He’s being charged with drug trafficking, terrorism, and weapons offenses. But the narrative that Maduro himself is a central drug-trafficking threat—and that attacks on drug vessels or even Maduro’s trial will significantly reduce the flow of drugs to the U.S. or elsewhere—doesn’t really hold up.

This is a return to a more assertive U.S. approach toward Latin America. It’s something that had waned over the years and been replaced by a greater emphasis on regional cooperation through institutions like the Organization of American States, and by U.S. soft power projected through development projects. This attack marks a clear end to that era and a return to one in which the United States is willing to use its full power—economic, diplomatic, and military—to ensure that its preferences materialize in the region. It’s somewhat anachronistic, but it’s a renewed version of the Monroe Doctrine, which held that the U.S. has a responsibility to influence and direct political, economic, and military developments in the hemisphere, and to keep external forces from undermining its interests.

Does the speed at which Donald Trump pivoted to Greenland and Mexico reveal anything about how he might be thinking about Venezuela?

Trump may feel emboldened because it has cost the United States little in terms of human lives and equipment, which he emphasized repeatedly during his press conference on Saturday. Let’s see what the U.N. Security Council says and what comes next, but for now the international cost also appears limited. Whether more action happens in the immediate future will depend on how the situation in Venezuela unfolds. If it triggers domestic turmoil, violence between different factions of Chavismo, or broader social unrest, then it becomes less likely that this approach would be applied elsewhere. Paradoxically, if it works, there is a risk that it could be repeated in other contexts.

            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2026/01/07/datacenter_tax_breaks_virginia/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The US state of Virginia forfeited $1.6 billion in tax revenue through datacenter exemptions in fiscal 2025 – up 118 percent on the prior year – as the AI-driven construction boom accelerates.

Good Jobs First, a nonprofit promoting corporate and government accountability, warns these incentives have become essentially automatic.

Virginia&#39;s qualification threshold requires just $150 million in capital investment and 50 new jobs, which is modest compared to the billions spent on today&#39;s hyperscale facilities. The exemptions cover retail sales and use taxes on computer equipment, software, and hardware purchases.

The disclosure is detailed in Virginia&#39;s Annual Comprehensive Financial Report [PDF], which covers the fiscal year ended June 30, 2025.

Good Jobs First claims the tax breaks are getting out of hand as the criteria to become a qualifying recipient are set at a low bar.

Greg LeRoy, executive director at the nonprofit, said: &quot;Like 35 other states, Virginia is losing control of its spending by enacting virtually automatic sales and use tax exemptions, and sometimes other subsidies, for datacenter building materials and equipment.&quot;

Recipients may qualify for local property tax reductions on top, he added.

Virginia has the highest datacenter count globally – more than 600 according to some estimates – equating to more than 10 percent of estimated global hyperscale capacity.

The Register has asked the government of Virginia to comment.

Good Jobs First highlighted last year that more than half of US states offer economic development subsidies for datacenters exempting them from sales and use taxes.

LeRoy argues these breaks should end: &quot;Given that every state that has studied its return on investment for datacenter subsidies has found a sharply negative result, we recommend that states now eliminate all datacenter tax exemptions.

&quot;Trillion-dollar internet giants don&#39;t need the tax breaks, and taxpayers cannot afford them with massive federal budget cuts coming.&quot;

Meanwhile, grassroots opposition to the datacenter construction frenzy is mounting. The Washington Post reported this week on public campaigns in Arizona, Indiana, and Maryland challenging new facilities over water and electricity consumption and their visual impact on rural landscapes.

In December, Democrat senators were questioned datacenter companies about rising energy bills driven by grid infrastructure costs often passed to consumers, while Senator Bernie Sanders called for a nationwide construction moratorium. ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Opinion Ever since Linux got a graphical desktop, you could middle-click to paste – but if GNOME gets its way, that&#39;s going away soon, and from Firefox too.

More proof, if you will, that the traditional keyboard and multi-button mouse config is boring legacy tech to the hipsters in charge these days. GNOME developer Jordan Petridis has submitted the code to remove middle-click paste behavior from GNOME defaults, which he considers &quot;an X11ism.&quot; The merge request concludes &quot;Goodbye X11.&quot;

It&#39;s not just in GNOME – he&#39;s additionally filed bug 1747207 against Firefox, also proposing to remove this behavior. There, he says:

This is a little known feature and behavior that leads into user confusion when they click the middle mouse button without knowing about its functionality. Most of the time, its [sic] also clicked by accident, and its [sic] very weird o [sic] have the clipboard dumped on such occasions.

The feature is also not discoverable at all, and even on the Freedesktop wiki page, the entirity [sic] of the &quot;PRIMARY&quot; selection is refferred [sic] to as an &quot;easter egg&quot;.

The spelling and punctuation errors are in the original, but they aren&#39;t the only mistake: it doesn&#39;t dump the clipboard. The clipboard is a separate thing. Middle-clicking pastes any currently selected text at the insertion point, including in a terminal emulator, without affecting the clipboard. That&#39;s why we like it. For instance, you can select and copy the title of a webpage, then select the URL, then switch to another window, paste the title with Ctrl+V, and then paste the URL with a middle-click, without two round trips between the apps.

There is one element of truth to this proposal, though. Middle-click to paste is not as well-known as it should be, which is why we wrote about how to use the middle button in 2023.

However, this is a very long-standing feature. Linux.com published an article about using it in 2004. A 2005 Mozilla bug says: &quot;Middle-click paste is the default behavior on Unix systems.&quot; The Reg FOSS desk discovered it in his first experiments with Linux 30 years ago, on the Lasermoon Linux/FT distro – the first POSIX.1 certified Linux.

Before Linux, it was in SunOS – it&#39;s mentioned in the docs for the IRAF tool from 1995. We suspect that, as per this Stack Overflow answer, it predates the X window system and may go back to SunView, released in 1985, which also crops up in the FreeBSD docs.

This is ancient Unix technology, inherited from systems released when this vulture was still in school. We like it a great deal, and badly miss it on macOS, as well as on Windows, where as we noted in 2022 even the excellent Taekwindow can&#39;t help. Taekwindow does bring another handy Linux use of the middle button to Windows: middle-click the title bar of any window to put it behind all the other windows, and other window-management improvements – but sadly, that&#39;s all. GNOME&#39;s growing use of &quot;client side decorations&quot; instead of proper title bars already broke the handy send-to-back feature years ago.

Call us paranoid, but we feel attacked. Once again, it feels to us very much like the GNOME developers – quite a few of whom are relative youngsters – simply don&#39;t know how to make the best use of what are apparently old-fashioned input devices like multi-button mice. As a result, they see useful facilities as unnecessary, and want to take them away from those of us who value them.

We implore the GNOME team: please, spend a weekend on a Windows desktop PC with no pointing device and learn to drive it with the keyboard alone. Start with a blank installation of Win 10 LTSC, use Ninite to install a bunch of FOSS apps. Configure Firefox and Thunderbird for keyboard use. It&#39;s like Vim but for the entire OS. It is so fast and efficient and capable, you will feel as if you are a god-like superhero of computing. You&#39;ll be amazed. You&#39;ll pick up skills you&#39;ll be able to use every day for the rest of your life, and it&#39;s fun. Please. Just try it. And then maybe you will see why we object to you removing these facilities.

We suspect that Petridis will have scornful words for this article. In an earlier blog post, Rust in Peace, he mentions:

There has been a lot of concerned trolling and misinformation specifically around this topic sadly from people that don&#39;t care about it and have been abusing the discourse as a straw man argument.

We suspect, from some comments on Mastodon and other places, that this comment refers personally to this vulture and his accessibility advocacy. For instance, our story on Apple accessibility in 2025 along with previous criticisms of Linux accessibility. ®

            <h2>Earlier Horizon rollout could widen net for quashed Post Office convictions</h2>
            <p><strong>The Register | 2026-01-07</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2026/01/07/post_office_horizon_rollout/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The Post Office&#39;s Horizon computer system may have been deployed earlier than thought, potentially affecting which convictions get automatically quashed under legislation introduced to speed up justice in one of the biggest scandals in recent British history, MPs heard yesterday.

Amanda Pearce, casework operations director at the Criminal Cases Review Commission (CCRC) - an independent public body that reviews possible miscarriages of justice - told the Commons Business and Trade Committee that new Post Office information suggested Horizon was installed earlier than originally believed.

This could mean some convictions previously thought to predate the system may now qualify for automatic quashing under the Post Office (Horizon System) Offences Act 2024.

Pearce told MPs she was investigating possible miscarriages of justice under computer systems prior to Horizon&#39;s introduction, but the Post Office continued to provide new details.

&quot;We&#39;ve recently had the information on one of the pre-Horizon cases, which suggests that, in fact, Horizon was installed earlier than had originally been thought, and that case may be one that benefits from the Horizon legislation. It&#39;s complex to try and pin down the information in these cases,&quot; she told MPs.

Horizon is an EPOS and back-end finance system that was first implemented by ICL, a UK tech firm majority-owned by Fujitsu in the 1990s and fully acquired in 1998. It has undergone two subsequent upgrades.

From 1999 until 2015, around 736 subpostmasters were wrongfully prosecuted and convicted over Horizon errors, devastating lives in the process. A statutory inquiry into the mass miscarriage of justice launched in 2021 and is ongoing.

Its first report found that senior Post Office staff in the UK – and those working for suppliers Fujitsu and ICL – knew or should have known about the defects causing errors in the Horizon system. It also found that 13 suicides were recorded, most likely linked to the Post Office prosecutions, in which Fujitsu provided technical support.

The Post Office (Horizon System) Offences Act 2024 was introduced to fulfill the commitment made by then Prime Minister Rishi Sunak in January 2024 to quash convictions that resulted from errors in the Horizon system. The legislation applies to &quot;certain offences alleged to have been committed while the Horizon system was in use by the Post Office.&quot;

Pearce said that, due to the age of the cases, there was a significant lack of reliable information from the Post Office. The Department for Business and Trade had provided a list of 480 convictions in the 1990s. There is a separate scheme for redress for the pre-Horizon Capture computer system, designed to provide fair compensation for those who suffered financial shortfalls as a result of the faulty system.

The CCRC was reviewing a number of prosecutions, while a case had also been referred to the Court of Appeal.

A 2019 judgment in a case brought by subpostmasters found Horizon was introduced in late 1999 and 2000. The court ruled the Post Office&#39;s insistence that the system could not cause discrepancies was inconsistent with evidence of bugs in both the original and later versions.

At the same hearing, Fujitsu boss Patterson was forced to defend accusations that the company continued to profit from the UK public sector despite its role in the miscarriage of justice.

Chairing the committee, Labour MP Liam Byrne questioned Fujitsu&#39;s decision not to put aside money or contribute to the compensation scheme until the public inquiry had reported.

&quot;You&#39;re trying to present Fujitsu as a changed and ethical company. There doesn&#39;t appear to be a problem with cash flow, there doesn&#39;t appear to be a problem with profitability. There is definitely culpability. But your refusal to tell us how much Fujitsu will pay into a £1.8 billion bill for taxpayers leads people to the conclusion that, frankly, Fujitsu is behaving like a parasite on the British state without [stepping] up to its obligations,&quot; Byrne said.

&quot;We&#39;re not a parasite,&quot; Patterson responded. &quot;The government has got an option as to whether they wish to extend those contracts or not. If [it wishes us] to walk away from those contracts, we&#39;ll walk away from those contracts. I think that would be detrimental to society [and] the UK government.&quot;

He said Fujitsu had won around £500 million in re-procurement and contract extensions from the UK government since it promised not to bid for new government work in 2024. ®

            <h2>Ministry of Justice splurged £50M on security – still missed Legal Aid Agency cyberattack</h2>
            <p><strong>The Register | 2026-01-07</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2026/01/07/legal_aid_agency_attack/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The UK&#39;s Ministry of Justice spent £50 million ($67 million) on cybersecurity improvements at the Legal Aid Agency (LAA) before the high-profile cyberattack it disclosed last year.

The revelation was made in a report published by the Public Accounts Committee (PAC) today, which, alongside a thorough castigation of the MoJ&#39;s handling of the unsafe HMP Dartmoor prison, highlights a list of failures and issues regarding the handling of the LAA cyberattack.

Government officials told the PAC that the LAA&#39;s security shortcomings had been on its risk register since 2021. The agency&#39;s risk rating for a cyberattack was &quot;extremely high,&quot; prompting a huge cash injection to address the various issues, split into £8.5 million, £10.5 million, and £32 million rounds.

Both the MoJ and LAA acknowledged that the cyberattack, considered one of the most sensitive in British history, began in December 2024, but was not detected until April 2025.

The Register asked the MoJ for answers regarding the four-month delay. The PAC&#39;s report notes that some of the £50 million earmarked for security improvements (part of the £10.5 million funding round) was spent on a new threat detection system that ultimately spotted the intrusion in April. However, the point at which it became operational is not clear.

Speaking to the committee in October, LAA CEO Jane Harbottle said the agency secured funds for the system in 2024, but suggested that it was launched after December 2024. There is no explicit mention of when the system went live, but we await the MoJ&#39;s response on that front.

There was also a delay between detecting the attack in April and taking servers offline nearly a month later in May.

According to the PAC, the LAA did not initially understand that legal aid applicant data was compromised. In April, it thought only the details belonging to legal aid providers were involved, at which point it informed them that some financial data such as account and transaction data may have been accessed.

Harbottle told the committee: &quot;On Friday, May 16, we discovered that the attack was a lot more extensive than we had originally understood, and that the group behind it had accessed a large amount of information, potentially relating to legal aid applicants.

&quot;Further investigation at that stage identified that the attacker&#39;s first known entry into the system was back on December 31, 2024. At that stage, we immediately took our systems down. We obtained an injunction to stop the onward publication of any details that may appear on the web or on the dark web, and then we instigated contingency measures… across the provider base.&quot;

Between April 23 and May 16, senior-level discussions took place daily between the LAA and MoJ about the need to balance access to justice and the risks associated with keeping servers online following the attack.

Contingency plans were ultimately enacted following the server shutdown and while the LAA reported that no providers left the market, the impact on those across the legal sector was &quot;brutal.&quot;

Harbottle said that legal eagles&#39; main priority was to keep access to legal aid up and running, which the LAA did, but the more manual processes involved in managing caseloads in the digital era had a profound impact on workers&#39; wellbeing.

The LAA kept funds flowing to legal aid providers during the contingency period by issuing them an average payment, calculated by the average monthly payment for the three months before the attack. From the agency&#39;s perspective, it was overpaying providers during this time, but it will be recovering those funds over time.

It is recouping that money at 25 percent of the speed at which the LAA issued it, however, likely taking years to clear the backlog.

Harbottle said: &quot;For every week of contingency, we will recover that week&#39;s money over a month. If we have made 20 payments, it will take us 20 months to recoup that money.&quot;

MoJ permanent secretary Dr Jo Farrar said the LAA would likely need more money to ensure its entire IT estate is fully transformed.

Asked if that transformation will be accelerated in light of the attack on the LAA, home to the MoJ&#39;s highest-risk system, Farrar said it would depend on budget allocations, as an acceleration of the existing plan would require funding.

&quot;At the moment, that is subject to allocation decisions, and obviously, there are lots of funding decisions to balance,&quot; she said.

Of the money already allocated to securing LAA systems, some of it was spent on mitigating measures instead of outright system replacements. Farrar said the top priority is to protect the LAA from a cyberattack, and applying mitigations is sometimes the most efficient way of balancing priorities with available funds.

The PAC also asked whether the public can have confidence in the MoJ&#39;s systems that they can store personal data securely.

Farrar said the MoJ &quot;comprehensively reviewed&quot; all of its systems, and claimed the department has a clear understanding of where its weaknesses lie.

&quot;As with many other systems, in both the public and private sectors, we are seeing increasingly sophisticated actors who are determined to try and disrupt and access data for criminal purposes,&quot; she said.

&quot;We are doing all we can to understand where the risks are and update our systems accordingly. Obviously, as I said earlier, there is a huge cost to that.

&quot;We have dedicated money to the legal aid system, which was identified as our highest-risk system. Other decisions on improvements will now be taken through our allocation process. But, to reassure you, we have the assessment of all our systems, and we know where our risks are.&quot; ®

            <h2>Jaguar Land Rover wholesale volumes plummet 43% in cyberattack aftermath</h2>
            <p><strong>The Register | 2026-01-07</strong></p>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Brit luxury automaker Jaguar Land Rover has reported devastating preliminary Q3 results that lay bare the cascading consequences of a crippling cyberattack, revealing wholesale volumes collapsed more than two-fifths year-on-year.

Wholesale units tumbled to just 59,200 in the three months ended December 31, the third quarter of JLR&#39;s fiscal 2026, a whopping 43.3 percent decline. Retail sales shrank 25.1 percent to 79,600 units.

At the heart of JLR&#39;s troubles lies a September cyber break-in that halted production for weeks, creating ripples through the company&#39;s global supply chain and costing the Tata Motors-owned biz and the UK economy a big chunk of change.

&quot;Volumes in [the] quarter [were] initially impacted by production stoppages following [the] cyber incident and time required to distribute vehicles globally after production restart,&quot; the automaker said in a statement.

Manufacturing didn&#39;t return to normal levels until mid-November, leaving JLR scrambling to distribute vehicles to dealers worldwide even as the quarter drew to a close.

The company&#39;s deliberate wind-down of legacy Jaguar models ahead of new lines also served to drain volumes throughout the quarter, and recently imposed US tariffs on JLR exports dealt another blow, it said.

The carnage was global: North America saw wholesale volumes crater by an eye-watering 64.4 percent; Europe fared little better with a 47.6 percent decline; China, the world&#39;s largest automotive market, contracted 46 percent. Even the relatively stable UK market couldn&#39;t escape unscathed, albeit posting the smallest decline at just 0.9 percent. Retail sales told a similar tale.

Caught in the grip of the digital burglary, which Scattered Lapsus$ Hunters claimed responsibility for, JLR got £1.5 billion in financial support from the UK government to aid its recovery and help companies in the supply chain as JLR struggled to bring its invoicing system online.

The Bank of England estimated that the event contributed to a slowing UK economy, with gross domestic product growing 0.2 percent in calendar Q3 versus an expected 0.3 percent.

Tata Motors confirmed in November that the shutdown of production in the UK cost JLR around £1.8 billion ($2.35 billion) in its Q2 ended September 30, including exceptional costs of £196 million ($258 million) as a direct consequence of the cyberattack.

The Cyber Monitoring Centre (CMC), said the raid was the most serious type of event that it classifies, and warned it could cost the UK economy £2.1 billion ($2.75 billion).

JLR is to release full financial results for its Q3 in February. ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Bork!Bork!Bork! The baddest of AI bad guys, the Terminator, has confirmed what the vast majority of IT professionals already know. The machines are not about to rise, not until they can deal with that pesky battery voltage.

Spotted by The Register&#39;s very own US editor in a New York arcade, an elderly Terminator Salvation arcade game is struggling to boot and reporting what is likely to be a borked motherboard battery.

In days of yore, arcade hardware relied on exotic custom silicon – this writer has a particular fondness for the Sega System 16 and OutRun chippery, for example – but the borked screen here indicates that Skynet runs on some decidedly prosaic PC hardware. The Phoenix BIOS message on boot will be familiar to many, and the battery error suggests that whatever is keeping the BIOS settings alive is not long for this world.

While the game itself uses light guns as its primary mode of user interaction (so hitting F1 or F2 to deal with the Terminator&#39;s problems is not really an option), the &quot;Raw Thrills&quot; on offer will likely come from attempting to change a CR2032 battery on the motherboard without attracting the ire of the arcade manager.

Then again, perhaps this is indeed a sign of an impending takeover by the machines, with the battery alert there to lull the foolhardy into a false sense of security. &quot;Oho,&quot; a would-be player might say, &quot;if the Terminator can&#39;t even get past the BIOS boot screen, humanity is likely safe from the perils of artificial intelligence.&quot;

If the majority of the world&#39;s tech bros are to be believed, such confidence is misplaced. Terminator Salvation debuted in 2009, and things have moved on apace in the intervening years. OpenAI had yet to become a thing, and Nvidia&#39;s chips were boosting game frame rates rather than market performance. 2025 was a different story.

As such, a bit of wobbly voltage from the battery of a Terminator arcade game is a reminder of days past, when a leaky battery or aging hardware could bring down the machines. Popping a quarter or two into the slot was enough to bring the hardware to life temporarily.

Today&#39;s artificial intelligences have their own power problems, which are unlikely to be solved by a fresh button battery.

Considerably more than a pocketful of quarters will be needed to sustain the current AI revolution. ®

The smart version of the Varmblixt donut lamp comes with a wireless remote for changing the color of its soft glow.

After debuting 21 new Matter-compatible smart home devices last November, Ikea is expanding Matter support to some of its existing home furnishings starting with two upgraded lamps at CES 2026. The Varmblixt donut lamp is getting a small redesign to complement its new color-changing smart home capabilities, while the new Varmblixt pendant lamp will let you fine-tune the warmth of its white LED lighting.

The original version of the Varmblixt donut lamp featured a glossy finish designed to reflect the lighting in a room, but the new smart version has a soft, matte white finish to accentuate the appearance of its own internal lighting. Using an included Bilresa remote, the lamp will smoothly transition between 12 curated preset colors selected by Sabine Marcelis, an artist who helped design the original version of the lamp.

With the Varmblixt smart donut lamp connected to the Ikea Home Smart app through its Dirigera hub, you’ll have access to an expanded palette of 40 different colors, plus the ability to brighten or dim the intensity of the lighting. Ikea’s previously announced Matter-compatible smart bulbs have already become available in some European countries, but the $99.99 smart donut lamp won’t be released until April 2026.

The $149.99 smart version of the Varmblixt pendant lamp also won’t launch until April 2026. Like the inedible glowing donut, it can be controlled using an included Bilresa remote, but instead of changing colors, the hanging lamp transitions from cool white lighting mimicking daylight to a warm yellow glow reminiscent of a candle. It can also be connected to Ikea’s mobile app and Matter-compatible hub to be integrated into smart home routines and automations.

With Stranger Things over, the streamer is counting on the likes of One Piece and Bridgerton to carry the torch.

If you buy something from a Verge link, Vox Media may earn a commission. See our ethics statement.

Last year was a pivotal one for Netflix, as it saw arguably the streamer’s two most prominent series — Stranger Things and Squid Game — come to an end. And while Netflix has a number of competing priorities now, its lineup for 2026 also shows it’s not quite done with blockbuster franchises just yet.

The company just released its planned lineup for the year and it features plenty of major names. In terms of series, that includes the return of 3 Body Problem (season 2), the live-action Avatar: the Last Airbender (season 2), and The Witcher (a fifth and final season), none of which currently have a premiere date beyond a vague 2026. Other heavy hitters include season 4 of Bridgerton, which will be released in two parts on January 29th and February 26th, the second season of live-action One Piece on March 10th, and season 2 of Beef on April 16th. (I’m personally most excited for a new season of the excellent animated series Long Story Short.)

Also of note: Stranger Things isn’t quite done yet. A behind-the-scenes documentary on the fifth and final season will stream on January 12th, and the animated spinoff Tales From ‘85 is also due out in 2026.

Things are a little quieter when it comes to the film slate, which is highlighted by Peaky Blinders: The Immortal Man (March 6th in theaters, March 20th on Netflix), Enola Holmes 3 (summer), and Greta Gerwig’s take on Narnia (theaters in November, streaming in December). The gaming lineup is particularly sparse, with the only currently unreleased game being an untitled FIFA title, which joins Netflix’s relatively new TV game initiative.

But aside from the more traditional stuff, a big focus this year is Netflix’s ongoing push into live programming. And things start early: the Star Search revival premieres on January 20th, a live skyscraper climb will stream on January 23rd, and SAG-AFTRA’s Actor Awards will air on March 1st. This is on top of events from the WWE, NFL, and a new deal with MLB.

Of course, it’s worth noting that it’s only January, so Netflix will likely announce plenty of more series, movies, and events throughout the year (or possibly delay some of these).

The new Bluetooth speakers can pair with up to 100 units at once, turning a budget gadget into a fun party trick.

Ikea’s new cute, colorful Kallsup Bluetooth speakers cost just $10 (€5 in Europe) each and feature instant Bluetooth pairing. Pair one to your phone, then, with a two-button sequence, another Kallsup can join the party.

You can theoretically pair up to 100. The team I chatted with at CES — where Ikea is making its debut this year — says they’ve only paired 40 so far in their office. Challenge accepted!

Designed by Swedish designer and Ikea collaborator Ola Wihlborg, the portable square speaker measures just 2.75 x 2.75 x 3 inches. It has small legs on the bottom, a speaker grill on the side, and two pairing and play/pause buttons on top.

Available in white, dark pink, and lime green, Kallsup charges via USB-C, and Ikea says the battery is replaceable.

I played with nine Kallsup’s in Ikea’s suite yesterday and was impressed by the powerful sound from the pint-sized product.

To add additional speakers, I pressed the Bluetooth button on each new device to turn it on, waited for the start-up sound, and held the play button down for a few seconds until the music started playing.

It took only a couple of seconds per speaker, and once all nine were connected, the hotel suite got impressively loud.

It would be fun to scatter a bunch of these around a room — or even a garden, though they’re not waterproof — for a pop of color and plenty of sound. The Kallsup uses Bluetooth 5.3 and will be available in stores in April 2026.

The CES show floor officially opened its doors yesterday and along with it came a deluge of more announcements and reveals. If you’re struggling to stay on top of all the new tech, gadgets, concepts, and AI-powered devices as day two gets underway, we’ve rounded up some of the best hardware and upgrades that have debuted so far so you can quickly get up to speed.

There’s still lots more to come, so you can check back here every day, or catch up on all of The Verge’s CES 2026 coverage here.

How does Lenovo plan to top the ThinkBook Plus Gen 6 laptop it debuted at CES 2025 with a rollable screen that expands vertically from 14- to 16.7-inches? By turning the feature on its side. Lenovo’s new Pro Rollable gaming laptop’s screen expands horizontally from 16 inches with a 16:10 aspect ratio to an ultrawide 24 inches. It’s based on the Legion Pro 7i and will potentially feature an Intel Core Ultra processor paired with Nvidia’s flagship RTX 5090 laptop GPU, but the Pro Rollable is strictly a concept at this time.

A year ago Roborock debuted its Saros Z70 robot vacuum at CES 2025 with an articulated robotic arm that could reach in front of the robovac to pick up items like socks instead of running them over. The company’s new Saros Rover vacuum also features appendages, but in the form of two extending legs with wheels the robot can use to climb and clean stairs. A robovac that can clean multiple floors of a home by navigating stairs isn’t a new idea, but the Saros Rover can also clean each step as it climbs — albeit very slowly based on demos at CES 2026. There’s no timeline for a release yet as Roborock says it’s still in development, but the Saros Rover isn’t just a concept.

For the first time since Corsair acquired Elgato in 2018 the company is incorporating Stream Deck controls into a wired mechanical gaming keyboard. The keyboard side of the Corsair Galleon 100 SD has features like an 8,000Hz polling rate and a hot-swappable PCB that uses MLX Pulse switches, while on the other side you’ll find an integrated Stream Deck Plus with 12 customizable buttons, a pair of rotary dials, and a 5-inch multipurpose 720 x 1280 IPS display. It will be available starting on January 29th but is now available for preorder for $349.99.

Originally announced as a concept design at IFA 2024, Lenovo is turning the Auto Twist AI PC into a real laptop, now called the ThinkBook Plus Gen 7 Auto Twist laptop. Like the original, it features a 14-inch screen mounted to a motorized pivoting hinge that can automatically open the laptop for you with a knock on the lid or track your head and adjust its orientation to match your posture or position. You’ll be able to buy one in June with prices starting at $1,649.

Razer thinks headphones, not glasses, are the future of AI wearables, as demonstrated by its Project Motoko concept headphones that The Verge’s Victoria Song tried at CES 2026. Project Motoko looks similar to Razer’s wireless gaming headphones but adds a pair of 4K cameras positioned at eye level, near and far field microphones, and AI. The headphones are powered by an unnamed Qualcomm Snapdragon chip and compatible with major AI models that are used to identify images and sounds, or respond to your requests. Battery life has been tested to up to 36 hours, which eclipses all the AI smart glasses on the market.

Anker’s solution to open-ear wireless headphones that can quiet the world around you is a transforming design that positions the AeroFit 2 Pro’s drivers closer to the ear canal. The new $249.95 Shokz OpenFit Pro take a different approach. Instead of true ANC that requires a sealed ear canal, the open-ear buds offer noise reduction using a triple microphone array, a new speaker design, and an adaptive algorithm that generates audio to dampen unwanted sounds. The Verge’s Victoria Song found they worked surprisingly well and was also impressed with the OpenFit Pro’s improved bass performance, which is one place where open-ear headphones often disappoint.

In need of a lot of pixels and ports on your desk? Dell’s UltraSharp 52 Thunderbolt Hub Monitor is the world’s first 52-inch 6K display and features a 21:9 aspect ratio, a resolution of up to 6,144 x 2,560 at 120Hz, and a slight curve. It also doubles as a dock and includes two HDMI 2.1 ports, two DisplayPort 1.4 ports, and a bunch of upstream and downstream USB-C and USB-A ports, including a Thunderbolt 4 port that can deliver up to 140W of power. It’s available now for $2,899 with a stand, or $2,799 if you want to provide your own.

Does your butt deserve more than just a comfy place to sit? Razer thinks so, and has incorporated several of its existing gaming chair accessories into a proof of concept called Project Madison. It’s like the Frankenstein’s monster of gaming chairs incorporating THX-certified speakers with spatial audio, dual RGB light strips, and six haptic motors in the cushions pulsing force feedback effects into your back and below. There’s no pricing estimates, as Razer hasn’t announced if Project Madison will ever go into production.

Our biggest complaint with the original version of OhSnap’s MCON sliding gamepad is that it makes your phone too thick to slip into a pocket or comfortably carry while it’s attached. That problem is potentially being solved with two new versions that debuted at CES 2026. The $100 MCON Slim uses touchpads instead of thumbsticks, while the $60 MCON Lite uses joysticks similar to what’s found on the Nintendo 3Ds. But neither of the thinner versions features the original’s spring-loaded sliding mechanism, so there’s a definite tradeoff.

The Wolverine V3 BT isn’t just another wireless controller featuring drift-resistant tunneling magnetoresistance (TMR) joysticks. It’s also the world’s first gamepad to use ultra-low latency Bluetooth with a a sub-3ms response time. But there’s a catch. As the first accessory to launch under LG’s “Designed for LG Gaming Portal” program, the Wolverine V3 BT only uses ultra-low latency Bluetooth when connected to an LG TV running webOS 25. All other devices will connect to it using standard Bluetooth. Pricing and availability haven’t been finalized.

New OLED gaming monitors making their debut in 2026 should have clearer and sharper text thanks to panel makers Samsung Display and LG Display now lining up the colors of their subpixels in vertical RGB stripes. The improved OLED panels are already being supplied to companies like MSI, and Gigabyte, and at CES 2026 Asus announced three gaming monitors featuring the new “RGB stripe” screen tech. Pricing and availability aren’t known, but the 27-inch ROG Swift OLED PG27UCWM will also use Tandem OLED tech for increased brightness and longevity, while the 34-inch ROG Swift OLED PG34WCDN and the ROG Strix OLED XG34WCDMS will feature quantum dot OLED panels.

Smart door locks that conveniently automatically unlock as you approach aren’t a new idea, but they typically rely on a mix of Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, geofencing, and apps that are frequently unreliable. Aqara’s new $269.99 U400 smart deadbolt lock is the first to work with Apple’s Home Key’s hands-free unlocking using the U1 ultra-wideband (UWB) chip found in many iPhones and Apple Watches, without the need for a special app. The Verge’s Jennifer Pattison Tuohy had the chance to test the new smart lock for a week and found it “worked every time without any waiting,” making it a “significant upgrade” for their front door.

Although it’s currently just an R&D concept, Samsung Display showcased a new folding OLED panel that doesn’t have the visible crease that every foldable phone on the market exhibits when they’re opened. Samsung Display has been a longtime panel provider for Apple, so could this be the OLED screen that will be used in the rumored foldable iPhone?

Acer announced several new laptops at CES 2026 but the standout is its Swift 16 AI featuring what the company claims is the world’s largest haptic trackpad. It will give your fingers a good workout as they slide back and forth across its wide expanse, but the laptop includes a stylus turning the trackpad into a tablet for sketching or annotating documents. The Swift 16 AI will be available with Intel Panther Lake chips (up to the Core Ultra X9 388H), plenty of ports, and an optional OLED display when it launches in Q1 2026.

Want the portability of a laptop without the cramped keyboard? HP crammed an entire mini desktop computer into its new Eliteboard G1a keyboard, including an AMD Ryzen AI 300-series chip, stereo speakers, RAM, storage, a cooling fan, and ports. It can be connected to up to two 4K displays using a daisy-chain connection, and paired to a Bluetooth mouse. Pricing hasn’t been announced, but the G1a is expected to launch in March.

Samsung debuted one of the more impressive TVs at CES this year with a monstrous 130-inch Micro RGB TV featuring a frame designed to “appear less like a television and more like a vast, immersive window that visually expands the room,” according to a release from the company. Pricing and availability haven’t been announced, but the TV will mostly like be one of those upgrades that if you have to ask how much it costs, it’s probably not in your budget.

Lego doesn’t regularly exhibit at CES, but at this year’s show it announced its new Smart Play platform that’s debuting in three new Star Wars building sets in March. The platform relies on a new 2x4 Lego Smart Brick featuring interactive LED lighting, wireless connectivity, a speaker, microphone, and various sensors that can detect light, movements, tilting, and gestures. The Smart Brick works alongside NFC-equipped smart tags (Lego tile pieces) and minifigures to enable new interactive play opportunities. You can use the Smart Brick to trigger crash sounds when a Lego race car flips over, for example, or start playing The Imperial March when the new Emperor Palpatine figure is placed on his throne.

Using an adjustable ear hook design that repositions the drivers at the entrance of your ear canal, the Soundcore AeroFit 2 Pro are one of the first wireless open ear headphones that can be converted to an earbuds mode with active noise cancellation. You have the option of naturally hearing the world around you along with your music or podcasts, or blocking out your environment entirely. They’re available now through Anker’s online store for $179.99, but battery life maxes out at just 7 hours with the headphones alone, or up to 34 when paired with their charging case.

Amazon is jumping on the art TV bandwagon with its new 4K edge-lit LED Ember Artline TV. Available this spring in 55 to 65-inch sizes starting at $899, the TV has a matte finish to make photos and artwork look less like a screen and more like artwork hanging on your wall. Amazon is giving customers their choice of ten different frame styles to help match their room, while the TV can provide personalized recommendations for artwork that will best match the decor based on photos of the room where it’s installed.

Anker’s latest floor-mopping robovac will make your home smell better one way or another. Launching later this month for $1,599, the Eufy S2 is rated at up to 30,000Pa of suction, uses AI-powered obstacle detection and real-time 3D mapping to navigate your home and avoid obstacles, and has a retractable mop head that cleans itself with electrolyzed water. If that doesn’t alleviate bad smells, the Eufy S2 can instead mask them using a built-in aromatherapy dispenser with scents that include citrus, bamboo, basil, or sage.

Samsung hasn’t changed much with the design of its third-generation Freestyle projector. The new Freestyle Plus still looks like an oversized soda can and features an integrated stand, speakers, and Wi-Fi. But it’s nearly twice as bright as its predecessor at 430 ISO lumens, and it’s getting a host of new AI-powered automatic adjustment features. We got to try them out at CES 2026 and were impressed with the Freestyle Plus’ ability to automatically correct its alignment when projected on challenging surfaces like the corner of a room or even a wavy curtain.

8BitDo originally made a name for itself with budget-friendly but well-featured alternatives to Nintendo, Sony, and Microsoft’s controllers. It’s still very good at that, but 8BitDo’s new Ultimate 3E Controller for Xbox will be its most expensive gamepad when it launches in Q2 of 2026 for $149.99, and one of its most customizable. If tunneling magnetoresistance (TMR) joysticks, Hall effect triggers with adjustable stops, and official Xbox support (using a USB dongle) aren’t enough to sell you on the 3E, it also comes with interchangeable button modules letting you choose between membrane buttons and clicky micro switches.

First announced last month, The Verge’s Allison Johnson finally got some hands-on time with the Galaxy Z TriFold that uses a pair of inward-folding hinges to expand from a chunky phone to a large tablet. For now it’s only available in Korea, but the Z TriFold is expected to be available in the US sometime in Q1 2026 for what will most likely be a hefty chunk of change. Its biggest selling point, according to Johnson, is the potential to carry around a laptop replacement in your pocket. “The thing that makes the TriFold feel like it could finally be The One — the one device you can carry around, leaving all others behind — is none other than DeX. On the TriFold, DeX isn’t just a desktop environment when you pair it with an external display. It’s a whole standalone mode with windowing to your heart’s content.”

If you always seem to remember what groceries you need after you get home from the store, GE Appliances’ new package-scanning fridge can help you create a comprehensive shopping list. Launching in April 2026 for $4,899, the GE Profile Smart 4-Door French-Door Refrigerator with Kitchen Assistant has a scanner on the front you can use to scan empty packages, and you can manually add items to a shopping list using an 8-inch tablet on the door. There’s even a camera inside the fridge you can remotely access through an app to check if you’ve run out of something while you’re shopping.

Clicks is best known for its smartphone cases that add a physical BlackBerry-style compact keyboard. Its latest creation has that same keyboard, but also a 4.03-inch OLED screen, front and rear cameras, a headphone jack, and a 5G data connection, and it runs Android 16. The Clicks Communicator is designed to be an alternative to your daily driver smartphone that you can limit to essential apps to minimize distractions. At $499 it’s priced similarly to the Pixel 9A, but you can reserve one now for a limited time to get a discount.

As TCL and Hisense have done, LG is looking to usurp the dominance of Samsung’s The Frame in the art TV category. Its new LG Gallery TV leverages the company’s Gallery+ service that launched earlier this year to display everything from art to gaming scenes. The Gallery TV is a mini-LED TV with what is likely a matte coating, but LG describes it as having a “specialized screen that reduces glare and minimizes reflections for an art-like viewing experience.” It comes with a white frame, and while you can purchase additional wood-colored frames, pricing for the LG Gallery TV hasn’t been announced.

LG’s CLOiD is a home robot that can potentially do more than just clean your floors. The robot features a pair of articulated arms with seven degrees of motion mounted to a mobile base with a torso that can tilt and bend. LG says CLOiD can perform household tasks like folding and stacking laundry, putting food in the oven, or fetching something from your fridge. Can it do that faster or more reliably than you can? That remains to be seen, but CLOiD could be even more useful as a mobile smart home hub you can converse with as it follows you around the house.

Samsung’s Family Hub smart fridges aren’t new, but the company will soon be introducing a new feature for added convenience: voice-activated door opening and closing. When your hands are full of groceries, or are dirty while you’re whipping up a meal, you’ll be able to ask Bixby to “Shut the fridge door,” or “Open the door,” and it will open over 90 degrees giving you full access. If your mouth is full of food and you can’t properly articulate what you want, the door can also be opened or closed using a tap of your palm or the back of your hand.

If you pulled a Honey, I Shrunk the Kids on the Las Vegas Sphere, you’d end up with something like SwitchBot’s new dome-shaped Obboto RGB desk lamp. It’s wrapped in over 2,900 color-changing LEDs and can display preset animations, animated GIFs, AI-powered “mood animations,” music visualizers, or just the local weather and time if you want to be practical. Pricing and availability haven’t been announced yet.

Petkit’s new automatic pet feeder that can dole out up to seven days of wet food isn’t just about alleviating guilt about leaving your furry friend behind while you travel. The Yumshare Daily Feast uses an NFC tracking system to remove meals that haven’t been eaten in 48 hours and UVC lighting to sanitize the system for delivering fresh ones. What’s potentially even more useful is an AI-powered 1080p night vision camera that tracks when and how much your pet eats to provide insights on their diet and possible health issues. It’s expected to launch in April 2026 and will be sold through pet food companies.

Six years after its first Wallpaper TV debuted in 2017, LG has revived the line with its new LG OLED evo W6. The TV is 9mm thick thanks to its redesigned internal architecture and features a new mount so it can sit completely flush against a wall. Further improving installation is the W6’s use of LG’s Zero Connect Box which wireless sends a video signal from up to 33 feet away. The only physical cable you need to route to the W6 is for power. It will be available in 77 and 83-inch sizes.

GameSir may have already clinched the title for weirdest controller at CES 2026. The company shared more details about its upcoming Swift Drive gamepad that features a small steering wheel in the middle of the controller. The wheel’s connected to a high-precision Hall effect encoder and an equally small direct drive motor that provides force feedback effects while playing racing games and sims. There are additional haptic motors located in the gamepad’s Hall effect triggers to simulate effects like ABS braking, and it’s got RGB lighting effects that can be synced to your game. Pricing and availability haven’t been revealed yet.

It’s not quite as adorable as the furry Mirumi robot that debuted at last year’s CES, but Yukai Engineering’s new Baby FuFu is potentially more practical. It looks like a cuddly cat that’s huffing and puffing and features an internal fan that will keep young kids cool while preventing tiny fingers from reaching any dangerous moving parts. It’s expected to arrive in mid-2026 for $50 to $60.

There’s never a shortage of exciting and innovative tech at CES. A superthin TV and tri-folding phone are cool and all, but sometimes the weirdest gadgets are the ones that make us go “huh.”

Luckily, there was plenty of wacky stuff on the show floor this year, and we’ve rounded up some of the most bizarre (in no particular order).

Instead of stepping out of the shower and having to wave your hair dryer around your head for 15 minutes, imagine just sitting on your couch while a crescent-shaped device hangs over your head, drying your hair as you watch TV or play a video game. Well, that’s exactly what a company called Dreame has developed, and I think it’s kind of a good idea — but maybe not for $700.

The device is also a lamp, so at least you won’t have to explain to people why you have a giant, standing hair dryer in your living room.

Our very own Victoria Song braved the taint-zapping booth at CES 2026, which is exactly what it sounds like: a device that sends electrodes into a man’s perineum, with the goal of preventing premature ejaculation.

The device, called Mor, is attached to an adhesive patch containing electrodes that you, well, stick on your taint. And no, this isn’t vaporware — the starter pack is available for about $300.

I’m not sure what’s scarier: a friend armed with clippers and exactly one YouTube tutorial, or putting AI in charge of your haircut. Glyde claims its smart clippers allow for “mistake-proof” cuts by automatically adjusting their blades as you go.

But first, you have to strap on a “fade band” that the clippers use to detect their position on your head. Then, just turn them on and hope for the best.

Desktop anime girls made a comeback at CES 2026. This time around, Razer showed off its Project Ava pod, featuring a 5.5-inch hologram of the cat-ear-wearing anime waifu Kira, or the tattooed husbando, Zane. They’re supposed to look at you using a built-in camera (or your webcam) and can see what’s happening on your computer screen via the device’s USB-C connection to offer gaming tips. The avatars are powered by xAI’s Grok (ew), and you can chat with them using the pod’s dual-mic array.

No, this isn’t a prop from The Silence of the Lambs; this is L’Oréal’s LED Face Mask. The flexible, silicone mask looks like another layer of skin, complete with red lights that highlight a veinlike pattern. L’Oréal claims its face mask tightens and smooths skin using targeted red light and near-infrared light. The company expects to launch the LED Mask in 2027.

A company called Tomorrow Doesn’t Matter (TDM) is launching Neo over-ear headphones that you can transform into a speaker by folding in the flexible headband. Along with 40mm drivers on the inside of the Neo’s ear cups, the device offers a separate pair of 40mm drivers that activate when using speaker mode.

TDM’s Neo headphones are launching as part of a Kickstarter campaign and will cost $249.

The home battery company Jackery took the wraps off a solar-powered gazebo that looks more like an incomplete storage container than something that I’d want to put in my backyard. It comes equipped with 2,000W of solar panels, built-in lighting, a pull-down projector screen, and two AC outlets.

What’s perhaps even more outrageous than the design is its price tag: it’s expected to cost anywhere between $12,000 and $15,000, not including battery storage.

The Chinese phone maker Honor offered a closer look at a non-working Robot Phone prototype during CES 2026, which comes with a camera mounted on a tiny gimbal that folds out from the back of the device. Based on a promo shared by Honor, the camera appears to move on its own and track subjects, but what else it can do will remain a mystery — at least until the company launches it at MWC 2026.

This little bot may give you a better understanding of a day in the life of your pet while you’re not home. The bot is called Vex, and it’s built to follow your cat or dog around your house, capturing videos while it attempts to play with them. Vex will even edit the video itself by using AI to create “moving narratives and shareable stories.”

It’s an adorable concept — if it works. FrontierX, the bot’s manufacturer, hasn’t shared footage edited by Vex yet.

The health tech startup Vivoo has created a “smart” menstrual pad that’s designed to detect follicle-stimulating hormone, as high levels may suggest lower ovarian reserves, fertility issues, or conditions like polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). The pads are pricey at $4 to $5 apiece, but they display results on the back, which users can snap a picture of using the Vivoo app for more information.

A $399 chef’s knife from Seattle Ultrasonics promises to cut with 50 percent less effort, thanks to piezoelectric ceramic crystals that vibrate more than 30,000 times per second. The company claims you can’t see or even feel the vibration when activated.

You can charge the knife with a USB-C charger or a $149 mahogany wireless charging tile that you can stick on your wall or place on your counter (and yes, you need to charge this device, too).

            <div id="article-text">The issue only affects macOS users, and a manual fix is now available.

The issue only affects macOS users, and a manual fix is now available.

If you’re among the macOS users experiencing some weird issues with your Logitech mouse, then good news: Logitech has now released a fix. This comes after multiple Reddit users reported yesterday that Logi Options Plus — the app required to manage and configure the controls on Logitech accessories — had stopped working, preventing them from using customized scrolling features, button actions, and gestures.

One Reddit user said that the scroll directions and extra buttons on their Logitech mouse “were not working as I intended” and that the Logi Options Plus app became stuck in a boot loop upon opening it to identify the cause. Logitech has since acknowledged the situation and said that its G Hub app — a similar management software for gaming devices under the Logitech G brand — was also affected.

According to Logitech’s support page, the problem was caused by “an expired certificate” required for the apps to run. Windows users were unaffected. The issues only impacted Mac users because macOS prevents certain applications from running if it doesn’t detect a valid Developer ID certificate, something that has affected other apps in the past.

A patch has now been released to fix the issue, which needs to be manually installed “because the certificate also affected the in‑app updater.” Logitech says that the device settings, customizations, and profiles for impacted users will remain intact after installing the patch. This fix is available for devices running on macOS 26 Tahoe, macOS 15 Sequoia, macOS 14 Sonoma, and macOS 13 Ventura, with a fix for older versions of macOS coming “at a later time.”

“We dropped the ball here. This is an inexcusable mistake,” Logitech spokesperson ATXsantucci said in response to user complaints on Reddit. “We’re extremely sorry for the inconvenience caused.”

Europe’s drone-filled vision for the future of war

Last spring, 3,000 British soldiers deployed an invisible automated intelligence network, known as a “digital targeting web,” as part of a NATO exercise called Hedgehog in the damp forests of Estonia’s eastern territories.The system had been cobbled together over the course of four months—an astonishing pace for weapons development, which is usually measured in years. Its purpose is to connect everything that looks for targets—“sensors,” in military lingo—and everything that fires on them (“shooters”) to a single, shared wireless electronic brain.Eighty years after total war last transformed the continent, the Hedgehog tests signal a brutal new calculus of European defense. But leaning too much on this new mathematics of warfare could be a risky bet. Read the full story.

MIT Technology Review Narrated: How one controversial startup hopes to cool the planet

Stardust Solutions believes that it can solve climate change—for a price.The Israel-based geoengineering startup has said it expects nations will soon pay it more than a billion dollars a year to launch specially equipped aircraft into the stratosphere. Once they’ve reached the necessary altitude, those planes will disperse particles engineered to reflect away enough sunlight to cool down the planet, purportedly without causing environmental side effects.

But numerous solar geoengineering researchers are skeptical that Stardust will line up the customers it needs to carry out a global deployment in the next decade. They’re also highly critical of the idea of a private company setting the global temperature for us.

Inside the decades-long fight over Yahoo’s misdeeds in ChinaWhen you think of Big Tech these days, Yahoo is probably not top of mind. But for Chinese dissident Xu Wanping, the company still looms large—and has for nearly two decades.In 2005, Xu was arrested for signing online petitions relating to anti-Japanese protests. He didn’t use his real name, but he did use his Yahoo email address. Yahoo China violated its users’ trust—providing information on certain email accounts to Chinese law enforcement, which in turn allowed the government to identify and arrest some users.Xu was one of them; he would serve nine years in prison. Now, he and five other Chinese former political prisoners are suing Yahoo and a slate of co-defendants—not because of the company’s information-sharing (which was the focus of an earlier lawsuit filed by other plaintiffs), but rather because of what came after.

            <div id="article-text">MIT Technology Review Explains: Let our writers untangle the complex, messy world of technology to help you understand what’s coming next. You can read more from the series here.

I am writing this because one of my editors woke up in the middle of the night and scribbled on a bedside notepad: “What is a parameter?” Unlike a lot of thoughts that hit at 4 a.m., it’s a really good question—one that goes right to the heart of how large language models work. And I’m not just saying that because he’s my boss. (Hi, Boss!)

A large language model’s parameters are often said to be the dials and levers that control how it behaves. Think of a planet-size pinball machine that sends its balls pinging from one end to the other via billions of paddles and bumpers set just so. Tweak those settings and the balls will behave in a different way.

OpenAI’s GPT-3, released in 2020, had 175 billion parameters. Google DeepMind’s latest LLM, Gemini 3, may have at least a trillion—some think it’s probably more like 7 trillion—but the company isn’t saying. (With competition now fierce, AI firms no longer share information about how their models are built.)

But the basics of what parameters are and how they make LLMs do the remarkable things that they do are the same across different models. Ever wondered what makes an LLM really tick—what’s behind the colorful pinball-machine metaphors? Let’s dive in.

Think back to middle school algebra, like 2a + b. Those letters are parameters: Assign them values and you get a result. In math or coding, parameters are used to set limits or determine output. The parameters inside LLMs work in a similar way, just on a mind-boggling scale.

Short answer: an algorithm. When a model is trained, each parameter is set to a random value. The training process then involves an iterative series of calculations (known as training steps) that update those values. In the early stages of training, a model will make errors. The training algorithm looks at each error and goes back through the model, tweaking the value of each of the model’s many parameters so that next time that error is smaller. This happens over and over again until the model behaves in the way its makers want it to. At that point, training stops and the values of the model’s parameters are fixed.

In theory! In practice, because LLMs are trained on so much data and contain so many parameters, training them requires a huge number of steps and an eye-watering amount of computation. During training, the 175 billion parameters inside a medium-size LLM like GPT-3 will each get updated tens of thousands of times. In total, that adds up to quadrillions (a number with 15 zeros) of individual calculations. That’s why training an LLM takes so much energy. We’re talking about thousands of specialized high-speed computers running nonstop for months.

There are three different types of parameters inside an LLM that get their values assigned through training: embeddings, weights, and biases. Let’s take each of those in turn.

An embedding is the mathematical representation of a word (or part of a word, known as a token) in an LLM’s vocabulary. An LLM’s vocabulary, which might contain up to a few hundred thousand unique tokens, is set by its designers before training starts. But there’s no meaning attached to those words. That comes during training.

When a model is trained, each word in its vocabulary is assigned a numerical value that captures the meaning of that word in relation to all the other words, based on how the word appears in countless examples across the model’s training data.

Yeah. But there’s a bit more to it. The numerical value—the embedding—that represents each word is in fact a list of numbers, with each number in the list representing a different facet of meaning that the model has extracted from its training data. The length of this list of numbers is another thing that LLM designers can specify before an LLM is trained. A common size is 4,096.

Yup, that’s an embedding. And each of those numbers is tweaked during training. An LLM with embeddings that are 4,096 numbers long is said to have 4,096 dimensions.

It might look like a strange number. But LLMs (like anything that runs on a computer chip) work best with powers of two—2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, and so on. LLM engineers have found that 4,096 is a power of two that hits a sweet spot between capability and efficiency. Models with fewer dimensions are less capable; models with more dimensions are too expensive or slow to train and run.

Using more numbers allows the LLM to capture very fine-grained information about how a word is used in many different contexts, what subtle connotations it might have, how it relates to other words, and so on.

Back in February, OpenAI released GPT-4.5, the firm’s largest LLM yet (some estimates have put its parameter count at more than 10 trillion). Nick Ryder, a research scientist at OpenAI who worked on the model, told me at the time that bigger models can work with extra information, like emotional cues, such as when a speaker’s words signal hostility: “All of these subtle patterns that come through a human conversation—those are the bits that these larger and larger models will pick up on.”

The upshot is that all the words inside an LLM get encoded into a high-dimensional space. Picture thousands of words floating in the air around you. Words that are closer together have similar meanings. For example, “table” and “chair” will be closer to each other than they are to “astronaut,” which is close to “moon” and “Musk.” Way off in the distance you can see “prestidigitation.” It’s a little like that, but instead of being related to each other across three dimensions, the words inside an LLM are related across 4,096 dimensions.

It’s dizzying stuff. In effect, an LLM compresses the entire internet into a single monumental mathematical structure that encodes an unfathomable amount of interconnected information. It’s both why LLMs can do astonishing things and why they’re impossible to fully understand.

A weight is a parameter that represents the strength of a connection between different parts of a model—and one of the most common types of dial for tuning a model’s behavior. Weights are used when an LLM processes text.

When an LLM reads a sentence (or a book chapter), it first looks up the embeddings for all the words and then passes those embeddings through a series of neural networks, known as transformers, that are designed to process sequences of data (like text) all at once. Every word in the sentence gets processed in relation to every other word.

This is where weights come in. An embedding represents the meaning of a word without context. When a word appears in a specific sentence, transformers use weights to process the meaning of that word in that new context. (In practice, this involves multiplying each embedding by the weights for all other words.)

Biases are another type of dial that complement the effects of the weights. Weights set the thresholds at which different parts of a model fire (and thus pass data on to the next part). Biases are used to adjust those thresholds so that an embedding can trigger activity even when its value is low. (Biases are values that are added to an embedding rather than multiplied with it.)

By shifting the thresholds at which parts of a model fire, biases allow the model to pick up information that might otherwise be missed. Imagine you’re trying to hear what somebody is saying in a noisy room. Weights would amplify the loudest voices the most; biases are like a knob on a listening device that pushes quieter voices up in the mix.

Here’s the TL;DR: Weights and biases are two different ways that an LLM extracts as much information as it can out of the text it is given. And both types of parameters are adjusted over and over again during training to make sure they do this.

No, neurons are more a way to organize all this math—containers for the weights and biases, strung together by a web of pathways between them. It’s all very loosely inspired by biological neurons inside animal brains, with signals from one neuron triggering new signals from the next and so on.

Each neuron in a model holds a single bias and weights for every one of the model’s dimensions. In other words, if a model has 4,096 dimensions—and therefore its embeddings are lists of 4,096 numbers—then each of the neurons in that model will hold one bias and 4,096 weights.

Neurons are arranged in layers. In most LLMs, each neuron in one layer is connected to every neuron in the layer above. A 175-billion-parameter model like GPT-3 might have around 100 layers with a few tens of thousands of neurons in each layer. And each neuron is running tens of thousands of computations at a time.

When an LLM processes a piece of text, the numerical representation of that text—the embedding—gets passed through multiple layers of the model. In each layer, the value of the embedding (that list of 4,096 numbers) gets updated many times by a series of computations involving the model’s weights and biases (attached to the neurons) until it gets to the final layer.

The idea is that all the meaning and nuance and context of that input text is captured by the final value of the embedding after it has gone through a mind-boggling series of computations. That value is then used to calculate the next word that the LLM should spit out.

It won’t be a surprise that this is more complicated than it sounds: The model in fact calculates, for every word in its vocabulary, how likely that word is to come next and ranks the results. It then picks the top word. (Kind of. See below …)

That word is appended to the previous block of text, and the whole process repeats until the LLM calculates that the most likely next word to spit out is one that signals the end of its output.

LLM designers can also specify a handful of other parameters, known as hyperparameters. The main ones are called temperature, top-p, and top-k.

Temperature is a parameter that acts as a kind of creativity dial. It influences the model’s choice of what word comes next. I just said that the model ranks the words in its vocabulary and picks the top one. But the temperature parameter can be used to push the model to choose the most probable next word, making its output more factual and relevant, or a less probable word, making the output more surprising and less robotic.

Top-p and top-k are two more dials that control the model’s choice of next words. They are settings that force the model to pick a word at random from a pool of most probable words instead of the top word. These parameters affect how the model comes across—quirky and creative versus trustworthy and dull.

That’s one of the hottest questions in AI right now. There are a lot of different ways it can happen. Researchers have found that the amount of training data makes a huge difference. First you need to make sure the model sees enough data: An LLM trained on too little text won’t make the most of all its parameters, and a smaller model trained on the same amount of data could outperform it.

Another trick researchers have hit on is overtraining. Showing models far more data than previously thought necessary seems to make them perform better. The result is that a small model trained on a lot of data can outperform a larger model trained on less data. Take Meta’s Llama LLMs. The 70-billion-parameter Llama 2 was trained on around 2 trillion words of text; the 8-billion-parameter Llama 3 was trained on around 15 trillion words of text. The far smaller Llama 3 is the better model.

A third technique, known as distillation, uses a larger model to train a smaller one. The smaller model is trained not only on the raw training data but also on the outputs of the larger model’s internal computations. The idea is that the hard-won lessons encoded in the parameters of the larger model trickle down into the parameters of the smaller model, giving it a boost.

In fact, the days of single monolithic models may be over. Even the largest models on the market, like OpenAI’s GPT-5 and Google DeepMind’s Gemini 3, can be thought of as several small models in a trench coat. Using a technique called “mixture of experts,” large models can turn on just the parts of themselves (the “experts”) that are required to process a specific piece of text. This combines the abilities of a large model with the speed and lower power consumption of a small one.

But that’s not the end of it. Researchers are still figuring out ways to get the most out of a model’s parameters. As the gains from straight-up scaling tail off, jacking up the number of parameters no longer seems to make the difference it once did. It’s not so much how many you have, but what you do with them.

You want to see a parameter? Knock yourself out: Here&#39;s an embedding.

The experimental model won&#39;t compete with the biggest and best, but it could tell us why they behave in weird ways—and how trustworthy they really are.

Four ways to think about this year&#39;s reckoning.

They managed to cut the size of the AI reasoning model by more than half—and claim it can now answer politically sensitive questions once off limits in Chinese AI systems.

A conversation with a chatbot can shift people&#39;s political views—but the most persuasive models also spread the most misinformation.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Nandan Nilekani can’t stop trying to push India into the future. He started nearly 30 years ago, masterminding an ongoing experiment in technological state capacity that started with Aadhaar—the world’s largest digital identity system. Aadhaar means “foundation” in Hindi, and on that bedrock Nilekani and people working with him went on to build a sprawling collection of free, interoperating online tools that add up to nothing less than a digital infrastructure for society. They cover government services, digital payments, banking, credit, and health care, offering convenience and access that would be eye-popping in wealthy countries a tenth of India’s size. In India those systems are called, collectively, “digital public infrastructure,” or DPI.

At 70 years old, Nilekani should be retired. But he has a few more ideas. India’s electrical grid is creaky and prone to failure; Nilekani wants to add a layer of digital communication to stabilize it. And then there’s his idea to expand the financial functions in DPI to the rest of the world, creating a global digital backbone for commerce that he calls the “finternet.”

“It sounds like some crazy stuff,” Nilekani says. “But I think these are all big ideas, which over the next five years will have demonstrable, material impact.” As a last act in public life, why not Aadhaarize the world?

Today, a farmer in a village in India, hours from the nearest bank, can collect welfare payments or transfer money by simply pressing a thumb to a fingerprint scanner at the local store. Digitally authenticated copies of driver’s licenses, birth certificates, and educational records can be accessed and shared via a digital wallet that sits on your smartphone.

In big cities, where cash is less and less common (just trying to break a bill can be a major headache), mobile payments are ubiquitous, whether you’re buying a TV from a high-street retailer or a coconut from a roadside cart. There are no fees, and any payment app or bank account can send money to any other. The country’s chaotic patchwork of public and private hospitals have begun digitizing all their medical records and uploading them to a nationwide platform. On the Open Network for Digital Commerce (ONDC), people can do online shopping searches on whatever app they want, and the results show sellers from an array of other platforms, too. The idea is to liberate small merchants and consumers from the walled gardens of online shopping giants like Amazon and the domestic giant Flipkart.

In the most populous nation on Earth—with 1.4 billion people—a large portion of the bureaucracy anyone encounters in daily life happens seamlessly and in the cloud.

At the heart of all these tools is Aadhaar. The system gives every Indian a 12-digit number that, in combination with either a fingerprint scan or an SMS code, allows access to government services, SIM cards, basic bank accounts, digital signature services, and social welfare payments. The Indian government says that since its inception in 2009, Aadhaar has saved 3.48 trillion rupees ($39.2 billion) by boosting efficiency, bypassing corrupt officials, and cutting other types of fraud. The system is controversial and imperfect—a database with 1.4 billion people in it comes with inherent security and privacy concerns. Still, in the most populous nation on Earth, a big portion of the bureaucracy anyone might encounter in daily life just happens in the cloud.

Nilekani was behind much of that innovation, marshaling an army of civil servants, tech companies, and volunteers. Now he sees it in action every day. “It reinforces that what you have done is not some abstract stuff, but real stuff for real people,” he says.

By his own admission, Nilekani is entering the twilight of his career. But it’s not over yet. He’s now “chief mentor” for the India Energy Stack (IES), a government initiative to connect the fragmented data held by companies responsible for generating, transmitting, and distributing power. India’s grids are unstable and disparate, but Nilekani hopes an Aadhaar-like move will help. IES aims to give unique digital identities not only to power plants and energy storage facilities but even to rooftop solar panels and electric vehicles. All the data attached to those things—device characteristics, energy rating certifications, usage information—will be in a common, machine-readable format and shared on the same open protocols.

Ideally, that’ll give grid operators a real-time view of energy supply and demand. And if it works, it might also make it simpler and cheaper for anyone to connect to the grid—even everyday folks selling excess power from their rooftop solar rigs, says RS Sharma, the chair of the project and Nilekani’s deputy while building Aadhaar.

Nilekani’s other side hustle is even more ambitious. His idea for a global “finternet” combines Aadhaarization with blockchains—creating digital representations called tokens for not only financial instruments like stocks or bonds but also real-world assets like houses or jewelry. Anyone from a bank to an asset manager or even a company could create and manage these tokens, but Nilekani’s team especially hopes the idea will help poor people trade their assets, or use them as loan collateral—expanding financial services to those who otherwise couldn’t access them.

It sounds almost wild-eyed. Yet the finternet project has 30 partners across four continents. Nilekani says it’ll launch next year.

Nilekani was born in Bengaluru, in 1955. His family was middle class and, Nilekani says, “seized with societal issues and challenges.” His upbringing was also steeped in the kind of socialism espoused by the newish nation’s first prime minister, Jawaharlal Nehru.

After studying electrical engineering at the Indian Institute of Technology, in 1981 Nilekani helped found Infosys, an information technology company that pioneered outsourcing and helped turned India into the world’s IT back office. In 1999, he was part of a government-appointed task force trying to upgrade the infrastructure and services in Bengaluru, then emerging as India’s tech capital. But Nilekani was at the time leery of being viewed as just another techno-optimist. “I didn’t want to be seen as naive enough to believe that tech could solve everything,” he says.

Seeing the scope of the problem changed his mind—sclerotic bureaucracy, endemic corruption, and financial exclusion were intractable without technological solutions. In 2008 Nilekani published a book, Imagining India: The Idea of a Renewed Nation. It was a manifesto for an India that could leapfrog into a networked future.

And it got him a job. At the time more than half the births in the country were not recorded, and up to 400 million Indians had no official identity document. Manmohan Singh, the prime minister, asked Nilekani to put into action an ill-defined plan to create a national identity card.

Nilekani’s team made a still-controversial decision to rely on biometrics. A system based on people’s fingerprints and retina scans meant nobody could sign up twice, and nobody had to carry paperwork. In terms of execution, it was like trying to achieve industrialization but skip a steam era. Deployment required a monumental data collection effort, as well as new infrastructure that could compare each new enrollment against hundreds of millions of existing records in seconds. At its peak, the Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI), the agency responsible for administering Aadhaar, was registering more than a million new users a day. That happened with a technical team of just about 50 developers, and in the end cost slightly less than half a billion dollars.

Buoyed by their success, Nilekani and his allies started casting around for other problems they could solve using the same digitize-the-real-world playbook. “We built more and more layers of capability,” Nilekani says, “and then this became a wider-ranging idea. More grandiose.”

While other countries were building digital backbones with full state control (as in China) or in public-private partnerships that favored profit-seeking corporate approaches (as in the US), Nilekani thought India needed something else. He wanted critical technologies in areas like identity, payments, and data sharing to be open and interoperable, not monopolized by either the state or private industry. So the tools that make up DPI use open standards and open APIs, meaning that anyone can plug into the system. No single company or institution controls access—no walled gardens.

Of course, another way to look at putting financial and government services and records into giant databases is that it’s a massive risk to personal liberty. Aadhaar, in particular, has faced criticism from privacy advocates concerned about the potential for surveillance. Several high-profile data breaches of Aadhaar records held by government entities have shaken confidence in the system, most recently in 2023, when security researchers found hackers selling the records of more than 800 million Indians on the dark web.

Technically, this shouldn’t matter—an Aadhaar number ought to be useless without biometric or SMS-based authentication. It’s “a myth that this random number is a very powerful number,” says Sharma, the onetime co-lead of UIDAI. “I don’t have any example where somebody’s Aadhaar disclosure would have harmed somebody.”

One problem is that in everyday use, Aadhaar users often bypass the biometric authentication system. To ensure that people use a genuine address at registration, Aadhaar administrators give people their numbers on an official-looking document. Indians co-opted this paperwork as a proof of identity on its own. And since the document—Indians even call it an “Aadhaar card”—doesn’t have an expiration date, it’s possible for people to get multiple valid cards with different details by changing their address or date of birth. That’s quite a loophole. In 2018 an NGO report found that 67% of people using Aadhaar to open a bank account relied on this verification document rather than digital authentication. That report was the last time anyone published data on the problem, so nobody knows how bad it is today. “Everybody’s living on anecdotes,” says Kiran Jonnalagadda, an anti-Aadhaar activist.

In other cases, flaws in Aadhaar’s biometric technology have caused people to be denied essential government services. The government downplays these risks, but again, it’s impossible to tell how serious the problem is because the UIDAI won’t disclose numbers. “There needs to be a much more honest acknowledgment, documentation, and then an examination of how those exclusions can be mitigated,” says Apar Gupta, director of the Internet Freedom Foundation.

Beyond the potential for fraud, it’s also true that the free and interoperable tools haven’t reached all the people who might find them useful, especially among India’s rural and poorer populations. Nilekani’s hopes for openness haven’t fully come to pass. Big e-commerce companies still dominate, and retail sales on ONDC have been dropping steadily since 2024, when financial incentives to participate began to taper off. The digital payments and government documentation services have hundreds of millions of users, numbers most global technology companies would love to see—but in a country as large as India, that leaves a lot of people out.

The usually calm Nilekani bristles at that criticism; he has heard it before. Detractors overlook the dysfunction that preceded these efforts, he says, and he remains convinced that technology was the only way forward. “How do you move a country of 1.4 billion people?” he asks. “There’s no other way you can fix it.”

The proof is self-evident, he says. Indians have opened more than 500 million basic bank accounts using Aadhaar; before it came into use, millions of those people had been completely unbanked. Earlier this year, India’s Unified Payments Interface overtook Visa as the world’s largest real-time payments system. “There is no way Aadhaar could have worked but for the fact that people needed this thing,” Nilekani says. “There’s no way payments would have worked without people needing it. So the voice of the people—they’re voting with their feet.”

That need might be present in countries beyond India. “Many countries don’t have a proper birth registration system. Many countries don’t have a payment system. Many countries don’t have a way for data to be leveraged,” Nilekani says. “So this is a very powerful idea.” It seems to be spreading. Foreign governments regularly send delegations to Bengaluru to study India’s DPI tools. The World Bank and the United Nations have tried to introduce the concept to other developing countries equally eager to bring their economies into the digital age. The Gates Foundation has established projects to promote digital infrastructure, and Nilekani has set up and funded a network of think tanks, research institutes, and other NGOs aimed at, as he says, “propagating the gospel.”

Still, he admits he might not live to see DPI go global. “There are two races,” Nilekani says. “My personal race against time and India’s race against time.” He worries that the economic potential of its vast young population—the so-called demographic dividend—could turn into a demographic disaster. Despite rapid growth, gains have been uneven. Youth unemployment remains stubbornly high—a particularly volatile problem in a large and economically turbulent country.

“Maybe I’m a junkie,” he says. “Why the hell am I doing all this? I think I need it. I think I need to keep curious and alive and looking at the future.” But that’s the thing about building the future: It never quite arrives.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Water shortages in Southern California made an indelible impression on Evelyn Wang ’00 when she was growing up in Los Angeles. “I was quite young, perhaps in first grade,” she says. “But I remember we weren’t allowed to turn our sprinklers on. And everyone in the neighborhood was given disinfectant tablets for the toilet and encouraged to keep flushing to a minimum. I didn’t understand exactly what was happening. But I saw that everyone in the community was affected by the scarcity of this resource.”

Today, as extreme weather events increasingly affect communities around the world, Wang is leading MIT’s effort to tackle the interlinked challenges of a changing climate and a burgeoning global demand for energy. Last April, after wrapping up a two-year stint directing the US Department of Energy’s Advanced Research Projects Agency–Energy (ARPA-E), she returned to the campus where she’d been both an undergraduate and a faculty member to become the inaugural vice president for energy and climate.

“The accelerating problem of climate change and its countless impacts represent the greatest scientific, technical, and policy challenge of this or any age,” MIT President Sally Kornbluth wrote in a January 2025 letter to the MIT community announcing the appointment. “We are tremendously fortunate that Evelyn Wang has agreed to lead this crucial work.”

MIT has studied and worked on problems of climate and energy for decades. In recent years, with temperatures rising, storms strengthening, and energy demands surging, that work has expanded and intensified, spawning myriad research projects, policy proposals, papers, and startups. The challenges are so urgent that MIT launched several Institute-wide initiatives, including President Rafael Reif’s Climate Grand Challenges (2020) and President Kornbluth’s Climate Project (2024).

But Kornbluth has argued that MIT needs to do even more. Her creation of the new VP-level post that Wang now holds underscores that commitment.

Wang is well suited for the role. The Ford Professor of Engineering at MIT and former head of the Department of Mechanical Engineering, she joined the faculty in 2007, shortly after she completed her PhD at Stanford University. Her research centers on thermal management and energy conversion and storage, but she also works on nano-engineered surfaces and materials, as well as water harvesting and purification. Wang and her colleagues have produced a device based on nanophotonic crystals that could double the efficiency of solar cells—one of MIT Technology Review’s 10 breakthrough technologies of 2017. And the device she invented with Nobel laureate Omar Yaghi for extracting water from very dry air was named one of 2017’s top 10 emerging technologies by Scientific American and the World Economic Forum, and in 2018 earned her the Prince Sultan Bin Abdulaziz International Prize for Water. (See story on this water harvesting research in the January/February issue of MIT Technology Review.)

Wang has a deep knowledge of the Institute—and even deeper roots here. (See “Family Ties,” MIT Alumni News, March/April 2015.) Her parents met at MIT as PhD students from Taiwan in the 1960s; they were married in the MIT chapel. When Wang arrived at MIT in 1996 as a first-year student, her brother Alex ’96, MEng ’97, had just graduated and was working on a master’s degree in electrical engineering. Her other brother, Ben, would earn his PhD at MIT in 2007. She even met her husband, Russell Sammon ’98, at MIT. Apart from her time at ARPA-E, a very brief stint at Bell Labs, and sabbatical work at Google, she has spent her entire professional career at the Institute. So she has a rare perspective on the resources MIT can draw on to respond to the climate and energy challenge.

“The beating heart of MIT is innovation,” she says. “We are innovators. And innovation is something that will help us leapfrog some of the potential hurdles as we work toward climate and energy solutions. Our ability to innovate can enable us to move closer toward energy security, toward sustainable resource development and use.”

The prevailing innovative mindset at MIT is backed by a deep desire to tackle the problem.Many people on campus are passionate about climate and energy, says Wang. “That is why President Kornbluth made this her flagship initiative. We are fortunate to have so many talented students and faculty, and to be able to rely on our infrastructure. I know they will all step up to meet the challenges.” But she is quick to point out that the problems are too large for any one entity—including MIT—to address on its own. So she’s aiming to encourage more collaboration both among MIT researchers and with other institutions.

“If we want to solve this problem of climate change, if we want to change the trajectory in the next decade, we cannot continue to do business as usual,” she says. “That is what is most exciting about this problem and, frankly, is why I came back to campus to take this job.”

The coupling of climate and energy in Wang’s portfolio is strategic. “Energy and climate are two sides of the same coin,” she explains. “A major reason we are seeing climate change is that we haven’t deployed solutions at a scale necessary to mitigate the CO2 emissions from the energy sector. The ways we generate energy and manage emissions are fundamental to any strategy addressing climate change. At the same time, the world demands more and more energy—a demand we can’t possibly meet through a single means.”

“Zero-emissions and low-carbon approaches will not be enough to supply the necessary energy or to reverse our impact on the climate … We need to do something truly transformational. That is the heart of the challenge.”

What’s more, she contends that switching from fossil fuels to cleaner energy, while fundamental, is only part of the solution. “Zero-emissions and low-­carbon approaches will not be enough to supply the necessary energy or to reverse our impact on the climate,” she says. “We need to consider the environmental impacts of these new fuels we develop and deploy. We need to use data analysis to move goods and energy more efficiently and intelligently. We need to consider raising more of our food in water and using food by-products and waste to help sequester carbon. In short, we need to do something truly transformational. That is the heart of the challenge.”

That challenge seems destined to grow more daunting in the coming years. There are still, Wang observes, areas of “energy poverty”—places where people cannot access sufficient energy to sustain their well-being. But solving that problem will only drive up energy production and consumption worldwide. The explosive growth of AI will likely do the same, since the huge data centers that power the technology require enormous quantities of energy for both computation and cooling.

Wang believes that while AI will continue to drive electricity demand, it can also contribute to creating a more sustainable future.“We can use AI to develop climate and energy solutions,” she says. “AI can play a primary role in solution sets, can give us new and improved ways to manage intermittent loads in the energy grid. It can help us develop new catalysts and chemicals or help us stabilize the plasma we’ll use in nuclear fusion. It could augment climate and geospatial modeling that would allow us to predict the impact of potential climate solutions before we implement them. We could even use AI to reduce computational needs and thereby ease cooling demand.”

MIT was humming with climate and energy research long before Wang returned to campus in 2025 after wrapping up her work at ARPA-E. Almost 400 researchers across 90% of MIT’s departments responded to President Reif’s 2020 Climate Grand Challenges initiative. The Institute awarded $2.7 million to 27 finalist teams and identified five flagship projects, including one to create an early warning system to help mitigate the impact of climate disasters, another to predict and prepare for extreme weather events, and an ambitious project to slash nearly half of all industrial carbon emissions.

About 250 MIT faculty and senior researchers are now involved in the Climate Project at MIT, a campus-wide initiative launched in 2024 that works to generate and implement climate solutions, tools, and policy proposals. Conceived to bolster MIT’s already significant efforts as a leading source of technological, behavioral, and policy solutions to global climate issues, the Climate Project has identified six “missions”: decarbonizing energy and industry; preserving the atmosphere, land, and oceans; empowering frontline community action; designing resilient and prosperous cities; enabling new policy approaches; and wild cards, a catch-all category that supports development of unconventional solutions outside the scope of the other missions. Faculty members direct each mission.

With so much climate research already underway,a large part of Wang’s new role is to support and deepen existing projects. But to fully tap into MIT’s unique capabilities, she says, she’s aiming to foster some cultural shifts. And that begins with identifying ways to facilitate cooperation—both across the Institute and with external partners—on a scale that can make “something truly transformational” happen, she says. “At this stage, with the challenges we face in energy and climate, we need to do something ambitious.”

In Wang’s view, getting big results depends on taking a big-picture, holistic approach that will require unprecedented levels of collaboration. “MIT faculty have always treasured their independence and autonomy,” she says. “Traditionally, we’ve tried to let 1,000 flowers bloom. And traditionally we’ve done that well, often with outstanding results. But climate and energy are systems problems, which means we need to create a systems solution. How do we bring these diverse faculty together? How do we align their efforts, not just in technology, but also in policy, science, finance, and social sciences?”

To encourage MIT faculty to collaborate across departments, schools, and disciplines, Wang recently announced that the MIT Climate Project would award grants of $50,000 to $250,000 to collaborative faculty teams that work on six- to 24-month climate research projects. Student teams are invited to apply for research grants of up to $15,000.“We can’t afford to work in silos,” she says. “People from wildly diverse fields are working on the same problems and speaking different professional languages. We need to bring people together in an integrative way so we can attack the problem holistically.”

Wang also wants colleagues to reach beyond campus. MIT, she says, needs to form real, defined partnerships with other universities, as well as with industries, investors, and philanthropists. “This isn’t just an MIT problem,” she says. “Individual efforts and 1,000 flowers alone will not be enough to meet these challenges.”

Thinking holistically—and in terms of systems—will help focus efforts on the areas that will have the greatest impact. At a Climate Project presentation in October, Wang outlined an approach that would focus on building well-being within communities. This will begin with efforts to empower communities by developing coastal resilience, to decarbonize ports and shipping, and to design and build data centers that integrate smoothly and sustainably with nearby communities. She encouraged her colleagues to think in terms of big-picture solutions for the future and then to work on the components needed to build that future.

“As researchers, we sometimes jump to a solution before we have fully defined the problem,” she explains. “Let’s take the problem of decarbonization in transportation. The solution we’ve come up with is to electrify our vehicles. When we run up against the problem of the range of these vehicles, our first thought is to create higher-density batteries. But the real problem we’re facing isn’t about batteries. It’s about increasing the range of these vehicles. And the solution to that problem isn’t necessarily a more powerful battery.”

“Too often the narrative around climate is steeped in doom and gloom … The goal of any climate project is to build and protect well-being. How can we help communities thrive, empower people to live as they wish, even as the climate is changing?”

Wang is confident that her MIT colleagues have both the capacity and the desire to embrace the holistic approach she envisions. “When I was accepted to MIT as an undergraduate and visited the campus, the thing that made me certain I wanted to enroll here was the people,” she recalls. “They weren’t just talented. They had so many different interests. They were passionate about solving big problems. And they were eager to learn from one another. That spirit hasn’t changed. And that’s the spirit I and my team can tap into.”

Wang believes MIT and other institutions working on climate and energy solutions also need to change how we talk about the challenge. “Too often the narrative around climate is steeped in doom and gloom,” she says. “The underlying issue here is our well-being. That’s what we care about, not the climate. The goal of any climate project is to build and protect well-being. How can we help communities thrive, empower people to live as they wish, even as the climate is changing? How can we create conditions of resilience, sustainability, and prosperity? That is the framework I would like us to build on.” For example, in areas where extreme weather threatens homes or rising temperatures are harming human health, we should be developing affordable technologies that make dwellings more resilient and keep people cooler.

Wang’s colleagues at MIT concur with her assessment of the mission ahead. They also have a deep respect for her scholarship and leadership. “I couldn’t think of a better person to represent MIT’s diverse and powerful ability to attack climate,” says Susan Solomon, the Lee and Geraldine Martin Professor of Environmental Studies at MIT and recipient of the US National Medal of Science for her work on the Antarctic ozone hole. “Communicating MIT’s capabilities to provide what the nation needs—not only in engineering but also in … economics, the physical, chemical, and biological sciences, and much more—is an immense challenge.” But she’s confident that Wang will do it justice. “Evelyn is a consummate storyteller,” she says.

“She’s tremendously quick at learning new fields and driving toward what the real nuggets are that need to be addressed in solving hard problems,” says Elsa Olivetti, PhD ’07, the Jerry McAfee Professor in Engineering and director of the MIT Climate Project’s Decarbonizing Energy and Industry mission. “Her direct, meticulous thinking and leadership style mean that she can focus teams within her office to do the work that will be most impactful at scale.”

Wang’s experience at ARPA-E is expected to be especially useful. “The current geopolitical situation and the limited amount of research funding available relative to the scale of the climate problem pose formidable challenges to bringing MIT’s strengths to bear on the problem,” says Rohit Karnik, director of the Abdul Latif Jameel Water and Food Systems Lab (J-WAFS) and a collaborator with Wang on numerous projects and initiatives since both joined the mechanical engineering faculty in 2007. “Evelyn’s leadership experience at MIT and in government, her ability to take a complex situation and define a clear vision, and her passion to make a difference will serve her well in her new role.”

Wang’s new MIT appointment is seen as a good thing beyond the Institute as well. “A role like this requires a skill set that is difficult to find in one individual,” says Krista Walton, vice chancellor for research and innovation at North Carolina State University. Walton and Wang collaborated on multiple projects, including the DARPA work that produced the device for extracting water from very dry air based on the original prototype Wang co-developed. “You need scientific depth, an understanding of the federal and global landscape, a collaborative instinct and the ability to be a convener, and a strategic vision,” Walton says—and she can’t imagine a better pick for the job.

“Evelyn has an extraordinary ability to bridge fundamental science with real-world application,” she says. “She approaches collaboration as a true partnership and not as a transaction.”

Climate scientists explore broad swaths of time, tracking trends in temperature, greenhouse gases, volcanic activity, vegetation, and more across hundreds, thousands, and even millions of years. Even average temperatures and precipitation levels are calculated over periods of three decades.

But in the realm of politics, change happens much faster, prompting sudden and sometimes startling shifts in culture and policy. The current US administration has proposed widespread budget cuts in climate and energy research. These have included slicing more than $1.5 billion from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), canceling multiple climate-related missions at NASA, and shuttering the US Global Change Research Program (USGCRP), the agency responsible for publishing the National Climate Assessment. The Trump administration submitted a budget request that would cut the National Science Foundation budget from more than $9 billion to just over $4 billion for 2026. The New York Times reported that NSF grant funding for STEM education from January through mid-May 2025 was down 80% from its 10-year average, while NSF grant awards for math, physics, chemistry, astronomy, and materials science research were down 67%. In September, the US Department of Energy announced it had terminated 223 projects that “did not adequately advance the nation’s energy needs, were not economically viable, and would not provide a positive return on investment of taxpayer dollars.” Among the agencies affected is ARPA-E, the agency Wang directed before returning to MIT. Meanwhile, MIT research programs that rely on government sources of funding will also feel the impact of the cuts.

Acknowledging the difficulties she and MIT may face in the present moment, Wang still prefers to look forward. “Of course this is a challenging time,” she says. “There are near-term challenges and long-term challenges. We need to focus on those long-term challenges. As President Kornbluth has said, we need to continue to advocate for research and education. We need to pursue long-term solutions, to follow our convictions in addressing problems in energy and climate. And we need to be ready to seize the opportunities that reside in these long-term challenges.”

Wang also sees openings for short-term collaboration—areas where MIT and the current administration can find common ground and goals. “There is still a huge area of opportunity for us to align our interests with those of this administration,” she says. “We can move the needle forward together on energy, on national security, on minerals, on economic competitiveness. All these are interests we share, and there are pathways we can follow to meet these challenges to our nation together. MIT is a major force in the nuclear space, in both fission and fusion. These, along with geothermal, could provide the power base we need to meet our energy demands. There are significant opportunities for partnerships with this or any administration to unlock some of these innovations and implement them.”

While she views herself as a researcher and an academic, Wang’s relevant government experience should prove especially useful in her VP role at MIT. In her two years as director of ARPA-E, she coordinated a broad array of the US Department of Energy’s early-stage research and development in energy generation, storage, and use. “I think I had the best job in government,” she says. Designed to operate at arm’s length from the Department of Energy, ARPA-E searches for high-risk, high-reward energy innovation projects. “More than one observer has called ARPA-E a moonshot factory,” she says.

Seeking out and facilitating “moonshot”-­worthy projects at a national and sometimes global scale gave Wang a broader lens through which to view issues of energy and climate. It also taught her that big ideas do not translate into big solutions automatically. “I learned what it takes to make an impact on energy technology at ARPA-E and I will be forever grateful,” she says. “I saw how game-changing ideas can take a decade to go from concept to deployment. I learned to appreciate the diversity of talent and innovation in the national ecosystem composed of laboratories, startups, and institutions. I saw how that ecosystem could zero in to identify real problems, envision diverse pathways, and create prototypes. And I also saw just how hard that journey is.”

MIT researchers are tackling climate and energy issues from multiple angles, working on everything from decarbonizing energy and industry to designing resilient and prosperous cities. Find out more at climateproject.mit.edu.

While MIT is already an important element in that ecosystem, Wang and her colleagues want the Institute to play an even more prominent role. “We can be a convener and collaborator, first across all of MIT’s departments, and then with industry, the financial world, and governments,” she says. “We need to do aggressive outreach and find like-minded partners.”

“Although the problems of climate and climate change are global, the most effective way MIT can address them is locally,” said Wang at the October presentation of the MIT Climate Project. “Working across schools and disciplines, collaborating with external partners, we will develop targeted solutions for individual places and communities—solutions that can then serve as templates for other places and communities.” But she also cautions against one-size-fits-all solutions. “Solar panels, for example, work wonderfully, but only in areas that have sufficient space and sunlight,” she explains. “Institutions like MIT can showcase a diversity of approaches and determine the best approach for each individual context.”

Most of all, Wang wants her colleagues to be proactive. “Because MIT is a factory of ideas, perhaps even a moonshot factory, we need to think boldly and continue to think boldly so we can make an impact as soon as possible,” she says. She also wants her colleagues to stay hopeful and not feel daunted by a challenge that can at times feel overwhelming. “We will build pilots, one at a time, and demonstrate that these projects are not only possible but practical,” she says. “And that is how we will build a future everyone wants to live in.”

            <div id="article-text">Few people, if any, contemplate stars—celestial or cinematic—the way Aomawa Shields does.

An astronomer and astrobiologist, Shields explores the potential habitability of planets beyond our solar system. But she is also a classically trained actor—and that’s helped shape her professional trajectory in unexpected ways.

Today, Shields is an associate professor in the Department of Physics and Astronomy at the University of California, Irvine, where she oversees a research team that uses computer models to explore conditions on exoplanets, or planets that revolve around stars other than the sun. But while searching for life many light-years away is her day job, creative endeavors round out her purpose on Earth.

In 2023 Shields published a memoir, Life on Other Planets: A Memoir of Finding My Place in the Universe. She has started an influential educational program that encourages young girls to explore space, given a hugely popular TED Talk about how we’ll find life on other planets, and won a string of prestigious academic awards, honors, and grants. She also plays the violin, cooks, practices yoga, and is a mom. And as what she calls a “rest leader”—a professional proponent of slowing down—Shields has somehow managed the seemingly impossible: She makes time.

Her unorthodox path began on the screen, in the realm of make-believe.

“I wanted to become an astronaut. That dream started very early in my life, at the age of 12, after seeing a movie that dramatized kids getting launched into space,” she says, referring to SpaceCamp, an ’80s kids’ comedy about an accidental space shuttle flight.

The next bit of cinematic inspiration cemented her interest.

“Charlotte Blackwood was an astrophysicist, and she was very glamorous, too,” Shields says, smiling at how she was captivated by the heroine in Top Gun. “There’s an iconic scene where she’s walking down the aisle between Tom Cruise and other pilot trainees, and she just kind of whips off her glasses and just looks like such a badass.”

A high-achieving student while growing up in California, Canada, and Massachusetts, Shields made her way to Phillips Exeter Academy, in large part drawn by its state-of-the-art astronomical observatory. Once there, she got pulled into acting in a serious way. “Enter a new dream,” she says.

Throughout high school her astronomy and acting aspirations “kind of danced beside each other,” Shields remembers. “But I held firm to the first one and went to MIT because I understood that it’s the best science school in the country. I learned that at the age of 12—that’s where I’m going to go.”

At MIT, Shields struggled academically at first and took refuge in the creative arts. She was chosen to participate in the Burchard Scholars Program, whose monthly dinner seminars bring faculty members together with students who excel in the arts, social sciences, and humanities. She sang in the a cappella group the Muses and performed in lots of plays. At the end of her senior year, she found herself wondering: “Do I go to grad school in acting or astronomy?”

“There were a lot of these things that seemed to be aligning—that were telling me: Go back and get that PhD.”

The latter won out, but not for long. Shields headed to a graduate program in astronomy at the University of Wisconsin–Madison. “During that year, I had a white male professor tell me to consider other career options, and that was hard to hear,” she says. She remembers thinking, “I’m going to the other dream because clearly someone’s telling me that I don’t belong here. Maybe they’re right.”

So she applied to UCLA, where she got an MFA in acting, leaving astronomy for more than a decade. But then, when Shields was working odd jobs to supplement her acting gigs, a mentor from her undergraduate years encouraged her to look on a Caltech-operated job website. She saw an opening for a help desk operator at the Spitzer Space Telescope, an infrared telescope that is particularly adept at viewing the formation of young stars—and it only required a bachelor’s degree. “I’d refer the harder questions to the PhDs,” she says. “But by taking that job, I got to go to astronomy talks again … This field of exoplanets had just exploded during the time I’d been away.”

Shields had some success in acting, including a part in a film called Nine Lives, which screened at the Sundance Film Festival. But a big break—and then heartbreak—came after she was cast as the host of the show Wired Science, only to lose the job when the producers decided to change presenters. It was a “devastating moment,” she says.

Soon after, she emailed the astrophysicist and science communications luminary Neil deGrasse Tyson, whom she’d been introduced to over email by an astronomer working with the Spitzer Space Telescope, and relayed what had happened. He replied that he’d seen her in the pilot and told her that “without a PhD you don’t have that street cred if you want to do science television,” she recalls. Meanwhile, she had applied to NASA’s astronaut candidate program but didn’t make it past the first level. (She did, however, get to play an astronaut in a recent Toyota ad.) “There were a lot of these things that seemed to be aligning—that were telling me: Go back and get that PhD,” she says. So she did, earning her doctorate in astronomy and astrobiology in 2014 from the University of Washington.

Astrobiology, Shields explains, is a relatively new field that studies the origin, evolution, and distribution of life in the universe: “It’s about how life got started on Earth.”

Astrobiologists might focus on the habitability of planets, or on methods for exploring life on other planets, or on liquids other than water that could support life. It’s a highly interdisciplinary field. “There are astronomers that are looking for these planets and are using their particular field of expertise to answer that question: Are we alone?” Shields explains. Some of them are “also chemists and biologists and oceanographers and geologists who tackle these questions from their own lens and specific area of expertise,” she says. “That’s why I love it. As an astrobiologist, we don’t have to get 15 PhDs. We get to collaborate with people in different departments who lend their own expertise … on those science questions.”

Shields is trying to answer a question sparked by the night sky—one that’s deeply personal yet universal in both the astronomical and the colloquial sense. “Ever since I was a little girl, I would look up at the sky and wonder what was out there,” she says. “It comes from a sense of wonder for me. I still have that feeling when I look up at the night sky and I see these little pinpoints of light. I wonder: Is there anyone looking back at me? … How far does space go?”

There are, she explains, 100 billion stars in our galaxy, most orbited by at least one planet, and over 100 billion galaxies beyond ours. That’s about 1022 stars in the universe. The likelihood that only Earth was able to produce life “I think is pretty low,” Shields says.

“I’m looking for planetary environments that could be conducive to life beyond Earth,” she says. “And my team does that largely using climate models. These are the same kinds of models that can predict climate and weather on Earth.”

Shields plugs information gathered by observational astronomers into such models, along with different potential combinations of other, unknown variables—like the type of light a planet receives from its host star, the composition of its atmosphere and surface, and certain orbital information. “There’s only so much that you can really tell about a planet from the telescope information that you get,” she explains. “We can explore that parameter space with climate models and say: Okay, if it has this surface composition, this is what the temperature would be like on this planet. If it has this atmospheric composition, this type of orbit, this is what the climate would be like, and this is how habitable it would be across its surface.”

Since the early 1990s, astronomers have discovered 6,000 exoplanets. Shields says those in Earth’s size range—in which she’s most interested—number in the hundreds. A smaller subset of those are orbiting in what’s called the “habitable zone” of their star, creating warm enough conditions to maintain water in liquid form—the key to life. So far, as many as 100 or so planets that fall into that category have been identified, but the James Webb Space Telescope, launched in 2021, could find even more potentially habitable planets by detecting “biosignatures” suggesting a biological presence, such as particular gases in their atmospheres or glints that might be reflections of water on the planetary surface.

Being able to detect more of these sorts of signals, Shields says, is the next “big mission” in astronomy.

Today, in her academic work, her mind hurtles to the farthest reaches of the universe. But in her precious hours outside of academia, she has learned to be still. When her work schedule started to overwhelm her, Shields’s health began to suffer. Then she discovered the practice of yoga nidra—an ancient form of meditation in which practitioners are guided into a deeply restful “yogic sleep.” Shields read the book Do Less: A Revolutionary Approach to Time and Energy Management for Ambitious Women, which claims that 20 or 30 minutes of yoga nidra “feels like three hours of sleep in your body,” she says. “And as the mother of a young child, I was like: Okay, sign me up!”

Last year she trained with Karen Brody, author of Daring to Rest: Reclaim Your Power with Yoga Nidra Rest Meditation, and became a certified facilitator. “It’s been important to me to share it broadly and to really try to do my part to introduce the culture of academia, in particular, to this notion of resting as a daily practice,” she says. Now she’s at work on a book about her attempt to moderate—to resist the temptation to take on too much. She has learned to decline invitations and put firm boundaries between her work and personal life.

Shields has realized that her seemingly disparate interests in astronomy and acting don’t have to be mutually exclusive. Combining them makes her a more effective educator.

On a weekday in August, an ayurvedic soup simmers on her kitchen stove. A music stand occupies the corner of a room where she sometimes picks up her violin and plays fiddle tunes. (Her parents, both professional musicians, derived her name from a chant of vowel sounds they made up.) She mentions the poem “swim | women of color”by Nayyirah Waheed and recites it in a soft, rich voice. Part of it goes: “This structure counts on your inability to say no. mean no. they take no from our first breath. go back and return it to your mouth. your heart. your light.”

“I need to graciously let go or say no—make room for someone else to say yes,” Shields says. “That allows me to have more spaciousness in my schedule, because one thing I’ve discovered is that women of color, as we proceed up the academic ladder, the requests just exponentially increase, and so saying no is not simply an important skill—it’s a survival skill.”

Along the way, Shields has come to realize that her seemingly disparate interests in astronomy and acting don’t have to be mutually exclusive. In fact, combining them—and sharing her passion for both—makes her a more effective educator. Her training as an actor helps her craft lectures that keep students engaged and animates her presentations, including her TED Talk, in a way that resonates with nonscientists.

Shields is also tapping into her love of acting to inspire the next generation of scientists who will help answer astronomy’s big questions. As part of a postdoctoral fellowship through the National Science Foundation, she was asked to design an educational outreach component. “I was like: Is there a scenario in which I could use acting to teach astronomy?” she says. “And I looked it up. There was precedent for that. Astronomy education journals had shown that when you involve girls in creative arts—theater, writing—and you incorporate that into astronomy education, you increase girls’ confidence in both asking and answering questions.”

The finding resonated with her own experience. After all, it was acting—which she turned to when her professor discouraged her from studying astronomy—that gave her the confidence to pursue astronomy again. “I looked at acting as this outlet, this safe space,” she says. “Nobody could tell me that I was wrong as an actor.”

With that in mind, Shields launched Rising Stargirls, which holds workshops using the creative arts to teach astronomy to ­middle-school-aged girls of all backgrounds. She and her colleagues have since published a study showing that girls who attended the program reported being more excited to take science classes and were more likely to believe they could do well in science.

“We want them to know that who they are is inherently pivotal and critical to their study and practice of astronomy,” Shields says. “The sciences are incredibly creative, and they get to bring that creative imagination and creative inspiration they find through the arts into learning about the universe.”

That same exchange has played out in Shields’s life, but it’s only recently that she’s come to see similarities between her roles as an astronomer and an actor. “They’re both about story,” she says.

Actors have to convey the arc or evolution of a story through the lives of their characters. “Stars, ­planets—they have lives, too,” Shields says. “They have births, they have evolution, and they die. It’s my job as a scientist to unveil the story—to discover the story of whether there’s life elsewhere.”

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Ever since nuclear fusion was discovered in the 1930s, scientists have wondered if we could somehow replicate and harness the phenomenon behind starlight—the smashing together of hydrogen atoms to form helium and a stupendous amount of clean energy. Fusing hydrogen would yield 200 million times more energy than simply burning it. Unlike nuclear fission, which powers the world’s 440 atomic reactors, hydrogen fusion produces no harmful radiation, only neutrons that are captured and added back to the reaction. Instead of radioactive wastes with long, lethal half-lives, fusion’s by-product is helium, the most stable element—and a year’s worth from a fusion plant wouldn’t supply a party balloon business.

Dennis Whyte’s part in the fusion quest began in graduate school, in a lab belonging to the electric utility Hydro-Québec, just outside Montreal. There he was shown a device built to replicate stellar fusion on an earthly scale. It was a doughnut-shaped hollow chamber, big enough for a lanky physicist like him to stand inside, based on a design conceived in 1950 by the future Nobel Peace Prize laureate Andrei Sakharov, who also developed hydrogen bombs for the Soviet Union. It was called a tokamak, a word derived from a Russian phrase meaning “ring-shaped chamber with magnetic coils.”

The idea is straightforward: Fill the doughnut with hydrogen gas, and then heat that gas until it turns to electrically charged plasma. In this ionic state, plasma would be held in place by magnets positioned around the tokamak. Achieving fusion on Earth without the immense pressure of a star’s interior, scientists calculated, would require temperatures nearly 10 times hotter than our sun’s center—around 100 million degrees Celsius. So the trick would be to suspend the hot plasma so perfectly in a surrounding magnetic field that it wouldn’t touch inner surfaces of the chamber. Such contact would instantly cool it, stopping the fusion reaction.

The good part about that was safety. In a failure, a fusion power plant wouldn’t melt down—just the opposite. The bad part was that gaseous plasma wasn’t very cooperative—any slight irregularity in the chamber walls could cause destabilizing turbulence. But the concept was so tantalizing that by the mid-1980s, 75 universities and governmental institutes around the world had tokamaks. If anyone could get fusion—the most energy-dense reaction in the universe—to work, the deuterium in a liter of seawater could meet one person’s electricity needs for a year. It would be, effectively, a limitless resource.

Besides turbulence, there were two other big obstacles. The magnets surrounding the plasma needed to be really powerful—meaning really big. In 1986, 35 nations representing half the world’s population—including the US, China, India, Japan, what is now the entire European Union, South Korea, and Russia—agreed to jointly build the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor, a $40 billion giant tokamak in southern France. Standing 100 feet tall on a 180-acre site, ITER (the acronym also formed the Latin word for “journey”) is equipped with 18 magnets weighing 360 tons apiece, made from the best superconductors then available. If it works, ITER will produce 500 megawatts of electricity—but not before 2035, if then. It’s still under construction. The second obstacle is the biggest: Many tokamaks have briefly achieved fusion, but doing so always took more energy than they produced.

After earning his doctorate in 1992, Whyte worked on an ITER prototype at San Diego’s National Fusion Facility, taught at the University of Wisconsin, and in 2006 was hired by MIT. By then, he understood how huge the stakes were, and how life-changing commercial-scale fusion energy could be—if it could be sustained, and if it could be produced affordably.

MIT had been trying since 1969. The red brick buildings of its Plasma Science and Fusion Center, where Whyte came to work, had originally housed the National Biscuit Company. PSFC’s sixth tokamak, Alcator C-Mod, built in 1991, was in Nabisco’s old Oreo cookie factory. C-Mod’s magnets were coiled with copper to serve as a conductor (think of how copper wire wrapped around a nail and connected to a battery turns it into an electromagnet). Before C-Mod was finally decommissioned, its magnetic fields, 160,000 times stronger than Earth’s, set the world record for the highest plasma pressure in a tokamak.

As Ohm’s law describes, however, metals like copper have internal resistance, so it could run for only four seconds before overheating—and needed more energy to ignite its fusion reactions than what came out of it. Like the now 160 similar tokamaks around the world, C-Mod was an interesting science experiment but mainly reinforced the joke that fusion energy was 20 years away and always would be.

Each year, Whyte had challenged PhD students in his fusion design classes to conjure something just as compact as C-Mod, one-800th the scale of ITER, that could achieve and sustain fusion—with an energy gain. But in 2013, as he neared 50, he increasingly had doubts. He’d devoted his career to the fusion dream, but unless something radically changed, he feared it wouldn’t happen in his lifetime.

The US Department of Energy decided to scale back on fusion. It informed MIT that funding for Alcator C-Mod would end in 2016. So Whyte decided he would either quit fusion and do something else or try something different to get there faster.

There was a new generation of ceramic “high-temperature” superconductors, not available when ITER’s huge magnets were being wrapped in metallic superconducting cable, which has to be chilled to 4 kelvin above absolute zero (–452.47 °F) for its resistance to current to fall to zero. Discovered accidentally in 1986 in a Swiss lab, the new ceramic superconductors still needed to be cooled to 20 K (–423.7 °F). But with far smaller power requirements, their output was so much greater that a year later the discoverers won a Nobel Prize.

The potential applications were limitless, but because ceramic is so brittle, coiling it around electromagnets wasn’t feasible. Then one day Whyte ran into research scientist Leslie Bromberg ’73, PhD ’77, in the hallway holding a fistful of what resembled unspooled tape from a VCR cassette. “What’s all that?” he asked.

“Superconducting tape, new stuff.” The filmy strips were coated with ceramic crystals of rare-earth barium copper oxide. “It’s called ReBCO,” Bromberg said.

ReBCO’s rare-earth component, yttrium, is 400 times more common than silver. Could superconducting tape, Whyte immediately wondered, be wound like copper wire to make much smaller but far more powerful magnets?

The class met in a windowless room in a former Nabisco cracker factory, surrounded by blackboards.

He assigned his 2013 fusion design class to see. If the students managed to double the strength of a magnetic field surrounding hot plasma, he knew, they might multiply fusion’s power density sixteenfold. They came up with an eye-­opening design they called Vulcan. It yielded five peer-reviewed papers—but whether layers of wound ReBCO tape could stand the stress of the current needed to hold plasma suspended while being superheated to ignite a fusion reaction was unknown.

For two years, his classes refined Vulcan. By 2015, with ReBCO more consistent in quality and supply, he challenged his students—11 male and one female, including an Argentine, a Russian, and a Korean—to outdo what 35 nations had been attempting for nearly 30 years.

“Let’s see if ReBCO lets us build a 500-megawatt tokamak—the same as ITER, only way smaller.”

If superconducting tape could let them make a fusion reactor to fit the footprint of a decommissioned coal-fired plant, he told them, it could plug right into existing power lines. To then make enough carbon-­free energy to stop pushing Earth’s climate past the edge, its components would have to be mass-­producible, so any competent contractor could assemble and service them.

The class met in a windowless room in a former Nabisco cracker factory, surrounded by blackboards. Divided into teams, the students set about figuring out how thin-tape electromagnets could be made robust, and how to capture neutrons expelled from fusion reactions so their heat could be used for turning a turbine—and so they could be harnessed to breed more tritium for the plasma. That’s crucial, because natural tritium is exceedingly rare. Since ReBCO-wrapped magnets would be so much smaller, shrinking the dimensions of one component rippled through everything else. One team’s innovations fed another’s, and parts of the design started to link together. As excitement spread through PSFC, members of earlier classes, now postdocs or faculty members, pitched in. Whyte’s students, some with doctoral dissertations due, were putting in 50-hour weeks on this, reminding him of why he’d dreamed of fusion in first place.

Whyte looked it over for the thousandth time. He was pretty sure they hadn’t broken any laws of physics.

And then, at the semester’s end, out popped their design. Just over 10 feet in diameter, it actually looked like a prototype power plant. While ITER had massive shielding, their tokamak would be wrapped in a compact blanket containing a molten-salt mixture of lithium fluoride and beryllium fluoride to absorb the heat of the neutrons escaping from the fusion reaction. Those neutrons would also react with the lithium to breed more tritium.

The blanket’s heat would be tapped for electricity—except one-fifth of the heat energy would remain in the plasma, meaning the reaction was now heating itself and was self-sustaining, producing more energy than was needed to ignite it. Net fusion energy had been achieved.

The ReBCO magnets, although just a 40th the size of ITER’s, could deliver a magnetic field strength of 23 tesla (a hospital MRI machine typically operates at 1.5 tesla). That was more than enough to achieve a fusion reaction, yet it would require less electricity than its copper-clad C-Mod predecessor by a factor of 2,000. Everything was designed for easy maintenance, and parts could be replaced without having to dismantle the entire reactor.

Most important, the calculated energy output was more than 13 times the input.

Whyte looked it over for the thousandth time. He was pretty sure they hadn’t broken any laws of physics. He calculated the cost per watt and was astonished. Suddenly their goal wasn’t just building a much smaller ITER. It was being commercially competitive.

Stunned, he told his wife, “This can actually work.”

They called it ARC, for “affordable, robust, compact.” “Buildable in a decade,” Whyte predicted.The peer-reviewed article his 12 students published in FusionEngineering and Design estimated it would cost around $5 billion. In 2015, that wasn’t much more than the cost of a comparably sized coal-fired plant, and one-eighth ITER’s price tag.

That May, Whyte gave a keynote about ARC at a fusion engineering symposium in Austin, Texas. Four of his students attended. When he described their plan for a workable reactor by 2025, in just 10 years, conferees were astounded—everyone else was talking decades. Afterward, the MIT contingent went to lunch at Stubb’s Bar-B-Q. It was clear that with the climate eroding and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change warning that yet-­uninvented technologies were needed to keep temperatures from soaring into dreaded realms, they had to do this. But since the DOE had pulled its funding, how could they?

On a napkin, Whyte started listing what they’d need to do and what each step might cost. Over ribs, they crafted a proposal to spin off a startup to raise venture capital to finance a SPARC (for “soon-as-possible ARC”) demo fusion reactor to show that this could really happen. Then they’d build a commercial-scale ARC.

Forming a company would free them from academic and government funding cycles, but they were plasma physicists, most still in their 20s, without business backgrounds. Nevertheless, Whyte and Martin Greenwald, deputy director of the PSFC, agreed to join them, and in 2018 Commonwealth Fusion Systems, CFS, was born. Three of his former students would run the company, and three would remain at MIT’s Plasma Science and Fusion Center, which—in a profit-sharing agreement—would be CFS’s research arm.

They opened shop up the street, in The Engine, MIT’s “tough tech” startup incubator, and gained the attention of climate-concerned backers like Bill Gates, George Soros, and Jeff Bezos. But they weren’t the only ones competing for fusion funds, and it became a race to see who could make commercial-scale fusion first.

The CFS team may have been young, but because of its partnership with MIT and its more than a hundred experienced fusion scientists, it had a running start.

By the end of 2021, Commonwealth Fusion Systems had raised more than $2 billion and was breaking ground on 47 acres outside Boston for a commercial fusion energy campus, to build SPARC by 2025—and commercial-scale, mass-­producible ARC by 2030.

Gaining and actually sustaining net energy is perpetually called fusion’s yet-unreached “holy grail,” but by September 2021, the CFS team of CEO Bob Mumgaard, SM ’15, PhD ’15 (a coauthor of the Vulcan design), chief science officer Brandon Sorbom, PhD ’17 (lead author of the 2015 fusion design class’s breakthrough paper), Whyte, and their 200 CFS colleagues were confident they could do it—if their magnets held. For three years, straight through the pandemic, they’d worked in PSFC’s West Cell laboratory, the cavernous former Oreo factory that had housed Alcator C-Mod, furiously solving problems like how to solder thin-film ReBCO tape together into a structure strong enough to withstand 40,000 amps passing through it—enough to power a small town.

The completed SPARC would have 18 magnets encircling its plasma chamber, but for this test they’d built just one. It was composed of 16 layers, each a D-shaped, 10-foot-high steel disk grooved like an LP. On one side, the grooves held tight spirals of ReBCO film, 270 kilometers in all—the distance from Boston to Albany. “Yet all that ReBCO holds just a sprinkling of rare earth,” said Sorbom. “That’s the magic of superconductors: A tiny bit of material can carry so much current. By comparison, a wind turbine’s rare-earth neodymium magnets weigh tons.”

On each disk’s flip side, the grooves channeled liquid helium to cool the superconductor for zero resistance. (The design dates to history’s first high-field magnet, built at MIT in the 1930s, which used copper conductors and water for coolant.) Each layer was built on an automated assembly line. “The idea,” said Mumgaard, “is to make 100,000 magnets a year someday. This can’t be a scientific curiosity. This needs to be an energy source.”

Although covid-19 had waned, an outbreak could foil everything, so they maintained coronavirus protocols, moving computer terminals outside beneath a tent to avoid crowding within. Others worked virtually. For a month, dozens worked eight-hour, continuous shifts. Some operated the electromagnetic coil, encased in stainless steel in the middle of the room, which over a week had to be gradually supercooled from room temperature of 298 K down to 20 K before slowly ramping up to full magnetic strength. Others constantly compared real-time data with redundant models. As the temperature dropped, the internal connections, welds, and valves contracted at different rates, so they watched for leaks.

On September 2, 2021, the Thursday before Labor Day, they started ramping up by a few kiloamps, stopping frequently to check what the current was revealing, how the cooling characteristics had changed, and how the stresses on the ReBCO coil increased as the magnetic field strengthened to record heights.

Two nights later, they cranked the amperage toward their goal: a 20-tesla magnetic field, powerful enough to lift 421 Boeing 747s or contain a continuous fusion reaction. They’d been aiming for 7:00 a.m. on Sunday, the 5th. At 3:30, the large screen in the design center showed that they’d reached 40 kiloamps, and the magnetic field had reached 19.56 tesla.

At 4:30 a.m., they were at 19.98 tesla. Things got very quiet. At 5:20 a.m., every redundant on-screen meter read 20 tesla, and nothing had leaked or exploded—except under the tent, where champagne corks were popping.

Five years earlier, on its final four-­second run, C-Mod’s copper-conducting magnet had consumed 200 million watts of energy to reach 5.7 tesla. This took 30 watts—less energy by a factor of around 10 million, Whyte told reporters—to produce a magnetic field strong enough to sustain a fusion reaction. The joints that transferred current from one layer to the next actually performed better than expected. That was the biggest unknown, because there was only one way to test them: in the magnet itself. They looked spectacular.

After five hours, the team ramped down the power. “It’s a Kitty Hawk moment,” Mumgaard said.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The AI industry has become adept at measuring itself. Benchmarks improve, model scores rise, and every new release arrives with a list of metrics meant to signal progress. And yet, somewhere between the lab and real life, something keeps slipping.

Which model actually feels better to use?
Which answers would a human trust?
Which system would you put in front of customers, employees, or citizens and feel comfortable standing behind it?

That gap is where LMArena has quietly built its business, and why investors just put $150 million behind it at a $1.7 billion valuation, in a Series A round. The lead investors were Felicis and UC Investments, with participation from major venture firms (Andreessen Horowitz, Kleiner Perkins, Lightspeed, The House Fund, Laude Ventures).

For years, benchmarks were the currency of AI credibility: accuracy scores, reasoning tests and standardized datasets. They worked until they didn’t. As models grew larger and more similar, benchmark improvements became marginal. Worse, models began to optimize for the tests themselves rather than real use cases. Static evaluations struggled to reflect how AI behaves in open-ended, messy human interactions.

At the same time, AI systems moved out of labs and into everyday workflows: drafting emails, writing code, powering customer support, assisting with research and advising professionals. The question shifted from “Can the model do this?” to “Should we trust it when it does?”

That’s a different kind of measurement problem.

LMArena’s answer was simple and radical: stop scoring models in isolation. On its platform, users submit a prompt and receive two anonymized responses. No branding. No model names. Just answers. Then the user picks the better one, or neither.

One vote. One comparison. Repeated millions of times.

The result isn’t a definitive “best,” but a living signal of human preference , how people respond to tone, clarity, verbosity and real-world usefulness. When the prompt isn’t clean or predictable, that signal changes. And it captures something benchmarks often miss.

LMArena isn’t about whether a model produces a factually correct answer. It’s about whether humans prefer it when it does. That distinction is subtle but meaningful in practice. Rankings on the Arena leaderboard are now referenced by developers and labs before releases and product decisions. Major models from OpenAI, Google and Anthropic are regularly evaluated there.

Without traditional marketing, LMArena became a mirror the industry watches.

The $150 million round isn’t just a vote of confidence in LMArena’s product. It signals that AI evaluation itself is becoming infrastructure. As the number of models explodes, enterprise buyers face a new question: not how to get AI, but which AI to trust. Vendor claims and classical benchmarks don’t always translate to real-world reliability. Internal testing is expensive and slow.

A neutral, third-party signal, something that sits between model builders and users  is emerging as a critical layer. That’s where LMArena lives. In September 2025, it launched AI Evaluations, a commercial service that turns its crowdsourced comparison engine into a product enterprises and labs can pay to access. LMArena says this service achieved an annualized run rate of about $30 million within months of launch.

For regulators and policymakers, this kind of human-anchored signal matters too. Oversight frameworks need evidence that reflects real usage, not idealized scenarios.

LMArena’s approach isn’t without debate. Platforms that rely on public voting and crowdsourced signals can reflect the preferences of active users, which may not align with the needs of specific professional domains. In response, competitors like Scale AI’s SEAL Showdown have emerged, aiming to offer more granular, representative model rankings across languages, regions and professional contexts.

Academic research also notes that voting-based leaderboards can be susceptible to manipulation if safeguards aren’t in place, and that such systems may favor superficially appealing responses over technically correct ones if quality control isn’t rigorous.

These debates highlight that no single evaluation method captures every dimension of model behavior, but they also underscore the demand for richer, human-grounded signals beyond traditional benchmarks.

There’s a quiet assumption in AI that trust will emerge naturally as models improve. Better reasoning, so the logic goes, will lead to better outcomes. That framing treats alignment as a technical problem with technical solutions.

LMArena challenges that idea. Trust, in real contexts, is social and contextual. It’s built through experience, not claims. It’s shaped by feedback loops that don’t collapse under scale. By letting users, not companies, decide what works, LMArena introduces friction where the industry often prefers momentum. It slows things down just enough to ask, “Is this actually better, or just newer?”

That’s an uncomfortable question in a market driven by constant release cycles. It’s also why LMArena’s rise feels inevitable.

LMArena doesn’t promise safety. It doesn’t declare models good or bad. It doesn’t replace regulation or responsibility. What it does is simpler and more powerful: it keeps score in public. As AI systems become embedded in everyday decisions, tracking performance over time becomes less optional. Someone has to notice regressions, contextual shifts and usability patterns.

In sports, referees and statisticians fill this role. In markets, auditors and rating agencies do. In AI, we’re still inventing that infrastructure.

LMArena’s funding round suggests investors believe this role won’t stay marginal for long. Because when AI is everywhere, the hardest questions aren’t what it can do. They are who we trust when it does it, and how we know we’re right.

            <div id="article-text">For years, the tech industry equated success with scale. Bigger stages, larger crowds, more logos, more panels, more noise. Five thousand people became ten thousand. Ten thousand became the goal.

Somewhere along the way, that stopped making sense.

Founders and executives didn’t announce a boycott. They simply stopped showing up.

What we see today is not a rejection of events, but a correction in how people who actually run companies choose to spend their time. The shift is subtle, but consistent. Fewer large conferences. More small, curated gatherings. More closed rooms. More dinners. More tables of twelve.

Big tech events struggle because they optimize for visibility, not usefulness. A founder does not need three days of generic content, dozens of panels with no real interaction, or networking sessions where relevance is left to chance.

At scale, everything becomes superficial by default. Conversations shorten. Access disappears. The signal is drowned by the format itself.

What founders look for instead is simple. Context. Trust. Direct access. Conversations without performance. The kind of environment where people can speak honestly, not publicly.

Even when larger conferences still make sense, there is a clear psychological ceiling. Around one thousand participants, in exceptional cases. Beyond that point, quality becomes impossible to control. The event stops being a place where decisions are made and turns into a product designed for mass consumption.

And tech, especially at the founder and executive level, no longer behaves like a mass industry. It behaves like a precision one.

This is why smaller, niche conferences outperform larger ones on every meaningful metric. Ten relevant people in a room will always create more value than a thousand irrelevant ones in a hall.

At a small table, access is natural. No one needs to chase anyone. Trust forms faster. Real conversations happen because there is no audience to impress.

The most important discussions in tech have never happened on stage. They happen before the lights turn on and after the microphones are off.

In parallel with this shift, we have been preparing a private community limited to one thousand founders and executives. It is strictly invite only. Not a platform. Not a public group. Not designed for scale. Designed for relevance. Quality is protected precisely by limitation.

One thing we can say publicly is that TNW will return with an event in 2026. Details, format, and the official launch will be announced soon, but not here. What matters is that this return will not mirror the old model. It will reflect how the industry actually operates today.

Big events are not disappearing. They are simply no longer where important decisions are made.

Across the industry, the shift is already happening. Smaller rooms. Sharper conversations. People who actually need to be there.

            <div id="article-text">Five stars used to mean something. People still read reviews before buying software. They just don’t trust them the way they used to. And no, this isn’t about fake reviews or obvious scams. Those are easy to spot. The real problem is more uncomfortable. The review economy didn’t collapse. It slowly drifted away from its original purpose.

User reviews began as authentic buyer guidance, but they’ve morphed into strategic assets for businesses. Scroll through any app store or e-commerce site: everything is “top-rated” and lavished with praise. If every product gleams with a 4.8/5 rating, those stars start to lose their meaning.

Consumers aren’t fooled, in fact, the share of people who trust online reviews as much as personal recommendations plummeted from nearly 80% in 2020 to just 42% in 2025

We read the glowing comments, but we’ve learned to read between the lines.

TNW City Coworking space - Where your best work happens

A workspace designed for growth, collaboration, and endless networking opportunities in the heart of tech.

It’s not hard to see why trust has eroded. Companies have figured out that great reviews drive sales, so they’ve turned the whole system into a numbers game. High ratings aren’t just social proof now, they’re a growth tactic.  In other words, more stars = more money. So of course businesses are chasing stars like their life depends on it. And in a way, it does.

Behind the scenes, many companies actively engineer their review scores. One common tactic is to time the ask just right. For instance, some businesses send out a Net Promoter Score (NPS) survey to gauge your sentiment “How likely are you to recommend us?”

If you rate them a 9 or 10 (a promoter), you’re immediately nudged to post a public review. If you give a lukewarm or low score, the feedback form quietly thanks you and never mentions writing a review at all.

Only the happiest customers get the gentle push to “Share your experience!” This practice is so widespread it even has a name: “review gating.”

It’s essentially filtering which customers get invited to leave a review based on their initial feedback. Platforms officially frown on it (Google outright forbids “selectively soliciting positive reviews”), but behind closed doors it remains a growth hacker’s favorite trick.

Then there’s the outright incentivization. Perhaps you’ve received an email offering a discount, gift card, or free month of service in exchange for writing a review. It’s framed as a thank-you for your time, of course – “Share your honest feedback and get 10% off your next purchase!” – but the intent is clear.

In an economy of fake praise, even regulators have had to step in to remind everyone that trust isn’t a commodity to be bought. Companies know how to play the game from the other side too: suppressing negativity.

Unhappy customer feedback is quietly diverted to support teams or private channels, where it can be resolved (or simply contained) out of public view. The result is a skewed reality, a glossy wall of five-star testimonials that obscure any hint of dissatisfaction. It’s a great sales tool. It’s terrible for the truth.

Why go to such lengths to manicure the ratings? Because the platforms themselves reward it. The algorithms that sort and highlight products aren’t trying to surface the most truthful review; they’re trying to maximize engagement and conversion.

High ratings and large volumes of reviews make people more likely to click “Buy Now.” That means more conversion for sellers and more commission for the marketplace. In other words, the algorithm is biased toward whatever boosts the platform’s monetization metrics.

A bunch of five-star reviews isn’t just ego bait,  it’s algorithm bait.

Think about it: products with a 4.7-star average and hundreds of reviews tend to appear at the top of search results and recommendation lists. They convert better, so the system pushes them more.

More visibility leads to more sales, which reinforces the high ranking. It’s a feedback loop powered by positive feedback (pun intended). If a vendor can game their way into that virtuous cycle, via perfectly timed prompts or purchased praise, the platform’s code will happily amplify them.

Authenticity doesn’t earn you a top slot; performance does. The incentive is clear: keep it positive, and keep it plentiful. In the review economy, volume and sentiment are king.

Worse, some marketplaces have blurred the line between genuine high-rated listings and paid placement. It’s an open secret that many platforms offer sponsored spots or pay-to-play schemes, think “featured” placements, ads masquerading as top picks, or vendor subscriptions that subtly boost visibility.

Money talks, even if it speaks over the voice of authentic customer feedback. (To be fair, a few holdouts still refuse to monetize their review rankings or sell out their star system, but they’re the exception, not the rule).

Consumers aren’t sitting idly by in this charade. We’ve become savvy at sniffing out over-polished BS. The modern buyer knows how the game is played, and many are adapting their behavior to cope with the broken review system.

First, there’s a migration of trust to private networks and off-platform channels. Instead of relying on the star-average on a marketplace, people turn to friends, colleagues, and niche communities for real advice.

Think about the last time you were unsure about a purchase, maybe you shot a quick message to a group chat, or asked in a private Slack channel, “Hey, has anyone used this product? Is it actually any good?” Personal recommendations feel reliable again, precisely because they’re not part of the public review circus.

Second, savvy consumers cross-check everything. Rather than trusting one site’s reviews, they compare across multiple sources, the product might be 4.8 on the official store, but what’s it rated elsewhere?

Is there a discrepancy between the slick website testimonials and the chatter on Reddit? More often than not, shoppers now triangulate information. In fact, three out of four people use two or more sites when reading reviews, rather than putting all their faith in one platform’s word. We instinctively seek a consensus of truth across the noise.

Finally, many have decided the best judge is themselves. “Try before you buy” has made a comeback as a defense against dubious reviews. Free trials, freemium tiers, generous return policies, consumers leverage them all to test products firsthand.

If a software platform promises the world in its curated testimonials, a savvy buyer will take the 14-day free trial and see if it lives up to the hype. In sectors like enterprise software, where choices are costly and critical, buyers might run a pilot program or proof-of-concept rather than trust glossy case studies. Essentially, experience has become the new review.

All this has serious implications for platforms and software marketplaces. These businesses built their empires on user-generated trust, turning customer opinion into a key part of the shopping experience.

If that trust evaporates, the model cracks. We’re already seeing the early signs: users skipping the review tab, or treating every five-star rating with a healthy dose of skepticism.

If the review economy continues on its current path, platforms risk becoming mere transaction processors rather than trust brokers.

For the marketplaces, this is both a crisis and an opportunity. The crisis is obvious: loss of credibility. If people no longer believe what they read on your platform, they’ll seek validation elsewhere, and your influence over purchase decisions diminishes.

But the opportunity lies in reform. Platforms could double down on authenticity as a feature, verifying purchases, cracking down harder on fraudulent and incentivized reviews, and highlighting more qualitative, nuanced feedback instead of simple star counts.

There’s even a chance to innovate with new trust signals (some are experimenting with things like verified buyer badges, AI analysis for suspicious patterns, or weighted ratings that account for reviewer reputation). The platforms that find ways to genuinely restore faith in their review systems will win back weary consumers. Those that don’t will see their communities drift away, bit by bit.

Importantly, not all platforms have given in to the dark side. A handful still refuse pay-for-play tactics, no paid reviews, no under-the-table boosting of rankings for advertisers.

These holdouts demonstrate that integrity in reviews is possible, even if it means slower growth in the short term.

In the end, the broken review economy is forcing a rebalance of how we decide what to trust. Buyers are adapting, finding new ways to cut through the noise. And the platforms that once thrived on being the ultimate source of truth in purchasing may have to rethink their approach if they want to stay relevant.

Trust, once lost, is hard to regain. The five-star system doesn’t shine as bright as it used to; perhaps it’s time for the next evolution in how we share and earn trust online.

            <div id="article-text">2025 was the year technology stopped being tomorrow’s promise and became today’s anchor. What began as a surge in generative AI and platform innovation two years prior crystallized this year into concrete shifts in how people work, governing bodies legislate, and markets invest. Across continents and industries, the arc of technology bent toward practical impact, regulatory reality, and economic weight!

At the heart of the year’s story was artificial intelligence’s jump from novelty to infrastructure. LLMs and multimodal models moved beyond demos into everyday workflows, influencing how documents are written, campaigns are conceived, products designed, and code generated.

Enterprises that once hesitated began deploying AI tools at scale, with early adopters reporting measurable productivity gains by integrating copilots into core processes, a trend visible in surveys showing widespread adoption among software professionals.

This editorial isn’t a chronicle of every press release.

It’s a reflection on how 2025, at the crossroads of technology, governance, and economic strategy, brought about a series of inflection points that will shape the next era of creation, competition, and control.

TNW City Coworking space - Where your best work happens

A workspace designed for growth, collaboration, and endless networking opportunities in the heart of tech.

OpenAI’s release of GPT-5 in August pushed the boundaries of what AI could do, delivering notable gains in coding, math, and multimodal understanding. But unlike the jaw-dropping debut of ChatGPT a couple years prior, this new generation of foundation models arrived to a more measured reception.

Tech leaders and investors had begun asking harder questions: beyond impressive demos, could these models drive real products and revenue?

Google’s answer was Gemini 3, launched in November as its “most intelligent model” and immediately woven into Google’s flagship product, Search. For the first time, an AI model upgrade wasn’t just about boastful leaderboard scores, it was about transforming user experience.

Typing a query into Google now often meant receiving an AI-generated synthesis instead of the familiar list of links, a sea change in how information is delivered. Google even unveiled a Gemini “agent” that could execute multi-step tasks like booking travel or organizing email, hinting at a future where AI acts more like a digital butler than a chatbox.

Anthropic’s Claude 4 model, for instance, gained a strong following among developers by expanding how much it could handle at once, processing entire codebases with tens of thousands of lines, rather than by producing viral one-liners.

AI grew up in 2025: it was still improving at breakneck speed, but it also had to earn its keep in real products and justify the billion-dollar bets fueling its rise.

Driving this AI explosion was a parallel leap in hardware. The hunger for AI computers in 2025 was insatiable, and chipmakers raced to deliver.

NVIDIA, whose GPUs had become the era’s essential infrastructure, rolled out its new Blackwell architecture with chips like the B200 that boasted up to 3× the training speed of its predecessor. Cloud data centers around the world scrambled to deploy these to keep up with demand from model training and inference.

Rival chipmakers weren’t idle either: AMD and a cadre of startups pushed innovative AI accelerators, while even Intel signaled ambitions to catch up, reportedly exploring an acquisition of AI chip designer SambaNova.

Perhaps most tellingly, tech giants themselves started designing silicon tailored for AI workloads, recognizing that owning the chip means owning the future of computing.

Beyond AI chips, consumer hardware saw its own milestones. After years of anticipation, augmented reality glasses and mixed-reality headsets finally had their moment, sort of.

Apple’s Vision Pro headset, unveiled in late 2023, reached select markets in 2024; by 2025 developers were crafting the first wave of immersive apps. However, mass adoption lagged due to the device’s sky-high price and bulky format.

Competitors like Meta’s Quest line offered cheaper VR headsets and modest improvements, but the “metaverse” hype of yesteryear largely fizzled out, users and investors had shifted their excitement to generative AI and tangible productivity tools.

Smartphones and laptops in 2025 continued incremental improvements (faster Apple M3/M4 chips, foldable screens becoming more common), yet it was clear the next paradigm shift in personal tech was still on the horizon.

Even so, one hardware frontier made concrete progress: quantum computing. Industry leaders like IBM and Google demonstrated prototype systems with ever-larger qubit counts and made strides in error correction, inching closer to viable quantum machines.

These advances, while esoteric to the public, underscored a broader theme, from AI accelerators to quantum chips, the machinery under the hood of tech was evolving rapidly to enable the software of tomorrow.

If 2025 proved anything, it’s that technology no longer operates above the law. This was the year regulators moved from intent to enforcement, with Europe leading the charge.

After years of debate, the EU’s Artificial Intelligence Act came into force, becoming the world’s first complex AI law. From February, certain “unacceptable risk” uses, such as social scoring and real-time biometric surveillance, were banned outright.

By August, transparency rules followed, forcing companies to label AI-generated content and comply with new obligations for general-purpose models. The signal was unmistakable: in Europe, the era of unchecked AI was over.

Companies now face audits, penalties, and real consequences if their systems cross legal or ethical lines, a regulatory moment European officials openly compared to GDPR’s impact on data privacy.

The pressure didn’t stop with AI. In 2025, regulators also went after the gatekeepers. The EU’s Digital Markets Act forced long-resistant changes from Big Tech, most notably when Apple opened the iPhone to third-party app stores and sideloading in Europe, dismantling a 15-year walled garden.

At the same time, enforcement of the Digital Services Act intensified. Platforms were scrutinized for how they handle disinformation, with companies like X warned or penalized during periods of geopolitical tension. In response, social networks expanded moderation teams, adjusted algorithms, and exposed more of their inner workings to researchers.

The US issued an AI executive order and signaled tougher enforcement through agencies like the FTC, while states stepped in, including New York’s law requiring mental-health warnings on addictive social features.

In China, new draft rules targeted AI systems designed for human-like interaction, tightening licensing and ideological oversight. By the end of the year, the freewheeling phase of tech disruption had given way to something more restrained. The question was no longer whether regulation would catch up, but how deeply it would reshape innovation itself.

The platform shake-up that began in 2023 gathered real momentum in 2025, as both companies and users adjusted to a post-pandemic, AI-saturated reality.

Nowhere was this clearer than in social media. Elon Musk’s X, which entered the decade with noise and bravado, found itself on the defensive. Meta’s Threads, initially dismissed after an early spike, steadily closed the gap, nearing parity with X in daily mobile users by mid-year.

X’s audience shrank as policy whiplash and leadership churn eroded confidence, and while its remaining users were still deeply engaged, the era of unquestioned Twitter dominance was over. Disenchanted users scattered across a fragmented landscape, from Meta’s polished Threads to decentralized alternatives like Bluesky and Mastodon, breaking the old Facebook–Instagram–Twitter equilibrium.

The recalibration extended well beyond social feeds.

Major platforms retooled around changing habits: Google reshaped Search around generative answers to fend off AI assistants and algorithmic discovery, while Microsoft pushed its Copilot deeper into Windows, Office, and Bing, betting on “AI inside” as a platform reset.

Everyday behavior shifted too. Smarter voice and chat assistants returned to daily use, handling emails, refunds, and scheduling with little friction. At the same time, screen fatigue set in. Digital-detox travel gained traction, and younger users gravitated toward apps that promised less algorithmic pressure and more human curation. Even streaming came full circle.

After years of fragmentation, providers began rebundling services, offering combined video, music, and gaming packages that looked suspiciously like cable TV reborn, a reminder that while technology moves forward, user preferences often move in cycles.

Amid the gains and momentum, 2025 also became a year of reckoning. As AI systems spread, society began grappling with their cultural and ethical cost. Creators who once marveled at generative tools started pushing back, arguing that their work had been absorbed without consent or compensation.

A wave of lawsuits moved through US courts, with authors accusing companies like OpenAI, Meta, and Google of scraping books and articles to train models. By year’s end, the message was unmistakable: if AI is built on human creativity, many believe its rewards can no longer flow in one direction alone.

Public trust in technology was also tested by a rise in malicious uses and misuses. In the financial domain, sophisticated deepfake scams caused real damage. The frequency of such incidents spiked sharply; cybersecurity firms reported a 3000% increase in deepfake-related fraud over two years, and authorities scrambled to educate businesses on new verification practices.

Misinformation continued to be a menace: during elections and conflicts, AI-generated fake images and videos spread on social media, forcing newsrooms to set up rapid-response fact-checking teams.

Encouragingly, 2025 also saw growth in countermeasures, from better deepfake detection algorithms to nascent standards for cryptographic content authentication (the Coalition for Content Provenance, including major publishers and tech platforms, expanded efforts to watermark authentic media).

Still, the information ecosystem remained fraught, as even savvy citizens found it ever harder to tell the truth from fabrication online.

And then there’s the human element: how all this tech is affecting everyday lives and livelihoods. Workplace AI adoption soared this year; tools like Microsoft 365 Copilot and a host of AI assistants became common on office desktops. Studies showed productivity boosts but also raised concerns about workers becoming overly reliant on AI suggestions.

Meanwhile, fears of automation resurfaced in certain sectors, for example, as chatbots took over more customer service and code-generation tools improved, professionals in call centers and junior programming positions wondered about long-term job security.

These anxieties fueled calls for new approaches to education and training, so that the workforce of 2030 will be prepared for more creative, complex tasks that AI can’t easily handle.

Lovable (Stockholm, Sweden) came as one of the most remarkable AI software stories of the year, for me. What began as an open-source project evolved into a commercial platform that lets users build fully functional websites and apps using plain-language prompts, no traditional coding required.

This approach, known in the industry as “vibe coding,” turns ideas into production-ready software simply by describing what you want in natural language.

Lovable’s growth in 2025 was extraordinary by any measure. Eight months after its launch, the company hit over $100 million in annual recurring revenue and raised a $200 million Series A at a roughly $1.8 billion valuation, making it one of Europe’s fastest-growing software startups ever.

By year’s end, Lovable had secured $330 million in Series B funding at about a $6.6 billion valuation, and was rapidly scaling globally.

What makes Lovable meaningful beyond the numbers is what it represents: a shift in how software is built. It demonstrated that AI can democratize development, giving power to non-technical founders, creators, and teams to go from concept to product without traditional engineering barriers.

In an industry long centered on specialized skills and team structures, Lovable’s rise suggested a future where natural language becomes the primary interface to software creation.

On a more hopeful note, 2025 showed signs of a maturing tech culture. Ethical design moved from talking point to practice. Major platforms began experimenting with limits, turning off infinite scroll for teens, adding prompts that nudged users to pause, and treating “time well spent” as a real metric rather than a slogan.

In AI, transparency gained ground. Under pressure from regulators and researchers, companies like OpenAI and Google disclosed more about how their models are trained and where they fall short.

Researchers formed new alliances to share safety techniques, and a second global AI Safety Summit brought dozens of countries together around questions of alignment and control.

None of it amounted to binding rules, but it marked a shift in tone: even the architects of powerful systems openly acknowledged the need for restraint.

Taken together, these moments made 2025 a turning point. For years, technology had surged ahead of the institutions meant to guide it. This year, that gap began to close.

The breakthroughs were real and transformative, but so were the responses to them: laws passed, norms reset, alliances formed. If 2024 was the year the world grasped the power of generative AI, 2025 was the year it began deciding how that power should be used.

The story of technology is no longer just about what can be built, but about how it fits into the lives it shapes, and who gets to decide that fit.

            <div id="article-text">My name is Alexandru Stan, and this article continues the dialogue I began following the acquisition of TNW.

Following the recent transaction, TNW Spaces remains with the Financial Times, while we continue the mission of the website, the events, and the global community.

We already have a dedicated team at tekpon operating the platform, events, and community initiatives. Our objective is to expand and strengthen the team as TNW accelerates its next chapter.

TNW is already a global media platform with millions of readers. We’re not starting over. We are building forward.

TNW City Coworking space - Where your best work happens

A workspace designed for growth, collaboration, and endless networking opportunities in the heart of tech.

Technology is entering a decisive stage: AI is reshaping workflows, distribution is shifting, capital is becoming more selective, and founders are expected to demonstrate value rather than potential.

The world doesn’t need more noise.
It needs clarity, execution, and access to trustworthy knowledge and people.

TNW will serve that need through editorial independence, real expertise, and community-built intelligence.

Success for TNW looks like this: more accurate understanding, faster access to verified knowledge, and direct pathways from insight to action.

I’ve been an entrepreneur since 2007, building in B2B SaaS, marketplaces, and scalable systems. I believe deeply in servant leadership. Without people, I am zero.

I lead two private networks grounded in practice rather than theory:

These groups ensure TNW remains rooted in lived experience, informed by operators, not commentators.

Our mission is to build the most trusted European tech media platform with global reach, focused on practical innovation, responsible scaling, and transparency.

We will continue to host events across Europe’s major capitals including Paris, London, Berlin, Amsterdam, and Monaco.

These will not be festivals. We are introducing a concept validated through tekpon events: curated gatherings built for meaningful relationships, deep content, and tangible business outcomes.

In 2026, we return to Amsterdam for a special edition centered on AI among other fields. We will explore technologies and strategies shaping the future of work and business:

The editorial focus remains European, while the audience is global.

AI is not a threat to publishing. It is the infrastructure of the next generation of content and knowledge.

At TNW, we will use AI to accelerate research, enable personalized intelligence, reduce noise and bias, and amplify high-quality human expertise. Technology assists. Human judgment remains central.

Because this moment in Europe matters.
Because founders here are ready to scale responsibly.
Because independent media with integrity is rare.
Because innovation deserves a platform built around people, not hype.

TNW will continue its legacy with a renewed emphasis on contribution, execution, and community built through trust.

If you are building, scaling, or researching the next wave of technology, I invite you to engage with us, contribute insights, and participate in shaping the conversation.

The next era begins now. Let’s shape it together.

            <div id="article-text">Most engineering leaders cannot answer the one question their CFO is about to ask: “Can you prove this AI spend is changing outcomes, not just activity?”

Every December, roadmaps get locked, budgets get approved, and board decks are polished until everything looks precise and under control. Underneath, many CTOs and VPs are still working with partial visibility. They have a feel for their teams, but not a reliable view of how work moves through the system, how AI is really changing delivery, or where time and money actually go.

For a while, that was survivable. Experience, pattern recognition, and cheap capital covered the gaps. You could hire around bottlenecks, overstaff critical teams, or quietly pivot away from the messiest parts of the system. Then AI showed up and became the perfect distraction. Pilots, PoCs, Copilot seats, and “AI initiatives” created visible activity and bought time.

In 2026, that grace period ends. Boards and CFOs are shifting from “show me you are experimenting” to “show me measurable impact, this year.” Not because they stopped believing in AI, but because the market no longer rewards vague promises. Every AI dollar will need a traceable path to productivity, quality, or customer value.

If you run engineering, you probably recognise this scene. You present a slide with AI highlights. Adoption is up. Developers say they like the tools. You share a few anecdotes about faster coding and smoother reviews. Then the CFO asks a simple question: “Exactly how is this budget changing output and outcomes?”

TNW City Coworking space - Where your best work happens

A workspace designed for growth, collaboration, and endless networking opportunities in the heart of tech.

What is almost always missing is a clear breakdown of:

So the conversation slips back to learning curves, compounding benefits, and talent attraction. All true, but too soft for a tough budget review. That will not be enough.

AI vendors love task-level numbers. A coding task completed 55 percent faster looks impressive on a slide. But once you zoom out to teams and systems, the picture changes.

Large datasets across thousands of developers show a consistent pattern:

The problem is not the tools. It is the lack of a system for where the “extra” capacity goes.

Most organisations still frame AI productivity in terms of speed: more story points, more tickets, higher deployment frequency. That misses the bigger question:

How much of our engineering capacity goes to net new value versus maintenance, incidents, and rework, and is AI improving that mix?

High-level benchmarks are blunt but helpful. On average, about 45 percent of developer time is spent on maintenance, minor enhancements, and bug fixes rather than on genuinely new, customer-facing work. If AI helps you produce more code inside an unchanged system, you risk:

That is how you end up with impressive local metrics and a leadership team that still feels like engineering is slowing down.

If you want to walk into a 2026 budget conversation with objective evidence, you need to be deliberate about how AI-driven time savings are used. Two moves matter.

AI is already good at boilerplate, tests, documentation, and simple refactors. The trap is treating the saved time as unstructured “extra” capacity that disappears into the noise. Instead:

When teams systematically reduce technical debt and improve tests around critical flows, they cut future incidents and rework. Over a year, that frees more capacity for new work than shaving a few minutes off each ticket ever will.

2. Point AI at the ugly, high-friction work that commonly blows up roadmaps

The biggest productivity wins are not in everyday code generation. They are in:

These activities steal weeks or months of capacity and stall strategic initiatives. Using AI to understand legacy code faster, propose refactoring plans, generate migration scaffolding, and highlight recurring failure patterns can dramatically compress timelines for this work.

In parallel, there is real leverage upstream in the problem space. Teams that reach higher levels of AI adoption report better gains when they:

That reduces wasted builds and focuses effort on changes customers actually care about. The most significant gains do not come from replacing human creativity, but from amplifying it and aiming it at better-defined problems.

DORA metrics are not the enemy. Deployment frequency, lead time, MTTR, and change failure rate remain among the best signals we have for delivery performance. The risk is mistaking them for the whole picture.

Leading organisations are already expanding their scorecard to include:

In 2026, the question in the boardroom will shift from “Are we elite on DORA?” to “How much of our capacity is going into things customers notice, and is AI improving that mix or not?” To answer that cleanly, DORA is necessary but not sufficient. You need a way to connect AI usage, workflow, quality, and business outcomes across the system.

This is where engineering intelligence platforms move from a nice-to-have to mandatory. The organisations that win in 2026 will not do it with one more AI tool or one more disconnected dashboard. They will do it by pulling together data they already have but rarely use in one coherent view:

From there, leaders can answer the questions that actually matter:

Instead of defending AI spend with anecdotes, you walk in with:

That is the difference between “we believe in AI” and “here is how AI changed our delivery engine in measurable ways.”

To be ready for the more complex questions coming next year, use this planning cycle to do four things.

Do this, and you will not just have “AI activity” to show in 2026. You will have a credible, data-backed story from AI spend to business outcomes.

The leaders who thrive next year will not be the ones with the flashiest AI demos or the loudest “AI strategy” slide. They will be the ones who:

Engineering intelligence platforms is a key part of that shift. They give you the complex data to show where time and money go, how AI is really changing delivery, and whether your current pace is sustainable. The shift to data-backed engineering leadership is happening either way.

The gap in 2026 will be between teams still guessing and teams that can prove, in detail, how their engineering organisation works.
