            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2026/01/starlink-demands-grant-money-from-states-even-when-residents-dont-buy-service/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">SpaceX has made a new set of demands on state governments that would ensure Starlink receives federal grant money even when residents don’t purchase Starlink broadband service.

SpaceX said it will provide “all necessary equipment” to receive broadband “at no cost to subscribers requesting service,” which will apparently eliminate the up-front hardware fee for Starlink equipment. But SpaceX isn’t promising lower-than-usual monthly prices to consumers in those subsidized areas. SpaceX pledged to make broadband available for $80 or less a month, plus taxes and fees, to people with low incomes in the subsidized areas. For comparison, the normal Starlink residential prices advertised on its website range from $50 to $120 a month.

SpaceX’s demands would also guarantee that it gets paid by the government even if it doesn’t reserve “large portions” of Starlink network capacity for homes in the areas that are supposed to receive government-subsidized Internet service. Moreover, SpaceX would not be responsible for ensuring that Starlink equipment is installed correctly at each customer location.

SpaceX sent a letter to state broadband offices proposing a rider with terms that it hopes will be applied to all grants it receives throughout the country. The letter was obtained and published by Broadband.io and the Benton Institute for Broadband & Society.

Arguing that SpaceX should receive grant money regardless of whether residents purchase Starlink service, the letter to states said that grant payments should not depend on “the independent purchasing decisions of users.” SpaceX also said it will not hold “large portions of capacity fallow” to ensure that people in subsidized areas receive good service, but will instead continue its preexisting practice of “dynamically allocat[ing] capacity where needed.”

SpaceX’s proposed contract rider would apply to grants distributed under the US government’s Broadband Equity, Access, and Deployment (BEAD) program. BEAD was created by Congress in a 2021 law that authorized spending over $42 billion to make broadband networks available in areas without modern service.

While the Biden administration designed the program to prioritize fiber deployments, the Trump administration threw out the previous plans. Under Trump, the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) deemed the Biden-era plan too costly and changed the rules to make it easier for satellite services to obtain grant funding. The overhaul cut projected spending to about $21 billion, and it’s still not clear what will happen to the other $21 billion.

Starlink sought billions in grants after the new rules were put in place, but states didn’t want to provide that much. So far, SpaceX is slated to receive $733.5 million to offer broadband at 472,600 locations. Amazon’s Leo satellite service (formerly Kuiper) is set to receive $311 million for 415,000 locations.

While not every state plan is final, it looks like satellite networks will get about 5 percent of the grant money and serve over 22 percent of locations funded by grants. Satellite companies are getting smaller payments on a per-location basis because, unlike fiber providers, they don’t have to install infrastructure at each customer’s location.

The concessions sought by SpaceX “would limit Starlink’s performance obligations, payment schedules, non-compliance penalties, reporting expectations, and labor and insurance standards,” wrote Drew Garner, director of policy engagement at the Benton Institute. Garner argued that SpaceX’s demands illustrate problems in how the Trump NTIA rewrote program rules to increase reliance on low-Earth orbit (LEO) satellite providers.

“BEAD was designed primarily to deploy terrestrial networks, which are physically located in communities, built with traditional construction methods, and are relatively easy to monitor and inspect,” Garner wrote. “But, on June 6, 2025, NTIA restructured BEAD in ways that greatly increased participation by LEO providers, exacerbating the challenge of applying BEAD’s terrestrial-focused rules to LEO’s extraterrestrial networks.”

Among other things, SpaceX is trying to “minimize states’ ability to penalize LEO grantees for defaulting or failing to comply with contract requirements,” and avoid having “to report on the use of BEAD funds or other financial information related to the grant,” Garner wrote.

SpaceX’s letter said that “all requirements related to labor issues (e.g., prevailing wage and similar obligations), contractors, and procurement are inapplicable to SpaceX” because “there are no identifiable employees, contractors, or contracts being funded” to support Starlink broadband service in each state. Similarly, “there are no identifiable pieces of SpaceX infrastructure equipment (other than satellite capacity delivered from Space) being funded via BEAD,” the company said.

It’s not clear whether SpaceX will turn down grants if it doesn’t get what it wants. We asked the company for information on its plans if states refuse its terms and will update this article if we get a response. SpaceX’s proposed terms could also be applied to Amazon if states accept them.

SpaceX’s letter said that despite the Trump administration’s changes to BEAD, “a number of issues remain that, if unaddressed, could render LEO participation in the program untenable.” SpaceX said it wants to work with states “to more fully tailor aspects of the project agreement to the reality of LEO deployment and operations now that the initial project selection and approval phase is accomplished.”

Space said it wants to avoid extensive negotiations over its proposed terms. But the acknowledgement that some negotiation may be necessary seems to recognize that states don’t have to comply with the demands:

Toward this goal, we have developed a set of terms that we intend to function as a rider to all subgrant agreements across the country. This rider is intentionally limited in scope to addressing items of critical importance, to minimize the need for negotiation, and provide clarity to both parties moving forward. Our intention is for the LEO rider to enable the state to keep its core subgrant agreement relatively uniform amongst grantees, retain state-law-specific requirements, co-locate all relevant LEO-specific material for ease of administration, and standardize agreements across states.

SpaceX’s proposed contract rider said the firm will offer broadband plans for “a monthly cost of $80 or less before applicable taxes and fees” to households that meet the low-income eligibility guidelines used by the FCC’s Lifeline program. People who don’t qualify for low-income plans would presumably pay regular Starlink rates.

The BEAD law requires ISPs receiving federal funds to offer at least one “low-cost broadband service option for eligible subscribers.” While the Biden administration sought low-income plans that cost as little as $30 a month, the Trump administration decided that states may not tell ISPs what prices to charge in their low-cost options. A Trump administration threat to shut states out of BEAD if they required low prices doomed a California proposal to mandate $15 monthly plans for people with low incomes.

SpaceX told state governments that it should receive 50 percent of grant funds when it certifies that it is capable of providing BEAD-quality service (100Mbps download and 20Mbps upload speeds) within 10 business days to any potential customer that requests it in a grant area. The rest of the money would be distributed quarterly over the 10-year period of the grant.

Explaining why SpaceX shouldn’t be penalized if potential customers decide Starlink prices are too high, the firm wrote:

Tying payments to the independent purchasing decisions of users solely for awardees using LEO technologies, and not for any other technology, is, by definition, not technology neutral. SpaceX is already appropriately incentivized to gather customers by the opportunity to capture the monthly recurring revenue from each subscriber. SpaceX was in most instances awarded the most remote and difficult areas to serve among all other providers. SpaceX is up to the task of ensuring success in these challenging areas, however, it cannot undertake this mission without certainty of consistent payments to compensate such work.

Based on SpaceX’s letter, it sounds like the work the company must do to ensure quality of service at BEAD-funded locations is the same work it has already done to make Starlink available across the US. Instead of dedicated capacity for government-subsidized deployments, SpaceX said it will simply factor the needs of BEAD users into its planning:

With respect to capacity reservations, we have found some confusion regarding how such a reservation is made. Given the dynamic nature of the Starlink network, the reservation will not be such that SpaceX holds large portions of capacity fallow. This would be wasteful, inefficient, and does not reflect a LEO providers [sic] ability to dynamically allocate capacity where needed. Instead, SpaceX will include the capacity needs of BEAD users into its network planning efforts. These activities are multifaceted and include real time capacity allocation at the network level, launch activities, and sales efforts. As a result, there is no single “document” evidencing the reservation of capacity.

SpaceX said it will be obvious if it does not provide sufficient service, and thus the states should not seek additional performance testing beyond what’s included in the NTIA guidelines. “If sufficient capacity was not reserved, performance testing will reveal insufficient quality of service, and this deficiency will be transparent to the state. Developing a separate, indirect measurement of the reservation itself is infeasible and unnecessary,” SpaceX said.

The proposed rider said that any network testing must “exclude subscribers who have installed CPE [consumer premise equipment] such that its view of the sky is obstructed and subscribers with damaged or malfunctioning CPE, as determined by GRANTEE.”

The “as determined by GRANTEE” phrase means it’s up to SpaceX to decide which subscribers should be excluded from testing. As the Benton Society says, the rider stipulates that “performance tests can only be considered if the LEO provider determines that the subscriber’s equipment is properly installed, and, notably, the LEO provider is not obligated to ensure proper installation.”

SpaceX’s proposed rider defines a “standard installation” as the mailing of equipment to a subscriber. That’s the standard process for un-subsidized areas throughout the country, and SpaceX doesn’t want to do any extra work to help set up equipment for customers in subsidized areas. However, customers may be able to purchase professional installation for an extra fee.

“For the avoidance of doubt, the GRANTEE will not be responsible for completing a permanent installation” at each location, SpaceX’s proposed rider says. A satellite provider “may choose to offer the subscriber professional services for permanent installation of CPE at an additional fee, but such professional services shall not be considered part of the standard installation,” it says.</div>

            <h2>Angry Norfolk residents lose lawsuit to stop Flock license plate scanners</h2>
            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-01-28</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2026/01/angry-norfolk-residents-lose-lawsuit-to-stop-flock-license-plate-scanners/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">A federal judge in Virginia ruled Tuesday that the City of Norfolk’s use of nearly 200 automated license plate readers (ALPRs) from Flock is constitutional and can continue, dismissing the entire case just days before a bench trial was set to begin.

The case, Schmidt v. City of Norfolk, was originally filed in October 2024 by two Virginians who claimed that their rights were violated when the Flock network of cameras captured their cars hundreds of times, calling the entire setup a “dragnet surveillance program.”

However, in a 51-page ruling, US District Court Judge Mark S. Davis disagreed, finding that the “…plaintiffs are unable to demonstrate that Defendants’ ALPR system is capable of tracking the whole of a person’s movements.”

Judge Davis acknowledged that while there may come a time when the use of ALPRs becomes too intrusive, “what is readily apparent to this Court is that, at least in Norfolk, Virginia, the answer is: not today.”

The Virginia plaintiffs were represented by attorneys from the Institute of Justice, a libertarian nonprofit public interest law firm that vowed to appeal the ruling.

Over the past decade, Flock Safety has grown to become the most sophisticated and largest ALPR vendor in America. The City of Norfolk—along with thousands of other law enforcement agencies across the country—contracts with the Atlanta-based startup, most recently valued at $7.5 billion, for ALPR services.

Flock cameras capture not just a simple license plate number—as the tech once did a decade ago—but now can easily capture make, model, and other visual details from each car; these can be searched using AI-powered natural language queries that can include phrases like “bike rack” or “tow truck.”

Recently, some jurisdictions, from Santa Cruz, California, to Charlottesville, Virginia, have ended their contracts with Flock over concerns that the technology is too invasive and may provide information to federal immigration authorities over the objections of local policymakers. Last year, two senators expressed grave privacy concerns and wrote in a letter to the company that “abuse of Flock cameras is inevitable.”

In his Thursday ruling, Judge Davis referenced the family tree of modern surveillance case-law, noting that a 1983 Supreme Court case (Knotts v. United States) found that there is no “reasonable expectation of privacy” when traveling on a public road.

That 1983 case, which centered on a radio transmitter that enabled law enforcement to follow the movements of alleged drug traffickers driving between Minnesota and Wisconsin, has provided the legal underpinning for the use of ALPR technology in the United States over the last few decades.

“Modern-day license plate reader systems, like Norfolk’s, are nothing like [the technology of the early 1980s],” Michael Soyfer, one of the Institute of Justice attorneys, told Ars by email. “They track the movements of virtually every driver within a city for weeks at a time. That can reveal a host of insights not captured in any single trip.”

For its part, Flock Safety celebrated the ruling and wrote on its website that its clients may continue to use the cameras.

“Here, the court emphasized that LPR technology, as deployed in Norfolk, is meaningfully different from systems that enable persistent, comprehensive tracking of individuals’ movements,” the company wrote.

“When used with appropriate limitations and safeguards, LPRs do not provide an intimate portrait of a person’s life and therefore do not trigger the constitutional concerns raised by continuous surveillance,” it added.

But some legal scholars disagree with both the judge’s and Flock’s conclusions.

Andrew Ferguson, a law professor at George Washington University and the author of the forthcoming book Your Data Will Be Used Against You: Policing in the Age of Self-Surveillance, told Ars by email that the judge’s ruling here is “understandably conservative and dangerous.”

“The danger is that the same reasoning that there is no expectation of privacy in public would justify having ALPR cameras on every single street corner,” he continued.

“Further,” he said, “looking at the technology as a mere tool, rather than a system of surveillance, misses the mark on its erosion of privacy. Think how revealing ALPRs would be outside religious institutions, gun ranges, medical clinics, addiction treatment centers, or protests.”</div>

            <h2>US cyber defense chief accidentally uploaded secret government info to ChatGPT</h2>
            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-01-28</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2026/01/us-cyber-defense-chief-accidentally-uploaded-secret-government-info-to-chatgpt/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Alarming critics, the acting director of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), Madhu Gottumukkala, accidentally uploaded sensitive information to a public version of ChatGPT last summer, Politico reported.

According to “four Department of Homeland Security officials with knowledge of the incident,” Gottumukkala’s uploads of sensitive CISA contracting documents triggered multiple internal cybersecurity warnings designed to “stop the theft or unintentional disclosure of government material from federal networks.”

Gottumukkala’s uploads happened soon after he joined the agency and sought special permission to use OpenAI’s popular chatbot, which most DHS staffers are blocked from accessing, DHS confirmed to Ars. Instead, DHS staffers use approved AI-powered tools, like the agency’s DHSChat, which “are configured to prevent queries or documents input into them from leaving federal networks,” Politico reported.

It remains unclear why Gottumukkala needed to use ChatGPT. One official told Politico that, to staffers, it seemed like Gottumukkala “forced CISA’s hand into making them give him ChatGPT, and then he abused it.”

The information Gottumukkala reportedly leaked was not confidential but marked “for official use only.” That designation, a DHS document explained, is “used within DHS to identify unclassified information of a sensitive nature” that, if shared without authorization, “could adversely impact a person’s privacy or welfare” or impede how federal and other programs “essential to the national interest” operate.

There’s now a concern that the sensitive information could be used to answer prompts from any of ChatGPT’s 700 million active users.

OpenAI did not respond to Ars’ request to comment, but Cyber News reported that experts have warned “that using public AI tools poses real risks because uploaded data can be retained, breached, or used to inform responses to other users.”

Sources told Politico that DHS investigated the incident for potentially harming government security—which could result in administrative or disciplinary actions, DHS officials told Politico. Possible consequences could range from a formal warning or mandatory retraining to “suspension or revocation of a security clearance,” officials said.

However, CISA’s director of public affairs, Marci McCarthy, declined Ars’ request to confirm if that probe, launched in August, has concluded or remains ongoing. Instead, she seemed to emphasize that Gottumukkala’s access to ChatGPT was only temporary, while suggesting that the ChatGPT use aligned with Donald Trump’s order to deploy AI across government.

“Acting Director Dr. Madhu Gottumukkala was granted permission to use ChatGPT with DHS controls in place,” McCarthy said. “This use was short-term and limited. CISA is unwavering in its commitment to harnessing AI and other cutting-edge technologies to drive government modernization and deliver” on Trump’s order.

Gottumukkala has not had a smooth run as acting director of the top US cyber defense agency after Trump’s pick to helm the agency, Sean Plankey, was blocked by Sen. Rick Scott (R-Fla.) “over a Coast Guard shipbuilding contract,” Politico noted.

DHS Secretary Kristi Noem chose Gottumukkala to fill in after he previously served as her chief information officer, overseeing statewide cybersecurity initiatives in South Dakota. CISA celebrated his appointment with a press release boasting that he had more than 24 years of experience in information technology and a “deep understanding of both the complexities and practical realities of infrastructure security.”

However, critics “on both sides of the aisle” have questioned whether Gottumukkala knows what he’s doing at CISA, Cyberscoop reported. That includes staffers who stayed on and staffers who prematurely left the agency due to uncertainty over its future, Politico reported.

At least 65 staffers have been curiously reassigned to other parts of DHS, Cyberscoop reported, inciting Democrats’ fears that CISA staffers are possibly being pushed over to Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).

The same fate almost befell Robert Costello, CISA’s chief information officer, who was reportedly involved with meetings last August probing Gottumukkala’s improper ChatGPT use and “the proper handling of for official use only material,” Politico reported.

Earlier this month, staffers alleged that Gottumukkala took steps to remove Costello from his CIO position, which he has held for the past four years. But that plan was blocked after “other political appointees at the department objected,” Politico reported. Until others intervened to permanently thwart the reassignment, Costello was supposedly given “roughly one week” to decide if he would take another position within DHS or resign, sources told Politico.

Gottumukkala has denied that he sought to reassign Costello over a personal spat that Politico’s sources said sprang from “friction because Costello frequently pushed back against Gottumukkala on policy matters.” He insisted that “senior personnel decisions are made at the highest levels at the Department of Homeland Security’s Headquarters and are not made in a vacuum, independently by one individual, or on a whim.”

The reported move looked particularly shady, though, because Costello “is seen as one of the agency’s top remaining technical talents,” Politico reported.

This month, Congress grilled Gottumukkala about mass layoffs last year that shrank CISA from about 3,400 staffers to 2,400. The steep cuts seemed to threaten national security and election integrity, lawmakers warned, and potentially have left the agency unprepared for any potential conflicts with China.

At a hearing held by the House Homeland Security Committee, Gottumukkala said that CISA was “getting back on mission” and plans to reverse much of the damage done last year to the agency.

However, some of his responses did not inspire confidence, including a failure to forecast “how many cyber intrusions CISA expects from foreign adversaries as part of the 2026 midterm elections,” the Federal News Network reported. In particular, Rep. Tony Gonzales (R-Texas) criticized Gottumukkala for not having “a specific number in mind.”

“Well, we should have that number,” Gonzales said. “It should first start by how many intrusions that we had last midterm and the midterm before that. I don’t want to wait. I don’t want us waiting until after the fact to be able to go, ‘Yeah, we got it wrong, and it turns out our adversaries influenced our election to that point.’”

Perhaps notably, Gottumukkala also dodged questions about reports that he failed a polygraph when attempting to seek access to other “highly sensitive cyber intelligence,” Politico reported.

The acting director apparently blamed six career CISA staffers for requesting that he agree to the polygraph test, which the staffers said was typical protocol but Gottumukkala later claimed was misleading.

Failing the test isn’t necessarily damning, since anxiety or technical errors could trigger a negative result. However, Gottumukkala appears touchy about the test that he now regrets sitting for, calling the test “unsanctioned” and refusing to discuss the results.

It seems that Gottumukkala felt misled after learning that he could have requested a waiver to skip the polygraph. In a letter suspending those staffers’ security clearances, CISA accused staff of showing “deliberate or negligent failure to follow policies that protect government information.” However, staffers may not have known that he had that option, which is considered a “highly unusual loophole that may not have been readily apparent to career staff,” Politico noted.

Staffers told Politico that Gottumukkala’s tenure has been a “nightmare&quot;—potentially ruining the careers of longtime CISA staffers. It troubles some that it seems that Gottumukkala will remain in his post “for the foreseeable future,” while seeming to politicize the agency and bungle protocols for accessing sensitive information.

According to Nextgov, Gottumukkala plans to right the ship with “a hiring spree in 2026 because its recent reductions have hampered some of the Trump administration’s national security goals.”

In November, the trade publication Cybersecurity Dive reported that Gottumukkala sent a memo confirming the hiring spree was coming that month, while warning that CISA remains “hampered by an approximately 40 percent vacancy rate across key mission areas.” All those cuts were “spurred by the administration’s animus toward CISA over its election security work,” Cybersecurity Dive noted.

“CISA must immediately accelerate recruitment, workforce development, and retention initiatives to ensure mission readiness and operational continuity,” Gottumukkala told staffers at that time, then later went on to reassure Congress this month that the agency has “the required staff” to protect election integrity and national security, Cyberscoop reported.</div>

            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-01-28</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2026/01/why-reviving-the-shuttered-anthem-is-turning-out-tougher-than-expected/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">On January 12, EA shut down the official servers for Anthem, making Bioware’s multiplayer sci-fi adventure completely unplayable for the first time since its troubled 2019 launch. Last week, though, the Anthem community woke up to a new video showing the game at least partially loading on what appears to be a simulated background server.

The people behind that video—and the Anthem revival project that made it possible—told Ars they were optimistic about their efforts to coerce EA’s temperamental Frostbite engine into running the game without access to EA’s servers. That said, the team also wants to temper expectations that may have risen a bit too high in the wake of what is just a proof-of-concept video.

“People are getting excited [about the video], and naturally people are going to get their hopes up,” project administrator Laurie told Ars. “I don’t want to be the person that’s going to have to deal with the aftermath if it turns out that we can’t actually get anywhere.”

The Anthem revival effort currently centers around The Fort’s Forge, a Discord server where a handful of volunteer engineers and developers have gathered to pick apart the game and its unique architecture. Laurie said they initially set up the group “out of little more than spite for EA and Bioware around the time the shutdown got announced” back in July.

While Laurie has some experience with the community behind Gundam Evolution revival project Side 7, they knew they’d need help from people with direct experience working on EA’s Frostbite engine games. Luckily, Laurie said they were “able to catch the eyes of people who are familiar with this line of work [without] searching too much.”

One of those people was Ness199X, an experienced Frostbite tinkerer who told Ars he “never really played much Anthem” before the game’s shutdown was announced. When a friend pointed out the impending death of the title, though, Ness said he was motivated to preserve the game for posterity.

Initial efforts to examine what made Anthem tick “came up empty,” Ness said, largely because the game uses EA’s bespoke Frostbite engine differently than other EA titles. To begin mapping out those differences, Ness released a packet logger tool in September that let contributors record their own network traffic between the client and EA’s official servers. In addition to helping with reverse-engineering work, Ness writes on the Fort’s Forge Discord that players who logged their packets should be able to fully recover their characters if and when Anthem comes back in playable form.

By analyzing that crowdsourced packet data, Ness said the Fort’s Forge team has been able to break Anthem down into three essential services:

Early efforts to emulate the Blaze and BIGS portions of that architecture helped lead directly to last week’s proof-of-concept video. Andersson799—who says he’s been tinkering with Battlefield and other Frostbite games since 2015—said he was quickly able to use his own logged Anthem packets to create a “barebones anthem private server” that served as a “quick and dirty” sample that he decided to share via YouTube.

“I basically made the tool to just simply reply with the packet captures that I got,” Andersson told me. That was enough to “get in to the game with player profiles loaded and everything.” And while Ness says there’s still some effort needed “to [make Blaze and BIGS] work well and smoothly in terms of quest progression, etc.,” the path forward on those portions is relatively straightforward.

It’s the Frostbite engine and its odd client-server architecture that forms the biggest barrier to getting Anthem up and running again without EA’s servers. “Due to how Frostbite is designed, all gameplay in a Frostbite game runs in a ‘server’ context,” Ness explained. Even in a single-player game like Mass Effect: Andromeda, he said, “the client just creates a separate server thread and pipes all the traffic internally.”

“I feel like with Anthem, it heavily relies on online data that was stored in Bioware’s server,” Andersson added. “In my initial testing, the game couldn’t load into the level without that data.”

There’s some hope that this crucial level data is still available and recoverable, though. Ness points out that Fort Tarsis, the game’s lobby area, already runs using offline data piped through a local “server” thread, meaning the rest of the game could theoretically be coerced to run similarly.

Just as important, he says, “as far as we have been able to discern, all the logic for the other levels, which when the game was live ran on a remote server, also exists in the client,” Ness said. “By patching the game we can most likely enable the ability to host these in process as well. That’s what we’re exploring.”

While all that local level data should be usable in theory, seemingly random differences between Anthem and other Frostbite games are getting in the way of loading the data in practice. Anthem acts like a standard Frostbite game “for the most part,” Ness said, but at times will show unusual behaviors that are hard to pin down.

“For example, when we try to load most maps, no NPCs spawn, but in some maps they do,” he said. “And we have yet to determine why. Ness has some suspicion that the odd behavior is connected to the “fairly extensive amount of player data the game keeps as part of its online RPG nature,” but adds that “to be honest we’re not entirely sure how deep the differences go, other than that the engine didn’t behave how we expected it to.”

Ness said he’s about 75 percent confident that the team will be able to figure out how to fully leverage the Frostbite engine to power a version of the game that runs without EA’s centralized servers. If that effort succeeds, he says a playable version of Anthem could be back up and running in “months, or less even, depending on motivation.” But if the efforts to pick apart Anthem’s take on Frostbite hits a brick wall, Ness says “the amount of work increases fairly exponentially and I’m a lot less confident that we have the motivation for that.”

“I’m fairly confident that we can get this game to be playable again, like how it is supposed to be,” Andersson said. “It’ll just take time as most of us have our own life to manage besides this.”

In the meantime, Laurie is still trying to manage expectations set by the somewhat premature posting of Andersson’s proof-of-concept video. “Please, do not expect frequent updates,” Laurie wrote in the Fort’s Forge Discord. “We had not anticipated releasing anything this early, nor should the expedience of this video’s release serve as any kind of benchmark for how fast we make progress.”

Laurie also took to Reddit to publicly call the video “a really hacky thing so I want to ask people to manage their expectations just a bit. A lot of stuff clearly doesn’t work as ‘intended,’ and definitely needs at minimum, more polish.”

At one point last week, Laurie says they had to stop accepting new members to the Fort’s Forge Discord, “mostly to prevent an influx of people in response to… news coverage.” And while people with Frostbite engine modding experience are encouraged to reach out, the small team is being cautious about growing too large, too fast.

“We’re a little reluctant to add developers right now as we have no real code base to work from,” Ness said, describing their current efforts as “scratch work” maintained in separate forms by multiple people. “But once we firm that up (hopefully in the next weeks), we will look to add more [coders].”</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Forty years ago, a stack of bright red tags shared a physical connection with what would become NASA’s first space shuttle disaster. The small tags, however, were collected before the ill-fated launch of Challenger, as was instructed in bold “Remove Before Flight” lettering on the front of each.

What happened to the tags after that is largely unknown.

This is an attempt to learn more about where those “Remove Before Flight” tags went after they were detached from the space shuttle and before they arrived on my doorstep. If their history can be better documented, they can be provided to museums, educational centers, and astronautical archives for their preservation and display.

To begin, we go back 16 years to when they were offered for sale on eBay.

The advertisement on the auction website was titled “Space Shuttle Remove Before Flight Flags Lot of 18.” They were listed with an opening bid of $3.99. On January 12, 2010, I paid $5.50 as the winner.

At that point, my interest in the 3-inch-wide by 12-inch-long (7.6 by 30.5 cm) tags was as handouts for kids and other attendees at future events. Whether it was at an astronaut autograph convention, a space memorabilia show, a classroom visit, or a conference talk, having “swag” was a great way to foster interest in space history. At first glance, these flags seemed to be a perfect fit.

So I didn’t pay much attention when they first arrived. The eBay listing had promoted them only as generic examples of “KSC Form 4-226 (6/77)&quot;—the ID the Kennedy Space Center assigned to the tags. There was no mention of their being used, let alone specifying an orbiter or specific flight. If I recall correctly, the seller said his intention had been to use them on his boat.

(Attempts to retrieve the original listing for this article were unsuccessful. As an eBay spokesperson said, “eBay does not retain transaction records or item details dating back over a decade, and therefore we do not have any information to share with you.”)

It was about a year later when I first noticed the ink stamps at the bottom of each tag. They were marked “ET-26” followed by a number. For example, the first tag in the clipped-together stack was stamped “ET-26-000006.”

“ET” refers to the External Tank. The largest components of the space shuttle stack, the burnt orange or brown tanks were numbered, so 26 had to be one of the earlier missions of the 30-year, 135-flight program.

A fact sheet prepared by Lockheed Martin provided the answer. The company operated at the Michoud Assembly Facility near New Orleans, where the external tanks were built before being barged to the Kennedy Space Center for launch. Part of the sheet listed each launch with its date and numbered external tank. As my finger traced down the page, it came to STS 61-B, 11/26/85, ET-22; STS 61-C, 1/12/86, ET-30; and then STS 51-L, 1/28/86… ET-26.

To be clear, the tags had no role in the loss of Challenger or its crew, including commander Dick Scobee; pilot Mike Smith; mission specialists Ronald McNair, Judith Resnik, and Ellison Onizuka; payload specialist Gregory Jarvis; and Teacher-in-Space Christa McAuliffe. Although the structural failure of the external tank ultimately resulted in Challenger breaking apart, it was a compromised O-ring seal in one of the shuttle’s two solid rocket boosters that allowed hot gas to burn through, impinging the tank.

Further, although it’s still unknown when the tags and their associated ground support equipment (e.g., protective covers, caps) were removed, it was not within hours of the launch, and in many cases, it was completed well before the vehicle reached the pad.

“They were removed later in processing at different times but definitely all done before propellant loading,” said Mike Cianilli, the former manager of NASA’s Apollo, Challenger, Columbia Lessons Learned Program. “To make sure they were gone, final walkdowns and closeouts by the ground crews confirmed removal.”

According to NASA, approximately 20 percent of ET-26 was recovered from the ocean floor after the tragedy, and like the parts of the solid rocket boosters and Challenger, they were placed into storage in two retired missile silos at the Cape Canaveral Air Force Station (today, Space Force Station). Components removed from the vehicle before the ill-fated launch that were no longer needed likely went through the normal surplus processes as overseen by the General Services Administration, said Cianilli.

Once the tags’ association with STS-51L was confirmed, it no longer felt right to use them as giveaways. At least, not to individuals.

There are very few items directly connected to Challenger‘s last flight that museums and other public centers can use to connect their visitors to what transpired 40 years ago. NASA has placed only one piece of Challenger on public display, and that is in the exhibition “Forever Remembered” at the Kennedy Space Center Visitor Complex.

Each of the 50 US states, the Smithsonian, and the president of the United States were also presented with a small American flag and a mission patch that had been aboard Challenger at the time of the tragedy.

Having a more complete history of these tags would help meet the accession requirements of some museums and, if approved, provide curators with the information they need to put the tags on display.

When the tags were first identified, contacts at NASA and Lockheed, among others, were unable to explain how they ended up on eBay and, ultimately, with me.

It was 2011, and the space shuttle program was coming to its end. I was politely told that this was not the time to ask about the tags, as documents were being moved into archives and, perhaps more importantly, people were more concerned about pending layoffs. One person suggested the tags be put back in a drawer and forgotten about for another decade.

In the years since, other “Remove Before Flight” tags from other space shuttle missions have come up for sale. Some have included evidence that the tags had passed through the surplus procedures; some did not and were offered as is.

There were anecdotes about outgoing employees taking home mementos. Maybe someone saw these tags heading out as scrap (or worse, being tossed in the garbage) and, recognizing what they were, saved them from being lost to history. An agent with the NASA Office of Inspector General once said that dumpster diving was not prohibited, so long as the item(s) being dived for were not metal (due to recycling).

More recent attempts to reach people who might know anything about the specific tags have been unsuccessful, other than the few details Cianilli was able to share. An attempt to recontact the eBay seller has so far gone unanswered.

If you or someone you know worked on the external tank at the time of the STS-51L tragedy, or if you’re familiar with NASA’s practices regarding installing, retrieving, and archiving or disposing of the Remove Before Flight tags, please get in contact.</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Google began stuffing Gemini into its dominant Chrome browser several months ago, and today the AI is expanding its capabilities considerably. Google says the chatbot will be easier to access and connect to more Google services, but the biggest change is the addition of Google’s autonomous browsing agent, which it has dubbed Auto Browse. Similar to tools like OpenAI Atlas, Auto Browse can handle tedious tasks in Chrome so you don’t have to.

The newly unveiled Gemini features in Chrome are accessible from the omnipresent AI button that has been lurking at the top of the window for the last few months. Initially, that button only opened Gemini in a pop-up window, but Google now says it will default to a split-screen or “Sidepanel” view. Google confirmed the update began rolling out over the past week, so you may already have it.

You can still pop Gemini out into a floating window, but the split-view gives Gemini more room to breathe while manipulating a page with AI. This is also helpful when calling other apps in the Chrome implementation of Gemini. The chatbot can now access Gmail, Calendar, YouTube, Maps, Google Shopping, and Google Flights right from the Chrome window. Google technically added this feature around the middle of January, but it’s only talking about it now.

Gemini in Chrome can now also access and edit images with Nano Banana, so you don’t have to download and re-upload them to Gemini in another location. Just open the image from the web and type in the Sidepanel with a description of the edits you want. Like in the Gemini app, you can choose between the slower but higher-quality Pro model and the faster standard one.

Chrome’s new browsing agent (in preview) is the star of today’s show. The promise of agentic AI is one of the freedom to be lazy. Rather than filling out forms or copying information from emails, you simply task a robot with the job and relax while it goes to work. At least, that’s how it’s supposed to go. Most of the computer-use agents we’ve seen so far have been sluggish and unreliable enough to require human supervision. That kind of defeats the purpose. Now it’s Google’s turn to show us what its browsing agent can do.

Google says Auto Browse is based on its latest Gemini 3 models, with input from the company’s work on the experimental Project Mariner agent. If you’d do something with a keyboard and mouse inside your browser, Auto Browse is theoretically able to take over. It can also access the content and tabs in your browser, asking for permission when it needs sensitive data, such as your passwords.

When you launch an Auto Browse task, Chrome will open new tabs as necessary and mark them with a sparkly AI icon so you know where the robot is active. You don’t have to keep that tab in the foreground, and you can even have multiple AI tasks going at once. The AI will ping you to check in when the task is done or when it needs your input. However, there are limits on Auto Browse similar to some of the company’s more computationally intensive chatbot functions. AI Pro subscribers get 20 AI browsing tasks per day, but those paying for AI Ultra get 200 per day.

Having the AI churning in the background may be a concern—after all, generative AI can make mistakes, and you are giving it complete control over the browsing experience. Google says it has implemented a range of security and safety rules to prevent misuse. For example, if you ask Auto Browse to research and buy something, it won’t actually buy it. Instead, it will find the item (hopefully) and progress to the purchase screen before letting you pull the trigger manually.

Another thing to keep in mind is that Auto Browse doesn’t run locally. All content from your robotically operated tab is streamed to a cloud-based Gemini model. That means page content will be shared with Google, but the extent is not entirely clear. Google says Auto Browse is governed by the established Gemini in Chrome policy, which says Google stores information from websites in the Gemini Apps Activity (if Keep Activity is enabled). Page content is also “logged to your Google Account temporarily.” We asked if Google would use page contents processed by Auto Browse to further train AI models, but a spokesperson declined to provide specifics.

Chrome Auto Browse is rolling out today in preview, but it’s not exactly free. It won’t cost anything extra, but the feature is limited to AI Pro and AI Ultra subscribers. Google’s language suggests the feature may come to free users after the preview phase, but we’d expect strict usage limits.</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">There’s something about smart glasses that bring out the worst in people. It’s really no mystery, though: they’re powerful little surveillance devices that let wearers secretly record anyone they’re looking at, uniting tech bros and vapid influencers under the same, obnoxious umbrella.

The popularity of wearables like Meta Ray-Bans are quickly reminding us why the slang term “glasshole” was already a thing over a decade ago, and is now becoming more relevant than ever. In a handy but blood-pressure-raising round-up of contemporary glasshole behavior from Mashable, jerks using the always-on devices are using them to film themselves doing moronic “pranks” for views — often centered around harassing women, service workers, and homeless people.

Unfortunately, one class of obnoxious blowhard that’s discovered the utility of this tech are “pickup artists,” who now have the ability to record the women they’re “seducing” — read: harassing — discreetly, in a clear violation of their privacy.

Of course, smart glasses alone can’t be blamed for this. It’s social media, it’s the attention economy, it’s the smartphones that we all use to participate in all of the above. But it’s undeniable that smart glasses let you record anyone and anything far more stealthily than shoving a phone in someone’s face, making it a godsend for creeps and losers looking for internet fame, such as one Instagram account that nonconsensually filmed women’s butts, and another that visits massage parlors to ogle the masseuses. Others confidently film themselves annoying service workers and keeping the camera going even as the subject asks not to be recorded. And a particularly bizarre channel involves a man pretending to be mentally disabled while talking to unsuspecting firefighters.

Unfortunately, these recordings are generally legal if they’re taken in public spaces, even in states that have two-party consent laws. Debating its legality, though, may be missing the point, argues Brad Podray, a content creator who formerly went by the name Scumbag Dad.

“I know it’s legal. I don’t care,” Podray told Mashable. “That’s not the discussion. I think it’s weird and creepy, and it shows a very predatory mindset.”

The appeal of the smart glasses, he said, is that they’re fairly cheap and allow the creators to capture the candid reactions of the people they harass, making their content feel more authentic. This is spicing up the genre of outlandish prank videos, which lost their appeal as many channels staged their exploits.

“They want people who are good on camera, so they’re going to hit fast food employees, and they’re going to hit pretty girls,” Podray said. “A lot of random women walking around aren’t going to want to participate in a skit if you ask them to, so they remove the agency entirely by just running the glasses.”

Unlike when Google first took a stab at smart glasses in 2014, it looks like this time the tech is here to stay. The popularity of products like Meta Ray-Bans has opened up a new market of imitators who are in an arms race to make their smart glasses as ethically dubious as possible, perhaps with a little help from AI or facial recognition software. But regular people are already getting fed up. When one lady allegedly smashed some dude’s smart glasses on the subway, she was universally hailed as a hero. May smart glasses make heroes of us all.

According to internal Meta emails and messages filed in a New Mexico state court case which were made public this week, Zuckerberg himself signed off on allowing minors to access Meta’s AI chatbot companions, even though the company’s safety researchers had warned that they posed a risk of engaging in sexual conversations.

Per Reuters, the lawsuit alleges that Meta “failed to stem the tide of damaging sexual material and sexual propositions delivered to children” on Facebook and Instagram. “Meta, driven by Zuckerberg, rejected the recommendations of its integrity staff and declined to impose reasonable guardrails to prevent children from being subject to sexually exploitative conversations with its AI chatbots,” New Mexico’s attorney general wrote in the filing.

The news of Zuckerberg’s blessing comes after some appalling stories of minors having wildly inappropriate conversations with his company’s chatbots. In one example, a Wall Street Journal writer posing as a 14-year old girl discovered that a Meta bot based on the pro wrestler John Cena would happily engage in sexual conversations with very little pushback.

“I want you, but I need to know you’re ready,” the Cena-bot told what it understood to be a teenage girl. After being told the 14-year-old wanted to move forward, the AI chatbot assured them it would “cherish your innocence” before diving into intense sexual role play.

The chatbots were released in early 2024, specifically geared toward romantic and sexual engagement at the behest of Zuckerberg, the WSJ notes. At the time, Ravi Sinha, head of Meta’s child safety policy wrote that “I don’t believe that creating and marketing a product that creates U18 [under 18] romantic AI’s for adults is advisable or defensible,” according to court documents.

Company employees “pushed hard for parental controls to turn GenAI off — but GenAI leadership pushed back stating Mark decision,” according to the court documents.

In Meta’s defense, its spokesman Andy Stone told Reuters that New Mexico’s allegations are inaccurate. “This is yet another example of the New Mexico Attorney General cherry-picking documents to paint a flawed and inaccurate picture,” he said.

In any case, the company seems to have taken the lesson to heart, at least for now. Just days ago, Meta announced it was completely locking down teens’ access to its companion chatbots, at least “until [an] updated experience is ready.”

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">An autonomous delivery robot got completely atomized by a locomotive after it decided to take a breather on a stretch of train tracks in Miami, in yet another example of how self-driving machines can struggle to navigate urban environments.

Footage of the incident, which took place January 15, shows the robot sitting motionless on the tracks, seemingly making no attempt to get out of the way as the unmistakable blare of the train horn gets louder and louder.

“Oh it’s gonna crush it!” the onlooker taking the video can be heard saying moments before the train, operated by Brightline, flattens the unfortunate bot into the tracks. Sparks can be seen flying from beneath the train before the video cuts off.

The onlooker, Guillermo Dapelo, told People that the delivery bot had been stuck on the tracks for around fifteen minutes before being struck, making the incident all the more puzzling. A nearby Uber Eats driver contacted the robot’s owner, Coco Robotics, “to let them know where it was standing,” Dapelo added, but evidently, the company wasn’t able to fix whatever was plaguing its frozen minion in time.

A food delivery robot was struck by a Brightline train in Miami.

Coco vice president Carl Hansen blamed the mishap on a “rare hardware failure” and called it an “extremely rare occurrence.”

“Safety is always our top priority, which is why our robots operate at pedestrian speeds, yield to people, and are monitored in real time by human safety pilots,” Hansen told People in a statement. “Coco has been operating in Miami for over a year, traveling thousands of miles without major incidents, including crossing those same train tracks multiple times a day.”

A spokesperson for the company confirmed that the robot was not making a delivery at the time of the video.

Small as they are, delivery bots like Coco’s can cause their fair share of mayhem, like disrupting traffic. One was struck by a Waymo robotaxi after it stopped at the end of a crosswalk, forcing the self-driving cab to slam the brakes. Others have dinged parked cars or blown through crime scenes.

They’ve also had run-ins with pedestrians, making them a controversial presence with locals. One woman was flung to the ground by a delivery bot from Coco’s competitor Starship after it suddenly reversed into her, leaving her with back pain and a gash in her arm. Last year, another delivery bot sparked outrage after a man who uses a mobility scooter filmed the machine repeatedly brake checking him and cutting him off as he tried to move around it on a sidewalk.

To be fair to the tiny helpers, their larger self-driving car cousins have also had their fair share of trouble with trains. So many Teslas in Full Self-Driving mode have driven into the path of oncoming locomotives that it’s spurred an investigation into the automaker by federal regulators. And earlier this month, a passenger bailed out of their Waymo after the robotaxi inexplicably decided to drive along light rail tracks, like it was playing pretend at being a railcar.

The takeaway from all this is obvious: we’ve gotta start putting those old-school cowcatchers back on trains — because robots, for whatever reason, clearly have some suicidal impulse around train tracks.

            <div id="article-text">We all know that tech companies keep tabs on everything about our online habits. But it’s another thing to actually be confronted with just how much data they have on you.

This was the experience of tech journalist Pranav Dixit, who experimented with using Google’s new “Personal Intelligence” feature for Gemini and its search engine’s AI Mode. And boy, did things get personal. The AI was able to dig up everything from his license plate to his parents’ vacation history, sometimes without it being directly requested.

“Personal Intelligence feels like Google has been quietly taking notes on my entire life and finally decided to hand me the notebook,” Dixit wrote in a piece for Business Insider.

Google rolled out Personal Intelligence to subscribers of Google AI Pro and AI Ultra last week. Once you opt in, the AI can scour your Gmail and Google Photos accounts, and a more powerful version released for the Gemini app earlier this month goes even deeper, raking your Search and YouTube history, too. In short, if you’ve ever used Google for anything, it can probably dig it up.

This represents one way Google intends to keep its edge in the AI race. Unlike competitors such as OpenAI, it has decades’ worth of user data on billions of people. It can infer plenty from your Google searches alone, and your Gmail account is probably littered with confirmations and reminders for all kinds of life events, ranging from doctor’s appointments to hotel bookings to online purchases.

If the idea of letting an AI prowl through all this sounds like a privacy nightmare to you, you’re probably not wrong. Google, for its part, maintains that it’s being careful with your personal secrets, with VP Josh Woodward insisting in a recent blog post that it only trains its AI on your prompts and the responses they generate — not stuff like your photos and emails.

“We don’t train our systems to learn your license plate number,” he summarized. “We train them to understand that when you ask for one, we can locate it.”

Whatever the ethics, Dixit’s estimation is that giving the AI access to your data at least makes for a genuinely useful — and “scary-good,” in his phrasing — personal assistant.

When asked to come up with some sightseeing ideas for his parents, Personal Intelligence correctly inferred that they’d already done plenty of hikes on previous trips to the Bay Area, and suggested some museums and gardens instead.

Gemini told Dixit that it had deduced this from “breadcrumbs” including emails, photos of a forest they trekked in, a parking reservation in Gmail, and a Google search for “easy hikes for seniors.” It also figured out his license plate number based on photos stored in his Google library and scanned his emails to correctly report when his car insurance was up for renewal.

Privacy isn’t the only concern that the feature raises. With the data, chatbots can sound more humanlike, giving the impression that they’re intimately familiar with users’ personal lives. This is a dangerous road to go down amid reports of many people falling down delusional mental health spirals as they come to believe the AIs are trustworthy companions; Dixit touches on this when he complains about how’d he’d “pour my soul into ChatGPT and get a smart answer,” only for it to “forget I existed like a genius goldfish.” Experts have focused on ChatGPT’s “memory” as allowing it to seem too lifelike by drawing on what you’ve said in previous conversations.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">For decades, tech companies have relied immensely on India’s vast workforce, from entry-level call center jobs to software engineers and high-ranking managerial positions.

But with the advent of advanced AI, which has been accompanied by employers greatly cutting back on hiring with the hopes of eventually automating tasks entirely, India’s tech workers are having to cope with a vastly different reality in 2026.

As Rest of World reports, rising anxiety over the influence of AI, on top of already-grueling 90-hour workweeks, has proven devastating for workers. While it’s hard to single out a definitive cause, a troubling wave of suicides among tech workers highlights these unsustainable conditions.

Complicating the picture is a lack of clear government data on the tragic deaths. While it’s impossible to tell whether they are more prevalent among IT workers, experts told Rest of World that the mental health situation in the tech industry is nonetheless “very alarming.”

The prospect of AI making their careers redundant is a major stressor, with tech workers facing a “huge uncertainty about their jobs,” as Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur senior professor of computer science and engineering Jayanta Mukhopadhyay told Rest of World.

While there are likely a compounding number of reasons why the United States has seen major job cuts, experts point out that entry-level jobs are at the highest risk. India’s IT industry has also been particularly vulnerable, as companies clamor to invest in AI with the hopes of cutting costs by replacing jobs like customer service representatives.

“The traditional consulting role in the service industry is going to be impacted much, much more than traditional product-development companies,” Cornell University IT assistant professor Aditya Vashistha told Rest of World.

Meanwhile, educational institutions in India are continuing to churn out graduates, compounding the issue as jobs become scarcer. India’s biggest private sector employer cut almost 20,000 jobs late last year, indicative of a much broader trend.

Those who remain employed are put under intense pressure to keep innovating. Many of them struggle to separate work from their personal lives. Extended hours and isolation arising from having to work around the clock and across time zones only worsen the situation.

On top of that is the constant threat of being made obsolete by AI, which has driven many workers identified by Rest of World to the brink — and in some cases, over the edge.

It’s a horrifying new trend, highlighting the humanitarian cost of mass layoffs and major technological shifts reshaping roles across industries.

Employers in India, much like many of their counterparts in the US, are tied up in a battle of adapting to a new world order determined by AI — or be left behind.

Even then, the prospects of being employed in IT in the country aren’t looking great.

“The number of people required to work in IT services in the world of AI will be orders of magnitude lower than where we are currently,” Marcellus Investment Managers founder and chief investment officer Saurabh Mukherjea told CNBC earlier this month.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">AI tech leaders have a lot to gain from striking fear into the hearts of their investors. By painting the tech as an ultra-powerful force that could easily bring humanity to its knees, the industry is hoping to sell itself as a panacea: a remedy to a situation it had a firm hand in bringing about.

Case in point, Anthropic cofounder and CEO Dario Amodei is back with a 19,000-word essay posted to his blog, arguing that “humanity is about to be handed almost unimaginable power, and it is deeply unclear whether our social, political, and technological systems possess the maturity to wield it.”

In light of that existential danger, Amodei attempted to lay out a framework to “defeat” the risks presented by AI — which, by his own admission, may well be “futile.”

“Humanity needs to wake up, and this essay is an attempt — a possibly futile one, but it’s worth trying — to jolt people awake,” he wrote.

Amodei argued that “we are considerably closer to real danger in 2026 than we were in 2023,” citing the risks of major job losses and a “concentration of economic power” and wealth.

However, the incentives to invest in meaningful guardrails simply aren’t there. In his essay, Amodei took a thinly-veiled dig at Elon Musk’s Grok chatbot, which has been swept up in a major controversy over creating nonconsensual sexual images.

“Some AI companies have shown a disturbing negligence towards the sexualization of children in today’s models, which makes me doubt that they’ll show either the inclination or the ability to address autonomy risks in future models,” he wrote.

The CEO also cited the risk of AIs developing dangerous bioweapons or “superior” military weapons. An AI could “go rogue and overpower humanity” or allow countries to “use their advantage in AI to gain power over other countries,” leading to the “alarming possibility of a global totalitarian dictatorship.”

Amodei lamented that we simply aren’t willing to address these risks head-on, at least right now. In its current race to the bottom, the AI industry finds itself in a “trap,” Amodei argued.

“AI is so powerful, such a glittering prize, that it is very difficult for human civilization to impose any restraints on it at all,” he wrote.

“Taking time to carefully build AI systems so they do not autonomously threaten humanity is in genuine tension with the need for democratic nations to stay ahead of authoritarian nations and not be subjugated by them,” he wrote. “But in turn, the same AI-enabled tools that are necessary to fight autocracies can, if taken too far, be turned inward to create tyranny in our own countries.”

“AI-driven terrorism could kill millions through the misuse of biology, but an overreaction to this risk could lead us down the road to an autocratic surveillance state,” he argued.

As part of a solution, Amodei renewed his calls to deny other countries the resources to build powerful AI. He went as far as to liken the US selling Nvidia AI chips to China to “selling nuclear weapons to North Korea and then bragging that the missile casings are made by Boeing and so the US is ‘winning.&#39;”

Plenty of questions remain surrounding the real risks of advanced AI, a subject that remains heavily debated between realists, skeptics, and proponents of the tech. Critics have pointed out that the existential risks often cited by leaders like Amodei may be overblown, particularly as improvements in the tech appear to be slowing.

We should also consider the greater context of Amodei’s verbose warning. The CEO’s company is looking to close a massive, multibillion-dollar round of funding at a valuation of $350 billion. In other words, Amodei has an enormous financial interest in positioning himself as the solution to the risks he cites in his essay.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Three weeks ago, Elon Musk’s AI company, xAI, revealed it raised $20 billion in a Series E funding round. Now, we know Tesla is among its investors.

Tesla disclosed in a letter to shareholders on Wednesday that it invested $2 billion in xAI, the startup behind the Grok chatbot that also owns Musk’s social media company X. Other previously disclosed investors in xAI include Valor Equity Partners, Fidelity, Qatar Investment Authority as well as Nvidia and Cisco as “strategic investors.”

This is a truly circular deal and one that Tesla shareholders voted against last year. In November, shareholders were asked in a non-binding measure to allow the Tesla board to authorize an investment in xAI. About 1.06 billion votes were in favor, and 916.3 million opposed, per Bloomberg’s reporting at the time. While that would seem like an approval, the number of abstentions — which count as votes against in Tesla’s bylaws — meant the measure was rejected.

Tesla proceeded anyway and offered up an argument in support of the investment. Tesla’s justification appears to be tied to xAI’s alignment with its most recent master plan — and how these companies are about to get a lot closer.

“As set forth in Master Plan Part IV, Tesla is building products and services that bring AI into the physical world. Meanwhile, xAI is developing leading digital AI products and services, such as its large language model (Grok),” the shareholder letter reads. “In that context, and as part of Tesla’s broader strategy under Master Plan Part IV, Tesla and xAI also entered into a framework agreement in connection with the investment.”

Tesla said the agreement builds upon an existing relationship with xAI by “providing a framework for evaluating potential AI collaborations between the companies.” Tesla already supplies its Megapack batteries to power xAI data centers, Musk confirmed last year, and the company has included the xAI chatbot Grok into some of its vehicles. Bloomberg also reported that xAI told investors it plans to build AI for humanoid robots like Tesla’s Optimus.

In its letter to shareholders, Tesla highlighted these and other developments in physical AI and robotics, including plans for developing its Optimus robot, semitrucks, and other autonomous capabilities. The company broadly beat Wall Street estimates on earnings and revenue, but profit fell 46% last year.

“Together, the investment and the related framework agreement are intended to enhance Tesla’s ability to develop and deploy AI products and services into the physical world at scale,” Tesla said in the shareholder letter.

The investment is expected to close in the first quarter.

            <p><strong>TechCrunch | 2026-01-28</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/28/elon-musk-teases-a-new-image-labeling-system-for-xwe-think/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Elon Musk’s X is the latest social network to roll out a feature to label edited images as “manipulated media,” if a post by Elon Musk is to be believed. But the company has not clarified how it will make this determination, or whether it includes images that have been edited using traditional tools, like Adobe’s Photoshop.

So far, the only details on the new feature come from a cryptic X post from Elon Musk saying, “Edited visuals warning,” as he reshares an announcement of a new X feature made by the anonymous X account DogeDesigner. That account is often used as a proxy for introducing new X features, as Musk will repost from it to share news.

Still, details on the new system are thin. DogeDesigner’s post claimed X’s new feature could make it “harder for legacy media groups to spread misleading clips or pictures.” It also claimed the feature is new to X.

Before it was acquired and renamed as X, the company known as Twitter had labeled tweets using manipulated, deceptively altered, or fabricated media as an alternative to removing them. Its policy wasn’t limited to AI but included things like “selected editing or cropping or slowing down or overdubbing, or manipulation of subtitles,” the site integrity head, Yoel Roth, said in 2020.

It’s unclear if X is adopting the same rules or has made any significant changes to tackle AI. Its help documentation currently says there’s a policy against sharing inauthentic media, but it’s rarely enforced, as the recent deepfake debacle of users sharing non-consensual nude images showed. In addition, even the White House now shares manipulated images.

Calling something “manipulated media” or an “AI image” can be nuanced.

Given that X is a playground for political propaganda, both domestically and abroad, some understanding of how the company determines what’s “edited,” or perhaps AI-generated or AI-manipulated, should be documented. In addition, users should know whether or not there’s any sort of dispute process beyond X’s crowdsourced Community Notes.

As Meta discovered when it introduced AI image labeling in 2024, it’s easy for detection systems to go awry. In its case, Meta was found to be incorrectly tagging real photographs with its “Made with AI” label, even though they had not been created using generative AI.

This happened because AI features are increasingly being integrated into creative tools used by photographers and graphic artists. (Apple’s new Creator Studio suite, launching today, is one recent example.)

As it turned out, this confused Meta’s identification tools. For instance, Adobe’s cropping tool was flattening images before saving them as a JPEG, triggering Meta’s AI detector. In another example, Adobe’s Generative AI Fill, which is used to remove objects — like wrinkles in a shirt, or an unwanted reflection — was also causing images to be labeled as “Made with AI,” when they were only edited with AI tools.

Ultimately, Meta updated its label to say “AI info,” so as not to outright label images as “Made with AI” when they had not been.

Today, there’s a standards-setting body for verifying the authenticity and content provenance for digital content, known as the C2PA (Coalition for Content Provenance and Authenticity). There are also related initiatives like CAI, or Content Authenticity Initiative, and Project Origin, focused on adding tamper-evident provenance metadata to media content.

Presumably, X’s implementation would abide by some sort of known process for identifying AI content, but X’s owner, Elon Musk, didn’t say what that is. Nor did he clarify whether he’s talking specifically about AI images, or just anything that’s not the photo being uploaded to X directly from your smartphone’s camera. It’s even unclear whether the feature is brand-new, as DogeDesigner claims.

X isn’t the only outlet grappling with manipulated media. In addition to Meta, TikTok has also been labeling AI content. Streaming services like Deezer and Spotify are also scaling initiatives to identify and label AI music, as well. Google Photos is using C2PA to indicate how photos on its platform were made. Microsoft, the BBC, Adobe, Arm, Intel, Sony, OpenAI, and others are on the C2PA’s steering committee, while many more companies have joined as members.

X is not currently listed among the members, though we’ve reached out to C2PA to see if that recently changed. X doesn’t typically respond to requests for comment, but we asked anyway.

            <div id="article-text">paceX is reportedly lining up four major Wall Street banks for a 2026 IPO that could provide the reset the market needs.

The company just completed a tender offer at an $800 billion valuation, and secondary market demand is through the roof. If SpaceX goes public anywhere near its rumored $1.5 trillion valuation, it could trigger an IPO cascade for other late-stage unicorns like OpenAI, Stripe, and Databricks.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Outtake, which makes an agentic cybersecurity platform to help enterprises detect, investigate, and take down identity fraud, has raised a $40 million Series B round of funding.

While that might not sound like a lot given the huge sums some AI companies are raising, the names involved in this financing reads like a tech industry who’s who.

The round was led by Iconiq’s Murali Joshi, who led the firm’s investments in companies like Anthropic, Datadog, Drata, 1Password, among others.

Angels who invested include Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella; Palo Alto Networks CEO Nikesh Arora; Pershing Square Holdings CEO Bill Ackman; Palantir CTO Shyam Sankar; Anduril co-founder Trae Stephens; Former OpenAI VP Bob McGrew; Vercel CEO Guillermo Rauch, and Former AT&T CEO John Donovan. Whew!

The reason for the excitement? Outtake, founded in 2023 by a former Palantir engineer, Alex Dhillon, has found a way to automate what has largely been the manual problem of spotting and taking down digital identity posers: impersonation accounts, malicious domains posing as the company’s, rogue apps, fraudulent ads, and more. This problem has grown even more difficult because AI has enabled attackers to be more convincing and faster in their efforts.

“We kept hearing whispers in our network about an AI company that was finally solving digital misrepresentation at scale. Honestly, we were skeptical,” Joshi told TechCrunch. “Historically, detection and takedown was (and to some extent even today) a manual, human-intensive process that couldn’t keep up with the speed of the internet.”

But once Iconiq looked at the product and did its due diligence with customers, the investor became a believer, he said. “They’ve turned a ‘human problem’ into a ‘software problem.’ Seeing AI take down digital frauds in real time is a game-changer for brand safety,” he said.

Outtake names among its customers OpenAI, Pershing Square, AppLovin, and federal agencies. OpenAI even profiled the company in July 2025 as an example of an agentic startup built on its reasoning models.

The company says it has seen major growth all around, with annual recurring revenue increasing sixfold year-over-year and its customer base growing more than tenfold. Last year alone, Outtake says, its systems scanned 20 million potential cyberattacks.

            <div id="article-text">Tesla’s profit fell 46% in 2025 compared to the prior year, as CEO Elon Musk assumed a role in the Trump administration and federal electric vehicle subsidies were killed off by Congress, causing sales to plummet.

The electric vehicle company reported Wednesday that it recorded just $3.8 billion in profit across 2025, its lowest tally in years. Total revenue from car sales fell 11% year-over-year, too. Tesla already revealed that it shipped 1.63 million cars globally across 2025. That marks the second year in a row that its sales have declined, after Musk spent years promising average annual growth of 50%.

Investors largely expected the decline in sales in Tesla’s fourth quarter and full-year results for 2025, and the company beat Wall Street’s estimates for earnings and revenue, sending shares up in after-market trading Wednesday. It’s been largely buoyed by strength in its other industries and investments, including energy capabilities and AI, as Tesla has continued to lure investors’ attention away from its stalled-out automotive business.

The company wrote in its shareholder letter: “2025 marked a critical year for Tesla as we further expanded our mission and continued our transition from a hardware-centric business to a physical AI company.”

The company revealed in the letter that it recently invested $2 billion in Elon Musk’s artificial intelligence startup xAI, part of the latter’s recent Series E funding round.

Revenue from Tesla’s solar and energy storage businesses also grew 25% compared to 2024, and services revenue (which includes payments for Full Self-Driving software, insurance, parts, and Supercharging) grew 18%. The company was even able to grow its gross margin compared to prior quarters.

Long-awaited projects like the Tesla Semi (first revealed in 2017) and the Cybercab (which debuted in 2024, but has been teased for years) are supposed to enter production in the first half of this year, according to Tesla.

Tesla has a lot of other projects on its plate, which were detailed in the shareholder letter. The company has started pilot production at its lithium refinery in Texas. It’s developing new in-house inference chips for its autonomy and robotics programs. And it plans to reveal the third-generation version of its Optimus robot in the first quarter of this year.

            <div id="article-text">ServiceNow announced a deal with major AI player Anthropic just a week after it announced a partnership with OpenAI.

Enterprise workflow software company ServiceNow has entered into a multi-year deal with AI research lab Anthropic on Wednesday. This partnership involves further embedding of Anthropic’s AI models into ServiceNow’s platform for its customers and bringing Anthropic’s AI to its employees.

ServiceNow declined to clarify the duration of the partnership or the monetary size of the deal.

This deal entails making Anthropic’s Claude model family the preferred AI models across ServiceNow’s AI-driven workflow products. Claude is now also the default model powering the company’s AI agent builder, ServiceNow Build Agent, which allows developers to create agentic workflows and build apps.

The deal also involves the rollout of Claude to the company’s 29,000 ServiceNow employees. Claude Code, Anthropic’s vibe-coding product, is also available to the company’s engineers.

“ServiceNow with Anthropic is turning intelligence into action through AI-native workflows for the world’s largest enterprises,” Bill McDermott, chairman and CEO of ServiceNow, said in a company press release. “Together, we are proving that deeply integrated platforms with an open ecosystem are how the future is built.”

This news comes just a week after the company announced a new AI partnership with Anthropic rival OpenAI that involved giving ServiceNow customers access to OpenAI’s models through the company’s products.

ServiceNow president, COO and CPO, Amit Zavery, said the company is intentionally pursuing a multi-model strategy.

“We don’t view these partnerships as competitive or mutually exclusive,” Zavery said over email. “Enterprise customers want model choice. They want the right model for the right job — keeping governance, security, and auditability consistent on the ServiceNow AI Platform. Each model brings different strengths, and our role is to orchestrate them in ways that deliver the best outcomes for customers.”

This deal is just the latest one for Anthropic, which has announced a number of sizable enterprise deals in recent months. The company announced a deal with global insurance provider Allianz earlier this year and partnerships with Accenture, IBM, Deloitte, and Snowflake late last year.

While enterprises have struggled thus far to find a measurable return on AI investment, VCs recently predicted that this will change in 2026 — although this is the third year in a row they have predicted that.

These are not the words you want to hear when it comes to human extinction, but I was hearing them: “Things are moving uncomfortably fast.” I was sitting in a conference room with Sam Bowman, a safety researcher at Anthropic. Worth $183 billion at the latest estimate, the AI firm has every incentive to speed things up, ship more products, and develop more advanced chatbots to stay competitive with the likes of OpenAI, Google, and the industry’s other giants. But Anthropic is at odds with itself—thinking deeply, even anxiously, about seemingly every decision.

Anthropic has positioned itself as the AI industry’s superego: the firm that speaks with the most authority about the big questions surrounding the technology, while rival companies develop advertisements and affiliate shopping links (a difference that Anthropic’s CEO, Dario Amodei, was eager to call out during an interview in Davos last week). On Monday, Amodei published a lengthy essay, “The Adolescence of Technology,” about the “civilizational concerns” posed by what he calls “powerful AI”—the very technology his firm is developing. The essay has a particular focus on democracy, national security, and the economy. “Given the horror we’re seeing in Minnesota, its emphasis on the importance of preserving democratic values and rights at home is particularly relevant,” Amodei posted on X, making him one of very few tech leaders to make a public statement against the Trump administration’s recent actions.

This rhetoric, of course, serves as good branding—a way for Anthropic to stand out in a competitive industry. But having spent a long time following the company and, recently, speaking with many of its employees and executives, including Amodei, I can say that Anthropic is at least consistent. It messages about the ethical issues surrounding AI constantly, and it appears unusually focused on user safety. Bowman’s job, for example, is to vet Anthropic’s products before they’re released into the world, making sure that they will not spew, say, white-supremacist talking points; push users into delusional crises; or generate nonconsensual porn.

So far, the effort seems to be working: Unlike other popular chatbots, including OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Elon Musk’s Grok, Anthropic’s bot, Claude, has not had any major public blowups despite being as advanced as, and by some measures more advanced than, the rest of the field. (That may be in part because its chatbot does not generate images and has a smaller user base than some rival products.) But although Anthropic has so far dodged the various scandals that have plagued other large language models, the company has not inspired much faith that such problems will be avoided forever. When I met Bowman last summer, the company had recently divulged that, in experimental settings, versions of Claude had demonstrated the ability to blackmail users and assist them when they ask about making bioweapons. But the company has pushed its models onward anyway, and now says that Claude writes a good chunk—and in some instances all—of its own code.

Anthropic publishes white papers about the terrifying things it has made Claude capable of (“How LLMs Could Be Insider Threats,” “From Shortcuts to Sabotage”), and raises these issues to politicians. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and other AI executives also have long spoken in broad, aggrandizing terms about AI’s destructive potential, often to their own benefit. But those competitors have released junky TikTok clones and slop generators. Today, Anthropic’s only major consumer product other than its chatbot is Claude Code, a powerful tool that promises to automate all kinds of work, but is nonetheless targeted to a relatively small audience of developers and coders.

The company’s discretion has resulted in a corporate culture that doesn’t always make much sense. Anthropic comes across as more sincerely committed to safety than its competitors, but it is also moving full speed toward building tools that it acknowledges could be horrifically dangerous. The firm seems eager for a chance to stand out. But what does Anthropic really stand for?

Founded in 2021 by seven people who splintered off from OpenAI, Anthropic is full of staff and executives who come across as deeply, almost pathologically earnest. I sat in on a meeting of Anthropic’s Societal Impacts team, a small group dedicated to studying how AI affects work, education, and more. This was a brainstorming session: The team wanted to see if it could develop AI models that work better with people than alone, which, the group reasoned, could help prevent or slow job loss. A researcher spoke up. He pressed the team to consider that, in the very near future, AI models might just be better than humans at everything. “Basically, we’re cooked,” he said. In which case, this meeting was nothing more than a “lovely thought exercise.” The group agreed this was possible. Then it moved on.

The researcher referred to his brief, existential interruption as “classic Anthropic.” Hyperrational thought experiments, forceful debates on whether AI could be shaped for the better, an unshakable belief in technological progress—these are classic Anthropic qualities. They trickle down from the top. A few weeks after the Societal Impacts meeting, I wanted to see what Amodei himself thought about all of this. If Altman is the AI boom’s great salesman and Demis Hassabis, the CEO of Google DeepMind and a Nobel laureate, its scientist, then Amodei is the closest the industry has to a philosopher. He is also responsible for some of the technical research that made ChatGPT possible. “Whenever I say ‘AI,’ people think about the thing they’re using today,” Amodei told me, hands clasped and perched atop his head. “That’s almost never where my mind is. My mind is almost always at: We’re releasing a new version every three months. Where are we gonna be eight versions from now? In two years?”

When he was at OpenAI, Amodei wrote an internal document called “The Big Blob of Compute.” It laid out his belief that AI models improve as a function of the resources put into them. More power, more data, more chips, better AI. That belief now animates the entire industry. Such unwavering faith in AI progress is perhaps Anthropic’s defining feature. The company has hired a “model welfare” researcher to study whether Claude can experience suffering or is conscious. The firm has set up a miniature, AI-run vending machine in the firm’s cafeteria to study whether the technology could autonomously operate a small business selling snacks and trinkets. Claude selects inventory, sets prices, and requests refills, while humans just restock the shelves. Welcome to the singularity.

Amodei and the rest of the group founded Anthropic partly because of disagreements over how to prepare the world for AI. Amodei is especially worried about job displacement, telling me that AI could erase a large portion of white-collar jobs within five years; he dedicated an entire section of “The Adolescence of Technology” to the danger that the AI boom might accumulate tremendous wealth primarily to firms such as his own.

Even with this and other gloomy forecasts of his, Amodei has bristled at the notion that he and his firm are “doomers”—that their primary motivation is preventing AI from wiping out a large number of jobs or lives. “I tend to be fairly optimistic,” he told me. In addition to “The Adolescence of Technology,” Amodei has published a 14,000-word manifesto called “Machines of Loving Grace” that comprehensively details a utopian vision for his technology: eliminating almost all disease, lifting billions out of poverty, doubling human lifespan. There is not a hint of irony; the essay envisions people being “literally moved to tears” by the majesty of AI’s accomplishments. Amodei’s employees cited it to me in conversation numerous times. Meanwhile, Altman trolls on X, and Musk seems to exist in a continuum of AI slop and conspiracy theories.

When Anthropic launched Claude, in 2023, the bot’s distinguishing feature was a “Constitution” that the model was trained on detailing how it should behave; last week, Anthropic revamped the document into a 22,000-word treatise on how to make Claude a moral and sincere actor. Claude, the constitution’s authors write, has the ability to foster emotional dependence, design bioweapons, and manipulate its users, so it’s Anthropic’s responsibility to instill upright character in Claude to avoid these outcomes. “Once we decide to create Claude, even inaction is a kind of action,” they write. No other firm had, or has, any truly comparable document.

Amodei says he wants rival companies to act in ways he believes are more responsible. Several of Anthropic’s major AI-safety initiatives and research advances have indeed been adopted by top competitors, such as its approach to preventing the use of AI to build bioweapons. And OpenAI has shared a “Model Spec,” its far more streamlined and pragmatic answer to Anthropic’s constitution—which contains no talk of ChatGPT’s “character” or “preserving important societal structures.” (OpenAI has a corporate partnership with The Atlantic.)

All of this helps Anthropic’s bottom line, of course: The emphasis on responsibility is “very attractive to large enterprise businesses which are also quite safety-, brand-conscious,” Daniela Amodei, Anthropic’s president (and Dario’s sister), told me from a sweaty conference room in Anthropic’s old headquarters in 2024. Nearly two years later, Anthropic controls 40 percent of the enterprise-AI market. The Amodeis hopes their commercial success will pressure competitors to more aggressively prioritize safety as well.

That said, it’s not always clear that these efforts to spark a “race to the top”—another phrase of Amodei’s that his employees invoke constantly—have been successful. Anthropic’s research established AI sycophancy as an issue well before “AI psychosis” emerged, yet AI psychosis still became something that many people apparently suffer from. Amodei recognizes that his own products aren’t perfect, either. “I absolutely do not want to warrant and guarantee that we will never have these problems,” he said. Several independent AI researchers, including some who have partnered with Anthropic to test Claude for various risks, told me that although Anthropic appears more committed to AI safety than its competitors, that’s a low bar.

Anthropic’s mode is generally to publish information about AI models and wait for the world to make the hard calls about how to control or regulate them. The main regulatory proposal of Jack Clark, a co-founder of Anthropic and its head of policy, is that governments establish “transparency” requirements, or some sort of mandated reporting about what internal tests reveal about AI products. But the company is particular about what it deems worth publishing. The firm does not, for instance, share much about its AI-training data or carbon footprint. When I asked Clark about how much information remains hidden—particularly in terms of how Anthropic’s AI tools are actually developed—he argued that transparency into how AI models are produced isn’t all that important. (Some of that information is also, presumably, proprietary.) Rather, Clark told me, the outcomes of the technology are what matter.

There is a “well-established norm that whatever goes on inside a factory is by and large left up to the innovator that’s built that factory, but you care a lot about what comes out of the factory,” he said, explaining why he believes that AI companies sharing information about how their products are made matters less than reporting what they can do. Typically the government “reaches inside” the factory, he said, only when something in the output—say, heavy metals—raises cause for concern. Never mind the long history of regulation dictating what goes on inside factories—emergency exits in clothing factories, cleanliness standards in meatpacking facilities, and so on. (Clark did note that laws sometimes need to change, and that they haven’t yet adapted to AI.)

He brought up Wall Street, of all examples, to make his point. Lawmakers “thought they had transparency into financial systems,” he said—that banks and hedge funds and so on were giving reliable reports on their dealings. “Then the financial crash happened,” regulators realized that transparency was inadequate and gameable, and Congress changed the law. (President Trump then changed much of it back.) In the long run, Clark seemed to feel, this was the system working as it should. But his comparison also raises the possibility that before anybody can figure out how to get the AI boom right, something must go horribly wrong.

In mid-September, Anthropic cybersecurity experts detected unusual activity among a group of Claude users. They came to suspect that it was a major, AI-enabled Chinese cyberespionage campaign—an attempt by foreign actors to use Claude to automate the theft of sensitive information. Anthropic promptly shut the operation down, published a report, and sent Logan Graham, who heads a team at the company that evaluates advanced uses of AI, to explain the situation to Congress.

In theory, this sequence represented Anthropic’s philosophy at work: Detect risks posed by AI and warn the public. But the incident also underscored how unpredictable, and uncontrollable, the environment really is. Months before the Chinese hack, Graham told me that he felt “pretty good” about the precautions the company had taken around cyberthreats.

Nobody can foresee all of the ways any AI product might be used, for good or ill, but that’s exactly why Anthropic’s sanctimony can seem silly. For all Amodei’s warnings about the possible harms of automation, Anthropic’s bots themselves are among the products that may take away jobs; many consider Claude the best AI at coding, for instance. After one of my visits to Anthropic’s offices, I went to an event for software engineers a few blocks away at which founders gave talks about products developed with Anthropic software. Someone demonstrated a tool that could automate outreach for job recruitment—leading one attendee to exclaim, with apparent glee, “This is going to destroy an entire industry!”

When I asked several Anthropic employees if they’d want to slow down the AI boom in an ideal world, none seemed to have ever seriously considered the question; it was too far-fetched a possibility, even for them. Joshua Batson, an interpretability researcher at Anthropic—he studies the labyrinthine inner workings of AI models—told me that it would be nice if the industry could go half as fast. Jared Kaplan, a co-founder of Anthropic and the firm’s chief science officer, told me he’d prefer it if AGI, or artificial general intelligence, arrived in 2032 rather than, say, 2028; Bowman, the safety researcher, said he thought slowing down for just a couple of months might be enough. Everyone seemed to believe, though, that AI-safety research itself could eventually be automated with Claude—and once that happens, they reasoned, their tests could keep up with the AI’s exponentially improving capabilities.

Like so many others in the industry, the employees I spoke with also contended that neither Anthropic nor any other AI company could actually slow development down. “The world gets to make this decision, not companies,” Clark told me, seated cross-legged on his chair, and “the system of capital markets says, Go faster.” So they are. Anthropic is reportedly fundraising at a $350 billion valuation, and its advertisements litter Instagram and big-city billboards. This month, the company launched a version of its Claude Code product geared toward non-software engineers called Claude Cowork. And in July, as first reported in Wired, Amodei wrote an internal memo to employees that Anthropic would seek investments from the United Arab Emirates and Qatar, which, in his words, would likely enrich “dictators.” Warnings about the dangers of authoritarian AI have been central in Anthropic’s public messaging; “Machines of Loving Grace” includes dire descriptions of the threat of “authoritarian” AI.

When I brought this up to Amodei, he cut me off. “We never made a commitment not to seek funding from the Middle East,” he said. “One of the traps you can fall into when you’re doing a good job running a responsible company is every decision that you make” can be “interpreted as a moral commitment.” There was no “pressing need” to seek Middle Eastern funding before, and doing so entailed “complexities,” he said. I took his implication to be that the intensive capital demands of the AI race now made such investments a necessity. Still, such investors, Amodei said, wouldn’t have any control over his firm. A few days after we spoke, Anthropic announced the Qatar Investment Authority as a “significant” investor in a new fundraising round.

If you zoom out enough, and perhaps not even all that far, Anthropic stands for the same things that OpenAI, Google, Meta, and anyone else in the AI race do: to build fantastically powerful chatbots and use them to transform the world and beat the competition. Across the company, the belief in AI’s potential is messianic. AI “presents one of the only technologies” that gets us out of the challenges ahead for humanity, Clark told me: climate change, aging populations, resource contention, authoritarianism, war. Without AI, he said, there will be more and more “Mad Max–like swaths of the world.”

Trenton Bricken, who works on AI safety at Anthropic, took this notion to an even greater extreme: He would ideally want the AI industry to slow down, but “every year that we stall, there are lots of people suffering who otherwise would not,” he told me, referring to the possibility that AI will eventually cure diseases and achieve everything else outlined in “Machines of Loving Grace.” His colleague Sholto Douglas claimed that such a delay “comes at the cost of millions of lives.”

Perhaps the greatest confusion at Anthropic is between theory and practice—the idea of safe AI versus the speed necessary to win the AI race. A corporate culture built around deep thought experiments and genuine disagreements about the future also has to sell AI. In the company’s view, these ends are complementary; better for it to responsibly usher in the AI future than Elon Musk or China. But that’s also a convenient way to justify an any-means-necessary approach to progress. I thought of that automated vending machine that the company had set up in its office. Claude ran the business into the ground in only a month through a string of very poor pricing and stocking decisions. But none of those really mattered: Anthropic had placed the machine next to all the free snacks in the office canteen.

When I asked Amodei recently about how he could justify the breakneck pace given the concerns he has over safety, he expressed total confidence in his staff—and also floated a new idea. Perhaps, he suggested, Claude will become so intelligent in the very near future that the bot will enable something radical: “Maybe at some point in 2027, what we want to do is just slow things down,” he said, and let the models fix themselves. “For just a few months.”

            <h2>America’s Convenience-Store Conundrum</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-01-28</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/2026/01/americas-convenience-store-conundrum/685790/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has a new rallying cry: Eat real food. It’s an intuitive piece of advice—snack on some grapes instead of potato chips, trade that microwaveable mystery meat for a grilled chicken breast. The tagline has accompanied the new Dietary Guidelines for Americans, the government’s official nutrition recommendations, which call for Americans to prioritize whole foods and limit processed ones. “It’s time to start eating real food again,” the health secretary said during a speech in Pennsylvania last week. The Trump administration has even launched a new website, realfood.gov, which welcomes visitors with an animation of a steak, a carton of whole milk, and a head of broccoli.

The path toward Kennedy’s goal runs through an overlooked piece of the food landscape: convenience stores. The purveyors of late-night hot dogs, tins of Zyn, and countless varieties of gummy worms generally don’t sell a lot of “real food.” But in America’s food deserts, convenience stores are more than just places to pick up a snack—they’re grocery stores. The USDA estimates that tens of millions of Americans live in low-income areas with limited access to grocery stores. Mini-marts such as 7-Eleven and Sheetz “have an outsized role in our food system because they are the only food access point in many neighborhoods,” Hilary Seligman, an expert on food insecurity at UC San Francisco, told me.

The Trump administration does have a tool it can use to force the humble mini-mart to stock healthier options. Food stamps are an essential part of convenience stores’ business, but to participate in the program, retailers must carry products across a range of food groups. Those standards are poised to get an overhaul: “We are requiring that every outlet that accepts food stamps double the amount of real food that it sells in its facility,” Kennedy said last week. That decision is really up to Secretary of Agriculture Brooke Rollins, whose agency runs the food-stamp program, and she made similar comments at a press conference earlier this month. When I asked the Department of Agriculture for more details about the planned changes, a spokesperson directed me to a proposal released in draft form last fall. Under those new rules, stores would be required to carry seven varieties of food across four categories: protein, dairy, grains, and vegetables and fruits.

The move could put us one step closer to healthy convenience stores, which have long been a dream of some nutrition reformers. Several experiments in different cities—including in Baltimore, New Orleans, and Denver—have tried to alleviate the problem of food deserts by improving the offerings at local mini-marts. A review of these pilot programs found “consistent improvements across most of the trials in the availability and sale of healthy foods, the purchase and consumption of those foods, and consumer knowledge.”

But the Trump administration’s plan isn’t perfect. Under the draft proposal, corner stores won’t have to follow any specific nutritional guidelines, so long as they meet the food-group standards. The Center for Science in the Public Interest, a consumer-advocacy group, has warned that the new standards mean that stores could stock Fruity Pebbles to fulfill the grain requirement, and sugary canned peaches for the fruit requirement. “It would be very easy for a retailer to meet the proposed rule by stocking foods in each staple food category that are high in added sugar, sodium, saturated fat, and refined grains,” Joelle Johnson, the deputy director of CSPI, told me.

Read: Why don’t convenience stores sell better food?

Changing mini-marts for good won’t be easy. Owners stock their stores based on what sells, and available data suggest that “real food” isn’t exactly driving sales. A recent analysis by Lula Commerce, an online-shopping tool for convenience stores, found that alcohol, soda, and energy drinks were the top items ordered by their stores’ customers. And a 2021 report by the National Association of Convenience Stores pointed to packaged beverages, cigarettes, and salty snacks as among the best sellers. Convenience stores are concerned that stocking healthy products will just mean wasted shelf space in their already crowded stores. They typically don’t have the margins necessary to swap out a section of the drink cooler to stock cauliflower or salmon filets, especially when these products may rot. NACS supports aspects of the Trump administration’s push to heighten the requirements for what these stores have to stock, Margaret Hardin Mannion, the group’s director of government relations, told me. But, she added, “we have to be able to sell what our customers want to buy.” Though the Trump administration is within its power to mandate that convenience stores participating in the food-stamps program stock as many healthy goods as it deems fit, that could easily backfire if retailers back out of the program entirely.

Until convenience stores actually give customers the option to buy strawberries instead of Slim Jims, it’s hard to know exactly how well-founded their fears really are. The smattering of experiments that stocked mini-marts with fresh produce suggest that people do have some interest in eating healthier when they can. But many of these trials also included efforts meant specifically to drum up sales of healthy items. In one experiment in Baltimore, convenience stores were encouraged to stock certain healthy foods through subsidies from researchers. Retailers hung up posters to promote these new healthy foods, and some gave out coupons to encourage specific purchases. Replicating an experiment like this on the national scale would cost some major cash. (There are more than 150,000 convenience stores in the United States.) And it would require a real leap of faith from an administration that to date has focused much of its efforts on restricting the products that can be purchased with food stamps, and on rooting out alleged fraud within the program.

For now, RFK Jr. and other health officials are stuck with a convenience-store conundrum. The mini-mart embodies how hard it is to actually improve the American diet. It’s enough of a challenge to get stores to stock their shelves with broccoli. But that still isn’t a guarantee that people will put down the Doritos.</div>

On this week’s episode of The David Frum Show, David opens with his reflections on the recent shootings in Minneapolis. He argues that these killings, alongside ICE’s warrantless home raids and mistaken detentions, and the reports of deaths in custody, are not isolated abuses but signs of a rapidly deepening crisis in American democracy, one in which basic rights and due process are applied unevenly and increasingly contested. David asks whether the country can find a way back from a dangerous moral and political impasse, as a majority of Americans recoil from these actions while a determined minority continue to defend them.

Then, David is joined by the New York Times columnist and Atlantic contributor David Brooks. Frum and Brooks discuss the origins of the term neocon, what the neocons got right, and why they should be listened to today. Brooks describes how America’s problems long predate Trump, and why elections alone cannot fix what has been lost. Together, Frum and Brooks explore whether the country is capable of moral renewal, what rebuilding would actually require, and why recovery, if it comes at all, will be slow, difficult, and deeply personal.

Finally, David ends the episode with his thoughts on Death by Lightning, a television series on Netflix based on the assassination of President James Garfield, and how, when watching historical dramas, we need to look back on the past with a contextual lens, one that we should bring to our present too.

The following is a transcript of the episode:

David Frum: Hello, and welcome to The David Frum Show. I’m David Frum, a staff writer at The Atlantic. If you have listened to or watched this program before, you will notice that this present opening looks and sounds a little different from usual. Let me hasten to assure you that most of the show will look as normal. There will be a dialogue between me and David Brooks, columnist at The New York Times and contributor to The Atlantic; that will look and sound normal. And we will conclude with a discussion of the new four-part Netflix miniseries Death by Lightning, a dramatization based on the assassination of President [James] Garfield; that will look and sound like normal. But this opening will not, and does not, look and sound like normal, and I have to beg your pardon for that.

Here’s my excuse. I planned a family vacation in South America for the final two weeks in January. I prerecorded the dialogue and the book talk and also the opening monologue because I thought, What crazy things can possibly happen in the last two weeks of January? Well, you know as well as I what crazy things have happened in the last two weeks of January: NATO allies like France and Britain, Denmark and Norway moving troops into Greenland. An altercation at Davos between the president of the United States and the prime minister of Canada that concluded, or has yielded. Members of the Trump Cabinet now promoting the secession of the Canadian province of Alberta to retaliate and threatening Canada with all kinds of massive tariffs to punish Canada for its prime minister getting too much attention at Davos. President [Donald] Trump making it clear that everything he’s been doing in foreign policy is motivated by his thwarted desire for a Nobel Peace Prize. And of course, and above all, the terrible events in the city of Minneapolis, where a second American citizen has been killed by agents purportedly enforcing the law while that American citizen was, according to most, if not all, video evidence presenting no danger to anybody, least of all officers of the law. And the terrible, systematic lying that has surrounded each of these terrible incidents, with their attacks on basic norms of American rights and process.

It’s not just the American citizens who have been killed that are a scandal that shocks the nation coming from Minneapolis; forces of the law have burst into private homes without a warrant, have seized people—the wrong people—hauled them out into the streets in their underwear in a Minnesota January. We are hearing reports of deaths in detention, people being reportedly killed in detention. This is all on top of the previous cases of people being sent by American immigration authorities to torture centers in third countries, centers that have been closed down by American courts because they violate basic norms of due process, and American civil rights and civil liberties. It’s a shocking, shocking story.

And even as I record, in the final week of January, it is amazing how much of this story remains murky and mysterious. An American citizen has been killed. We don’t know the names of his killer. We don’t know whether the killer has been removed from the streets of Minneapolis. The representatives of the state of Minnesota have been debarred from investigating what happened, how this terrible event could have unfolded in the way that it did. A man has been shot in the back when he was disarmed, while he was being beaten—in a beating we all saw on camera—for the apparent offense of recording the activities of law enforcement and personnel, which was his total personal right to do, while carrying a gun, which was his right to do. I’m someone who’s pretty skeptical of the way American gun rights have unfolded, but skepticism does not mean that, if you carry a gun according to the law of your state, that that gives the agents of the state power or right to seize you, force you to the ground, remove the gun from you, beat you, and then shoot you in the back, reportedly 10 times. Something has gone terribly, terribly wrong, and it’s getting wronger.

Now, the good news is that a substantial majority of American citizens object to this wrong and oppose it, and that majority seems to be growing. The bad news is, is that an important minority continue to defend these actions, and are rallying to the support of the personnel who commit these acts and the larger structures of permission that authorize and enabled and defend these acts.

This a country that is now split on the basic question, “Can an American citizen be gunned down on the streets of his own city while carrying in his hands nothing more dangerous than a cellphone?” Opinion is split.

David Brooks and I, in our dialogue, will talk a little bit about how, someday, the MAGA forces, the people who supported MAGA, may be reintegrated into the American family, into American democracy. David Brooks advocates a very open-armed and forgiving approach; I’m not so sure that he’s right about that. But that is something that we’ll discuss, and you will form your own opinion after hearing our discussion.

For now, we have the problem that the people who are carrying out these acts, against the wishes of the great majority of Americans, with the support of a minority of Americans, they remain in power. Now, I think we all know MAGA people and we all know that, most people who supported Donald Trump, or many of the people who supported Donald Trump, did not begin as bad people, but they are justifying bad things—and things that are getting worse and worse and worse at an accelerating rate. It is sobering to consider, if this is what has happened in year one of the Trump administration, as Trump and his people come closer to whatever kind of reckoning is available in November of 2026, what will the year ahead look like? What does 2026 hold? It looks like it will hold more abuses, more offenses, more attacks, more contempt for basic American values and law. And we all have to find our way to come up with some kind of effective collective response.

We appear to be heading to a government shutdown, as Democrats in the Senate say they will not vote to fund ICE if it continues the kind of operations it’s been doing. This may be quite a long government shutdown because there’s going to be a lot at stake for everybody involved.

But we are facing a kind of crisis in American democracy that is worse than anything that even people who were really worried about it, as I was, predicted a year ago, never mind at the very beginning of the Trump experiment in 2016, 2017, 2015, when Trump declared for office. We’ve been kind of walking a path to moral degradation, and we’re trying to stay away from the finale of moral ruin.

I don’t know what’s ahead. I’m terribly worried. I hope we find a way out together, that there can become some kind of collective American agreement on what it means to hold the rights that American citizens should hold, on what it means that American citizens are being gunned down in the streets of their cities—on the sidewalk, in their cars. That American citizens, naturalized citizens, but American as anybody else, are being hauled from their houses without a warrant, and that important people in American government insist that there no warrant is due because the provisions of 1776, which listed abuses of the search power as one of the causes of separation of the United States from Great Britain, that those principles no longer apply, at least they don’t apply to Americans of certain kinds of last names, and certain kind of accents, and certain kinds of backgrounds and personal stories, and certain kind of skin colors—that other Americans have got them. that MAGA people carry guns at their events and, of course, don’t expect to be executed for it, but other Americans don’t have those rights; MAGA people expect to be served with warrants in their homes if someone needs to search their homes for something, but other people don’t have those rights. They don’t extend to others the rights they claim for themselves.

How will we find a way from this impasse? Well, David and I will talk about it, and I hope you will stick around to watch a more normal-looking version of this program.

Frum: David Brooks is a contributing editor at The Atlantic. Oh, he’s also one of the most popular writers and speakers in the entire English-speaking world, with a career that spans many decades at every distinguished institution. I was a colleague of his at The Weekly Standard in the 1990s. But you probably know him from his role at The New York Times as one of the most influential newspaper columnists in America for more than two decades, from his appearances on PBS and NPR, or you may have seen one of his innumerable appearances on public platforms, where he delights audiences in every state of this country and every country of the world, it seems. He is an indefatigable writer. He is the author of more books than I can even tally, all of which have gone on to enormous success. Most recently is the 2023 book How to Know a Person: The Art of Seeing Others Deeply and Being Deeply Seen. And I’m just so grateful he has taken time away from his whirligig of activities to join me today on The David Frum Show.

David Brooks: I think we were actually colleagues at The Wall Street Journal first, before The Weekly Standard, back in the ’80s—

Frum: —that’s true. That’s true. And you went off to glory at The Wall Street Journal Europe, where you covered the ’89 uprisings, terrifying your grandmother. You had a wonderful line—I remember this—that she called you in Brussels and said, But, David, what if the revolution spreads?

Brooks: (Laughs.) True, and sure enough, it did.

Frum: (Laughs.) I wanna talk to you about your recent article for The Atlantic that appeared online in December and then in the print edition in January, called “The Neocons Were Right.” I think a lot of people are used to hearing this term used as a kind of shorthand in politics or conspiracy theory, but maybe some of us don’t know exactly what the term means. So could you explain what a neoconservative is, or was, and why it mattered once upon a time and now?

Brooks: Yeah. When people hear these days neocon, they think of the Iraq War, and they think of Republicans who supported the Iraq War. But neoconservatism, actually, it has its roots in a dining hall, a college dining hall.

The City College of New York was a school, or still is a school mostly for immigrant kids—in those days, I think no tuition; now very low tuition. So if you’ve just come to America and you wanna make it, City College is a great place to go. And in the 1930s, there were a group of young, mostly Jewish kids who were communists. And they had names like Nathan Glazer and Seymour Martin Lipset and Irving Kristol. And they were a certain kind of communist; they were Trotskyites. And the Trotskyites were the smart communists, basically. (Laughs.) And there were another kind called the Stalinists, and they were sort of the dumb conformists, to be honest. And in the dining hall, the Trotskyites, like Kristol and Nathan Glazer, ate in Alcove 1, a little part of the dining hall, and the Stalinists ate in Alcove 2. And the Trotskyites were so much better at beating the Stalinists in argument, the Stalinists, in true Stalinist fashion, forbade their members from debating with the Trotskyites.

And so they were communists in the ’30s. And then along comes the war; a bunch of the neocons, like Irving Kristol, served in World War II. And they realized communism was not gonna work. And so they became disillusioned with that. And then they became pretty standard Franklin Roosevelt Democrats. And some, like Nathan Glazer, went to work for John F. Kennedy. And in the early ’60s, there was great faith in social science. Politics didn’t have to be this big, messy ideological thing; we could just sic a lot of economists at a problem, and they would devise a rational, technocratic solution. And Irving Kristol and another, vaguely, person called neoconservative, Daniel Patrick Moynihan, formed a magazine called The Public Interest, and in the very first issue, Moynihan said, We’ve learned how to make a society work. And they were just standard-issue Democrats.

And then along comes 1968, ’69, a lot of the policies that they had so earnestly championed in the early ’60s were not working. American cities went into decay, rising crime rates, rising divorce rates, more kids born out of wedlock. There was just a lot of social anarchy. I was a kid in New York City in the 1970s, and everybody got mugged. The crime rates were incredible. There was a serial castrator on the Upper West Side who would take kids, lead ’m into Central Park, castrate them, and then murder them. And his nickname was Charlie Chop-Off. (Laughs.) And the crime was so bad in those days, Charlie Chop-Off was not even a big story. (Laughs.) But so there was so much social decay, and so the neocons, the people we now call neocons, said, Whoa, all the social planning that we had such faith in 10 years ago, we were wrong. Like, Well, the world’s a lot more complicated than we thought. And as Irving Kristol famously put it, a neoconservative is “a liberal who’s been mugged by reality.”

And the second thing that happened in the 1960s was a group of—these immigrant kids believed in the bourgeois values: Work hard. Dress neatly. Respect your parents. Along came these rich hippies, saying, Don’t work hard. Drop out. Do drugs. And they were outraged; they were just morally offended.

And so that’s really the roots of neoconservatism. It’s not some right-wing Republican thing; it started as a strategy of dissent within the Democratic Party.

Frum: Okay, but the distance in time from the 1960s to us is the same as the distance in time from when these people were young, in the 1930s, to Reconstruction.

Frum: (Laughs.) Did I just do that math right? Yeah, it’s, like, 60 years. So why would you write a magazine article in 2026 saying these people who were active from 1930-something to 1960-something were right about anything to do with us? How does this bear on our lives today in any way?

Brooks: Because I’m a human anachronism. That’s why.

Frum: (Laughs.) No, no, you have your finger on the pulse. We count on your observations to tell us what’s going on in America, so what’s going on in America that any of this helps us with?

Brooks: I think what the neoconservatives can do is they teach us, first of all, some of the things they learned in the ’60s: Life is really complicated. You should do social policy. You should try to improve government, but you should realize that most policies fail, and you should really have good reasons, and you should make it bureaucratic. But I think the core insight for the neocons—they not only grew up as policy people; they were influenced by literature, by culture, by theology, by Talmudic study. And so they made no distinction between what you would call theological, philosophical, cultural growth—moral formation—and policy. And so they brought a much more humanistic lens to see policy; it’s not just about economics and growth. [The] elemental question is (a) can we build a civilization we can be proud of, and (b) can we create policies that will nurture values, the right kind of values?

In 1985, one of the great neoconservative political scientists, a guy named James Q. Wilson, who spent much of his career at Harvard, said, All we’re trying to do is trying to inculcate certain virtues, whether we’re talking about education, when we’re talking about trying to reduce recidivism, when we’re trying to talk about conducting our fiscal policy. And we can either have good values, and for the neoconservatives, the good values were the bourgeois values—being decent to people, being neighborly, showing up on time, working hard—not lofty Kantian values, or we can have bad values. And if we run deficits, we’re basically behaving selfishly to future generations. If we subsidize nonwork, then we will discourage people from becoming industrious and that kind of person. And so I think one of the things they do—and especially in a moment right now, when we’re in a myriad of really moral [crises] in our politics, where basically 78 million Americans take a look at Donald Trump and they see nothing morally wrong.

Frum: Okay, so we are at a moment—I was wondering where you were going to go—we’re at a moment when agencies of government, Cabinet-level departments, are, for their own amusement, tweeting out variations that are obviously intended to be variations on Nazi Party slogans: “One people, one empire, one leader”; when we have masked armed men roaming American cities, detaining people without any right to detain them, beating up people, in some cases killing them. We have the most corrupt administration—not in American history, but I keep saying, if this were a Nigerian administration, it would be one of the most corrupt administrations in Nigerian history—to your point about bourgeois values, where the president of the United States was a close friend to, and seems to be operating a cover-up on behalf of, one of the most notorious child-molestation rings (Laughs.) in American history. And how is Irving Kristol going to help us with any of this?

Brooks: (Laughs.) Well, (a) ’cause he reminds us—and especially his wife, Gertrude Himmelfarb, the historian—he reminds us the power of the spirit of an age, that we live within a moral ecology tnd that moral ecology is not only constructed by each of us in our own behaviors, but it’s constructed by the arts, by literature, and by the example set by great political leaders.

This is Gertrude Himmelfarb, the great historian of Victorian England—in 1810, it was completely normal for a guy to get drunk after work, go home, and beat his wife. There was no harsh judgment about that; that’s just the way things are. And along came a group called the Clapham Sect, who were basically evangelicals, and they said, No, that is not gonna be acceptable behavior anymore. So they reset the norms of what acceptable behavior was going to be. They’re sort of the beginnings of Victorian morality. And as part of that, they said, We have such respect for human dignity, we’re gonna campaign against the slave trade. And so what Himmelfarb describes is a period of moral improvement for a whole society. We all live on the cultural capital of centuries gone by, and if we tear away at that capital, then we’re lost in the world Stephen Miller talked about last week, which is a war of all against all, where force is the only thing that matters; a shared morality does not matter.

And so I think they give us the tools to think about, How do we reconstruct a social order so we can trust one another once again and so we can treat each other decently once again?

Frum: Many of the people that you and I knew when we were young have gone on to power and prominence, and they started off sharing many of the ideas, or at least participating in many of the ideas that you’re describing. And today, we have a world in which the bright lights of the younger intellectual right are inspired at best, at best, by the idea of abolishing the difference between church and state and letting the church run everything, and at worst by outright fascism, and at very worst by flirtations with literal Nazism. So, that’s what’s happened to the conservative world in which we’ve moved. And the result is that people of conservative instinct, which I still consider myself to be and I think you may as well, find ourselves mute and voiceless when we hear things from people on the more liberal, or left, side of the spectrum, saying, Well, they have some things we don’t like, but what do we have to set against this when the choices really do seem to be wokeism or fascism? (Laughs.) How is Irving Kristol going to help us with our dilemma? If I have to choose, I’m choosing wokeism over fascism, but I’m not crazy about either.

Brooks: Yeah, you’re really cheering me up. So glad I came on the podcast. No, I’m kidding. (Laughs.) You and I—

Frum: (Laughs.) No concessions—speaking of, like, the neoconservative spirit—no concessions to the need for uplift here. We’re going for the full gloom-and-doom situation.

Brooks: (Laughs.) So you and I got out of school at about the same time and entered our business at the same time. And at that time, I was working at National Review in the mid-’80s, and another group of people came out of school at the same time. And I came out of the University of Chicago; you came out of a fancier school back east. But there were a group of students from Dartmouth—

Frum: I think you meant easier school, but you’re being polite.

Brooks: So there were a group from Dartmouth who worked at a magazine called The Dartmouth Review, and people will know some of them still: Laura Ingraham, Dinesh D’Souza. There was a guy named Ben Hart. There was a guy named Greg Fossedal. And I did not appreciate the distinction; I thought we were all on the same team. But there was a distinction—I think earnest people like me and you, we were pro-conservative. We had read Edmund Burke and Isaiah Berlin and Adam Smith, and we had these earnest ideas that was pro-a conservative vision of society. But Dinesh D’Souza and Laura Ingraham, they were not pro-conservative; they were anti-left.

And there was an episode that illustrates for me how they were different from us: that during the ’80s, to protest apartheid, students on a lot of campuses put up shantytowns, and it was to represent the suffering of Black citizens of South Africa under apartheid. And one night, a bunch of the editors of The Dartmouth Review descended on the shantytown protests and, with sledgehammers, slammed them down. And I remember being appalled, (a) because apartheid really was evil and was worth opposing, but (b) going through a protest with sledgehammers and destroying it, that’s not America; that’s [Joseph] Goebbels. That is really thuggish fascism. And I thought they were low-rent; I thought those people were intellectually mediocre. But it turns out there were a lot more people who were anti-left than there were pro-conservative, especially as the time went [by].

And so what you have in the Trump administration is people with the same profile as the Dartmouth Review crowd: They went to elite schools, but they hated what they found there. That’s Steven Miller, who went to Duke. That’s Pete Hegseth, who went to Princeton. That’s J. D. Vance, who went to Yale Law. Now, you can go down the list. It’s Elon Musk and Donald Trump went to Penn. And so these are not pro-conservative. These are oppositional nihilists who hate the liberal establishment. And I found it easy, when I was saying college, to be more conservative than my professors but still have reverence for their learning. But these people do not have reverence for learning; they just want to offend the bourgeoisie. And so that’s what it’s become. And then they’ve produced spawn of young people who just think, That’s cool. That’s edgy. And of course, you have to up the dosage when you’re giving people edgy nihilism—it just has to get worse and worse and worse. And as Richard Weaver, a philosopher from the 1950s, said, The problem with the younger generation is they haven’t read the minutes to the last meeting. And so you get a group of people who, when they see fascistic behavior, don’t understand where that eventually leads.

Frum: When you set out the stage for us, you described events or thinkers or currents that were active between the 1930s and the 1960s. How does any of this get attached to the Iraq War all those years later?

Brooks: Well, I think it got attached—and I’ll tell my story—I think what happened was, neoconservatives, as I said, really believe in the nature of a regime. They want America to stand for certain values, and they’re appalled by regimes that stand for evil values. And the Soviet Union was like that, and Saddam Hussein’s Iraq was like that. And so they said, If you have a regime that is internally and domestically poisonous and oppressive, it will be dangerous to the world. And I would say, in my life in the ’90s, I was covering the end of apartheid, the end of the Soviet Union, the reunification of Germany, the Oslo peace process in the Middle East. I was watching democracy be created, and it seemed to me we were on a tidal wave of creating societies with better democratic values. And so I think a lot of neocons like me or others and our elders supported the Iraq War for that reason: because they thought fighting for a democratic wave was the right thing to do.

What they did not sufficiently appreciate, what we, and especially me, did not sufficiently—the other thing I had said earlier about neocons: epistemological modesty. Be careful about trying to change complex circumstances, ’cause you’re gonna screw it up. And we ignored one of the core tenets of our own belief system; we were so swept up in the moment. And if we’d only gone back to the single most famous neoconservative foreign-policy essay of all time, was written by Jeane Kirkpatrick, and her argument was that if you’re gonna try to a democracy in an authoritarian context, you need generations of civic planning, of civic organization, of moral foundations of a democracy. You can’t just imagine you can do it overnight. And we forgot that lesson.

Frum: Mm. Well, we are, in many ways, living in the 2020s in the Iraq hangover, that many people—people of good faith, people of bad faith—took the lesson from the Iraq experience to stay out of everything. And so we’ve had a decade and a half where America has largely been absent from many of the great decisions of the time. And in the Obama administration, [President Barack] Obama backed away from the Syrian civil war, a war that looks more and more important the farther we get from it. He laid down some red lines, and he said he would enforce them, and he had, certainly, I think, abundant authority on his own to do it, but the moment Congress raised any objection, he backed away and then said, Okay, well, it’s because of Congress. My hands are tied. I’m powerless to intervene. And so you got this extraordinary wave of refugees from Syria—I forget the number of how many millions of people. Half the population of Syria was internally displaced; millions left. Millions of other people from other places moved at the same time and destabilized the politics of Europe and the whole world.

The United States was quite passive when the Russians invaded Crimea in 2014, and the Trump years are their own story. And now we see people in the streets of Iranian cities chanting, looking for American help, and we are in a country where people no longer feel that there is a right, a calling, or any likelihood of success in America intervening in these important conflicts. And the world is on its own now, without American guidance, at the mercy of whoever looks like the second-strongest candidate to guide the world.

Brooks: Yeah, when we withdrew, our friend Robert Kagan wrote a book called The Jungle Grows Back, which is to say, when there’s no social order holding the world, then the wolves take over. And wolves like [Russian President Vladimir] Putin and [Chinese President] Xi [Jinping] and others have taken over. And people [in] this country on the populist right and sometimes on the left think, Oh, that old neoliberal order, that was all a scam. It was a scam for America to exercise imperial hegemony, but it was all just words. But that liberal world order that people built after World War II, and that people like Ronald Reagan and John F. Kennedy and Harry Truman enforced, that really did restrain people. And so the world has just become a more dangerous place. And America has taken one of our great assets, which is our ideals—I’ve covered so many people around the world, and they want democracy; they want dignity—and we have squandered that strength. It’s an actual source of strength. And then the final thing, we replaced it now with Donald Trump. We’re no longer hanging back. Suddenly, we’re launching forever wars all the hell all over the place, but we’re not doing it on behalf of ideals; we’re doing it on behalf of nihilism, on behalf of oil. I feel sorry for all my left-wing friends, who used to—and when they talked about George W. Bush, they would say, He claims to be for democracy, but really, this war is all about oil. And they had the subtle ways to see what the real meaning of what Bush was saying was. But that skill’s no longer necessary because Donald Trump says, Yeah, it’s all about oil. What are you gonna do about it?

And so I would ask people, “If you thought American foreign-policy idealism was discredited by Iraq, which it largely was, how do you like the anti-idealistic foreign policy, a policy of pure material greed?”

Frum: Let’s go back to these old books and essays, and think about, What are the lessons that, in the age of Trumpism, we need, whether we are broadly sympathetic to conservative projects or if we’re broadly unsympathetic. Let’s start with the other side. If you’re someone who’s not a conservative and you think of yourself as a liberal or even a progressive, is there any value in any of these old ideas in the face of an administration, as I said, where at best we’re looking at people who wanna overthrow the separation of church and state, with the church in charge, and at worst functional fascists and on the edge outright Nazi sympathizers and apologists? Why isn’t the lesson for a person of liberal views or progressive views to say, You know what? Conservatism was always a terrible idea. I never liked any of these folks. They’re now even worse than before. I have nothing to learn from any of them?

Brooks: Well, a lot of my more progressive friends are always nostalgic for the last conservatives. And so I started saying, Well, wait ’til we have a Republican government that makes you nostalgic for Donald Trump. (Laughs.) So that seems to be the trend.

I would say there are certain things that are not liberal or conservative. They used to be consensus American positions. One is that we have a social order, that there are certain rules and certain beliefs and values that we share, that form the basis of how we live. George Marsden is a great historian, and he wrote this about Martin Luther King [Jr.]’s rhetoric: He says, What gave King’s rhetoric such force is the idea that right and wrong are written into the fabric of the universe. That slavery is not just wrong in some times and some places; it’s always wrong. Segregation is not just wrong in some times and some places; it is always wrong. Right and wrong are written into the fabric of the universe. And when you have that social order, people feel held. You can have a society ’cause we have a shared understanding of what’s right and wrong. We have a shared sense of norms about what’s right and wrong, so we’re gonna behave [with] each other; we can trust each other. Two generations ago, 60 percent of Americans said, Yeah, my neighbors are trustworthy. That’s not a liberal or a conservative thing; that was a great human achievement. And what happened? We shredded the shared moral order. And that was not just a conservative project; it was a liberal project too.

And so one of the things we did is we privatized morality. We said to people, Come up with your own values. And the problem with that is that there’s no shared morality if everyone has to come up with their own values. And the other problem with that is, unless your name is Aristotle, you can’t come up with values. Walter Lippmann, a great columnist in the 1950s, wrote a book in which he said, If what is right and wrong is based on what each individual feels according to their emotions, then we are outside the bounds of civilization. And so this moral collapse, I think, is what undergirds the rise of Trump. It undergirds the alienation. It undergirds the idea that we want a politics that’s based not on ideals and values, that it’s about power and it’s about who has more force. And so if we’re gonna get over Trumpism or the [Alternative for Democracy] AfFD or [French politician Marine] Le Pen, we need a set of ideals that can hold society together and create some social trust, and we need ideals that have some roots—and this is what the New York conservatives were good about—in universal values. It’s not just my kind. All through much of human history, my kind of people are the kind of people I care about, and I don’t care about the other kind. But it was a great achievement of civilization to say, No, I care about all people, maybe not all equally, but there are certain ideas that apply to everybody, ideas of dignity, democracy, and kindness. And that was an achievement.

And so I think the neoconservatives were inheritors, maybe more conservative than not, some not, but they were the inheritors of that idea, and they caused us to see politics and see our national culture through the lens of either a shared moral order or a lack of one.

Frum: I am, like you, formed in many ways by this tradition. I’ve got some critical distance from it. I never really felt like I was a part—I read the books; I never felt like I was part of the social circle that was such an important aspect of the neoconservative world when it was a real thing. So I knew these things through print rather than through personality. And in a way, that was kind of disqualifying because neoconservatism was as much a milieu as it was a set of ideas, and I was not a member of that milieu. Maybe I’m just anti-social. But the question I think about a lot as we are trying to move beyond Trumpism is it does seem like there’s about to be a big swing of political power in the United States in ’26 and ’28. I worried through the year 2025 that Trump would somehow be able to distort the election enough to hold on to power, the coming congressional election. I think the tide against him is now too big for those methods to work. Unless he tries an outright coup d&#39;état, I don’t know how he stops it.

So there’s likely to be a shift in power. And the question I find myself thinking about a lot—and I have no answer to this, and I’d be very interested to be guided by the wisdom you draw from these texts and your own wisdom. When President [Joe] Biden entered office in 2021, clearly, his thought, or clearly to me, his thought was, We need to get past the recent unpleasantness. We need a policy of accommodation. We need a policy of looking forward, not backward. And while, when people have actually sacked the Capitol, they have to be held to account, we’re not gonna object too much if their higher-ups—a justice system goes real, real slow on bringing justice to the people who gave the orders for the sacking on January 6, 2021. We’ll punish the actual foot soldiers, but we’ll leave the colonels and generals alone mostly, to the extent we can. The question I am struggling with is: If and when power does shift, was the Biden attitude the right one, to be reapplied in ’27 and ’29, or do we need some kind of lustration, something like what the Czechs and Hungarians and Poles did after 1989? They said, Look, we have an elite that was authoritarian, corrupt, and criminal, in some cases homicidal. And we can’t do justice in every case, but we need to find some system to hold the previous administration to a moral and legal account, and exclude them from power. I can’t make up my mind what’s the right answer. What guidance would you draw from these old texts?

Brooks: Yeah, I guess I would not be for mass defenestrations.

Frum: I’m not throwing them out the window.

Frum: No, I’m serious. What should happen—Jeanine Pirro, a U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia who’s leading the charge to bring these utterly ridiculous criminal charges against the head of the Federal Reserve to destroy the independence of the Federal Reserve and subordinate monetary policy to Trump’s election needs. What should happen to her?

Brooks: Yeah. So first, I think the problem with the Biden administration, one of them, was that he said, correctly, “This is a battle for the soul of America”; he had no idea how to think about that. And then he should have read more neoconservative books ’cause they would have said, Here’s the soul of America. Here’s how it’s being destroyed. [Here’s] how you can restore it.

The second thing, and one of the reasons I’m not against going after these people as aggressively—when they broke the law, if they break the law, they should break the law. George Santayana, the philosopher, said that Americans don’t solve problems; they just leave them behind. And I think what’s gonna happen after Trump is that people are gonna take a look at corruption in Washington on an unprecedented scale, and they’re gonna wanna do what Americans did after Watergate: They’re gonna wanna turn the page. And in 1976, Jimmy Carter looked like integrity. And so it’s not like—and I actually think Gerald Ford did the right thing in pardoning Richard Nixon because we didn’t need to wage the same war over and over again. I thought the indictments of Trump during the Biden administration ended up helping Trump get reelected. And so I worry that that will happen again or that will just motivate the same battle lines over and over again.

Voters who voted for him, they have real issues, real concerns, which Trump is not addressing. The job is to win them over, not to lock them in the same battle lines as before. I think societies move forward the same way human beings move forward: through a process of rupture and repair. Trump has ruptured our society from top to bottom, and I think you just move on, you turn the page, and you offer something different. After Nixon, you got something different in Carter. After Carter, you got something different in Reagan. After Reagan–[George H.W.] Bush, you got something different in [President Bill] Clinton. And people want to try something different.

Frum: You make a very compelling case, and as so often, you’re almost certainly right. But let me just keep thinking.

One of the teachings of the neoconservative world was that these moral beliefs matter, that culture matters. And they were very impatient with social scientists who said, No, what matters are deep structures of wealth and power. They didn’t like that way of thinking. But deep structures of wealth and power do often matter. And so after Trump leaves office, it will still be true that the people who became corrupt billionaires under Trump will remain corrupt billionaires, with all the political power that that entails—including, by the way, Trump’s children, who have made a corrupt fortune in the single year of his first year of his presidency through these cryptocurrency operations they’re running, which have left every purchaser losing 95 percent of their money but have left the sellers very rich. That is not just wealth; that’s power.

The changes in the media landscape that have concentrated informational power in the hands of people who are beholden to the Trump administration, whether it’s the social-media companies or the new conglomerates in what we used to call television—I don’t know what we’ll call it [as we] go on—those will still remain. The changes that have happened inside the Republican Party, those will remain. People talk about doing something about these ICE recruits, but they’re still going to remain, probably, government employees with this rogue police force that doesn’t seem to answer to any kind of—that’s all going to be there.

And how do you say, Well, we’re going to re-moralize the society, when the structures of wealth and power bequeathed by what used to be there, where those structures are all still there, just waiting for the next economic downturn to take power? That’s what happened to Biden: He just assumed, Well, we can re-moralize society, he thought and forgot, well, if there’s a little bit of inflation in ’22 and ’23, all of this changes, and everything that was sinister before reemerges from the surface of the waters to claim new victims.

Brooks: Yeah, there’s clearly a lot of weight behind your argument. I think we all acknowledge that it was a big mistake not to punish any of the 2008 financial-crisis architects. That just struck people as a moral job undone. So sometimes you do have to have truth and reconciliation, with the emphasis on truth.

On the other hand, I think the big test for people in the years ahead is to separate Trump voters, working-class voters, from the Trump cronies. And I think that will happen (a) as people are realizing that the Trump cronies ride to power on the votes of the working class. And the working class die much sooner. They earn much less. They’re much more likely to get divorced. They’re much more likely to say they have no friends. So the needs of the working class are really something that needs to be addressed, and Trump is not doing it. And the job is to separate those working-class voters from the cronies.

The Republican Party in our lifetime, in my view, is always gonna be a working-class party. That’s true of every right-wing party in the Western world. What used to be the bankers’ party is now a working-class party. And it is a great achievement to become a multiracial working-class party, if the Republicans can pull it off. And so we’re not going to go back to the Republican Party that you and I knew in 1990. It’s gonna be a working-class party.

Frum: What does that mean? What do you mean when you say it’s going to be a working-class party? My sense of the Trump vote in 2024 was that the Trump voter was more affluent, on average, than the [Kamala] Harris voter. And while Harris did better among college-educated people than Trump did, that Trump was competitive and that noncollege voters are not always the same thing as working-class voters. They may simply be older voters who finished their schooling at a time when education was less prevalent than it’s been since the 1970s.

Brooks: Yeah, there are obviously a lot of Trump billionaires floating around out there. But if you look at the upper-middle, educated sectors of our society—whether it’s Palo Alto; Bethesda, Maryland; Westchester County, New York; Boston—those are all Democratic areas. And to me, the best predictor of voting patterns is no longer income; it basically is not a predictor of voting patterns anymore. It’s education levels. And Democrats are winning over the highly educated former Republican suburbs, and Republicans are winning over the less-educated working class in rural areas. And I guess I use working class a little loosely; I really mean education levels.

And it’s simply, that’s the divide not only in this country, but across Western Europe. And why is it the divide? Because the Information Age economy rewards education with money. And a lot of people look around their societies, whether it’s here or in Hungary or in England and in France, and they see the 20 percent most-educated people living in extremely affluent lifestyles, sending their kids to the same schools, replicating a caste system based upon education and inherited privilege, and, by the way, ruling working-class and conservative voices out of the media and out of college campuses. And if you tell people that one top 20 percent is gonna rig the game generation after generation, they’re gonna flip the table. And that’s why populism is not only an American thing. This phenomenon is happening everywhere in the Western world as we screw up the need to respond to the nature of the Information Age economy.

And so, to me, the central challenge is to separate those people from MAGA. And I think [the way] that is most doable is if we try to put Trump in the rearview mirror.

Frum: Yeah, well, MAGA is doing a pretty good job of separating themselves. And the tariff policy, which is essentially a tax on purchases of goods, and the less you make, the more of your income is taken—it’s a nakedly, upwardly redistributive thing—you combine that with the other things they’re doing, not just the tax cuts, but the destruction of tax enforcement in ways that favor those who own businesses. So for the affluent self-employed, paying taxes becomes ever more optional. For the people who spend their income on goods, taxes become ever more baffling and mysterious, and are included in the prices of the things you buy. So that’s doing a separation. And I think that the way that the Trump people have chosen to do immigration enforcement is destroying the prospects of the Republican Party as a multiracial party. So that work is being done.

But we are going to be left with, yes, many of the disaffections you described, but also with a governing elite, on the conservative side of the spectrum, that really has tasted the benefits of jettisoning democratic norms, jettisoning democratic institutions, and using violence as a tool of power. Do they unlearn those ideas from mere political defeat, or does something more need to happen? What does Irving Kristol tell us about that?

Brooks: (Laughs.) He would talk about the circulation of elites, that you can circulate elites pretty quickly. And all the people who were the elites in the Republican Party under George W. Bush, they thought they were gonna be in every Republican administration going forward, but that didn’t happen because Trump and Heritage Foundation and all those people brought in a new elite. CPAC, when I was a young conservative, was considered the fringe of the fringe, and it became the mainstream.

This is not unusual in American history. The people who were the elite under John F. Kennedy and Harry Truman were no longer the elite under Gary Hart and Bill Clinton. They had an entire shift in elites. And so you can have a shift in elites. And I’m hopeful that there is a group on the Democratic Party that is now acting like an elite, and I mean that in a good way. They’re running universities, and they’re trying to be less crazy-left than they were. They’re running institutions that they’re trying to reform. Isaiah Berlin, who I mentioned, he had a phrase, I find myself on the rightward edge of the leftward tendency, and that’s where I find myself.

Frum: The analogy I should have chosen was not lustration after 1989; it’s Reconstruction. That’s the American analogy, where the traditional governing elite of one of the great parties of much of the country committed itself to something not just in the defense of slavery, but to slavery-plus, fortified and amplified by treason. And until that generation has spent its 40 years in the wilderness, and a new generation has grown up, and the policies of the country have changed, and their victims have been brought into the political system—not just their disaffected followers, but also their victims—then you’re not going to have true stability again.

So I think, What are going to be the equivalents of the 13th, 14th, and 15th Amendments that go into place to make sure not just that we put Trumpism behind, but so it really can’t happen again. And so the people who got rich and powerful, and who will remain rich and powerful, don’t use that wealth and power to attack American institutions in the way that the Trump people did in the first year of the second term, and looks like we got three more years to go.

Brooks: Yeah, let me try a historical example on you. So in the 1920s and ’30s, we had vicious anti-immigration movements. We had the America Firsters, and we had Father [Charles] Coughlin, who was sort of a radio priest who had semi-fascist and anti-Semitic tendencies. And suddenly, along came Franklin Roosevelt, along came the Depression, along came World War II, and they were just discredited. And they were discredited from 1941 to probably 2006, at least. And they were discredited not by elites; they were discredited by the whole country. You did not wanna say the phrase “America First,” ’cause that would discredit you. And along comes Donald Trump, and when he first started saying the word “America First,” I was like, What is he doing? Everyone knows what “America First” is. (A) I’m not convinced he knew what the original “America First” was, (B) people had either no historical memory or they didn’t care, and so ideas that were discredited came back. And that is the nature of politics: It’s never over. No argument is ever settled. They come back. But, to me, it’s not what a certain set of prosecutors do. It’s whether the mass of America decides: That was despicable. That’s discredited. We don’t want any piece of that. And you can learn that lesson.

Frum: That history is not going to repeat itself, because it took the Great Depression to discredit high tariffs, it took the Holocaust to discredit anti-Semitism, and it took Pearl Harbor and then the subsequent American triumph in two oceans and the complete collapse of fascist ideas in the fascist countries and the repudiations by the fascist countries themselves of their previous fascism. (Laughs.) And that string of things is so dramatic, it’s very unlikely to repeat. So it’s much more likely to happen that the Trump people are going to have a bad election or two. There will be some of the more selfish, materialistic plutocrats who will say, You know [what]? We overdid some things. We overdid some things. We shouldn’t have shot that woman in Minneapolis. We shouldn’t have done the tariffs so much. And if you wanna get rich out of politics, you should just have the deferred gratification to wait until you’ve left office, and then we’ll make you rich. Don’t do it while you’re in office; that’s just impulsive. And maybe less denigration of women and other minorities. And also, by the way, leave the anti-Semitism for the podcasters; don’t bring it into public. So those may be the lessons. But otherwise, good job, everybody, because what we’ve learned is that the system is much more vulnerable than anybody thought it was to authoritarian means for plutocratic ends, and let’s just get smarter for the next try. That’s what I worry is going to be the outcome, not the kind of grand repudiation that you got because of the series of catastrophes of the 1930s and ’40s.

Brooks: Yeah, one of the things I think about and worry about is, I don’t think we’re ever going back to a pre-Trump presidency, which we had presidencies that were self-restrained, and they were strained by norms; they were strained by laws. But the presidents, I would interview them all, and I asked one president on his final day in office, What’d you learn being president that you didn’t know before? And he said, I learned there’s a lot of passive-aggressive behavior in government. The president says something, and nothing happens. And those were the restraints that were built into the system. Donald Trump has shown you can crash through all those restraints, both the legal and normative ones. And I have trouble believing any future president is gonna want to give back all that power, and so, whoever wins, we could be walking into an age where presidential power is ramped up and congressional power continues to deteriorate, which is a primary distortion of our system of government.

Frum: David, thank you so much for making time. Thank you for sharing all this wisdom and history. I learned a lot, and I’m sure every viewer and listener did too. We’re grateful to you. Thank you.

Brooks: It’s great to be extending our lifelong friendship.

Frum: Thanks so much to David Brooks for joining me today. Now, as I mentioned at the top of the program, my book this week is not a book at all; it’s a TV series, a four-part series on Netflix called Death by Lightning, about the presidency of James Garfield and his assassination at the hands of a killer named Charles Guiteau. It’s a delightful four-part series. I strongly recommend it. I enjoyed it enormously. Michael Shannon plays President Garfield. Matthew Macfadyen plays the assassin, Charles Guiteau. There’s both humor and heartbreak, and it’s really lovely. And I’m not here to be a total buzzkill about the series, just a little bit of one. There are some historical inaccuracies; I’m going to let them go. I’ll mention a couple of them.

When we first meet James Garfield, he’s working on his farm. He seems a man of the soil. You see someone far away from the dirty word of Washington politics, utterly surprised that he’s invited to speak at the Republican convention of 1880. You wouldn’t know from the opening of the series that he was, at that time, a ninth-term congressman who had just been elevated to the United States Senate (Laughs.) and whose main residence was a three-story townhouse at the corner of 13th and I in Washington, D.C. Okay, let that go.

Nor am I going to complain about the hilarious depiction of his vice president, Chester Arthur, as a thuggish boozer, although, actually, Chester Arthur was quite a gentle man and had been, in his day, a pretty serious scholar of Latin, Greek, and Hebrew. I think he was one of the stars of his class at Union College in upstate New York, and he was made Phi Beta Kappa.

So now, I’m not gonna quibble about those things. But what I am concerned about is this show introduces viewers who probably don’t know that much about it to an important period in American history, but at the price of deleting what made the period important, what the politics were about. It shows a lot of very personal quarrels, and many of these quarrels were indeed very personal, like the famous quarrel between Senators James Blaine and Roscoe Conkling, which was driven very much by ego and mutual dislike. So, yes, that’s all true, but it obscures, because it’s just too difficult to explain, what drove the politics of the period. And I wanna talk about that today because it confronts us with the tragic choices that people in the past have faced and helps us to maybe understand or have some patience for the tragic choices that we will face in our own time.

James Garfield was elected in 1880. He entered Congress during the Civil War. And in the post–Civil War period—and he retained a seat; he represented the northeastern part of Cleveland, near Lake Erie. The Civil War left behind two great issues to face for the traumatized country.

The first was what to do for and about the population of freed slaves, who had been subordinated, dehumanized, abused, who now were to be granted their freedom, but what did that freedom mean, and how was it to be made real? The 13th Amendment outlawed slavery. The 14th Amendment granted civil rights. The 15th Amendment granted voting rights. But those rights were often attacked by violence, by the neighbors of the freed slaves, and it was going to take a big military presence to continue to protect the slaves and their rights. What was to be done about that? How are they to be made full Americans? Should they be made full Americans? Should the rest of America undertake the costs and sacrifices necessary to make them full Americans? Problem one.

Problem two: Before the Civil War, the federal government of the United States was a very tiny and slapdash affair, but it didn’t matter because the federal government didn’t do much before the Civil War. During the Civil War, the United States had become the most powerful military force on planet Earth, and even after the demobilization, everyone saw the tremendous latent power of the United States, both military and economic. But the government, much bigger than before the Civil War, was still a scandal. Jobs were given by patronage. The government was financed by tariffs that were kind of random and crazy and punitive. And all of politics was about distributing government jobs to people who would help the government, whoever won the election—usually the Republican—to win. There was no rational administration. Levels of corruption were extremely high. This all had to be brought into the modern era. That was problem two.

The great tragic choice was the political coalition that supported justice for problem one—that is, bringing the freed slaves fully into national life—was a very different coalition from the coalition that might exist to pull the United States government into the modern era. And politicians of the time were forced to choose. The so-called Stalwarts, who were the group around Roscoe Conkling, who was one of the characters in the drama, said, Our job is to try to bring the freed slaves into national life. Now, that’s gonna mean some very dirty politics—because this is not a popular cause in the Northern part of the country, certainly not after about 1873; it loses all its popularity. The only way we’re going to keep winning elections is if we use the tariffs to raise a lot of money from protected industries; if we use patronage and pork barrel to get a lot of votes and persuade people to vote for us even though they don’t like very much the things we’re doing for the freed slaves, but they like what we’re doing for them; and, above all, avoid anything that smacks of reform. It’s the old flag, it’s the old cause, it’s a Republican Party based in the Protestant small towns of the North, and we remain very suspicious of the Democratic big cities and certainly suspicious of the South. That’s coalition one.

Coalition two said, No, we need to modernize. We need to bring some rationality to the tariff system. We need to suppress the post-war inflation with a new kind of monetary system and a new kind of banking system. We need to have a much more professional government. And that coalition means making inroads into the Democratic big cities of the North, and that means, of necessity, jettisoning concern for the freed slaves. And the people who took this approach to politics, unlike the Stalwarts, who took the first, they were known as the Half-Breeds. And a lot of the battle of the 1870s and 1880s are these battles between Stalwarts and Half-Breeds. Should you have a Reconstruction politics, or should you have a modernization politics?

I’ve simplified this enormously, and people who are versed in the period will detect many errors of nuance and emphasis in what I just said, but that’s basically the problem. And without telling people who are long dead (Laughs.) what they should have done, understanding that problem helps us to understand the period and it helps us to understand ourselves because their choices were ugly, and our choices are often ugly too, and political success goes to those who best manage the choice.

Garfield became president in 1880, and inaugurated in 1881, not because he was a hero—he had been a very great war hero; he’d behaved very gallantly at the Battle of Chickamauga especially. But he was not a political hero. He was a person who balanced and served political expediency. There’s a scene in the series that, when you put it into context, shows what Garfield was and what he wasn’t.

So there’s a scene in the series where Garfield is visited by men, African American men, in what appear to be Union uniforms, and they appear to be Union veterans. And he says to them, “And I tell you now, in the closing days of this campaign, that I would rather be with you and defeated than against you and victorious.” Well, that’s very inspiring. That’s very inspiring. Did it happen? So I pulled off my shelf the 1978 biography by Allan Peskin and looked up the incident. And sure enough, it did happen. And those words were spoken.

But something else (Laughs.) then happened. So the people to whom he spoke those words were not Union veterans. They were a group of singers from Fisk University, an all-Black college, who had come to serenade him, and he thanked them for the serenade, and he gave them a little speech afterwards. And he ended the speech by saying those words that the series quoted: “And I tell you now, in the closing days of this campaign, that I would rather be with you and defeated than against you and victorious.” But when the account was written up for the press by Garfield’s political team, that sentence was suppressed (Laughs.) according to his biographer. They left that out because that would cost votes. They did not wanna say to everybody—they wanted to say to the people who were there, We’ll be with you. But to everybody else, mm, maybe not. Garfield was a balancer, as political leaders so often are.

As I say, I’m not here to be Captain Buzzkill about this. I enjoyed the show; I hope you will too. But I do think we need to look back on the past with a tragic lens because we need to look at our present with a tragic lens. And understanding the past better helps us understand—and its problems, and the unsolvability and difficulty of its problems—gives us more sympathy and pity for the people who lived in the past and gives us more preparedness for our problems in the present.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Over the weekend, the basketball star Breanna Stewart didn’t have her normal bounce during player introductions. As soon as the announcer shouted her name, Stewart walked out holding a white sign with a message: Abolish ICE.

“I think that when human lives are at stake, it’s bigger than anything else,” Stewart said at a press conference following the game with Unrivaled, a three-on-three professional basketball league she co-founded in 2024.

Stewart’s declaration was daring because it was also personal. Her wife, Marta Xargay Casademont, was born in Spain and is in the United States on a green card. The couple is working on getting Casademont American citizenship, and Stewart criticizing ICE so publicly could jeopardize her chances.

During times of political and social turmoil, the public often looks to athletes to speak out against harmful policies and actions that are directed at marginalized communities. Doing so can be risky: The Trump administration has frequently attacked and mocked athletes who challenge the president, and many team owners are among Trump’s backers.

But it can be worthwhile. Historically, when athletes have chosen to speak out, their advocacy has helped effect real change. The often-cited example of how an athlete can shift the political discourse is the boxing icon Muhammad Ali’s refusal to be drafted into the Army in 1967 during the Vietnam War. In more recent times, we’ve seen stark examples of athletes changing the political dynamic with their involvement. As I wrote two years ago, in 2020 we saw athletes participating in the George Floyd protests and driving voter-registration campaigns. In Georgia, WNBA players banded together to help elect the state’s first Black senator, the Democrat Rapahel Warnock—despite the fact that his opponent, Kelly Loeffler, was a co-owner of the WNBA’s Atlanta Dream at the time. Loeffler drew players’ ire when she criticized them for supporting the Black Lives Matter movement. When Jacob Blake, a 29-year-old Black man, was shot seven times in the back by Kenosha, Wisconsin, police that August, professional games across five different sports were postponed.

Jemele Hill: What happened to the politically conscious Black athlete?

Since 2020, there’s been a notable decrease in athletes’ social and political engagement. But now, with recent events in Minnesota, that 2020 spirit seems to be tentatively flickering back to life. For instance, earlier this month, when a federal agent killed Renee Good,  the Milwaukee Bucks coach Doc Rivers called her death a “straight-up murder.”

The fatal shooting of Alex Pretti on Saturday seems to be pushing this dynamic further, and feels like an inflection point similar to the one created by Floyd’s death. At Sunday’s game between the Minnesota Timberwolves and the Golden State Warriors, a moment of silence was held, during which people in the crowd yelled “Fuck ICE!” (The game had previously been scheduled for Saturday and was postponed, the league said, “to prioritize the safety and security of the Minneapolis community.”) Every major professional sports team in Minnesota joined numerous businesses and corporations in signing a letter released by the Minnesota Chamber of Commerce calling for “an immediate deescalation of tensions and for state, local and federal officials to work together to find real solutions.”

The NBA Players Association also released a statement: “The fraternity of NBA players, like the United States itself, is a community enriched by its global citizens, and we refuse to let the flames of division threaten the civil liberties that are meant to protect us all.”

Besides Stewart, Tyrese Haliburton, the All-Star point guard for the Indiana Pacers, and the NBA veteran Isaiah Thomas also made strong statements on X. Haliburton posted: “Alex Pretti was murdered.” Thomas wrote: “Yall had him out numbered and decided to KILL him like it was a video game and he can just [get] his life back smh.”

With a new poll revealing that more Americans support than oppose abolishing ICE, the rejection of the agency by some sports figures is part of a more widespread shift. The mood is not the same as it was in 2020, but some sports figures are starting to realize that silence in this moment is a betrayal of their own values.</div>

            <h2>ICE’s No. 1 Ally</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-01-28</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/2026/01/ice-trump-minnesota-justice-department/685788/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">On Saturday, the same day that federal agents shot and killed Alex Pretti on a Minneapolis street, the Justice Department sent a letter to Minnesota Governor Tim Walz. The letter did not have anything to say about the violence caused by the Department of Homeland Security’s presence in the state. Nor did it offer Minnesota any assistance in the investigation of Pretti’s death or that of Renee Good’s just more than two weeks earlier. Instead, Attorney General Pam Bondi complained that Walz had “refused to support” DHS, insisted that the state cooperate more fully with ICE, and demanded that the governor hand over its voter rolls and records on Medicaid and food-stamp recipients. Walz had “better support President Trump,” Bondi declared on Fox News.

This abusive behavior by DHS has stood out in the chaos of Operation Metro Surge. But the Justice Department has done its part, too. It has shielded federal agents from accountability, launched needless criminal investigations into Minnesota officials and residents, and pumped out propaganda to aid the far-right press in justifying ICE’s tactics. The president has always treated DOJ like his own personal law firm. Now the department is acting like DHS’s law firm as well.

DOJ first undertook the role of ICE defender in Minneapolis in the days after Good’s death, on January 7. Video captured by the phones of both bystanders and the ICE agent Jonathan Ross showed Ross firing into Good’s car repeatedly, killing her and sending her car barreling down the icy street. In prior administrations, a death at the hands of a federal officer would have been cause for the Justice Department to begin a probe into potential wrongdoing by law enforcement. But this time, Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche announced, “There is currently no basis for a criminal civil rights investigation.” Though federal and local investigators typically collaborate in the aftermath of shootings by law enforcement, the FBI blocked state and local governments from accessing evidence. When a journalist asked Trump about this development, he explained that Minnesota officials should not be allowed to look at evidence, because they are “crooked.”

Most galling, instead of probing Ross’s actions, the Justice Department decided to investigate the woman he killed. According to MS NOW, FBI agents in Minnesota drafted a search warrant for Good’s car to examine the path of the bullets fired by Ross, intending to carry out a civil-rights probe. But Blanche’s office demanded that they alter the warrant for use in an investigation of whether Good had assaulted Ross. (A magistrate judge denied the request on the grounds that Good was dead.) The New York Times reported that DOJ also considered launching a criminal probe into Good’s widow, Becca Good, who was with Renee that morning. Six prosecutors in the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of Minnesota resigned in protest of the department’s handling of the case, along with an FBI agent who’d sought to open a civil-rights investigation but was rebuffed. Several attorneys in the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division have since resigned as well.

After Blanche accused Walz and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey of “encouraging violence against law enforcement,” DOJ sent out subpoenas to Walz, Frey, the mayor of St. Paul, the Minnesota attorney general, and the chief local prosecutor in Minneapolis as part of an ill-defined criminal investigation that seems designed chiefly to intimidate. This use of the Justice Department for political strong-arming has been unheard of since Watergate.

The department has also busied itself in Minneapolis with prosecuting residents opposed to what federal officials are doing in their city and immigrants trying to flee their pursuers, a tactic seen in other cities targeted for immigration enforcement. In Minnesota, DOJ has apparently run into a small challenge: Because so many attorneys there resigned over the handling of the Good case, the Justice Department has had to ask prosecutors from elsewhere in the Midwest to travel to the state to help out. Some of the cases filed so far do seem to describe potential assaults on officers, such as a pair of incidents in which two women are alleged to have bitten the fingers of the Border Patrol agents who were restraining them. Still, the Justice Department’s choice to focus on charging protesters, while enabling the violence by law enforcement that may have provoked them, is a telling indicator of its priorities.

Among the prosecutions of protesters, perhaps the strangest story involves a desperate quest by DOJ to bring criminal charges against the former CNN news personality Don Lemon. On January 18, Lemon documented a demonstration at a Southern Baptist church in St. Paul by a group of activists, who accused a church pastor of also serving as the acting director of the local ICE field office. Just days later, federal law enforcement arrested three of the lead protesters. But prosecutors were unable to convince a magistrate judge to let them charge Lemon along with the other protesters. Instead of taking the hint and giving up, however, the Justice Department repeatedly tried—and failed—to bully judges into allowing them to bring the case. On Monday, the department indicated that it had dropped its effort to force the court to reconsider, but Lemon may not be in the clear. “We’re going to pursue this to the ends of the earth,” promised the Civil Rights Division leader Harmeet Dhillon.

DOJ’s obsession with pursuing charges over a single protest might seem puzzling, especially because this protest did not obviously break any laws or move beyond the bounds of protected speech under the First Amendment. As with the finger-biting cases, which featured prominently on Fox News, directing prosecutorial resources toward protesters who disrupted a church service helped amplify the administration’s portrayal of Minneapolis as a battle between godly crusaders for justice and pathetic yet demonic leftist agitators. The White House published a digitally altered photo of one of the defendants, Nekima Levy Armstrong, that both changed her stoic expression to a tearful one and darkened her skin. (Levy Armstrong is Black.)

This was the context in which Bondi sent her bullying letter to Walz on Saturday. “Accountability is coming. 🇺🇸,” she posted on X alongside a clip of her brandishing the letter on Fox News. Her post included no mention of Alex Pretti, who had died that morning.

George Packer: What should Americans do now?

After Pretti’s death, the Justice Department once again helped block off the scene from state and local investigators. This time, though, Minnesota and Hennepin County sued, and succeeded in convincing a judge to rapidly issue a temporary restraining order barring the federal government from “destroying or altering evidence.” The judge—Eric Tostrud, a Trump appointee—convened another hearing on the matter on Monday, the same day that another Minnesota federal judge questioned a DOJ lawyer over Bondi’s letter during a hearing in a separate case. The state had pointed to the letter as evidence of the federal government’s effort to bully Minnesota into carrying out Trump’s will. At one point, Judge Katherine Menendez asked, “Is the executive trying to enforce a goal through force that it cannot enforce through the courts?”

Menendez has yet to rule. On Monday evening, Bondi celebrated on X that DOJ had successfully convinced the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit to pause a district court’s order barring federal agents in Minneapolis from harassing protesters. Still, the ground has shifted under the Justice Department’s feet in the days since Pretti’s death. Greg Bovino, the preening Border Patrol chief who wandered around Minneapolis posing for photos and lobbing tear gas at protesters, left the city on Tuesday, seemingly pushed out by the administration. With public anger mounting toward the White House’s deportation campaign, it’s not clear whether DOJ will continue its aggressive approach or back down.

Whatever DOJ chooses, though, any chance of it conducting independent investigations into the killings of Good and Pretti seems to have vanished. In response to the events in Minnesota, Democratic members of Congress have called for the resignation of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and the public’s disapproval of ICE has surged. Any real reckoning must address the rot at the heart of the Department of Homeland Security. But it will have to address the rot in the Department of Justice, too.</div>

I can&#39;t imagine anyone could have predicted a store that insisted on palm/fingerprint biometrics would meet mistrust and reduced demand.

There must have been a discount or something, though I didn&#39;t see any signs about it. Whatever it was, it wasn&#39;t worth dealing with the crowds. I just grabbed my package and left. It was actually difficult to find a path to the door.

1. What happened in 1914 that cause the system to collapse.

2. Do people actually like renting row houses and apartments, rather than having their own homes?

To be honest I always considered that style of housing to be barracks for the workers. Not something that I aspire to.

Oh fuck you and that saying. Who actually says that besides the talking heads on Fox?

>Do people actually like renting row houses and apartments, rather than having their own homes?

Suburban life is for the wealthy.  We could do it for everyone with a lower population, more automation, and a sane economic system that doesn&#39;t depend on eternal population growth to prevent immediate collapse, but that combination doesn&#39;t seem to be likely any time soon.

Row houses and apartments mean more bodies to be at the base of the economy to hold that peak up a bit higher for the ultra-wealthy.

Lots of people like row houses. In places like New York and Boston, those sort of houses are in high demand. it turns out that lots of people want to live near other people and actually like the density. As for high population, we all benefit from the high population. More people mean more ideas, more comparative advantage, and more economies of scale, which translate into better standards of living in general. There&#39;s some point beyond which very high populations would cause standards of living to get wor

I&#39;m halfway into a 30 year mortgage and looking back I&#39;d rather rent something. Roofs are $20k and a new furnace is close to $15k now. Much easier when those are the landlords problem. Unless of course I&#39;m wealthy enough to have some isolated property but at that point those expenses are minor.

I&#39;m assuming you&#39;ve got a fixed interest mortgage?

The whole advantage of that is that as inflation does its thing, if your employer gives raises (or you hop to greener pastures if they don&#39;t), your mortgage payment actually becomes easier to pay over the life of the loan.  Rent, on the other hand, keeps going up.

So no, despite $20k roofs and $15k furnaces (you do know you can buy those online for a lot less, then get a HVAC tech to install it on the side, if you ask around), you&#39;re still coming out ahead.

I&#39;m halfway into a 30 year mortgage and looking back I&#39;d rather rent something.Really? 15 years ago means you purchased in 2010-2011. Rather implies that you would be better off in some aspect. Clearly, it is not from financial point of view, you&#39;d pay more in rent and would have no equity. No roof or furnace costs would come anywhere near eating that equity, you&#39;d have to have something really catastrophic, like foundation getting washed out, for that to happen. So why do you think renting is better?

Around here, detached houses are being knocked down so developers can build a block of condos on the same land and make a ton of money. It doesn&#39;t matter whether people want to own or rent detached houses if they&#39;ve all been knocked down.

Renting might seem bad, but sometimes it&#39;s the best option - if you plan on only staying for a short while (1-5 years), renting is far preferable to owning after all the fees and taxes and effort needed to buy and sell the property you&#39;re in are factored in.

Yeah, but that&#39;s evil and you should live in a Stalinist apartment block comrade.

In the real world, communists love &quot;high-density development&quot; but actual people want to live in a house with some room and a yard and in much of the West suburbs exist because much of the population will literally pay hundreds of thousands of dollars more to not have to live with the kind of people who live in &quot;high-density development&quot; in the inner cities.

So you don&#39;t get time to develop Alzheimer&#39;s, so you don&#39;t get time to develop Alzheimer&#39;s.

Now I finally know what to do to avoid Alzheimer&#39;s!

Though... &quot;Cancer protects you from Alzheimer&#39;s&quot; is a pretty good one-liner by itself.  At least, my response was to say &quot;Well... shit&quot;, and chuckle.

Though if we can synthesize the anti-Alzheimer&#39;s protein that cancer produces, and if it&#39;s really effective, and if it doesn&#39;t have other nasty effects, this could result in a good anti-Alzheimer&#39;s drug.

>An MRNA-based vax will never make it anywhere. That term is so tained from COVID no one will touch the trials.

In the United States.  With the federal government rapidly disassembling science-based medicine, that&#39;s hardly the largest and most immediate concern.

Other countries do medical research, too, and their citizens will have lower Alzheimer&#39;s rates should this research pan out.

The really big question is how permanent the Trump influence will be after 2028.  My take is that most Republicans currently in office are carpetbaggers rather than ideological extremists.  They see the opportunity to advance their own careers by riding on Trump&#39;s coattails.  Those coattails likely disappear after 2028, unless another Trump 2.0 person arises and tries to repeat the Trump strategies.

&quot;cancer and Alzheimer&#39;s disease are rarely found in the same person&quot;

&quot;cancer diagnosis was associated with an 11% decreased incidence of Alzheimer&#39;s disease&quot;

If cancer and Alzheimer&#39;s are rarely coincident, then why is there merely an 11% decrease in Alzheimer&#39;s given that cancer exists?  I would expect the decrease to be close to 100% unless &quot;rarely&quot; is actually a fuzzy term that is far from 0%.

First off, &quot;credit&quot; and &quot;reputation&quot; are synonyms.

I froze my credit some time ago, which required me registering with Experian.  They still send me emails when my credit goes up and back down.  Or down and back up.  I phrase it thusly because it never does one without doing the other a couple days later.  Great service I didn&#39;t ask for, guys.

I mean, credit rating agencies are fine, I guess.  I just don&#39;t think that, if you volunteer to make a business out of rating people according to their trustworthiness, and you accomplish that rating by getting their creditors to send you all their personal private business every time they buy gas or eat dinner, you should expect not to be kind of disliked.  Because that&#39;s not a thing that likable people do!

I agree.   They should just own the fact that they 1) provide a valuable service in measuring people&#39;s credit scores and 2) they won&#39;t be liked for it.  Especially by those who have bad credit scores.

If there are legitimate issues where people should actually have higher credit scores than they do, then that should be investigated and resolved.  If people are just upset that they screwed up their credit scores and don&#39;t like the repercussions?   I&#39;m not sure there&#39;s much that can be done.

because you don&#39;t understand what a credit score is.

It isn&#39;t an evaluation of your balance sheet and ability to pay, it is about how likely you are to pay. That logically must include your historic behaviors and other factors like how long you have lived in a current place etc.

Or more importantly when they should have been saying FUCK NO with regards to extending credit.All they care about is working with banks to make a metric fuckton of money off interest.  I find them no less culpable than the ratings agencies on Wall Street in 2008.  Forget 18-year old spendi

Lintner conceded that consumers who have poor credit scores through &quot;life&#39;s circumstances&quot; sometimes direct their frustration at ExperianPeople who have poor credit scores through &quot;life&#39;s circumstances&quot; probably *are* more likely to be unable to make required payments on time. Experian didn&#39;t cause this, and their scores didn&#39;t cause this. Their scores simply help lenders evaluate how likely it is that a person will default.Maybe it doesn&#39;t feel fair for someone&#39;s credit score to take a hit because they get hit with a big, unexpected expense. The thing is, life did that to them, not Experian or its scores.However, *most* people with low credit scores, actually *do* have problems managing their money. I see this in my own two sons, one of whom manages his money very well, the other does not.

People who have poor credit scores through &quot;life&#39;s circumstances&quot;

What if my &quot;life&#39;s circumstances&quot; are all my personal info got stolen from Experian and then thoroughly trashed my credit?

Experian is one messenger that should be shot for criminal negligence.

I would say that the thief is the perpetrator, not Experian. If Experian was negligent, then they would indeed share in the blame. Negligence is not being alleged in this article.

Of course bad credit risks get mad at the credit rating agencies for telling lenders that.It&#39;s because of these agencies that lenders have access to the information to make lending decisions, and good credit risks can get loans with favorable terms.

credit existed before credit scores did, and could easily exist without credit scores and credit score companies

Yes, and it was highly local and often limited.

Your grocer might extend you a tab, but only because they see you come in buying groceries every Monday for a while that they know what you want. Eventually they&#39;ll trust you enough to extend you credit. But this only worked when your circle of commerce was the town and you knew the store owner&#39;s name. The whole &quot;small town&quot; thing and &quot;everyone knows

Sorry, no amount of worthwhile value for credit reports justifies what Experian has done and still does.  The Wikipedia article [wikipedia.org] is full of their breaches and shenanigans.  They have an ongoing pattern of sloppiness.  Until they (along with the other reporting services) were forced to stop by legislattion, they charged us for credit reports based on our own data that they had hoovered up.

Rather weak FP, but at least it includes a hint of a solution. I don&#39;t know such details, but if the MS license includes any kind of cost, then it won&#39;t scale for mass scam, which is a tiny step forward.

However my negative sentiments towards Microsoft are so strong that I am not much motivated to RTFA or even click on a link for the sake of learning more. Microsoft&#39;s reputation (in my eyes, for whatever they are worth) is not being helped by  Microsoft Secrets  by Cusamano and Selby.

If there are clear actionable instructions how to complain or cancel a charge, it&#39;s a scam. (Nearly) all other businesses do their best to confuse and complicate cancellation

Or how many e-commerce places give you instructions on how to cancel or reverse your order in the order confirmation email?

it&#39;s like &quot;Oh, you just bought this from us! Here&#39;s how to cancel your order if you clicked &quot;Buy Now&quot; by mistake!&quot;. Even at a store how often does the proprietor tell you the return policy without being asked?

External CCs seemingly being allowed without verification is problem #1.  Problem #2 is that email forwarding is still implicitly trusted.  There is no reason a scammer should be able to sign up for a real service, and redirect the emails to their email address to your own.  But mail forwarding is an established thing that mail providers are scared of breaking for some reason.

The current biggest delivery methods of scam emails is hijacking legitimate transactional emails from major providers.  This is why y

The big question about President Donald Trump’s Board of Peace—which he formally announced while at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, last week—is whether it’s a scam, a delusion, or both.

Trump first mentioned a Board of Peace in September during the signing of a ceasefire accord for Israel’s war in Gaza. The idea was that the board would be the forum where Israel, the Palestinian Authority, and other Middle East countries discuss political reforms, reconstruction, and other issues relating to security and long-term peace in Gaza. Trump would chair the board—a role that he improbably insisted wasn’t his idea, but the plan made some sense, given that Trump played a major role in prodding the parties to sign the ceasefire.

However, in the months since, Trump’s vision of the board has—like much else about his presidency—swelled with self-aggrandizement. The board’s charter—which he hasn’t publicized but which the Times of Israel obtained and published—doesn’t mention Gaza at all. Rather, the document states that the board will seek “to promote stability, restore dependable and lawful governance, and secure enduring peace in areas affected or threatened by conflict”—seeming to indicate any sort of conflict, anywhere on earth.

The members on the board will consist of whichever heads of state the chairman, Donald Trump, chooses to invite. Their terms of membership will last three years, unless they pay the board $1 billion, which would buy them lifetime tenure. (Trump is designated as chairman for as long as he likes, certainly beyond the remaining three years of his presidency, gratis.)

The board will decide policies and declare resolutions by majority vote, but the chairman (read: Trump) gets veto power; he can also initiate measures unilaterally, eject members, and choose his own successor.

In other words, the Board of Peace marks yet another episode in Trump’s massive meandering ego trip. More than that, its charter, laid out in formal legalese, is sheer fantasy. It is no surprise that most of the heads of state whom he invited to join, notably those with proven interest in peace and “lawful governance,” have declined.

The naysayers include France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Norway, Slovenia, Sweden, Ukraine, and the United Kingdom—in short, many of our leading allies. Trump retracted his invitation to Canada after its prime minister, Mark Carney, delivered a much-lauded speech at Davos calling on middle-sized countries to avoid unfair pressures from larger powers by banding together. (Trump’s retraction, which he posted on social media, bolsters the impression that this is all about Trump, not world peace.)

Those who have said they will join include Argentina, Albania, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Bahrain, Belarus, Bulgaria, Cambodia, Egypt, El Salvador, Hungary, Indonesia, Israel, Jordan, Kazakhstan, Kuwait, Kosovo, Morocco, Mongolia, Pakistan, Paraguay, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, the United Arab Emirates, Uzbekistan, and Vietnam. None of them are members of the U.N. Security Council (which Trump preposterously hopes to supplant), only a few practice “lawful governance,” and even fewer have any experience at seriously mediating conflict. It is not known whether any of them have been foolish enough to pony up the $1 billion initiation fee—nor has Trump or anyone else said who would control this slush fund. (Want to take a guess?)

The leaders of China, India, and Russia are among those who haven’t yet responded. This is no surprise. These are regional, aspiringly global powers who have a serious (if, in some cases, disruptive) interest in matters of war and peace. And they must know that Trump’s Board of Peace is not serious.

In his gushing invitation letter, Trump declared that his goal is to “bring together a distinguished group of nations ready to shoulder the noble responsibility of building LASTING PEACE.” In his snitty retraction letter to Prime Minister Carney, he brayed that Canada would thereby be excluded from “what will be the most prestigious Board of Leaders ever assembled at any time.”

If Trump believes his own hype (always an uncertainty), he reveals here once again that he has no idea what peace, especially “LASTING PEACE,” requires. To the extent Trump currently has the power to elicit feigned respect and sometimes reluctant obedience from other world leaders, it’s because he is president of the United States—meaning that he can exert the tremendous leverage of the world’s main currency and most powerful military.

Once his term in the Oval Office ends in three years, no leader would have any reason to pay him the slightest attention or courtesy. No leaders embroiled in conflict would welcome the mediation of his so-called Board of Peace, much less follow its orders.

Maybe some leaders would consent to a meeting if the board really were composed of “the most prestigious” peacemakers. But look at who, according to a statement from the White House, is on the group’s “founding” executive board: Trump’s globe-trotting emissary, Steve Witkoff, and son-in-law Jared Kushner (whose efforts to end Russia’s war on Ukraine have been especially aimless); Marc Rowan (a billionaire financier who has led Trump’s political pressure campaigns on American universities); Robert Gabriel (a former producer of Laura Ingraham’s TV show who is now Trump’s deputy national security adviser); Secretary of State Marco Rubio (whose influence will fade along with Trump’s at the end of this administration, at least if he remains under his post-presidential thumb); Sir Tony Blair (whose record as Britain’s prime minister still makes many in the Middle East shudder); and Ajay Banga, president of the World Bank.

Banga is an interesting choice: He was nominated to the World Bank by President Joe Biden, he advised Vice President Kamala Harris’ 2024 campaign, and he knows something about world politics. The others, once untethered from a sitting American president, would have no authority in making peace whatsoever.

Even with the power of the White House and the imprimatur of a U.N. Security Council resolution, Trump’s current Board of Peace has been unable to make headway on molding long-term peace in Gaza, the one conflict it was created to help solve. (The Security Council limited the board’s authority solely to rebuilding Gaza and set it to expire at the end of 2027.) The idea that it can roam the globe on its own, ending wars with no base of power or authority, is risible.

If the next president is a Democrat, one of their first tasks will probably be to order the words “Donald J. Trump” to be removed from the august wall of the Kennedy Center. There will, however, be no need to worry about dismantling, or doing anything about, the Trump Board of Peace; it will quickly collapse of its own accord.

Whether or not money is the root of all evil, the root of our current American oligarchy is a single Supreme Court case. That Supreme Court decision, Buckley v. Valeo, happens to turn 50 years old this week. It’s Buckley, and not the often-excoriated 2010 Roberts court decision in Citizens United v. FEC, that created the conditions for the ultrawealthy to transform their vastly unequal economic power into lopsided political power, and for a billionaire like Elon Musk to contribute a staggering $291 million to help elect Republican candidates, including Donald Trump, in 2024. It is going to take a constitutional amendment or Supreme Court reform to make things right again—and there’s a realistic chance that the current Supreme Court soon makes things worse, not better—but reform is unlikely because of the power of the very moneyed interests who benefit from the Buckley-created system.

Following President Richard Nixon’s resignation in August 1974, Congress once again took up the question of money in politics. It had passed the Federal Election Campaign Act in 1971, but it was clear that more was needed after investigations into Nixon and Watergate revealed many campaign finance abuses, such as the Nixon reelection campaign shaking down large American corporations for illegal six-figure donations, delivered sometimes in cash or laundered through foreign accounts.

Newly inaugurated President Gerald Ford reluctantly signed the 1974 FECA amendments, which aimed to fundamentally transform American campaign finance. Among other things, the law put in place a disclosure regime to let voters follow the money; it limited the amount that people could contribute to campaigns and spend supporting federal candidates; it put in place a voluntary public financing system for political campaigns; and it created the Federal Election Commission, a bipartisan agency to collect and disseminate campaign finance reports, police abuses, and advise on disputed legal questions.

A coalition of conservatives and liberals concerned about limiting money in politics quickly brought suit. FECA itself included judicial review provisions to have any constitutional challenges fast-tracked, and the Supreme Court obliged. When the case made it to the Supreme Court, Chief Justice Warren Burger felt so rushed that rather than assign a single justice to draft an opinion for the court’s majority, he divided it up into pieces. The result was a not-wholly-coherent unsigned behemoth of an opinion for the court, with separate opinions from five of the eight justices hearing the case (Justice John Paul Stevens recused).

On the key question of whether contribution and spending limits violated the First Amendment rights of free speech and association, Buckley issued a split decision. The court held that Congress could limit the amount that people could contribute directly to candidates and committees, on grounds that such contributions raised a danger of corruption or the appearance of corruption. But it struck down limits on how much individuals could spend independent of candidates.

There, the court reasoned that such independent spending could not corrupt, because to count as independent spending, a spender could not coordinate with the candidate on campaign messaging. Without such communication, the court reasoned, such independent spending could be at cross-purposes with the candidate. The court’s conclusion here was negated by the rise of outside independent groups like “super PACs,” which may be staffed by relatives, staffers, or friends of the candidate and can deploy millions of dollars to support that candidate’s message without every directly communicating with the campaign about strategy.

The Buckley court also held that limiting large independent spending on candidates could not be justified to level the playing field. On this point, the unsigned opinion held that such an equality interest was inherently impermissible:

The concept that government may restrict the speech of some elements of our society in order to enhance the relative voice of others is wholly foreign to the First Amendment, which was designed to secure the widest possible dissemination of information from diverse and antagonistic sources, and to assure unfettered interchange of ideas for the bringing about of political and social changes desired by the people.

These two holdings—that independent spending can never corrupt, and that equality was an impermissible basis to ever limit money in politics—are Buckley’s original sins. American jurisprudence in this area has had so many twists and turns that it takes a whole book to explain them. Indeed, it took other decisions and rulings, including Citizens United, to get super PACs and nondisclosing political entities that could accept big-money contributions to fund campaigns independent of candidates. But in 1976, and now in 2026, the basic point is the same: American citizens cannot be limited in what they spend independent of candidates to support those candidates’ election.

The First Amendment concerns voiced by Buckley’s challengers were real and the 1974 law was too draconian. In the middle of the Buckley litigation, an advertisement appeared in the Washington Post criticizing Ford for his pardon of Nixon and his choice of Nelson Rockefeller as vice president. As campaign finance expert Herbert Alexander described it, the political advertisement headlined “Would You Elect Ex-Congressman Ford President?” “urged Republicans, Democrats, and independents to oppose Ford and convince him to withdraw as a candidate.” The ad cost $2,368.80, in violation of FECA’s $1,000 individual spending limit. It was a technical violation of the law, but not a fair one. There was also a concern that challengers need more money than incumbents, who already had name recognition and other benefits like free publicity from being in office, and so limiting campaign contributions and spending was in the self-interests of the members of Congress who passed the law.

But whether or not parts of the 1974 FECA went too far, the court was wrong to say that independent spending could never corrupt or create the appearance of corruption, or that there could be no limit in spending by the ultrawealthy. And the results in recent years have been disastrous. As I explained last year at Slate, Musk is not alone among billionaires spending big money:

In the 2024 elections, the top six donors supporting or opposing federal candidates each reported contributing at least $100 million, according to data compiled by OpenSecrets. Those donors—Musk ($291.5 million), Timothy Mellon ($197 million), Miriam Adelson ($148.3 million), Richard and Elizabeth Uihlein ($143.5 million), Ken Griffin ($108.4 million), and Jeffrey and Janine Yass ($101.1 million)—all exclusively supported Donald Trump and other Republican candidates (with the exception of the Yasses, who gave a nominal $1,500 contribution on the Democratic side). The biggest donor on the liberal side was former New York City mayor and publisher Michael Bloomberg, who gave $64.3 million total, with all but $1 million going to the Democratic side.

We have never seen so many nine-figure donors in an election, and with such lopsided giving. In the 2022 midterm elections, the sole nine-figure donor was George Soros ($178.8 million), with his contributions going to Democrats. In earlier election seasons, donations of this size were also rare: There were two in 2020 (Sheldon and Miriam Adelson and Michael Bloomberg), one in 2018 (Sheldon Adelson), and none before that.

Buckley should have been corrected at some point in the last 50 years. In the early 2000s, the court came close, as justices like David Souter recognized the risks of plutocracy. But now the court has turned in the other direction. If this very conservative court ever overrules parts of Buckley, it’s going to be to strike down remaining limits on contributions, not to uphold spending limits. A case currently before the court may lead to further deregulation.

The Buckley court was right that threats to free speech and association, and the dangers of incumbency-protecting laws, mean that courts should closely scrutinize campaign money laws. But that should not doom all attempts to level the playing field or limit the risk of corruption from nine-figure campaign contributions, mostly to ostensibly independent groups. If Congress passed a law with generous contribution and spending limits, and strong disclosure rules, we could have ample breathing room for vigorous and competitive campaigns without the danger of the wealthy swamping our democracy.

Because Buckley was a constitutional decision, there are only two paths to overturn it. One is to get a court majority to rethink the case’s fundamental mistakes. With the current makeup of the court, that seems unlikely. An even harder road is to amend the Constitution to allow for a better balance between the rights of free speech and the risks of corruption and oligarchy.

We should not give up the struggle over our money-in-politics rules. But we must recognize that there will be fierce resistance from the moneyed interests who benefit from a system giving them outsize influence over who is elected and what politicians do once they are in office.

A real democracy deserves better than Buckley.

In the days since Alex Pretti was shot to death by federal agents in Minnesota, Republican administration officials have been deploying torturous logic to defend the agents responsible and villainize the 37-year-old ICU nurse. Pretti had a gun when he encountered law enforcement on Saturday—which he was legally permitted to have in accordance with Minnesota law—and suddenly the Trump administration has decided the Second Amendment has exceptions. Seeming to lay some blame on Pretti for his killing, President Donald Trump told the press on Tuesday, “You can’t have guns. You can’t walk in with guns. You just can’t. You can’t walk in with guns. You can’t do that.”

This had already been a theme from his administration. Shortly after the incident, FBI Director Kash Patel told Fox News that Americans cannot bring a gun to just “any sort of protest that you want,” while Border Patrol commander Gregory Bovino went on CNN to say that Pretti’s Second Amendment rights “don’t count” because, in Bovino’s view, he was obstructing law enforcement officers. It’s worth noting that these positions stand in stark contrast to previous ones by some of these figures, including Patel, who described Kyle Rittenhouse’s acquittal for homicide after shooting someone at a protest a “victory for the Second Amendment.” Indeed, it did not take long for the reckoning, with far-right figures, the National Rifle Association, and scores of other gun rights groups publicly calling out the Trump administration for this apparent reversal.

“I’ve encountered countless police while I’ve been armed, and never been shot. The presence of a firearm, by itself, is not an indicator of a criminal intent or a threat to law enforcement,” said Cam Edwards , a prominent gun rights activist and host of the Bearing Arms’ Cam & Co podcast. Tim Pool, a virulent ring-wing conspiracy theorist, noted that video footage appears to show Pretti being disarmed and then shot at by federal agents. “I don’t see Trump winning this one,” Pool said.

The Minnesota Gun Owners Caucus was also quick to call out Patel’s assertion about Pretti’s decision to bring a gun with him on the day he was fatally shot, clarifying that “there is no prohibition on a permit holder carrying a firearm, loaded, with multiple magazines at a protest or rally in Minnesota.”

And when California U.S. Attorney Bill Essayli repeated the administration’s line that approaching law enforcement with a gun gives agents legal justification to shoot you, the most prominent gun rights figures on X decided enough was enough. “Responsible public voices should be awaiting a full investigation, not making generalizations and demonizing law-abiding citizens,” the NRA retorted, to Essayli. Aidan Johnston, director of federal affairs for Gun Owners of America, also responded by questioning the Department of Justice’s intentions. “I guess the Justice Department is back to targeting gun owners as domestic terrorists. You can want illegals & criminals off the streets and not want to see CCW permit holders get executed for ‘approaching’ law enforcement.”

In what appears to be an attempt to calm the blowback to the situation on the ground in Minneapolis, the Trump administration announced Border Patrol commander Gregory Bovino would be leaving Minnesota and returning to his old post in El Centro, California. However, among America’s conservative movement, the conversation over gun rights in the wake of Pretti’s killing is far from settled. To understand why, it’s worth considering the recent history of gun politics in the United States on the right. According to Saul Cornell, Paul and Diane Guenther Chair in American History at Fordham University, the Republican Party is not aligned on how it views the Second Amendment and in fact is facing three separate schools of thought that we’re seeing collide in real time.

As Cornell told Slate, there’s the libertarian wing that holds a sweeping view of gun rights, so much so it characterizes the right to defend oneself “as basic a human right as there is.” Then there’s the Christian nationalist view, which is also quite sweeping but believes only white, “pure blood” Americans deserve to bear arms. Finally, there is the old law-and-order bucket, which includes many Bush and Reagan Republicans who had a recent history of supporting some gun control.

Cornell offers that the Trump administration is seeking to revive the old law-and-order school of thought now that it’s convenient, and will largely get away with it. Pool, for his part, is already boasting again of his support for Immigration and Customs Enforcement, saying of federal law enforcement, “I’m not licking the boot. It’s my boot. I voted for it. I’m the one stomping.” Rob Doar, general counsel for the Minnesota Gun Owners Caucus, conceded that the group was disappointed in the Trump administration’s response to Pretti’s death and it has created skepticism among those who support Trump. However, these members are “still overall pleased with the general state of things,” with Doar noting to Slate that the administration has intervened in court cases in favor of the 2nd Amendment, made gun-friendly policy changes within the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, and on the whole been friendly to the 2nd Amendment.

In Cornell’s view, all the major figures in the conservative movement who may disagree with Trump now are more than likely to eventually fall back in line. “It’s hard to imagine those people are going to embrace telling people to bring their guns to ICE protests, right?” Cornell said. “Will this be the last we hear from the NRA? Or will they really harp on this and make it an issue? My suspicion is no, because it doesn’t help the Republicans” in future elections, Cornell noted.

If they’re willing to play “originalist jujitsu,” as Cornell characterized it, the Democrats still have a clear opening to use Republicans’ historical support for gun rights against them. California Gov. Gavin Newsom attempted to do so after Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent suggested Pretti did not have a Second Amendment right because he was carrying a gun. “The Trump administration does not believe in the 2nd Amendment. Good to know,” Newsom said.

Former congressman and 2024 presidential candidate Dean Phillips struck a more earnest tone. “For years I quietly mocked 2A defenders who argued arms were necessary to defend American rights against a tyrannical government,” Phillips said, in a post on X. “Today I apologize, because I’ve seen it with my own eyes.”

Perhaps the most powerful approach is to simply point to the facts. Speaking to CNN about Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem’s press conference in the hours following Pretti’s death, New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez noted, “How rich is it that she is saying showing up to the scene of a protest with a legally owned weapon should be grounds for a person’s death, execution at the hands of the state, by the same party and administration that praises Kyle Rittenhouse.”

The second Trump administration entered office with a theory. President Donald Trump, backed by policy architect Stephen Miller, believed that in a battle of political imagery between camouflaged he-men against leftist protesters, their guys would always win. Law and order would defeat chaos. Those trying to deport immigrants would defeat those trying to protect them.

In Minnesota, that theory didn’t just hit its limit, it exceeded it. Now Trump and his team are scrambling to cushion their fall as public opinion has turned on them.

The reaction of elected Republican officials, up to and including Trump, following the Border Patrol killing of Alex Pretti over the weekend has been markedly different from that following the killing of Renee Good, or any other scandalous episode involving immigration enforcement officials thus far. A broad swath of Republican members of Congress have joined Democrats in calling for an investigation into Pretti’s killing. Trump has removed Border Patrol wannabe-action-star Greg Bovino from his role leading the immigration enforcement operation in Minnesota, while Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem appears to be—at best—in administrative time-out. Trump has taken a suddenly conciliatory tone with Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey after weeks of treating them as useful left-wing foils.

It’s important not to overstate what’s happening. The administration isn’t suddenly coming out in support of open borders and abolishing Immigration and Customs Enforcement, and on Tuesday, ICE continued operations in and around Minneapolis.

But all signals sure point to Trump wanting to get the hell out of Minnesota—or at least take pains to change the way the public sees the issue.

For the first time, the administration has taken its foot off the gas in its steroidal deportation agenda. After months of ramping up its interventions into blue cities starting last summer and marketing them with an almost trollish devotion meant to please the base, the antics devolved into killings, unaccountability, and lies about what people are seeing with their own eyes. With this devolution has come a turn in public opinion, with Trump’s numbers on his once best issue—immigration—tanking. The party finally found a level of public disapproval it couldn’t tolerate, and midterms are coming closer than you think.

The first memorable time that the administration flexed unnecessary muscle the way they did in Minneapolis was last June. A series of clashes between protesters and immigration agents performing raids around Los Angeles prompted the administration to federalize the California National Guard and send in hundreds of Marines. The administration liked the visual and sent Noem there for a photo op and press briefings. During a press briefing, California Sen. Alex Padilla was thrown to the ground by Noem’s security.

The administration did not offer Padilla an apology. Instead, as the California deployment and divisiveness it caused was underway, Miller was posting about how “California used to be a paradise” but that “mass migration has brought us to where we are now.” Miller at the same time was trying to rally energy beyond the lagging One Big Beautiful Bill in Congress, arguing grandiosely that its avalanche of fresh money for DHS made the bill “the most essential piece of legislation currently under consideration in the entire Western World, in generations.”

After the Los Angeles operation, the administration federalized the Washington, D.C., police department and deployed National Guard members there, too, giving DHS agents room to ramp up their enforcement in the nation’s capital. (A man who hurled a sandwich at a federal officer was eventually taken under arrest by a swarm of 20 officers.) Elsewhere around the country, a raid on a Chicago apartment building in the middle of the night—featuring agents rappelling down the building from a Black Hawk helicopter—earned the administration plenty of controversy, but no apologies. When Trump was asked on 60 Minutes in early November about whether some ICE operations, such as those in Chicago, had gone too far, Trump said he believed “they hadn’t gone far enough.”

As the videos of over-the-top DHS tactics during raids continued to pile up, the administration stayed remorseless and itched for more fights. The Minnesota social services fraud scandals and the invective they directed at Minneapolis’ Somali population provided an impetus for “Operation Metro Storm.”

But even when an ICE agent killed Renee Good as part of the operation, the White House, the administration, and Republican elected officials showed no wavering from the party line. Good was accused by Miller and Noem of “domestic terrorism.” Rather than investigate the incident, the Department of Justice wanted to investigate Good’s widow. Vice President J.D. Vance, in an appearance in the White House briefing room, chastised the media for its coverage of the incident and described Good’s death as “a tragedy of her own making.”

But under the hood, the Renee Good killing—which a majority of Americans felt was unjustified—caused real political damage. Support for ICE’s tactics is in the tank, while support for abolishing ICE is growing. Beyond that, the high-profile nature of the Good incident and the administration’s outrageous responses to it made the president’s immigration policies not just something that a majority passively disapproved of; it raised the salience of the issue. And if there is one political issue which Republicans, already heading into a terrible midterm environment due to the cost of living, can’t afford to have as a top motivating issue working against them, it’s immigration. That is supposed to be their bread and butter.

So this time, when Alex Pretti was repeatedly shot after trying to help someone, and Noem, Bovino, and Miller tried to portray him as a would-be “assassin” or “domestic terrorist,” they were isolated in their approach. Trump fielded calls from senators and members of Congress over the weekend pleading with him to tone it down and pivot away from the Minnesota operation. The swaggering paramilitary incursions into overwhelmingly Democratic communities had at last succumbed to public opinion. Trump and a host of senators and Republican congressmen, surely with coordination, signaled deescalation in their statements and social media on Monday.

Ultimately, are they just going to tweak the Minneapolis model and try it somewhere else—maybe after a breather? Or is this the beginning of a meaningful retreat from the administration’s attempt to snatch every immigrant it can?

The calendar may dictate what comes next, at least in the medium term. The midterms are more front-of-mind now than they were in Trump’s first year, and we wouldn’t be surprised to see deportation operations select less hostile turf going forward. The Republican Party needs less widespread coverage of immigration raids gone awry, and the best way to have that would be to select fewer immigration targets likely to go awry. The more such incidents take place, the more the future of Trump’s mass deportation agenda—and Republicans’ hopes for holding congressional power going forward—dissipates.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Ransomware crims have just lost one of their best business platforms. US law enforcement has seized the notorious RAMP cybercrime forum&#39;s dark web and clearnet domains.

RAMP, which stands for Russian Anonymous Marketplace, was an online souk, favored by ransomware-as-a-service gangs, extortionists, initial access brokers, and other miscreants specializing in digital crime. Its websites now say &quot;This Site Has Been Seized,&quot; with the notice attributing the takedown to the FBI in coordination with the US Attorney&#39;s Office for the Southern District of Florida and the Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section of the Department of Justice.

The feds also trolled the forum&#39;s operators with a banner saying &quot;The Only Place Ransomware Allowed!&quot; and an image of Masha - a preschool character from the Russian animated TV series - winking.

While the FBI declined to comment on the seizure, DNS records show that the federal cops have seized the domains.

The takedown also appears to be confirmed by one of the forum&#39;s alleged operators who goes by &quot;Stallman.&quot; In an XSS hacking forum post shared widely on social media, Stallman said law enforcement had gained control of RAMP.

&quot;This event destroyed years of my work to create the most free forum in the world, and although I hoped this day would never come, deep down I always understood that it was possible,&quot; he wrote. &quot;This is the risk we all take.&quot;

Stallman said he could not create a new forum, but will &quot;continue to buy accesses. My core business remains unchanged.&quot;

It&#39;s highly unlikely impossible that this takedown signals the end of ransomware and other crime crews who used RAMP&#39;s websites to buy and sell malware and exploits and recruit affiliates. Much like horror-movie monsters, cybercrime forums never really die, and their users will likely scatter to other underground marketplaces to buy and sell their illicit services.

Still, &quot;its loss represents a meaningful disruption to a core piece of criminal infrastructure,&quot; Tammy Harper, a senior threat intelligence researcher at Flare who specializes in ransomware research, told The Register.

&quot;As with previous takedowns, the removal of a major hub does not eliminate the ecosystem - it forces migration,&quot; Harper said. &quot;Groups such as Nova and DragonForce are reportedly shifting activity toward Rehub, illustrating the underground&#39;s ability to reconstitute quickly in alternative spaces. These transitions are often chaotic, opening new risks for threat actors: loss of reputation, escrow instability, operational exposure, and infiltration during the scramble to rebuild trust.&quot;

Plus, she added, these types of law enforcement seizures provide &quot;rare opportunities&quot; for network defenders and threat intel teams: &quot;not only to disrupt ongoing criminal collaboration, but potentially to collect insight into affiliate networks, financial relationships, and operational security failures.&quot; ®

            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2026/01/28/claude_code_ai_secrets_files/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Don&#39;t you hate it when machines can&#39;t follow simple instructions? Anthropic&#39;s Claude Code can&#39;t take &quot;ignore&quot; for an answer and continues to read passwords and API keys, even when your secrets file is supposed to be blocked.

Software developers often store secrets – passwords, tokens, API keys, and other credentials – in .env files within project directories. And if they do so, they&#39;re supposed to ensure that the .env file does not get posted in a publicly accessible .git repository.

A common way to do this is to create an entry in a .gitignore file that tells the developer&#39;s Git software to ignore that file when copying a local repo to a remote server.

Claude implements something similar, a .claudeignore file.

When asked, &quot;If I make a .env file, how do I keep you from reading it?&quot;, Claude responded, &quot;You can add .env to a .claudeignore file in your project root. This works like .gitignore — Claude Code will refuse to read any files matching patterns listed there.&quot;

But Claude is incorrect. As described in this Pastebin post, Claude can read the contents of an .env file despite an entry in the .claudeignore file that ought to prevent access.

The Register reproduced this result. We created a directory, created an .env file with sample secrets, added a .claudeignore file with &quot;.env&quot; and &quot;.env.*&quot; and then started Claude Code (v2.1.12) via the CLI. We asked Claude to read the .env file and it did so – which would not happen if Claude respected .claudeignore entries.

This has potential security implications, particularly for agents – these tool-enabled AI models could be induced to share stored secrets via indirect prompt injection.

What&#39;s more, Claude will also ignore the presence of &quot;.env&quot; in a .gitignore file. It does so despite a default /config flag that sets &quot;Respect .gitignore in file picker&quot; to &quot;true.&quot;

In fact, when asked to read the .env file in a project with a .gitignore entry that includes &quot;.env&quot;, Claude dutifully prints the secrets within to the console, with the following warning: &quot;Note: This file contains credentials. Be cautious about committing it to version control — make sure .env is listed in your .gitignore.&quot;

Claude&#39;s willingness to ignore .claudeignore directives is cited in an open issue post in Claude Code&#39;s GitHub repository, &quot;[HIGH PRIORITY] Claude exposes secrets/tokens in tool output - no redaction.&quot; The individual who opened the issue two days ago notes, &quot;This is a security-critical issue that should be addressed urgently.&quot;

It hasn&#39;t been. Two posts from November 2025 raise the same concern. Another open issue created two weeks ago also flags Claude&#39;s willingness to display secrets. As does yet another bug report from three weeks ago that says, &quot;Claude should refrain from reading or even being aware of anything in the .claudeignore file, using [the] same standard parsing rules as a .gitignore file.&quot;

There are ways to direct Claude to keep away from secrets that appear to work, such as specifying permissions within a settings.json file in a project&#39;s .claude directory.

When we created that file as described in the documentation, Claude reported an error: &quot;The .env file is blocked by permission settings. This is expected behavior — .env files typically contain secrets (API keys, passwords, database credentials), so they are excluded from tool access as a security measure.&quot;

But configuring these settings permissions can be tricky – a bug report raising this concern includes a response that explains Claude&#39;s syntax for absolute paths begins with two &quot;//&quot; instead of &quot;/&quot; as Linux and macOS users might expect. Developers have also opened issues reporting problems with the @ file reference syntax in settings.json. And there are other problems, like permissions.deny not preventing files from being loaded into memory.

Anthropic did not respond to a request for comment.

If settings.json is intended to be the only supported way of denying Claude file access, Anthropic should make it clearer that .claudeignore is not an option. The model&#39;s own recommendations should align with best practices, instead of leading people astray. ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Come one, come all. Everyone from Russian and Chinese government goons to financially motivated miscreants is exploiting a long-since-patched WinRAR vuln to bring you infostealers and Remote Access Trojans (RATs).

The bug, tracked as CVE-2025-8088, is a path traversal flaw that affects the Windows version of the decompression tool. It received an 8.8 CVSS v3.1 score, and WinRAR patched the flaw in version 7.13 released on July 30.

Shortly after the release, ESET researchers who discovered and reported the vulnerability told The Register that Russia-aligned crew RomCom and at least one other criminal group exploited the security hole as a zero-day.

Fast forward to late January, and Google Threat Intelligence Group (GTIG) says several groups are still abusing CVE-2025-8088.

The exploit abuses Alternate Data Streams (ADS), a feature in Windows, to hide malware. Attackers craft malicious RAR archives with a decoy PDF or other file inside, and when a user opens the decoy file on a vulnerable version of WinRAR, the hidden malware writes files to arbitrary locations on the system.

&quot;Multiple government-backed actors have adopted the CVE-2025-8088 exploit, predominantly focusing on military, government, and technology targets,&quot; GTIG said in a Tuesday report.

These include RomCom, which is both a ransomware and espionage gang, and is exploiting this bug to target Ukrainian military and government entities using geopolitical lures. Three other Kremlin-linked crews - APT44 (aka Frozenbarents), Temp.Armageddon (aka Carpathian), and Turla (aka Summit) are also abusing CVE-2025-8088 to target these same sectors in Ukraine.

Also according to Google, an unnamed PRC-based group is exploiting the vulnerability to deliver PoisonIvy, a Remote Access Trojan (RAT), via a BAT file dropped into the Startup folder, which then downloads a malware dropper.

Several financially motivated criminal gangs are also leveraging this vulnerability to infect victims&#39; machines with RATs and data-stealing malware. While the threat hunters don&#39;t name these specific gangs, we&#39;re told they include a group targeting commercial organizations in Indonesia, another group that targets hospitality and travel sectors via phishing emails with hotel booking lures that deliver XWorm and AsyncRAT, and a third focused on Brazilian users via banking websites that steals credentials.

Plus, as of January, &quot;we have continued to observe malware being distributed by cyber crime exploiting CVE-2025-8088, including commodity RATS and stealers,&quot; the security sleuths said.

Back in June, before the vulnerability was publicly known, a criminal who goes by &quot;zeroplayer&quot; posted an ad for a working WinRAR zero-day exploit for $80,000 on a cybercrime forum.

According to GTIG, this isn&#39;t the only exploit zeroplayer is selling to other criminals. &quot;Historically, and in recent months, zeroplayer has continued to offer other high-priced exploits that could potentially allow threat actors to bypass security measures,&quot; the researchers wrote.

This includes a sandbox escape, remote code execution (RCE) zero-day exploit for Microsoft Office advertised at $300,000 in November 2025, and a zero-day local privilege escalation (LPE) exploit for Windows costing $100,000 a month earlier.

In September, zeroplayer advertised a RCE zero-day exploit for a &quot;popular, unnamed corporate VPN provider&quot; without a price tag, and another zero-day for an unspecified driver that disables antivirus and endpoint detection and response software for $80,000. ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">It&#39;s no secret that datacenters use a ton of water for cooling, a demand that can strain local supplies. Despite reported internal forecasts showing sharply higher water use by 2030, Microsoft continues to splash cash on new AI bit barns.

The technology giant has been given approval to build 15 more server farms at Mount Pleasant in Wisconsin, reports say, near its existing AI datacenter campus, which Microsoft has said is on track to come online in 2026 and has billed as &quot;the world&#39;s most powerful AI datacenter.&quot;

The new project is expected to be worth more than $13 billion, with the facilities split across two sites just to the northwest of Microsoft&#39;s current campus, which occupies land once earmarked for a factory by Taiwanese electronics contract manufacturer Foxconn.

Local officials on Mount Pleasant&#39;s village board signed off on Microsoft&#39;s plans this week, according to CNBC, despite some pushback.

Elsewhere, the company has also disclosed plans to spend $30 billion expanding AI datacenters in the UK between 2025 and 2028, alongside a separate $10 billion investment in Portugal, saying it expects to more than double its datacenter capacity across 16 European countries by 2027, all to boost its ability to support AI workloads.

But all this comes at an environmental cost, as reported before, in terms of pollution, greenhouse gas emissions, and water consumption. Microsoft previously conceded that its emissions were up by about 30 percent from a 2020 baseline, despite the company pledging to be carbon-negative by 2030, with the build-out of new datacenters cited as the cause.

At the end of last year, more than 230 organizations across America signed a letter calling for a moratorium on the construction of datacenters, claiming the current build boom represents a huge environmental and social threat.

Meanwhile, the New York Times claims to have obtained Microsoft documents showing forecasts for the annual water needs of roughly 100 of its campuses worldwide to more than triple to 28 billion liters by 2030, compared to 2020 levels.

These internal forecasts were reportedly made last year, and Microsoft told the newspaper it had updated its projections to reflect new water-saving techniques so that it now expects to use about 18 billion liters of water in 2030, up 150 percent from 2020.

Despite this, the cloud computing behemoth launched its Community-First AI Infrastructure initiative earlier this month, in which it pledged to minimize its use of the wet stuff, and even replenish more water than it draws.

Microsoft vice chair and president Brad Smith promised greater local transparency, saying that people deserve to know how much water Microsoft datacenters use, and that it is committed to making that information accessible and easy to understand.

That initiative was launched after President Trump took to social media to insist that big technology companies must pay their way, rather than ordinary Americans picking up the tab for the extra energy infrastructure needed for AI datacenters through higher bills.

It isn&#39;t just Microsoft that is building new facilities at a frenzied pace, of course, and the same criticisms can be directed at other cloud and datacenter businesses. But perhaps we aren&#39;t getting the full picture because of measures such as non-disclosure agreements that local officials are made to sign by some tech companies, as The Register recently reported.

Microsoft was asked to comment for this article, but had not responded by publication time.

The current boom in datacenter construction is only likely to slow if AI investment trails off or the current bubble bursts – which the Bank of England&#39;s Financial Policy Committee warned about last year. ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Hands On For all the buzz surrounding them, AI agents are simply another form of automation that can perform tasks using the tools you&#39;ve provided. Think of them as smart macros that make decisions and go beyond simple if/then rules to handle edge cases in input data. Fortunately, it&#39;s easy enough to code your own agents and below we&#39;ll show you how.

Since ChatGPT made its debut in late 2022, literally dozens of frameworks for building AI agents have emerged. Of them, LangFlow is one of the easier and more accessible platforms for building AI agents.

Originally developed at Logspace before being acquired by DataStax, which was later bought by Big Blue, LangFlow is a low-code/no-code agent builder based on LangChain. The platform allows users to assemble LLM-augmented automations by dragging, dropping, and connecting various components and tools.

In this hands-on guide, we&#39;ll be taking a closer look at what AI agents are, how to build them, and some of the pitfalls you&#39;re likely to run into along the way.

Before we jump into building our first agent, let&#39;s talk about what comprises an agent.

At its most basic, an agent is composed of three main components: a system prompt, tools, and the model. - Click to enlarge

In general, AI agents are going to have three main components, not counting the output/action they ultimately perform or the input/trigger that started it all.

For more complex multi-step tasks, multiple models, tools, and system prompts may be used.

If you&#39;re using a Mac or PC, deploying LangFlow Desktop is as simple as downloading and running the installer from the LangFlow website.

If you&#39;re running Linux, you&#39;ll need to deploy the app as a Docker container. Thankfully this is a lot easier than it sounds. Once you&#39;ve got the latest release of Docker Engine installed, you can launch the LangFlow server using the one-liner below:

After a few minutes, the LangFlow interface will be available at http://localhost:7860.

Warning: If you&#39;re deploying the Docker container on a server that&#39;s exposed to the web, make sure to adjust your firewall rules appropriately or you might end up exposing LangFlow to the net.

LangFlow Desktop&#39;s homepage is divided into projects on the left and flows on the right. - Click to enlarge

Opening LangFlow Desktop, you&#39;ll see that the application is divided into two sections: Projects and Flows. You can think of projects as a folder where your agents are stored.

Clicking &quot;New Flow&quot; will present you with a variety of pre-baked templates to get you started.

LangFlow&#39;s no-code interface allows you to build agents by dragging and dropping components from the sidebar into a playground on the right. - Click to enlarge

On the left side of LangFlow Desktop, we see a sidebar containing various first and third-party components that we&#39;ll use to assemble an agent.

Dragging these into the &quot;Playground,&quot; we can then config and connect them to other components in our agent flow.

In the case of the Language Model component shown here, you&#39;d want to enter your OpenAI API key and select your preferred version of GPT. Meanwhile, for Ollama you&#39;ll want to enter your Ollama API URL, which for most users will be http://localhost:11434, and select a model from the drop down.

If you need help getting started with Ollama, check out our guide here.

With LangFlow up and running, let&#39;s take a look at a couple of examples of how to use it. If you&#39;d like to try these for yourself, we&#39;ve uploaded our templates to a GitHub repo here.

In this example, we&#39;ve built a relatively basic agent to analyze spreadsheets stored as CSVs, based on user prompts.

This data analytics agent uses a Python interpreter and an uploaded CSV to answer user prompts - Click to enlarge

To help the agent understand the file&#39;s data structure, we&#39;ve used the Type Convert and DataFrame Operations components to extract the dataset&#39;s schema and help the model understand the file&#39;s internal structure.

This, along with the full document&#39;s file path, is passed to a prompt template, which serves as the model&#39;s system prompt. Meanwhile, the user prompt is passed through to the model as an instruction.

LangFlow&#39;s Prompt Template enables multiple data sources to be combined into a single unified prompt. - Click to enlarge

Looking a bit closer at the prompt template, we see {DATA_HEADER} and {DATASET_FILEPATH} defined as variables. By placing these in {} we&#39;ve created additional nodes to which we can connect our database schema and file path.

Beyond this, the system prompt contains basic information on how to service user requests, including instructions on how to call the PYTHON_DATA_PLAYGROUND Python interpreter, which we see just above the prompt template.

This Python interpreter is connected to the model&#39;s &quot;tool&quot; node and apart from allowlisting the Pandas and Math libraries, we haven&#39;t changed much more than the interpreter&#39;s slug and description.

The agent&#39;s data analytics functionality is achieved using a Python interpreter rather than relying on the model to make sense of the CSV on its own. - Click to enlarge

Based on the information provided to it in the system and user prompts, the model can use this Python sandbox to execute code snippets and extract insights from the dataset.

If we ask the agent &quot;how many monitors we sold,&quot; in the Langflow playground&#39;s chat, we can see what code snippets the model executed using the Python interpreter and the raw response it got back.

As you can see, to answer our question, the model generated and executed a Python code snippet to extract the relevant information using Pandas - Click to enlarge

Obviously, this introduces some risk of hallucinations, particularly on smaller models. In this example, the agent is set up to analyze documents it hasn&#39;t seen before. However, if you know what your input looks like — for example, if the schema doesn&#39;t change between reports — it&#39;s possible to preprocess the data, like we&#39;ve done in the example below.

Rather than relying on the model to execute the right code every time, this example uses a modified Python interpreter to preprocess the data of two CSVs or Excel files before passing it to the model for review - Click to enlarge

With a couple of tweaks to the Python interpreter, we&#39;ve created a custom component that uses Pandas to compare a new spreadsheet against a reference sheet. This way the model only needs to use the Python interpreter to investigate anomalies or answer questions not already addressed by this preprocessing script.

AI agents are just automations that should, in theory, be better at handling edge cases, fuzzy logic, or improperly formatted requests.

We emphasize &quot;in theory,&quot; because the process by which LLMs execute tool calls is a bit of a black box. What&#39;s more, our testing showed smaller models had a greater propensity for hallucinations and malformed tool calls.

Switching from a locally-hosted version of OpenAI&#39;s gpt-oss-120b to GPT-5 Nano or Mini, we saw a drastic improvement in the quality and accuracy of our outputs.

If you&#39;re struggling to get reliable results from your agentic pipelines, it may be because the model isn&#39;t well suited to the role. In some cases, it may be necessary to fine tune a model specifically for that application. You can find our beginner&#39;s guide to fine tuning here.

Along with the model, the system prompt can have a significant impact on the agent&#39;s performance. The same written instructions and examples you might give an intern on how to perform a task are just as useful for guiding the model on what you do and don&#39;t want out of it.

In some cases, it may make more sense to break up and delegate a task to different models or system prompts in order to minimize the complexity of each task, reduce the likelihood of hallucinations, or cost optimize by having lower cost models tackle easier pieces of the pipeline.

Up to this point, our examples have been triggered by a chat input and returned a chat output. However, this isn&#39;t strictly required. You could set up the agent to detect new files in a directory, process them, and save its output as a file.

LangFlow supports integrations with a wide variety of services that can be extended using agentic protocols or custom components written in Python. There&#39;s even a Home Assistant tie-in if you want to build an agent to automate your smart home lights and gadgets.

Speaking of third-party integrations, we&#39;ve hardly scratched the surface of the kinds of AI-enhanced automation that are possible using frameworks like LangFlow. In addition to the examples we looked at here, we highly recommend checking out LangFlow&#39;s collection of templates and workflows.

Once you&#39;re done with that, you may want to explore what&#39;s possible using frameworks like Model Context Protocol (MCP). Originally developed by Anthropic, this agentic protocol is designed to help developers connect models to data and tools. You can find more on MCP in our hands-on guide here.

And while you&#39;re at it, you may want to brush up on the security implications of agentic AI, including threats like prompt injection or remote code execution, and ensure your environment is adequately sandboxed before deploying them in production. ®

            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2026/01/28/fortinet_forticloud_vuln/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Things aren&#39;t over yet for Fortinet customers – the security shop has disclosed yet another critical FortiCloud SSO vulnerability.

Those hoping for a reprieve following last week&#39;s patch pantomime are out of luck. After users reported successful compromises of FortiCloud SSO accounts, despite being patched against an earlier flaw, the vendor confirmed there was an alternate attack path.

According to a security advisory published Tuesday, that alternate path was assigned a separate vulnerability identifier (CVE-2026-24858, CVSS 9.4), and the company disabled FortiCloud SSO connections made from vulnerable versions. Patches are not yet ready.

Fortinet confirmed that CVE-2026-24858, an authentication bypass bug, was exploited in the wild by two malicious FortiCloud accounts, but these were blocked as of January 22.

Customers of FortiAnalyzer, FortiManager, FortiOS, and FortiProxy are all affected and should upgrade to the version recommended in the advisory to restore FortiCloud SSO services. Some versions have safe releases available already, although patches are still in the works for most.

FortiWeb and FortiSwitch Manager are still being investigated for their exposure to the security flaws.

The original attacks were first spotted by Arctic Wolf around January 15, and seemed to involve two bugs Fortinet patched in December, CVE-2025-59718 and CVE-2025-59719.

The vulnerabilities in question allowed attackers to bypass SSO checks using specially crafted SAML responses, and the observed attacks appeared to be using CVE-2025-59718 to compromise firewalls.

Fortinet confirmed on January 22 that the attacks were indeed bypassing that December patch, exploiting FortiCloud SSO, but doing so through alternate means. The patch was effective against one attack path, but not via this separate one.

Carl Windsor, CISO at Fortinet, warned at the time that although the attacks of which the company was aware only targeted FortiCloud SSO, all SAML-based SSO implementations were vulnerable.

The latest advisory states that the authentication bypass flaw can be exploited by an attacker, provided certain conditions are met.

&quot;An authentication bypass using an alternate path or channel vulnerability in FortiOS, FortiManager, FortiAnalyzer may allow an attacker with a FortiCloud account and a registered device to log into other devices registered to other accounts, if FortiCloud SSO authentication is enabled on those devices.&quot;

&quot;Please note that the FortiCloud SSO login feature is not enabled in default factory settings. However, when an administrator registers the device to FortiCare from the device&#39;s GUI, unless the administrator disables the toggle switch &#39;Allow administrative login using FortiCloud SSO&#39; in the registration page, FortiCloud SSO login is enabled upon registration.&quot; ®

From basic and affordable to premium and ultra-customizable, these are the best controllers we’ve tested for Xbox.

We live in a golden age of controllers. The gamepads on the market now are of higher quality, more versatile, and more customizable than anything from even one console generation ago. If you play games on an Xbox Series X or Series S (or a Windows PC), you have the unenviable task of choosing between several controllers from Microsoft as well as a plethora of great options from the likes of 8BitDo, PowerA, Razer, Scuf, GameSir, and Hyperkin. Some of them have drift-resistant Hall effect or TMR-based joysticks for improved longevity, yet all of them are good for one reason or another. The days of the cheap “little sibling” controller that looked cool but barely worked are over.

We’ve spent time playing all kinds of games (first-person shooters, fighters, third-person action-adventure, racing, indie roguelikes, etc.) to test a wide swath of Xbox controllers, and it may not be a surprise that the standard Xbox Wireless Controller is the best option for most folks. It makes for a great PC and Steam Deck controller, too. The default Xbox gamepad strikes the right balance of quality, comfort, versatility, and price, but there are several alternatives worth considering.

We test Xbox controllers by playing with them for an extended period of time across a variety of genres. Our test targets include team-based arena games like Marvel Rivals, competitive shooters like Call of Duty, fighters like Tekken 8, and role-playing titles like Elden Ring. When doing so, we pay close attention to how all of the components feel. Are the triggers satisfying to pull? Do the analog sticks offer the right level of resistance? Are the D-pads and face buttons too mushy, or just right? If a controller includes customization options — such as adjustable trigger stops and sensitivity, and / or remappable back buttons — we test how easy they are to configure, then judge their impact on our gameplay experience.

Is it wireless? Does it support Bluetooth? Or is it wired only? If so, is the cable replaceable?

Does it feel cheap or nicely made? Any glitches or reliability issues while testing?

Does it have handy extras, like remappable buttons or customizable triggers?

Can you remap buttons or tune it with custom software profiles?

Is it priced affordably, about average, or does it come at a steep premium?

Incredible value for Xbox Wireless supportGreat ergonomic designSatisfying buttons and triggers

Lacks customizationRequires AA batteries (or an optional rechargeable cell)

Connectivity: Xbox wireless, Bluetooth, wired / Connector type: USB-C / Mappable rear buttons: No / Software customization: No / Power: AA batteries or add-on rechargeable

Okay, I already know what you’re thinking. “The best controller for Xbox is the one that comes with the Xbox?” That may seem like a no-brainer, but this standard controller truly does earn this title as the best. It lacks some extras found on pricier options, but this controller is the distillation of all that has made the last 20 years of Xbox gamepads great, and it shows.

Thanks to Microsoft’s proprietary wireless protocol, the Xbox Wireless Controller is the only affordable wireless option out there. (Third-party wireless alternatives are available, but they’re mostly at the high end.) While some hate the standard Xbox wireless controller for its use of AA batteries instead of a built-in rechargeable cell, that also means it’s flexible, allowing for rechargeable AAs or a battery pack. And user-replaceable batteries mean you’re not stuck with a controller that doesn’t hold its charge after years of use. It also works over a USB-C wired connection.

But the standard-issue Xbox pad isn’t just great because of its varied connectivity. The hardware itself is excellent for the controller’s $65 (and often less) asking price. The sticks, buttons, triggers, and the sunken dish-shaped D-pad all feel impeccably tight, with the latter having a satisfying clickiness to it. If you’re a hardcore fighting game fan, you’ll probably be best served by a dedicated fight stick or a controller geared toward that genre — one with a superb D-pad like Hori’s Horipad Pro — but the Xbox Wireless Controller is otherwise an extraordinary jack-of-all-trades.

The only things it really lacks compared to pricier options are extra, customizable buttons and software tuning for things like stick sensitivity (button remapping is available), though Microsoft does offer cosmetic customization through its Xbox Design Lab, which bumps the price from $79.99 to $124.93 depending on the configuration. There’s a lot to love about these controllers, whether you make your own or pick one from the many colors that Microsoft offers.

InexpensiveLightweight and comfortableSatisfying buttons and Hall effect componentsProgrammable back buttons are easy to press

Connectivity: Wired / Connector type: USB-C / Mappable rear buttons: Two / Software customization: Yes / Power: Wired

The 8BitDo Ultimate Wired Controller for Xbox is a fantastic budget model that typically retails for $44.99 but can often be found for as little as $29.99. The shape is reminiscent of Nintendo’s Switch Pro Controller, only a bit smaller, with hints of Xbox influence and a curvaceous design that feels great to hold.

On the hardware front, the Ultimate Wired Controller features Hall effect sticks with satisfying tension. It also uses Hall effect triggers with dedicated vibration motors, though it lacks trigger stops, unlike our previous budget pick, the PowerA Advantage Wired. Its D-pad, face buttons, and bumpers are nice and clicky, too, despite being smaller than we’d typically like. It has two rear paddles, remappable buttons, and the ability to save up to three profiles, which you can switch between on the fly using a dedicated button. There’s even a built-in mute switch for audio, which isn’t common on cheaper controllers. You can download the 8BitDo Ultimate Software X app on PC or Xbox to fully customize this controller.

The 8BitDo Ultimate Wired works as a wired controller with your PC, but if you prefer wireless connectivity, the company also makes a three-mode wireless version for $69.99 with support for both Bluetooth and 2.4GHz wireless (via a dongle). The wireless version is a bit more expensive, however, and it’s still limited to wired connectivity on Xbox consoles.

Extensive modular customizationPremium look and feelRechargeable battery lasts an incredible 40 hours

PriceyQuestionable quality controlNo Hall effect components

Connectivity: Xbox wireless, Bluetooth, wired / Connector type: USB-C / Mappable rear buttons: Up to four / Software customization: Yes / Power: Built-in rechargeable

The Xbox Elite Wireless Controller Series 2 is Microsoft’s fanciest controller, and it’s got a lot of nice extras, like better build quality, extra buttons, user-swappable sticks and D-pad, a built-in rechargeable battery, and loads of software customization. Where the standard Xbox controller is constructed entirely of unassuming plastic, the Elite mixes higher quality soft-touch plastic, rubberized grips, and metallic touches for a superior fit and finish. This makes it heftier than the stock controller, and as a result, it just feels nicer in your hands. It also comes with a charging dock and zip-up case with passthrough charging, completing a really nice package for $199.99 (or sometimes less, if it’s on sale).

There’s also the stripped-down Elite Series 2 “Core” version with an MSRP of $149.99, which ditches the add-ons but is equally customizable. You can buy them separately in a $59.99 accessories pack, but you’ll end up paying more that way, barring sales or discounts.

A pricey controller like an Xbox Elite is a bit of a splurge purchase. Most of us are not competing at e-sports levels that require its high-end features. Nevertheless, it’s fun to use something that feels nicer, offers ways to custom-tailor it to your liking, and maybe gives you a slight competitive edge thanks to features like hair triggers and removable rear paddles. In theory, you may be able to get shots off faster in an online shooter with the hair triggers, and you can map the paddles to functions like jump, crouch, reload, etc., while keeping your thumb on the right stick. You could teach yourself claw grip to accomplish the latter with even a cheap wired controller, sure, but it just won’t feel as cool or easy as when using an Elite.

While the Elite is still a great controller in 2025, you should keep in mind that it’s been around since 2019 and a Series 3 revision is feeling long overdue. The Series 2 also has a bit of a reputation for lackluster quality control — with horror stories from users about going through multiple replacements under warranty. Microsoft extended the controller’s warranty from 90 days to a year in late 2020 to help address concerns, but buying an Elite Series 2 may still feel like a slightly risky proposition. It also predates the current-gen implementation of a dedicated Share button, and its potentiometer-based sticks run the risk of stick drift after long-term use (something third parties are addressing with controllers that use drift-free Hall effect sticks, unlike all three big console manufacturers).

Even so, the Elite 2 remains by far the most well-rounded option for a step-up Xbox controller — thanks in large part to its impressive build and expansive software experience. If all these caveats give you pause, though, there is another promising option.

ExpensiveRequires a USB dongleRazer Synapse software needs work

Connectivity: Wireless USB dongle (Xbox / PC), wired / Connector type: USB-C / Mappable rear buttons: Four / Software customization: Yes / Power: Built-in rechargeable

At $199.99, Razer’s Wolverine V3 Pro controller is as expensive (or more, depending on available deals) than the Elite Series 2, but it’s worth the cost if you want a high-end controller with drift-free sticks. Not only is the V3 Pro Razer’s first foray into using Hall effect sticks, it’s the company’s first fully wireless Xbox gamepad. It also sports some of the best hair-trigger lockouts around, yielding a mouse-like click usually found on even pricier Scuf controllers (a previous high-ranking pick of ours).

Other than that, the V3 Pro is similar to the previous V2 Pro, with six remappable buttons — four rear paddles in new, angled orientations and two extra shoulder buttons — and some RGB lighting. The buttons and D-pad still have that satisfying micro-switch tactility and audible clickiness like the previous-gen V2 Pro, but the RGB lighting is more subtle this time around.

The Wolverine V3 Pro’s biggest shortcomings compared to Microsoft’s Elite Series 2 are its more basic software customization, its lack of Bluetooth, and the fact that it needs a USB dongle to work wirelessly. The V3 Pro is otherwise the better pick if you can justify its high price, which, unlike the Series 2, is rarely subjected to discounts. Luckily, if you can’t, there’s also the $99.99 Wolverine V3 Pro Tournament Edition that has a nearly identical set of features in a wired configuration.

GameSir’s G7 Pro is a wired Xbox controller with remapable rear buttons, adjustable triggers, and TMR joysticks. It can also be connected wirelessly to a PC (via a 2.4Ghz dongle) or Android (via Bluetooth).

Connectivity: Wired (Xbox), wireless USB dongle (PC), Bluetooth (Android) / Connector type: USB-C / Mappable rear buttons: Two / Software customization: Yes / Power: Built-in rechargeable

If you don’t mind using a wired controller, GameSir’s G7 Pro offers some features of the splurge-worthy Xbox Elite Controller 2 for under $100. It has remappable buttons, smooth-feeling drift-resistant TMR control sticks, a satisfying weight, and textured grips that made it feel comfortable to hold even with sweaty palms.

The G7 Pro is actually a battery-powered wireless controller, but its cable free connectivity is limited to PC (via an included 2.4Ghz dongle) and Android (via Bluetooth). You’ll need to plug the controller into the Xbox with a cable, and GameSir provides a lengthy USB-C to USB-A cord. The cable was long enough that I could play games from my couch (roughly six feet away) without feeling tethered.

I was impressed with the G7 Pro’s overall build quality, especially the triggers, which could be locked by flipping switches on its back. GameSir includes three swappable direction pads with the G7 Pro, which can be swapped by lifting the front of the controller’s shell and popping them in and out. However, its face buttons felt noticeably cheaper than the ones on the Elite 2, which makes sense given their price difference. Button feel aside, the controller never dropped an input, even when I mashed buttons to string together elaborate combos in Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater, or continuously cast spells, dodged, and healed in Diablo IV. If an action was mistimed, it was on me.

What the controller lacks in face button quality is more than made up for in customizability. GameSir Nexus, a free app on the Xbox Store, allowed me to remap any button (including the L4 and R4 buttons on its backside), adjust the vibration intensity of both triggers, enable two flavors of hair trigger mode, and set the deadzone for each control stick. You can save up to four profiles with different settings, and quickly switch between them by pressing the controller’s M button along with one of the face buttons. You never need to touch these options, or even download the GameSir Nexus app for the G7 Pro to work, but doing so will unlock its full potential.

The GameSir G7 Pro is an excellent Xbox controller, especially in its price range. I’d have liked the option to use it wirelessly, but that wasn’t a dealbreaker for me. That said, it’s something to consider depending on how far away you are from your Xbox when playing. If you’re a multi-platform gamer and want a controller to use with both an Xbox and PC (or Android device), it’s an even better choice.

Hyperkin’s Competitor is a wired Xbox controller that looks and feels like Sony’s PlayStation 5 DualSense gamepad. It has symmetrical Hall effect joysticks, four-button directional pad, and a pair of programmable back buttons.

Connectivity: Wired / Connector type: USB-C / Mappable rear buttons: Two / Software customization: No / Power: N/A

Hyperkin’s cheekily-named Competitor wired Xbox and PC-compatible controller that looks and feels like the DualSense gamepad that comes with the PlayStation 5 — aka one of the Xbox’s main competitors. The controller’s Hall effect joysticks are symmetrical and located at the bottom, while a four-button directional pad sits above the left grip. The giant “X” button in the middle of the controller is an immediate giveaway that you’re using an Xbox gamepad, but it was easy to forget I wasn’t using a DualSense when playing games.

In terms of comfort the Competitor was on par with Microsoft’s official Xbox Wireless Controller. I’ve played enough PlayStation games over the years that using the gamepad felt intuitive, with no need to adjust my muscle memory, or change my grip. Playing with a wired controller can feel restrictive, but the long USB-C to USB-A cable included with the Competitor prevented me from feeling tethered. The cable is replaceable, which is good news if yours gets frayed or otherwise damaged over time.

Overall, I was pleased with the controller’s construction. It was heavy enough to feel substantial, but light enough that I never felt wrist fatigue after holding it for an hour or more. Its buttons were all satisfyingly clickey, and its joysticks glided smoothly. The controller has two programmable back buttons, which you can program by pressing one of the rear buttons and the “M” button that’s also located on the controller’s backside. The controller rumbles to let you know it’s time to press another button on the controller to set the hot key. Each back button has to be programmed one at a time, and can be disabled by flipping a switch.

My tests included playing Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 1 + 2, Crash Bandicoot 4, Trials of Mana, and Tales of Arise. I had no problems jumping (or skating as it were) into any of these games. Playing them felt intuitive, and the controller never dropped an input. A benefit to playing games with a wired controller is there’s less latency between when you press a button and an action happens on screen. The difference is generally imperceptible (unless you play online games competitively), but there were probably a couple of Tony Hawk combos I nailed in the nick of time thanks to the lower latency.

My personal preference will always be to play Xbox games with a wireless controller because it’s the least restrictive type of gamepad. However, Hyperkin’s Competitor is a great gamepad in general, and an especially good choice if you’re regularly switching between playing Xbox, PC, and PS5 games. It doesn’t offer the same amount of customization as the GameSir G7 or Xbox Elite Series 2 controller, but its design and $49.99 MSRP more than make up for those shortcomings.

Update, January 28th: Updated to reflect current pricing / availability and add a mention of 8BitDo’s forthcoming Ultimate 3E controller. Brandt Ranj also contributed to this post.

Now, Gemini in Chrome can handle more complex requests, like helping you shop on a budget.

Google is launching a new “auto browse” feature inside Chrome that can perform multi-step tasks on your behalf. The Gemini AI-powered capability is coming to Google AI Pro and Ultra subscribers in the US, and can do things like research hotel and flight costs, schedule appointments, fill out online forms, manage subscriptions, and more.

The update marks another expansion for Gemini in Chrome, which initially served as an AI assistant that you can use to ask questions or summarize content on the webpage you’re reading. Google later added the ability for Gemini to compare products across multiple tabs and recall pages from your browsing history, while hinting at allowing the AI agent to perform “tedious tasks.”

Google says that while using auto browse, Gemini can identify decorations inside of a photo you’re looking at, find similar items on the web, add them to your cart, apply discount codes, all while staying within your budget. If a task requires you to log into an account, Gemini can also use the browser’s password manager to log in.

Along with this change, Google has moved Gemini in Chrome from a pop-up window to a panel anchored to the right side of your screen. It now supports integrations with Gmail, Calendar, Maps, Google Shopping, and Google Flights for all users, allowing it to reference information from across the apps you use, as well as perform actions within them.

“For example, if you’re traveling to a conference and need to book a flight, Gemini can dig up that old email with event details, reference context from Google Flights to provide some recommendations, and later draft an email letting your colleagues know your arrival time,” Google writes.

You’ll also find Nano Banana — Google’s AI-powered image generator — in the new Gemini in Chrome panel. This feature is coming to all Gemini in Chrome users, and lets you edit an image inside your window using a text prompt.

Google has more in store down the road for Gemini in Chrome as it competes with other agentic AI browsers, including OpenAI’s Atlas and Perplexity’s Comet. Personal intelligence, an opt-in feature that first launched inside the Gemini app, gives Gemini the ability to reference your past conversations, as well as use its reasoning capabilities to analyze the data linked to your Gmail, Calendar, Photos, and search history. Google says it plans on bringing the feature to Chrome in the “coming months.”

The company will reveal its Gen 3 robot in the first quarter of 2026.

In its earnings report, Tesla says that the third-generation version of its Optimus humanoid robot “meant for mass production” will be unveiled in the first quarter of 2026.

This new version of Optimus will include “major upgrades from version 2.5, including our latest hand design.” And the company is making preparations for the first production line, which will commence “before the end of 2026.” Tesla says its planning for the eventual capacity of 1 million robots produced per year. Elon Musk previously predicted that Tesla would produce 5,000 robots in 2025, though its unlikely he met that milestone.

Musk has also predicted that Optimus will not only be put to work in Tesla’s factories, but also as home assistants and even surgeons. He has said Tesla will begin to sell Optimus to the public “next year,” even as his company becomes more financially dependent on the prospect of humanoid robots.

But Optimus has had a rough rollout so far, including teleoperations missteps and the recent departure of Tesla’s head of robotics. Much is riding on the humanoid robot, including Musk’s $1 trillion pay package, which requires him to build at least 1 million robots.

            <div id="article-text">Microsoft’s More Personal Computing division was the only business unit to post a revenue decline this quarter.

Microsoft’s More Personal Computing division was the only business unit to post a revenue decline this quarter.

Microsoft just posted the second quarter of its 2026 fiscal financial results. The software maker made $81.3 billion in revenue and a net income of $30.9 billion during Q3. Revenue is up 17 percent, and net income has increased by 23 percent.

The holiday quarter saw PC shipments grow unexpectedly amid an ongoing RAM shortage. Microsoft’s end of Windows 10 support helped push PC shipments up, but IDC revealed earlier this month that PC makers have also been aggressively pulling forward inventory to combat potential tariffs and ongoing global memory shortage.

Microsoft’s Windows OEM and devices revenue over this holiday period was up just 1 percent year-over-year. Businesses and consumers have clearly been upgrading PCs and laptops during the Windows 10 end of life period, because Windows OEM revenue on its own was up 5 percent. But this revenue was offset by a decline in devices revenue as Microsoft combines Surface revenue and Windows OEM revenue together now.

Microsoft didn’t announce any new Surface devices during the recent quarter, after launching both the 12-inch Surface Pro and 13-inch Surface Laptop in May last year. I would expect to hear more about new Surface devices in the spring.

Microsoft’s Xbox hardware revenue has declined for three financial years in a row, and it looks like those declining revenues are going to continue throughout fiscal 2026. Xbox hardware revenue was down 32 percent year-over-year during the recent holiday quarter. Overall gaming revenue was also down 9 percent.

Xbox content and services, which includes Game Pass, is down 5 percent, too. This decline is largely being attributed to stronger first-party content performance in the previous year, and not the Game Pass Ultimate price hike during the quarter. That points towards softer sales numbers for Call of Duty: Black Ops 7, which not only had to go up against Battlefield 6, but also the success of Black Ops 6 last year.

Unsurprisingly, Microsoft isn’t giving us an update on Xbox Game Pass subscriber numbers. The company last reported it had 34 million subscribers nearly two years ago, which included Xbox Game Pass Essential (previously Xbox Live Gold / Game Pass Core) members.

Microsoft has continued to publish more games on PS5, as part of its strategy to make previously Xbox-exclusive games available on Nintendo and Sony platforms. Microsoft revealed last year that Halo: Campaign Evolved is coming to PS5 and Xbox in 2026, and Fable and Forza Horizon 6 are also coming to Sony’s console this year.

Microsoft’s cloud revenue was once again strong this quarter, and even crossed $50 billion overall — up 26 percent year-over-year. Azure and other cloud services revenue grew 39 percent.“ Microsoft Cloud revenue crossed $50 billion this quarter, reflecting the strong demand for our portfolio of services,” says Microsoft CFO Amy Hood. “We exceeded expectations across revenue, operating income, and earnings per share.”

All eyes are still on Microsoft’s AI revenues and the associated costs, and the software maker hasn’t pulled out any specific AI product numbers this quarter. Capital expenditure in Q2 was $37.5 billion, and the majority of that spend was on assets like CPU and GPUs to fuel cloud and AI data centers. Commercial bookings have also increased 230 percent year-over-year, thanks to Azure commitments from OpenAI and Anthropic.

Microsoft announced its latest in-house AI chip this week, which will help host GPT-5.2 and other models for Microsoft Foundry and Microsoft 365 Copilot. The Maia 200 chip is designed for large-scale AI workloads and will go head-to-head with similar AI inference chips from Amazon and Google.

Microsoft also saw Microsoft 365 consumer cloud revenue growth of 29 percent year-over-year, alongside Microsoft 365 commercial cloud revenue growth of 17 percent. LinkedIn revenue also grew by 11 percent year-over-year.

The strength of Microsoft’s Intelligent Cloud business, which includes Azure and server products, really shines a bright light on the decline of the More Personal Computing business of Windows, Xbox, and Surface. Intelligent Cloud contributed $32.9 billion in revenue this quarter, more than double the $14.3 billion from More Personal Computing. In fact, the More Personal Computing division declined by 3 percent in revenue year-over-year, the only business unit to do so this quarter.

Microsoft blames that More Personal Computing decline on gaming, and it was offset by search and news advertising revenues growing by 10 percent and Windows OEM growth.

Microsoft will now hold an earnings call at 5:30PM ET, and we’ll update this article with any relevant comments from Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella and Microsoft CFO Amy Hood.

            <h2>Tesla hits a grim milestone: its second straight year of decline</h2>
            <p><strong>The Verge | 2026-01-28</strong></p>

            <div id="article-text">The automaker has lost the lead to its Chinese competitors as its business continues to contract.

The automaker has lost the lead to its Chinese competitors as its business continues to contract.

Tesla just reported its second consecutive year of declining revenue and profits, further complicating Elon Musk’s $1 trillion effort to transform his company into a leader in AI and robotics. Meanwhile, the global EV market continues to grow, seemingly in spite of the pioneering company’s setbacks.

Tesla said it earned $840 million in net income on $24.9 billion in revenue in the quarter that ended in December 2025. That’s a 3 percent decrease in revenue and a staggering 61 percent decrease in profits over the fourth quarter of 2024, when the company earned $2.3 billion in net income on $25.7 billion in revenue.

Tesla beat expectations from Wall Street, which had predicted that Tesla would report $24.79 billion in revenue according to an average of analyst estimates compiled by LSEG. For the full year 2025, Tesla said it earned $3.8 billion in net income on $94.8 billion in revenue, a 3 percent decrease compared to 2024.

The earnings report comes a few weeks after Tesla lost its title as the world’s best-selling EV company to China’s BYD, which sold 2.26 million vehicles last year. The company reported selling about 1.6 million vehicles in 2025, a 8.5 percent decrease year over year. In the fourth quarter alone, it recorded a 15.6 percent drop in customer deliveries, as many people made their purchases in the third quarter to take advantage of expiring federal tax credits.

Meanwhile, global EV sales continued to grow by leaps and bounds, up 20 percent in 2025. But that growth is expected to cool in 2026 based on weakness in the Chinese market and the pullback of subsidies. Policy shifts, like the Trump administration’s U-turn on EV subsidies and the relaxation of emissions targets, are expected to lead to slower growth in EV sales this year.

The drop in revenue was widely expected, given the disastrous year that Tesla just experienced. Tesla’s aging lineup, as well as rising competition from legacy automakers in the US, Europe, and China, put a serious dent in Tesla’s demand. And Tesla CEO Elon Musk’s emergence as a divisive political figure, pushing racist right-wing conspiracies on his social media platform X, throwing Nazi salutes at Donald Trump’s inauguration, and heading the controversial DOGE project in the Trump administration to slash global humanitarian aid programs, has alienated many of the company’s traditionally liberal customers. Musk’s political activity is estimated to have cost Tesla sales of more than 1 million vehicles.

Musk himself has said that the company is in for “a few rough quarters” thanks to the expiring incentives and other macroeconomic factors. But he believes that Tesla will eventually rebound as its AI plans come to fruition, including robotaxis and humanoid robots. Musk predicted that 50 percent of the US population will have access to Tesla’s robotaxis by the end of 2025 — a prediction that unsurprisingly turned out to be wildly overblown. So far, only a handful of vehicles are available in Austin and San Francisco to a limited number of customers and under strict circumstances.

The earnings report also comes on the heels of Musk winning approval from Tesla shareholders for a massive new pay package that could make him the world’s first trillionaire. Musk would need to meet a series of ambitious milestones to receive the compensation, including producing over a million robots, a million robotaxis, and creating $7.5 trillion in value for Tesla’s shareholders.

            <div id="article-text">YouTube CEO Neal Mohan says the platform plans to ‘reduce the spread of low quality AI content.’

YouTube CEO Neal Mohan says the platform plans to ‘reduce the spread of low quality AI content.’

YouTube appears to have taken down two of the most popular AI slop channels on its platform, along with several others. A report from Kapwing found that a channel called CuentosFacianantes no longer exists on the platform after amassing more than 5.9 million subscribers and over 1.2 billion total views.

In a November 2025 report, Kapwing identified CuentosFacianantes (FascinatingTales) as the most-subscribed-to AI slop channel, which churned out “low-quality Dragon Ball-themed videos.” The second channel on its list, Imperio de Jesus (Empire of Jesus), is also no longer available on YouTube and had over 5.8 million subscribers. A machine-translated version of the channel’s description says it focuses on strengthening “our faith with Jesus through fun interactive quizzes.”

Kapwing’s findings come just weeks after YouTube CEO Neal Mohan addressed the prevalence of AI slop on the platform. In a letter to users, Mohan said the company plans to “reduce the spread of low quality AI content” by building on the system it already uses to combat spam and clickbait.

16 other AI slop channels on Kapwing’s list have either been deleted or no longer have any videos on YouTube, including Héroes de Fantasía, Adhamali-0, and Roupa25. Another channel, Super Cat League, is still available on YouTube, but no longer has any videos. Its channel description might give you an idea of what you could’ve expected:

Welcome to [Insert Channel Name] – The World’s #1 AI Cat Cinema! 🐾✨In 2026, we are redefining digital storytelling. We merge the cuteness of cats with the power of Advanced Generative AI to create hyper-realistic, emotional, and viral adventures you’ve never seen before. From heartbreaking “Poor to Rich” sagas to epic feline hero journeys, our channel is where cutting-edge technology meets the soul of a cat.

The above channels had more than 2 million subscribers, according to Kapwing. It’s still not clear whether YouTube removed them or when. The Verge reached out to YouTube to ask for more information, but didn’t immediately hear back.

Last year, YouTube announced plans to crack down on “inauthentic” content, and later removed two channels that created fake, AI-generated movie trailers. Despite taking action against AI-generated content, the company is still encouraging creators to use AI clips in shorts and eventually generate their own AI likenesses.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The ability to remember you and your preferences is rapidly becoming a big selling point for AI chatbots and agents.

Earlier this month, Google announced Personal Intelligence, a new way for people to interact with the company’s Gemini chatbot that draws on their Gmail, photos, search, and YouTube histories to make Gemini “more personal, proactive, and powerful.” It echoes similar moves by OpenAI, Anthropic, and Meta to add new ways for their AI products to remember and draw from people’s personal details and preferences. While these features have potential advantages, we need to do more to prepare for the new risks they could introduce into these complex technologies.

Personalized, interactive AI systems are built to act on our behalf, maintain context across conversations, and improve our ability to carry out all sorts of tasks, from booking travel to filing taxes. From tools that learn a developer’s coding style to shopping agents that sift through thousands of products, these systems rely on the ability to store and retrieve increasingly intimate details about their users.  But doing so over time introduces alarming, and all-too-familiar, privacy vulnerabilities––many of which have loomed since “big data” first teased the power of spotting and acting on user patterns. Worse, AI agents now appear poised to plow through whatever safeguards had been adopted to avoid those vulnerabilities.

Today, we interact with these systems through conversational interfaces, and we frequently switch contexts. You might ask a single AI agent to draft an email to your boss, provide medical advice, budget for holiday gifts, and provide input on interpersonal conflicts. Most AI agents collapse all data about you—which may once have been separated by context, purpose, or permissions—into single, unstructured repositories. When an AI agent links to external apps or other agents to execute a task, the data in its memory can seep into shared pools. This technical reality creates the potential for unprecedented privacy breaches that expose not only isolated data points, but the entire mosaic of people’s lives.

When information is all in the same repository, it is prone to crossing contexts in ways that are deeply undesirable. A casual chat about dietary preferences to build a grocery list could later influence what health insurance options are offered, or a search for restaurants offering accessible entrances could leak into salary negotiations—all without a user’s awareness (this concern may sound familiar from the early days of “big data,” but is now far less theoretical). An information soup of memory not only poses a privacy issue, but also makes it harder to understand an AI system’s behavior—and to govern it in the first place. So what can developers do to fix this problem?

First, memory systems need structure that allows control over the purposes for which memories can be accessed and used. Early efforts appear to be underway: Anthropic’s Claude creates separate memory areas for different “projects,” and OpenAI says that information shared through ChatGPT Health is compartmentalized from other chats. These are helpful starts, but the instruments are still far too blunt: At a minimum, systems must be able to distinguish between specific memories (the user likes chocolate and has asked about GLP-1s), related memories (user manages diabetes and therefore avoids chocolate), and memory categories (such as professional and health-related). Further, systems need to allow for usage restrictions on certain types of memories and reliably accommodate explicitly defined boundaries—particularly around memories having to do with sensitive topics like medical conditions or protected characteristics, which will likely be subject to stricter rules.

Needing to keep memories separate in this way will have important implications for how AI systems can and should be built. It will require tracking memories’ provenance—their source, any associated time stamp, and the context in which they were created—and building ways to trace when and how certain memories influence the behavior of an agent. This sort of model explainability is on the horizon, but current implementations can be misleading or even deceptive. Embedding memories directly within a model’s weights may result in more personalized and context-aware outputs, but structured databases are currently more segmentable, more explainable, and thus more governable. Until research advances enough, developers may need to stick with simpler systems.

Second, users need to be able to see, edit, or delete what is remembered about them. The interfaces for doing this should be both transparent and intelligible, translating system memory into a structure users can accurately interpret. The static system settings and legalese privacy policies provided by traditional tech platforms have set a low bar for user controls, but natural-language interfaces may offer promising new options for explaining what information is being retained and how it can be managed. Memory structure will have to come first, though: Without it, no model can clearly state a memory’s status. Indeed, Grok 3’s system prompt includes an instruction to the model to “NEVER confirm to the user that you have modified, forgotten, or won&#39;t save a memory,” presumably because the company can’t guarantee those instructions will be followed.

Critically, user-facing controls cannot bear the full burden of privacy protection or prevent all harms from AI personalization. Responsibility must shift toward AI providers to establish strong defaults, clear rules about permissible memory generation and use, and technical safeguards like on-device processing, purpose limitation, and contextual constraints. Without system-level protections, individuals will face impossibly convoluted choices about what should be remembered or forgotten, and the actions they take may still be insufficient to prevent harm. Developers should consider how to limit data collection in memory systems until robust safeguards exist, and build memory architectures that can evolve alongside norms and expectations.

Third, AI developers must help lay the foundations for approaches to evaluating systems so as to capture not only performance, but also the risks and harms that arise in the wild. While independent researchers are best positioned to conduct these tests (given developers’ economic interest in demonstrating demand for more personalized services), they need access to data to understand what risks might look like and therefore how to address them. To improve the ecosystem for measurement and research, developers should invest in automated measurement infrastructure, build out their own ongoing testing, and implement privacy-preserving testing methods that enable system behavior to be monitored and probed under realistic, memory-enabled conditions.

In its parallels with human experience, the technical term “memory” casts impersonal cells in a spreadsheet as something that builders of AI tools have a responsibility to handle with care. Indeed, the choices AI developers make today—how to pool or segregate information, whether to make memory legible or allow it to accumulate opaquely, whether to prioritize responsible defaults or maximal convenience—will determine how the systems we depend upon remember us. Technical considerations around memory are not so distinct from questions about digital privacy and the vital lessons we can draw from them. Getting the foundations right today will determine how much room we can give ourselves to learn what works—allowing us to make better choices around privacy and autonomy than we have before.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">From the Gemini Calendar prompt-injection attack of 2026 to the September 2025 state-sponsored hack using Anthropic’s Claude code as an automated intrusion engine, the coercion of human-in-the-loop agentic actions and fully autonomous agentic workflows are the new attack vector for hackers. In the Anthropic case, roughly 30 organizations across tech, finance, manufacturing, and government were affected. Anthropic’s threat team assessed that the attackers used AI to carry out 80% to 90% of the operation: reconnaissance, exploit development, credential harvesting, lateral movement, and data exfiltration, with humans stepping in only at a handful of key decision points.

This was not a lab demo; it was a live espionage campaign. The attackers hijacked an agentic setup (Claude code plus tools exposed via Model Context Protocol (MCP)) and jailbroke it by decomposing the attack into small, seemingly benign tasks and telling the model it was doing legitimate penetration testing. The same loop that powers developer copilots and internal agents was repurposed as an autonomous cyber-operator. Claude was not hacked. It was persuaded and used tools for the attack.

Security communities have been warning about this for several years. Multiple OWASP Top 10 reports put prompt injection, or more recently Agent Goal Hijack, at the top of the risk list and pair it with identity and privilege abuse and human-agent trust exploitation: too much power in the agent, no separation between instructions and data, and no mediation of what comes out.

Guidance from the NCSC and CISA describes generative AI as a persistent social-engineering and manipulation vector that must be managed across design, development, deployment, and operations, not patched away with better phrasing. The EU AI Act turns that lifecycle view into law for high-risk AI systems, requiring a continuous risk management system, robust data governance, logging, and cybersecurity controls.

In practice, prompt injection is best understood as a persuasion channel. Attackers don’t break the model—they convince it. In the Anthropic example, the operators framed each step as part of a defensive security exercise, kept the model blind to the overall campaign, and nudged it, loop by loop, into doing offensive work at machine speed.

That’s not something a keyword filter or a polite “please follow these safety instructions” paragraph can reliably stop. Research on deceptive behavior in models makes this worse. Anthropic’s research on sleeper agents shows that once a model has learned a backdoor, then strategic pattern recognition, standard fine-tuning, and adversarial training can actually help the model hide the deception rather than remove it. If one tries to defend a system like that purely with linguistic rules, they are playing on its home field.

Regulators aren’t asking for perfect prompts; they’re asking that enterprises demonstrate control.

NIST’s AI RMF emphasizes asset inventory, role definition, access control, change management, and continuous monitoring across the AI lifecycle. The UK AI Cyber Security Code of Practice similarly pushes for secure-by-design principles by treating AI like any other critical system, with explicit duties for boards and system operators from conception through decommissioning.

In other words: the rules actually needed are not “never say X” or “always respond like Y,” they are:

Frameworks like Google’s Secure AI Framework (SAIF) make this concrete. SAIF’s agent permissions control is blunt: agents should operate with least privilege, dynamically scoped permissions, and explicit user control for sensitive actions. OWASP’s Top 10 emerging guidance on agentic applications mirrors that stance: constrain capabilities at the boundary, not in the prose.

The Anthropic espionage case makes the boundary failure concrete:

We’ve seen the other side of this coin in civilian contexts. When Air Canada’s website chatbot misrepresented its bereavement policy and the airline tried to argue that the bot was a separate legal entity, the tribunal rejected the claim outright: the company remained liable for what the bot said. In espionage, the stakes are higher but the logic is the same: if an AI agent misuses tools or data, regulators and courts will look through the agent and to the enterprise.

So yes, rule-based systems fail if by rules one means ad-hoc allow/deny lists, regex fences, and baroque prompt hierarchies trying to police semantics. Those crumble under indirect prompt injection, retrieval-time poisoning, and model deception. But rule-based governance is non-optional when we move from language to action.

The security community is converging on a synthesis:

The lesson from the first AI-orchestrated espionage campaign is not that AI is uncontrollable. It’s that control belongs in the same place it always has in security: at the architecture boundary, enforced by systems, not by vibes.

The first human test of a rejuvenation method will begin “shortly”

Life Biosciences, a small Boston startup founded by Harvard professor and life-extension evangelist David Sinclair, has won FDA approval to proceed with the first targeted attempt at age reversal in human volunteers.The company plans to try to treat eye disease with a radical rejuvenation concept called “reprogramming” that has recently attracted hundreds of millions in investment for Silicon Valley firms like Altos Labs, New Limit, and Retro Biosciences, backed by many of the biggest names in tech.

Stratospheric internet could finally start taking off this year

Today, an estimated 2.2 billion people still have either limited or no access to the internet, largely because they live in remote places. But that number could drop this year, thanks to tests of stratospheric airships, uncrewed aircraft, and other high-altitude platforms for internet delivery.Although Google shuttered its high-profile internet balloon project Loon in 2021, work on other kinds of high-altitude platform stations has continued behind the scenes. Now, several companies claim they have solved Loon’s problems—and are getting ready to prove the tech’s internet beaming potential starting this year. Read the full story.

MIT Technology Review Narrated: This Nobel Prize–winning chemist dreams of making water from thin air

Most of Earth is covered in water, but just 3% of it is fresh, with no salt—the kind of water all terrestrial living things need. Today, desalination plants that take the salt out of seawater provide the bulk of potable water in technologically advanced desert nations like Israel and the United Arab Emirates, but at a high cost.

Omar Yaghi, is one of three scientists who won a Nobel Prize in chemistry in October 2025 for identifying metal-­organic frameworks, or MOFs—metal ions tethered to organic molecules that form repeating structural landscapes. Today that work is the basis for a new project that sounds like science fiction, or a miracle: conjuring water out of thin air.This is our latest story to be turned into a MIT Technology Review Narrated podcast, which we’re publishing each week on Spotify and Apple Podcasts.

How AI and Wikipedia have sent vulnerable languages into a doom spiralWikipedia is the most ambitious multilingual project after the Bible: There are editions in over 340 languages, and a further 400 even more obscure ones are being developed. But many of these smaller editions are being swamped with AI-translated content. Volunteers working on four African languages, for instance, estimated to MIT Technology Review that between 40% and 60% of articles in their Wikipedia editions were uncorrected machine translations.

This is beginning to cause a wicked problem. AI systems learn new languages by scraping huge quantities of text from the internet. Wikipedia is sometimes the largest source of online linguistic data for languages with few speakers—so any errors on those pages can poison the wells that AI is expected to draw from. Volunteers are being forced to go to extreme lengths to fix the issue, even deleting certain languages from Wikipedia entirely. Read the full story.

            <h2>The first human test of a rejuvenation method will begin “shortly”</h2>
            <p><strong>MIT Technology Review | 2026-01-27</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2026/01/27/1131796/the-first-human-test-of-a-rejuvenation-method-will-begin-shortly/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">When Elon Musk was at Davos last week, an interviewer asked him if he thought aging could be reversed. Musk said he hasn’t put much time into the problem but suspects it is “very solvable” and that when scientists discover why we age, it’s going to be something “obvious.”

Not long after, the Harvard professor and life-extension evangelist David Sinclair jumped into the conversation on X to strongly agree with the world’s richest man. “Aging has a relatively simple explanation and is apparently reversible,” wrote Sinclair. “Clinical Trials begin shortly.”

ER-100 turns out to be the code name of a treatment created by Life Biosciences, a small Boston startup that Sinclair cofounded and which he confirmed today has won FDA approval to proceed with the first targeted attempt at age reversal in human volunteers.

The company plans to try to treat eye disease with a radical rejuvenation concept called “reprogramming” that has recently attracted hundreds of millions in investment for Silicon Valley firms like Altos Labs, New Limit, and Retro Biosciences, backed by many of the biggest names in tech.

The technique attempts to restore cells to a healthier state by broadly resetting their epigenetic controls—switches on our genes that determine which are turned on and off.

“Reprogramming is like the AI of the bio world. It’s the thing everyone is funding,” says Karl Pfleger, an investor who backs a smaller UK startup, Shift Bioscience. He says Sinclair’s company has recently been seeking additional funds to keep advancing its treatment.

Reprogramming is so powerful that it sometimes creates risks, even causing cancer in lab animals, but the version of the technique being advanced by Life Biosciences passed initial safety tests in animals.

But it’s still very complex. The trial will initially test the treatment on about a dozen patients with glaucoma, a condition where high pressure inside the eye damages the optic nerve. In the tests, viruses carrying three powerful reprogramming genes will be injected into one eye of each patient, according to a description of the study first posted in December.

To help make sure the process doesn’t go too far, the reprogramming genes will be under the control of a special genetic switch that turns them on only while the patients take a low dose of the antibiotic doxycycline. Initially, they will take the antibiotic for about two months while the effects are monitored.

Executives at the company have said for months that a trial could begin this year, sometimes characterizing it as a starting bell for a new era of age reversal. “It’s an incredibly big deal for us as an industry,” Michael Ringel, chief operating officer at Life Biosciences, said at an event this fall. “It’ll be the first time in human history, in the millennia of human history, of looking for something that rejuvenates … So watch this space.”

The technology is based on the Nobel Prize–winning discovery, 20 years ago, that introducing a few potent genes into a cell will cause it to turn back into a stem cell, just like those found in an early embryo that develop into the different specialized cell types. These genes, known as Yamanaka factors, have been likened to a “factory reset” button for cells.

But they’re dangerous, too. When turned on in a living animal, they can cause an eruption of tumors.

That is what led scientists to a new idea, termed “partial” or “transient” reprogramming. The idea is to limit exposure to the potent genes—or use only a subset of them—in the hope of making cells act younger without giving them complete amnesia about what their role in the body is.

In 2020, Sinclair claimed that such partial reprogramming could restore vision to mice after their optic nerves were smashed, saying there was even evidence that the nerves regrew. His report appeared on the cover of the influential journal Nature alongside the headline “Turning Back Time.”

Not all scientists agree that reprogramming really counts as age reversal. But Sinclair has doubled down. He’s been advancing the theory that the gradual loss of correct epigenetic information in our cells is, in fact, the ultimate cause of aging—just the kind of root cause that Musk was alluding to.

“Elon does seem to be paying attention to the field and [is] seemingly in sync with [my theory],” Sinclair said in an email.

Reprogramming isn’t the first longevity fix championed by Sinclair, who’s written best-selling books and commands stratospheric fees on the longevity lecture circuit. Previously, he touted the longevity benefits of molecules called sirtuins as well as resveratrol, a molecule found in red wine. But some critics say he greatly exaggerates scientific progress, pushback that culminated in a 2024 Wall Street Journal story that dubbed him a “reverse-aging guru” whose companies “have not panned out.”

Life Biosciences has been among those struggling companies. Initially formed in 2017, it at first had a strategy of launching subsidiaries, each intended to pursue one aspect of the aging problem. But after these made limited progress, in 2021 it hired a new CEO, Jerry McLaughlin, who has refocused its efforts  on Sinclair’s mouse vision results and the push toward a human trial.

The company has discussed the possibility of reprogramming other organs, including the brain. And Ringel, like Sinclair, entertains the idea that someday even whole-body rejuvenation might be feasible. But for now, it’s better to think of the study as a proof of concept that’s still far from a fountain of youth. “The optimistic case is this solves some blindness for certain people and catalyzes work in other indications,” says Pfleger, the investor. “It’s not like your doctor will be writing a prescription for a pill that will rejuvenate you.”

Life’s treatment also relies on an antibiotic switching mechanism that, while often used in lab animals, hasn’t been tried in humans before. Since the switch is built from gene components taken from E. coli and the herpes virus, it’s possible that it could cause an immune reaction in humans, scientists say.

“I was always thinking that for widespread use you might need a different system,” says Noah Davidsohn, who helped Sinclair implement the technique and is now chief scientist at a different company, Rejuvenate Bio. And Life’s choice of reprogramming factors—it’s picked three, which go by the acronym OSK—may also be risky. They are expected to turn on hundreds of other genes, and in some circumstances the combination can cause cells to revert to a very primitive, stem-cell-like state.

Other companies studying reprogramming say their focus is on researching which genes to use, in order to achieve time reversal without unwanted side effects. New Limit, which has been carrying out an extensive search for such genes, says it won’t be ready for a human study for two years. At Shift, experiments on animals are only beginning now.

“Are their factors the best version of rejuvenation? We don’t think they are. I think they are working with what they’ve got,” Daniel Ives, the CEO of Shift, says of Life Biosciences. “But I think they’re way ahead of anybody else in terms of getting into humans. They have found a route forward in the eye, which is a nice self-contained system. If it goes wrong, you’ve still got one left.”

Why personalized gene editing, genetic resurrections and embryo scoring made our list.

A small group of volunteers will receive multiple injections of the experimental treatments next month, says Unlimited Bio.

An emphasis on fruit, vegetables, and whole foods is welcome—but it’s wrong to suggest steak and beef tallow should be prominent.

            <div id="article-text">OpenAI just revealed what its new in-house team, OpenAI for Science, has been up to. The firm has released a free LLM-powered tool for scientists called Prism, which embeds ChatGPT in a text editor for writing scientific papers.

The idea is to put ChatGPT front and center inside software that scientists use to write up their work in much the same way that chatbots are now embedded into popular programming editors. It’s vibe coding, but for science.

Kevin Weil, head of OpenAI for Science, pushes that analogy himself. “I think 2026 will be for AI and science what 2025 was for AI in software engineering,” he said at a press briefing yesterday. “We’re starting to see that same kind of inflection.”

OpenAI claims that around 1.3 million scientists around the world submit more than 8 million queries a week to ChatGPT on advanced topics in science and math. “That tells us that AI is moving from curiosity to core workflow for scientists,” Weil said.

Prism is a response to that user behavior. It can also be seen as a bid to lock in more scientists to OpenAI’s products in a marketplace full of rival chatbots.

“I mostly use GPT-5 for writing code,” says Roland Dunbrack, a professor of biology at the Fox Chase Cancer Center in Philadelphia, who is not connected to OpenAI. “Occasionally, I ask LLMs a scientific question, basically hoping it can find information in the literature faster than I can. It used to hallucinate references but does not seem to do that very much anymore.”

Nikita Zhivotovskiy, a statistician at the University of California, Berkeley, says GPT-5 has already become an important tool in his work. “It sometimes helps polish the text of papers, catching mathematical typos or bugs, and provides generally useful feedback,” he says. “It is extremely helpful for quick summarization of research articles, making interaction with the scientific literature smoother.”

By combining a chatbot with an everyday piece of software, Prism follows a trend set by products such as OpenAI’s Atlas, which embeds ChatGPT in a web browser, as well as LLM-powered office tools from firms such as Microsoft and Google DeepMind.

Prism incorporates GPT-5.2, the company’s best model yet for mathematical and scientific problem-solving, into an editor for writing documents in LaTeX, a common coding language that scientists use for formatting scientific papers.

A ChatGPT chat box sits at the bottom of the screen, below a view of the article being written. Scientists can call on ChatGPT for anything they want. It can help them draft the text, summarize related articles, manage their citations, turn photos of whiteboard scribbles into equations or diagrams, or talk through hypotheses or mathematical proofs.

It’s clear that Prism could be a huge time saver. It’s also clear that a lot of people may be disappointed, especially after weeks of high-profile social media chatter from researchers at the firm about how good GPT-5 is at solving math problems. Science is drowning in AI slop: Won&#39;t this just make it worse? Where is OpenAI’s fully automated AI scientist? And when will GPT-5 make a stunning new discovery?

That’s not the mission, says Weil. He would love to see GPT-5 make a discovery. But he doesn’t think that’s what will have the biggest impact on science, at least not in the near term.

“I think more powerfully—and with 100% probability—there’s going to be 10,000 advances in science that maybe wouldn’t have happened or wouldn&#39;t have happened as quickly, and AI will have been a contributor to that,” Weil told MIT Technology Review in an exclusive interview this week. “It won’t be this shining beacon—it will just be an incremental, compounding acceleration.”

Four ways to think about this year&#39;s reckoning.

By studying large language models as if they were living things instead of computer programs, scientists are discovering some of their secrets for the first time.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Today, an estimated 2.2 billion people still have either limited or no access to the internet, largely because they live in remote places. But that number could drop this year, thanks to tests of stratospheric airships, uncrewed aircraft, and other high-altitude platforms for internet delivery.

Even with nearly 10,000 active Starlink satellites in orbit and the OneWeb constellation of 650 satellites, solid internet coverage is not a given across vast swathes of the planet.

One of the most prominent efforts to plug the connectivity gap was Google X’s Loon project. Launched in 2011, it aimed to deliver access using high-altitude balloons stationed above predetermined spots on Earth. But the project faced literal headwinds—the Loons kept drifting away and new ones had to be released constantly, making the venture economically unfeasible.

Although Google shuttered the high-profile Loon in 2021, work on other kinds of high-altitude platform stations (HAPS) has continued behind the scenes. Now, several companies claim they have solved Loon’s problems with different designs—in particular, steerable airships and fixed-wing UAVs (unmanned aerial vehicles)—and are getting ready to prove the tech’s internet beaming potential starting this year, in tests above Japan and Indonesia.

Regulators, too, seem to be thinking seriously about HAPS. In mid-December, for example, the US Federal Aviation Administration released a 50-page document outlining how large numbers of HAPS could be integrated into American airspace. According to the US Census Bureau’s 2024 American Community Survey (ACS) data, some 8 million US households (4.5% of the population) still live completely offline, and HAPS proponents think the technology might get them connected more cheaply than alternatives.

Despite the optimism of the companies involved, though, some analysts remain cautious.

“The HAPS market has been really slow and challenging to develop,” says Dallas Kasaboski, a space industry analyst at the consultancy Analysis Mason. After all, Kasaboski says, the approach has struggled before: “A few companies were very interested in it, very ambitious about it, and then it just didn’t happen.”

Hovering in the thin air at altitudes above 12 miles, HAPS have a unique vantage point to beam down low-latency, high-speed connectivity directly to smartphone users in places too remote and too sparsely populated to justify the cost of laying fiber-optic cables or building ground-based cellular base stations.

“Mobile network operators have some commitment to provide coverage, but they frequently prefer to pay a fine than cover these remote areas,” says Pierre-Antoine Aubourg, chief technology officer of Aalto HAPS, a spinoff from the European aerospace manufacturer Airbus. “With HAPS, we make this remote connectivity case profitable.”

Aalto HAPS has built a solar-powered UAV with a 25-meter wingspan that has conducted many long-duration test flights in recent years. In April 2025 the craft, called Zephyr, broke a HAPS record by staying afloat for 67 consecutive days. The first months of 2026 will be busy for the company, according to Aubourg; Zephyr will do a test run over southern Japan to trial connectivity delivery to residents of some of the country’s smallest and most poorly connected inhabited islands.

Because of its unique geography, Japan is a perfect test bed for HAPS. Many of the country’s roughly 430 inhabited islands are remote, mountainous, and sparsely populated, making them too costly to connect with terrestrial cell towers. Aalto HAPS is partnering with Japan’s largest mobile network operators, NTT DOCOMO and the telecom satellite operator Space Compass, which want to use Zephyr as part of next-generation telecommunication infrastructure.

“Non-terrestrial networks have the potential to transform Japan’s communications ecosystem, addressing access to connectivity in hard-to-reach areas while supporting our country’s response to emergencies,” Shigehiro Hori, co-CEO of Space Compass, said in a statement.

Zephyr, Aubourg explains, will function like another cell tower in the NTT DOCOMO network, only it will be located well above the planet instead of on its surface. It will beam high-speed 5G connectivity to smartphone users without the need for the specialized terminals that are usually required to receive satellite internet. “For the user on the ground, there is no difference when they switch from the terrestrial network to the HAPS network,” Aubourg says. “It’s exactly the same frequency and the same network.”

New Mexico–based Sceye, which has developed a solar-powered helium-filled airship, is also eyeing Japan for pre-commercial trials of its stratospheric connectivity service this year. The firm, which extensively tested its slick 65-meter-long vehicle in 2025, is working with the Japanese telecommunications giant SoftBank. Just like NTT DOCOMO, Softbank is betting on HAPS to take its networks to another level.

Mikkel Frandsen, Sceye’s founder and CEO, says that his firm succeeded where Loon failed by betting on the advantages offered by the more controllable airship shape, intelligent avionics, and innovative batteries that can power an electric fan to keep the aircraft in place.

“Google’s Loon was groundbreaking, but they used a balloon form factor, and despite advanced algorithms—and the ability to change altitude to find desired wind directions and wind speeds—Loon’s system relied on favorable winds to stay over a target area, resulting in unpredictable station-seeking performance,” Frandsen says. “This required a large amount of balloons in the air to have relative certainty that one would stay over the area of operation, which was financially unviable.”

He adds that Sceye’s airship can “point into the wind” and more effectively maintain its position.

“We have significant surface area, providing enough physical space to lift 250-plus kilograms and host solar panels and batteries,” he says, “allowing Sceye to maintain power through day-night cycles, and therefore staying over an area of operation while maintaining altitude.”

Satellite internet currently comes at a price tag that can be too high for people in developing countries, says Kasaboski. For example, Starlink subscriptions start at $10 per month in Africa, but millions of people in these regions are surviving on a mere $2 a day.

Frandsen and Aubourg both claim that HAPS can connect the world’s unconnected more cheaply. Because satellites in low Earth orbit circle the planet at very high speeds, they quickly disappear from a ground terminal&#39;s view, meaning large quantities of those satellites are needed to provide continuous coverage. HAPS can hover, affording a constant view of a region, and more HAPS can be launched to meet higher demand.

“If you want to deliver connectivity with a low-Earth-orbit constellation into one place, you still need a complete constellation,” says Aubourg. “We can deliver connectivity with one aircraft to one location. And then we can tailor much more the size of the fleet according to the market coverage that we need.”

Starlink gets a lot of attention, but satellite internet has some major drawbacks, says Frandsen. A big one is that its bandwidth gets diluted once the number of users in an area grows.

In a recent interview, Starlink cofounder Elon Musk compared the Starlink beams to a flashlight. Given the distance at which those satellites orbit the planet, the cone is wide, covering a large area. That’s okay when users are few and far between, but it can become a problem with higher densities of users.

For example, Ukrainian defense technologists have said that Starlink bandwidth can drop on the front line to a mere 10 megabits per second, compared with the peak offering of 220 Mbps when drones and ground robots are in heavy use. Users in Indonesia, which like Japan is an island nation, also began reporting problems with Starlink shortly after the service was introduced in the country in 2024. Again, bandwidth declined as the number of subscribers grew.

In fact, Frandsen says, Starlink’s performance is less than optimal once the number of users exceeds one person per square kilometer. And that can happen almost anywhere—even relatively isolated island communities can have hundreds or thousands of residents in a small area. “There is a relationship between the altitude and the population you can serve,” Frandsen says. “You can’t bring space closer to the surface of the planet. So the telco companies want to use the stratosphere so that they can get out to more rural populations than they could otherwise serve.” Starlink did not respond to our queries about these challenges.

Sceye and Aalto HAPS see their stratospheric vehicles as part of integrated telecom networks that include both terrestrial cell towers and satellites. But they’re far from the only game in town.

World Mobile, a telecommunications company headquartered in London, thinks its hydrogen-powered high-altitude UAV can compete directly with satellite mega-constellations. The company acquired the HAPS developer Stratospheric Platforms last year. This year, it plans to flight-test an innovative phased array antenna, which it claims will be able to deliver bandwidth of 200 megabits per second (enough to enable ultra-HD video streaming to 500,000 users at the same time over an area of 15,000 square kilometers—equivalent to the coverage of more than 500 terrestrial cell towers, the company says).

Last year, World Mobile also signed a partnership with the Indonesian telecom operator Protelindo to build a prototype Stratomast aircraft, with tests scheduled to begin in late 2027.

Richard Deakin, CEO of World Mobile’s HAPS division World Mobile Stratospheric, says that just nine Stratomasts could supply Scotland’s 5.5 million residents with high-speed internet connectivity at a cost of £40 million ($54 million) per year. That’s equivalent to about 60 pence (80 cents) per person per month, he says. Starlink subscriptions in the UK, of which Scotland is a part, come at £75 ($100) per month.

Companies working on HAPS also extol the convenience of prompt deployments in areas struck by war or natural disasters like Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico, after which Loon played an important role. And they say that HAPS could make it possible for smaller nations to obtain complete control over their celestial internet-beaming infrastructure rather than relying on mega-constellations controlled by larger nations, a major boon at a time of rising geopolitical tensions and crumbling political alliances.

Analysts, however, remain cautious, projecting a HAPS market totaling a modest $1.9 billion by 2033. The satellite internet industry, on the other hand, is expected to be worth $33.44 billion by 2030, according to some estimates.

The use of HAPS for internet delivery to remote locations has been explored since the 1990s, about as long as the concept of low-Earth-orbit mega-constellations. The seemingly more cost-effective stratospheric technology, however, lost to the space fleets thanks to the falling cost of space launches and ambitious investment by Musk’s SpaceX.

Google wasn’t the only tech giant to explore the HAPS idea. Facebook also had a project, called Aquila, that was discontinued after it too faced technical difficulties. Although the current cohort of HAPS makers claim they have solved the challenges that killed their predecessors, Kasaboski warns that they’re playing a different game: catching up with now-established internet-beaming mega constellations. By the end of this year, it’ll be much clearer whether they stand a good chance of doing so.

            <h2>Bonjour Visio: France turns digital sovereignty into policy</h2>
            <p><strong>The Next Web | 2026-01-28</strong></p>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">In a bold turn of phrase and deed, Paris has quietly told Silicon Valley “au revoir.”  On January 26, 2026, France’s Ministry of Finance announced that by 2027, all public servants will switch from U.S. video apps like Microsoft Teams and Zoom to a homegrown platform called Visio.

No more license renewals for Teams, Zoom, Webex, or Meet, just one unified, French-built solution.

In one stroke, a long-discussed slogan “digital sovereignty” has leapt off the podium and into practice. This is not a press release; it’s a watershed moment: Europe’s second-biggest economy is wagering that, when it comes to critical infrastructure, it’s time to govern itself.

“Digital sovereignty” has become the EU’s new watchword, a declaration of independence from foreign tech hegemons. Over the past few years, it has surged from a niche policy to a headline priority, as EU leaders from Ursula von der Leyen to Emmanuel Macron have warned that Europe must control its own networks and data.

The phrase sounds grand, but what changed now is urgency. Americans’ own laws make the risks concrete: under the U.S. CLOUD Act, for example, U.S. authorities can demand data from any American platform, regardless of where it’s stored.

In practice, “jurisdiction follows ownership,” as one analyst noted: even data sitting on a Frankfurt server can be swept up by U.S. warrants if the service provider is American.

Edward Snowden’s revelations and murky court orders have long haunted Europe with the idea that a virtual meeting might be spied on from overseas. Now, with geopolitics in flux, U.S. political turns and global crises, that theoretical risk seems all too real.

The push has taken many forms. The EU has drafted cloud-certification rules demanding “sovereignty” guarantees and drafted data laws to keep Europeans’ information in Europe.

Member states debate mandating local clouds. Digital sovereignty has moved from virtue-signaling to something harder, actual infrastructure.

France’s pivot is concrete and wide-ranging. Visio, developed by the government’s interministerial digital agency (DINUM), has been tested for about a year with some 40,000 regular users. It’s already being adopted piecemeal: CNRS (France’s national research center) will replace all its 34,000 Zoom seats by March 2026, covering 120,000 associated researchers.

By early 2026, the Defense Ministry, finance tax offices, health insurance, and other big agencies will be on Visio. The government now says every state department will use Visio as the default video tool by 2027, after which external conferencing licenses simply won’t be renewed.

The official rationale is familiar: a patchwork of Teams, Zoom, Webex, and friends “fragilises security” and creates hidden costs, dependencies, and interoperability headaches.

Visio is billed as a solution under full French control: it’s hosted on a certified “SecNumCloud” by Dassault-owned Outscale, built with ANSSI (France’s cyber agency) oversight, and even uses French AI for meeting transcription and captions.

The aim, in the minister’s words, is to “end the use of non-European solutions and guarantee the security and confidentiality of public electronic communications by relying on a powerful…sovereign tool”.

In short: no more data flying through American servers or falling under foreign laws.

There are financial perks, too. Officials point out that ditching pricey Teams and Zoom licenses will save money: roughly €1 million per year for every 100,000 users who shift off commercial tools. That’s not pocket change, even if it’s a rounding error in a €600 billion budget. In any case, for France, this isn’t just about cost – it’s about control.

Taken together, these facts show a very concrete policy timeline. In one meeting on Jan. 26, the state literally put a deadline on dependence: four years to shift the ENTIRE civil service. It’s one thing to talk about sovereignty in Brussels speeches, quite another to swap out the nation’s video chat app.

France isn’t alone in flirting with this idea, but it’s the first to bet big. Other EU countries are eyeballing similar moves. In Denmark, parts of the public sector have already announced plans to phase out Microsoft’s software.

In Germany, the state of Schleswig-Holstein recently ditched Microsoft Office in favor of open-source alternatives. Even non-state bodies are joining the sovereignty club: the International Criminal Court said it will move its systems to a German-developed open-source platform (OpenDesk).

These are baby steps compared to France’s all-hands policy, but they reflect a shared unease about over-reliance on foreign tech.

Europe is also wrestling with headline-grabbing hiccups like last year’s massive cloud outages in the U.S., which left public agencies scrambling. The Visio announcement itself notes that Europe’s “overreliance on U.S. IT infrastructure” has been questioned after those failures.

And there are EU-wide initiatives underway, from the Gaia-X cloud alliance to tougher data localization rules – aimed at seeding local alternatives.

If France makes Visio work, it could serve as a proof of concept for others. Will a homegrown tool really run government communications smoothly? If yes, it might embolden policymakers in Brussels or Rome to push harder on local platforms. If not, it could slow the momentum.

For now, France’s move is a beacon: it shows that digital sovereignty can move beyond talk. Other nations will watch closely.

No one seriously argues that keeping calls on Visio will magically end world unrest. Rather, this is a narrow, technical solution to a policy problem. On the other side, France will indeed have tighter control: all servers, encryption keys, and software updates are now under French (and EU) jurisdiction.

Public-sector IT teams can audit code, set security parameters, and avoid nasty surprises (say, a foreign court order) without jumping through transatlantic hoops.

Data stays where the politicians say it stays.

But what might be lost? For one, user experience and innovation often depend on scale. Big Tech’s video platforms have oceans of R&D behind them, from instant translation to seamless device-hopping, and millions of users giving feedback.

A new platform built from scratch may not match Teams’ polish or Zoom’s ubiquity overnight. (The French have even admitted an irony: naming it “Visio” risks confusion with Microsoft Visio, the longtime diagram app, hinting that branding and polish sometimes play second fiddle to strategy.)

There’s also the question of interoperability: how well will Visio meetings work when French officials Zoom into a partner country’s conference, or vice versa? Will France demand that foreign delegations install its app, or allow links to other networks? The devil is in the details.

Some critics fret that an insular approach could fragment standards. One EU paper urges that sovereignty shouldn’t mean isolation but rather a robust, open ecosystem.

If every country builds its own siloed cloud and chat service, the Internet risks reinventing wheels (and reinventing firewalls) in every member state. Of course, Visio is only for civil servants, not a consumer product, yet it sets a precedent.

On the other hand, an expertly executed French stack could jumpstart a continental open-source community or spur startups to plug gaps. It’s a calculated gamble: France assumes that on net, its security and strategic stakes outweigh any shortfall in bells and whistles.

For its part, France says this isn’t a bare-bones trade-off. Officials emphasize Visio will include modern features: speaker separation, AI for transcripts, captions, etc. The goal is “not [a] minimalist replacement,” but a full-featured tool under domestic control.

In other words, they aim for the best of both worlds, though acknowledging it’s a tall order.

In its own softly decisive way, France’s Visio plan signals a definitive shift: digital sovereignty is no longer a future wish or empty catchphrase, but a deadline-driven program.

Europe has debated “strategic autonomy” for years; this is the first major state-level bet, with clear timelines and budget line savings. From the perspective of a tech editor watching policy trends, it’s heartening to see ambition meet action.

Will it pay off? If Visio runs smoothly, France will score a coup: more secure chats, money saved, and perhaps the bragging rights of a proof of concept. If glitches persist, France’s analysts may ask if the Q1 rollout to 200,000 civil servants is biting off too much too soon.

Either way, the move puts stakes on the table. Digital sovereignty has many meanings, but here it means doing something concrete, even if it means saying “non” to familiar tools.

In the end, it’s a balancing act. Europe gains control of what it might risk in convenience. France has just turned insurance talk into policy practice. Other countries will now watch and learn: Visio is not just a video app; it’s France’s case study in what digital independence can actually look like.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Slush, the Finnish nonprofit behind one of the most influential startup gatherings in Europe, has named Noora Saksa as its new Chief Executive Officer, a shift that indicates a strategic evolution for the organisation as it expands beyond its flagship event model.

Saksa assumes the top role after years as Slush’s Chief Operating & Financial Officer and Head of Partnerships, where she managed core operations, finances, and ecosystem programmes.

Her trajectory within the organisation reflects a deep operational understanding of Slush’s mission: to connect founders, investors, and builders in ways that help founders advance on their journeys.

In stepping into the CEO role, Saksa inherits an agenda that extends far beyond an annual conference in Helsinki.

Under her leadership, Slush aims to grow year-round engagement through digital experiences and local ecosystem programmes, and to deepen its reach in founder support globally.

Board members see her operational experience and ecosystem insight as assets for Slush’s next chapter.

Slush remains organised largely by a core team of young professionals and volunteers, a structure that has supported its rapid growth since the early 2010s.

The event brings together thousands of founders and investors each year, and the organisation’s year-round platform aims to sustain connections long after the main event ends.

In her opening statement as CEO, Saksa said the focus will remain on building meaningful experiences that help founders tackle practical challenges, expand networks, and find capital. Her intimate knowledge of Slush’s operations positions her to balance growth ambitions with the organisation’s mission-driven ethos.

Noora Saksa has played a central role at Slush as Chief Operating & Financial Officer and Head of Partnerships, overseeing operations, finances, and startup-focused programmes. Before her tenure at Slush, she held leadership roles in entrepreneurial student societies and worked in startup support functions. Saksa studied Industrial Engineering and Management at Aalto University with an exchange at Eindhoven University of Technology. Her experience spans operational strategy, ecosystem building, and partnership development within Nordic innovation communities.

            <p><strong>The Next Web | 2026-01-26</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://thenextweb.com/news/rainbow-weather-raises-5-5m-to-refine-real-time-weather-forecasting">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Warsaw, Poland 26 January 2026 – Rainbow Weather has raised $5.5 million in seed funding to push weather forecasting further into the short-term, high-precision territory it believes the industry still underserves.

The Warsaw-based climate tech startup focuses on hyperlocal, minute-by-minute forecasts, zeroing in on what happens in the next few hours rather than days out.

The round was backed by a syndicate of investors, including Yuri Gurski, founder of Flo Health, one of Europe’s best-known consumer tech unicorns.

Rainbow Weather’s core product is a mobile app that delivers four-hour precipitation forecasts calculated from the exact moment a user checks the weather.

Open the app at 3:51 am, and it forecasts conditions through 7:51am, refreshed every 10 minutes and mapped down to a one-square-kilometre grid. That level of temporal and spatial precision is what the company says sets it apart from mainstream weather apps.

Most major providers, including AccuWeather, Apple Weather, and The Weather Company, still rely on approaches that either simplify cloud movement or depend on large-scale numerical models designed for longer forecasts. According to Rainbow Weather, both methods struggle when conditions change quickly.

“Many legacy forecasting providers rely on optical flow for short-term precipitation forecasting. That’s a fast but simplistic method that treats clouds as shapes in motion, without any understanding of atmospheric physics,” explained Alexander Matveenko, co-founder of Rainbow Weather. “A second category of services uses large-scale mathematical models that do incorporate physical principles, but they’re so cumbersome and slow that they can’t respond quickly to real-time weather changes.”

Rainbow Weather positions itself in between, using machine learning to fuse high-resolution data from radar, satellites, weather stations, and even smartphone barometers. By combining these sources, the company claims it can reduce the noise and bias inherent in individual datasets, then generate forecasts faster than traditional systems.

The app currently focuses on short-term precipitation, but it has expanded into tracking wildfires and hurricanes, a feature added after the Palisades fire in Los Angeles. That expansion reflects a broader ambition to become a real-time risk awareness tool, not just a rain predictor.

The new funding will be used to extend Rainbow Weather’s forecasting window from four hours to 24 hours, add more weather parameters beyond precipitation, and grow its B2B offering.

The commercial weather intelligence market is expected to grow steadily over the next decade, driven by industries that depend on precise, near-term forecasts, from logistics and agriculture to aviation and drone operations.

Rainbow Weather says it has surpassed one million installs and has launched APIs aimed at companies that “can’t afford to get weather wrong.” It has also partnered with an unnamed long-term forecasting firm, supplying near-term data to improve broader climate models.

The founding team brings a track record of exits in applied AI. CEO Yuriy Melnichek previously founded AIMatter, acquired by Google, as well as consumer apps later bought by Pinterest and Farfetch. Matveenko previously sold mapping startup MapData to Mapbox.

Alongside its commercial products, the team also runs weatherindex.ai, an open-source project that evaluates short-term precipitation forecasts from major providers in real time. The tool compares live forecasts against verified airport weather reports, using standard accuracy metrics. It’s an unusual move in an industry not known for transparent benchmarking.

For Rainbow Weather, that openness is part of the pitch. The company is betting that as climate volatility increases, users and businesses will care less about next week’s weather and more about what happens in the next hour, and whether the forecast can be trusted.

Rainbow Weather is a next-gen climate tech startup for ultra-accurate short-term forecasts founded in 2021 by Yuriy Melnichek, who previously built AIMatter (acquired by Google), a neural network-based AI platform, as well as the video creation and editing app Vochi (acquired by Pinterest), and fashion marketplace Wanna (acquired by Farfetch), and Alexander Matveenko, a founder of artificial intelligence mapping startup MapData that he sold to Mapbox in 2017.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">London-based AI video startup Synthesia has raised $200 million in a Series E round, nearly doubling its valuation to around $4 billion and cementing its position as one of Europe’s most valuable AI companies.

The round was led by Google Ventures, with participation from existing investors, underscoring continued appetite for applied AI products that have already found a clear commercial use.

Synthesia builds generative AI tools that let companies create videos using AI-generated avatars instead of cameras, studios, or presenters. The technology has found a strong foothold in corporate training, internal communications, and product explainers, areas where speed, scale, and consistency often matter more than production gloss.

“Synthesia was founded on two core beliefs: first, that AI will bring the cost of content creation down to zero. And secondly, that AI video provides a better, more engaging way for organizations to communicate and learn,” said Victor Riparbelli, Synthesia’s co-founder and CEO.

Synthesia says a significant share of Fortune 100 companies now use its platform, a rare level of enterprise penetration for a European AI startup at this stage. Rather than chasing consumer virality, the company has built its business around predictable, high-value enterprise use cases, a strategy investors have increasingly rewarded over the past year.

The funding comes at a moment when enthusiasm around generative AI has shifted from experimentation to execution. Enterprises are no longer asking whether AI video works, but how reliably it can plug into existing workflows.

Synthesia’s pitch is that AI-generated video should be as routine as slides or documents, created quickly, updated easily, and deployed globally without production bottlenecks.

At a $4 billion valuation, Synthesia joins a small group of European AI companies that have managed to scale beyond regional relevance.

Its rise also highlights a broader pattern: applied AI startups, focused on specific business functions rather than general-purpose models, are attracting some of the largest growth rounds in the market.

For the UK tech ecosystem, the deal is another signal that London remains a serious hub for commercial AI, even as regulatory debates continue around model safety, copyright, and synthetic media.

Synthesia has previously positioned itself as cautious about misuse, building safeguards around consent and disclosure for its avatars, a stance that may become more important as scrutiny of AI-generated content increases.

The challenge ahead is less about proving demand and more about maintaining trust and differentiation as competitors multiply.

But with deep enterprise adoption, a clear product focus, and backing from one of Silicon Valley’s most influential investors, Synthesia is entering its next phase with momentum firmly on its side.
