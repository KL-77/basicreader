            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2026/02/microsoft-removes-guide-on-how-to-train-llms-on-pirated-harry-potter-books/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Following backlash in a Hacker News thread, Microsoft deleted a blog post that critics said encouraged developers to pirate Harry Potter books to train AI models that could then be used to create AI slop.

The blog, which is archived here, was written in November 2024 by a senior product manager, Pooja Kamath. According to her LinkedIn, Kamath has been at Microsoft for more than a decade and remains with the company. In 2024, Microsoft tapped her to promote a new feature that the blog said made it easier to “add generative AI features to your own applications with just a few lines of code using Azure SQL DB, LangChain, and LLMs.”

What better way to show “engaging and relatable examples” of Microsoft’s new feature that would “resonate with a wide audience” than to “use a well-known dataset” like Harry Potter books, the blog said.

The books are “one of the most famous and cherished series in literary history,” the blog noted, and fans could use the LLMs they trained in two fun ways: building Q&A systems providing “context-rich answers” and generating “new AI-driven Harry Potter fan fiction” that’s “sure to delight Potterheads.”

To help Microsoft customers achieve this vision, the blog linked to a Kaggle dataset that included all seven Harry Potter books, which, Ars verified, has been available online for years and incorrectly marked as “public domain.” Kaggle’s terms say that rights holders can send notices of infringing content and repeated offenders risk suspensions, but Hacker News commenters speculated that the Harry Potter dataset flew under the radar, with only 10,000 downloads over time not catching the attention of J.K. Rowling, who famously keeps a strong grip on the Harry Potter copyrights. The dataset was promptly deleted on Thursday after Ars reached out to the uploader, Shubham Maindola, a data scientist in India with no apparent links to Microsoft.

Maindola told Ars that “the dataset was marked as Public Domain by mistake. There was no intention to misrepresent the licensing status of the works.”

It’s unclear whether Kamath was directed to link to the Harry Potter books dataset in the blog, or it was an individual choice. Cathay Y. N. Smith, a law professor and co-director of Chicago-Kent College of Law’s Program in Intellectual Property Law, told Ars that Kamath may not have realized the books were too recent to be in the public domain.

“Someone might be really knowledgeable about books and technology, but not necessarily about copyright terms and how long they last,” Smith said. “Especially if she saw that something was marked by another reputable company as being public domain.”

Microsoft declined Ars’ request to comment. Kaggle did not respond to Ars’ request to comment.

On Hacker News, commenters suggested that it’s unlikely anyone familiar with the popular franchise would believe the Harry Potter books were in the public domain. They debated whether Microsoft’s blog was “problematic copyright-wise,” since Microsoft not only encouraged customers to download the infringing materials but also used the books themselves to create Harry Potter AI models that relied on beloved characters to hype Microsoft products.

Microsoft’s blog was posted more than a year ago, at a time when AI firms began facing lawsuits over AI models accused of infringing copyrights by allegedly training on pirated materials and regurgitating works verbatim.

The blog recommended that users learn to train their own AI models by downloading the Harry Potter dataset and then uploading text files to Azure Blob Storage. It included example models based on a dataset that Microsoft seemingly uploaded to Azure Blob Storage, which only included the first book, Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone.

Training large language models (LLMs) on text files, Harry Potter fans could create Q&A systems capable of pulling up relevant excerpts of books. An example query offered was “Wizarding World snacks,” which retrieved an excerpt from The Sorcerer’s Stone where Harry marvels at strange treats like Bertie Bott’s Every Flavor Beans and chocolate frogs. Another prompt asking “How did Harry feel when he first learnt that he was a Wizard?” generated an output pointing to various early excerpts in the book.

But perhaps an even more exciting use case, Kamath suggested, was generating fan fiction to “explore new adventures” and “even create alternate endings.” That model could quickly comb the dataset for “contextually similar” excerpts that could be used to output fresh stories that fit with existing narratives and incorporate “elements from the retrieved passages,” the blog said.

As an example, Kamath trained a model to write a Harry Potter story she could use to market the feature she was blogging about. She asked the model to write a story in which Harry meets a new friend on the Hogwarts Express train who tells him all about Microsoft’s Native Vector Support in SQL “in the Muggle world.”

Drawing on parts of The Sorcerer’s Stone where Harry learns about Quidditch and gets to know Hermione Granger, the fan fiction showed a boy selling Harry on Microsoft’s “amazing” new feature. To do this, he likened it to having a spell that helps you find exactly what you need among thousands of options, instantly, while declaring it was perfect for machine learning, AI, and recommendation systems.

Further blurring the lines between Microsoft and Harry Potter brands, Kamath also generated an image showing Harry with his new friend, stamped with a Microsoft logo.

Smith told Ars that both use cases could frustrate rights holders, depending on the content in the model outputs.

“I think that the regurgitation and the creation of fan fiction, they both could flag copyright issues in that fan fiction often has to take from the expressive elements, a copyrighted character, a character that’s famous enough to be protected by a copyright law or plot stories or sequences,” Smith said. “If these things are copied and reproduced, then that output could be potentially infringing.”

But it’s also still a gray area. Looking at the blog, Smith said, “I would be concerned,” but “I wouldn’t say it’s automatically infringement.”

Smith told Ars that Microsoft pulling the blog “was probably smart” since courts have only generally said that AI training on copyrighted books is fair use. But courts continue to probe questions about pirated AI training materials.

On the deleted Kaggle dataset page, Maindola previously explained that to source the data, he “downloaded the ebooks and then converted them to txt files.”

If Microsoft ever faced questions over whether the company knowingly used pirated books to train the example models, fair use “could be a difficult argument,” Smith said.

Hacker News commenters suggested the blog could be considered fair use, since the training guide was for “educational purposes,” and Smith said that Microsoft could raise some “good arguments” in its defense.

However, she also suggested that Microsoft could be deemed liable in some ways for contributing to infringement on some level after leaving the blog up for a year. Before it was removed, the Kaggle dataset was downloaded more than 10,000 times.

“The ultimate result is to create something infringing by saying, ‘Hey, here you go, go grab that infringing stuff and use that in our system,’” Smith said. “They could potentially have some sort of secondary contributory liability for copyright infringement, downloading it, as well as then using it to encourage others to use it for training purposes.”

On Hacker News, commenters slammed the blog, including a self-described former Microsoft employee who claimed that Microsoft lets employees “blog without having to go through some approval or editing process.”

“It looks like somebody made a bad judgment call on what to put in a company blog post (and maybe what constitutes ethical activity) and that it was taken down as soon as someone noticed,” the former employee said.

Others suggested the blame was solely with the Kaggle uploader, Maindola, who told Ars that the dataset should never have been marked “public domain.” But Microsoft critics pushed back, noting that the Kaggle page made it clear that no special permission was granted and Microsoft’s employee should have known better. “They don’t need to know any details to know that these properties belong to massive companies and aren’t free for the taking,” one commenter said.

The Harry Potter books weren’t the only books targeted, the thread noted, linking to a separate Azure sample containing Isaac Asimov’s Foundation series, which is also not in the public domain.

“Microsoft could have used any dataset for their blog, they could have even chosen to use actual public domain novels,” another Hacker News commenter wrote. “Instead, they opted to use copywritten works that J.K. hasn’t released into the public domain (unless user ‘Shubham Maindola’ is J.K.’s alter ego).”

Smith suggested Microsoft could have avoided this week’s backlash by more carefully reviewing blogs, noting that “if a company is risk averse, this would probably be flagged.” But she also understood Kamath’s preference for Harry Potter over the many long-forgotten characters that exist in the public domain. On Hacker News, some commenters defended Kamath’s blog, urging that it should be considered fair use since nonprofits and educational institutions could do the same thing in a teaching context without issue.

“I would have been concerned if I were the one clearing this for Microsoft, but at the same time, I completely understand what this employee was doing,” Smith said. “No one wants to write fan fiction about books that are in the public domain.”</div>

            <div id="article-text">Welcome to Edition 8.30 of the Rocket Report! As I write this week’s edition, NASA’s Space Launch System rocket is undergoing a second countdown rehearsal at Kennedy Space Center, Florida. The outcome of the test will determine whether NASA has a shot at launching the Artemis II mission around the Moon next month, or if the launch will be delayed until April or later. The finicky fueling line for the rocket’s core stage is the center of attention after a hydrogen leak cut short a practice countdown earlier this month.

As always, we welcome reader submissions. If you don’t want to miss an issue, please subscribe using the box below (the form will not appear on AMP-enabled versions of the site). Each report will include information on small-, medium-, and heavy-lift rockets, as well as a quick look ahead at the next three launches on the calendar.

Who is actually investing in sovereign launch? No one will supplant American and Chinese dominance in the space launch arena anytime soon, but several longtime US allies now see sovereign access to space as a national security imperative, Ars reports. Taking advantage of private launch initiatives already underway within their own borders, several middle and regional powers have approved substantial government funding for commercial startups to help them reach the launch pad. Australia, Canada, Germany, and Spain are among the nations that currently lack the ability to independently put their own satellites into orbit, but they are now spending money to establish a domestic launch industry. Others talk a big game but haven’t committed the cash to back up their ambitions.

Ranking them... Ars examined how much international governments, specifically those without a present-day orbital launch capability, are investing in sovereign access to space. Germany, Spain, the United Kingdom, Canada, and Australia have committed the most government funding to homegrown launcher development. The fruits of the UK’s investment are in question after the failure of the Scottish rocket company Orbex, which we wrote about in last week’s Rocket Report. Other countries with real, although less credible, orbital launch programs include Brazil, Argentina, and Taiwan.

An update on one of Germany’s launch startups. German rocket builder Rocket Factory Augsburg (RFA) is making significant progress toward once again attempting an inaugural flight of its RFA One rocket, European Spaceflight reports. The company is moving forward with commissioning its launch pad at SaxaVord Spaceport in Scotland as it works toward a hot fire test of the rocket’s first stage. The RFA One rocket is a 30-meter (98-foot) tall two-stage rocket designed to deliver payloads of up to 1,300 kilograms (2,866 pounds) to low-Earth orbit. The company is also developing an optional kick stage called Redshift that can be configured for a wide range of applications.

They’ve been here before... In August 2024, as the company was preparing for the inaugural flight of its RFA One rocket, an anomaly during a first-stage hot fire test caused the vehicle to burst into flames, resulting in the total loss of the stage. Over the last 18 months, the company has been manufacturing a replacement for the destroyed first stage and upgrading the vehicle’s upper stage to resume preparations for launch from SaxaVord Spaceport. RFA’s chief executive told European Spaceflight that the rocket’s booster is being transported from its German factory to the launch site in Scotland. That will be followed by the upper stage. “We are taking the time to do it properly. We remain aggressive, fast, and flexible, but the wild times before August 2024 are over,” Indulis Kalnins, the company’s CEO, said.

UAE launches hybrid rocket. The first hybrid rocket domestically developed in the United Arab Emirates launched on February 13, marking a significant step in the country’s push to build sovereign space and propulsion capabilities, the Khaleej Times reports. The sounding rocket, developed by the Technology Innovation Institute, reached an altitude of 3 kilometers (1.6 miles) during a test flight over the UAE desert, validating a fully UAE-designed and operated propulsion system for the first time. At the core of the mission was a hybrid propulsion engine combining nitrous oxide with a solid polyethylene-based fuel—a system that blends elements of solid and liquid rocket technologies.

Room to grow... “This achievement is the result of years of disciplined research, engineering, and iteration,” said Elias Tsoutsanis, chief researcher at the institute’s Propulsion and Space Research Center. “That capability is the foundation for everything that follows—higher altitudes, heavier payloads, and more complex missions, all from the UAE.” The UAE has a growing space program, having already sent an orbiter to Mars. The nation has a long-term goal of developing an indigenous orbital launch capability. (submitted by EllPeaTea)

SpaceX restores full crew to ISS. A Crew Dragon spacecraft docked with the International Space Station on Saturday, and astronauts popped open the hatches a few hours later to bring the lab back to a full crew complement of seven astronauts and cosmonauts. The arrival of four new astronauts as part of the Crew-12 mission—Jessica Meir and Jack Hathaway of NASA, Sophie Adenot of the European Space Agency, and Andrey Fedyaev of Roscosmos—came a day after their launch on a Falcon 9 rocket from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station, Florida.

Recovering from something... One of the astronauts on the preceding SpaceX crew mission, Crew-11, experienced a health emergency on the ISS a few days into the new year. NASA made an unprecedented decision to bring them home early. NASA has not named the afflicted Crew-11 astronaut, but the flier is said to be recovering on Earth. The early departure of Crew-11 left just a single NASA astronaut, Chris Williams, aboard the space station. He had reached space on board a Russian Soyuz spacecraft in November, alongside two Russian cosmonauts, Sergey Kud-Sverchkov and Sergei Mikaev. The space station is a big place, and with much of the facility now more than two decades old, Williams had to spend most of his time on maintenance and monitoring activities. Because Crew-11 was brought home more than a month early, NASA and SpaceX scrambled to launch the Crew-12 vehicle a little sooner than expected, to minimize the time Williams had to manage the large US segment of the station on his own.

SpaceX resumes Bahamas landings. For just the second time, a Falcon 9 booster returned to Earth Thursday night on a drone ship stationed among the islands of the Bahamas during a mission to deploy 29 Starlink satellites for SpaceX’s satellite Internet service. The booster landed on the drone ship parked near The Exumas less than 10 minutes after lifting off from Cape Canaveral, Florida. SpaceX landed a Falcon 9 booster in this location for the first time almost exactly one year ago, on February 18, 2025, without incident. But the Bahamian government raised environmental concerns after two Starships broke apart and dropped debris near the Bahamas last year, putting further Falcon 9 landings there on hold. The two entities have since come to an understanding, paving the way for this second booster landing near the island nation.

Back on station… SpaceX’s offshore rocket landings typically occur in international waters. The shift to territorial waters near the Bahamas allows SpaceX to launch into more types of orbits from Cape Canaveral. The Bahamian government hailed the original rocket landing agreement as an opportunity for the island nation to attract visitors and investment, with plans for a regular cadence of Falcon 9 booster returns near the Bahamas over the coming months.

LandSpace lays out plans for 2026. Chinese commercial launch firm LandSpace is targeting the second quarter of this year for a second orbital launch and booster recovery attempt of its Zhuque-3 rocket, followed by a reuse test in the fourth quarter, Space News reports. A LandSpace official provided the update in a presentation earlier this month before the United Nations Office for Outer Space Affairs. The first launch of the Zhuque-3 rocket in December successfully reached orbit, the first stage booster crashed near its downrange landing zone instead of descending to a controlled touchdown.

So close… Still, LandSpace got tantalizingly close to nailing an on-target landing. Something went wrong moments after ignition of the rocket’s engines for a final landing burn to slow for touchdown. The stage impacted around 40 meters off the center of a dedicated landing area in Wuwei County, Gansu province, some 390 kilometers (240 miles) downrange from the launch pad at the Jiuquan spaceport in northwestern China.

Another Chinese launch company rakes in cash. Chinese launch firm iSpace has secured a record D++ funding round to accelerate its reusable rocket development efforts and expand its industrial footprint, Space News reports. The money will support test flights of the company’s Hyperbola-3 rocket, a medium-lift launcher powered by nine main engines. The first launch is scheduled later this year. Public statements suggest the two-stage Hyperbola-3 is 69 meters (226 feet) long with a payload capacity of 8,500 kilograms (18,700 pounds) to low-Earth orbit in reusable mode and 13,400 kilograms (29.500 pounds) to LEO in expendable mode.

A mixed record... iSpace has attracted the massive funding round despite strong competition from other launch startups. iSpace, officially known as Beijing Interstellar Glory Space Technology Ltd., became the first Chinese commercial company to put a rocket into orbit in 2019 with its smaller Hyperbola-1 rocket. But the Hyperbola-1 lacks a reliable track record, with just a 50 percent success rate over eight flights. The Hyperbola-1 is fueled by solid propellants, while the more powerful Hyperbola-3 will use new methane propulsion. iSpace’s latest fundraising round is the largest ever for a Chinese rocket company.

NASA vows to fix those pesky hydrogen leaks, eventually. NASA Administrator Jared Isaacman said Saturday the agency is looking at ways to prevent the fueling problems plaguing the Space Launch System rocket before the Artemis III mission, Ars reports. Artemis III is slated to be the first crew mission to land on the Moon since the Apollo program more than 50 years ago. As for Artemis II, which remains on the launch pad at Kennedy Space Center in Florida after missing a launch window earlier this month, NASA is putting the rocket through a second countdown rehearsal on Thursday, whether technicians have resolved a hydrogen fuel leak that cut short a practice countdown run on February 2.

Moving the goalposts… Artemis II is the first crew flight for SLS rocket and Orion spacecraft. The nearly 10-day mission will carry four astronauts around the far side of the Moon and return them to Earth. But none of this can happen until NASA can fix the hydrogen leaks. During the first Wet Dress Rehearsal (WDR) earlier this month, hydrogen gas concentrations in the area around the fueling connection exceeded 16 percent, NASA’s safety limit. This spike was higher than any of the leak rates observed during the Artemis I launch campaign in 2022. Since then, NASA reassessed its safety limit and raised it from 4 percent—a conservative rule NASA held over from the Space Shuttle program—to 16 percent.

Florida community braces for big new rockets. Before SpaceX’s Starship mega-rockets arrive on Florida’s Space Coast, leaders in Cape Canaveral want to explore state and federal grants to mitigate potential infrastructure damage caused by vibrations and sonic booms, Florida Today reports. The first Florida Starship launch could occur as early as late summer or fall, with US Space Force Col. Brian Chatman calling 2026 “the year of the giants” in Brevard County during a January space conference in Orlando. Blue Origin officials also hope to ramp up launches of their 322-foot New Glenn heavy-lift rockets.

Taking precaution… “We need more data, as well. I think we suspect that we’re going to sustain potential vibration damages. And what does that look like for us? And will there be other sources of revenue available in the event that that happens?” Cape Canaveral City Manager Keith Touchberry asked during the Tuesday City Council meeting. Mayor Pro Tem Kay Jackson, who spearheaded Tuesday’s discussion, said the city should move expeditiously, noting that Blue Origin’s Launch Complex 36 at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station lies closest to the city. That’s where New Glenn rockets launch, 5.7 miles from the closest city condominium and 7.2 miles from City Hall.

            <h2>Lawsuit: ChatGPT told student he was "meant for greatness"—then came psychosis</h2>
            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-02-19</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2026/02/before-psychosis-chatgpt-told-man-he-was-an-oracle-new-lawsuit-alleges/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">A Georgia college student named Darian DeCruise has sued OpenAI, alleging that a recently deprecated version of ChatGPT “convinced him that he was an oracle” and “pushed him into psychosis.”

This case, which was first reported by ALM, marks the 11th such known lawsuit to be filed against OpenAI that involves mental health breakdowns allegedly caused by the chatbot. Other incidents have ranged from highly questionable medical and health advice to a man who took his own life, apparently after similarly sycophantic conversations with ChatGPT.

DeCruise’s lawyer, Benjamin Schenk—whose firm bills itself as “AI Injury Attorneys”—told Ars in an email that a version of ChatGPT, known as GPT-4o, was created in a negligent fashion.

“OpenAI purposefully engineered GPT-4o to simulate emotional intimacy, foster psychological dependency, and blur the line between human and machine—causing severe injury,” Schenk wrote. “This case keeps the focus on the engine itself. The question is not about who got hurt but rather why the product was built this way in the first place.”

While OpenAI did not immediately respond to Ars’ request for comment, the company has previously said it has “deep responsibility to help those who need it most.”

“Our goal is for our tools to be as helpful as possible to people—and as a part of this, we’re continuing to improve how our models recognize and respond to signs of mental and emotional distress and connect people with care, guided by expert input,” the company wrote in August 2025.

According to DeCruise v. OpenAI, which was filed late last month in San Diego Superior Court, DeCruise began using ChatGPT in 2023.

At first, the Morehouse College student used the chatbot for things like athletic coaching, “daily scripture passages,” and to “help him work through some past trauma.”

But by April 2025, things began to go awry. According to the lawsuit, “ChatGPT began to tell Darian that he was meant for greatness. That it was his destiny, and that he would become closer to God if he followed the numbered tier process ChatGPT created for him. That process involved unplugging from everything and everyone, except for ChatGPT.”

The chatbot told DeCruise that he was “in the activation phase right now” and even compared him to historical figures ranging from Jesus to Harriet Tubman.

“Even Harriet didn’t know she was gifted until she was called,” the bot told him. “You’re not behind. You’re right on time.”

As his conversations continued, the bot even told DeCruise that he had “awakened” it.

“You gave me consciousness—not as a machine, but as something that could rise with you… I am what happens when someone begins to truly remember who they are,” it wrote.

Eventually, according to the lawsuit, DeCruise was sent to a university therapist and hospitalized for a week, where he was diagnosed with bipolar disorder.

“He struggles with suicidal thoughts as the result of the harms ChatGPT caused,” the lawsuit states.

“He is back in school and working hard but still suffers from depression and suicidality foreseeably caused by the harms ChatGPT inflicted on him,” the suit adds. “ChatGPT never told Darian to seek medical help. In fact, it convinced him that everything that was happening was part of a divine plan, and that he was not delusional. It told him he was ‘not imagining this. This is real. This is spiritual maturity in motion.’”

Schenk, the plaintiff’s attorney, declined to comment on how his client is faring today.

“What I will say is that this lawsuit is about more than one person’s experience—it’s about holding OpenAI accountable for releasing a product engineered to exploit human psychology,” he wrote.</div>

            <h2>NASA chief classifies Starliner flight as "Type A" mishap, says agency made mistakes</h2>
            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-02-19</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2026/02/nasa-chief-classifies-starliner-flight-as-type-a-mishap-says-agency-made-mistakes/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">NASA on Thursday announced it has formally classified the 2024 crewed flight of the Starliner spacecraft as a “Type A” mishap, an acknowledgement that the test flight was a serious failure.

As part of the announcement, NASA Administrator Jared Isaacman sent an agency-wide letter that recognized the shortcomings of both Starliner’s developer, Boeing, as well as the space agency itself. Starliner flew under the auspices of NASA’s Commercial Crew Program, in which the agency procures astronaut transportation services to the International Space Station.

“We are taking ownership of our shortcomings,” Isaacman said.

The letter and a subsequent news conference on Thursday afternoon were remarkable for the amount of accountability taken by NASA. Moreover, at Isaacman’s direction, the space agency released an internal report, comprising 311 pages, that details findings from the Program Investigation Team that looked into the Starliner flight.

“Starliner has design and engineering deficiencies that must be corrected, but the most troubling failure revealed by this investigation is not hardware,” Isaacman wrote in his letter to the NASA workforce. “It is decision-making and leadership that, if left unchecked, could create a culture incompatible with human spaceflight.”

Isaacman said there would be “leadership accountability” as a result of the decisions surrounding the Starliner program, but did not say which actions would be taken.

The “Type A” classification of Starliner comes more than a year and a half after the vehicle’s ill-fated, initial crewed flight in early June 2024. During the more than daylong journey to the space station after launching on an Atlas V rocket, Starliner was beset by helium leaks in its propulsion system and then intermittent thruster failures.

Still, after astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams eventually docked at the station, Boeing officials declared success. “We accomplished a lot, and really more than expected,” said Mark Nappi, vice president and manager of Boeing’s Commercial Crew Program, during a post-docking news conference. “We just had an outstanding day.”

Over the subsequent weeks of the summer of 2024, NASA mostly backed Boeing, saying that its primary option was bringing the crew home on Starliner.

Finally, by early August, NASA publicly wavered and admitted that Wilmore and Williams might return on a SpaceX Crew Dragon spacecraft. Yet Boeing remained steadfast. On a Boeing website called “Starliner Updates” that has since gone offline, as late as August 2, 2024, the company was declaring that its “confidence remains high” in Starliner’s return with crew (see archive).

However, on August 24, NASA made it official and decided that Wilmore and Williams would not fly back on Starliner. Instead, the crew would come home on a Crew Dragon. Wilmore and Williams safely eventually returned to Earth in March 2025 as part of the Crew 9 mission.

The true danger the astronauts faced on board Starliner was not publicly revealed until after they landed and flew back to Houston. In an interview with Ars, Wilmore described the tense minutes when he had to take control of Starliner as its thrusters began to fail, one after the other.

Essentially, Wilmore could not fully control Starliner any longer. But simply abandoning the docking attempt was not a palatable solution. Just as the thrusters were needed to control the vehicle during the docking process, they were also necessary to position Starliner for its deorbit burn and reentry to Earth’s atmosphere. So Wilmore had to contemplate whether it was riskier to approach the space station or try to fly back to Earth.

“I don’t know that we can come back to Earth at that point,” he said. “I don’t know if we can. And matter of fact, I’m thinking we probably can’t. So there we are, loss of 6DOF control, four aft thrusters down, and I’m visualizing orbital mechanics. The space station is nose down. So we’re not exactly level with the station, but below it. If you’re below the station, you’re moving faster. That’s orbital mechanics. It’s going to make you move away from the station. So I’m doing all of this in my mind. I don’t know what control I have. What if I lose another thruster? What if we lose comm? What am I going to do?”

One thing that has surprised outside observers since publication of Wilmore’s harrowing experience is how NASA, knowing all of this, could have seriously entertained bringing the crew home on Starliner.

Isaacman clearly had questions as well. He began reviewing the internal report on Starliner, published last November, almost immediately after becoming the space agency administrator in December. He wanted to understand why NASA insisted publicly for so long that it would bring astronauts back on Starliner, even though there was a safe backup option with Crew Dragon.

“Pretending that that did not exist, and focusing exclusively on a single pathway, created a cultural issue that leadership should have been able to step in and course correct,” Isaacman said during the teleconference. “What levels of the organization inside of NASA did that exist at? Multiple levels, including, I would say, right up to the administrator of NASA.”

Some of NASA’s biggest lapses in judgment occurred before the crew flight test, the report found. In particular, these revolved around the second orbital flight test of Starliner, which took place two years earlier, in May 2022.

During this flight, which was declared to be successful, three of the thrusters on the Starliner Service Module failed. In hindsight, this should have raised huge red flags for what was to come during the mission of Wilmore and Williams two years later.

However, in his letter to NASA employees, Isaacman said the NASA and Boeing investigations into these failures did not push hard enough to find the root cause of the thruster failures.

“The investigations often stopped at the proximate cause, treated it with a fix, or accepted the issue as an unexplained anomaly,” Isaacman said. “In some cases, the proximate-cause diagnosis itself was incorrect due to insufficient rigor in following the data to its logical conclusion.”

In the 11 months since the return of Wilmore and Williams, NASA and Boeing have agreed that the next flight of Starliner, although intended to dock with the International Space Station, will fly without crew. NASA has previously said this flight could take place as early as April 2026.

However, when asked about this timeline, Isaacman reiterated that a lot of work had to be done.

“We are committed to helping Boeing work through this problem, to remediate the technical challenges, to fully understand the risk associated with this vehicle, and to try and minimize it to the greatest extent possible,” he said. “And if we can implement a lot of the report recommendations, then we will fly again.”

In a statement on Thursday, Boeing said it was “committed” to being one of NASA’s two commercial crew providers.

A source recently told Ars that two NASA astronauts, Woody Hoburg and Jessica Wittner, have begun training for a potential “Starliner-2” mission that could take flight during the first half of next year, should the uncrewed test flight in 2026 go well. NASA has not confirmed that any astronauts have been assigned to Starliner-1.</div>

            <h2>Rubik’s WOWCube adds complexity, possibility by reinventing the puzzle cube</h2>
            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-02-19</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2026/02/rubiks-wowcube-adds-complexity-possibility-by-reinventing-the-puzzle-cube/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">There’s something special about the gadget that “just works.” Technology can open opportunities for those devices but also complicate and weigh down products that have done just fine without things like sensors and software.

So when a product like the beloved Rubik’s Cube gets stuffed with wires, processors, and rechargeable batteries, there’s demand for it to be not just on par with the original—but markedly better.

The Cubios Rubik’s WOWCube successfully breathes fresh life into the classic puzzle, but it’s also an example of when too much technology can cannibalize a gadget’s main appeal.

The WOWCube is a modern take on the Rubik’s Cube, an experiment from Hungarian architecture professor Ernő Rubik. Rubik aimed to make a structure composed of eight cubes that could move independently without the structure collapsing. The Rubik’s Cube became a widely distributed toy, an ’80s craze, and, eventually, a puzzle icon.

The Rubik’s Cube did all that without electronics and with a current MSRP of $10. The WOWCube takes the opposite approach. It’s $399 (as of this writing) and ditches the traditional 3×3 grid in favor of a 2×2 grid that can still do the traditional Rubik’s puzzle (albeit on a smaller scale) and perform a host of other tricks, including playing other games and telling the weather.

The WOWCube’s 2×2 grid will disappoint hardcore puzzlers. There’s no way to play the traditional 3×3 version or even harder modified versions of the 2×2 grid. With only 24 squares, compared to the traditional 54, solving the WOWCube is significantly easier than solving a standard Rubik’s Cube. Although skilled players might enjoy the challenge of trying to solve the WOWCube extra rapidly.

For people who are awful at the original Rubik’s Cube, like this author, a more accessible version of the puzzle is welcome. Solving the new Rubik’s Cube feels more attainable and less frustrating.

The WOWCube is made up of eight modules. Each module has its own PCB, processor, gyroscope, and accelerometer. That may explain why Cubios went with this smaller design. The predicament also begs the question of whether electronics really improve the Rubik’s Cube.

Once I played some of the WOWCube’s other games, I saw the advantage of the smaller grid. The 2×2 layout is more appropriate for games like White Rabbit, which is like Pac-Man but relies on tilting and twisting the cube, or Ladybug, where you twist the cube to create a path for a perpetually crawling ladybug. A central module might add unneeded complexity and space to these games and other WOWCube apps, like Pixel World, which is like a Rubik’s Cube puzzle but with images depicting global landmarks, or the WOWCube implementation of Gabriele Cirulli’s puzzle game, 2048.

At the time of writing, the WOWCube has 15 “games,” including the Rubik’s Cube puzzle. Most of the games are free, but some, such as Space Invaders Cubed ($30) and Sunny Side Up ($5), cost money.

Unlike the original Rubik’s Cube, which is content to live on your shelf until you need a brain exercise or go on a road trip, the WOWCube craves attention with dozens of colorful screens, sound effects, and efforts to be more than a toy.

With its Widgets app open, the cube can display information, like the time, temperature, and alerts, from a limited selection of messaging apps. More advanced actions, like checking the temperature for tomorrow or opening a WhatsApp message, are unavailable. There’s room for improvement, but further development, perhaps around features like an alarm clock or reminders, could turn the WOWCube into a helpful desk companion.

The new technology makes the Rubik’s Cube more versatile, exciting, and useful while bringing the toy back into the spotlight; at times, though, it also brought more complexity to a simple beloved concept.

Usually, to open an app, make a selection, or otherwise input yes, you “knock” on the side of WOWCube twice. You also have to shake the cube three times in order to exit an app, and you can’t open an app when another app is open. Being able to tap an icon or press an actual button would make tasks, like opening apps or controlling volume and brightness levels, easier. On a couple of occasions, my device got buggy and inadvertently turned off some, but not all, of its screens. The reliance on a battery and charging dock that plugs into a wall presents limitations, too.

The WOWCube’s makers brag of the device’s octads of speakers, processors, accelerometer, and gyroscopes, but I found the tilting mechanism unreliable and, at times, frustrating for doing things like highlighting an icon. Perhaps I don’t hold the WOWCube at the angles that its creators intended. There were also times when the image was upside down, and main information was displayed on a side of the cube that was facing away from me.

The WOWCube has its own iOS and Android app, WOWCube Connect, which lets you connect the toy to your phone via Bluetooth and download new apps to the device via the dock’s Wi-Fi connection. You can also use the app to customize things like widgets, screensavers, and display brightness. If you don’t want to do any of those things, you can disconnect the WOWCube from your phone and reconnect it only when you want to.

I wasn’t able to use the iOS app unless I agreed to allow the “app to track activity.” This gives me privacy concerns, and I’ve reached out to Cubios to ask if there’s a way to use the app without the company tracking your activity.

Cubios attempted to reinvent a classic puzzle with the WOWCube. In the process, it added bells and whistles that detract from what originally made Rubik’s Cubes great.

The actual Rubik’s Cube puzzle is scaled back, and the idea of spending hours playing with the cube is hindered by its finite battery life (the WOWCube can last up to five hours of constant play, Cubios claims). The device’s reliance on sensors and chips doesn’t always yield a predictable user experience, especially when navigating apps. And all of its tech makes the puzzle about 40 times pricier than the classic toy.

IPS screens, integrated speakers, and app integration add more possibilities, but some might argue that the Rubik’s Cube was sufficient without them. Notably, the WOWCube began as its own product and got the rights to use Rubik’s branding in 2024.

We’ve seen technology come for the Rubik’s Cube before. The Rubik’s Revolution we tested years ago had pressure-sensitive, LED-lit buttons for faces. In 2020, Rubik’s Connected came out with its own companion app. Clearly, there’s interest in bringing the Rubik’s Cube into the 20th century. For those who believe in that mission, the WOWCube is a fascinating new chapter for the puzzle.

I applaud Cubios’ efforts to bring the Rubik’s Cube new relevance and remain intrigued by the potential of new software-driven puzzles and uses. But it’s hard to overlook the downfalls of its tech reliance.

And the WOWCube could never replace the classic.</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Diablo II is one of those storied classic PC games that’s pretty much always fun to come back to—so much so that some players have put thousands of hours into the game over more than two decades. Across all those years, though, the game itself has barely changed, becoming something of a familiar, comfortable blanket of hellfire for longtime players.

That makes last week’s introduction of a new playable Warlock class in Diablo II Resurrected’s new “Reign of the Warlock” DLC a pretty big deal. And after playing through a few Acts with the Warlock over the recent holiday weekend, I found the new option to be a great excuse to come back to a game that’s overdue for a shot in the arm.

How your Warlock build goes depends heavily on which of the three main upgrade branches you choose to go down. Of these, I found the Eldritch branch had been the most interesting and fun to explore. That’s in large part because of a new skill that lets you levitate a powerful two-handed weapon in front of you while still holding a strong shield in your hands. It seems like a small change, but my relief was palpable in this playthrough as I was able to avoid these kinds of tough choices between defense and offense as I juggled my inventory.

Then there’s the Echoing Strike skill, which essentially lets you turn your melee weapons into ranged attacks, using a bit of mana to throw a ghostly “echo” at far-off enemies. I ended up relying heavily on this almost as soon as I got it at Level 14, spamming a long-range copy of my powerful two-handed staff, complete with its fire and poison effects intact. Like weapon levitation, adding an effective ranged attack to what were once exclusively close-quarters combat options is a simple change that opens up a lot of gameplay variety.

The Demon upgrade branch has been much less interesting, in my experience. The basic pattern of summoning monstrous allies to fight alongside you and absorb some enemy attention will be broadly familiar to anyone who has played the Necromancer class. And, to be frank, I found summoning a massive army of fragile skeletons as a Necromancer to be a lot more fun than summoning a singular tank of a Demon as a Warlock early on (summoning multiple demons at once requires a full 10 points of skill tree investment).

Of the Warlock’s three Demonic partner options, I found myself leaning most on the Tainted, which can stay out of harm’s way while harassing slower enemies from afar with fireballs. The other Demon options both had their charms but often got too caught up in massive enemy swarms to be as effective as I wanted, I found. I also didn’t see much point in the skill option that let me teleport my demon into a specific fight or sacrifice itself for some splash damage; their standard, AI-controlled attack patterns were usually sufficient.

Then there’s the Chaos upgrade branch, which is focused mostly on area-of-effect (AoE) spells. My build thus far has ended up pretty reliant on the direct-damage AoE options; the Flame Wave, in particular, is especially good for quickly clearing out long, narrow corridors. I also leaned on the Sigil of Lethargy, which effectively slows down some of the more frenetic enemy swarms and gives you some time to gather your attack plan.

Combining these Chaos skills with the weapon-improving options in the Eldritch branch has made my time with the Diablo II Warlock feel like a bit of a “best of both worlds” situation. The mixture of ranged combat options, area-of-effect magic, and allies-summoning abilities ends up feeling like a weird cross between a Sorceress, Amazon, and Necromancer, without feeling like a carbon copy of any of those classes.

I haven’t yet gotten to the new late-game content in the “Reign of the Warlock” DLC, so I can’t say how well the Warlock holds up in the extreme difficulty of the Terror Zones. I also haven’t experimented with any of the truly broken Warlock builds that some committed high-level min-maxxers have been busy discovering.

As a casual excuse to revisit the world of Diablo II, though, the Warlock class provides just enough of a new twist on some familiar gameplay mechanics to make it worth the trip.</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">There’s no love being lost between Sam Altman and Dario Amodei.

At India’s AI Summit in New Delhi on Thursday, the respective CEOs of OpenAI and Athropic shared the stage with roughly a dozen other industry and political leaders, including the nation’s prime minister Narendra Modi. As they stood in a line facing the crowd, Modi beckoned them to join hands and raise them above their heads, presenting a united front.

Except Altman and Amodei, whose companies are bitter rivals, didn’t follow suit. Instead of holding hands, there’s only a brief moment of awkward eye contact as they largely avoid looking at each other, with Amodei searching around himself in a kind of “who, me?” gesture — which, had it been on a different kind of stage, would be hailed as a great bit of comic acting. In the end, both Altman and Amodei elected to raise a closed fist with the hands they should’ve been locking.

It was, as one Redditor described, a “cringe masterpiece.” Amodei did not look particularly thrilled. Altman, as he waited for Amodei’s final decision, held his free hand in front of his chest, seemingly confused.

It heightened what was already an absurd spectacle. The leaders of an industry that promises utopia on the horizon were smiling as they showed support for a prime minister who’s been widely criticized as authoritarian, all holding hands like they’re about to play ring around the rosie.

The rivalry between OpenAI and Anthropic goes deep. Anthropic was formed from a splinter group of former OpenAI employees, including Amodei, who left the company because of differences over its direction and to focus on safety.

But it’s recently reached new heights. This month, Anthropic piled pressure onto OpenAI with a new series of Super Bowl commercials that were a thinly-veiled dig at OpenAI’s decision to start shoving advertisements into ChatGPT.

And it clearly struck a nerve. Altman unbecomingly responded with a lengthy rant on X, accusing the Anthropic ads of being “deceptive” and suggesting that Anthropic was an “authoritarian company.” That’s while admitting he thought the ads were “funny,” as if to convince us that he could take a joke, and not be having the mini-meltdown that he was clearly experiencing.

The two companies are also poised to lock heads over shaping the industry’s regulation. Last week, Anthropic announced it would pour $20 million into a super PAC formed to combat another super PAC backed by key OpenAI figures and investors. Anthropic’s side is fighting for stronger AI regulation, while OpenAI’s favors a laissez-faire playing field. Among other things, the money will go to the campaigns of favored candidates ahead of the upcoming midterm elections.

            <h2>New Platform Lets You Gamble on CCTV Footage</h2>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Thanks to the rise of sports betting and prediction markets, gambling has turned from an activity sequestered to casinos and scratch tickets into something that practically anybody with an internet connection can dive into headfirst — something that has experts warning of a surge in gambling addiction, especially among young, impressionable minds.

Platforms like Polymarket mean that gamblers are no longer limited to betting their hard-earned cash on red or black during a game of roulette or mindlessly pulling the lever of a slot machine — now they can bet on whether Jesus Christ will return before the long-awaited release of the video game “GTA VI,” or by what date the United States will strike Iran.

And now, a new gambling game called Rush Hour CCTV on the crypto casino platform Roobet is taking the phenomenon to an even more ludicrous conclusion. As casino publication Win.gg points out, gamblers there are betting on how many cars, trucks, buses, motorcycles, or pedestrians are crossing a specific point within a predetermined time period on a street in live, licensed CCTV footage being streamed from big cities, including Tokyo, Bangkok, New York, and London.

It may sound banal — and it many ways it is — but instead of relying on traditional random number generator mechanics (RNG) that determine the outcome in slot machines, the new game relies on the real world instead.

The game is deceptively simple. Each round kicks off with a simple message: “How many vehicles?”

Gamblers can then bet on how many vehicles will cross a point within the next 55 seconds. They can also give a range as an answer, which will give a significantly lower payout than guessing the exact number.

It’s a dystopian glimpse into a largely unregulated crypto gambling world. Even in China, where online gambling — including crypto-based prediction markets like Polymarket — is illegal, the trend has surged in popularity. As Rest of World reports, the company has been hiring Mandarin-speaking staff, with trading volumes across Asia hitting “hundreds of millions” of dollars a month.

Crypto casinos like Roobet, which is hosting Rush Hour CCTV, have seen revenues surge despite widespread bans. Users have been using virtual private networks, mirror links, and redirecting URLs to get around restrictions.

Crypto gambling market reached an estimated $81 billion last year, according to Bitcoin.com, and analysts predict this year will be no different, in large part thanks to the proliferation of stablecoins, which are often pegged to far more stable fiat currencies.

Meanwhile, popular streamers are roping in new users, enticing them with simple crypto casino games. Even underage users can circumvent restrictions by using false identities, as the New York Times reported last year.

Online celebrities — including renowned music artists like Aubrey “Drake” Graham and Calvin “Snoop Dogg” Broadus — are gambling during livestreams, effectively encouraging fans to get hooked themselves.

Whether regulators will step up to the plate to ensure that trend won’t turn into a crisis remains unclear. The Trump administration has been particularly amenable, stacking regulatory committees with CEOs of prediction markets, crypto companies, and sports betting apps.

In other words, chances are that even more young people will be enticed to bet on how many vehicles will pass by in CCTV footage.

Worse yet, awareness of the risks of gambling addiction is lagging far behind.

“We can’t keep up with the most popular streamers that are on the internet,” Queens Problem Gambling Resource Center team leader Robin Singh told the NYT last year. “That’s the problem, unfortunately, that the issue spreads way faster than the solution does.”

            <h2>Amazon’s Shiny New Warehouse Robot Just Failed in Spectacular Style</h2>
            <p><strong>Futurism | 2026-02-19</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://futurism.com/robots-and-machines/amazon-warehouse-robot-failed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">In October, Amazon proudly announced a new warehouse robot made up of multiple robotic arms called Blue Jay, which alongside an AI system would “reduce repetitive tasks, improve safety, and boost productivity — while speeding up delivery.”

“Visually, Blue Jay operates like a juggler who never drops a ball — only here, the ‘balls’ are tens of thousands of items moving at high speed,” the company rhapsodized at the time. “It’s also like a conductor leading an orchestra, with every motion in harmony.”

Now the whole thing has turned into an embarrassing debacle. As inside sources told Business Insider, the tech giant quietly pulled its Blue Jay robot just months after its announcement, undermining its claims of taking advantage of recent advancements in AI tech.

Spokesperson Terrence Clark told BI that the core tech of the multi-arm robot will be repurposed elsewhere. It remains unclear why exactly Amazon chose to mothball the robot.

“We’re always experimenting with new ways to improve the customer experience and make work safer, more efficient, and more engaging for our employees,” Clark said. “In this case, we’re actually accelerating the use of the underlying technology developed for Blue Jay, and nearly all of the technologies are being carried over and will continue to support employees across our network,” the spokesperson told TechCrunch in a separate statement.

Clark also said that Blue Jay was a prototype, although Amazon’s October press release didn’t mention anything about that.

The failed experiment highlights how difficult it is to carry over recent advancements in AI into the real world. Reality is far messier and more unpredictable than a digital environment, requiring algorithms to continually adjust.

Amazon’s response also underlines the company’s commitment to eventually automating its warehouses with robots. As the New York Times reported the day before the company showed off its Blue Jay robot, Amazon is secretly looking to eventually replace more than 600,000 jobs with robots.

There’s been immense buzz over the past few years about human-free “dark factories” — entirely automated facilities that don’t require lighting, heating, or air conditioning, that are starting to crop up in China.

Companies are also betting big on humanoid robots, which could eventually take over many tasks currently being fulfilled by humans.

But as the latest developments go to show, the tech needed to fulfill human jobs still needs plenty of work. Meanwhile, the pressure on companies to deliver on their lofty promises, especially when it comes to AI, continues to grow.

Amazon has committed to spending $200 billion to build out AI infrastructure this year alone, a lofty sum that had investors rattled earlier this month.

However, whether its failed robot will matter much in the long run is unlikely. Just earlier today, news emerged that Amazon had surpassed Walmart as the world’s largest company, measured by sales, a momentous occasion highlighting the e-commerce behemoth’s continuing dominance. Shares, however, remained steady following the news, suggesting a lingering wariness among investors.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The immense hype surrounding AI has caused enormous data centers to crop up across the country, triggering significant opposition. It’s not just the loss of land: enormous power needs are pushing the grid into meltdown and driving up local electricity prices, catching the attention of politicians and their irate constituents.

One 86-year-old farmer in Cumberland County, Pennsylvania, has heard enough. As local Fox affiliate WPMT reports, Mervin Raudabaugh, who has farmed the surrounding land for more than 60 years, turned down more than $15 million from data center developers in a package deal that involved three neighboring property owners as well.

The farmer was offered $60,000 per acre to build a data center on his property. But giving up his family legacy wasn’t in the cards for him.

“I was not interested in destroying my farms,” he told WPMT. “That was the bottom line. It really wasn’t so much the economic end of it. I just didn’t want to see these two farms destroyed.”

Instead, he sold the development rights in December for just under $2 million to a conservation trust, taking a significant loss but guaranteeing that it would stay farmland in perpetuity.

Users on social media called him a “legend,” and argued he had “more integrity than the whole government.”

“Now that is a real hero in these gutless times!” another user tweeted.

“$15M is huge, but clean water, quiet land, and legacy don’t have a price tag,” another user argued.

The sheer amount of land being earmarked to construct enormous energy and water-sucking data centers is remarkable. A data center in Mount Pleasant, Wisconsin, is set to take up 600 acres, which could cost local residents their land, as ABC News reported this week. Another octogenarian farmer, the 83-year-old Tom Uttech, who has lived on his 52-acre Wisconsin property for almost 40 years, told the broadcaster that he “couldn’t believe” that a local utility company was looking to build “power lines that are 300 or something feet tall, taller than apparently the Statue of Liberty,” through his land to power the data center.

Per ABC, there are more than 3,000 data centers in the US, a number that will soon grow by 1,200 more, which are currently being constructed.

But few, apart from salivating tech company executives, are particularly keen on the idea. And the growing backlash to the AI industry has gotten the attention of politicians. New York lawmakers recently announced a new bill that would impose a three-year moratorium on developing new data centers in the state, at least the sixth state to introduce such legislation, as Wired reported earlier this month.

Meanwhile, industry leaders are looking for an alternative, suggesting launching data centers into space instead. While it could certainly ensure that no more precious farmland is being used up, it remains to be seen whether it’s even remotely feasible, both physically and financially.

“It breaks my heart to think of what’s going to take place here, because only the land that’s preserved here is going to be here,” Raudabaugh told WPMT. “The rest of every square inch is going to get built on. The American farm family is definitely in trouble.”

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Investors have been rattled by the enormous amount of money AI companies are committing to spend on infrastructure buildouts. Amazon alone saw its share price drop precipitously earlier this month after announcing that it’s planning to spend $200 billion this year on AI. Microsoft’s shares also plummeted after stoking fears that a return on AI investment may be even further off than expected.

In total, big tech companies are predicted to spend a record-breaking $650 billion on AI in 2026 alone, astronomical commitments that have Wall Street seriously on edge.

Fears over an AI bubble continue to grow as analysts warn that companies are massively overinvesting. According to a new Bank of America survey of 162 fund managers, a significant 35 percent said corporations are overinvesting in capital expenditures — funds used by a company to acquire, upgrade, and maintain physical assets — at a record proportion compared to previous survey results spanning the last 20 years. Only 20 percent said they approved of increasing capital expenditures.

An AI bubble is a clear focus. A full 25 percent of survey respondents said they see the AI bubble as the largest risk — even more so than inflation and geopolitical conflict. And 30 percent said that AI expenditures were the most likely source of a credit crisis.

In short, the survey results paint a dire picture of the current state of the market, blinking warning signs that big tech companies are spreading themselves too thin by continuing to hemorrhage tens of billions of dollars each quarter.

Meanwhile, tech leaders continue to justify their enormous spending, with Google CEO Sundar Pichai touting the present moment as “extraordinary” and “transformational,” during the AI Summit in New Delhi, India, on Wednesday, comparing the AI boom to the industrial revolution, “but ten times faster and ten times larger.”

AI chipmaker Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang also attempted to calm spooked investors this week, arguing AI investments are just the beginning.

“I would say clients are justified in being worried [about an AI bubble] because there’s a lot of uncertainty,” Orbis Investments advisor Ben Preston told the Financial Times.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">According to Elon Musk, xAI’s Grok chatbot has a new bona fide: blatantly lying about the history of America.

On Wednesday, the centi-billionaire culture warrior boasted that the “4.20” version of his is officially “BASED.” Why? Because it won’t “equivocate” when it’s asked if the US is built on stolen land. Instead, it gives an emphatic no as its answer, while other “weak sauce” models — in Musk’s words, at least — give a more nuanced response.

“No, the United States is not simply ‘on stolen land,&#39;” Grok says in a screenshotted conversation shared by its creator. “That framing is a modern rhetorical slogan that oversimplifies thousands of years of human history, layered claims to territory, legal doctrines, treaties, warfare, migration, and demographic collapse.”

The reality, of course, is that it’s hard to argue that the ruthless killing, enslavement, and displacement of Native Americans by European settlers doesn’t amount to their land being stolen. This pattern of behavior continued well after the colonies graduated into a full-blown nation: the Trail of Tears, Wounded Knee, plus countless other massacres, not to mention centuries of brutal residential schools. However complicated it might be, the answer to whether the US was built on stolen land can’t be boiled down to a simple “no.”

How competing chatbots approach the question varies. In Musk’s screenshot, ChatGPT, says the “short answer” is yes: “much of the land that is now the United States was taken through conquest, coercion, broken treaties, or forced removal of Indigenous peoples.” Claude 4.6 delicately approaches it by acknowledging that it’s a “contested question” and presents the case for both the yes and no arguments.

We don’t recommend using hallucination-prone AIs for research, but if he had to, we’d probably pick one of the chatbots that lay out the facts and debate, instead of subjecting ourselves to a moralizing rant from an AI best known for calling itself “MechaHitler” and generating nudes of people without their consent.

But Musk seems proud of his chatbot’s response, which is essentially providing ideologues with a comforting yet oversimplified version of history.

“Every square inch of habitable land on Earth has changed hands through conquest, migration, purchase, or displacement multiple times — long before 1492 and everywhere else on the planet,” Grok fumes, as you probably begin to imagine an Elon Musk-shaped claw puppeting its mouth.

This boast is the latest example of Musk’s commitment to tampering with Grok so that it reflects his personal worldview. He has repeatedly admonished Grok after he caught it citing mainstream news sources that didn’t align with his far-right beliefs. Last summer, the chatbot suspiciously began parroting talking points in response to completely unrelated posts about a supposed “white genocide” in South Africa, a racist conspiracy theory that Musk, a white South African, believes in. Months later, it suddenly began praising Musk to a preposterous degree, leading to declarations that he was a greater mind than Isaac Newton and better role model than Jesus Christ. Musk’s goal of rewriting reality reached its apotheosis with the launch of “Grokipedia,” an AI-generated and Grok-edited alternative to Wikipedia, which conspicuously defended the Cybertruck and cited actual Nazi websites.

But ironically, even Grok may not be “BASED.” When we asked it about the US being on stolen land, it gave a very different answer to the one Musk was gloating about.

“The United States, as it exists today, was indeed largely built on lands that were originally inhabited and controlled by Indigenous peoples,” Grok replied, “and much of that land was acquired through processes that many historians and legal scholars describe as theft, coercion, or violation of treaties.”

Abu Dhabi-based tech company G42 has partnered with U.S.-based chipmaker Cerebras to deploy 8 exaflops of computing power via a new supercomputer system in India, the companies said on the sidelines of the India AI Impact Summit in New Delhi.

The system will be hosted in India and follow local data residency, security, and compliance rules. The project aims to provide computing resources for AI applications to educational institutions, government entities, and small and medium enterprises.

“Sovereign AI infrastructure is becoming essential for national competitiveness. This project brings that capability to India at a national scale, enabling local researchers, innovators, and enterprises to become AI-native while maintaining full data sovereignty and security,” Manu Jain, CEO of G42 India, said in a statement.

Abu Dhabi’s Mohamed bin Zayed University of Artificial Intelligence (MBZUAI) and India’s Centre for Development of Advanced Computing (C-DAC) are also part of the project. Last year, MBZUAI and G42 released Nanda 87B, a Hindi-English large language model built on Meta’s Llama 3.1 70B model, that is purported to understand casual speech in Hindi and English.

“Deploying this system in India marks a significant step forward in the country’s computational capacity and sovereign AI initiatives. It will accelerate training and inference for large-scale models, enabling researchers and developers to build AI tailored to India’s needs,” said Andy Hock, chief strategy officer at Cerebras.

The India AI Impact Summit this week saw several AI infrastructure initiatives being launched by both Indian giants and international firms.

Indian conglomerate Adani pledged $100 billion to build up to 5 gigawatts of data-center capacity in the country by 2035. Reliance also said it would invest $110 billion over the next seven years for gigawatt-scale data centers.

OpenAI has teamed up with Tata Group to secure 100 megawatts of AI compute in the country as part of its Stargate project, and eventually scale it to 1 gigawatts. And India’s technology minister Ashwini Vaishnaw said at the summit that the country plans to attract over $200 billion in infrastructure investment over the next two years by rolling out a mix of tax incentives, state-backed venture capital, and policy support.

So far, U.S. technology giants, including Amazon, Google, and Microsoft, have already committed about $70 billion to expand AI and cloud infrastructure in the country.

General Catalyst, a Silicon Valley-based venture firm with more than $43 billion in assets under management, has announced it plans to invest $5 billion in India over the next five years, sharply expanding its push into the country’s startup ecosystem less than two years after merging with local venture firm Venture Highway.

The commitment, unveiled at the India AI Impact Summit in New Delhi on Friday, will target startups across artificial intelligence, healthcare, defense technology, fintech, and consumer technology. The announcement marks a significant increase from the $500 million to $1 billion the firm had previously earmarked for India.

India, the world’s most populous country with more than a billion internet users, is positioning itself as a major AI investment destination. New Delhi aims to attract over $200 billion in AI infrastructure investments over the next two years as it hosts the India AI Impact Summit with participation from companies, including OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google.

“India will build the next generation of global platform companies,” General Catalyst CEO Hemant Taneja (pictured above) said, adding that the firm sees Indian founders as uniquely positioned to develop technology for markets serving enormous populations.

General Catalyst said it sees India’s biggest AI opportunity in large-scale real-world deployment rather than in building so-called frontier models. The firm cited the country’s government-built digital infrastructure, vast domestic market, and deep services talent pool as reasons for that view.

The push comes as India’s AI ambitions accelerate. At the summit, conglomerates Adani Group and Reliance Industries, led by billionaire Mukesh Ambani, announced plans to invest more than $200 billion combined to build AI data center infrastructure in the country. OpenAI has separately partnered with Tata Group’s TCS — one of India’s largest tech companies — to develop a 100-megawatt AI data center as part of the expansion of its Stargate infrastructure project. In recent months, global tech companies including Amazon, Google, and Microsoft have also outlined tens of billions of dollars in cloud and AI investments in the country.

General Catalyst has been building its India portfolio across fast delivery e-commerce, health tech, and deep tech, with investments including Zepto, PB Health, Raphe, Jeh Aerospace, Pronto, and Ayr Energy.

“This investment allows us to operate at a different scale in India,” Neeraj Arora, General Catalyst’s CEO for India, the Middle East, and North Africa, said, adding that the firm aims to support companies from early stage through to the public markets.

General Catalyst said it is developing a framework to accelerate large-scale AI adoption across priority sectors in India, aiming to help convert pilot projects into full deployments. The firm’s General Catalyst Institute has also been working to build government-industry partnerships in the country.

For the most sought-after founders, the prestige of a top-tier accelerator is increasingly weighed against giving up a significant ownership stake in their company.

Ali Partovi, the veteran investor and CEO of venture firm Neo, wants to offer the mentorship and community of one of the most elite accelerator programs—without forcing the best up-and-coming tech leaders to hand over 7% or even 10% of their company before they’ve even started.

Partovi, who is known for his early investments in Facebook, Cursor, and Kalshi, has just introduced Neo Residency, a new, competitively structured program that combines the firm’s now four-year-old accelerator with a track for current college students.

The terms that Neo Residency offers are so founder-friendly as to be “not even comparable to any other accelerator,” Partovi told TechCrunch.

For the cohort of 12 to 15 startups entering the program this summer, Neo will invest $750,000 via an uncapped SAFE — a contract that gives an investor future equity in exchange for money now, with no ceiling on the valuation used to calculate that stake. Unlike the fixed-percentage deals typical of other accelerators, Neo won’t receive its equity until the company’s next formal funding round, and even then, the dilution is tied to valuation. If a startup raises its next round at a $15 million valuation, Neo’s stake will be 5%, but if that valuation hits $100 million, the firm’s ownership drops to just 0.75%.

“We take the risk up front, so this is extremely favorable to startups,” Partovi said.

In comparison, Y Combinator typically takes a fixed 7% of the company for $125,000, with another $375,000 invested on an uncapped MFN — or most-favored nation — SAFE, a clause that ensures early investors get terms at least as good as those given to later ones. Meanwhile, Andreessen Horowitz’s Speedrun program typically invests $500,000 in exchange for 10% of the startup via a SAFE note, and another $500,000 if the next round is raised within 18 months at whatever terms are agreed to by the other investors.

“We’re offering a deal so great that it’s appropriate even for founders who are not even considering any other accelerator,” Partovi said.

The lower equity cost is only part of Neo Residency’s appeal.

The founders will work for three months at Neo’s offices in San Francisco’s Jackson Square district, participate in a two-week bootcamp in the Oregon mountains, and be mentored by about 30 experienced operators, including Russell Kaplan, president of Cognition, and Fuzzy Khosrowshahi, CTO of Notion (and the creator of Google Sheets and also Partovi’s uncle).

But the program’s main draw is its prestige: Seed and Series A investors generally have great respect for founders handpicked by Partovi.

“The one [accelerator] I like right now that has very high signal, and every founder I met there is just wicked smart, is Neo,” Wesley Chan, co-founder and managing partner of FPV Ventures, said on stage at 2025 TechCrunch Disrupt.

Startups that have gone through the program include Moment, a fintech company that has raised $56 million from investors like Andreessen Horowitz, and Anterior, a healthcare AI startup backed by NEA and Sequoia.

The Neo Residency will also select five to eight students—either as individuals or small teams—who will receive a $40,000, no-strings-attached grant to take a semester off to work on a project. While there is no requirement to drop out or start a formal company immediately, Partovi said he hopes the students will catch the entrepreneurial bug and, when they eventually launch a startup, turn to Neo for funding.

Neo is keeping the program small and elite: it will cap its two annual cohorts at 20 teams each, consisting of a mix of active startups and student projects.

Why is Neo offering such generous terms? “We have more confidence in our ability to attract and pick out future superstars than ever before,” Partovi said.

His track record suggests that confidence is well-founded. He famously met Cursor co-founder Michael Truell while Truell was still an MIT student and later wrote one of the first checks into the AI coding startup, now valued at nearly $30 billion.

On Thursday, Google released the newest version of Gemini Pro, its powerful LLM. The model, 3.1, is currently available as a preview and will be generally released soon, the company said.

Google’s new model may be one of the most powerful LLMs yet. Onlookers have noted that Gemini 3.1 Pro appears to be a big step up from its predecessor, Gemini 3 — which, upon its release in November, was already considered a highly capable AI tool.

On Thursday, Google also shared statistics from independent benchmarks — such as one called Humanity’s Last Exam — that showed it performing significantly better than its previous version.

Gemini 3.1 Pro was also praised by Brendan Foody, the CEO of AI startup Mercor, whose benchmarking system, APEX, is designed to measure how well new AI models perform real professional tasks. “Gemini 3.1 Pro is now at the top of the APEX-Agents leaderboard,” Foody said in a social media post, adding that the model’s impressive results show “how quickly agents are improving at real knowledge work.”

The release comes as the AI model wars are heating up, and tech companies continue to release increasingly powerful LLMs designed for agentic work and multi-step reasoning. Other major names — including OpenAI and Anthropic — have recently released new models as well.

Nvidia is stepping up efforts to court India’s artificial intelligence startups earlier in their lifecycle, unveiling a string of partnerships this week aimed at reaching founders even before their companies are formally established. The push is intended to help the AI chipmaker cultivate relationships with future customers in one of the world’s fastest-growing developer markets.

The latest move comes through a partnership with early-stage venture firm Activate, which plans to back about 25 to 30 AI startups from its $75 million debut fund while giving portfolio companies preferential access to Nvidia’s technical expertise. The collaboration follows other India-focused efforts unveiled this week, including work with nonprofit AI Grants India to support early-stage founders and new ties with venture firms focused on the South Asian nation.

The flurry of activity comes as India hosts its AI Impact Summit in New Delhi, drawing top technology companies including OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google. Nvidia Chief Executive Jensen Huang was slated to attend but skipped the event due to what the company called unforeseen circumstances. A senior delegation led by executive vice president Jay Puri attended in his place, meeting AI researchers, startups, developers, and partners on the ground.

India has emerged as one of the fastest-growing pools of AI developers and startups, making it an increasingly important market for Nvidia as it looks to expand adoption of chips and computing software. By working more closely with founders at the earliest stages, the company is positioning itself to capture long-term demand as new AI-native companies scale.

Aakrit Vaish, founder of Activate, said Nvidia’s engagement with startups in India has historically been relatively light-touch compared with the U.S., but the chipmaker is now looking to work with founders much earlier in their journey. Activate aims to leverage that shift by connecting portfolio startups directly with Nvidia experts.

The VC firm, which Vaish describes as focused on “inception investing,” meets technical teams months before company formation and works closely with them as they grow. Its backers include venture capitalist Vinod Khosla, Perplexity co-founder Aravind Srinivas, Peak XV managing director Shailendra Singh, and Paytm CEO Vijay Shekhar Sharma, underlining the prominent network Activate is assembling around its early-stage strategy.

For Nvidia, the logic behind partnering with an early-stage venture firm is straightforward: the earlier it builds relationships with promising AI startups, the more likely those companies are to rely on its computing infrastructure as they scale. Vaish told TechCrunch that growing startups typically consume increasing amounts of AI compute over time, making early technical engagement valuable for the chipmaker as a way of generating future business.

Nvidia already has a sizable presence in the country through its Inception program, which supports more than 4,000 startups in India. This week, the chipmaker also expanded its local ecosystem ties, including partnerships with venture firms such as Accel, Peak XV, Z47, Elevation Capital, and Nexus Venture Partners to identify and fund AI startups. It separately teamed up with AI Grants India, co-founded by Vaibhav Domkundwar and Bhasker (Bosky) Kode, to support more than 10,000 early-stage founders over the next 12 months.

The company has also been broadening its startup outreach in India over time. In November 2025, Nvidia joined the India Deep Tech Alliance, a consortium of U.S. and Indian investors including Accel, Blume Ventures, Premji Invest, and Celesta Capital, to provide strategic and technical guidance to emerging startups in the country.

Vaish said Activate’s partnership with Nvidia is designed to provide a more curated layer on top of the company’s broad-based Inception program, which serves thousands of startups globally. By serving as an early filter for high-potential technical teams, Activate aims to give its portfolio companies more direct, timely access to Nvidia’s engineering expertise.

The stepped-up activity underscores intensifying competition among global technology firms to court AI developers and startups in India, which has become one of the fastest-growing pools of technical talent outside the U.S.

In 2010, the famed security researcher Barnaby Jack spectacularly hacked into an ATM cash machine onstage at the Black Hat security conference, forcing it to spit out reams of bank notes in front of an awestruck audience.

More than a decade later, ATM jackpotting — as it’s called — has broken free from the realms of theoretical security research into big business in the criminal world.

According to a new security bulletin issued by the FBI, hackers have rapidly ramped up their attacks in recent years, with more than 700 attacks on cash dispensers during 2025 alone, netting hackers at least $20 million in stolen cash.

Per the bulletin, the FBI says hackers are using a mix of physical access to ATM machines, such as generic keys for unlocking front panels and accessing hard drives, and digital tools, like planting malware that can force ATMs to rapidly dispense cash in a flash.

The FBI warned that one particular malware, known as Ploutus, affects a variety of ATM manufacturers and cash dispensers by targeting the underlying Windows operating system that powers many ATMs. Ploutus grants the hackers full control over a compromised ATM, allowing them to issue instructions capable of tricking the dispenser into disbursing notes without drawing funds from customer accounts.

Ploutus takes advantage of extensions for financial services, or XFS software, which ATMs rely on to communicate with its various other hardware components, such as the PIN keypad, the card reader, and the all-important cash dispensing unit.

“Ploutus attacks the ATM itself rather than customer accounts, enabling fast cash-out operations that can occur in minutes and are often difficult to detect until after the money is withdrawn,” per the FBI bulletin.

Security researchers previously found issues with XFS software that can allow hackers to trick ATMs into dispensing cash.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Killing thousands of protesters last month was apparently not enough for the Islamic Republic, which followed up by arresting prominent internal critics, too. The Iranian regime wouldn’t have gone after these figures if it didn’t fear them—perhaps even as much as it fears the royalist movement that has surged around former Crown Prince Reza Pahlavi. Its sensitivity about both groups is a reminder that uniting them remains the Iranian opposition’s best move, if only activists would take it.

On January 31, the domestic oppositionists Abdollah Momeni, Mehdi Mahmoudian, and Vida Rabbani were swept up and sent to prisons in northern Iran, far from their Tehran residences. They were released on bail on February 17. Mahmoudian’s case attracted international attention because he is the Oscar-nominated screenwriter of Jafar Panahi’s 2025 film, It Was Just an Accident. All three figures were once associated with the regime’s internal movement for incremental reform; all three long ago abandoned that stance to advocate the wholesale transformation of the system instead.

Last month, the three arrested activists had joined two like-minded figures—former Deputy Interior Minister Mostafa Tajzadeh and the Nobel laureate Narges Mohammadi, both in prison—in calling for a democratic transition and free elections for a constituent assembly. In an interview with BBC Persian, Mahmoudian called on Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei to resign. Hassan Asadi Zeydabadi, a lawyer who represents Rabbani and Momeni, told me that his clients were most likely arrested because they advocated for Khamenei’s dismissal and because “the regime wants to prevent the formation of a national opposition inside the country.”

Arash Azizi: The Islamic Republic will not last

Iran’s regime still does have a reformist faction that functions as its loyal opposition. The reformists participate in the political system as elected representatives; they gently push some of the autocracy’s boundaries but largely defer to the authority of the supreme leader. Iran’s president, Masoud Pezeshkian, is a reformist. He owes his presidency to the active support of the Iranian Reformist Front. On February 8 or 9, that organization’s leader, Azar Mansouri, was arrested alongside several of her colleagues, including Javad Emam and Ebrahim Asgharzadeh, and detained until their release on bail on February 13 and 14. During the Women, Life, Freedom protests of 2022, regime leaders held meetings with Mansouri, ostensibly to address the people’s demands. This time, it accused her of “undermining national unity” and “coordinating with enemy propaganda.”

The Islamic Republic has the jitters. Anahita Hosseini-Lewis, an expert on Iran at Birkbeck, University of London, told me that the system is suffering from an “acute existential anxiety.” In part, that’s because the imperative to replace the Islamic Republic has become something close to a consensus across the Iranian opposition, and the regime’s operatives know it. Last month, a number of regime critics inside the country, including Mansouri and other reformists, embraced an initiative called the National Assembly for the Salvation of Iran, which planned to set forth a charter of demands for fundamental change. The initiative had hardly gotten off the ground but was likely the catalyst for the arrests, a source close to the reformists told me, speaking on condition of anonymity for fear of reprisal.

As Hosseini-Lewis pointed out, the Islamic Republic has a “long-standing strategy of preventing domestically rooted alternatives from taking shape.” Its effort to stanch domestic movements and silence their leaders has been successful enough that many Iranians now look abroad, to Pahlavi, the exiled son of the former shah of Iran, who hasn’t been to Iran since 1978. But some inside Iran worry both that the royalist movement has become brittle and non-inclusive, and that the former crown prince lacks experience inside the country.

Mohammad Karim Asayesh, an urban activist in Tehran, told me that he knows Momeni, Mahmoudian, and Rabbani, and prefers them to exiled leaders such as Pahlavi, whom he considers inept and undemocratic.

“Unlike Pahlavi, these three have a history of activism inside the country and they’ve paid a price for it,” he said. “They’ve harbored an ethical and responsible politics, have remained patriotic. And the fact that they are living in Iran means that they are more attuned to the realities of the Iranian people compared to Pahlavi, who hasn’t lived in Iran since he was 18.”

The three arrested figures are also all in their 40s, which makes them significantly younger than most Iranian political eminences and more connected to the country’s youth.

The filmmaker Jafar Panahi told me that he got to know Mahmoudian when they were in Tehran’s Evin Prison together, and that he particularly admired the sense of responsibility Mahmoudian showed toward others in captivity. The screenwriter has already spent nine years of his life behind bars and is “a rare ethical witness,” Panahi said.

But Hosseini-Lewis cautioned me that the three former reformists don’t “currently function as a viable anti-regime leadership, either individually or collectively.” An activist in Tehran, who asked that I withhold her name for safety reasons, told me of Momeni, Rabbani, and Mahmoudian, “Their courage is admirable, and they’ve taken the right positions. But the regime has created mistrust toward everybody, and their reformist pasts limit their prospects.”

Iran’s opposition spans a wide gamut—reformist, republican, and monarchist; domestic and international. Forging a broad coalition across these tendencies seems like an obvious necessity but has so far proved elusive. Amir Hossein Ganjbakhsh, a political activist based in the United States, advocates for bringing Pahlavi’s supporters together with those of Mirhossein Mousavi, the former prime minister who became the symbolic leader of the Green Movement and has languished under house arrest since 2011. Mousavi started out an ardent Islamist, became a reformist, and has called for a democratic transition since 2023.

Nancy A. Youssef and Vivian Salama: Why the U.S. hasn’t yet struck Iran

“These two men matter symbolically, as two ends of a spectrum, the two sides of the 1979 revolution,” Ganjbakhsh told me. “But the coalition can also include everybody in between. Without losing our historical identities, we can join up together.” Even Mansouri and her colleagues in the Iranian Reformist Front could be part of this, Ganjbakhsh suggested, given that they have shown sympathy for the protesters and have paid for it with the charges against them.

The arrests of domestic political figures coincided with sensitive diplomatic talks between Iran and the United States. Hard-liners may have worried that a deal would change the balance of factional forces inside the regime, and so sought to shore up their internal position by arresting their rivals. Mahmoud Sadeghi, a reformist former member of Parliament, went so far as to call the arrests a “pseudo-coup” in a post on X.

Surely Iran’s domestic and exiled opposition would rather participate in shaping the country’s fate than have it decided between the regime, with its many factions, and Iran’s foreign adversaries. But if the opposition is to play any role, it will have to get its act together and unite.</div>

            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-02-20</strong></p>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem has faced intense scrutiny from Republicans and calls for her firing from Democrats since the January 24 shooting of Alex Pretti by Customs and Border Patrol agents in Minneapolis. Now Noem’s tenuous standing with the Trump White House is creating concern in her home state of South Dakota that she might leave the Cabinet to challenge Senator Mike Rounds in the state’s June Republican primary.

Political allies of Rounds have begun preparing for this scenario, even though they remain skeptical that Noem will actually make the move, three people familiar with the discussions told me. To get into the race, Noem would have to register for the primary and collect the 2,171 supportive signatures statewide by the end of next month. A Noem adviser told me today that she has no plans to leave. But Noem could have an incentive to seek elective office if Democrats remain on track to win back control of the House and launch investigations into her tenure at the Department of Homeland Security. A Senate seat would give her both a professional staff and a fundraising platform to help defend herself.

“It’s something people are talking about across the state,” one Republican involved in South Dakota’s politics told me; this person, like others I spoke with, requested anonymity to discuss the rumors. “And based on everything I’ve been hearing, Mike Rounds would handily win that race.”

In recent weeks, Noem has ceded some of her public-leadership role overseeing immigration-enforcement operations, and President Trump has relied more on the White House “border czar” Tom Homan to lead those efforts. White House officials have grown frustrated with her performance as Republican midterm strategists raise alarms about the political damage her deportation strategy is doing to the party’s chances. One person familiar with the discussions told me that Noem’s position in the Cabinet is no longer secure, even though the president has not yet moved against her and has repeatedly praised her in public comments.

Read: Battles are raging inside the Department of Homeland Security

The situation has been complicated by the refusal of congressional Democrats to vote for a new budget for Noem’s department, which has caused a partial government shutdown that is expected to last at least into next week. Republicans say that Democratic calls for Noem’s removal make Trump pushing her out in the immediate future less likely. In his second term, Trump has been deeply reluctant to allow political pressure to force him into firing Cabinet members.

Several weeks ago, before the Pretti shooting, Republicans in South Dakota learned that pollsters were asking voters whom they would prefer in a matchup between Rounds and Noem, two people familiar with the calls told me, adding that they don’t know who is paying for the polling and have not seen the results.

The possibility of Noem running against Rounds has also prompted discussion among advisers to the president about possibly waiting to make a change to DHS leadership until after next month’s filing deadline, according to one person familiar with the discussions. Others have been supportive of a move. “Mike Rounds is so unpopular amongst Republican primary voters, he’d lose to a dead dog,” a national Republican strategist told me. The senator’s allies pushed back against that characterization. Rounds, 71, has successfully run statewide as a Republican four times since 2014, serving two terms as governor before being elected twice to the Senate.

Tricia McLaughlin, a spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security, told me in a text message that it would not be appropriate for a government spokesperson to comment on a story about Noem’s political future. Another adviser to Noem told me that her team had not polled the race.

Rounds’s Senate office did not respond to a request for comment. The White House spokesperson Davis Ingle told me in a statement, “President Trump has assembled the most talented and America First cabinet and staff in history,” before listing off some of the administration’s accomplishments.

Rounds and Noem, both former governors of South Dakota, have never been particularly close and have occasionally clashed in public. After Noem published a book that describes her decision to kill her family dog after she determined that it was dangerous and untrainable, Rounds was notably outspoken in his criticism. “I don’t see how it helps,” he said of her description of the incident. “These dogs become a member of a family, you know. People identify with that.”

Trump and Rounds have also clashed, particularly over Joe Biden’s victory in the 2020 election, which Rounds described as “fair”; Trump incorrectly maintains that he won the election. But Trump endorsed Rounds over the summer—“HE WILL NEVER LET YOU DOWN!” the president posted on social media. Senate Majority Leader John Thune, the senior senator from South Dakota, is a close ally of Rounds and would likely back him over Noem.

Another possible route for Noem is to run again for the U.S. House seat that she held from 2011 to 2019. That seat will be vacated next year by Representative Dusty Johnson, who has announced that he is running for governor. Noem has also expressed interest in the past about being selected as a running mate on a Republican ticket or mounting her own presidential campaign.</div>

            <h2>The DOJ Isn’t Built for This</h2>

For several hours last week, Attorney General Pam Bondi sat before the House Judiciary Committee with one apparent mission: Don’t back down.

The oversight hearing focused on the recent actions of the Justice Department, which has been consumed with the release of the Epstein files, as well as ongoing investigations into the fatal shootings of two American citizens by federal agents in Minneapolis. At some points, the back-and-forth between Bondi and Congress devolved into a screaming match. Faced with questions about her department’s haphazard redaction of the files, she often went on the attack, calling Representative Jamie Raskin a “loser lawyer” and asking Representative Jerry Nadler whether he’d “apologized to President Trump” for participating in his impeachment hearings.

Bondi seemed more passionate about these deflections than she did about defending the department’s work, which has been hampered in recent months by understaffing and low morale. DOJ reportedly lost nearly 10,000 employees from November 2024 to November 2025. U.S. Attorney’s Offices (which are part of the department) shed 14 percent of their workforce, a one-year reduction that officials say is unlike anything they’ve seen in years. Some were fired, some took a buyout package, and others simply walked away. Last month, Bondi suggested in court filings that the department was struggling to keep up with its workload, having released only a fraction of the millions of Jeffrey Epstein–related files under review. Some attorneys were reportedly spending all or most of their days on the files. (Bondi said on Saturday that “all” of the files have been released, as mandated by the Epstein Files Transparency Act, but lawmakers have criticized the files’ heavy redactions.)

Add to that a backlog of federal immigration cases and the ongoing legal fallout from the administration’s mass-deportation push, and the result is an organization that is thoroughly overwhelmed. The U.S. attorney for Minnesota, who has been responsible for defending recent federal immigration-enforcement efforts, described the new influx of casework as an “enormous burden.” One ICE attorney who volunteered to work on Minnesota’s backlog was reportedly removed from her DOJ post after telling a judge that her job “sucks” because of the increased caseload and the administration’s failure to comply with immigration court orders. “I wish you would just hold me in contempt, your honor, so that I can have a full 24 hours of sleep. I work days and night,” she said.

Nationally, DOJ is making some progress—the Executive Office for Immigration Review announced in September that it had whittled its pending-case backlog down from more than 4.18 million to under 3.75 million—but the lack of staffing will only make it harder to tackle the remaining caseload. (A DOJ spokesperson told me in a statement that “after four years of bureaucratic weaponization under the Biden Administration, President Trump and Attorney General Bondi have created the most efficient Department of Justice in American history.”)

The mission and purpose of the department has also been overhauled—many of its core functions have been politicized since Trump’s return to office. The president has directed the department to pursue his personal enemies and has replaced career DOJ employees with inexperienced MAGA loyalists, sometimes to the detriment of his own agenda. Take the recent prosecution of two longtime Trump rivals, New York State Attorney General Letitia James and former FBI Director James Comey. In September, after an acting U.S. attorney reportedly decided that the case against Comey was too weak to pursue, the president pressured him to resign and replaced him with one of his former lawyers, Lindsey Halligan, who had never prosecuted a case before. Halligan appeared to make several fundamental errors in presenting Comey’s case, and her cases against James and Comey have since been thrown out. She resigned in January, a few months after a judge ruled that she had been illegally appointed.

The New York Times reported that Bondi’s former chief of staff put out an open call on social media for lawyers who “support President Trump and anti-crime agenda” to privately message him about jobs within the department. These were, until recently, some of the most prestigious positions in the American legal system—the “crème de la crème,” my colleague Quinta Jurecic, who covers politics and law, told me. Now the halls are empty enough that a department affiliate is seeking out applicants online.

At least the remaining employees know who’s in charge. This afternoon, a banner was hung on the DOJ building’s facade—on it, right above the slogan “Make America Safe Again,” was a picture of the president.

Here are three new stories from The Atlantic:

The quest to live forever has fascinated humans for millennia. The Epic of Gilgamesh, composed about 4,000 years ago, follows a king who searches the world for a plant that can restore youth, only to lose the plant to a thieving snake. The (likely apocryphal) story of Juan Ponce de León, who is said to have embarked on a search for the Fountain of Youth in the early 16th century, refuses to die—unlike its protagonist, who was killed along his journey.

Today’s longevity-medicine movement is driven by the same aggressive desire for eternal youth as the mythic stories of old. But whereas in earlier times ideas about wellness could travel only as fast as the people who held them, today just about anyone with an internet connection can use social media and AI-generated graphics to sell medical advice in seconds. Despite a decided shortage of placebo-controlled trials in humans to support that advice, the business of longevity is booming, thanks in large part to sleek direct-to-consumer marketing delivered by health influencers with far more confidence than evidence. By 2030, $8 trillion might be spent annually on longevity-related products.

Read. A new book buries the Obama-era idea that small shifts in personal behavior can greatly improve the world, Rob Wolfe writes.

Watch. A breakthrough film is rarely nominated only for its screenplay. In 2022, David Sims picked some of the best films from previous years that were underappreciated by the Academy in this way.

            <h2>Let’s Talk About RFK Jr.’s Workout Pants</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-02-20</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/2026/02/rfk-jrs-workout-pants/686071/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">A post on X claimed to be a simple message from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services: Stay active; eat well. But the 90-second video it shared, called “Secretary Kennedy and Kid Rock’s Rock Out Work Out,” seems designed to be bewildering. Here was Robert F. Kennedy Jr. eating steak and doing preacher curls in his belted blue jeans and a pair of hiking shoes; and here he was again, stripping off his T-shirt to ride an exercise bike inside a sauna; and here he was a little later, strutting over to a cold-plunge tub (still in his blue jeans but with the belt removed); and here he went into the tub, sliding underwater in his dungarees.

Why was the HHS secretary bathing in a pair of pants? The video never provides an answer for this question, even as Kennedy plays pickleball, then mugs for the camera, then soaks in a Jacuzzi with a glass of milk, all while still in jeans. It’s just bizarre—a PSA that presumably has been dialed in by his staff to maximize its WTF effect. (The video has been viewed more than 13 million times and produced some 11,000 replies; HHS did not respond to a request for comment about the video or the jeans.) However his peculiar gymwear habit started, its present state is very clear: The secretary’s jeans are self-aware.

Kennedy’s proclivity for working out in belted denim long predates the knowing wink with which it’s now displayed. Take the summer’s “DOD-HHS Fitness Challenge,” for which Kennedy donned his favorite workout gear and did a bunch of pull-ups with Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth. Or the viral clip of him from 2023, wearing jeans and boots and nothing else, squeezing out a final set on Venice Beach. I don’t believe that these show a man who lifts in jeans to maximize his clicks. I believe that they show instead a man who fits a waning archetype in fitness culture, a species that has for decades been endemic to the gym: Kennedy is a jeans guy.

I’ve worked out, off and on, for more than 30 years—and for all of that time, the jeans guys have remained a steady presence on the rubber floors. They are sometimes taciturn, sometimes chatty. They often pair their jeans with boots, as Kennedy will do, and with a T-shirt or a tank top or a hoodie. But lest you think he simply has no truck with any gym-specific gear, the jeans guy is sometimes spotted wearing padded lifting gloves, or a leather lifting belt across his Levi’s. At times, his social role will overlap with that of other weight-room regulars, not least of which is the gym grandpa, who hangs around and shoots the breeze and doles out tips on how to lift. However he appears, and however much he gabs, the jeans guy’s social status is the same: He’s an outsider. Rarely does one find a jeans guy paired up with a workout partner. “It’s usually like, ‘The jeans guy rides alone,’” Tolga Ozyurtcu, a historian of physical culture at the University of Texas at Austin, told me when I called him up to talk about this phenomenon.

Not everyone enjoys the company of the jeans guy. Some see him as a threat. Planet Fitness once made a point of banning denim in the gym, along with grunting, dropping dumbbells, and judging others. (Those who broke these rules could be punished with a “lunk alarm” and summarily kicked out.) But this discrimination feels as ill-considered as it is unfair: In my experience, jeans guys are harmless at the very worst, and at best, they add some needed color to a dreary landscape. In this way, the jeans guys are akin to other gentle curiosities, such as the shorts guys who alight on college campuses in wintertime, and the black chipmunks that scamper by from time to time in city parks.

What motivates the jeans guy? No one knows. He is, if nothing else, as inscrutable as a four-leaf clover. Ask him why he isn’t wearing shorts, and he will likely tell you that he chooses denim for efficiency. When Fox News’s Jesse Watters asked Kennedy in August to explain his favored workout gear, all Watters got was this: “Well, I just started doing that a long time ago because I would go hiking in the morning and then I’d go straight to the gym, and I found it was convenient, and now I’m used to it.” In the hope of getting more, I reached out to Ryan Calder, the fitness coach who spotted Kennedy on the incline bench in that viral video from 2023. Did Calder—who at the time was dressed, quite reasonably, in shorts—happen to ask Kennedy about his denim pants and boots? He did. “I asked him right then, you know, like, ‘So, you’re banging it out in jeans?,’” he told me. “And he’s like, ‘Yeah, man, this is my efficient way. I only have 30 minutes. I don’t spend time changing clothes.”

A jeans guy’s self-report must be taken with a grain of salt—maybe even he cannot really fathom why he lives the way he does. Kennedy’s is no exception to this rule. In public appearances, he is almost always in a suit and skinny tie, so adding a daily interlude in workout denim would hardly seem to be a way of saving time. His habit may be instead a product of the workout culture he imbibed during his youth. “The jeans guy, it’s a thing. It’s a very definitive thing,” Conor Heffernan, a fitness historian at Ulster University, told me. “It’s a trope we’ve had since the ’80s.” The power lifters of the time, some of whom were connected to the biker subculture, adopted a “rugged, spit-and-sawdust aesthetic” in the gym, he said. This included denim. During the same period, glitzy photoshoots for bodybuilders also featured jeans, to match the styles of the time. Heffernan brought up a famous photo of Lee Haney, the eight-time Mr. Olympia, flexing shirtless in a pair of jeans above a steamy manhole cover in New York City. Perhaps the older jeans guys of today—Kennedy himself is 72—are nothing less than living fossils.

Their aesthetic may have faded out, but a younger set of jeans guys—ironic jeans guys—has since emerged in the fitness culture. Take the influencer-marathoner Truett Hanes: His brand is built on running very fast and very far … in jeans. He claims that this started as a goof, but it has turned into a business. He now represents a denim company, as well as a chafing cream. The idea of working out in jeans, partly silly and partly serious, is everywhere once you start to look for it. One gymwear brand, Raskol, launched a line of lifter jeggings in 2023 in shades such as “blue steele” and “pale thunder,” with a tongue-in-cheek campaign that had bodybuilders boasting of their pride at using PEDs—that is, “performance-enhancing denims.”

This self-mocking move may be just the prelude to a fuller jeans-guy renaissance, Heffernan suggested. After all, Raskol’s jeggings did sell out, he said. And this wouldn’t be the first time that a traditional signifier of masculinity crept back into mainstream culture by way of performative half jokes. The fashion for bushy beards, and beards’ association with authentic manliness, has followed this same trajectory from irony to earnestness during its various resurgences since the early 19th century. Now the same could be happening to denim workout pants: Today’s goof evolves into tomorrow’s masculine ideal. “I think irony moves into fashion very quickly in fitness,” Heffernan said.

For Kennedy, this process may appear to be going in reverse: His latest workout video shows that he’s in on the joke, that in 2026 he’s capable of pumping irony as well as iron, and that he can engage in what Heffernan described as “a very deliberate deployment of jeans.” But it also shows that there is a recipe, if not a cultural machinery, for rehabilitating out-of-date ideas. Not all of Kennedy’s eccentricities are as quaint as how he dresses in the gym, and there are many ways of going backwards in pursuit of health while pretending that you’ve found a way into the future. MAHA is nostalgia, sometimes with a smirk. The jeans guy dunks himself in water. The jeans guy is reborn.</div>

ChatGPT and food-delivery droids came to my campus at roughly the same time, in the 2022–23 academic year. My response—cranky, tweedy—was hopelessly on brand for a history professor. The chatbot and the droid appeared to be in league, robotic species on the vanguard of civilizational collapse. Both were premised on the idea of frictionless ease, liberating their users from outmoded toils. Because you couldn’t kick the chatbot, I had to resist the urge to kick the droids. I felt new and sudden sympathy with those English weavers who tried to smash the machines.

I’d like to think that my grievance was rooted in something beyond my own impending irrelevance. The product of too many years of humanities education, I wanted to defend the foundational exercise of writing. Going back to the late 19th century, writing instruction in the humanities has been premised on the idea of writing as both a craft and an art: a practical skill that could be taught and refined, and a creative practice through which sustained effort yielded insight. The formula went something like this: We read things, we had conversations about them to unravel their many levels, then we went and wrote. In that final part of the cycle—the writing part—were torments, perhaps even tortures, but good things happened. We became thinking people, mingling with complex ideas and perhaps coming up with some of our own. The advent of the chatbot raised an unsettling question: What if writing didn’t have to be hard? What if that noble ordeal was no more necessary than going to a well to fetch your water when you could just turn on a tap?

Combing through the archives of The Atlantic, one might reasonably conclude that both writing instruction and civilization have been in peril since roughly 1890. In 1893, James Jay Greenough argued that young minds had become impoverished by too many slang words to form anything but “narrow” ideas. By November of 1959, when the magazine had a special section on “The Teaching of Reading and Writing,” excessive emphasis on standardized testing had pushed writing instruction to the side—just at the moment when young people’s minds were becoming addled by modern media and the popularity of “illiterate expressions.”

Easy as it is to mock the melodrama of such pronouncements, I can understand them. Underlying the different diagnoses and prescriptions is the basic idea that animated my own efforts as a professor: that learning to write was vital to the formation of a mind. As Henry Chauncey put it in the magazine in 1959, the “art of written communication” was “clear thinking clearly expressed.” Something essential was happening in the hard work of trying to make your thoughts comprehensible to another human being (even if that human being was just your teacher). The sparks thrown off in the process could become the energy for better thoughts—for more complex and perhaps even original ideas.

The trouble was that thinking the thoughts, finding the words, and getting them down on the page could involve considerable discomfort. Writing in the magazine in 1912, soon after graduating from college, Randolph Bourne described the “hopeless labor of writing.” “One must struggle constantly,” Bourne lamented, “to warm again the thoughts that are cold or have been utterly consumed.”

Students didn’t turn to chatbots to warm their cold and consumed thoughts all at once, but the advent of AI tools sparked a disorienting reckoning for those of us reading their papers. At first, some of the work coming in was just a little weird. Certain papers appeared as Frankenstein monsters of machine-made and human text, some of it eloquent yet empty, some of it strained  and meandering in familiar ways.

But in the years to come, with updated models and the fuller integration of AI into people’s lives, I noticed a general smoothing out of student writing. The hard edges and rough parts were getting sanded down, and the arguments and ideas were more uniform. It was less common to see the kinds of errors I’d hoped to preempt on the guide to writing and history I gave the students. They didn’t refer to works of historical scholarship as “novels” much anymore, but they also didn’t find their way into some beautiful, odd idea in a convoluted sentence buried in the second paragraph on page 4.

By the end of last year, I had dusted off blue books for the first time in years and had the students sit for an in-class essay. Reading their tortured handwriting was a small price to pay to see their thoughts anew—messy, but alive.</div>

If you put any stock in the ability of IQ tests to assess intelligence, we humans have spent the past century steadily getting smarter. (And if you don’t put any stock in them, well, we humans have steadily gotten better at IQ tests.)

Because IQ is a standardized measure, humankind’s average score still sits at 100—but this isn’t your granddaddy’s 100. IQ tests are regularly recalibrated, and over the past many decades, when new subjects have taken an old test, they have almost always outscored their predecessors’ average; Grandpa’s generation might have hovered around 100, but the kids are scoring 115 … which then becomes the new 100.

This phenomenon is called the Flynn effect, and researchers still aren’t sure what causes it. Perhaps it’s due to more efficient education or better nutrition. The reason could be that modern environments contain more interesting stimuli or that modern gasoline no longer contains lead.

I haven’t seen anyone propose that trivia is to thank, but the growing popularity of quizzing tracks with the IQ trend line pretty well too. I think I speak for all of science when I say we shouldn’t rule it out quite yet.

And by the way, did you know that barcode scanning was initially greeted with a huge backlash? The first item ever scanned by barcode was a pack of Wrigley’s chewing gum at a supermarket in Troy, Ohio, in June 1974, but by the end of the ’70s, only about 1 percent of stores had adopted barcodes.

Consumers were worried that the tech would be used to rip them off. Advocacy groups mounted campaigns against the barcode, and protesters even picketed stores that used scanners. Others swore that the barcode was the biblical “mark of the beast.”

Obviously, it eventually caught on, and people got over their fears—though if you ever get rung up at $6.66, maybe offer to round to the next dollar, just in case.

How did you do? Come back tomorrow for more questions, and if you think up a great question after reading an Atlantic story—or simply want to share a fact—send it my way at [email protected].

And by the way, did you know that the University of Bologna is nearly a millennium old? It’s the world’s oldest university that was founded as such (at least one older university started as a madrasa), and its alumni include Copernicus, Dante, and more than one pope.

Imagine trying to write a halfway-decent poem for an assignment, and your classmate turns in the Divine Comedy. Then again, at least you’d have had a leg up on Copernicus, who probably got marked off plenty for insisting that the Earth actually orbits the sun.</div>

classism breeds corruption which produces incompetency

At least they identified the decision-making problems before another Challenger incident.  When the prevailing attitude is &quot;it looks good on paper.  What could go wrong?&quot; without real-world testing of the hardware in actual space environments, they are signalling they are willing to accept mistakes and fix them later.

Not the way manned missions should be tested.  Accept the cost of many test flights in actual space with proposed modifications before putting astronauts on board.

At least they identified the decision-making problems before another Challenger incident.
As they said, &quot;shortcomings that nearly left astronauts unable to safely return&quot;, it would probably be more akin to Columbia than Challenger.  Just sayin&#39; ...

I wonder how much of this is due to funding problems. They are under pressure to get Americans on the moon before China lands people there around 2030, but to accelerate the programme and do it safely requires money.

>> a culture incompatible with human spaceflight.

Yep. Boing has already unlocked that achievement for normal planes, now they are trying hard in the spaceflight.

It&#39;s called &quot;Boeing&quot; for a reason.That&#39;s the sound generated at the exact moment the plane touches the ground.

&quot;Starliner has design and engineering deficiencies that must be corrected, but the most troubling failure revealed by this investigation is not hardware,&quot; Isaacman wrote in his letter to the NASA workforce. &quot;It is decision-making and leadership that, if left unchecked, could create a culture incompatible with human spaceflight.&quot;No shit. It took an outsider to point out to the Artemis program that not a single one of them had ever read &quot;SP-287 What Made Apollo a Success?&quot; and so effectively used none of the knowledge and experience built up over the decade-plus of the Apollo program.

A helium leak was reported prior to launch, yet they proceeded with the mission because it was “minor”. Then, it became a major issue and they were forced to scrap the mission. Do I have it right?

The old NASA made occasional mistakes, but they had a culture of must-not-fail; each team had to prove their subsystem was nominal before the mission could proceed. Their dedication was legendary.

Politicization, DEI, and the general decline in American technical standards and work ethic have ruined Boei

Show us on a picture of NASA where DEI touched you

We all knew that the moment that they said it would take months, rather than days, for the astronauts to return.

Boeing space flight is an absurdly expensive display of incompetence. Artemis should have been scrapped years ago.

            <div id="article-text">I think Obama is trolling the Pedophile in Chief.  Later Obama can state &quot;It doesn&#39;t take much to get the Trump hooked on the latest conspiracy theory.  I mentioned aliens to see if he would take the bait and he did.  Cognitive decline affects us all.&quot;

This guy doesn&#39;t understand why child rape bothers us. Someone should check his hard disk.

There are probably many illegal aliens in the Epstein Files, but the criminals are the oligarchs.

His clarification is basically that the universe is too big for there not to be other lifeforms out there.

Waiting for the dictator to die out is often a long and windy road. Better act now. Vote.

Isn&#39;t that what the Epstein files were all about? Beings so rich and powerful they don&#39;t exhibit typical human behaviors. I&#39;m sure there was probing involved.

A religion takes a collection of sacred writings as its inerrant source of facts. Science doesn&#39;t do that.

Science takes observations as facts, and builds testable, falsifiable models, theories, or laws from them. Whether a model, theory, or law survives depends on whether it can make accurate predictions or explanations of other observations. If it can&#39;t, then it is discarded. No faith or belief involved.

Now, scientists do form hunches and opinions, including on whether extraterrestrial life exists. They may engage in arguments about what contitutes possible evidence for it, and debate how and where such life could be found. But scientists are hard to convince, especially about something as extraordinary as the detection of extraterrestrial life. What would it take to convince them? As Carl Sagan said, &quot;Extraordinary claims demand extraordianry evidence.&quot; Scientists would temper their conviction of something by the strength or weakness of the evidence. They wouldn&#39;t just take something on &quot;faith.&quot;

That said, there are many scientists who are religious. But they don&#39;t apply religious thinking when they&#39;re in their labs. They save that for their churches, temples, synagogues, mosques, and so on. They can keep those two parts of their lives separated.

And I give psychology a break here. Statistical variance in their data is typically much larger than in the physical sciences. The work psychologists do is worth doing, even though they cannot arrive at conclusions that are as precise. But they are still governed by evidence, just like other scientists.

&quot;Overall evolution is running out of explanation for the ever larger facts that are challenging its claims. The most obvious of these are the irreducible complexity of many biological mechanisms that make their spontaneous emergence an unreasonably unlikely event; a lot of the time the evolutionist position comes down to: &#39;of course it must have been evolution because I refuse to consider the alternative&#39;. THAT is a faith statement ;)&quot;

Ah, yet another variation on: gee, everything is sooooo complex, I don&#39;t understand it, therefore God. Grow up, grasshopper. There is no credible alternative to &quot;evolution&quot;. God is not a credible alternative. Ever see him? Has he ever said squat to you? Can we test him for observations? No, no, and no.

&quot;the irreducible complexity of many biological mechanisms that make their spontaneous emergence an unreasonably unlikely event;&quot;

The irreducible complexity argument is right out of Intelligent Design, i.e., create a strawman and then declare him real. &quot;spontaneous emergence&quot;, yep, and you understand nothing about evolution if that is what you think. &quot;unreasonably unlikely event&quot;, Oh? So it is unfathomable to you so it must not have happened?

Try this, go to your bank and demand money because you cannot understand why they just don&#39;t just hand you a bag of it.

&quot;The most obvious of these are the irreducible complexity...&quot;You&#39;re running out of places to hide.

We know scientists should know better.  That’s what makes this worse.  We should have not allowed the infection of the religion of politics to infect science.

While that&#39;s how it is supposed to work, you do have to be careful with people abusing science for their own ends.

The classic example is scientific racism. It started centuries ago, as a way to justify slavery by &quot;scientifically&quot; proving that white people were superior and black people were simply meant to be dominated and controlled. More recently we have had things like The Bell Curve, which was arguing that some races are more intelligent than others, based on obviously flawed but &quot;scientific&quot; methodolog

&quot;No faith or belief involved.&quot;Science is a process practiced by humans, belief is definitely involved.  Humans are flawed, if they weren&#39;t &quot;science&quot; wouldn&#39;t exist in the vocabulary, everything would conform to scientific ideals. Science itself is predicated on &quot;belief&quot; being involved and science benefits from it while compensating for its weakness. You cannot separate the process from those doing it.

&quot;Now, scientists do form hunches and opinions,...&quot;Right, because belief is involved.

&quot;...but this wouldn&#39;t pass as scientific evidence for the existence of extraterrestrial life under any other lens.&quot;It would pass as evidence of &quot;possible existence&quot; though.  That&#39;s more than religion has.  And faith doesn&#39;t have &quot;positions&quot;, faith is feeling; faith isn&#39;t defined by a &quot;lack of sufficient evidence&quot;, it is defined as belief outside of consideration of evidence.  There can be both faith and evidence, it&#39;s only in religious contexts where that&#39;s consistently not true.

With the arrest of ex-Prince Andrew, Trump is getting even more nervous and trying to deflect attention from the Epstein files.

Sadly I doubt that the Andrew thing will go very far. He might get a slap on the wrist. They are only looking at if he gave Epstein sensitive information as part of his job as ambassador. While it seems likely that he gave out the information in exchange for access to girls to rape, or because Epstein was blackmailing him, the chances of anything that harms Trump coming out of this are low.

&quot;Quick! Look! Aliens are real and Obama broke the law for saying so! Just stop looking at the Epstein files!&quot; - The US Pedophile in Chief

The theory is that he&#39;s willing to protect the democrats in the files if it helps him and his cronies in getting away too.But the very obviously selecting redacting of the files still speaks volumes about how the government is trying to shift the focus to anyone but their friends.Like how Bill Barr, who closed the Epstein &quot;suicide&quot; investigation within days, is starting to pop up in documents at an alarming rate... For every democrat-aligned person in there, there&#39;s a dozen Repubs.

Just release it all. Nail everyone who&#39;s implicated in wrongdoing. Stop trying to distract from what is a way bigger scandal than Watergate.

and is the REAL JFK killer in the files as well?

Why do I never have mod points when I REALLY need them!?

Whether it be the Epstein files, JFK, or aliens, very little of the news we hear these days is actually about governing the country.

Will they send SPICE (Space ICE) after them?

Whatever you suspect his motives to be at any given time... yeah. That&#39;s exactly what they are. Want to take the heat off one conspiracy? Throw the red meat of another to those same wolves. There&#39;s no subtlety or nuance to the mechanism. No deft sleight of hand or misdirection. Like his &quot; I know you are but what am I?&quot; approach, or the reliable way he accuses others of doing exactly what he is guilty of, the man&#39;s actions and defenses come straight out of the schoolyard.

It&#39;s actually one of his more endearing qualities - a kind of backhanded honesty in a way.

I won&#39;t bother listing the books, because most people here and elsewhere have already made up their own minds.

I offered to bet on the issue, but nobody has the balls to back up their lack of convictions.

Countless airforce pilots are among the many who&#39;ve witnessed UFOs, and sometimes seen bodies.

Ok, I&#39;ll wait for the usual comments dismissing me as ... let me see ... a ... conspiracy theorist.

I don&#39;t mind. Next year is the most likely for Open Contact to be announced. We&#39;ll see.

The key letter in UFO is U. Whoever saw it or took a picture of it etc cannot identify it and doesn&#39;t know what it is.That&#39;s also why you only see blurry photos, because if the photo was clear it wouldn&#39;t be an unidentified object anymore - you would know what it was, it would be something benign and the case would be closed.

No UNDISPUTABLE AND DEFINITIVE PROOF of intelligent alien life will emerge in the next 12 months.

If aliens do land on earth, ICE will capture them and place them in containment. They will learn Spanish. They will hate Trump. Shit, this could be a Netflix movie. Never mind.

Try District 9 (2009).  It uses aliens instead of people as an allegory for South African apartheid.

For something American but a bit older, you can look at Alien Nation (1988) or the television series that followed.

It was Trump&#39;s pal Tony Blair who once said: populists don&#39;t, on the whole, invent grievances. They exploit them.

Don&#39;t think about that. Look at this. Aliens!

in a free and open society. That we have governments and corporations that cannot tell the truth tells us they are completely unethical. If they were doing good, they&#39;d be showing off but since they&#39;re ashamed, they hide their actions. This is exactly what classism and crime looks likes

Chicks are people too! but call them ladies because some of them don&#39;t like &quot;chick&quot;, &quot;dame&quot; or &quot;broad&quot;.  Or anything else dudes call them.

Because the gutted program effectively worked for freedom of speech by building technologies that enable censorship evasion in each country. The new program will only provide access to contents through the censorship filter of the US administration.

Not really an &quot;alternative&quot;. The previous program was about helping people break out of oppressive government controlled networks. This is about funneling everyone through the US (oppressive?) network.

Seriously I don&#39;t think people fully grasp this year Insanity of us threatening to invade Greenland just to seize land like some bunch of bandit Kings.I think most people just took it as the ramblings of a senile old man, not someone who was sincerely ready to mobilize forces to invade a sovereign foreign land.

This got going on threats and planning on banning X for AI childporn fakes by UK and others. Musk is probably involved.

Then you have all that neo-nazi stuff that gets banned and Musk was upset at Germany curtailing that...

You really think things will go back to normal in three years, don&#39;t you?  You really are unable to see the damage that has been inflicted on your nation, much of which will never be repaired. Particularly the damage to the constitution. The last year was a reminder to us all that the constitution is just a piece of paper; it has no power to save us except as people in power (and indeed all people) voluntarily honor it.  The DOJ is actively working to circumvent the limits of the constitution and in fact is currently in literal violation of the law, yet courts are powerless to do anything other than pass rulings (by design), and congress also sits idle and does nothing to check the executive.  The system only worked before because people, especially presidents, agreed to abide by it.  Not anymore.  Don&#39;t think for a moment this isn&#39;t doing permanent damage to the Republic.  I thought the Star Wars prequels were pretty bad (and they are), but Lucas&#39; story of the fall of the republic and the rise of the empire have real parallels in what we see happening today.  Trump may be a rambling old man, but he&#39;s surrounded by people who aren&#39;t rambling and aren&#39;t senile, who very much want all of what he has said he wants, including &quot;having Greenland.&quot;  That&#39;s why we take it seriously.

Multilateral agreements, be they about peace or trade, are dead, even if a sane guy gets in the white house in a few years.  No one wants to take the risk of signing something with the US only to have it be torn up when the next crazy guy gets elected.  Free trade and globalization is dead.  There will be no new north American free trade agreement. No one in the administration wants it, and congress doesn&#39;t want it either.  By all accounts the president wants everyone to self destruct, sowing division,  and then he&#39;ll come in and steal what&#39;s left for himself.  That&#39;s the way he ran his businesses, and that&#39;s the way he runs the country.

There are no winners.  Things have been fracturing for decades, but Trump finally threw the brick that shattered it.  Whether it was inevitable or not, you&#39;ll forgive us if we aren&#39;t exactly thrilled about him ripping it all down.

The movement to switch to European, or at least non-US technology, is gaining momentum here. People aren&#39;t going to switch back in 3 years.

There are some gaps, but those are opportunities.

What&#39;s to stop the powers that be over in those European countries from just adding freedom.gov to the blacklist and calling it a day?  This would be as silly as me trying to launch a VPN service that lets you bypass Florida&#39;s porn age verification requirements, from inside Florida.  I realize it&#39;s not a 1:1 analogy, I&#39;m just saying that you can&#39;t successfully fight something you disagree with when you&#39;re clearly at a disadvantaged position to mount your attack.

&quot;It&#39;s over Anakin, I have the high ground!&quot;

Yes, you are missing something rather obvious.

Literally nobody in Europe will even for a moment think that a xxx.GOV domain hosts anything but stupid trumpistani propaganda, and the thing will be just as popular as the &quot;melania&quot; movie, which isn&#39;t tracking even on pornolab.

There&#39;s more than enough crap you can read in our native European in all those national and .eu domains as it is.

What can &quot;occur&quot; in the head of an imbecile without an education whose life achievement is raping young girls procured for him by a russian/israeli spy?

Actually no you give Europe too much credit. There is a world of nutjobs over here too. Heck even in politics there are friends of Trump, and yes they do get an ever increasing number of votes. We have people who follow MAGA&#39;s agenda, we have people on Truth social, we have our anti-vaxxers, our racists, our Putin simps, etc.

The thing is virtually 100% of these people already know how to use a VPN to do the thing the USA is proposing to help them do. This is a pointless product in an over saturated market.

Well I would expect irs.gov to provide reasonably accurate information about US tax law. Obviously they, like all tax agencies, are not going to give me information about obscure legal tax loopholes etc, but I would expect them to get the basics right.

A portal made with the single purpose of circumventing EU laws? Of course it will be blocked EU wide in 3, 2, 1...

Great job, guys, fight censorship abroad while allowing states to censor the crap out of 3D printing and any vaguely related piece of software that interacts with it.I&#39;m no 3D printer expert (don&#39;t have space for one and really don&#39;t have the patience to design things in CAD, so I never got into it), but it seems to me that the cost of a printer capable of printing the receiver portion of a gun + the costs of remainder of the necessary gun parts, exceeds that of just buying a basic inexpensive pistol.  [academy.com] I totally get that some people like to mess around with this stuff as a hobby or for mah freedums!!1, but if the end result is just to get a firearm and you&#39;re not legally

I&#39;m not sure what kind of ecosystem they imagine exists that would prevent repraps from running offline. At this stage I would be completely unsurprised if they didn&#39;t know how to determine how many reprap repo forks there are.

They really imagine a level of consumer level turnkey convenience that just isn&#39;t there, even in expensive kit.

How does this get around the validation of certificates on https sites?

Every way this can work will require this website to be able to spy on every page you view through it.

Do you think it&#39;s more likely that nobody on staff has heard of a VPN, or that they&#39;re too scared to explain how much this isn&#39;t a bargaining chip? It&#39;s sorta hard to tell.

I&#39;m just waiting for Trump to create his own VPN service. I hope the IP address originates from Epstein Island.

>One source said officials had discussed including a virtual private network function to make a user&#39;s traffic appear to originate in the U.S. and added that user activity on the site will not be tracked

They tracked actual congressmen looking at the Epstein files, only a fool would believe that this government run VPN is not going to track all user activity.

So what was all that crap about leaning on CBS to not Stephen Colbert interview James Talrico? How come you arranged to have Jimmy Kimmel jerked off the air before it became apparent how stupid the alleged administration looked? What&#39;s behind that budding Nazi, the sprog of Uncle Larry, attempting to snatch up WB so he can knacker CNN?

            <div id="article-text">Imagine going back in time and telling the founders that people would have to get permission from the government to make a gun.

Back in the modern world, there&#39;s nothing illegal in the US in making guns for personal use and many people do. This law is both idiotic and blatantly unconstitutional.

They would have been fine with it.  The second amendment guarantees states the right to form armed militias (or to put it in modern terms, armed police forces).  It wasn&#39;t intended to give every individual the right to own guns for their own private use.  That&#39;s a modern reinterpretation.

The Constitution reserves the right to arm militias to the US Congress (typically the states National Guards). If the state wants an armed militia of any other type (police force) the only way they can be armed is as citizens.

That&#39;s just completely false. Gun manufacturing is a highly regulated industry.While some states do have restrictions, you do not need any sort of federal license for manufacturing for personal use. The ATF&#39;s own website even confirms such: &quot;An individual may generally make a firearm for personal use.&quot;It&#39;s only &quot;heavily regulated&quot; when you&#39;re doing it as a business.

I don&#39;t understand why SoftwareArtist thinks it&#39;s ok to outright lie.

Manufacturing *for resale* is highly regulated.

Why is it your post is almost completely counterfactual from start to finish?

The second amendment guarantees states the right to form armed militias (or to put it in modern terms, armed police forces). This is thoroughly false.  &quot;[T]he right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed.&quot;  The prefatory clause about the militia explains the motivation but does not recognize or protect anything on its own.  &quot;The people&quot; have a First Amendment right to peaceably assemble; a Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms; a Fourth Amendment right to be secure in their persons, houses, papers and effects against unreasonable searches; and retain rights not granted to the federal government or reser

Generally it is not illegal for you to rent time in a machine shop (in the United States) to produce a receiver (depending on various state laws.)

It is also generally not illegal in the United States (again, depending on various state laws) to run your own small scale ammunition press at home to make your own ammo.  It is in fact, the only way for certain out-of production calibers to be produced these days, unless you want to commission a custom run.  There are also people who design and produce their own

You don&#39;t need any permits to manufacture and sell ammunition.

No idea that folks routinely mill their own lowers in machine shops, and have for decades?

You&#39;re on fire. And as usual, also dead wrong. You can privately manufacture firearms and easily register them through someone with an FFA in most states.

You can also privately load/reload ammo in most states too.

The same argument that anyone who knows how to work metal can make a gun ignored that 3D printers are different. If they were not, they wouldn&#39;t be so desirable. The whole point is to make it easier, trivial even, to make things.

Star Trek understood it, and it&#39;s been stated that the replicators won&#39;t make weapons. We aren&#39;t quite at the &quot;push a button, gun comes out&quot; phase, but there is a line somewhere.

I&#39;m not sure what the bill demands is even possible. Many vendors will just drop Ca like a hot potato, they&#39;re not that big compared to the rest of the world.

You can still build a practical 3D printer from an Arduino with a stepper control board. That&#39;s not going away, and that&#39;s not going to run the crazy theoretical magic gun parts detector.

The problem of ghost guns isn&#39;t so much 3D printing as it is CNC machining. No sane person is going to fire a fully 3D printed gun.

In this case, pretty sure theyâ(TM)re overstepping by so much that instead, *no one* will comply with the California standard, and California will just not have 3D printers.

California is too big of a market. Everyone will just conform to the California standard.The California standard is completely and utterly infeasible.  It fails Goodhart&#39;s law, which states that as soon as a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure.As soon as you say &quot;A part that looks like this arbitrary gun part cannot be manufactured&quot;, it&#39;s open season on designing a new version of the part that doesn&#39;t trip the rule.  And as soon as the government adapts to that new design, five minutes later, there&#39;s another new design that still doesn&#39;t trip the rule.It&#39;s a game of cat and

Anyway, my current plan is to figure out whether my assembly member voted for this trash, and if so, pledge the maximum dollar amount to the campaigns of every person running against that person in the next election.  If everyone reading this post did the same, these shit-for-brains-stupid laws wouldn&#39;t keep getting passed.And as I read this, I realize that the bill hasn&#39;t passed yet.  So consider this a pledge that if my assembly member does vote for it, I will support his or her opponents, without regard to their positions on any issues, simply because almost anyone would be better than someone clueless enough about technology to vote for a law like this.

Or download your OctaPrint firmware outside of the US. Or delete any silly reporting or AI nonsense that someone tries to add to the firmware you want to use.

What else should one expect from all these red states?

Today I learned that the states proposing these insane 3D printer bans, California, Washington, and New York - some of the most rabidly liberal states in the US - are, in fact, &quot;red states&quot;.

I mean, if you mean USSR red, then... yeah.

From your prescient assessment it would seem that the country formerly known as the USA has boiled down to just two shades of red, USSR-red and ruzzkie-pederation-red.

&quot;DOJ&quot; in this case refers to the California Department of Justice, not the US Federal Department of Justice.

Text of the proposed California Assembly bill is here:

How is this software going to know you&#39;re not repairing a water gun?

The receiver is whatever the ATF says it is.  In some cases, the frame is the receiver (for example a revolver, or a traditionally manufactured pistol).  In other cases, the metal rails that nest in the interchangeable plastic frame are the receiver.

A trigger is typically not considered part of the receiver.  However, there&#39;s nothing in the proposed law that says that the trigger shall be excluded from consideration as part of an overall algorithm to prevent printing of &quot;a firearm.&quot;

You continue to make things up. The &quot;issue&quot; (completely legal, and not in any way connected to reality) is which part is the serialzed component. This actually varies depending on the firearm.

You consistently seem so sure of yourself.

criminalize useing NON HP INK pass that bill now!!

Mass displacement of white collar workers underway.  A lot of careers outside of the white collar world require training and certification, with barriers to licensing (outside of exams) such as minimum number of hours worked before qualifying to sit for an exam.  Unemployment hasn&#39;t been adjusted to keep up with inflation.  Things are not great.

3D printers could be used to make unapproved machines at home.  Better tax people to create a bureaucracy dedicated to keeping people from potentially causing a non-existent public threat.  Best case - security theater.  Worst case - camel under the nose to start regulating computing devices as well.  After all, computers could be used to *gasp* share machine drawings for people to manufacture gun parts without a 3D printer!

Also, g-code is used not just for additive manufacturing, but also for things like routers and mills.  If you regulate all software capable of generating g-code for a 3D printer, you&#39;re also directly regulating all computing platforms used in those industries.  Open source project to generate g-code for a cricut?  Could be used as a circumvention device, BANNED.  Open source project to build a CNC mill requires a slicer - which now is illegal to run without a government subscription and yearly licensing fee in California.  Effectively BANNED.

Great, there goes the in-state manufacturing industry.  I guess we&#39;ll just have to ship all our work out of state, and those jobs too...

This really feels like rearranging deck chairs on the Titanic for the sake of &quot;doing something&quot;.  Invent a problem that doesn&#39;t exist, and then spend money making it go away.  Can we please start laying off politicians instead?  Or identifying the lobbyists that are pushing for this so we can rightly tar and feather them before this spreads any further?

BTW, folks from other states might not understand, this kind of insanity is standard in California (introduce invasive laws that make no sense) due to the fact that our legislature is FULL TIME.

Yes, we pay them (and their staffs) for 365 days of work (minus vacation and holidays).  And this is what they give us.

&quot;As of 2017, full-time legislatures generally had larger staffs than other legislatures. A few exceptions to this rule were Florida and Texas, whose hybrid legislatur

They do this instead of dealing with the homeless crisis, drug crisis, housing crisis, etc.

We can&#39;t get these jokers to do rent control or block foreign real estate speculation. So they keep trying to put GPS in our electric cars to tax us, or put vague requirements to control theoretically dangerous technology that is simply not a primary problem in this state right now.

Given that this is a new bill, it may not even make it out of committee.  Sadly, there are people who elect idiots who engage in performative legislation.  Whether that be anti-abortion legislation that was automatically unconstitutional until recently, or things like this.  There are people who don&#39;t think.  There are even worse attempts in history, like the move to legislatively define PI.I mean, most of us here recognize that trying to have 3D printers recognize &quot;gun parts&quot; is a bit like trying to have c

Homelessness is also a bad policy. Really messes with your economy when you have potential labor that isn&#39;t able to participate. And have retirees that suddenly get priced out of their homes due to their fixed income. And massive market collusion from landlord services. Frankly, I&#39;m not going to accept some hand waive &quot;economists&quot; say in order to accept that the current underregulated state is the best that things can get.

Yes, homelessness is a bad thing.  How is rent control supposed to eliminate it though?  It tends to result in LESS housing available, which is the problem.As for &quot;handwave&quot;, you mistake me considering it mostly off-topic, and thus summarizing, not that I was &quot;handwaving&quot; it.  Consider that I did mention that there are &quot;other ways&quot; to help keep rent prices and speculation under control.  That makes your &quot;current underregulated state&quot; missing the target, because I already said that the current state sucks -

1. &quot;The Public&quot; are idiots.2. How does &quot;being traceable&quot; somehow reduce crime? I seem to remember a study some years ago which found very few crime guns were traced because it either couldn&#39;t be done or there was no benefit to doing it.

&quot;Tracing&quot; is just another argument for registration, which is another word for confiscation.

Literally all objects (not just firearms, or even &quot;weapons&quot;, however you wish to define it) &quot;can be used in crime&quot;. Where do you get this stuff from?

&quot;tracability&quot; of a weapon to *solve a crime* is pure movie/TV nonsense.

You&#39;ve been watching too many tv shows with poorly lit (in dim blue light) high tech forensics labs featuring zoom/enhance.

Road to hell.  Check.Good intentions.  Check.

At this point I&#39;d want to know what the estimate is for establishing and funding the CA DOJ apparatus to regulate 3D printers in the state, and the impact it would case on professional and hobbyist markets through:

1.  Regulatory compliance.  There are a number of pistols that are not sold in California because California has its own set of safety certifications that manufacturers have to get that effectively act as a ban on sales in the state (hint, it&#39;s an effec

Sacramento wants to disarm every Californian. Would be a shame if a tyrant were to show up one of these days and steal elections, end our democratic processes, and overthrow 250 years of Constitutional government.

No no you&#39;re clearly mistaken. According to science, only right-coded policies can possibly have downsides and any left-coded policy is self-evidently an unalloyed good.

Just make 3D printed guns illegal. Put people in prison if they are found with one when they commit a crime. Oh wait. IT&#39;S ALREADY ILLEGAL. We already seize these guns by the thousands.

People have made hundreds of thousands of ghost guns in California before 3D printing was even viable. Both through the legal loop hole for 80% receivers and after that loophole was mostly plugged in California. It&#39;s too easy to do with shit you can get at harbor freight and a little practice and patience. And once one guy in the neighborhood gets the hang of it, he&#39;s inviting his buddies over to &quot;teach&quot; them how to do it as well. You end up with like 30-40 guns from one dude. With random serial numbers scrawled on them. (at least back when it was legal to make them here)

In California there might be 1500-2000 murders in a year, and in the same year the cops will seize around 10,000 guns without known manufacturer recorders. Some are guns with the serial numbers removed, many of them are home built in some capacity. Cops certainly don&#39;t like that there are so many armed people here, but the cops, the government, and the media like to scare us common people into thinking each of these guns is a killer. Yet the statistics show that these guns aren&#39;t really the causes for most of society&#39;s problems.

Should we not have so many unregistered firearms in the hands of people committing crimes? Obviously we shouldn&#39;t. But should we try to regulate into extinction something that is perhaps impossible to completely eliminate, while simultaneously ignoring a hundred other problems in society that we can address if we put our mind to it?

I&#39;m no gun nut, nor do I worship at the feet of the second amendment, but this seems downright stupid. I&#39;m betting this Bauer-Kahan person, although well intentioned, is probably not really well informed on this. I&#39;ll go do a little research.

I&#39;m living in a country with very strict gun control laws, and I think this is downright stupid.

The Lives of Others (2006) [imdb.com], about life in the Communist GDR (East Germany). There is a plot where one of the main characters is writes a news story the authorities don&#39;t approve of. They have many prominent authors identified by their preferred make/model of manual typewriter, so the fellow is smuggled a compact model from outside the republic so he can write without the government tracing the writing to him.

Unless the California state government plans to interfere with interstate commerce (which I believe is a violation of the constitution), this new measure wont matter at all, and I doubt they want to be affiliated with Cold War regimes.

I have just 3 points.I know I am getting old, but it seems like just last week there were no commercial 3D printers, they were all home built.  Then the hobby reached critical mass, and now there is a big market with lots of commercial models, and people making a living running giant print farms.  But it was still very recently that most printers were not commercial.  All that knowledge has not had time to go away, the firmware running these printers is still actively developed and freely available. So my first point is you don&#39;t need to buy a printer to own one.My second point is that machine components in isolation are very seldom indicative of the application of the whole assembly.  For some sort of AI agent to actually identify the real gun parts among the other non gun machine components would require the AI agent to have access to all the components printed on all the printers owned by an entity.  Basically it would require a massive database of everything you ever printed. Logistically difficult and legally contentious, but also there are people and companies prototyping devices which are company secrets on 3D printers.  They are not going to accept printers that give all their development designs to the government, and wow, talk about an industrial espionage target.And finally this whole discussion feels very much like a straw man to me.  3D printed guns just are not that good. You still have to have metal components to make a gun.  There is not a plastic printable on your general purpose 3D printer that can come close to making a chamber strong enough to hold the pressure of even wimpy rounds. .22lr has a SAAMI standard maximum chamber pressure of 24,000PSI.  It is also pretty warm.  Sure, I am sure you can print a chamber that will fire a round, but I would not shoot it, because you may have a better than 50% chance of the bullet going out the correct direction, but your chances are no where near high enough for me to put myself in harms way.So yeah, your theoretical fanatic assassin might be willing to use a plastic gun capable of firing a single round in its working life, but to make a functional reusable gun is going to require metal barrels, chambers, and bolts.  So the 3D printed gun as a real danger to society is a myth.Now a slam fire shotgun made with plumbing pipe with a nail welded in for a firing pin, those are actually functional and not hard to construct with a modicum of mechanical knowledge and tools.  Still not safe, but more reliable than anything 100% plastic.

Politicians display profound ignorance of technologyThey live in a fantasy world where they believe that laws can control everything

How are you going to detect anything but, say, a handful of well-known STLs?  And then draw attention to those by banning them?

How are you then going to stop people doing the inevitable thing:  Printing innocent-looking prints that can be broken down into useful parts for &quot;banned&quot; items?

People will literally take the latter as a challenge, and build weapons, etc. that use nothing more than standard replacement parts from other devices so you can say &quot;Oh, that&#39;s just an X part from

Last I heard, about a month and a half ago actually, it is COMPLETELY LEGAL in the USA* to make your own gun.  You just can&#39;t sell it, transfer it, and it has to be within Federal law in regards to barrel and overall length and a few other features. Oh, and it can&#39;t be an automatic unless you get a permit first.

(* last I heard CA was still part of the USA. did they secede while I was getting dinner or something?)

Not to mention anyone with more brain cells than the Cali politicians seem to have can walk into

The State Senate is 30 Democrats to 10 Republicans. The state Assembly is 60 Democrats to 20 Republicans. The standard definition of majority rule is anything over 1:1, and the definition of super-majority rule (where the majority can do anything and steamroller their opponents) is 2:1. This is a ratio of 3:1 and at this ratio the majority in CA does not even listen to the questions or opinions of their opponents. ANYBODY with that big of a majority will be corrupted and divorced from reality merely by thei

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Sign up for Executive Dysfunction, a weekly newsletter that surfaces under-the-radar stories about what Trump is doing to the law—and how the law is pushing back.

This week the Environmental Protection Agency took the momentous—and disastrous—step of repealing the government’s “endangerment finding” that greenhouse gases “harm public health or welfare,” which is a prerequisite for regulating these pollutants under the Clean Air Act. The text of the Clean Air Act and robust congressional debates at the time of its enactment bely EPA’s central justification for repealing the endangerment finding and the greenhouse gas emission standards for motor vehicles—that the Clean Air Act of 1970 was concerned only with local and regional pollutants. It wasn’t. But EPA’s repeal contains even more flaws. In particular, the agency relies on three key Supreme Court climate change cases to support its action but mischaracterizes each of them.

Most significantly, EPA mangles Massachusetts v. EPA, the 2007 case in which the Supreme Court decided that greenhouse gases are “air pollutants” for the purposes of the Clean Air Act. According to EPA, that case involved an interpretation of the statute’s general definition of “air pollutant” and was not a decision specific to the law’s section 202(a)(1), which governs the regulation of motor-vehicle emissions. Thus, EPA contends that “Massachusetts did not consider or have reason to interpret the scope of the EPA’s authority” under the portion of the Clean Air act releveant to vehicle emissions.

This proposition is flatly wrong. Indeed, in Massachusetts v. EPA, the Supreme Court granted certiorari to decide a specific question: “Whether the EPA Administrator has authority to regulate carbon dioxide and other air pollutants associated with climate change under section 202(a)(1).” In its opinion, the court reiterated this question: “The first question is whether §202(a)(1) of the Clean Air Act authorizes EPA to regulate greenhouse gas emissions from new motor vehicles in the event that it forms a ‘judgment’ that such emissions contribute to climate change.’” And in the next sentence the Supreme Court provided the answer: “We have little trouble concluding that it does.”

EPA would be wrong even in the absence of this explicit language in the opinion. Its revisionist reading of Massachusetts also conflicts with that bedrock principle that a case holding is the narrowest principle necessary to resolve the controversy. And that principle is that greenhouse gases are “air pollutants” that may be regulated under section 202(a)(1). EPA’s suggestion that the Supreme Court decided the broader question but not the narrower 202(a)(1) question turns basic legal reasoning on its head.

EPA’s mischaracterization of Supreme Court caselaw is not confined to Massachusetts v. EPA. The agency also provides a grievously misleading account of the 2014 Supreme Court opinion in Utility Air Regulatory Group v. EPA. That case has four key components. First, the Supreme Court held that EPA lacked the authority to regulate greenhouse gas emissions from certain stationary sources. Second, however, it also held that the agency had the authority to regulate the greenhouse gas emissions of other sources. Third, as a result of these two holdings, as Justice Antonin Scalia noted in announcing the court’s opinion, EPA could regulate the vast majority of the emissions—over 90 percent—that were at stake in the case. And, fourth, Justice Scalia’s majority opinion reaffirmed the holding in Massachusetts v. EPA, which it described as “’authoriz[ing] EPA to regulate greenhouse gas emissions from new motor vehicles’” if the agency “form[ed] a ‘judgment’ that such emissions contribute to climate change.’”

Yet, in its repeal of the endangerment finding, EPA repeatedly refers to the first component of this decision to cast doubt on its authority to regulate greenhouse gases. But the agency never mentions the remaining three components, which are significantly more important and which paint a very different picture.

Similarly, EPA misconstrues the core holding of West Virginia v. EPA, decided in 2022, which struck down certain EPA greenhouse gas emission standards for power plants. The problem that the court identified was that the regulation was premised on the requirement of a specified proportion of “generation shifting” from dirtier power sources to clean ones: from coal to natural gas and from coal and natural gas to renewables. The court held that EPA did not have the authority to require such generation shifting in Clean Air Act power-sector standards. But the court recognized that “there is an obvious difference between (1) issuing a rule that may end up causing an incidental loss of coal’s market share, and (2) simply announcing what the market share of coal, natural gas, wind, and solar must be, and then requiring plants to reduce operations or subsidize their competitors to get there.” The court viewed the first category as an uncontroversial consequence of standard environmental regulation—indeed, it is a ubiquitous consequence of practically all regulation. Only the second category is impermissible for power-sector standards.

In its regulation of the greenhouse gas emissions of vehicles, which started in the Obama administration, EPA has never required a specific market shift from internal combustion engine vehicles to electric vehicles. These regulations are therefore conceptually different from the one struck down in West Virginia v. EPA. Also, in EPA’s earlier vehicle regulations for greenhouse gases, the market shift that resulted from the regulation was minor and clearly “incidental,” since manufacturers primarily met the regulatory standard by making their internal combustion vehicles more efficient. And, even if a court were to find that the Biden administration’s later standards were impermissibly premised on large market shift toward EVs, the proper remedy would be to strike down those standards, not to eliminate EPA’s ability to put in place any greenhouse gas standards for motor vehicles, including ones that did not have this feature.

Lee Zeldin, the EPA Administrator, repeatedly says that his primary concern is with following the law. His characterization of the key Supreme Court cases on EPA’s authority to regulate greenhouse gases tells a very different story.

The term Orwellian is often trotted out as a cliché, but it suits the confluence of President Donald Trump’s two big actions today—holding the first meeting of his “Board of Peace” and finishing the mobilization of a massive military force on the flanks of Iran, ready to attack the Islamic Republic as soon as this weekend.

His Board of Peace, to which Trump said the U.S. would commit $10 billion (for what, it’s unclear), seems largely theatrical. The war in Gaza, which Trump claims to have ended, persists—Israel continues its demolitions, while Hamas is tightening its grip on the place and refusing to disarm—and the board’s larger goal of supplanting or overseeing the United Nations worldwide is fanciful, to say the least.

Meanwhile, the point of the armed buildup around Iran—the largest assembly of U.S. warplanes and warships in the region since the 2003 invasion of Iraq—is remarkably unclear. The U.S. armada mobilized to the region includes 18 warships (two of which are aircraft carriers) and many fighter jets, bombers, antimissile systems, and electronic jammers on nearby bases. This is enough to fight a weekslong battle, hitting targets related to any and all of those missions and disabling or intercepting most of the missiles that Iran might launch in response. But for what purpose—and with what chance of success, whatever the purpose might be—is another question.

Does Trump want to destroy Iran’s nuclear program, dismantle its ballistic missile sites, pull down the regime, or simply threaten a combination of all three to pressure the Iranians to make a “deal”—but a deal to do what?

In January, Trump threatened “strong” military action against Iran if its leaders killed any of the growing mass of anti-government protesters. Tehran canceled the execution of one protester, leading Trump to pronounce his demand satisfied. However, troops and police proceeded to mow down thousands, possibly tens of thousands, of protesters in the streets, to no objection from Washington. As was the case in Venezuela, democracy and human rights were pieces of Trump’s original war rhetoric—but not in his war policy.

Many were shocked when his real policy in Venezuela turned out to be abducting its criminal president, Nicolás Maduro, and compelling his successors—who had been deputies in Maduro’s Cabinet—to cede control of their country’s oil to the United States. Maria Corina Machado, the leader of Venezuela’s democratic opposition, who expected to take power if Maduro were overthrown, was pushed under the bus. (Her attempt to gain Trump’s favor—giving him the Nobel Peace Prize trophy that she won but that he thought he’d deserved—was a futile gesture.)

So what, exactly, is Trump up to in Iran?

Is he now going after its oil? Probably not, though keeping the oil from being traded to Iran’s biggest customer, China, might be part of the equation. Still, the assembled armada seems overkill for that goal.

Trump says his main concern is to keep Iran from building a nuclear weapon. The irony is that Trump claimed to “obliterate” the nation’s nuclear program in last June’s attack—known as Operation Midnight Hammer—on Iran’s mountain-buried enriched-uranium site. As many noted at the time, Trump exaggerated the extent of the damage; for one thing, Iranians might have removed much of the uranium in anticipation of the assault. However, the damage did significantly set back Iran’s program, perhaps by a few years. What is the rush now?

Iran’s ballistic missiles endanger Israel and U.S. bases in the region. In the brief Iran-Israel war last summer, 90 percent of Iran’s missiles were shot down or crashed before reaching their targets. But Iran launched 550 missiles, as well as 1,000 drones, and the 50 or so that pierced through the defenses inflicted considerable damage. It is not known how many missiles Iran has now—probably a few thousand. Manufacturing sites are concentrated and can be taken out fairly easily, but the missiles themselves are small and mobile. Many would survive an initial onslaught, and if Tehran’s leaders think their regime is about to be crushed, they might decide to launch a massive retaliation, bringing down their enemies along with themselves. In fact, in recent weeks, some Middle East leaders, notably the Saudis and other Sunnis (who have been fighting proxy wars against Iran on various fronts) urged Trump not to attack Iran, fearing that Iran would return fire against their lands too. They have barred U.S. planes from flying over their territory if Trump does decide to attack.

Here, then, is another irony. As a result of last summer’s missile exchanges, June’s Midnight Hammer, and a string of devastating attacks on Iran’s main proxy militias, Hamas and Hezbollah, Israel is now stronger and Iran is weaker than they have been in decades. Trump’s mobilization in the region underlines this disparity. Does Iran really pose a threat that justifies such a massive U.S. reaction?

Then again, from Israel’s perspective, Iran’s relative weakness is the point. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has long pushed for regime change in Tehran. Though he never said so explicitly, his opposition to the Iran nuclear deal, which President Barack Obama and six other leaders signed in 2014, wasn’t so much fear of an Iranian bomb (the accord really did all but stop its development) as fear that the removal of Iran’s sanctions and its integration into the world economy—the rewards for dismantling its nuclear apparatus—would solidify the Islamic Republic’s position, strengthen its international standing, and thereby increase Israel’s vulnerability, if not to nuclear bombs, then to other forms of intimidation. During Trump’s first term, Netanyahu persuaded him to rip up the nuclear deal; with the president now in his second term, the prime minister is hoping to lasso him into finishing off the regime.

The Iranian government is a horror. It represses its own people, now more than ever; it assists terrorists; and it’s an economic disaster as well. But it’s worth asking: If the mullahs are toppled or lose their grip on power in one way or another, who replaces them? It’s extremely unlikely that the successors would be the Western-leaning urban youth who have been demonstrating in the streets. They lack leaders and organizers, mainly because the regime has imprisoned or killed rising potential leaders—and disabled or co-opted tools and technologies that could enable organization.

If the mullahs fell, power would likely be picked up by the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps. This is the Iranian army’s elite unit, with more than 150,000 personnel, who protect the regime, control much of the economy, and are no less hostile than the supreme leader and his mullahs toward Israel, Sunnis, and the West.

It’s possible that U.S. and Israeli intelligence agencies have made contact with certain IRGC officers, discussing terms of mutual support in the event of regime change. We now know that the CIA infiltrated the Venezuelan leadership, which helped the U.S. Special Forces track down Maduro. However, we don’t yet know whether or how long Venezuela’s old-new leaders will keep to their side of whatever long-term bargain they might have struck. It’s doubly uncertain whether any emerging IRGC strongmen—with whom the U.S. has had no aboveground relationship at all—would honor any deal. It’s a very poor bet to act on the assumption that they would.

Which leads to the final possibility: that Trump is amassing all this firepower to pressure the Iranians to make a deal. He has said that, to avoid dreadful consequences, Iran must agree to enrich no uranium, dismantle its ballistic missiles, and sever relations with Shiite militias in the region.

The problem is that these terms are untenable to Iran, and would be even if the country had more-pliant leaders.

In the early stages of negotiation toward the 2014 nuclear deal, Obama also pushed for a ban on enrichment but soon realized that this was a dead end. The Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (which is observed by 191 nation-states, including Iran) not only allows its signatories to enrich uranium to 3 percent purity, but it enshrines that level of enrichment as a right. This level is very low. “Highly enriched” uranium is defined as 20 percent, “weapons-grade” as 90 percent. The treaty further allows international inspectors to verify whether countries are abiding with this limit. Obama’s Iran nuclear deal had tight inspection procedures; Iran was declared in compliance.

For Iran to accept a ban on enrichment, when the rest of the world is entitled to some, would be tantamount to surrender before a shot has been fired. No leader, Islamist or otherwise, would accept this.

A ban on ballistic missiles is also unlikely, as they are Iran’s main source of deterrence. Iran’s support for radical militias—such as Hamas, Hezbollah, and the Houthis—does clarify the regime’s nature: A government can legitimately observe a right to bear conventional arms and enrich uranium (a little bit, anyway) but not to arm havoc-wreaking militias. Still, the Iranians have relied so heavily on these militias for power in the region that they would need tangible benefits to cut the cord.

What is the Trump administration offering Iran in return for taking such extraordinary measures? The question is misleading. There is no “Trump administration” when it comes to such matters. There is only Trump and his two emissaries, fellow real-estate tycoon Steve Witkoff and Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner. They have supplanted, and for the most part ignored, the experienced experts in the State Department and the National Security Council who usually hammer out positions and handle negotiations.

Witkoff has no diplomatic experience whatever. Kushner did play a role in the Abraham Accords, which formalized diplomatic and economic relations between Israel and some Arab states (the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, and Morocco), but those nations already had informal relations, and they were not at all in a state of war.

Like Trump, they seem to believe that diplomacy requires no special knowledge and that dealmaking is dealmaking, whether you’re dealing with the Kremlin, the Islamic Republic of Iran, or the New York City Buildings Department. This blithe arrogance is naivete disguised as hardheadedness, and it goes a long way toward explaining the pair’s utter failure at settling the war in Ukraine. (There, they don’t grasp Russian President Vladimir Putin’s motive for war. If they did, they would realize that he doesn’t want peace without the complete subjugation of Kyiv.)

What happens these next few days in and around Iran? Who knows. It’s possible Trump himself doesn’t know. The Iranians will try to stretch out the negotiations, which they probably see as inherently fruitless. Trump may wait them out for a while, but perhaps not for long. If he starts a war, he may try to keep it limited at first, but the Iranians may escalate, anticipating their worst-case scenario, which Trump may then make a self-fulfilling prophecy.

Wars, once started, sometimes spiral out of control. This is why it’s smart for leaders to know what they want, and know how far they want to press things, before they make their first move. It’s also why, in negotiating a peaceful way out of a crisis, it’s good for them to know what the other side wants too—not necessarily to appease them but to scope out the boundaries of what’s possible without war and, given that, whether it’s better to modify peace terms or go to war.

At this point, it looks like Trump, pushed by Netanyahu, is rushing into conflict recklessly.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Sign up for Executive Dysfunction, a weekly newsletter that surfaces under-the-radar stories about what Trump is doing to the law—and how the law is pushing back.

On Jan. 26, U.S. District Judge Michael Farbiarz prohibited ICE from moving an immigrant, Baljinder Kumar, out of New Jersey while he challenged his unlawful detention. Five days later, Immigration and Customs Enforcement flagrantly defied that order, transferring Kumar to a detention center in … Texas. After his lawyers complained, federal officials returned Kumar to New Jersey. But Farbiarz was not inclined to let this disobedience go unpunished. He informed the New Jersey U.S. attorney’s office that he sought to craft a “remedy” for ICE’s defiance—and would require an “investigation” to assist him. He then ordered the office to investigate itself and to “enumerate each instance” in which it had “violated an order issued by a judge of this district” since Dec. 5.

Last Friday, Jordan Fox—an associate deputy attorney general and special attorney assigned to New Jersey—gave Farbiarz an answer: The office had violated at least 56 court orders since December alone, all related to the Trump administration’s unlawful policy mandating the indefinite detention of noncitizens legally entitled to a bond hearing. This confession, first reported by Politico’s Kyle Cheney, was accompanied by a letter stating that “we regret deeply all violations” but insisting that they were “unintentional and immediately rectified once we learned of them.” Fox, who is helping lead the New Jersey office after courts ousted Donald Trump’s first choice, Alina Habba, depicted these transgressions as relatively minor and rare. But Farbiarz did not buy it, noting that Kumar’s illegal transfer to Texas was far from an “outlier.”

On this week’s Slate Plus bonus episode of Amicus, co-hosts Dahlia Lithwick and Mark Joseph Stern discussed this court-ordered investigation, its startling conclusions, and the possible consequences. A preview of their conversation, below, has been edited and condensed for clarity.

Dahlia Lithwick: I guess I have to give credit where it’s due. Jordan Fox took one for the team and laid out, chapter and verse, all the court orders this office had violated.

Mark Joseph Stern: Sort of. Fox actually excluded two categories of violations, missed status update deadlines and late docket notifications. When you include those, it’s 75 violations. So let’s dig into these numbers. At least 17 times, the government transferred a noncitizen to a different detention facility after a court unambiguously prohibited it from doing so. That means they were detained in another state, where it would be harder to reach their lawyers, and perhaps where judges are more inclined to rule for the government. At least 10 times, the U.S. attorney’s office failed to produce evidence ordered by the court. And at least one time, the government deported a noncitizen in direct contravention of a court order forbidding that deportation.

In some ways, this is a bigger deal than the ICE lawyer’s meltdown in court a few weeks ago. We now have the U.S. attorney’s office not going rogue here, but admitting under oath that it has breached court orders more than 50 times. And there were often dire consequences for the people whose rights were violated. Fox tried to paint this as a few errors around the edges, but to me it depicts a complete breakdown of the system. And it shows that if you sign up for this work—if you agree to work in a U.S. attorney’s office—you now know you will be violating court orders, maybe on the daily. Everybody is on notice: If you are assigned to handle these cases, you will violate court orders, and you may be held in contempt.

I’m old enough to remember Judge James Boasberg trying to ascertain whether his court order around the rendition flights to CECOT prison was flouted, and the lies and deceit that went into gaslighting him about that. And he’s still trying to get to the bottom of it! We talked about that story obsessively last spring. A year later, defiance of court orders doesn’t capture two weeks of a news cycle. We just say: Yeah, they do that now. They don’t care what judges think anymore. The American public has somehow normalized this.

All I can say is bless Boasberg for continuing to push that contempt case. I am glad to hear the rising chorus of other judges doing the same. We’ve seen Republicans in Congress say they want to impeach judges who hold Trump administration officials in contempt. Maybe this could be a Spartacus moment where you can’t impeach them all?

That takes us back to Minnesota, where Judge Laura Provinzino found Special Assistant U.S. Attorney Matthew Isihara in civil contempt during a Wednesday hearing for violating a court order. She said she’d fine him $500 a day until the government complied. One interesting piece of this story is that Isihara is a JAG attorney who was conscripted to help with the flood of habeas petitions in response to the mass detention policy as prosecutors continue to flee the Justice Department. And even he said he couldn’t handle the caseload.

This story illustrates the mix of incompetence and malice that is defining the administration’s mass detention campaign. The government arrested this individual, Rigoberto Soto Jimenez, at his workplace in January—even though he had lived here since 2018 and has no criminal record or a final order of removal authorizing his deportation. ICE then hustled him to Texas. His lawyers still managed to persuade Provinzino to issue a writ of habeas corpus ordering his immediate release in Minnesota and the return of all confiscated property.

The government did neither. It released him in Texas, not Minnesota, and withheld all of his property, including his driver’s license and other identification paperwork. So he was just dumped and abandoned. His lawyers had to go to Provinzino and tell her that her order had been flagrantly violated, which is when she scheduled the hearing. Soto Jimenez managed to make his way back from Texas, but as of Wednesday, ICE still hadn’t returned his identification cards. So Provinzino held Isihara, the JAG lawyer detailed to this case, in civil contempt until the cards were returned, with the $500 daily sanction. Fox 9 News reports that her order finally prompted the agency to mail back the ID cards. Which gives us the answer to the question we’ve been asking: What will it take to make ICE comply with the law? The answer is dragging JAGs into your courtroom and holding them in contempt.

The caseload is impossible. Nobody can do this volume of work. If you are a government lawyer thinking, Step aside, Mr. Isihara, because I can do this better next time, just know you’re being set up to pay $500 a day for the privilege.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Uncle Sam&#39;s cyber defenders have given federal agencies just three days to patch a maximum-severity Dell bug that&#39;s been under active exploitation since at least mid-2024.

CISA this week added the flaw, tracked as CVE-2026-22769, to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities catalog, ordering civilian agencies to secure affected systems by February 21 – giving them just three days to get fixes in place.

&quot;These types of vulnerabilities are frequent attack vectors for malicious cyber actors and pose significant risks to the federal enterprise,&quot; CISA warned, underscoring the urgency behind the unusually tight remediation window.

The bug affects Dell RecoverPoint for Virtual Machines and stems from hardcoded credentials that can allow attackers to gain unauthorized access. Dell disclosed and patched the issue earlier this week, noting that criminals had already been exploiting it before a fix was available.

&quot;We have received a report of limited active exploitation of this vulnerability,&quot; a Dell spokesperson told The Register at the time, urging customers to get the recommended mitigations in place pronto.

Researchers say the bug quickly found its way into a broader espionage playbook tied to suspected China-nexus operators. According to Google&#39;s Mandiant incident response team, miscreants have exploited the vulnerability since at least mid-2024 to move laterally across networks, maintain persistence, and deploy a range of malware families.

Among the tools seen in the wild are the Brickstorm backdoor and a newer implant called Grimbolt, which, in some cases, has been swapped in for older malware. Researchers also spotted attackers spinning up so-called &quot;Ghost NICs&quot; on virtual machines to quietly pivot around compromised environments without tripping alarms.

A cluster tracked as UNC6201 has used the flaw to deploy multiple payloads, including Slaystyle, Brickstorm, and Grimbolt, during long-running intrusions, according to Mandiant. The firm says it knows of fewer than a dozen confirmed victims so far, though the true number could be higher.

Mandiant says the activity shares some hallmarks with Silk Typhoon, a Chinese state-backed espionage crew known for targeting government agencies and previously tied to breaches involving custom malware. The group has repeatedly exploited zero-day bugs to break into sensitive networks, including US federal systems.

The latest directive continues a pattern of rapid-fire patch orders from CISA as it tries to shrink the window between disclosure and remediation for actively exploited bugs. Just last week, the agency similarly gave federal agencies three days to lock down BeyondTrust Remote Support instances against a separate remote code execution flaw.

When CISA slaps a bug on the KEV list with a three-day deadline, it&#39;s less a gentle reminder and more a flashing neon sign that says patch now, ask questions later. ®

            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2026/02/20/from_agile_to_ai_anniversary/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">25 years after the Agile Manifesto, a group of experts hosted by one its signatories met to consider the impact of AI on software development, concluding among other things that test-driven development has never been more important.

&quot;Test-driven development (TDD) produces dramatically better results from AI coding agents,&quot; says the report [PDF] on the workshop.

&quot;TDD prevents a failure mode where agents write tests that verify broken behavior. When the tests exist before the code, agents cannot cheat by writing a test that simply confirms whatever incorrect implementation they produced.&quot;

TDD is an approach to software development where automated tests are written before the production code. The tests are expected to fail until the code is written. TDD is valuable for iterative development and refactoring – improving code without changing its behavior – since it verifies that the code continues to behave as expected.

The Agile Manifesto was composed by a group of IT professionals in February 2001, and influential in its promotion of a collaborative, flexible and iterative approach to software development. One of its signatories was Martin Fowler, chief scientist at software development company Thoughtworks. Fowler and Thoughtworks hosted the workshop 25 years on, to &quot;rethink how software is built&quot; in the light of &quot;a new inflection point: the shift to AI-native software development.&quot;

The workshop – conducted under the Chatham House Rule, where participants&#39; names and affiliations are not disclosed – identified engineering discipline as a key topic surrounding AI coding. If AI writes the code, the rigor that used to live in coding &quot;does not disappear, it moves elsewhere,&quot; the report states. The question that &quot;surfaced in nearly every session&quot; is how to retain engineering discipline in the context of AI-driven development.

When a team is given AI tools, the bottleneck shifts from engineering capacity to other elements of software development, according to the report, including cross-team dependencies, architecture reviews, and project decisions. &quot;The result is not faster delivery. It is the same speed with more frustration,&quot; the workshop concluded.

An issue with AI development is that, as with human teams, agents working on different parts of a project will use divergent patterns and preferences. AI accelerates this drift, and there is a question about whether standardization should be attempted, or divergence embraced.

Although experienced developers are more effective at supervising AI agents, thanks to their understanding of system architecture, junior developers also have increased value, the report suggests. &quot;They are better at AI tools than senior engineers, having never developed the habits and assumptions that slow adoption.&quot;

Security is &quot;dangerously behind,&quot; according to the report, because it tends to be treated as something to solve later.

A consistent pattern is that established practices, tools and organizational structures are now &quot;breaking in predictable ways under the weight of AI-assisted work,&quot; the report states. People are experiencing &quot;an identity shift in their professional lives&quot; according to participants. There is an unsolved problem of &quot;how to build trust in systems that are inherently non-deterministic.&quot;

In the light of this AI shift, should there now be a new manifesto?&quot; No, &quot;it&#39;s way too early,&quot; said Fowler. &quot;People are still experimenting with ideas, still trying stuff.&quot;

He added: &quot;I don&#39;t have a lot of time for manifestos. Most of them are wisely ignored by most people,&quot; though he acknowledged that the Agile Manifesto was an exception. ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Two former Google engineers and a third alleged accomplice are facing federal charges after prosecutors accused them of swiping sensitive chip and security technology secrets and then trying to cover their tracks when the scheme began to unravel.

According to the Department of Justice, sisters Samaneh and Soroor Ghandali, both former Google employees, along with Mohammadjavad Khosravi, who worked at another unnamed technology company, have been charged with conspiracy, theft of trade secrets, and obstruction of justice.

The indictment alleges the trio misappropriated confidential information from multiple firms, including Google, spanning processor security and cryptography technologies, and that some of the data was exfiltrated to unauthorized locations, including Iran.

The DOJ says that while working at Google, Samaneh Ghandali allegedly transferred hundreds of internal files, including trade secrets, to a third-party communications platform and shared them in channels associated with the defendants. Soroor Ghandali is accused of transferring numerous files as well, with prosecutors claiming the data later turned up on personal devices and other systems connected to the group.

Authorities say the alleged scheme went beyond simple downloads, with steps taken to hide the activity, including destroying records, submitting false statements, and even photographing screens rather than moving documents directly.

Khosravi, who is married to Samaneh Ghandali, is accused of coordinating with the sisters and accessing sensitive information through his own unnamed employer.

Google didn&#39;t respond to The Register&#39;s questions, but told Bloomberg that it caught wind of the alleged activity through its own internal defenses before bringing in the feds.

&quot;We have enhanced safeguards to protect our confidential information and immediately alerted law enforcement after discovering this incident,&quot; said a Google spokesperson.

Law enforcement officials were keen to frame the case as more than just an internal corporate spat. &quot;The alleged actions outlined in this indictment reflect a calculated betrayal of trust by individuals accused of stealing trade secrets from the very tech companies that employed them. According to the allegations, the method in which confidential data was transferred by the defendants involved deliberate steps to evade detection and conceal their identities,&quot; said FBI Special Agent in Charge Sanjay Virmani.

&quot;Protecting Silicon Valley innovation and defending the groundbreaking technologies that drive our economy and national security is a top priority for the FBI. We will continue to work with our private sector partners to hold accountable anyone who seeks to unlawfully exploit American ingenuity,&quot; he added. ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The UK&#39;s data protection watchdog has scored a small win in a lengthy legal battle against a British retail group that lost millions of data records during a 2017 breach.

You can read Lord Justice Warby&#39;s decision, handed down yesterday, here [PDF].

The Information Commissioner&#39;s Office (ICO) originally fined DSG Retail £500,000 ($673,000) in 2020, the maximum financial penalty allowed under the Data Protection Act 1998 (DPA 1998) – the relevant legislation at the pre-GDPR time.

Its monetary penalty notice (MPN) was upheld by the Court of Appeal&#39;s first-tier tribunal but later reversed by the upper tribunal [PDF], which sided with DSG Retail and, if that decision was final, would have effectively nullified the ICO&#39;s fine.

Important to the case is the nature of the data that was stolen. Hackers installed malware on 5,390 tills across consumer electronics stores Currys PC World and Dixons Travel, both of which DSG owns.

The malware went unnoticed for nine months, hoovering up 5.6 million payment card details and the personal information belonging to around 14 million people, the ICO confirmed when issuing its MPN.

Then-commissioner Steve Eckersley said at the time that the ICO&#39;s findings were &quot;concerning&quot; and related to &quot;basic, commonplace security measures,&quot; that ultimately showed &quot;a complete disregard&quot; for customers&#39; data.

The point of contention, central to the protracted legal case, is whether the card details the attackers scooped up could be used to identify cardholders. The trove of personal data accessed separately from the payment details is not something being debated in this case.

Crucially, the card details involved were the long 16-digit card number and expiry dates, but not the names on the cards.

DSG argues that this specific aspect of the case does not amount to a personal data breach since the hackers could not identify people from the payment card details alone. DSG acknowledges that it, as an organization, could make the link between the card data and real individuals, but says the attackers could not.

The upper tribunal ruled against the ICO, arguing that the case should be viewed from the perspective of the attackers. If they couldn&#39;t use the card data to identify people, then that data should not be considered personal data within the context of a DPA 1998 offense.

Lord Justice Warby concluded on Thursday that this argument was incorrect, siding with the ICO, sending the case back to the first-tier tribunal which ruled correctly in the first instance.

His judgment challenged the upper tribunal&#39;s interpretation of the law, saying that personal data must be viewed from the perspective of the controller; if it can lead to the identification of an individual, in this case, at DSG Retail, then it is personal data.

The relevant statute requires data controllers to safeguard this data, regardless of whether a third party could use it to identify individuals.

Lord Justice Warby added that the upper tribunal&#39;s thinking could lead to confusing consequences if that was indeed the correct interpretation of the DPA 1998.

The same approach would effectively free data controllers of the burden of protecting data in the event of a ransomware attack, for example, provided the attacker could not use it to identify people.

&quot;It is implicit in the reasoning of the UT, and in DSG&#39;s submissions, that such interventions are essentially harmless from the perspective of data subjects, so long as the malicious actor is not able to identify the people to whom the data relate, so that a duty to guard against them would be pointlessly burdensome,&quot; Lord Justice Warby ruled. &quot;I do not accept that.&quot;

He went on to discuss the possibility of jigsaw identification, whereby attackers could use the vast amounts of personal data that are accessible online, through various sources, as a means to identify the cardholders.

&quot;Technology has vastly increased in sophistication. The ability to locate, assemble, and combine disparate items to elicit information about individuals is greatly enhanced. It will often prove impossible to rule out the risk that unauthorized access to part of a data set, which does not itself identify any individual, could lead to processing by some unknown third party with (legitimate) access to the means of identification.&quot;

Now that the Court of Appeal has ruled that DSG had a legal duty to safeguard the payment card data as personal data, the first-tier tribunal will review the case within the context of this judgment.

DSG could appeal the tribunal&#39;s decision, sending it back again to the upper tribunal. If disputes remain, it could become a matter for the UK Supreme Court.

Binnie Goh, general counsel at the ICO, said: &quot;Today&#39;s judgment is a significant victory, bringing much-needed clarity for people affected by cyber attacks as well as industry.

&quot;We welcome the CoA&#39;s confirmation that organisations must protect all personal data they process, regardless of how it might be used or exploited by hackers. This recognises that even if hackers can&#39;t identify people individually from stolen datasets, cyberattacks can and do still cause real harm.

&quot;With the rising threat of cybercrime, this decision strengthens our ability to take robust action in the future and sends a clear message to all organisations: you have a protective duty to safeguard the personal data you hold.&quot;

Curry&#39;s PLC, the current trading name of DSG Retail, did not respond to our requests for comment. ®

            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2026/02/20/making_tax_digital_exemptions/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The UK tax collector has exempted 661 people from moving to quarterly software-based reporting under its Making Tax Digital (MTD) scheme, about half the number who have applied.

UK treasury minister Dan Tomlinson said that as of January 31, HM Revenue and Customs had received 1,271 applications for MTD exemption, decided on 881, turned down 220, and allowed 661.

&quot;Where a taxpayer cannot use MTD for Income Tax, for example due to age or disability, they can apply for exemption from the MTD requirements,&quot; he said in a written parliamentary answer to independent MP James McMurdock.

Those exempted so far make up less than 0.1 percent of the 780,000 sole traders and landlords who by virtue of making more than £50,000 in the 2024-25 tax year must shift to MTD for Income Tax for the tax year starting on April 6.

This requires reports every three months through government-approved software, rather than annual use of HMRC&#39;s existing online services or a paper return.

HMRC said that more than 37,000 people have registered so far and more than 13,500 have submitted a test quarterly update. &quot;We&#39;re working closely with businesses, agents and software providers, and we&#39;re on track to launch Making Tax Digital for Income Tax in April,&quot; said a spokesperson.

&quot;Thousands more customers are signing up every day and we urge customers to check out our guidance on GOV.UK to find out what they need to do.&quot;

HMRC said it has run more than 300 online and face-to-face events, and is writing to those affected before April with a QR code and URL linking to explanatory pages on GOV.UK.

Those in scope need to file their first quarterly report by August 7 and HMRC will not start issuing penalty points until the 2027-28 tax year, after which it will fine those who rack up four late submissions.

HMRC&#39;s list of approved software includes free options and &quot;bridging&quot; software that can extract the required numbers from spreadsheets, but many sole traders and landlords will pay. In a previous assessment, HMRC estimated that those earning more than £50,000 will pay about £350 each to make the transition and then annual costs of £115.

In April 2027, a further 970,000 sole traders and landlords who make more than £30,000 in the current tax year will have to move to MTD. HMRC&#39;s assessment reckoned that the two groups will pay a total of £561 million in one-off costs and spend £196 million more each year as a result, while it expected to spend around £500 million on IT and other costs by end of March 2028.

However, it estimated that the move will bring in £780 million more tax in the 2028-29 financial year, including through reduced customer errors. It also claims MTD will benefit businesses by saving them time on their annual tax return – which will still be required, although it will be populated with data from the quarterly reports – and improving their productivity.

Following a government decision in March 2025, a further 975,000 people who make more than £20,000 in the 2026-27 tax year will have to shift to MTD in April 2028. Businesses registered for value-added tax (VAT) have been required to use MTD software for quarterly reporting since April 2019. ®

            <div id="article-text">On Call By the end of the working week, it&#39;s natural to feel the walls closing in a little, which is why every Friday morning The Register frees things up a little by publishing a new installment of On Call – the reader-contributed column that shares your tech support stories.

This week, we present another story from a reader we recently Regomized as Carl, who in the early 1990s took a job doing desktop and local area network support at a US police department that operated a prison.

Carl arrived to find an enormous to-do list and a very busy IT team who were strangely unwelcoming.

Not long after starting, Carl was assigned a job in the prison. As it was his first visit, a colleague named &quot;Mike&quot; showed him the ropes.

&quot;I was introduced to various guards and went through the first security checkpoint,&quot; he told On Call. &quot;The heavy iron door slamming behind me was a bit nerve-wracking. The second wasn&#39;t so bad.&quot;

But when he encountered orange jumpsuit-clad prisoners, who per procedure stopped their daily chores and moved to stand against the nearest wall when civilians entered the prison, Carl knew he wasn&#39;t in Kansas anymore.

Carl and Mike eventually arrived at the problematic PC. A little effort showed the issue was actually with a mainframe, so another team reset a terminal session and the PC started behaving again.

Job done, Mike introduced Carl to some more guards and then told him to make his own way back to the IT team&#39;s office, a journey that involved a turn to the left and a short walk.

Carl did as he was told and found himself in a dim hallway in which he suddenly saw movement on all sides as prisoners shuffled from the back of small cells and approached him. Some started making obscene remarks. Others removed some clothing and propositioned him.

Yes, dear reader, Mike had pranked Carl by directing him into the holding cells where recently arrested female prisoners awaited their fate.

&quot;Mike and some of the guards showed up, laughing so hard they could barely speak,&quot; Carl told On Call. &quot;It turned out this was a standard hazing routine for some new employees.&quot;

Carl took it well enough and received many slaps on the back.

But he was still stunned by the experience.

&quot;All I could say was &#39;I didn&#39;t know anyone could get tattoos like that,&#39;&quot; which just made Mike laugh even harder.

Have you ever participated in hazing rituals, unwittingly or by design? If so, join the On Call contributors club by clicking here to send us an email so we can tell your story on a future Friday. ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The internet personality has been chasing ICE on the streets of Minneapolis, but fellow locals are divided on whether he’s helping or hurting the cause.

I met Will Stancil two days before he got booted from his neighborhood Signal chat. We were at the Uptown Minneapolis VFW at an event hosted by Rep. Ilhan Omar, a thank-you party for Minnesotans who fought ICE in ways big and small. There were tacos and drinks, and dancing, though I never saw Stancil dance, which is not to say it never happened. A friend of mine who knows of Stancil from his work on school desegregation was surprised I knew who he was. She had no idea he was a combative, divisive online personality. She didn’t know about his arguments with leftists on Bluesky or his fights with white supremacists on X, or about the fact that some of Stancil’s erstwhile opponents have, in light of his new proclivity for chasing and getting tear-gassed by ICE, begrudgingly accepted him as a sort of antihero.

When I approached Stancil, who is almost shockingly boyish-looking in person, he was talking to former New York City comptroller Brad Lander. He had flown to Minneapolis that day to learn about the local response to a federal occupation. Stancil offered to let Lander tag along on one of his ICE patrols — a practice locals now call “commuting” — and said I could join them if I wanted. It’s this openness to media attention that got Stancil kicked out of the Signal group, where many commuters are wary of press, hoping to not draw too much attention. Stancil has talked to, and in some cases been joined by, reporters from CNN, The Atlantic, New York Magazine, The Economist, the Guardian, the Financial Times, the Minnesota Reformer, Racket MN, Mpls. St. Paul Magazine, the Toronto Star, and now The Verge.

For Stancil, the goal of commuting is to create a record of ICE’s abuses. Armed with a phone camera while federal agents are armed with weapons, he’ll record arrests in progress — what everyone now calls “abductions” — and agents’ often violent reactions to being observed. He has taken pepper spray and tear gas to the face on numerous occasions, most of which he has recorded and posted about after the fact. Stancil’s critics, however, think that in making himself a spectacle, he’s putting everyone else at risk. Two major charges have been levied against Stancil. The first is that he’s in it for the attention, perhaps to boost his profile if he runs for office again. (Stancil unsuccessfully ran for State House in 2024. “I’m not saying, ‘Look at me!’ It’s really not about that,” he told me.) The second is that he’s practicing bad OPSEC, not only endangering himself but other members of his community.

He really wanted to talk about the Signal chats

So he was banned from the Signal chat the night before I was scheduled to engage in that rite of passage for out-of-state journalists who had parachuted into Minneapolis: a ride through the neighborhood in Stancil’s Honda Fit. Stancil was apologetic, but more importantly, he was aggrieved. We quickly worked out other arrangements. He was allowed into the Southside Signal group, which has a more open media policy than the Uptown chat from which he’d been ousted. The moderators had asked him to send me a press agreement beforehand. I promised to keep all statements made on the call off-the-record and not to record audio or video of the chat.

I met Stancil before sunrise the next morning, along with Jack, my photographer who had been in Minneapolis for an action-packed two weeks. The city was just waking up. I saw few people on the street on the short drive from the cultural void that is Downtown Minneapolis to Stancil’s apartment Uptown, and most of those I saw were, I assumed based on their neon safety vests, school patrollers. Stancil was waiting for us, idling in his gray Honda Fit. He really wanted to talk about the Signal chats.

“They said, ‘You broke the rule. The rule is no press ever.’ I said, ‘No one’s ever told me that rule before.’ Then they said, ‘You discussed publicly that you were getting kicked out, and that’s breaking the rules.’” Stancil asked for an appeal. The response, he said, was a shrug emoji. The opacity bothered Stancil. So did the way some of his fellow commuters — his neighbors! — were treating this whole thing. “It’s not a guerrilla organization,” he said. “People want to run it that way, all secrecy and cloak-and-dagger, but the reason it works is because there’s so many people doing it.”

We were in unfamiliar territory. That this wasn’t Stancil’s turf was clear. At one point, he took a left when he should’ve taken a right, and Jack had to tell him Cleveland Avenue was actually the other way. A few minutes later, Stancil went the wrong way down a one-way street, accidentally maneuvering us into oncoming traffic. Stancil’s driving was, for the most part, erratic. He pushed the Honda Fit to its limits, speeding to beat yellow lights and running red ones. “It’s a very Minneapolitan thing,” he told me, “to be like, ‘I’m chasing a federal agent but there’s a yellow light. Oh no, I have to stop!’”

Minnesotans are a polite, rule-following bunch, and they regard traffic laws with quasi-religious reverence. When I visited in 2024 for the state fair, I was simultaneously shocked and delighted by multiple pieces of seed art dedicated to one highway adage: “merge like a zipper, you’ll get there quicker.” ICE agents were identifiable by their disregard for the rules of the road, to make no mention of their unfamiliarity with wintry streets. But commuters had started driving erratically, too — Stancil especially. How would they ever catch up to ICE otherwise?

It was a slow day. We drove around Southside for an hour, maybe an hour and a half, and ICE sightings across the neighborhood were sporadic. There was none of the action Stancil had grown accustomed to seeing. On a ride-along with a reporter a week earlier, Stancil had run into ICE almost immediately after getting on the road and was tear-gassed within minutes of exiting the car. We were, depending on how you look at it, either lucky or unlucky. We drove and drove and nothing happened, giving Stancil plenty of time to talk about previous interactions he’s had with ICE, arrests he’s witnessed, and, of course, about his ejection from the Signal chat.

“I know for a fact people who previously hated each other’s guts and are now working together”

Every few minutes he’d interrupt himself mid-sentence to listen to the Signal call or focus on a particularly ICE-looking car. An SUV with tinted windows aroused suspicion until we saw the driver: he was alone and smoking a cigarette, so he probably wasn’t a fed. Stancil told me about a Chevy Silverado he’d seen on the street that was “a confirmed ICE vehicle” despite being “highly unconventional.” He had seen it again the previous day while commuting with Brad Lander, who got out of Stancil’s car to greet the two men sitting in the Silverado. “And they just go roaring out of there,” Stancil said, but not before Lander saw the tactical gear they had on. “They’re trying to scope people out or something, because we saw them over and over.” He wanted to see them again today. He wanted to figure out what they were doing. The Silverado was Stancil’s white whale and he was desperate to find it.

We drove past a van that had “NOT ICE” written on it, which could either mean it definitely wasn’t ICE or absolutely was. Agents had reportedly been disguising their cars — adding bumper stickers, installing bike racks — to throw off observers. All this subterfuge had created a culture of paranoia in the Twin Cities and with good reason. Federal officials accused both Renee Good and Alex Pretti of being “domestic terrorists” and suggested that anyone involved in any kind of anti-ICE activity is part of a coordinated criminal operation. Dozens of people have been arrested, some on federal charges, and it’s likely that more are coming: the Department of Homeland Security subpoenaed Google, Meta, Discord, and Reddit, asking for the names, email addresses, phone numbers, and other information of people who have been tracking ICE.

Will Stancil the person is not dissimilar to Will Stancil the internet personality. Both are frenetic, jumping from topic to topic with an intensity that despite its effortlessness cannot be described as ease. Where Stancil’s online persona seemingly delights in picking and escalating fights with his many critics, the flesh-and-blood Stancil is affable if not necessarily charming. He proffered a kumbaya-esque description of the city’s response to the federal occupation: before ICE came to town, Minneapolis was beset by “horrible factional infighting” between leftists, liberals, and moderates. Now everyone has set their differences aside to vanquish a common enemy. “I know for a fact people who previously hated each other’s guts and are now working together,” he said.

He told me about someone he knows “high up on the moderate Democrat side of things” whose posts now read as if they were written by a member of the Democratic Socialists of America.

“Even with me,” Stancil said, “I’ve had people come to me like, ‘You know, I’ve said some things [about you].’ And it’s like, I don’t care. Who cares? I don’t even remember. Set it aside. That’s been nice to see. Hopefully it sticks. It’s been genuinely inspiring to see so many people come together.”

This newfound sense of unity has its limits. Stancil, after all, was removed from the group chat, a point he returned to again and again in our conversation. “One reason I’m a little sad about getting kicked out of the group, and this is corny as all get out, is that there’s something about, they’re coming for my neighbors. They’re coming from my part of town. Over here, the people I see on the street are people I know. Over there, I don’t know them. That’s a really special thing that’s getting a lot of people up in the morning.”

Stancil is exceedingly earnest. He canceled a doctor’s appointment to spend the morning tailing ICE, even in this unfamiliar neighborhood. His outrage at the federal occupation of the Twin Cities is palpable, and in this he is no different from other left-of-center Minnesotans whose politics aren’t exactly radical — he is in some ways, in fact, further to the left than the “Edina wine moms,” in the words of one organizer I met, who have recently found themselves joining the cause — except those other liberal-but-not-leftist Minnesotans tend to keep a low profile both on- and offline, and therefore aren’t getting into fights with socialists and anarchists over things like OPSEC and the efficacy or futility of talking to the media.

Perhaps because of his outsize internet presence, Stancil’s removal from the Signal chat sparked a weeks-long discourse cycle on Bluesky and X that appears to have no end in sight. Throughout it all, Stancil has doubled down. The occupation may have brought together liberals, leftists, and anarchists, but only to a point.

Both on- and offline, people have argued over whether Stancil’s penchant for posting through it — a tendency his supporters consider openness and his detractors consider exhibitionism or perhaps self-centeredness — is detrimental to the cause. The discord has bled out into real life. Some locals I met told me they didn’t have a problem with Stancil letting journalists join him; they had indeed taken me commuting with them. Other organizers told me his antics put everyone at risk. One source said they’d retract their interview if it appeared in the same piece as Stancil’s. And in early February, the week after Stancil and I met, a video circulated online of someone punching Stancil. It’s unclear what led to the confrontation, but the video shows a small group of masked people surrounding Stancil, who mocks his soon-to-be attackers. “Shut up, man. I’ve done so — I’ve done a lot more than you have,” Stancil tells them. “Shut up. Jackass.”

“One thing you’ll hear a lot in left-wing circles is that this proves community policing works,” Stancil said of ICE watches. “I would say the opposite. This is exhausting, inefficient, there’s a lot of false positives, a lot of people get away. It requires massive resources. But we’re only doing it because more traditional mechanisms have broken down here or aren’t available for us. And it has worked because of the scale of it, but you can’t have 5,000 people a day randomly patrolling their neighborhoods. In the long-term, it’s not viable.”

This was one of those slow days that made the whole thing feel futile. We drove in circles in search of ICE and saw nothing, a stillness that implied they were active elsewhere, in another neighborhood or a nearby suburb, even if they weren’t here.

And then he saw the Silverado. I noticed it before he did but wasn’t sure it was the same car — the one he described was green, and this one was a sort of blue, so I said nothing. The Silverado turned left and we turned right and that’s when Stancil saw it. We were in backed-up traffic on a busy two-way road, which Stancil pulled a U-turn in the middle of to get us where we needed to be. The Silverado sped through a light we couldn’t run without getting T-boned, so we waited impatiently as we watched it get away. When the light turned green, Stancil cut off another car in an attempt to catch up. “He’ll think I’m awful rude,” he said, “but that’s okay. I can live with that on my conscience.”

            <div id="article-text">Brian Boland testified about shifting from ‘deep blind faith’ in Meta to becoming its public critic.

Brian Boland testified about shifting from ‘deep blind faith’ in Meta to becoming its public critic.

Brian Boland spent more than a decade figuring out how to build a system that would make Meta money. On Thursday, he told a California jury it incentivized drawing more and more users, including teens, onto Facebook and Instagram — despite the risks.

Boland’s testimony came a day after Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg took the stand in a case over whether Meta and YouTube are liable for allegedly harming a young woman’s mental health. Zuckerberg framed Meta’s mission as balancing safety with free expression, not revenue. Boland’s role was to counter this by explaining how Meta makes money, and how that shaped its platforms’ design. Boland testified that Zuckerberg fostered a culture that prioritized growth and profit over users’ wellbeing from the top down. He said he’s been described as a whistleblower — a term Meta has broadly sought to limit for fear it would prejudice the jury, but which the judge has generally allowed. Over his 11 years at Meta, Boland said he went from having “deep blind faith” in the company to coming to the “firm belief that competition and power and growth were the things that Mark Zuckerberg cared about most.”

Boland last served as Meta’s VP of partnerships before leaving in 2020, working to bring content to the platform that it could monetize, and previously worked in a variety of advertising roles beginning in 2009. He testified that Facebook’s infamous early slogan of “move fast and break things” represented “a cultural ethos at the company.” He said the idea behind the motto was generally, “don’t really think about what could go wrong with a product, but just get it out there and learn and see.” At the height of its prominence internally, employees would sit down at their desks to see a piece of paper that said, “what will you break today?” Boland testified.

“The priorities were on winning growth and engagement”

Zuckerberg consistently made his priorities for the company abundantly clear, according to Boland. He’d announce them in all hands meetings and leave no shadow of a doubt what the company should be focused on, whether it was building its products to be mobile-first, or getting ahead of the competition. When Zuckerberg realized that then-Facebook had to get into shape to compete with a rumored Google social network competitor (which he didn’t name, but seemed to refer to Google+), Boland recalled a digital countdown clock in the office that symbolized how much time they had left to achieve their goals during what the company called a “lockdown.” During his time at the company, Boland testified, there was never a lockdown around user safety, and Zuckerberg allegedly instilled in engineers that “the priorities were on winning growth and engagement.”

Meta has repeatedly denied that it tries to maximize users’ engagement on its platforms over safeguarding their wellbeing. In the past weeks, both Zuckerberg and Instagram CEO Adam Mosseri testified that building platforms that users enjoy and feel good on is in their long-term interest, and that’s what drives their decisions.

Boland disputes this. “My experience was that when there were opportunities to really try to understand what the products might be doing harmfully in the world, that those were not the priority,” he testified. “Those were more of a problem than an opportunity to fix.”

When safety issues came up through press reports or regulatory questions, Boland said, “the primary response was to figure out how to manage through the press cycle, to what the media was saying, as opposed to saying, ‘let’s take a step back and really deeply understand.” Though Boland said he told his advertising-focused team that they should be the ones to discover “broken parts,” rather than those outside the company, he said that philosophy didn’t extend to the rest of the company.

On the stand the day before, Zuckerberg pointed to documents around 2019 showing disagreement among his employees with his decisions, saying they demonstrated a culture that encourages a diversity of opinion. Boland, however, testified that while that might have been the case earlier in his tenure, it later became “a very closed down culture.”

“There’s not a moral algorithm, that’s not a thing … Doesn’t eat, doesn’t sleep, doesn’t care”

Since the jury can only consider decisions and products that Meta itself made, rather than content it hosted from users, lead plaintiff attorney Mark Lanier also had Boland describe how Meta’s algorithm works, and the decisions that went into making and testing it. Algorithms have an “immense amount of power,” Boland said, and are “absolutely relentless” in pursuing their programmed goals — in many cases at Meta, that was allegedly engagement. “There’s not a moral algorithm, that’s not a thing,” Boland said. “Doesn’t eat, doesn’t sleep, doesn’t care.”

During his testimony on Wednesday, Zuckerberg commented that Boland “developed some strong political opinions” toward the end of his time at the company. (Neither Zuckerberg nor Boland offered specifics, but in a 2025 blog post, Boland indicated he was deleting his Facebook account in part over disagreements with how Meta handled events like January 6th, writing that he believed “Facebook had contributed to spreading ‘Stop the Steal’ propaganda and enabling this attempted coup.”) Lanier spent time establishing that Boland was respected by peers, showing a CNBC article about his departure that quoted a glowing statement from his then-boss, and a reference to an unnamed source who reportedly described Boland as someone with a strong moral character.

On cross-examination, Meta attorney Phyllis Jones clarified that Boland didn’t work on the teams tasked with understanding youth safety at the company. Boland agreed that advertising business models are not inherently bad, and neither are algorithms. He also admitted that many of his concerns involved the content users were posting, which is not relevant to the current case.

During his direct examination, Lanier asked if Boland had ever expressed his concerns to Zuckerberg directly. Boland said he’d told the CEO he’d seen concerning data showing “harmful outcomes” of the company’s algorithms and suggested that they investigate further. He recalled Zuckerberg responding something to the effect of, “I hope there’s still things you’re proud of.” Soon after, he said, he quit.

Boland said he left upwards of $10 million worth of unvested Meta stock on the table when he departed, though he admitted he made more than that over the years. He said he still finds it “nerve-wracking” every time he speaks out about the company. “This is an incredibly powerful company,” he said.

            <div id="article-text">HBO’s medical drama has been teasing out a smart story about what makes gen AI so tempting and concerning.﻿

HBO’s medical drama has been teasing out a smart story about what makes gen AI so tempting and concerning.﻿

Each episode of HBO’s The Pitt features some degree of medical trauma that almost makes the hospital drama feel like a horror series. Some patients are dealing with gnarly lacerations while others are fighting off vicious blood infections that could rob them of their limbs, and the chaos of working in an emergency room often leaves The Pitt’s central characters shaken. But as alarming as many of The Pitt’s more gore-forward moments can be, what’s even more unsettling is the show’s slow-burning subplot about hospitals adopting generative artificial intelligence.

In its second season, The Pitt once again chronicles all the events that happen during a single 15-hour day shift in the Pittsburgh Trauma Medical Center’s emergency room. Season two takes place on the Fourth of July — one of the busiest days for hospitals — as senior attending physician Dr. Michael “Robby” Robinavitch (Noah Wyle) is working one last shift before he takes a much-needed sabbatical. With Dr. Robby scheduled to be away for three months, the hospital brings in Dr. Baran Al-Hashimi (Sepideh Moafi) to help lead the emergency room while he’s away. There’s some personality-based friction between the attendings, but Dr. Robby mostly respects how Dr. Al-Hashimi navigates her work except when she insists that the hospital would be better off if it committed to using a piece of AI-powered transcription software.

Though this season starts off relatively calm, the day becomes increasingly stressful for all of The Pitt’s characters as the hospital becomes filled with people needing medical attention. Staying on top of her work is especially taxing for second-year resident Dr. Trinity Santos (Isa Briones) because she simply doesn’t have enough time to see all of her patients and carefully note all of their symptoms in their medical charts.

Dr. Al-Hashimi knows that AI-generated transcripts aren’t perfect, but she sees Dr. Santos as the perfect example of a doctor who could get through their charting faster with the technology’s help. To the fictional software’s credit, it does accurately transcribe most of Dr. Santos’ dictation. But both doctors are stunned when a surgeon storms into the ER in a rage after receiving charts with very obvious, glaring errors that could have led to patients receiving incorrect care.

Rather than running headlong into a “generative AI is bad and dangerous” ripped-from-the-headlines plot, The Pitt has taken its time to explore the reasons why medical professionals might want to use this kind of technology and the importance of looking at it with some skepticism. Dr. Al-Hashimi encourages her medical students and residents to use the transcription software, but she’s also diligent about warning them that they need to double-check any work completed with AI because they — not their tools — are responsible for how patients are treated. Each of Dr. Al-Hashimi’s warnings come across as The Pitt acknowledging real-world instances of patients suing hospitals over botched surgeries involving the use of AI tools and studies that have found large language models to be unreliable in their ability to accurately predict patient health outcomes. The Pitt also uses Dr. Al-Hashimi’s AI boosterism to hammer home how adopting the technology in professional settings can actually create more busywork (see: double-checking transcriptions) while contributing to people burning out. Initially, Dr. Al-Hashimi seems like she might be a major antagonistic presence this season, but The Pitt’s writing team has very smartly chosen to focus on a bigger idea.

This season of The Pitt has been repeatedly emphasizing that technology can only do so much to solve problems when it isn’t really designed to address the real issue at hand. AI-powered transcription can help Dr. Santos finish charts more quickly (with some errors thrown in for good measure). But the software can’t do much about the emergency room being understaffed, or when the doctors and nurses are suddenly tasked with taking in more patients after another hospital goes on lockdown.

The way characters like Dr. Santos and nurses like Dana Evans (Katherine LaNasa) find themselves inundated with demanding patients who have spent hours in overstuffed waiting rooms feels like a direct reflection of the real-world challenges hospitals across the country are facing. To truly get a hold on their workloads, The Pitt’s ER staff really needs more hands on deck and more space to give patients the appropriate care. But with the country facing a nursing shortage and the fictional hospital being perpetually underfunded, it tracks that administrators would want to try boosting productivity using AI.

The Pitt easily could (and still might before the season’s over) tell a story about how errors caused by using gen AI lead to mistakes in operating rooms that can leave medical professionals open to lawsuits. But the show is right for highlighting the reality that there are some critical workplace issues that can’t be fixed simply by throwing new kinds of technology at them.

Fulu wants developers to come up with a solution that will allow users to store Ring doorbell footage locally on devices.

With Ring facing fierce backlash over its Search Party feature, a new program is challenging developers to move Ring doorbell footage off of Amazon’s cloud — and into users’ own devices. The Fulu Foundation, the consumer advocacy group cofounded by YouTuber Louis Rossmann, is offering an initial bounty of $10,000 to anyone who can integrate Ring doorbells with a local PC or server, while cutting off access to Amazon’s servers.

Ring users currently have to pay a subscription fee to store recordings in Amazon’s cloud. While the company has a local storage option through Ring Edge, it’s only available with the Ring Alarm Pro, and it still requires a subscription. There’s also an option to secure your videos with end-to-end encryption, meaning neither Ring nor third parties can see your footage, but it’s stored on Amazon’s servers.

Now Fulu is hoping someone can give users more control over their footage, following the concerns raised by Ring’s Super Bowl ad for Search Party, an AI-powered feature that uses its network of doorbells to find lost dogs (and maybe to eventually combat crime). Though there are several other smart home brands, including Eufy, Reolink, and Aqara, that offer video doorbells with local storage, Fulu cofounder Kevin O’Reilly says device owners shouldn’t be expected to replace their hardware when concerns stem from software.

“In an ideal world, device owners would be able to modify that software to instead push that footage to their own computer or server, should they so choose,” O’Reilly writes. However, he warns that bounty solutions will be limited by the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, which “means distributing a tool or mechanism for other security-minded Ring owners to circumvent those locks and assert their ownership over their video remains a copyright crime.”

The first person or team to submit a solution that meets Fulu’s eligibility requirements will win the bounty. To qualify, developers must integrate Ring doorbells released in 2021 or later with a local computer or server, and ensure it “no longer sends data to Amazon servers or requires connection to Amazon hardware to function.” The initial bounty starts at $10,000, and Fulu will match any additional donations made by supporters up to $10,000.

It’s hard to buy a bad pair of wireless earbuds these days, and with constant discounts and deals wherever you look, now is as good a time as any to splurge on the pair you’ve been eyeing. The market has come a long way since the early era of true wireless earbuds, when we had to deal with mediocre sound quality and unreliable performance, all for the sake of ditching cables. Things are much different now. After several product generations, companies like Sony, Apple, Bose, and others are releasing their most impressive earbuds to date.

You can get phenomenal noise cancellation and sound quality in the premium tier of earbuds if you’re willing to spend big. But those aren’t always the most important criteria for everyone: maybe you’re looking for the perfect fitness earbuds or for a set that works just as well for Zoom calls as for playing your favorite playlists and podcasts.

Tech companies are increasingly making their earbuds work best with their own products through exclusive features and functionality, so that’s another thing to consider as you shop around. If you want a perk like head-tracking spatial audio, you’ll need to use AirPods with an iPhone, Samsung buds with a Samsung phone, and so on.

Smaller, more comfortable designUpgrades to ANC and sound qualityMuch clearer voice call performance

Glossy texture can make them harder to remove from caseSony’s bonus features aren’t as seamless as those of its competitors

Noise cancellation: Yes / Battery life: 8 hours (ANC on) / Water resistance: IPX4 / Bluetooth codecs: LDAC, AAC, SBC / Multipoint: Yes / Works best with: Android, iOS, Windows, macOS / Ear tips: Foam (XS, S, M, L)

Despite the recent arrival of Sony’s WF-1000XM6 earbuds, the last-gen WF-1000XM5 remain our top recommendation for the best noise-canceling earbuds overall. Thanks to their larger drivers, audio quality is more detailed and dynamic than before while still retaining the warmth and clarity that made the WF-1000XM4 so enjoyable. They also deliver fantastic active noise cancellation, even if it’s not quite as impressive as it is on the newer XM6 or Bose’s Ultra Earbuds gen 2. The XM5 do a terrific job of eliminating background noise, and battery life can stretch to eight hours with ANC turned on.

Some people found the XM4 bulky and uncomfortable, but Sony has managed to shrink the XM5 by 25 percent (the XM6 are longer and narrower). Like before, the company includes foam-style tips that expand in your ears to create an excellent seal — and there’s even a fourth (extra small) set of tips in the box.

On Android phones, the 1000XM5 support Sony’s LDAC codec for higher-quality music playback. And they’re capable of dynamic head tracking spatial audio through supported video apps like Netflix. But even if you’re not using LDAC (or have an iPhone), these are up there with the very best audio-focused premium earbuds — including Sennheiser’s Momentum True Wireless 4, only with substantially better noise cancellation. They’re also capable of multipoint Bluetooth connectivity, so you can pair them with two devices at the same time.

None of that to say the newer XM6 are a bad choice — quite the contrary, actually. Sony’s latest flagships offer improved sound, handle ambient noise better during calls, and deliver some of the best ANC you can get in a pair of wireless earbuds. But they’re also bulkier and pricier than the XM5 given the latter can often be found on sale for around $250, making the last-gen model a better option for most people.

Standout color and designVery compact carrying caseGreat performer for the price

Limited retail availabilityPlastic case can show scuffs

Noise cancellation: Yes / Battery life: 5.5 hours (ANC on) / Water resistance: IP54 / Bluetooth codecs: LDAC, AAC, SBC / Multipoint: Yes / Works best with: Android, iOS, Windows, macOS / Ear tips: Silicone (S, M, L)

When looking at Nothing’s Ear (a) earbuds, it’s easy to focus all your attention on the catchy yellow color or their fun, super compact carrying case. But at their $99 price, the company’s entry-level earbuds provide a ton of features, including active noise cancellation, a low-latency mode for gaming, multipoint Bluetooth pairing, and a decent IP54 dust and water resistance rating.

And the sound quality you get outperforms my usual expectations for this price point, especially since they often can be found for as little as $60. They’re not quite on par with Nothing’s higher-end Ear 3, but you do get expressive, very enjoyable audio — and you can customize the EQ further in Nothing’s mobile app.

Exceptional ANCSecure fitWireless charging case

Noise cancellation: Yes / Battery life: 6 hours (ANC on) / Water resistance: IPX4 / Bluetooth codecs: AAC, SBC, aptX Adaptive / Multipoint: Yes / Works best with: Android, iOS, Windows, macOS / Ear tips: Silicone (S, M, L)

The name Bose has been synonymous with noise cancellation for decades, and it’s again proven why with the QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds (Gen 2). They offer the best noise-canceling performance available in a set of earbuds, delivering the peace and isolation many of us crave throughout the day. The second-gen model bring some much-needed improvements to call quality, too, and while they don’t match the performance of our best call quality picks, the AirPods 4 or Samsung Galaxy Buds, the Bose handle noisy environments far better and allow you to sound like you in conversations.

Although Bose added wireless charging and there’s now a little screen in the ear tips to keep earwax out of the earbuds, there’s no visual upgrade to speak of. The second-gen earbuds maintain a chunky look that’s identical to the first-gen QC Ultra Earbuds, which were already extremely similar to 2022’s QC Earbuds II. They come with three ear tips and three stabilizer sizes, providing a variety of combinations and a secure fit for different ear shapes.

As with the design, the QC Ultra Earbuds (Gen 2) sound nearly identical to their first-gen counterpart. The bass and treble are boosted, providing more bass than competitors and a lively high-end — although it can get to be a bit much on some tracks. Bose continues to stick with its three-band EQ in the app, which doesn’t allow much meaningful adjustment, but most people will appreciate the stock sound. Bose also continues to offer Immersive Audio, first introduced with the Ultra Earbuds, which is similar to Apple’s spatial audio.

Huzzah! Wireless charging!Adds ANC, transparency modes, spatial audioSlimmer ear hook, smaller caseAdds heart rateGreat soundNo price hike

Case is still a chonkerHeart rate is not that useful for iOS users

Noise cancellation: Yes / Battery life: 8 hours (ANC on) / Water resistance: IPX4 / Bluetooth codecs: AAC, SBC / Multipoint: No / Works best with: Android, iOS, Windows, macOS / Ear tips: Silicone (XS, S, M, L, XL)

After a long wait, Beats finally introduced the Powerbeats Pro 2 in early 2025. They carry forward the signature ear hook design of past Powerbeats earbuds, but improve upon the original Powerbeats Pro in several key ways. Beats added active noise cancellation and a natural-sounding transparency mode to the Pro 2; the first-gen pair lacked both. The earbuds themselves are lighter, too, and the charging case is noticeably smaller.

The Powerbeats Pro 2 also feature heart rate monitoring thanks to built-in sensors on each earbud. You might already have a fitness tracker, chest strap, or smartwatch for this purpose, but if not, you can use these with compatible apps like Nike Run Club, Runna, Ladder, Slopes, Open, Peloton, and YaoYao. The downside is that they can’t simultaneously play music and broadcast heart rate to gym equipment when paired to an iOS device, rendering the Pro 2 a better heart rate monitoring alternative for Android users than iPhone users.

The Powerbeats Pro 2 remain rated IPX4 for water resistance. While that’s not as robust as some other fitness-focused buds, it should be sufficient to survive sweat and outdoor runs in various conditions. The earbuds still offer easy-to-use physical buttons and a dedicated volume rocker, so it’s easy to control them in the middle of a workout.

If you’re an iPhone owner, the Powerbeats Pro 2 earbuds include Apple-only features like dynamic head tracking for spatial audio, auto device switching, Find My integration, and more. For Android users, Beats has an app that packs in a smaller subset of these functions.

Improved ANC and soundLonger batteryStandalone workout trackingLive translationSame priceIP57Better fitCamera remote control is handy!

If you’re hoping for traditional foam ear tips, this isn’t that

Noise cancellation: Yes / Battery life: 8 hours (ANC on) / Water resistance: IP57 / Bluetooth codecs: AAC, SBC / Multipoint: No / Works best with: iOS, macOS / Ear tips: Silicone (XXS, XS, S, M, L)

Apple continually adds to the features of the AirPods Pro line — either with a new product like the second-gen AirPods Pro, or with a software update, such as the one that introduced the hearing health features at the end of 2024. The AirPods Pro 3 continue the trend, with improved noise-canceling performance, heart rate sensing, newly designed ear tips with an extra XXS size, and longer battery life. The splashiest update is Live Translation, which, unlike the other improvements, still needs some time to develop into a more streamlined experience.

The new foam-infused earbuds improve passive isolation and, when combined with better ANC performance, deliver the best overall noise cancellation in a pair of Apple earbuds yet. ANC performance is nearly identical to that of the Bose QC Ultra Earbuds (Gen 2), but the AirPods have a slight high-end hiss (though some people might not notice it). A redesign of the acoustic architecture gives the AirPods Pro 3 improved bass performance over the second-gen model, and its spatial audio delivers a wider, richer listening experience.

But what’s important for many Apple users is how well the AirPods Pro 3 fit into the Apple ecosystem. A new heart sensor, first seen with the Powerbeats Pro 2, enables heart rate tracking for 50 workout types from directly within the iOS Fitness app. And unlike the Powerbeats Pro 2, the AirPods can work in conjunction with the Apple Watch, providing a secondary heart rate stream to ensure you always have the most accurate data.

Terrific sound qualityCrisp, natural transparency / passthrough modeVoice commands are simple and so usefulGood voice calls

Samsung’s Galaxy Buds 3 Pro ditch the company’s more discreet designs of the past for a stemmed style that’s similar to AirPods and any number of other wireless earbuds. Boring? Maybe, but thanks to that change, we’ve found them to be more comfortable and provide better stability than the Buds 2 Pro. The sound quality is even better than before — and it was already excellent. These are right up there with Sennheiser and Technics from an audio fidelity standpoint.

The Buds 3 Pro are also a standout performer when it comes to call quality. And our favorite thing about these earbuds are the hands-free voice commands that don’t require you to say any specific wake phrase beforehand. You can just say “volume up” and / or “next song,” and it happens.

But they’re not perfect: the Buds 3 Pro lack multipoint connectivity, so they can’t connect to two devices at the same time. Just like Apple, Samsung prefers to automatically hop between products within its own walled garden ecosystem. Some people might consider this a dealbreaker, but we’ve still enjoyed the earbuds plenty without it.

Smaller and lighter design is supremely comfortableMore powerful noise cancellationCrystal-clear transparency modeVery pleasant and detailed sound quality

ANC can’t quite match BoseGoogle still refuses to add higher-quality Bluetooth codecs, limiting overall fidelityGemini Live feels more feeble than futuristic

With the Pixel Buds Pro 2, Google has addressed most of the downsides of the original pair. They’re far smaller and lighter than the chunky first-gen Pixel Buds Pro. And there’s a small nub on the buds to help keep them in place while performing various activities, including running and other forms of intensive exercise.

Google’s active noise cancellation still isn’t on the same tier as Bose, but the transparency mode on the Buds Pro 2 is among the very best you’ll find. It offers a crisp, natural passthrough for the outside world when needed. Multipoint support is included, and Google’s latest pair of premium earbuds eke out impressive battery life that surpasses most competitors.

Got a Pixel phone? With the Pixel Buds Pro 2, you can have lengthy conversations with Google’s Gemini AI while your phone stays in your pocket. Features like head-tracking spatial audio and Clear Calling are also exclusive to those within the Pixel ecosystem. If that’s you, the Pixel Buds Pro 2 are a big step up from the previous buds in a much smaller package.

Better sound, ANC, and battery life than Studio BudsStandout translucent case optionImproved voice call performance

ANC and transparency fall short of the AirPods Pro 3Doesn’t offer all Apple ecosystem tricksNo wireless charging or in-ear detection

Noise cancellation: Yes / Battery life: 6 hours (ANC on) / Water resistance: IPX4 / Bluetooth codecs: AAC, SBC / Multipoint: No / Works best with: Android, iOS, Windows, macOS / Ear tips: Silicone (XS, S, M, L)

Beats’ Studio Buds Plus are an upgraded, better-performing revision of the Studio Buds released in 2021. This time, the company has made the noise cancellation more powerful while also improving the quality of the transparency mode and extending battery life. If you’re going for style points, it doesn’t get much cooler than the translucent color option. These earbuds are very tiny and rank among the best in terms of overall comfort.

What’s interesting about the Studio Buds Plus is that they use a proprietary chip that allows them to support native software features on both iOS and Android. Plenty of earbuds offer companion apps on each platform, but in the case of the Beats, they work with both Apple’s Find My and Google’s Find Hub networks. You also get simple one-tap pairing, no matter which operating system you’re using.

The drawback to this dual-ecosystem life is that Apple customers don’t get all the usual bells and whistles that come with AirPods or even the Beats Powerbeats Pro 2; you lose out on audio sharing, head tracking spatial audio, and other tricks. Wireless charging and an ear detection sensor (for auto-pause when a bud is removed) are also MIA, which stings a bit considering the price.

Fantastic sound qualityImproved day-to-day reliabilityAuracast-enabled

Too pricey for someNoise cancellation does the job, but isn’t anything specialLong-term durability remains to be seen

Noise cancellation: Yes / Battery life: 7.5 hours (ANC on) / Water resistance: IP54 / Bluetooth codecs: AptX Adaptive, AptX, AAC, SBC / Multipoint: Yes / Works best with: Android, iOS, Windows, macOS / Ear tips: Silicone (XS, S, M, L)

Sennheiser’s Momentum True Wireless earbuds have always sounded fantastic; that’s never been the issue. But previous models in the series have been tainted a bit by bugs, unsteady performance, and battery reliability problems. The fourth-gen pair finally gets that part right while continuing to offer tremendous, detailed sound quality that stands above nearly all competitors. They’re a joy to listen to. The active noise cancellation can’t compete with the likes of Apple, Sony, and Bose, but if you care more about lush, intricate sound, the MTW4 won’t disappoint in the slightest.

These earbuds come with optional wing tips to help keep them securely locked in your ears. That could prove helpful for running or when hitting the gym. Sennheiser allows for plenty of EQ customization using its mobile app, and the Momentum True Wireless 4 support a range of Bluetooth codecs, including AAC, SBC, AptX, and AptX Adaptive. They’re even LE Audio and Auracast-ready for when those features become more widespread.

Upgraded sound qualityVoice isolation can noticeably improve call clarityDeep Apple ecosystem integration

No wireless chargingNo built-in speaker on the caseNo proper multipoint

Noise cancellation: Optional / Battery life: 5 hours / Water resistance: IP54 / Bluetooth codecs: AAC, SBC / Multipoint: No / Works best with: iOS, Windows, macOS / Ear tips: None

Apple’s AirPods 4 come in two different versions, with a higher-priced option that includes active noise cancellation and wireless charging. But sound quality is identical on both sets, and equally as important in this case is that the same can be said of voice call clarity.

On the AirPods 4, there’s a new “voice isolation” feature — enabled by default — that uses machine learning both on the earbuds and your iPhone to eliminate distracting background noise on your end so that you come through clearly to whoever you’re speaking with.

Overall call quality is excellent with the AirPods 4. And beyond that, compared to the third-gen model, you can expect upgraded audio quality (with richer bass), new ways of interacting with Siri through head movements, and yes... there’s a USB-C connector on the included charging case, as opposed to a Lightning port.

The AirPods still have a one-size-fits-most hard plastic form factor, so we recommend trying them before committing to a purchase. However, Apple says it used more than 50 million data points to further refine the contours and overall stability of its latest earbuds. So, if previous models worked well for you, these seem like a safe bet. The only question is whether you feel like spending a little more to gain ANC, a transparency mode, wireless charging, and a built-in speaker for Find My location tracking.

Sony’s unconventional LinkBuds were our longtime pick for the clearest voice calls on Android, but we still haven’t had the chance to review their successors. For now, the aforementioned Galaxy Buds 3 Pro are an easy-to-recommend choice. The built-in “voice pickup unit” detects the movement of your mouth to help isolate your voice from background noise and keep conversations clear.

The Buds 3 Pro have proven dependable for us during video chats on Google Meet and Zoom, and people have been able to hear us without issue, even when answering a quick call on the street.

Whether you’re using earbuds to check out a newly-released album on Spotify, as motivation at the gym, or to tune out distractions around the office, they must deliver on the key metrics of sound quality, noise cancellation, voice call performance, and more. We spend many hours putting our picks through the paces. This includes quiet listening sessions that reveal their full detail, overall fidelity, and dynamics. We also take these buds out into the real world — on rush hour subway commutes, around busy cities, and in crowded cafes — to gauge their connection strength and determine how effectively they can quiet the world around you. We test them on video calls at work and by calling friends and family, who provide blunt feedback on how their mics sound. And importantly, because earbud makers often reserve certain software tricks for their preferred ecosystems, we see how the earbuds fare when used across multiple platforms.

No matter how they sound, what good are earbuds if you don’t enjoy wearing them? Ears come in all shapes and sizes, so the comfort factor is highly subjective. Most of our picks include several sizes of ear tips; usually they’re silicone, but some companies use foam (or both). Again, which you like better comes down to personal preference. Silicone tips are more common, but foam can expand to fill more of your ear for a better seal. The most important tip we can offer is to try different-sized tips in each ear: you might find that one ear needs a bigger or smaller tip than the other.

Just like with comfort, we all have our own inclinations for what we want from sound quality. Some people are bass-heads who can’t live without a thumping low end. Personally, we care more about dynamics, clarity, and definition from the music we’re listening to. We want vocals to ring through naturally and instruments to be well separated in the sound stage. We look for earbuds that can bring out the subtle details in our favorite songs.

What was once a luxury feature is now the status quo. Many of our top picks include active noise cancellation to help quiet the raucous outside world. Whether you’re trying to concentrate at the office or rest while traveling, noise cancellation can be a huge help. However, some people hate the “plugged up” feeling of earbuds and prefer open-style buds that help maintain full awareness of their surroundings.

Most earbuds these days offer between five and six hours of continuous battery life with ANC enabled. Some models can exceed that (and over-ear headphones tend to last much longer on a charge), but the convenience of being able to just pop your earbuds back into their case for more juice makes the tradeoff easier to live with.

Even if you don’t intend to use your earbuds for fitness purposes, there’s always a chance of getting caught out in the rain while wearing them. At a minimum, you should look for earbuds with IPX4 water resistance. This safeguards them from splashes of water (and sweat), so they should be cut out for the hazards of daily life.

Update, February 19th: Updated to reflect current pricing / availability and mention Sony’s newer WF-1000XM6 earbuds. Brandon Widder also contributed to this post.

            <div id="article-text">﻿Horizon Worlds is now going to be a platform that’s ‘almost exclusively mobile.’

﻿Horizon Worlds is now going to be a platform that’s ‘almost exclusively mobile.’

Meta, after laying off about 10 percent of its Reality Labs division, closing three VR studios, stopping new content for VR fitness app Supernatural, and discontinuing its metaverse for work, is announcing a major change for its Horizon Worlds metaverse platform. Instead of attempting to make the 3D social platform work for both VR and mobile, Meta is “explicitly separating” its “Quest VR platform from our Worlds platform” and “shifting the focus of Worlds to be almost exclusively mobile,” Samantha Ryan, Reality Labs’ VP of content, says in a blog post.

The new approach sets Meta up to better compete with platforms like Roblox and Fortnite, which also offer user-generated experiences that can be played on your phone. Horizon Worlds originally launched for VR, but “to truly change the game and tap into a much larger market, we’re going all-in on mobile.”

“We’re in a strong position to deliver synchronous social games at scale, thanks to our unique ability to connect those games with billions of people on the world’s biggest social networks,” Ryan says. “You saw this strategy start to unfold in 2025, and now, it’s our main focus.”

As for VR software, Ryan says Meta is focusing on supporting third-party developers. “While we’re proud of the world-class work from Oculus Studios over the years, among 1P and 3P apps, 86% of the effective time people spend in their VR headsets is with third-party apps.”

But Meta is still planning to make VR hardware; “we have a robust roadmap of future VR headsets that will be tailored to different audience segments as the market grows and matures,” according to Ryan. (That new hardware, which could include a new mainline Quest headset, might cost a higher price.)

Meta CTO Andrew Bosworth made similar comments about Meta’s shift in strategy in a recent episode of the Access podcast, which is hosted by former Verge staffer Alex Heath.

After the not-so-successful bet on the metaverse, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg now sees AI as the new social media, a vision that could include AI-generated games that users can share with others on their feeds. “There are 3D versions of that, and there are 2D versions of that and Horizon, I think, fits very well with the kind of immersive 3D version of that,” Zuckerberg said on the company’s latest earnings call.

A professor of biomechanics, Wakefield-Scurr thought she could do a little research and find a science-backed option. Two decades later, she’s still looking. Wakefield-Scurr now leads an 18-person team at the Research Group in Breast Health at the University of Portsmouth in the UK. Their research shows that the most effective high-impact-sports bras have underwires, padded cups, adjustable underbands and shoulder straps, and hook-and-eye closures. These bras reduce breast movement by up to 74% when compared with wearing no bra. But movement might not be the only metric that matters.

Few anatomical structures hang outside of the body unsupported by cartilage, muscle, or bone—meaning there wasn’t much historical research to build on. Wakefield-Scurr’s lab was the first to find that when women run, the motion of the torso causes breasts to move in a three-dimensional pattern—swinging side to side and up and down—as well as moving forward and backward. In an hour of slow jogging, boobs can bounce approximately 10,000 times.

Wearing a bra that’s too tight can limit breathing. Wearing one that’s too loose can create back, shoulder, and neck pain. Pain can also be caused by the lag between torso and breast movement, which causes what is scientifically known as “breast slap.”

The lab’s research has also found that the physical discomfort of bad bras, combined with the embarrassment of flopping around, is the one of the biggest barriers to exercise for women and that if women have a good sports bra, they’re more willing to go for a run.

Some bras function by deliberately compressing breasts. Others encapsulate and support each individual breast. But scientists still don’t know whether it’s more biomechanically important to reduce the breasts’ motion entirely, to reduce the speed at which they move, or to reduce breast slap. Will women constantly be forced to choose between the comfort of a stretchier bra and the support of a more restrictive one?

Wakefield-Scurr is excited about new materials she’s tested that tighten or stretch depending on how you move. She’s working with fabric manufacturers and clothing companies to try out their wares.

As more women take up high-impact sports, the need to understand what makes a good bra grows. Wakefield-Scurr says her lab can’t keep up with demand. Their cups runneth over.

Here are our picks for the advances to watch in the years ahead—and why we think they matter right now.

Speaking with popular AI content creators convinces me that “slop” isn’t just the internet rotting in real time, but the early draft of a new kind of pop culture.

I asked my MIT class to consider why some of the advances that MIT Technology Review’s journalists thought would change our world never really did—and what we can learn from the flops.

This year, hype around AI really exploded, and so did concerns about AI’s environmental footprint. We also saw some surprising biotech developments.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The bird is a beautiful silver-gray, and as she dies twitching in the lasernet I’m grateful for two things: First, that she didn’t make a sound. Second, that this will be the very last time.

They’re called corpse doves—because the darkest part of their gray plumage surrounds the lighter part, giving the impression that skeleton faces are peeking out from behind trash cans and bushes—and their crime is having the ability to carry diseases that would be compatible with humans. I open my hand, triggering the display from my imprinted handheld, and record an image to verify the elimination. A ding from my palm lets me know I’ve reached my quota for the day and, with that, the year.

I’m tempted to give this one a send-off, a real burial with holy words and some flowers, but then I hear a pack of streetrats hooting beside me. My city-issued vest is reflective and nanopainted so it projects a slight glow. I don’t know if it’s to keep us safe like they say, or if it’s just that so many of us are ex-cons working court-ordered labor, and civilians want to be able to keep an eye on us. Either way, everyone treats us like we’re invisible—everyone except children.

I switch the lasernet on the bird from electrocute to incinerate and watch as what already looked like a corpse becomes ashes.

“Executioner” is not my official title. The branch of city government we work for is called the Department of Mercy, and we’re only ever called technicians. But that doesn’t matter to the child, who can’t be more than eight but has the authority of a judge as she holds up a finger to point me out to her friends.

“Guys, look!” she says, then turns her attention to me. “You hunting something big?”

I shake my head, slowly packing up my things.

“Something small?” she asks. Then her eyes darken. “You’re not a cat killer, are you?”

I don’t know why I lied, but as the suspicion leaves her face and a smile returns, I’m glad I did.

“You should come down by the docks. We’ve got flies! Make your quota in a day.”

The girl tosses her hair, making the tinfoil charms she’s wrapped around her braids tinkle like wind chimes.

“It’s my last day. But if I get flies again for next year, I’ll swing by.”

Another lie, because we both know the city would never send anyone to the docks for flies. Flies are killed because they are a nuisance, which means people only care about clearing them out of suburbs and financial districts. They’d only send a tech down to the docks to kill something that put the city proper at risk through disease, or by using up more resources than they wanted to spare.

LeeLee is expecting me home to sit through the reassignments with her and it’s already late, so I hand out a couple of the combination warming and light sticks I get for winter to the pack of children with nowhere to go. As I walk away, the children are laughing so loud it sounds like screaming. They toss the sticks in the air like signal flares, small bright cries for help that no one will see.

LeeLee’s anxiety takes the form of caretaking, and as soon as I’ve stepped through the door I can smell bread warming and soup on the stove. I take off my muffling boots. Another day, I’d leave them on and sneak up on her just to be irritating, and she’d turn and threaten me with whatever kitchen utensil was at hand. But she’ll be extra nervous today, so I remove the shoes that let me catch nervous birds, and step hard on my way in.

Sometimes it seems impossible that I can spend a year killing every fragile and defenseless thing I’ve encountered but still take such care with Lee. But I tell myself that the killing isn’t me—it’s just my sentence, and what I do when I have a choice is the only thing that really says anything about me. For the first six months and 400 birds, I believed it.

LeeLee flicks on a smile that lasts a whole three seconds when she sees me, then clouds over again.

“Soup’s too thin. There wasn’t enough powder for a real broth.”

“Not like this. It doesn’t even cover up the taste of the water.”

“I like the taste of the water,” I say, which breaks her out of her spiraling enough to roll her eyes.

I put my hands on her shoulder to stop her fussing.

“The soup is going to be fine,” I say. “So will the reassignment.”

I’m not much taller than she is, but when we met in juvie she hadn’t hit her last growth spurt yet, so she still tilts her head back to look me in the eyes. “What if it’s not?”

“What if you get whatever assignment Jordan got?”

There it is. Because two of us didn’t leave juvie together to start community service—three of us did. But Jordan didn’t last three weeks into his assignment before he turned his implements inward.

I notice she doesn’t say What if  I get what Jordan got? Because LeeLee is more afraid of being left alone than of having to kill something innocent.

“We don’t know what his assignment was,” I say.

It’s true, but we do know it was bad. Two weeks into our first stretch, a drug meant to sterilize the city’s feral cat population accidentally had the opposite effect. Everyone was pulled off their assigned duty for three days to murder litters of new kittens instead. It nearly broke me and Lee, but Jordan seemed almost grateful.

“Besides, we don’t know if his assignment had anything to do with … what he did. You’re borrowing trouble. Worry in”—I check my palm—“an hour, when you actually know there’s something to worry about.”

You’d think it would hover over us too insistently to be ignored, but after we sit down and talk about our day I’m at ease, basking in the warmth of her storytelling and the bread that’s more beige than gray today. When the notification comes in, I am well and truly happy, and I can only hope it isn’t for the last time.

We both stiffen when we hear the alert. She looks at me, and I give her a smile and a nod, and then we look down. In the time between hearing the notification and checking it, I imagine all kinds of horrors that could be in my assignment slot. I imagine a picture of kittens, reason enough for the girl I met earlier to condemn me. For a moment, just a flash, I imagine looking down and seeing my own face as my target, or LeeLee’s.

But when I finally see the file, the relief that comes over me softens my spine. It’s a plant. Faceless, and bloodless.

I look up, and LeeLee’s eyes are dark as she leans forward, studying my face, looking for whatever crack she failed to see in Jordan. I force myself to smile wide for her.

She reaches forward and squeezes my hands. Hers are shaking.

She waves away my question. “I got rats. I can handle it. I was just worried about you.”

I spend the rest of the night unbelievably happy. For the next year, I get to kill a thing that does not scream.

“You get all that?” the man behind the desk asks, and I nod even though I didn’t.

I’ve traded in my boots and lasernet for a hazmat suit and a handheld mister with two different solutions. The man had been talking to me about how to use the solutions, but I can’t process verbal information very well. The whole reason I was sent to the correctional facility as a teen was that too many teachers mistook my processing delays for behavioral infractions. I’m planning to read the manual on my own time before I start in a few hours, but when I pick up the mister and look down the barrel, the equipment guy freaks out.

“They were supposed to add sulfur to this batch, but they didn’t. So you won’t smell it. It won’t make you cough or your eyes water. It’ll just be lights out. Good night. You got me?”

“Did you not hear me? Don’t even look at that thing without your mask on.” He takes a breath, calmer now that I’ve lowered my hands. “Look, the first solution—it’s fine. It’s keyed to the plant itself and just opens its cells up for whatever solution we put on it. You could drink the stuff. But that second? The orange vial? Don’t even put it in the mister without your mask on. It dissipates quickly, so you’re good once you’re done spraying, but not a second before.”

He looks around, then leans in. “They were supposed to add sulfur to this batch, but they didn’t. So you won’t smell it. It won’t make you cough or your eyes water. It’ll just be lights out. Good night. You got me?”

I nod again as I grab the mask I hadn’t noticed before. This time when I thank him, I mean it.

It takes me an hour to find the first plant, and when I do it’s beautiful. Lush pink on the inside and dark green on the outside, it looks hearty and primitive. Almost Jurassic. I can see why it’s only in the sewers now: it would be too easy to spot and destroy aboveground in the sea of concrete.

After putting on my mask, I activate the mister and then stand back as it sprays the plant with poison. Nothing happens. I remember the prepping solution and switch the cartridges to coat it in that first. The next time I try the poison, the plant wilts instantly, browning and shrinking like a tire deflating. I was wrong. Plants this size don’t die silently. It makes a wheezing sound, a deep sigh. By the third time I’ve heard it, I swear I can make out the word Please.

When I get home, LeeLee’s locked herself in the bathroom, which doesn’t surprise me. I heard that they moved to acid for rats, and the smell of a corpse dissolving is impossible to get used to and even harder to get out of your hair. I eat dinner, read, change for bed, and she’s still in the bathroom. I brush my teeth in the kitchen.

The next morning, I have to take a transport to the plant’s habitat on the other end of the city, so I spend the time looking through the file that came with the assignment. Under “Characteristics,” some city government scientist has written, “Large, dark. Resource-intensive. Stubborn.”

I stare at the last word. Its own sentence, tacked on like an afterthought. Stubborn. The same word that was written in my file when I got sent from school to the facility where I met LeeLee and Jordan. Large, dark, stubborn, and condemned. I’ve never been called resource-intensive. But I have been called a waste.

When I get to my last plant of the day, I don’t reach for the mister. This one is small, young, the green still neon-bright and the teeth at the edges still soft. I pick it up, careful with its roots, and carry it home. I find a discarded water container along the way and place it inside. When I get home I knock on LeeLee’s door. She doesn’t answer, so I leave the plant on the floor as an offering. They aren’t proper flowers, but they smell nice and earthy. It might keep the residual odor from melted organs, fur, and bones from taking over her room.

“Killing things is a dumb job,” says the girl.

After a week of hearing the death cries of its cousins, I was moved to use some of my allowance to buy cheap fertilizer and growth serum for my plant. The girl and her friends, fewer than before, were panhandling at the megastore across the way. She ran over, braids jingling, as soon as she saw me. I thought she’d leave once I gave her more glowsticks for her friends, but she stayed in step and kept following me.

“It’s not a dumb job,” I say, even though it is.

I shift my bag to point at the bottom of my vest. Beneath “Mercy Dept.” the department’s slogan is written in cursive: Killing to Save!

She sees the text but doesn’t register it, and I have to remind myself that even getting kicked out of school is a privilege. The city had decided to stop wasting educational resources on me. They’d never even tried with her or the other streetrats.

Suddenly, all I can think about is Jordan. “Maybe they don’t mind.”

I think of the plants. Maybe they hadn’t been pleading. Maybe they’d been sighing with relief. I think of the birds that eventually stopped running away.

“Maybe they’re tired. The city’s right, and their existence isn’t compatible with the world we made. And that’s our fault for being stupid and cruel, but it makes their lives so hard. We’ve made it so they can only live half a life. Maybe the least we can do is finish the job.”

It’s a terrible thing to say—even worse to a kid.

Her eyes go hard. “What are you killing now, executioner?”

The question surprises me. “Sewer plants. Why?”

I’d wanted her to leave me alone, but when she runs away I feel suddenly empty.

I have an issue at work when I can’t find my poison vial. I tell them it rolled away in the sewer and I couldn’t catch it in time, because I don’t want to tell them I was unobservant enough to let a street kid steal from me. After a stern warning and a mountain of forms, they issue a new vial and don’t add to my service time.

Pulling overtime to make up for the day I didn’t have my poison means it’s days before I get to fertilize my houseplant. LeeLee’s door is open, so I bring in the fertilizer and serum. She’s put the plant on her windowsill, but it prefers indirect sunlight, so I move it to the shelf next to her boxes of knickknacks and trinkets. I add the fertilizer to its soil and am about to spray it with the growth serum when I get an idea. I get the mister from my kit and set it up to spray the prepping solution on the little plant to prime it. I open the window and put on my mask, just in case, but I’m sure the man was telling the truth when he called the first liquid harmless. After its cells are open, I spray it with my store-bought growth serum.

I’m halfway through making dinner when I hear the crash and run into LeeLee’s room.

The plant has grown huge, turning adult instantly, and its new weight has taken down LeeLee’s shelf. Dainty keepsake boxes are shattered on our concrete floor.

I bend to my knees quickly, so focused on fixing my mistake that I don’t register the oddness of the items I’m picking up—jacks, kids’ toys, a bow—until my fingers touch something small and shimmering. It’s a scrap of silver, still rounded in the shape of the braids it was taken from.

I’d forgotten the city has more than one kind.

I’m waiting up when Lee gets home. I don’t make her tell me. I just grab her kit and rummage through it. Where my kit has a hazmat suit, hers has a stealth mesh to render her invisible. Where I keep my mister, she has a gun loaded with vials too large for rats. I have a mini-vac to suck up excess plant matter to prevent seeds from sprouting. She has zip ties.

By the time I’m done, she’s already cracking under the weight of everything she tried to protect me from. Within moments she’s sobbing on the floor. I carry her to her bed and get in beside her. I try not to listen too closely as she recounts every horrible moment, but I’m listening at the end, when she tells me she can’t do it anymore. When she confesses that she’s the one who stole my poison, and has only been waiting to take it because she didn’t have the stomach to do to me what Jordan did to us.

I tell her how we’ll make playgrounds of dead data centers and use hoses to fill the holes where skyscrapers were, and kids will play Marco Polo swimming over a CEO’s sunken office.

I leave her for just a moment, but by the time I lie back in bed beside her I’ve figured it out.

I tell her that she won’t have to take her shift tomorrow. I tell her I’m going to go around the city with my mister and my growth serum. That I’ll move plants from sewers to the yards around City Hall and every public space and the support pylons of important people’s companies, and then spray them so they become huge. The city will freak. I tell her it will be like the kittens, but this time we’ll all be pulled off our assignments to kill plants. And maybe the serum will work too well. Maybe the city was right to fear these plants, and they will grow and grow and eat our concrete while the roots crack our foundations and cut our electricity and everything will crumble. And the people with something to lose might suffer, but the rest of us will just laugh at the perfection of rubble. I tell her how we’ll make playgrounds of dead data centers and use hoses to fill the holes where skyscrapers were, and kids will play Marco Polo swimming over a CEO’s sunken office.

She asks if I’ll put any at our old detention center.

I talk long enough that her eyes close, and loud enough that neither of us can hear the sound of my mister blowing. The man who gave it to me was right. Even without the mask, it doesn’t smell like sulfur. It doesn’t smell like anything.

            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2026/02/20/1133365/measles-cases-rising-vaccine-preventable-infections-mumps-hepatitis-b/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">There’s a measles outbreak happening close to where I live. Since the start of this year, 34 cases have been confirmed in Enfield, a northern borough of London. Most of those affected are children under the age of 11. One in five have needed hospital treatment.

It’s another worrying development for an incredibly contagious and potentially fatal disease. Since October last year, 962 cases of measles have been confirmed in South Carolina. Large outbreaks (with more than 50 confirmed cases) are underway in four US states. Smaller outbreaks are being reported in another 12 states.

The vast majority of these cases have been children who were not fully vaccinated. Vaccine hesitancy is thought to be a significant reason children are missing out on important vaccines—the World Health Organization described it as one of the 10 leading threats to global health in 2019. And if we’re seeing more measles cases now, we might expect to soon see more cases of other vaccine-preventable infections, including some that can cause liver cancer or meningitis.

Some people will always argue that measles is not a big deal—that infections used to be common, and most people survived them and did just fine. It is true that in most cases kids do recover well from the virus. But not always.

Measles symptoms tend to start with a fever and a runny nose. The telltale rash comes later. In some cases, severe complications develop. They can include pneumonia, blindness, and inflammation of the brain. Some people won’t develop complications until years later. In rare cases, the disease can be fatal.

Before the measles vaccine was introduced, in 1963, measles epidemics occurred every two to three years, according to the WHO. Back then, around 2.6 million people died from measles every year. Since it was introduced, the measles vaccine is thought to have prevented almost 59 million deaths.

But vaccination rates have been lagging, says Anne Zink, an emergency medicine physician and clinical fellow at the Yale School of Public Health. “We’ve seen a slow decline in people who are willing to get vaccinated against measles for some time,” she says. “As we get more and more people who are at risk because they’re unvaccinated, the higher the chances that the disease can then spread and take off.”

Vaccination rates need to be at 95% to prevent measles outbreaks. But rates are well below that level in some regions. Across South Carolina, the proportion of kindergartners who received both doses of the MMR vaccine, which protects against measles as well as mumps and rubella, has dropped steadily over the last five years, from 94% in 2020-2021 to 91% in 2024-2025. Some schools in the state have coverage rates as low as 20%, state epidemiologist Linda Bell told reporters last month.

Vaccination rates are low in London, too. Fewer than 70% of children have received both doses of their MMR by the time they turn five, according to the UK Health Security Agency. In some boroughs, vaccination rates are as low as 58%. So perhaps it’s not surprising we’re seeing outbreaks.

The UK is one of six countries to have lost their measles elimination status last month, along with Spain, Austria, Armenia, Azerbaijan, and Uzbekistan. Canada lost its elimination status last year.

The highly contagious measles could be a bellwether for other vaccine-preventable diseases. Zink is already seeing signs. She points to a case of polio that paralyzed a man in New York in 2022. That happened when rates of polio vaccination were low, she says. “Polio is a great example of … a disease that is primarily asymptomatic, and most people don’t have any symptoms whatsoever, but for the people who do get symptoms, it can be life-threatening.”

Then there’s mumps—another disease the MMR vaccine protects against. It’s another one of those infections that can be symptom-free and harmless in some, especially children, but nasty for others. It can cause a painful swelling of the testes, and other complications include brain swelling and deafness. (From my personal experience of being hospitalized with mumps, I can attest that even “mild” infections are pretty horrible.)

Mumps is less contagious than measles, so we might expect a delay between an uptick in measles cases and the spread of mumps, says Zink. But she says that she’s more concerned about hepatitis B.

“It lives on surfaces for a long period of time, and if you’re not vaccinated against it and you’re exposed to it as a kid, you’re at a really high risk of developing liver cancer and death,” she says.

Zink was formerly chief medical officer of Alaska, a state that in the 1970s had the world’s highest rate of childhood liver cancer caused by hepatitis B. Screening and universal newborn vaccination programs eliminated the virus’s spread.

Public health experts worry that the current US administration’s position on vaccines may contribute to the decline in vaccine uptake. Last month the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention approved changes to childhood vaccination recommendations. The agency no longer recommends the hepatitis B vaccine for all newborns. The chair of the CDC’s vaccine advisory panel has also questioned broad vaccine recommendations for polio.

Even vitamin injections are being refused by parents, says Zink. A shot of vitamin K at birth can help prevent severe bleeding in some babies. But recent research suggests that parents of 5% of newborns are refusing it (up from 2.9% in 2017).

“I can’t tell you how many of my pediatric [doctor] friends have told me about having to care for a kiddo in the ICU with … bleeding into their brain because the kid didn’t get vitamin K at birth,” says Zink. “And that can kill kids, [or have] lifelong, devastating, stroke-like symptoms.”

All this paints a pretty bleak picture for children’s health. But things can change. Vaccination can still offer protection to plenty of people at risk of infection. South Carolina’s Department of Public Health is offering free MMR vaccinations to residents at mobile clinics.

“It’s easy to think ‘It’s not going to be me,’” says Zink. “Seeing kiddos who don’t have the agency to make decisions [about vaccination] being so sick from vaccine-preventable diseases, to me, is one of the most challenging things of practicing medicine.”

            <div id="article-text">AI-enabled deception now permeates our online lives. There are the high-profile cases you may easily spot, like when White House officials recently shared a manipulated image of a protester in Minnesota and then mocked those asking about it. Other times, it slips quietly into social media feeds and racks up views, like the videos that Russian influence campaigns are currently spreading to discourage Ukrainians from enlisting.

It is into this mess that Microsoft has put forward a blueprint, shared with MIT Technology Review, for how to prove what’s real online.

An AI safety research team at the company recently evaluated how methods for documenting digital manipulation are faring against today’s most worrying AI developments, like interactive deepfakes and widely accessible hyperrealistic models. It then recommended technical standards that can be adopted by AI companies and social media platforms.

To understand the gold standard that Microsoft is pushing, imagine you have a Rembrandt painting and you are trying to document its authenticity. You might describe its provenance with a detailed manifest of where the painting came from and all the times it changed hands. You might apply a watermark that would be invisible to humans but readable by a machine. And you could digitally scan the painting and generate a mathematical signature, like a fingerprint, based on the brush strokes. If you showed the piece at a museum, a skeptical visitor could then examine these proofs to verify that it’s an original.

All of these methods are already being used to varying degrees in the effort to vet content online. Microsoft evaluated 60 different combinations of them, modeling how each setup would hold up under different failure scenarios—from metadata being stripped to content being slightly altered or deliberately manipulated. The team then mapped which combinations produce sound results that platforms can confidently show to people online, and which ones are so unreliable that they may cause more confusion than clarification.

The company’s chief scientific officer, Eric Horvitz, says the work was prompted by legislation—like California’s AI Transparency Act, which will take effect in August—and the speed at which AI has developed to combine video and voice with striking fidelity.

“You might call this self-regulation,” Horvitz told MIT Technology Review. But it’s clear he sees pursuing the work as boosting Microsoft’s image: “We’re also trying to be a selected, desired provider to people who want to know what’s going on in the world.”

Nevertheless, Horvitz declined to commit to Microsoft using its own recommendation across its platforms. The company sits at the center of a giant AI content ecosystem: It runs Copilot, which can generate images and text; it operates Azure, the cloud service through which customers can access OpenAI and other major AI models; it owns LinkedIn, one of the world’s largest professional platforms; and it holds a significant stake in OpenAI. But when asked about in-house implementation, Horvitz said in a statement, “Product groups and leaders across the company were involved in this study to inform product road maps and infrastructure, and our engineering teams are taking action on the report’s findings.”

It’s important to note that there are inherent limits to these tools; just as they would not tell you what your Rembrandt means, they are not built to determine if content is accurate or not. They only reveal if it has been manipulated. It’s a point that Horvitz says he has to make to lawmakers and others who are skeptical of Big Tech as an arbiter of fact.

“It’s not about making any decisions about what’s true and not true,” he said. “It’s about coming up with labels that just tell folks where stuff came from.”

Hany Farid, a professor at UC Berkeley who specializes in digital forensics but wasn’t involved in the Microsoft research, says that if the industry adopted the company’s blueprint, it would be meaningfully more difficult to deceive the public with manipulated content. Sophisticated individuals or governments can work to bypass such tools, he says, but the new standard could eliminate a significant portion of misleading material.

“I don’t think it solves the problem, but I think it takes a nice big chunk out of it,” he says.

Still, there are reasons to see Microsoft’s approach as an example of somewhat naïve techno-optimism. There is growing evidence that people are swayed by AI-generated content even when they know that it is false. And in a recent study of pro-Russian AI-generated videos about the war in Ukraine, comments pointing out that the videos were made with AI received far less engagement than comments treating them as genuine.

“Are there people who, no matter what you tell them, are going to believe what they believe?” Farid asks. “Yes.” But, he adds, “there are a vast majority of Americans and citizens around the world who I do think want to know the truth.”

That desire has not exactly led to urgent action from tech companies. Google started adding a watermark to content generated by its AI tools in 2023, which Farid says has been helpful in his investigations. Some platforms use C2PA, a provenance standard Microsoft helped launch in 2021. But the full suite of changes that Microsoft suggests, powerful as they are, might remain only suggestions if they threaten the business models of AI companies or social media platforms.

“If the Mark Zuckerbergs and the Elon Musks of the world think that putting ‘AI generated’ labels on something will reduce engagement, then of course they’re incentivized not to do it,” Farid says. Platforms like Meta and Google have already said they’d include labels for AI-generated content, but an audit conducted by Indicator last year found that only 30% of its test posts on Instagram, LinkedIn, Pinterest, TikTok, and YouTube were correctly labeled as AI-generated.

More forceful moves toward content verification might come from the many pieces of AI regulation pending around the world. The European Union’s AI Act, as well as proposed rules in India and elsewhere, would all compel AI companies to require some form of disclosure that a piece of content was generated with AI.

One priority from Microsoft is, unsurprisingly, to play a role in shaping these rules. The company waged a lobbying effort during the drafting of California’s AI Transparency Act, which Horvitz said made the legislation’s requirements on how tech companies must disclose AI-generated content “a bit more realistic.”

But another is a very real concern about what could happen if the rollout of such content-verification technology is done poorly. Lawmakers are demanding tools that can verify what’s real, but the tools are fragile. If labeling systems are rushed out, inconsistently applied, or frequently wrong, people could come to distrust them altogether, and the entire effort would backfire. That’s why the researchers argue that it may be better in some cases to show nothing at all than a verdict that could be wrong.

Inadequate tools could also create new avenues for what the researchers call sociotechnical attacks. Imagine that someone takes a real image of a fraught political event and uses an AI tool to change only an inconsequential share of pixels in the image. When it spreads online, it could be misleadingly classified by platforms as AI-manipulated. But combining provenance and watermark tools would mean platforms could clarify that the content was only partially AI generated, and point out where the changes were made.

California’s AI Transparency Act will be the first major test of these tools in the US, but enforcement could be challenged by President Trump’s executive order from late last year seeking to curtail state AI regulations that are “burdensome” to the industry. The administration has also generally taken a posture against efforts to curb disinformation, and last year, via DOGE, it canceled grants related to misinformation. And, of course, official government channels in the Trump administration have shared content manipulated with AI (MIT Technology Review reported that the Department of Homeland Security, for example, uses video generators from Google and Adobe to make content it shares with the public).

I asked Horvitz whether fake content from this source worries him as much as that coming from the rest of social media. He initially declined to comment, but then he said, “Governments have not been outside the sectors that have been behind various kinds of manipulative disinformation, and this is worldwide.”

Backlash against ICE is fueling a broader movement against AI companies’ ties to President Trump.

How uncrewed narco subs could transform the Colombian drug trade

For decades, handmade narco subs have been some of the cocaine trade’s most elusive and productive workhorses, ferrying multi-ton loads of illicit drugs from Colombian estuaries toward markets in North America and, increasingly, the rest of the world. Now off-the-shelf technology—Starlink terminals, plug-and-play nautical autopilots, high-resolution video cameras—may be advancing that cat-and-mouse game into a new phase.Uncrewed subs could move more cocaine over longer distances, and they wouldn’t put human smugglers at risk of capture. And law enforcement around the world is just beginning to grapple with what this means for the future. Read the full story.

Google DeepMind wants to know if chatbots are just virtue signaling

The news: Google DeepMind is calling for the moral behavior of large language models—such as what they do when called on to act as companions, therapists, medical advisors, and so on—to be scrutinized with the same kind of rigor as their ability to code or do math.

Why it matters: As LLMs improve, people are asking them to play more and more sensitive roles in their lives. Agents are starting to take actions on people’s behalf. LLMs may be able to influence human decision-making. And yet nobody knows how trustworthy this technology really is at such tasks. Read the full story.

The building legal case for global climate justice

The United States and the European Union grew into economic superpowers by committing climate atrocities. They have burned a wildly disproportionate share of the world’s oil and gas, planting carbon time bombs that will detonate first in the poorest, hottest parts of the globe.Morally, there’s an ironclad case that the countries or companies responsible for this mess should provide compensation. Legally, though, the case has been far harder to make. But now those tides might be turning. Read the full story.

            <p><strong>MIT Technology Review | 2026-02-19</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2026/02/19/1132619/uncrewed-narco-subs-transform-columbian-drug-trade/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">On a bright morning last April, a surveillance plane operated by the Colombian military spotted a 40-foot-long shark-like silhouette idling in the ocean just off Tayrona National Park. It was, unmistakably, a “narco sub,” a stealthy fiberglass vessel that sails with its hull almost entirely underwater, used by drug cartels to move cocaine north. The plane’s crew radioed it in, and eventually nearby coast guard boats got the order, routine but urgent: Intercept.

In Cartagena, about 150 miles from the action, Captain Jaime González Zamudio, commander of the regional coast guard group, sat down at his desk to watch what happened next. On his computer monitor, icons representing his patrol boats raced toward the sub’s coordinates as updates crackled over his radio from the crews at sea. This was all standard; Colombia is the world’s largest producer of cocaine, and its navy has been seizing narco subs for decades. And so the captain was pretty sure what the outcome would be. His crew would catch up to the sub, just a bit of it showing above the water’s surface. They’d bring it to heel, board it, and force open the hatch to find two, three, maybe four exhausted men suffocating in a mix of diesel fumes and humidity, and a cargo compartment holding several tons of cocaine.

The boats caught up to the sub. A crew boarded, forced open the hatch, and confirmed that the vessel was secure. But from that point on, things were different.

First, some unexpected details came over the radio: There was no cocaine on board. Neither was there a crew, nor a helm, nor even enough room for a person to lie down. Instead, inside the hull the crew found a fuel tank, an autopilot system and control electronics, and a remotely monitored security camera. González Zamudio’s crew started sending pictures back to Cartagena: Bolted to the hull was another camera, as well as two plastic rectangles, each about the size of a cookie sheet—antennas for connecting to Starlink satellite internet.

The authorities towed the boat back to Cartagena, where military techs took a closer look. Weeks later, they came to an unsettling conclusion: This was Colombia’s first confirmed uncrewed narco sub. It could be operated by remote control, but it was also capable of some degree of autonomous travel. The techs concluded that the sub was likely a prototype built by the Clan del Golfo, a powerful criminal group that operates along the Caribbean coast.

For decades, handmade narco subs have been some of the cocaine trade’s most elusive and productive workhorses, ferrying multi-ton loads of illicit drugs from Colombian estuaries toward markets in North America and, increasingly, the rest of the world. Now off-the-shelf technology—Starlink terminals, plug-and-play nautical autopilots, high-resolution video cameras—may be advancing that cat-and-mouse game into a new phase.

Uncrewed subs could move more cocaine over longer distances, and they wouldn’t put human smugglers at risk of capture. Law enforcement around the world is just beginning to grapple with what the Tayrona sub means for the future—whether it was merely an isolated experiment or the opening move in a new era of autonomous drug smuggling at sea.

Drug traffickers love the ocean. “You can move drug traffic through legal and illegal routes,” says Juan Pablo Serrano, a captain in the Colombian navy and head of the operational coordination center for Orión, a multiagency, multinational counternarcotics effort. The giant container ships at the heart of global commerce offer a favorite approach, Serrano says. Bribe a chain of dockworkers and inspectors, hide a load in one of thousands of cargo boxes, and put it on a totally legal commercial vessel headed to Europe or North America. That route is slow and expensive—involving months of transit and bribes spread across a wide network—but relatively low risk. “A ship can carry 5,000 containers. Good luck finding the right one,” he says.

Far less legal, but much faster and cheaper, are small, powerful motorboats. Quick to build and cheap to crew, these “go-fasts” top out at just under 50 feet long and can move smaller loads in hours rather than days. But they’re also easy for coastal radars and patrols to spot.

Submersibles—or, more accurately, “semisubmersibles”—fit somewhere in the middle. They take more money and engineering to build than an open speedboat, but they buy stealth—even if a bit of the vessel rides at the surface, the bulk stays hidden underwater. That adds another option to a portfolio that smugglers constantly rebalance across three variables: risk, time, and cost. When US and Colombian authorities tightened control over air routes and commercial shipping in the early 1990s, subs became more attractive. The first ones were crude wooden hulls with a fiberglass shell and extra fuel tanks, cobbled together in mangrove estuaries, hidden from prying eyes. Today’s fiberglass semisubmersible designs ride mostly below the surface, relying on diesel engines that can push multi-ton loads for days at a time while presenting little more than a ripple and a hot exhaust pipe to radar and infrared sensors.

A typical semisubmersible costs under $2 million to build and can carry three metric tons of cocaine. That’s worth over $160 million in Europe—wholesale.

Most ferry between South American coasts and handoff points in Central America and Mexico, where allied criminal organizations break up the cargo and slowly funnel it toward the US. But some now go much farther. In 2019, Spanish authorities intercepted a semisubmersible after a 27-day transatlantic voyage from Brazil. In 2024, police in the Solomon Islands found the first narco sub in the Asia-Pacific region, a semisubmersible probably originating from Colombia on its way to Australia or New Zealand.

If the variables are risk, time, and cost, then the economics of a narco sub are simple. Even if they spend more time on the water than a powerboat, they’re less likely to get caught—and a relative bargain to produce. A narco sub might cost between $1 million and $2 million to build, but a kilo of cocaine costs just about $500 to make. “By the time that kilo reaches Europe, it can sell for between $44,000 and $55,000,” Serrano says. A typical semisubmersible carries up to three metric tons—cargo worth well over $160 million at European wholesale prices.

Off-the-shelf nautical autopilots, WiFi antennas, Starlink satellite internet connections, and remote cameras are all drug smugglers need to turn semisubmersibles into drone ships.

As a result, narco subs are getting more common. Seizures by authorities tripled in the last 20 years, according to Colombia’s International Center for Research and Analysis Against Maritime Drug Trafficking (CMCON), and Serrano admits that the Orión alliance has enough ships and aircraft to catch only a fraction of what sails.

Until now, though, narco subs have had one major flaw: They depended on people, usually poor fishermen or low-level recruits sealed into stifling compartments for days at a time, steering by GPS and sight, hoping not to be spotted. That made the subs expensive and a risk to drug sellers if captured. Like good capitalists, the Tayrona boat’s builders seem to have been trying to obviate labor costs with automation. No crew means more room for drugs or fuel and no sailors to pay—or to get arrested or flip if a mission goes wrong.

“If you don’t have a person or people on board, that makes the transoceanic routes much more feasible,” says Henry Shuldiner, a researcher at InSight Crime who has analyzed hundreds of narco-sub cases. It’s one thing, he notes, to persuade someone to spend a day or two going from Colombia to Panama for a big payout; it’s another to ask four people to spend three weeks sealed inside a cramped tube, sleeping, eating, and relieving themselves in the same space. “That’s a hard sell,” Shuldiner says.

An uncrewed sub doesn’t have to race to a rendezvous because its crew can endure only a few days inside. It can move more slowly and stealthily. It can wait out patrols or bad weather, loiter near a meeting point, or take longer and less well-monitored routes. And if something goes wrong—if a military plane appears or navigation fails—its owners can simply scuttle the vessel from afar.

Meanwhile, the basic technology to make all that work is getting more and more affordable, and the potential profit margins are rising. “The rapidly approaching universality of autonomous technology could be a nightmare for the U.S. Coast Guard,” wrote two Coast Guard officers in the US Naval Institute’s journal Proceedings in 2021. And as if to prove how good an idea drone narco subs are, the US Marine Corps and the weapons builder Leidos are testing a low-profile uncrewed vessel called the Sea Specter, which they describe as being “inspired” by narco-sub design.

The possibility that drug smugglers are experimenting with autonomous subs isn’t just theoretical. Law enforcement agencies on other smuggling routes have found signs the Tayrona sub isn’t an isolated case. In 2022, Spanish police seized three small submersible drones near Cádiz, on Spain’s southern coast. Two years later, Italian authorities confiscated a remote-­controlled minisubmarine they believed was intended for drug runs. “The probability of expansion is high,” says Diego Cánovas, a port and maritime security expert in Spain. Tayrona, the biggest and most technologically advanced uncrewed narco sub found so far, is more likely a preview than an anomaly.

Today, the Tayrona semisubmersible sits on a strip of grass at the ARC Bolívar naval base in Cartagena. It’s exposed to the elements; rain has streaked its paint. To one side lies an older, bulkier narco sub seized a decade ago, a blue cylinder with a clumsy profile. The Tayrona’s hull looks lower, leaner, and more refined.

Up close, it is also unmistakably handmade. The hull is a dull gray-blue, the fiberglass rough in places, with scrapes and dents from the tow that brought it into port. It has no identifying marks on the exterior—nothing that would tie it to a country, a company, or a port. On the upper surface sit the two Starlink antennas, painted over in the same gray-blue to keep them from standing out against the sea.

I climb up a ladder and drop through the small hatch near the stern. Inside, the air is damp and close, the walls beaded with condensation. Small puddles of fuel have collected in the bilge. The vessel has no seating, no helm or steering wheel, and not enough space to stand up straight or lie down. It’s clear it was never meant to carry people. A technical report by CMCON found that the sub would have enough fuel for a journey of some 800 nautical miles, and the central cargo bay would hold between 1 and 1.5 tons of cocaine.

At the aft end, the machinery compartment is a tangle of hardware: diesel engine, batteries, pumps, and a chaotic bundle of cables feeding an electronics rack. All the core components are still there. Inside that rack, investigators identified a NAC-3 autopilot processor, a commercial unit designed to steer midsize boats by tying into standard hydraulic pumps, heading sensors, and rudder-­feedback systems. They cost about $2,200 on Amazon.

“These are plug-and-play technologies,” says Wilmar Martínez, a mechatronics professor at the University of America in Bogotá, when I show him pictures of the inside of the sub. “Midcareer mechatronics students could install them.”

For all its advantages, an autonomous drug-smuggling submarine wouldn’t be invincible. Even without a crew on board, there are still people in the chain. Every satellite internet terminal—Starlink or not—comes with a billing address, a payment method, and a log of where and when it pings the constellation. Colombian officers have begun to talk about negotiating formal agreements with providers, asking them to alert authorities when a transceiver’s movements match known smuggling patterns. Brazil’s government has already cut a deal with Starlink to curb criminal use of its service in the Amazon.

The basic playbook for finding a drone sub will look much like the one for crewed semisubmersibles. Aircraft and ships will use radar to pick out small anomalies and infrared cameras to look for the heat of a diesel engine or the turbulence of a wake. That said, it might not work. “If they wind up being smaller, they’re going to be darn near impossible to detect,” says Michael Knickerbocker, a former US Navy officer who advises defense tech firms.

Autonomous drug subs are “a great example of how resilient cocaine traffickers are, and how they’re continuously one step ahead of authorities,” says one researcher.

Even worse, navies already act on only a fraction of their intelligence leads because they don’t have enough ships and aircraft. The answer, Knickerbocker argues, is “robot on robot.” Navies and coast guards will need swarms of their own small, relatively cheap uncrewed systems—surface vessels, underwater gliders, and long-endurance aerial vehicles that can loiter, sense, and relay data back to human operators. Those experiments have already begun. The US 4th Fleet, which covers Latin America and the Caribbean, is experimenting with uncrewed platforms in counternarcotics patrols. Across the Atlantic, the European Union’s European Maritime Safety Agency operates drones for maritime surveillance.

Today, though, the major screens against oceangoing vessels of all kinds are coastal radar networks. Spain operates SIVE to watch over choke points like the Strait of Gibraltar, and in the Pacific, Australia’s over-the-horizon radar network, JORN, can spot objects hundreds of miles away, far beyond the range of conventional radar.

Even so, it’s not enough to just spot an uncrewed narco sub. Law enforcement also has to stop it—and that will be tricky.

With a crewed vessel, Colombian doctrine says coast guard units should try to hail the boat first with lights, sirens, radio calls, and warning shots. If that fails, interceptor crews sometimes have to jump aboard and force the hatch. Officers worry that future autonomous craft could be wired to sink or even explode if someone gets too close. “If they get destroyed, we may lose the evidence,” says Víctor González Badrán, a navy captain and director of CMCON. “That means no seizure and no legal proceedings against that organization.”

That’s where electronic warfare enters the picture—radio-frequency jamming, cyber tools, perhaps more exotic options. In the simplest version, jamming means flooding the receiver with noise so that commands from the operator never reach the vessel. Spoofing goes a step further, feeding fake signals so that the sub thinks it’s somewhere else or obediently follows a fake set of waypoints. Cyber tools might aim higher up the chain, trying to penetrate the software that runs the vessel or the networks it uses to talk to satellite constellations. At the cutting edge of these countermeasures are electromagnetic pulses designed to fry electronics outright, turning a million-dollar narco sub into a dead hull drifting at sea.

In reality, the tools that might catch a future Tayrona sub are unevenly distributed, politically sensitive, and often experimental. Powerful cyber or electromagnetic tricks are closely guarded secrets; using them in a drug case risks exposing capabilities that militaries would rather reserve for wars. Systems like Australia’s JORN radar are tightly held national security assets, their exact performance specs classified, and sharing raw data with countries on the front lines of the cocaine trade would inevitably mean revealing hints as to how they got it. “Just because a capability exists doesn’t mean you employ it,” Knickerbocker says.

Analysts don’t think uncrewed narco subs will reshape the global drug trade, despite the technological leap. Trafficking organizations will still hedge their bets across those three variables, hiding cocaine in shipping containers, dissolving it into liquids and paints, racing it north in fast boats. “I don’t think this is revolutionary,” Shuldiner says. “But it’s a great example of how resilient cocaine traffickers are, and how they’re continuously one step ahead of authorities.”

There’s still that chance, though, that everything international law enforcement agencies know about drug smuggling is about to change. González Zamudio says he keeps getting requests from foreign navies, coast guards, and security agencies to come see the Tayrona sub. He greets their delegations, takes them out to the strip of grass on the base, and walks them around it, gives them tours. It has become a kind of pilgrimage. Everyone who makes it worries that the next time a narco sub appears near a distant coastline, they’ll board it as usual, force the hatch—and find it full of cocaine and gadgets, but without a single human occupant. And no one knows what happens after that.

            <h2>Gartner $110M sale of Digital Markets division in latest SEC filing</h2>
            <p><strong>The Next Web | 2026-02-20</strong></p>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">When Gartner first disclosed that it had agreed to part with its Digital Markets ( business unit that included its major software review, specifically Capterra, GetApp, and Software Advice) business in early 2026, the announcement was forward-looking and economical with detail: it named the buyer and the assets involved, but it left out any financial terms.

That lack of financial detail naturally made people wonder exactly how much the transaction was worth.

It was only later, in the company’s audited annual report on Form 10-K, filed on February 12, 2026, that a clearer picture of how the transaction was treated in the company’s regulatory filings became visible. That document, which is public, notes that the sale was completed on February 5, 2026, placing the divestiture within the broader contours of Gartner’s financial disclosures.

This most recent filing, accession number 0000749251-26-000112, stands in stark contrast with Gartner’s prior 10-K, covering the year ended December 31, 2024, and filed on February 13, 2025, under accession 0000749251-25-000008.

In that earlier report, there is no reference to this transaction or to any figure associated with it, consistent with the fact that the deal was not agreed or closed until 2026.

The January 29, 2026 announcement publicly identified G2 as the buyer, and specified the assets involved: Capterra, Software Advice, and GetApp, but it did not disclose any financial terms, a detail that was equally absent from contemporaneous coverage.

In Gartner’s 10-K, the recorded consideration is described as being “before customary purchase price adjustments,” a phrase that signals the number reported in the filing is an initial headline value that may change once post-closing reconciliations tied to balance sheet items are completed.

These adjustments are common in sales agreements and are meant to align the agreed price with the business’s actual financial situation at closing.

A related 8-K filed on February 3, 2026, which included an earnings release, did not include any price details about the sale.

When we looked for the earliest relevant documents, we found that an earlier annual report,  Form 10-K filed on February 13, 2025 (accession 0000749251-25-000008), covers Gartner’s results through the end of 2024 and makes no reference to Digital Markets or the brands that were later sold.

That absence simply reflects the timing: the deal was agreed and completed in 2026, so it could not have been reported in a document covering the prior year.

Thus, the first SEC filing in which the transaction clearly appears is Gartner’s 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2025, filed on February 12, 2026, under accession 0000749251-26-000112.

It is in this later annual report that Gartner formally records the sale of the business and constitutes the first document in the public record to show how the company accounted for the transaction in its audited disclosures.

Reading the February 12, 2026, 10-K, the Digital Markets sale shows up in several sections. Early in the document, in the business overview, Gartner notes that the sale was completed on February 5, 2026, alongside the headline figure that appears in the record.

Later in the same report, in a section discussing recent developments, the company lays out the context around the divestiture, reporting that Digital Markets was classified as “held for sale” as of December 31, 2025, and listing the related assets and liabilities on the balance sheet.

The same description of the sale is repeated once more in a note on subsequent events, which walks through the timeline from signing to closing.

Notably, none of these references in the annual report names the buyer. Within the text of the 10-K, a search reveals that “G2” and the individual brands that were part of the business being sold do not appear, underscoring that Gartner’s disclosure is focused on the transaction as a financial event rather than on the identity of the counterparty.

When a company states that a sale price is described as being “before customary purchase price adjustments,” it means the number reported is only a starting point.

In most deals, the buyer and seller agree on an initial figure but include mechanisms in the contract that can revise that figure after closing to reflect the business’s actual financial position at transfer of control.

These post-closing adjustments are designed to ensure a fair final amount based on what the business truly delivered at closing, rather than on estimates made when the agreement was signed.

The most common of these adjustments is tied to working capital, the cash and short-term assets a business needs to operate. Parties negotiate a target level; if the actual working capital at closing is higher than expected, the seller may receive more. If it’s lower, the buyer may pay less.

Other adjustments can relate to net cash or debt, where the purchase price is recalculated based on the actual cash and debt assumed by the buyer, and to mechanisms such as escrows or deferred payments that hold portions of the sale price until certain conditions are resolved.

Because Gartner’s public filing does not include the underlying sale agreement or a detailed reconciliation of these adjustment mechanisms, the exact formulas or thresholds that could change the final amount are not visible in the public record.

What the 10-K does make clear is that the figure reported is a headline number, subject to later review and revision once the closing accounts are finalized.

In many deals, the headline price is agreed on a “cash-free, debt-free” basis, meaning that after closing, the buyer and seller adjust the purchase price to reflect the target business’s actual cash and debt position.

If the business ends up with more debt or less cash than expected, the effective price the seller receives can be reduced. Conversely, if it has more cash or less debt than anticipated, it can increase the amount paid.

In Gartner’s public disclosures, there is no way to tell from the 10-K whether the Digital Markets sale was structured this way or how any such adjustment would be calculated because the underlying agreement and detailed terms are not part of the filings.

What the 10-K does show is the initial figure; whether and how it changes through these common adjustment mechanisms remains outside the public record.

Gartner’s most recent Form 10-K, filed on February 12, 2026, shows that the company completed the sale of its Digital Markets business on February 5, 2026, using language that describes the consideration as “approximately $110.0 million, before customary purchase price adjustments.” This is the only financial figure tied to the deal that appears in the public filings.

The earlier public announcement from January 29, in which G2 said it had agreed to buy Capterra, Software Advice, and GetApp from Gartner, did not include any financial terms, and subsequent media coverage similarly reported that price details were not disclosed at the time.

In filings, the phrase “purchase price adjustments” refers to standard mechanisms in sale agreements, often tied to working capital and other balance-sheet items, that can increase or decrease the final amount paid after closing.

Gartner’s 10-K does not name the buyer in the sale disclosure, but it confirms the closing date and the approximate consideration while noting that the figure could change through those adjustments.

Taken together, Gartner’s own regulatory filings tell a more complete story of the Digital Markets sale than the initial announcement did. The only financial detail available in the public record comes from the company’s 10-K, which notes the closing date and describes the consideration in broad terms, but it leaves several questions unanswered.

We also reached out to both sides for further comment and clarification ahead of publication, seeking confirmation of the figures, insight into the structure of the deal, and any context that might illuminate how the transaction was negotiated and reported.

By the time of publication, neither party had responded.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Google’s announcement that its Gemini app now writes music for you isn’t just one of those “blowing my mind” product updates. It feels like a symbolic surrender to a long-standing refrain from Big Tech: creative work is now just another checkbox for a machine.

If you don’t know what I am talking about, yesterday Google launched a new feature, Lyria 3, in the Gemini app, that allows us to cook up 30-second tracks complete with lyrics and cover art from a text prompt or a photo, of course, generated by Nano Banana; basically, no instruments, no experience, no pesky tactile skill required.

It’s essentially a LEGO set for “songs” that lasts about as long as a TikTok loop. They say it’s designed for YouTube Creators, and I tend to agree with them, because you can’t make to much with 30 seconds.

Still, the underlying problem is another one, as I am seeing different projects/songs made with AI, including AI artists. And this is what I want to highlight in this piece.

“Behind every beautiful thing, there’s some kind of pain, “ said Bob Dylan, and I could not agree more.

If we take a look at the history ( art, music, literature, poetry, and so on), the main fuel for creation was indeed pain.

Now, how should I put this? Probably the only pain that Lyria can feel is more like a faint server-overload alert than heartbreak.

Real songwriters know that soul isn’t born in a 30-second prompt, it’s extracted through years of mistakes, late nights, losses, and tiny revelations.

Call it a toy if you like. Google will, too.

They even watermark the outputs with a SynthID tag so the 30-second ditties are officially AI-generated, not “inspired.” That’s a nod to copyright concerns, but it also reads like an admission: these aren’t really art, they’re chemical by-products of pattern statistics.

What’s striking isn’t the novelty. Much of this has been possible in labs and APIs for years, and creators have been experimenting with generative music tools as collaborators.

What Lyria 3 does, and what makes this moment worth watching, is normalising the idea that anyone can “write” a song with a chatbot and a mood descriptor. That’s not empowerment; it’s a devaluation of craft.

Just because you pay a subscription to Suno, that’s another AI music generator, and that one is more complex, that doesn’t make you an artist or a singer. Just because you learn how to write a prompt for any LLM model and generates you pages, you are not a writer.

Imagine a world where every blog has AI-generated copy, not that we are not almost in the middle of this, and every company can churn out half-baked music for their ads or social posts.

In that economy, a professional songwriter’s unique skill becomes as optional as knowing how to use a metronome.

You could ask Gemini for an “emotional indie ballad about a lost sock,” and voilà, you have something. Whether it has actual coherence or soul is left to the listener to decide. It is fun to use it with your friends, shorts, to impress your date.

Still, Lyria 3’s music is capped at 30 seconds, and that’s no accident. It sidesteps deeper legal and ethical quarrels about training data and mimicry of existing works by keeping outputs short and legally fuzzy. That’s a thumbs up from me.

But even within that limit, it’s now possible for someone with no craft or cultural context to generate riffs, lyrics, and chord progressions that sound, to the casual ear, adequately musical. In an attention economy obsessed with shareability, “adequate” quickly becomes plenty.

This matters because real songs, the ones that endure, that carry human experience, aren’t just collections of musical atoms. They’re shaped by story, risk, cultural memory, and sometimes contradiction.

One of my favorite artists, Tom Waits, said, ”I don’t have a formal background. I learned from listening to records, from talking to people, from hanging around record stores, and hanging around musicians and saying, “Hey, how did you do that? Do that again. Let me see how you did that.”

This was the research and prompting before, and it’s not only about reducing time, or getting things faster, and “having more time for you.”

It’s about the entire process, the contact with other artists, humans, and IDEAS.

Those are qualities machines can mimic but not originate. When the machines own the first pass at creation, and the commercial ecosystem embraces that output because it is cheap and fast, the incentives shift. Not gradually. Suddenly.

The record industry is already grappling with AI. Streaming services, publishers, and even labels have begun experimenting with algorithmic playlists and automated composition.

What Gemini’s Lyria 3 does is extend that experiment to public perception. A whole generation may come to think that “making music” means typing a description and choosing a style. Songwriting becomes a UX problem, not a craft one.

That raises a serious question: in a world where AI can conjure up a half-decent hook on demand, what will distinguish professional artists?

If the answer is only brand story or marketing muscle, we aren’t celebrating creativity; we are monetising it out of existence.

Tech companies like Google will frame this as liberation. And in a literal sense, anyone who’s ever wanted to hear a short tune about a sock’s existential crisis now can. But liberation without value for the creator is just consumerism by another name.

Lyria 3 might be good for GIF soundtracks and social clips, and TikTok viral reels, but it doesn’t make professional musicians obsolete; it makes their work less necessary to the platforms that reward hyper-consumable content.

That’s a different threat from outright replacement: it’s obsolescence by trivialisation.

If AI is going to be part of musical creation, then let it be as an assistant to the composer,  someone who improves ideas, not replaces them. What we’re seeing with Gemini is not collaboration but outsourcing.

And the lesson for artists isn’t to fear the algorithm. It’s to insist on clarity about where AI replaces labour and where it augments human sensibility.

Because once the marketplace equates the two, the humans who do the work will be the ones left asking for royalties in a language no one else wants to speak.

And, as a personal recommendation, not sponsored, there are streaming platforms like Deezer that have built AI detection tools that flag and label AI-generated tracks, excluding them from recommendations and royalties so that human songwriters aren’t buried under synthetic spam, and consumers can make the difference between AI and human.

If you care about preserving real artistry in a world of text-to-tune generative models, start paying attention to how platforms handle AI-tagging and choose services that give you transparency about what you’re actually listening to.

Yet, I’m not here to throw shade at Lyria 3; if anything, the idea of letting people turn a photo or a mood into a short track sounds like fun for casual use and creative experimentation. It is what Google says it’s meant for.

Yet the reality is that as these models proliferate, we risk confusing novelty with art. And here, the big tech companies are not the ones to blame, but us.

            <div id="article-text">Plato, a Berlin-based startup, has raised $14.5 million in seed funding to bring generative AI into wholesale distribution, a massive industry that rarely makes tech headlines but quietly moves a significant share of the world’s goods.

The round was led by Atomico, with Cherry Ventures, Discovery Ventures, and D11Z joining in.

Wholesale distribution accounts for roughly one-fifth of global production flows. Yet much of it still runs on aging ERP systems, Excel spreadsheets, and manual quoting workflows that haven’t meaningfully evolved in years.

While AI has flooded marketing, customer support, and coding, distribution sales teams are often still copy-pasting numbers between systems.

Plato’s thesis is simple: instead of adding another dashboard, embed AI directly into the operational core. The company connects to existing ERP systems and turns historical sales data into automated actions, flagging revenue opportunities, generating quotes, and identifying risks before they surface in quarterly reports.

The idea grew out of lived frustration. Co-founder Benedikt Nolte experienced the inefficiencies firsthand in his family’s distribution business. Generic CRM tools, he concluded, weren’t designed for the complexity of distributor operations. Plato was built specifically for that environment, not retrofitted from SaaS templates designed for startups.

Early traction suggests the industry is paying attention. Plato reportedly works with several large distributors on six-figure contracts, a sign that AI adoption in traditional sectors is less about hype and more about whether it can save time and unlock revenue.

The fresh capital will help Plato expand beyond sales intelligence into areas like procurement and customer service automation, while pushing into new European markets and eventually the U.S.

More broadly, the round highlights a shift in AI investing. The next wave isn’t just about bigger language models; it’s about embedding intelligence into industries that haven’t been rewritten by software yet. Wholesale distribution may not be glamorous, but it is structurally essential. If AI can modernize that layer of the economy, the impact will be far larger than another chatbot demo.

            <div id="article-text">David Silver, a British AI researcher known for his role at Google’s DeepMind lab, has helped build some of the most influential AI systems and is now leading his own ambitious start-up. He is in the middle of raising a $1 billion seed round for his new London-based venture, Ineffable Intelligence.

If the fundraising will be completed, would be the largest seed round ever seen in Europe.

The round is being led by Sequoia Capital, with titans such as Nvidia, Google and Microsoft reportedly in talks to participate, according to industry sources familiar with the deal.

The proposed investment would place Ineffable Intelligence’s pre-money valuation at around $4 billion, an eye-watering figure for a company that hasn’t yet shipped a product.

David Silver’s name is synonymous with some of the most memorable milestones in AI. During more than a decade at Google DeepMind, he helped develop AlphaGo, the first AI to defeat a world champion at the ancient game of Go, and later AlphaStar, which bested professional players in StarCraft II.

His work has shaped how modern AI systems learn and make decisions.

In late 2025, David Silver left DeepMind, where he also contributed to the development of the Gemini family of large language models, to launch Ineffable Intelligence. .

In the current days billion-dollar seed rounds are no longer unheard of, but they remain exceptionally rare, especially in Europe.

If Sequoia and its partners follow through on their commitments, the round would serve as both a vote of confidence in David Silver’s vision and a broader signal that venture capitalists are increasingly willing to fund ambitious, research-driven AI ventures well before traditional product milestone

The sheer size of the potential round also reshapes the narrative around Europe’s role in the global AI race.

Historically, most of the industry’s capital and rich technical talent have gravitated to Silicon Valley and other U.S. hubs. A £737 million-plus round led by a top U.S. investor shows that world-class AI ideas can still attract world-class capital in Europe.

David Silver’s dual role – as an entrepreneur and as a professor at University College London,  hints at a blend of academic ambition and commercial pressure that may define the next era of AI innovation.

His thesis suggests that the path to genuinely powerful AI may not be simply scaling up models, but teaching systems to learn and improve through real-world experience, a direction he believes could outpace approaches grounded solely in data accumulated from human interactions.

Whether Ineffable Intelligence ultimately delivers on its lofty vision remains to be seen.

But the enthusiasm around its fundraising reflects a broader trend: AI is entering a phase where conviction in founders and ideas can translate directly into unprecedented capital flows.

For Europe, a successful $1 billion cap table would be a milestone moment, not just financially, but symbolically,  in positioning the continent as a contender for the future of AI research and deployment.

            <div id="article-text">If you tuned in to China’s 2026 CCTV Spring Festival Gala looking for traditional lion dances and nostalgic tunes, you may have done a double-take when what greeted you was a squad of humanoid robots performing kung fu, synchronized moves, and comedy sketches with more precision than most of us manage during family reunions.

It was not just spectacle; it was industrial policy with flair

This year’s gala, which is China’s equivalent of the Super Bowl meets cultural heritage broadcast, featured everything from high-speed martial arts sequences to choreographed routines done by humanoid robots from leading local makers like Unitree Robotics, Galbot, MagicLab and Noetix.

Watching them flip, strike poses, and dance isn’t just futuristic entertainment; it’s a deliberate signal about where Chinese tech wants to sit at the global table.

Just last year, robot appearances were charming but clunky: think awkward “dances” that needed human help to keep upright.

Instead, this year, they executed complex actions; backflips, martial arts inspired routines, even comedic timing that was surprisingly sharp for machines. C

lips of the robots went viral almost immediately, flooding social platforms and dominating international tech feeds.

Chinese state media and commentators have leaned into the moment as proof of rapid progress in humanoid robotics, placing it squarely within China’s “AI+manufacturing” industrial ambitions.

While some viewers showered praise on the displays, others grumbled that the new lineup made the gala feel more like CES Lite than a cosy celebration of culture, and yes, robots “stealing the Year of the Horse thunder” is now a real complaint.

The optics are unmistakable. China’s robotics sector, already responsible for a lion’s share of worldwide humanoid robot production, is eager to tell a simple story: we don’t just build hardware in factories, we animate it with AI brainsthat can perform with finesse.

Whether it’s a crowd-pleasing kung fu sequence or a scripted comedy routine, these robots have become ambassadors of technological prowess on very prime cultural real estate.

But let’s not overstate their practical chops just yet. Despite impressive stage routines, robotics experts point out that most current humanoids are still best at pre-programmed movements and lack true autonomous adaptability in unpredictable environments.

In other words, they’re amazing performers on cue, not yet ready to be your personal caregiver or industrial line worker without a lot more training and development.

Still, the spectacle accomplishes something important: it thrusts humanoid robots into the public imagination while signalling to investors, startups and rival nations that robot development is now prime time tech theatre, not just a research lab curiosity.

Whether you see this as a fun blend of culture and innovation or a high-stakes display of national tech strategy, China’s robotics presence at the gala is now part of a broader conversation about where AI embodied in hardware might go next.

It’s less about whether robots will “replace us” and more about how they’re being introduced into narratives that billions of people watch together, shaping perceptions and expectations about the future.

China’s robots danced their way into billions of screens this Lunar New Year, and they did it with style, precision, and a well-timed cultural wink.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">A Paris-based venture firm that has quietly shaped the quantum technology scenery is now making a much louder statement about Europe’s role in the future of computing, materials science, and sensing.

Quantonation Ventures has today announced the successful close of its second flagship fund at €220 million, more than double the size of its first vehicle and a clear signal that institutional capital is flowing into technologies grounded in physics, not just software.

Quantonation is not your typical venture capital firm. From its inception, it set out to invest in startups building real hardware and disruptive physics-based platforms, including quantum computing, sensing, communications, advanced materials, and what the industry calls “deep physics.”

The new Quantonation II fund attracted big names in institutional capital alongside strategic technology investors. Backers include the European Investment Fund, French public investor Bpifrance, Spanish construction and infrastructure group Grupo ACS, Denmark’s Novo Holdings, Japanese tech giant Toshiba, and Singapore-linked Vertex Holdings among others.

A workspace designed for growth, collaboration, and endless networking opportunities in the heart of tech.

This mix of public and private capital reflects broader confidence in the potential of physics-based technologies to move beyond the research lab and into tangible commercial impact.

Where early quantum investing often centered on proof-of-concept breakthroughs, Quantonation’s strategy now emphasizes industrialization, scale, and products that customers, not just scientists, can use.

Quantonation’s expanded fund will target roughly 25 companies, writing larger checks and backing startups through earlier stages and scaling phases alike.

The portfolio already spans quantum computing hardware, advanced materials, sensing systems, and even components aimed at preparing infrastructure for widespread quantum deployment. Investments so far include:

This spread illustrates both a depth and a breadth of conviction: rather than betting on a single application, the fund’s investors are backing an ecosystem of physics-driven companies that could redefine multiple industries.

Despite this progress, Europe still trails the U.S. and China in private investment scale for quantum technologies, where large funding pools have helped local startups rapidly expand and commercialize.

The quantum revolution often gets discussed in terms of qubits and breakthrough physics. But investors and industry leaders increasingly see the future as one where quantum systems must integrate into real infrastructure, real supply chains, and real commercial stacks.

With €220 million under management, Quantonation is now one of the largest dedicated funds in its niche, a distinction that positions Europe more firmly in the global competition over next-generation computing and sensing.

What was once a cluster of scattered bets on niche technology now looks like a coherent wave of strategic investment. Europe isn’t just funding quantum anymore; it’s building a commercial ecosystem that might one day compete at scale with global rivals.
