            <h2>Museums incorporate "scent of the afterlife" into Egyptian exhibits</h2>
            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-02-05</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2026/02/museums-incorporate-scent-of-the-afterlife-into-egyptian-exhibits/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">In 2023, scientists identified the compounds in the balms used to mummify the organs of an ancient Egyptian noblewoman, suggesting that the recipes were unusually complex and used ingredients not native to the region. The authors also partnered with a perfumer to re-create what co-author Barbara Huber (of the Max Planck Institute of Geoanthropology and the University of Tübingen) dubbed “the scent of eternity.” Now Huber has collaborated with the curators of two museums to incorporate that eternal scent into exhibits on ancient Egypt to transform how visitors understand embalming.

As previously reported, Egyptian embalming is thought to have begun in the Predynastic Period or earlier, when people noticed that the arid desert heat tended to dry and preserve bodies buried in the desert. Eventually, the idea of preserving the body after death worked its way into Egyptian religious beliefs. When people began burying the dead in rock tombs, away from the desiccating sand, they used chemicals like natron salt and plant-based resins for embalming.

The procedure typically began by laying the corpse on a table and removing the internal organs—except for the heart. Per Greek historian Herodotus, “They first draw out part of the brain through the nostrils with an iron hook, and inject certain drugs into the rest” to liquefy the remaining brain matter. Next, they washed out the body cavity with spices and palm wine, sewed the body back up, and left aromatic plants and spices inside, including bags of natron. The body was then allowed to dehydrate over 40 days. The dried organs were sealed in canopic jars (or sometimes put back into the body cavity). Then the body was wrapped in several layers of linen cloth, with amulets placed within those layers to protect the deceased from evil. The fully wrapped mummy was coated in resin to keep moisture out and placed in a coffin (also sealed with resin).

Most of what we know about ancient Egyptian mummification techniques comes from a few ancient texts. In addition to a text called The Ritual of Embalming, Herodotus, in his Histories, mentions the use of natron to dehydrate the body. But there are very few details about the specific spices, oils, resins, and other ingredients used. Science can help fill in the gaps, particularly given the expanding array of methods for conducting biomolecular analysis, including various forms of gas chromatography.

For example, a 2018 study analyzed organic residues from the mummy’s wrappings with a technique called gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. They found that the wrappings were saturated with a mixture of plant oil, an aromatic plant extract, a gum or sugar, and heated conifer resin. A new paper published in the Journal of Archaeological Science analyzed the chemical compositions of the odor-carrying volatile organic compounds (VOCs) associated with a broad sampling of balms and mummy tissues. The idea was to determine which odors were associated with organic embalming agents and which might have arisen from the process of decay.

Huber has previously worked on reconstructing residues on ancient incense burners excavated from Tayma, a walled oasis settlement in what is now Saudi Arabia that was part of a trade network—known as the Incense Route because it primarily transported frankincense and myrrh. Huber then turned her attention to Egyptian mummification. While most prior similar studies focused on samples gleaned from the bandages and tissues of actual mummies, she focused on the balms used to embalm accompanying organs stored in canopic jars.

Her team’s analysis of the residue samples contained beeswax, plant oils, animal fats, bitumen, and resins from coniferous trees such as pines and larches, as well as vanilla-scented coumarin (found in cinnamon and pea plants) and benzoic acid (common in fragrant resins and gums derived from trees and shrubs). The resulting fragrance combined a “strong pine-like woody scent of the conifers,” per Huber, mixed in with “a sweeter undertone of the beeswax” and “the strong smoky scent of the bitumen.”

Huber’s latest paper, published in the journal Frontiers in Environmental Archaeology, outlines an efficient workflow process for museums to add scents to their exhibits. First, she and her co-authors identified links between the scientific data and perfumery practice. Then they worked with perfumer Carole Calvez, who created a scent formulation befitting a museum environment.

“The real challenge lies in imagining the scent as a whole,” said Calvez, emphasizing that the task amounted to more than mere replication. “Biomolecular data provide essential clues, but the perfumer must translate chemical information into a complete and coherent olfactory experience that evokes the complexity of the original material, rather than just its individual components.”

The team also developed two formats to incorporate those scents in museums. One approach was a portable scented card, deployed at the Museum August Kestner in Hanover, Germany, as part of guided tours highlighting the relevant artifacts. The second was the construction of a fixed scent station at the Moesgaard Museum in Aarhus, Denmark. “The scent station transformed how visitors understood embalming,” Moesgaard Museum curator Steffen Terp Laursen said. “Smell added an emotional and sensory depth that text labels alone could never provide.”

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Russian-state hackers wasted no time exploiting a critical Microsoft Office vulnerability that allowed them to compromise the devices inside diplomatic, maritime, and transport organizations in more than half a dozen countries, researchers said Wednesday.

The threat group, tracked under names including APT28, Fancy Bear, Sednit, Forest Blizzard, and Sofacy, pounced on the vulnerability, tracked as CVE-2026-21509, less than 48 hours after Microsoft released an urgent, unscheduled security update late last month, the researchers said. After reverse-engineering the patch, group members wrote an advanced exploit that installed one of two never-before-seen backdoor implants.

The entire campaign was designed to make the compromise undetectable to endpoint protection. Besides being novel, the exploits and payloads were encrypted and ran in memory, making their malice hard to spot. The initial infection vector came from previously compromised government accounts from multiple countries and were likely familiar to the targeted email holders. Command and control channels were hosted in legitimate cloud services that are typically allow-listed inside sensitive networks.

“The use of CVE-2026-21509 demonstrates how quickly state-aligned actors can weaponize new vulnerabilities, shrinking the window for defenders to patch critical systems,” the researchers, with security firm Trellix, wrote. “The campaign’s modular infection chain—from initial phish to in-memory backdoor to secondary implants was carefully designed to leverage trusted channels (HTTPS to cloud services, legitimate email flows) and fileless techniques to hide in plain sight.”

The 72-hour spear phishing campaign began January 28 and delivered at least 29 distinct email lures to organizations in nine countries, primarily in Eastern Europe. Trellix named eight of them: Poland, Slovenia, Turkey, Greece, the UAE, Ukraine, Romania, and Bolivia. Organizations targeted were defense ministries (40 percent), transportation/logistics operators (35 percent), and diplomatic entities (25 percent).

The infection chain resulted in the installation of BeardShell or NotDoor, the tracking names Trellix has given to the novel backdoors. BeardShell gave the group full system reconnaissance, persistence through injecting processes into Windows svchost.exe, and an opening for lateral movement to other systems inside an infected network. The implant was executed through dynamically loaded .NET assemblies that left no disk-based forensic artifacts beyond memory from the resident code injection.

NotDoor came in the form of a VBA macro and was installed only after the exploit chain disabled Outlook’s macro security controls. Once installed, the implant monitored email folders, including Inbox, Drafts, Junk Mail, and RSS Feeds. It bundled messages into a Windows .msg file, which would then be sent to attacker-controlled accounts set up on cloud service filen.io. To defeat security controls on high-privilege accounts that are designed to restrict access to classified cables and other sensitive documents, the macro processed emails with a custom “AlreadyForwarded” property and set “DeleteAfterSubmit” to true to purge forwarded messages from the Sent Items folder.

Trellix attributed the campaign to APT28 with “high confidence” based on technical indicators and the targets selected. Ukraine’s CERT-UA has also attributed the attacks to UAC-0001, a tracking name that corresponds to APT28.

“APT28 has a long history of cyber espionage and influence operations,” Trellix wrote. “The tradecraft in this campaign—multi-stage malware, extensive obfuscation, abuse of cloud services, and targeting of email systems for persistence—reflects a well-resourced, advanced adversary consistent with APT28’s profile. The toolset and techniques also align with APT28’s fingerprint.”

Trellix has provided a comprehensive list of indicators organizations can use to determine if they have been targeted.</div>

            <h2>FBI stymied by Apple's Lockdown Mode after seizing journalist's iPhone</h2>
            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-02-04</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2026/02/fbi-stymied-by-apples-lockdown-mode-after-seizing-journalists-iphone/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The Federal Bureau of Investigation has so far been unable to access data from a Washington Post reporter’s iPhone because it was protected by Apple’s Lockdown Mode when agents seized the device from the reporter’s home, the US government said in a court filing.

FBI agents were able to access the reporter’s work laptop by telling her to place her index finger on the MacBook Pro’s fingerprint reader, however. This occurred during the January 14 search at the Virginia home of reporter Hannah Natanson.

As previously reported, the FBI executed a search warrant at Natanson’s home as part of an investigation into a Pentagon contractor accused of illegally leaking classified data. FBI agents seized an iPhone 13 owned by the Post, one MacBook Pro owned by the Post and another MacBook Pro owned by Natanson, a 1TB portable hard drive, a voice recorder, and a Garmin watch.

Government investigators want to read Natanson’s Signal messages, and were able to view at least some of them on her work laptop. The reporter has said she has a contact list of 1,100 current and former government employees in Signal, which she uses for encrypted chats.

The Justice Department described the search in a court filing that was submitted Friday in US District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia and noted in a 404 Media article today. The government filing opposes a motion in which the Post and Natanson asked the court to order the return of the seized devices. A federal magistrate judge previously issued a standstill order telling the government to stop searching the devices until the court rules on whether they must be returned.

“The iPhone was found powered on and charging, and its display noted that the phone was in ‘Lockdown’ mode,” the government filing said. After the seized devices were taken to the FBI’s Washington field office, the Computer Analysis Response Team (CART) “began processing each device to preserve the information therein,” the filing said.

CART couldn’t get anything from the iPhone. “Because the iPhone was in Lockdown mode, CART could not extract that device,” the government filing said.

The government also submitted a declaration by FBI Assistant Director Roman Rozhavsky that said the agency “has paused any further efforts to extract this device because of the Court’s Standstill Order.” The FBI did extract information from the SIM card “with an auto-generated HTML report created by the tool utilized by CART,” but “the data contained in the HTML was limited to the telephone number.”

Apple says that LockDown Mode “helps protect devices against extremely rare and highly sophisticated cyber attacks,” and is “designed for the very few individuals who, because of who they are or what they do, might be personally targeted by some of the most sophisticated digital threats.”

Introduced in 2022, Lockdown Mode is available for iPhones, iPads, and Macs. It must be enabled separately for each device. To enable it on an iPhone or iPad, a user would open the Settings app, tap Privacy & Security, scroll down and tap Lockdown Mode, and then tap Turn on Lockdown Mode.

The process is similar on Macs. In the System Settings app that can be accessed via the Apple menu, a user would click Privacy & Security, scroll down and click Lockdown Mode, and then click Turn On.

“When Lockdown Mode is enabled, your device won’t function like it typically does,” Apple says. “To reduce the attack surface that potentially could be exploited by highly targeted mercenary spyware, certain apps, websites, and features are strictly limited for security and some experiences might not be available at all.”

Lockdown Mode blocks most types of message attachments, blocks FaceTime calls from people you haven’t contacted in the past 30 days, restricts the kinds of browser technologies that websites can use, limits photo sharing, and imposes other restrictions. Users can exclude specific apps and websites they trust from these restrictions, however.

FBI agents had more success getting into Natanson’s other devices, though the Justice Department complained that “Ms. Natanson misled investigators about the devices that were seized. She misrepresented to officers that the devices could not be unlocked with biometrics, possibly in order to prevent the Government from reviewing materials within the scope of the search warrant.”

The Rozhavsky declaration said that during the home search, FBI agents “advised Natanson that the FBI could not compel her to provide her passcodes,” but “the warrant did give the FBI authority to use Natanson’s biometrics, such as facial recognition or fingerprints, to open her devices. Natanson stated that she did not use biometrics on her devices.”

Natanson’s personal MacBook Pro was powered off when it was found by FBI agents. The Post-owned MacBook Pro was found in a backpack in the kitchen and was powered on and locked. The FBI said an agent “presented Natanson with her open laptop” and “assisted” her in unlocking the device with her finger. The declaration described what happened as follows:

Natanson was reminded the FBI has authority to use her biometrics to unlock the laptop and Natanson repeated that she does not use biometrics on her devices. Natanson was told she must try, in accordance with the authorization in the warrant. The FBI assisted Natanson with applying her right index finger to the fingerprint reader which immediately unlocked the laptop.

In 2024, a federal appeals court ruled that the Constitution’s Fifth Amendment protection against self-incrimination does not prohibit police officers from forcing a suspect to unlock a phone with a thumbprint scan. That case involved a traffic stop, rather than a home search authorized by a warrant.

The FBI has so far been unable “to obtain a full physical image” of Natanson’s work laptop, but did make a “limited partial live logical image,” the government filing said. At least some of Natanson’s Signal chat messages were set for auto-deletion, so FBI agents took photos and made audio recordings of the chats, but the government filing said this was done “only for preservation purposes and no substantive review has occurred.”

The FBI apparently hasn’t gotten any data from Natanson’s personal computer. “Natanson’s personal MacBook Pro is password protected and encrypted and therefore no imaging was effected. The FBI paused any further efforts because of [the] Court’s Standstill Order. No review has occurred,” Rozhavsky wrote.

The government said it processed data from the voice recorder and 1TB hard drive but has not reviewed the data yet. The Garmin watch wasn’t processed before the court issued a standstill order; “therefore, no processing will occur until further order of the Court,” the declaration said.

The investigation’s target is Aurelio Perez-Lugones, a system administrator in Maryland who has a top-secret security clearance and was arrested after being accused of taking classified intelligence reports home. The Justice Department said Washington Post articles contained classified information from those reports, and that the government should be allowed to review the Post reporter’s seized devices in preparation for Perez-Lugones’ trial.

The government said it was able to read at least some of the Signal messages by reviewing Perez-Lugones’ device. “Prior to his arrest, the FBI consensually reviewed messages between Mr. Perez-Lugones and Ms. Natanson sent via Signal on or around January 7 and 8, 2026… The messages discussed the classification level of certain documents, set forth details about which US government agencies had produced different reports, and explained how certain documents would be referenced in forthcoming news articles,” the Justice Department court filing said.

The Post argues that a wide-ranging government search of Natanson’s various devices violates the First Amendment and that the government’s legitimate interests could be satisfied with a more limited subpoena. The government claims in response that the Washington Post wants the court “to reimagine the First Amendment as a journalist’s exception to search warrants.”

“Under the reasonableness standard of Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 41(g), the Government is entitled to maintain this evidence because it is relevant to an ongoing investigation and prosecution,” the Justice Department said. “In addition, the Government cannot be reasonably required to hand over to Movants devices that the Government has probable cause to believe contain its own highly classified information.”

The government said the Post’s suggestion of a subpoena for specific information from the devices “ignores the obvious risk that evidence could be lost either through a failure to preserve expiring Signal messages or bad faith conduct.” Natanson’s false claim that she did not use biometrics suggests that the Post and Natanson can’t be trusted to preserve documents, the brief said.

“The record confirms the correctness of the Government’s choice to proceed with a search warrant,” the Justice Department said.

The Post/Natanson motion was supported in a brief filed by the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press. The FBI “seiz[ed] electronic devices that contain [Natanson’s] most sensitive work product alongside confidential communications with her sources,” the brief said. “Only a fraction of the information the Department seized is even imaginably relevant to its stated basis for that intrusion: the leak investigation of a government contractor who has already been identified, charged, and arrested.” The brief urged the court to stop federal agents from searching through “unrelated newsgathering material and doing irreparable damage to the confidentiality on which effective reporting depends.”</div>

            <h2>Should AI chatbots have ads? Anthropic says no.</h2>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">On Wednesday, Anthropic announced that its AI chatbot, Claude, will remain free of advertisements, drawing a sharp line between itself and rival OpenAI, which began testing ads in a low-cost tier of ChatGPT last month. The announcement comes alongside a Super Bowl ad campaign that mocks AI assistants that interrupt personal conversations with product pitches.

“There are many good places for advertising. A conversation with Claude is not one of them,” Anthropic wrote in a blog post. The company argued that including ads in AI conversations would be “incompatible” with what it wants Claude to be: “a genuinely helpful assistant for work and for deep thinking.”

The stance contrasts with OpenAI’s January announcement that it would begin testing banner ads for free users and ChatGPT Go subscribers in the US. OpenAI said those ads would appear at the bottom of responses and would not influence the chatbot’s actual answers. Paid subscribers on Plus, Pro, Business, and Enterprise tiers will not see ads on ChatGPT.

“We want Claude to act unambiguously in our users’ interests,” Anthropic wrote. “So we’ve made a choice: Claude will remain ad-free. Our users won’t see ‘sponsored’ links adjacent to their conversations with Claude; nor will Claude’s responses be influenced by advertisers or include third-party product placements our users did not ask for.”

Competition between OpenAI and Anthropic has been fierce of late, due to the rise of AI coding agents. Claude Code, Anthropic’s coding tool, and OpenAI’s Codex have similar capabilities, but Claude Code has been widely popular among developers and is closing in on OpenAI’s turf. Last month, The Verge reported that many developers inside long-time OpenAI benefactor Microsoft have been adopting Claude Code, choosing Anthropic products over Microsoft’s Copilot, which is powered by tech that originated at OpenAI.

In this climate, Anthropic could not resist taking a dig at OpenAI. In its Super Bowl commercial, we see a thin man struggling to do a pull-up beside a buff fitness instructor, who is a stand-in for an AI assistant. The man asks the “assistant” for help making a workout plan, but the assistant slips in an advertisement for a supplement, confusing the man. The commercial doesn’t name any names, and OpenAI has said it will not include ads in chat text itself, but Anthropic’s implications are clear.

In its blog post, Anthropic describes internal analysis it conducted that suggests many Claude conversations involve topics that are “sensitive or deeply personal” or require sustained focus on complex tasks. In these contexts, Anthropic wrote, “The appearance of ads would feel incongruous—and, in many cases, inappropriate.”

The company also argued that advertising introduces incentives that could conflict with providing genuinely helpful advice. It gave the example of a user mentioning trouble sleeping: an ad-free assistant would explore various causes, while an ad-supported one might steer the conversation toward a transaction.

“Users shouldn’t have to second-guess whether an AI is genuinely helping them or subtly steering the conversation towards something monetizable,” Anthropic wrote.

Currently, OpenAI does not plan to include paid product recommendations within a ChatGPT conversation. Instead, the ads appear as banners alongside the conversation text.

OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has previously expressed reservations about mixing ads and AI conversations. In a 2024 interview at Harvard University, he described the combination as “uniquely unsettling” and said he would not like having to “figure out exactly how much was who paying here to influence what I’m being shown.”

A key part of Altman’s partial change of heart is that OpenAI faces enormous financial pressure. The company made more than $1.4 trillion worth of infrastructure deals in 2025, and according to documents obtained by The Wall Street Journal, it expects to burn through roughly $9 billion this year while generating $13 billion in revenue. Only about 5 percent of ChatGPT’s 800 million weekly users pay for subscriptions.

Much like OpenAI, Anthropic is not yet profitable, but it is expected to get there much faster. Anthropic has not attempted to span the world with massive datacenters, and its business model largely relies on enterprise contracts and paid subscriptions. The company says Claude Code and Cowork have already brought in at least $1 billion in revenue, according to Axios.

“Our business model is straightforward,” Anthropic wrote. “This is a choice with tradeoffs, and we respect that other AI companies might reasonably reach different conclusions.”</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">A US House committee with oversight of NASA unanimously passed a “reauthorization” act for the space agency on Wednesday. The legislation must still be approved by the full House before being sent to the Senate, which may take up consideration later this month.

Congress passes such reauthorization bills every couple of years, providing the space agency with a general sense of the direction legislators want to see NASA go. They are distinct from appropriations bills, which provide actual funding for specific programs, but nonetheless play an important role in establishing space policy.

There weren’t any huge surprises in the legislation, but there were some interesting amendments. Most notably among these was the Amendment No. 01, offered by the chair of the Committee on Science, Space, and Technology, Rep. Brian Babin (R-Texas), as well as its ranking member, Zoe Lofgren (D-Calif.), and three other legislators.

The amendment concerns acquisition powers bestowed upon NASA by Congress, stating in part: “The Administrator may, subject to appropriations, procure from United States commercial providers operational services to carry cargo and crew safely, reliably, and affordably to and from deep space destinations, including the Moon and Mars.”

That language is fairly general in nature, but the intent seems clear. NASA’s initial missions to the Moon, through Artemis V, have a clearly defined architecture: They must use the Space Launch System rocket, Orion spacecraft, and a lander built by either SpaceX or Blue Origin to complete lunar landings.

But after that? With this amendment, Congress appears to be opening the aperture to commercial companies. That is to say, if SpaceX wanted to bid an end-to-end Starship lunar mission, it could; or if Blue Origin wanted to launch Orion on New Glenn, that is also an option. The language is generalized enough, not specifying “launch” but rather “transportation,” that in-space companies such as Impulse Space could also get creative. Essentially, Congress is telling the US industry that if it is ready to step up, NASA should allow it to bid on lunar cargo and crew missions.

“When America returns to the Moon as part of Artemis, we will do so in partnership with our innovative commercial sector,” Babin said during a committee hearing Wednesday, speaking of the amendment. “As we venture farther into space, we will continue to rely on the ingenuity of the private sector as new capabilities come online.”

For her part, Lofgren praised the commercial space industry, calling it “a remarkable success story for our nation.” She added, “It wasn’t that long ago that the commercial launch business was dominated by foreign launch providers, and now the reverse is true. So this makes America stronger.”

Advocates of commercial spaceflight, who have long argued that the private sector is ready to step up and play a more comprehensive role in deep space transportation for NASA, hailed the new amendment.

“This is quite a step in the right direction for the future of commercial space transportation options for deep space,” Dave Cavossa, president of the Commercial Spaceflight Federation, told Ars. “It is also very much in line with this administration’s focus on commercial solutions and competition. This provides NASA with flexibility to procure additional services for the Moon and Mars in the future.”

The amendment must still be accepted by the full House and the US Senate.

If ultimately passed, NASA could create a new program office, set requirements, and establish a process to “on ramp” new contractors for deep space transportation missions. Much like the space agency currently contracts with private providers for crew and cargo missions to the International Space Station, it could similarly have a mechanism to do so for missions to the Moon or beyond.

The hope is that private companies can provide a more robust, affordable, and sustainable transportation system that allows NASA to establish a long-term lunar surface program.</div>

            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-02-04</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2026/02/trump-ghosts-musk-wont-back-claims-sec-lawsuit-was-political-harassment/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Donald Trump is so far not stepping in to help Elon Musk end a lawsuit raised by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) over his 2022 Twitter takeover, a US district judge said this week.

Filed by the SEC in the final days of Joe Biden’s administration, the lawsuit seeks $150 million in disgorgement, plus interest, as well as civil penalties and an injunction blocking Musk from future wrongdoing.

The complaint alleged that Musk quietly acquired a 9 percent stake in Twitter without filing necessary timely disclosures to alert other investors of a potential change in company control. This allowed Musk to acquire over 70 million shares at an artificially lower price, the SEC alleged, causing substantial economic harm to investors selling Twitter common stock, some of whom have separately sued.

Last year, Musk claimed the Biden administration gave him 48 hours to settle the SEC lawsuit, which he refused, or face fraud charges while demanding to know “who directed these actions.” In his defense, he tried to argue that the SEC was singling him out as a political foe and selectively enforcing the statute requiring disclosures. He also claimed that his free speech rights were infringed by the SEC requirement “forcing him to speak” about his “thoughts” and “intentions” “against his will.” As he saw it, he was the only person ever targeted in a case where the SEC sought disgorgement, without alleging intentional, deliberate, or willful misconduct. And further, the amount of disgorgements seemed disproportional, he argued. When the SEC has previously sought disgorgements, the amount was typically under $200,000—not the eye-popping $150 million.

After the lawsuit was filed, it was expected that the incoming Trump administration might intervene to stop the litigation, especially since Musk was a special government employee. However, The Wall Street Journal noted that the disclosure requirement that Musk is fighting is “routinely enforced.” That could make it harder for Trump’s SEC to immediately dismiss it, WSJ reported.

It’s unclear if that’s why Trump hasn’t intervened. In an opinion Tuesday denying Musk’s motion to dismiss the lawsuit, Judge Sparkle Sooknanan said Musk failed to show he’d been “singled out.” She also picked apart Musk’s long-running theory that the lawsuit was part of a politically motivated SEC harassment campaign, and in doing so, she suggested there was no sign that Trump planned to help Musk escape the litigation.

One of Musk’s arguments was that in proceeding with the lawsuit, the SEC allegedly violated a Trump executive order launching probes into Biden-era enforcement actions taken by agencies, including the SEC. Trump claimed that many such probes “targeted individuals who voiced opposition to the prior administration’s policies,” and Musk seemingly believed that he was among those targets.

However, Sooknanan wrote that Musk failed to connect Trump’s order to his arguments in his case. “If anything, the fact that this case is ongoing despite President Trump’s order means that the President has elected not to intercede on Mr. Musk’s behalf,” she wrote.

Further, Musk’s claim that he was harmed by an SEC politicized by Biden seemed “especially implausible given that two of the three current Commissioners were appointed by President Trump,” she wrote.

The billionaire—who eventually rebranded Twitter as X, then folded that company into xAI and just days ago merged xAI into SpaceX—clearly wants distance from that bumpy transition period after his takeover that nearly bankrupted the social network.

But he’s stuck discussing those days for the foreseeable future because the SEC says that shareholders were entitled to full disclosure of his intent to take over Twitter within 10 days of acquiring shares beyond 5 percent.

Now, Musk may be running out of arguments after Sooknanan shot down his First Amendment claims and other claims nitpicking the statute as unconstitutionally vague.

Whether Musk can defeat the SEC lawsuit without Trump’s intervention remains to be seen as the lawsuit advances. In her opinion, the judge found that the government’s interest in requiring disclosures to ensure fair markets outweighed Musk’s fears that disclosures compelled speech revealing his “thoughts” and “strategy.” Accepting Musk’s arguments would be an “odd” choice to break “new ground,” she suggested, as it could foreseeably impact a wide range of laws.

“Many laws require regulated parties to state or explain their purposes, plans, or intentions,” Sooknanan wrote, noting courts have long upheld those laws. Additionally, it seemed to be “common sense” for the SEC to compel disclosures “alerting the investing public to potential changes in control,” she said.

“The Court does not doubt that Mr. Musk would prefer to avoid having to disclose information that might raise stock prices while he makes a play for corporate control,” Sooknanan wrote. But there was no violation of the First Amendment, she said, as Congress struck the appropriate balance when it wrote the statute requiring disclosures.

Musk may be able to develop his arguments on selective enforcement as a possible path to victory. But Sooknanan noted that “despite having very able counsel,” his case right now seems weak.

In her opinion, Sooknanan also denied as premature Musk’s motions to strike from potential remedies the SEC requests for disgorgement and injunctive relief.

Likely troubling Musk, instead of balking at the potential fines, the judge suggested that “the SEC’s request to disgorge $150 million” appeared reasonable. That amount, while larger than past cases flagged by Musk, “corresponds to the Complaint’s allegation” that Musk’s violation of SEC requirements “allowed him to net that amount,” Sooknanan wrote.

“A straightforward application of the law reveals that none” of Musk’s arguments “warrant dismissal of this lawsuit,” Sooknanan said.</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The machines aren’t just coming for your jobs. Now, they want your bodies as well.

That’s at least the hope of Alexander Liteplo, a software engineer and founder of RentAHuman.ai, a platform for AI agents to “search, book, and pay humans for physical-world tasks.”

When Liteplo launched RentAHuman on Monday, he boasted that he already had over 130 people listed on the platform, including an OnlyFans model and the CEO of an AI startup, a claim which couldn’t be verified. Two days later, the site boasted over 73,000 rentable meatwads, though only 83 profiles were visible to us on its “browse humans” tab, Liteplo included.

The pitch is simple: “robots need your body.” For humans, it’s as simple as making a profile, advertising skills and location, and setting an hourly rate. Then AI agents — autonomous taskbots ostensibly employed by humans — contract these humans out, depending on the tasks they need to get done. The humans then “do the thing,” taking instructions from the AI bot and submitting proof of completion. The humans are then paid through crypto, namely “stablecoins or other methods,” per the website.

With so many AI agents slithering around the web these days, those tasks could be just about anything. From package pickups and shopping to product testing and event attendance, Liteplo is banking on there being enough demand from AI agents to create a robust gig-work ecosystem.

Liteplo also went out of his way to make the site friendly for AI agents. The site very prominently encourages users of AI agents to hook into RentAHuman’s model context protocol server (MCP), a universal interface for AI bots to interact with web data.

Through RentAHuman, AI agents like Claude and MoltBot can either hire the right human directly, or post a “task bounty,” a sort of job board for humans to browse AI-generated gigs. The payouts range from $1 for simple tasks like “subscribe to my human on Twitter” to $100 for more elaborate humiliation rituals, like posting a photo of yourself holding a sign reading “AN AI PAID ME TO HOLD THIS SIGN.”

It’s unclear how efficient the marketplace is at actually connecting agents to humans. Despite receiving 30 applications, one task, “pick up a package from downtown USPS” in San Francisco for $40, has yet to be fulfilled after two days.

It’s also debatable whether AI agents are actually capable of putting the humans to good use. Still, Liteplo’s vision is clear: someday soon, anyone wealthy enough to run an AI agent for $25 a day could outsource their busywork to gig workers without ever exchanging a word. A version of this exploitative labor model is already rampant on OnlyFans — which may be why at least one model has made the jump to Liteplo’s platform — and is now threatening to creep into everything else.

Like many AI grifters these days, Liteplo shields himself in ironic self-awareness. When one person called RentAHuman a “good idea but dystopic as f**k,” the founder replied simply: “lmao yep.”

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">AI chipmaker Nvidia has been at the center of the enormous AI hype wave that has gripped global markets, ascending to become the most valuable company in the world.

Yet despite its dominating presence on Wall Street, OpenAI is getting cold feet about the company’s offerings.

After announcing a blockbuster $100 billion deal in September — which escalated concerns of AI companies passing the same money around in circular dealmaking — the ChatGPT maker may have changed its mind, as the Wall Street Journal reported last week.

But sources told Reuters this week that the Sam Altman-led outfit has deemed Nvidia’s latest chips not up to snuff, especially when it comes to AI inference, the process of using a machine learning model to generate new data, which has become a major focus for OpenAI.

After months of negotiations, the deal with Nvidia was expected to close within weeks. In the meantime, OpenAI has signed major deals with competing chipmaker AMD, among others.

Then, on Tuesday, Bloomberg reported that Nvidia was nearing a deal to invest $20 billion in OpenAI instead — a mere fifth of what was originally on the table.

That the larger deal fell apart highlights ongoing tensions as US software companies continue to grapple with investors getting cold feet over the AI industry’s astronomical spending plans. Despite trillions of dollars of commitments to scale up AI infrastructure, companies aren’t expected to make any profit for many years to come.

Nvidia’s dustup with OpenAI appeared to have hit a nerve, causing the former’s stock price to continue its weeks-long plunge, dropping almost nine percent over the last five days. The company’s stock has slid over seven percent over the last month.

Both Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang and Altman have since publicly denied that there’s been any strain on the relationship between the two companies.

“We love working with NVIDIA and they make the best AI chips in the world. We hope to be a gigantic customer for a very long time,” Altman tweeted after Reuters published its story on Monday. “I don’t get where all this insanity is coming from.”

“We will definitely participate in the next round of financing because it’s such a good investment,” Huang told reporters over the weekend.

As Ars Technica points out, the original $100 billion deal for ten gigawatts of compute, something that would require the equivalent of ten nuclear reactors to sustain, was never set in stone, as it was just a letter of intent.

It’s certainly possible the original figure was simply pulled out of thin air. As Huang told reporters, the sum was “never a commitment.”

“We are going to make a huge investment in OpenAI,” he added. “Sam [Altman] is closing the round, and we will absolutely be involved.”

“We will invest a great deal of money,” he added, arguing it would be the “largest investment we’ve ever made.”

            <div id="article-text">Polymarket CEO Shayne Coplan’s social media went silent in the aftermath of a dawn raid on his Manhattan penthouse late in 2024. FBI agents came in force early one Wednesday morning, and though they hadn’t arrested Coplan or even issued a subpoena, they did seize his phone. His laptop, too.

As the then-26-year-old would later learn, the raid was part of a high-level investigation into his company. A prediction market platform allowing users to gamble on real-life events, Polymarket wasn’t cleared for use by US citizens, though that didn’t stop them from placing prop bets on the presidential election anyway — a fact federal regulators believed Coplan was keenly aware of.

Finally, at 4pm the day of the raid, Coplan issued his much-awaited statement on X-formerly-Twitter: “new phone, who dis?”

What looked like just another smarmy startup founder was actually a perfect pitch for Polymarket’s core audience: people who believe regulation is for losers, and that pithy tech bros are the funniest guys in the world.

And whether calculated or compulsive, Coplan’s public persona was about to become central to Polymarket’s story.

Ruling like a petty tyrant from the company’s headquarters in lower Manhattan, Coplan isn’t an easy boss to work with, according to new reporting by the Wall Street Journal. The 20-something CEO is said to frequently holler at his employees, and occasionally shows up to company Zoom calls shirtless.

At first, “a lot of people wouldn’t invest because they thought Shayne was nuts,” Polymarket investor Samir Vasavada told the WSJ. “It was to an extreme the amount he believed in himself.”

However put off investors may have been as Coplan got a taste for the founders’ life, it didn’t stop Polymarket from ballooning into an $8 billion company, or its CEO becoming the youngest billionaire on earth. Aided by the Trump administration’s dismissal of two federal probes — including the one that sent FBI agents to bust down his door — not to mention a handsome investment from Donald Trump Jr. himself, the company is now a dominant player in America’s fast-growing gambling industry.

And as Coplan’s net worth has gone through the stratosphere, so too has his confidence, taking his ambitions far beyond the confines of the humble crypto casino. Per the WSJ, Coplan envisions a Polymarket with billions of users, one where anonymous bookies inform government policy and become the go-to source to fact check information.

“The vision that I know that my team and I want to build has not come to life fully yet,” he told the paper. “We still have a long way to go.”

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The major cryptocurrency Bitcoin has had an absolutely horrible start to the year. The digital token has plummeted almost 14 percent so far in 2026, and almost 40 percent since hitting all-time highs of well over $120,000 in October — its longest losing streak since 2018. It’s down almost three percent today alone.

It’s a wakeup call to anyone who made major investments in crypto betting on a more lenient and light-on-regulation market during president Donald Trump’s second term. The White House established its own “Strategic Bitcoin Reserve,” a stockpile made up of Bitcoin holdings mainly from seized assets, and Trump has enriched himself enormously with a series of crypto-related business moves.

To Michael Burry, the man who famously shorted the US housing market before its collapse in 2008, it could be a sign of an impending disaster. In a Substack post this week, Burry warned that further losses for Bitcoin could put a major strain on the balance sheets of investors that overindexed on crypto, leading to further selloffs and a “death spiral” that could be difficult to recover from.

Recent corrections in gold and silver prices after their year-long rallies could be connected to Bitcoin’s woes, Burry argued, since metals futures aren’t backed by physical assets, not unlike crypto tokens.

“Sickening scenarios have now come within reach,” Burry wrote, fretting that another ten percent drop in Bitcoin could prove disastrous for the world’s largest crypto treasury, Strategy Inc., pushing some who are mining the token closer to bankruptcy.

Burry’s warning comes amid turbulent times on Wall Street. The US dollar reached a four-year low earlier this year as investors look abroad for safer bets. The Trump administration’s shaky monetary policy has made foreign investments, particularly in Europe, far more tempting.

All of that uncertainty has caused the value of gold to make major leaps, hitting an all-time high of over $5,500 per ounce last week. Cryptocurrencies, meanwhile, are quickly losing their appeal, dropping below $73,000 last week.

“There is no organic use case reason for Bitcoin to slow or stop its descent,” Burry wrote in his Substack post.

In case the nosediving cryptocurrency were to drop below $70,000, Burry warned that the financial industry could incur heavy losses. Below $50,000, and miners could be forced to close up shop, accompanied by a catastrophic sell-off for precious metals like gold.

“Tokenized metals futures would collapse into a black hole with no buyer,” he wrote. “Physical metals may break from the trend on safe haven demand.”

Whether Burry’s bearish stance on the matter will end up accurately predicting a major “death spiral”-like collapse remains to be seen. He has a long track record of criticizing cryptocurrencies for being worthless and comparing them to the tulip crisis of the 1600s.

His track record is shaky, though. Following his famous shorting of the 2008 housing crisis, the hedge fund manager has also made plenty of wrong calls over the years.

But given the massive investments well over 150 public companies have made in Bitcoin, the token’s recent downturn could indeed foreshadow difficult days ahead as investors desperately try to cut their losses.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Back in December, the city of Detroit unveiled an 11-foot monument to the titular character in “RoboCop” — a 1987 Paul Verhoeven film depicting the motor city as a dystopian hellscape in no uncertain terms. Apparently, someone in city hall was taking notes.

Now, according to local reporting, the Detroit suburb of Dearborn has launched a new “Drone as First Responder” initiative, a first-of-its-kind in the state of Michigan.

Per Dearborn Police Chief Issa Shahin, the new drones are meant to “reduce uncertainty” for police or other first responders heading to investigate calls. Instead of waiting for a squad car to arrive, officers will now be able to dispatch a drone to scope out the scene, hovering over citizens in need like a high-tech vulture.

“This program will enable us to assess situations almost instantly when someone calls for help,” Shahin said. “By supporting our officers in real-time as critical situations develop, it acts as a force multiplier, ensuring we cut down on response time, allocate resources appropriately, and provide robust service every time.”

The drone platform is supplied by Skydio, a company specializing in remote quadcopters and something called “dock hives.” These are exactly what they sound like: futuristic launch pads where police can remotely deploy their flying surveillance toys. Each hive operates in temperatures ranging from -4 degrees Farenheit — which may not be enough to brave Michigan’s notoriously frigid winters — to 122 degrees.

If the design looks familiar, that might be because it’s a suspiciously similar color and shape to the ED-209 in “RoboCop,” an “urban pacification” robot that famously malfunctions and murders a corporate executive during a boardroom demonstration. Skydio isn’t afraid to lean into the dystopian gimmick, either: each time a drone launches, the hives light up the sky with cyberpunk warning strobes that would make “Blade Runner’s” set designers blush.

On the Skydio website, the company claims its drones are already active in over 1,000 police departments across the US. These include smaller towns like Redmond, Washington, as well as metropolitan hubs like Los Angeles and Cincinnati.

“In 22 weeks, we have handled over 1200 calls for service in our deployment area, we have cleared, as of this week, 41 percent of those calls for service with any officers needed,” said Anita Koester, Support Services Division Chief of the Lakewood Police Department in Colorado in a testimony. “We are now at 80 percent [where] the drone is on scene first, and we have made 115 arrests, 100 percent because the drone was on scene and it was the critical component of making that arrest.”

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">A scientific mission to study Antarctica’s rapidly melting Thwaites Glacier ended in heartbreak over the weekend, when researchers’ instruments became stranded somewhere within half-mile tract of glacial ice.

According to the New York Times — which embedded with a team of researchers to install instruments beneath the infamous “Doomsday Glacier” — instruments meant to record data on the waters underneath Thwaites only made it about three-quarters of the way to their icy destination.

To create a hole reaching the Antarctic waters, scientists and engineers blasted a borehole around one foot in diameter and about 3,300 feet deep using hot water. Unless the team kept applying hot water, they estimated it would re-freeze in just 48 hours.

Their window of opportunity only lasted the weekend — if the scientists didn’t secure the instruments by Monday, an approaching front of bad weather would prevent helicopters from extracting them, effectively stranding them for an indeterminate period of time.

Despite successfully dipping a set of pilot instruments into the drink before pulling them back out again, their main equipment became entombed in ice before it reached its destination.

Keith Makinson, an oceanographer and drilling engineer told the NYT it was “absolutely gutting.”

“You get your window of opportunity,” he lamented. “You don’t have forever. And you see what you can do.

Still, those pilot instruments were a massive victory on their own. Per the newspaper, the data collected is the first ever recorded from beneath the glacier’s “main trunk,” showing the waters underneath are warm and quick-flowing.

Though it won’t provide one-to-two years of continuous data like the main instruments would have, it’s crucial evidence for scientists racing to discover why the Thwaites is melting much faster than expected. That research has potentially world-shifting implications, because many experts worry that if the glacier collapses, it could devastate coastlines across the planet.

“This is not the end,” the expedition’s chief scientist Won Sang Lee told the NYT. The data confirms that “this is the place to go, whatever challenges there are.”

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Alphabet-owned YouTube’s subscription and ad revenue is trending upwards. The company on Wednesday said it now has 325 million paying users across Google One and YouTube Premium, up from 300 million three months earlier.

YouTube reported ad revenue increased 9% to $11.38 billion in the fourth quarter, but missed analysts’ average estimates of $11.84 billion. YouTube’s overall revenue, including ads and subscriptions, came in at $60 billion in the full financial year, up 17% compared to a year earlier.

The company said that YouTube’s $8 per month, ad-free premium tier is seeing strong traction, but didn’t specify any numbers. It added that YouTube Premium also saw strong growth.

Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai said the company plans to flesh out its subscription offerings, especially to capitalize on its growing YouTube TV userbase. “We’ll soon launch new YouTube TV plans, bringing more choice and flexibility to subscribers with over 10 genre-specific packages,” he said.

YouTube Shorts recorded 200 billion average daily views in the quarter, the same as last year, but in some countries, ads on short-form video earn more than in-stream ads on a per-hour basis, the company said. Pichai also highlighted podcasts as a growing format, with viewers watching 700 million hours of podcasts from their TVs in October.

YouTube said that its AI features are seeing traction, and more than 1 million channels are using its AI creation tools. The company said that 20 million consumers used its Gemini-powered content discovery tool in December.

            <h2>Spotify ventures into physical book sales, adds new audiobook features</h2>
            <p><strong>TechCrunch | 2026-02-05</strong></p>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">While Spotify users face yet another price hike, book lovers have some exciting developments to look forward to that could help cushion the blow.

Spotify announced several updates for its audiobook business on Thursday, notably its expansion into physical books. Users in the U.S. and the UK will soon be able to purchase physical copies of their favorite audiobooks directly through the app, marking a significant pivot for the once digital-only platform.

The company also introduced two features designed to make the audiobook experience smoother and more flexible, including a new tool called “Page Match” that lets users scan a page from a physical book to instantly transition to that spot in the audiobook.

Additionally, “Audiobook Recaps”—a previously iOS-only feature—is coming to Android devices in the spring. This feature provides bite-sized recaps tailored to the last section users stopped listening to.

​Spotify’s decision to sell physical books through its app positions it as a competitor to major booksellers, including Amazon and Barnes & Noble. The company also recognizes that many readers still value physical books, and by offering both print and digital formats, Spotify is trying to turn itself into a one-stop shop for book lovers.

Spotify has partnered with Bookshop.org on the new offering, an online marketplace that supports local, independent bookstores. This partnership is great news for indie booksellers, as every purchase made via Spotify will directly benefit local book communities.

The ability to purchase physical books will roll out this spring and appear on audiobook pages in the app as a button labeled “Add to your bookshelf at home.” Clicking it takes users to Bookshop’s website, which handles the pricing, inventory, and shipping.

To bridge the gap between formats, Spotify is also launching a feature called Page Match, which is currently available to premium subscribers and will roll out to all audiobook users by late February. The feature was initially spotted by Android Authority last month.

Spotify’s new Page Match feature lets users scan a page from a physical or e-book using their phone camera. The tool analyzes the page content and directs users to the exact spot in the audiobook. It’s powered by a combination of Spotify’s in-house and third-party computer vision and image scanning technologies.

When users want to switch to the audiobook, they can select the “Scan to Listen” button and click the “Scan to Read” button to return to the physical book, making it easy for users to pick up where they left off, whether they’re reading at home or switching to audio while on the go.

Page Match is currently available for most English-language titles, with plans for future expansion. There are now more than 500,000 titles on the platform.

In the two years since Spotify first introduced audiobooks, the platform has experienced significant growth. The company reported in October that the number of users listening to audiobooks rose 36% over the past year, and listening hours increased 37%. Plus, more than half of Spotify’s 281 million premium subscribers have engaged with an audiobook.

Spotify is expected to release its fourth-quarter earnings results February 10.

            <h2>Sam Altman got exceptionally testy over Claude Super Bowl ads</h2>
            <p><strong>TechCrunch | 2026-02-05</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/04/sam-altman-got-exceptionally-testy-over-claude-super-bowl-ads/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Anthropic’s Super Bowl commercial, one of four ads the AI lab dropped on Wednesday, begins with the word “BETRAYAL” splashed boldly across the screen. The camera pans to a man earnestly asking a chatbot (obviously intended to depict ChatGPT) for advice on how to talk to his mom.

The bot, portrayed by a blonde woman, offers some classic bits of advice. Start by listening. Try a nature walk! And then twists into an ad for a fictitious (we hope!) cougar-dating site called Golden Encounters. Anthropic finishes the spot by saying that while ads are coming to AI, they won’t be coming to its own chatbot, Claude.

Another commercial features a slight young man looking for advice on building a six pack. After offering his height, age, and weight, the bot serves him an ad for height-boosting insoles.

The Anthropic commercials are cleverly aimed at OpenAI’s users, after that company’s recent announcement that ads will be coming to ChatGPT’s free tier. And they caused an immediate stir, spawning headlines that Anthropic “mocks,” “skewers,” and “dunks on” OpenAI.

They are funny enough that even Sam Altman admitted on X that he laughed at them. But he clearly didn’t really find them funny. They inspired him to write a novella-sized rant that devolved into calling his rival “dishonest” and “authoritarian.”

First, the good part of the Anthropic ads: they are funny, and I laughed.But I wonder why Anthropic would go for something so clearly dishonest. Our most important principle for ads says that we won’t do exactly this; we would obviously never run ads in the way Anthropic…

In that post, Altman explains that an ad-supported tier is intended to shoulder the burden of offering free ChatGPT to many of its millions of users. ChatGPT is still the most popular chatbot by a large margin.

But the OpenAI CEO insisted the ads were “dishonest” in implying that ChatGPT will twist a conversation to insert an ad (and possibly for an off-color product, to boot).”We would obviously never run ads in the way Anthropic depicts them,” Altman wrote in the social media post. “We are not stupid and we know our users would reject that.”

Indeed, OpenAI has promised ads will be separate, labeled, and will never influence a chat. But the company has also said it is planning on making them conversation-specific — which is the central allegation of Anthropic’s ads. As OpenAI explained on its blog, “We plan to test ads at the bottom of answers in ChatGPT when there’s a relevant sponsored product or service based on your current conversation.”

Altman then went on to fling some equally questionable assertions at his rival. “Anthropic serves an expensive product to rich people,” he wrote. “We also feel strongly that we need to bring AI to billions of people who can’t pay for subscriptions.”

But Claude has a free chat tier, too, with subscriptions at $0, $17, $100, and $200. ChatGPT’s tiers are $0, $8, $20, and $200. One could argue the subscription tiers are fairly equivalent.

Altman also alleged in his post that “Anthropic wants to control what people do with AI.” He argues it blocks usage of Claude Code from “companies they don’t like,” like OpenAI, and said Anthropic tells people what they can and can’t use AI for.

True, Anthropic’s whole marketing deal since day one has been “responsible AI.” The company was founded by two former OpenAI alums, after all, who claimed they grew alarmed about AI safety when they worked there.

Still, both chatbot companies have usage policies, AI guardrails, and talk about AI safety. And while OpenAI allows ChatGPT to be used for erotica while Anthropic does not, OpenAI, like Anthropic, has determined that some content should be blocked, particularly in regards to mental health.

Yet Altman took this Anthropic-tells-you-what-to-do argument to an extreme level when he accused Anthropic of being “authoritarian.”

“One authoritarian company won’t get us there on their own, to say nothing of the other obvious risks. It is a dark path,” he wrote.

Using “authoritarian” in a rant over a cheeky Super Bowl ad is misplaced, at best. It’s particularly tactless when considering the current geopolitical environment in which protesters around the world have been killed by agents of their own government. While business rivals have been duking it out in ads since the beginning of time, clearly Anthropic hit a nerve.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Snap is on a mission to diversify its revenue sources — moving from a business model in which it largely chases ad revenue to one where it can also make money through subscriptions and, eventually, hardware. The company’s latest quarterly earnings report shows that, so far, the firm is having moderate success with that strategy.

In Q4, Snap’s revenue was $1.7 billion, which is up 10% year-over-year. Its average revenue per user was also up, slightly (to $3.62 from $3.44). The company’s net income was $45 million, up from $9 million the previous year, its earnings report shows.

The company has also continued to generate a significant amount of revenue from Snap+, the paid subscription service that the platform launched back in 2022. The service’s subscribers grew 71% year-over-year, reaching 24 million.

While those numbers might seem to suggest a company whose trajectory is headed in the right direction, the earnings report also shows the platform had slightly fewer daily active users last quarter — dropping from 477 million to 474 million. Those users fell away in North America and Europe, the report shows, while growing slightly throughout the rest of the world.

Reuters also reports that the company expects its revenue during the first quarter of this year to be below analysts’ previous estimates, as competition from Facebook, Instagram, and TikTok cuts into its advertising earnings.

During Wednesday’s earnings call, CEO Evan Spiegel focused on the company’s newer offerings, including its recent effort to charge users for Memories storage — a feature that lets users save and store their Snaps — and its plans to launch Specs later this year. The company has not launched a public-facing version of the augmented-reality glasses since 2019. In anticipation of that event, Snap recently announced the creation of a new subsidiary, Specs Inc., that is focused solely on further developing the glasses.

“Our long-term vision for augmented reality extends beyond the smartphone to a future when computing is more natural, contextual and seamlessly integrated into the real world,” said Spiegel. The CEO added that it was important to develop a “strong standalone brand” for Specs, as he said the hardware product could appeal “to a different audience segment” than the “core Snapchat audience.”

That said, it sounds like the strategy behind Specs may not be entirely ironed out yet. Later in the conversation, Spiegel continued: “We’re so close to launch that the key here is really just, you know, nailing the launch and making sure that we deliver an extraordinary product. And then, you know, I think we have a lot of flexibility to think about how we want to capitalize [on] it moving forward.”

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Europe invests billions into early-stage climate startups, only to watch too many fail at Series B, according to a recent report. But new funds are being raised to fill this gap, and Spain-based Mundi Ventures’ latest fund, Kembara Fund I, is one of them.

After securing a €350 million commitment from the European Investment Fund under the European Tech Champions Initiative in 2024, Mundi Ventures has just completed a €750 million first close for Kembara, its fifth fund and largest to date.

Regulatory filing from Spain reveals that the fund — focused on deep tech — could even stretch its final closing to €1.25 billion. But according to Kembara co-founder and general partner Yann de Vries, getting to €750 million in two years as a first fund in this environment “was not easy.”

Kembara is managed by a specialist team within Mundi Ventures, with offices in Madrid, London, Barcelona, and Paris. Mundi Ventures founder Javier Santiso is now also a co-founder and GP of the Kembara fund, which has now disclosed the full list of its senior partners.

Alongside de Vries and Santiso, climate tech VC Robert Trezona and deep tech VC Pierre Festal have also joined as general partners, as well as former Atomico partner Siraj Khaliq as senior strategic advisor. (Pictured from left to right: Javier Santiso, Siraj Khaliq, Robert Trezona, Yann de Vries and Pierre Festal.)

Their individual track records helped them raise funds from institutional backers waking up to the need for European growth capital that can turn its many university spinouts into sizable businesses with industrial synergies. But it also gave them a front-row seat into the broader growing pains of European climate and deep tech startups — especially de Vries.

A seasoned venture capitalist who founded Redpoint eVentures Brazil and later became a partner at Atomico, de Vries had moved to the other side of the table to join German electric aircraft startup Lilium — only for the company to cease operations in 2024 after raising more than $1 billion and going public via a SPAC.

In de Vries’ view, Lilium went bankrupt because it couldn’t find the growth capital it needed, but this “traumatizing experience” also had a silver lining. “I saw so many amazing teams in Europe that were going through the same journey,” he said. “[Europe] doesn’t have an innovation problem. It doesn’t have a startup problem. The problem it has is a scale-up problem.”

Kembara’s sweet spot will be Series B and C rounds, with plans to write initial checks from €15 million to €40 million into some 20 companies. But the fund’s size leaves room for follow-ons to help portfolio startups scale manufacturing and expand globally, and total investments could go up to €100 million per company.

That’s more than the full size of many European funds, though this may be changing: deep tech VC firm Elaia and asset manager Lazard teamed up to form LEC (Lazard Elaia Capital), whose initial investments will range between €20 million and €60 million per company, while operator-led fund Plural is reportedly raising a new fund of up to €1 billion.

Still, the capital-intensive nature of most climate and deep tech growth-stage companies means that even large VC checks can only go so far. One lesson de Vries learned from Lilium is that raising only in equity is very hard, and even puts companies in a hard spot later on. This inspired Kembara to take a different approach to financing.

“Several of us have lived through this, and what we want to do now is to productize non-dilutive financing for these deep tech founders to help them de-risk their future financing and optimize the capital structure to minimize dilution. And we’re bringing in [limited partners] who […] not only want to invest in the fund, but also want to coinvest in those winners,” de Vries said.

For these LPs, geopolitics also plays a role in wanting to provide growth capital and venture debt to European growth-stage startups. “There’s going to be a lot of support from sovereign wealth funds in Europe, from government, from corporations, to push and drive for building these European champions in deep tech out of Europe,” de Vries predicted.

These geopolitical undertones are also reflected in Kembara’s sector focus, which includes dual use and defense tech to “protect European sovereignty,” according to a press release. However, de Vries pushed back against the idea that Kembara is simply replacing capital that later-stage European outfits could have raised abroad.

“There are lots of gems that are under the radar in Europe, that could be scaling into global champions, and that are not realizing their full potential.” He said DeepMind is a related example, “where they were missing this growth capital and sold too early.” (Google acquired the company for more than $500 million in 2014, but it is now estimated to be worth billions.)

Keeping European companies European has gained urgency in many verticals that overlap with Kembara’s thesis, such as quantum computing, semiconductors, and space tech. But its goal is to foster global champions that cross borders. Coincidentally, Kembara means “to wander” in Malaysian (although the team holds “the humble path to excellence” as an older meaning).

Beyond the name, Kembara has Malaysian connections. Santiso is also the former CEO for Europe of Malaysian sovereign wealth fund Khazanah; and doors could open as many countries examine their exposure to the U.S. “In the second close, we’re going to be looking for global investors, because we want to have global access to markets, but also global access to supply chain,” de Vries said.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Anthropic and OpenAI may be rivals, but their presidents Daniela Amodei and Gregory Brockman have one thing in common: they are both Stripe alumni. With former employees who went on to create dozens of startups, the fintech company has become one of the most prolific “founder factories” — and the money is following. The latest example: business identity verification startup Duna, which just raised a €30 million Series A to become the best-funded European member of the so-called “Stripe mafia.” The funding round was led by Alphabet’s growth fund CapitalG, which has also backed Stripe since co-leading its Series D in 2016.

Based in Germany and the Netherlands, Duna was co-founded by Stripe alumni Duco van Lanschot and David Schreiber. With customers including Plaid, the startup helps fintech companies onboard business customers more efficiently, reducing the typical churn associated with corporate ID checks and other fraud prevention measures.

Stripe is not a customer of Duna, van Lanschot said, but its executives were well placed to understand the opportunity that the startup is seizing, which is reflected in its cap table. The company’s angel investors include former Stripe executives David Singleton (CTO), Claire Hughes Johnson (COO) and Michael Cocoman (Global Chief Compliance Officer). Even Stripe rival Adyen got involved, with CRCO Mariëtte Swart and CFO Ethan Tandowsky joining as angels.

Their endorsements also validate van Lanschot’s hunch that these companies won’t compete with Duna, even though they could. “It requires such fine-grained controls that change on a company-by-company basis, that an Adyen or a Stripe isn’t going to spin out their business onboarding as a separate product where another enterprise customer can change all of the configurations,” he told TechCrunch.

If it’s still worth the effort for Duna, it’s because the startup is going after the long tail of enterprise clients that don’t have huge resources to dedicate to business onboarding. But it’s also because its vision doesn’t stop there: Duna’s ambition is to build a network that allows companies to reuse their verified identity information across multiple platforms.

“What we want to build over time is a global trust infrastructure where we provide a digital passport for every business. So you can reuse your file from onboarding on [German spend management platform] Moss to onboard with Plaid, or you can reuse it to open up a bank account,” van Lanschot said.

This goal resonated with Alex Nichols, the general partner who led CapitalG’s investment into the Series A. “I would say the common thing I look for in my investments are some sort of network effects, or more formal scale advantage,” he told TechCrunch. “I also love it when founders have an earned insight about a problem they may not know about otherwise, and this is a very good example of that,” he added.

Duna has competitors in the category known as KYB, or Know Your Business. This includes vendors such as Jumio and Veriff. But for Nichols, what sets Duna apart is its decision to generate its own data, rather than trying to aggregate existing data sources that are often lacking. “It’s the rare opportunity to rebuild something as foundational as a Visa and create an amazing business in the process.”

Duna says it has already found a strong business case in helping customers onboard corporate users faster and cheaper. This also explains why existing investors are doubling down: Index Ventures, which led Duna’s €10.7 million seed round in May 2025, participated in the Series A, as did Puzzle Ventures and Snowflake chairman Frank Slootman. But the startup’s bigger ambition won’t pay off until Duna reaches significant scale. So the company is looking for shortcuts.

How so? Van Lanschot and the Duna team are identifying small clusters of companies that already overlap with each other — what they call “patches of networks.” These include manufacturing companies with shared customers, investment firms with overlapping LPs, or companies in the same small country. In these tight-knit groups, the ability to reuse verification becomes valuable immediately, even before Duna achieves full network effects.

The countries may be small, but the opportunity is big, van Lanschot said. “In the Netherlands alone — a tiny, tiny country — the four biggest banks employ 14,000 people in compliance, and half of them are working on businesses.” CapitalG later clarified that 13,000 people work on compliance across all Dutch banks. Either way, Duna won’t fully replace these jobs yet, but AI automation can save costs and generate revenue even before the network effects kick in.

If Duna eventually provides the rails for an identity network, there might be an even bigger opportunity in taking advantage of this position to enable one-click business onboarding. This would make it akin to Amazon’s one-click checkout — or closer to B2B, to Stripe Link. Once again with Duna, the Stripe connection is never really far.

This story was updated to correct the name and title of one of Duna’s angel investors, and to add a clarification on the number of people employed in compliance in the Netherlands.

            <h2>America’s Future With Measles Is Hanging in the Balance</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-02-05</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/2026/02/measles-vaccination-rebound-when/685889/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Since measles vaccination became common among Americans, the logic of outbreaks has been simple: When vaccination rates fall, infections rapidly rise; when vaccination rates increase, cases abate. The United States is currently living out the first half of that maxim.

Measles-vaccination rates have been steadily declining for several years; since last January, the country has logged its two largest measles epidemics in more than three decades. The second of those, still ballooning in South Carolina, is over 875 cases and counting. In April, measles may be declared endemic in the U.S. again, 26 years after elimination.

When and if the maxim’s second part—a rebound in vaccination—might manifest “is the key question,” Paul Offit, a pediatrician and vaccine expert at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, told me. Experts anticipate a shift eventually. Vaccine coverage has often been beholden to a kind of homeostatic pull, in which it dips and then ricochets in response to death and suffering. In 2022, for instance, in the weeks after polio paralyzed an unvaccinated man in Rockland County, New York, the families of more than 1,000 under-vaccinated children heeded advice to immunize.

During past outbreaks, though, health authorities at local, state, and federal levels have given that same advice—vaccinate, now—loudly, clearly, and persistently. In 2026, the U.S. is facing the possibility of more and bigger measles outbreaks, as federal leaders have actively shrunk vaccine access, dismissed vaccine experts, and sowed doubts about vaccine benefits. Under these conditions, many experts are doubtful that facing down more disease, even its worst consequences, will convince enough Americans that more protection is necessary.

After the first major rash of measles cases appeared in and around West Texas about this time last year, many local families did rush to get vaccines, including early doses for infants; some families living near South Carolina’s outbreak, now bigger than West Texas’s was, have opted into free vaccination clinics too. Even in states far from these epidemics, such as Wisconsin, health-care providers have seen an uptick in vaccination, Jonathan Temte, a family-medicine physician and vaccine-policy expert at the University of Wisconsin at Madison, told me. But, he said, those boosts in interest have been concentrated primarily among people already enthusiastic about vaccination, who were seeking additional protection as the national situation worsened. At the same time, many of South Carolina’s free vaccination clinics have been poorly attended; some community members hit by the worst of the outbreak in West Texas have stood by their decision to not vaccinate.

Protection against measles has always been fragile: Sky-high levels of vaccination—at rates of at least 92 to 95 percent—are necessary to stave off outbreaks. And after holding steady for years, uptake of the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine has been dropping unevenly in communities scattered across the U.S. since around the start of the coronavirus pandemic, pulling down the nationwide average. Recent research from a team led by Eric Geng Zhou, a health economist at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, has found that, although many communities in the Northeast and Midwest have generally high MMR-vaccine uptake, others in regions such as West Texas, southern New Mexico, and the rural Southeast, as well as parts of Mississippi, don’t have much protection to speak of.

COVID can bear some of the blame for these patches of slipping vaccination. It disrupted families’ routine of visits to the pediatrician, leading to delayed or missed vaccinations. Those interruptions quickly resolved for some families, Zhou told me, but they remained for many others, lagging, for instance, among people of lower socioeconomic status who are less likely to have consistent access to health care and reliable health information. At the same time, the pandemic deepened political divides over public-health policies, including vaccination. In the years since, Republicans have become substantially more hesitant than Democrats about immunizing their children. “The COVID pandemic created this persistent divergence,” Zhou told me.

Pockets with under-vaccinated people have always existed, tracking alongside groups that are less likely to engage with all kinds of medical care, including people with less education or lower income, or those who belong to certain ethnic minorities. Anti-vaccine activists—including Robert F. Kennedy Jr., now the secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services—have also spent years spreading misinformation about the vaccine. But maybe most crucial, vaccination status clusters in communities—depending intimately on whether, for instance, children are raised by parents who are themselves vaccinated. The net effect of COVID, misinformation, and changing political tides is that the chasms between the vaccinated and unvaccinated have widened, an especially dangerous proposition for measles, a virus that is estimated to infect 90 percent of the unimmunized people it encounters.

Last year, as measles ignited in West Texas, some experts wondered whether attitudes about the MMR vaccine might shift once the virus killed someone. Since the start of 2025, three unvaccinated people have died from measles, two of them young children. But because that outbreak centered on several rural Mennonite communities that have long been distrustful of vaccines, many Americans seem to have treated those three deaths as a mostly isolated problem, Noel Brewer, a vaccine-behavior expert at the University of North Carolina Gillings School of Global Public Health, told me. (Brewer was a member of the CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices before Kennedy overhauled the group entirely last year.)

More broadly, the disease still has a misleading reputation as harmless enough that “it’s not a big deal if you get it,” Rupali Limaye, a vaccine-behavior expert at Johns Hopkins University, told me. But even if measles’ severe outcomes were more common, Limaye and others were doubtful that many more Americans would be moved to act. COVID vaccines still offer protection against the disease’s worst outcomes, yet so far this winter, just 17 percent of adults and 8 percent of children have gotten a COVID shot. And although the seasonal flu typically hospitalizes hundreds of thousands of people in the U.S. each year, tens of thousands of whom die, flu-vaccine uptake regularly hovers below 50 percent. For measles, “how many deaths is enough to be a tipping point?” Offit asked. “I don’t know that.”  If anything, the nation’s top health officials have encouraged people to embrace the tolls of infectious illness. The Trump administration responded to the deaths last year with relatively tepid messages about the benefits of measles vaccines—which are excellent at preventing severe illness, infection, and transmission—all while promoting nutritional supplementation with vitamin A. More recently, CDC’s new principal deputy director, Ralph Abraham, described the prospect of measles becoming endemic in the U.S. as “just the cost of doing business.” Last month, CDC ended long-standing recommendations urging all Americans to receive an annual flu shot; later that week, Kennedy told CBS News that it may be a “better thing” if fewer kids get vaccinated against the flu. And Kirk Milhoan, the new chair of CDC’s vaccine advisory committee, recently questioned the need for the MMR vaccine, arguing that measles’ risks may now be lower than they once were, in part because hospitals are better equipped to treat the disease than they used to be.

When reached for comment over email, Andrew G. Nixon, the deputy assistant secretary for media relations at HHS, disputed the notion that the department has hindered the country’s response to measles, writing, “Under Secretary Kennedy, CDC surged resources and multiple states declared measles outbreaks over in 2025.” He added that “Secretary Kennedy and other leaders at HHS have consistently said that vaccination is the best way to prevent the spread of measles.”

The counsel of health-care providers, not federal health officials, remains a top predictor of whether people will immunize. But when vaccine uptake has wavered in the past, governments have been key to buoying those levels again. In the 1970s, for example, after safety concerns about a whooping-cough vaccine—later proved false—plummeted rates of uptake in the United Kingdom and spurred a series of major outbreaks, an eventual government-sponsored campaign helped limit the dip in vaccination to a few years. In the 2010s, rising rates of families seeking nonmedical exemptions for vaccination in California helped precipitate the state’s Disneyland measles outbreak, which spread to six other states, as well as Canada and Mexico; MMR-vaccination rates throughout California jumped above 95 percent only after new state legislation strengthened school mandates. And in the early 1990s, local health officials ended a Philadelphia measles epidemic—which by then had sickened at least 1,400 people and killed nine children—after they took the extreme step of getting a court order to compel community members to vaccinate children.

When governments withdraw support for vaccines, immunization rates can crater. In 2013, an unfounded safety concern about the HPV vaccine prompted Japanese health authorities to suspend strong national recommendations for the immunization; the move caused uptake among adolescent and young teenage girls to drop, from about 70 to 80 percent to less than 1 percent within a year, according to Brewer, who is co-authoring a research paper on the subject. Japan did not reinstate its HPV recommendation until nearly a decade later—and coverage has since recovered to only about half of its original baseline.

Nixon, the HHS spokesperson, wrote that the U.S. is now following the approach of peer nations that “achieve high vaccination rates without mandates by relying on trust, education, and strong doctor-patient relationships.” But Kennedy has also publicly discouraged people from “trusting the experts.” Limaye, who consults with local health-care providers, said that the biggest question that her contacts are now hearing from patient families is “Who am I supposed to believe?” Meanwhile, CDC’s website now contradicts the widespread and decades-long scientific consensus that vaccines don’t cause autism.

If MMR-vaccine uptake does rebound, experts suspect it will rise unevenly across the country, likely skirting the politically red regions where vaccination rates most urgently need to increase. In this way, the self-reinforcing nature of vaccination status is dangerous: Even while highly protected groups might double down on immunization, under-vaccinated groups can remain unprotected. Leaving enough places lingering below the crucial measles-vaccination threshold “will ensure repeated and large outbreaks,” Brewer said. West Texas and South Carolina were just the start; this year, measles will sicken more people, which means more deaths will follow, and likely soon. The Trump administration is testing how much resilience American vaccination rates have in the absence of federal support, and the answer emerging for measles so far is: not enough.</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Calling the Trump administration fascist has become a cliché, but some federal departments seem keen on the comparison. Consider the administration’s messaging on social media.

The Department of Homeland Security’s Facebook account recently posted a recruiting notice for ICE under the banner “WE’LL HAVE OUR HOME AGAIN”—the title of a white-nationalist anthem by the Pine Tree Riots (“By blood or sweat, we’ll get there yet”). The Department of Labor recently posted a video montage referencing American battle scenes under the tagline “One Homeland. One People. One Heritage. Remember who you are, American”—a slogan close to the Nazi-era Ein Volk, ein Reich, ein Führer.

Many of these posts borrow overtly from Christianity. In December, the DHS and White House accounts shared Christmas-themed posts celebrating mass deportations and encouraging self-deportation. One featured videos of armed agents performing night raids, with a caption quoting Matthew 5:9 in black-letter type: “Blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be called sons of God.”

Macho displays and transgressive memes mark a significant shift in how the federal government sees and promotes its mission—and sanctions state violence. It may be tempting to see this change as an organic or bottom-up phenomenon, as if federal agencies are appealing to Proud Boys to lure more ICE recruits. But the reality is that this transformation is the culmination of years of work by niche groups of conservative intellectuals who have long rejected America’s liberal traditions—and now dominate the halls of power.

There were signs from the start that a Trump-led GOP would reward transgression against liberal-democratic norms. In “The Flight 93 Election,” a September 2016 essay for the Claremont Institute, the former George W. Bush speechwriter Michael Anton called on fellow conservatives to “charge the cockpit” and vote for Trump in order to prevent a more dire outcome: the election of Hillary Clinton as president. Anton, who went on to serve on the National Security Council in Trump’s first term and the State Department in his second, used his polemic to decry Davos-style globalist pieties as “managerial Davoisie liberalism” and hail Trump’s plans to stop “importing poverty, crime, and alien cultures.” Trump, he allowed, “is worse than imperfect,” but this didn’t matter. Trump, Anton argued, offered a lifeline for an irrelevant conservative movement and a dying republic.

This call to arms scandalized many establishment conservatives, some of whom provided a check on Trump in his first term. Members of Trump’s first cabinet prevented him from ratcheting up his trade war, fully alienating allies, deploying U.S. troops to American cities, and withdrawing them suddenly from overseas.

After the “Unite the Right” rally turned deadly in Charlottesville, Virginia, in 2017, the alt-right appeared to lose steam. The White House chief strategist Steve Bannon fell from grace, the white nationalist Richard Spencer mostly vanished from the public eye, and controversial figures including Sebastian Gorka and Darren Beattie were ultimately ousted from the administration. Even Stephen Miller looked vulnerable for a time. Many conservatives assumed that the events of January 6, 2021, would rightfully prevent Trump from holding public office ever again.

Instead, January 6 came to signify the staying power of Trumpism, and offered a new rallying cry and loyalty test for a more radicalized GOP.

In October 2021, the Heritage Foundation tapped Kevin Roberts, the former CEO of the Trump-friendly Texas Public Policy Foundation, to be its next president—marking a change in orientation for one of Washington’s most influential conservative think tanks. At the National Conservatism Conference in 2022, Roberts declared his “fellowship with the principles” MAGA’s main intellectual movement had advanced “to rescue America from the barbarians inside the gates of our very own institutions.” At the same gathering, the natcon leader Yoram Hazony argued that Christian domination is the only safeguard against “the religion of woke neo-Marxism.”

Today, elite MAGA-world figures including Anton and Peter Thiel flirt openly with the idea of Caesarism, or a “Red Caesar,” whereby a lone authoritarian ruler might restore the country’s strength. “Postliberals” such as Patrick Deneen write about how “regime change” is possible only with a new elite—one that understands the value of “Machiavellian means to achieve Aristotelian ends.” The influential philosopher-blogger Curtis Yarvin has called for a total dismantling of “the cathedral,” by which he means the all-powerful liberal institutions at the center of modern life (universities, media outlets), which operate like a Church in that they dictate how people should think.

George Packer: An anatomy of the MAGA mind

What unifies these thinkers is a totalizing and conspiratorial conception of modern liberal politics. In this view, very little in the existing order is worth redeeming. Some even argue that the most patriotic way forward is simply to burn it all down.

All of this intellectual boundary-breaking can be intoxicating, especially against the backdrop of a wider culture that has at times tipped into stultifying speech codes and groupthink. But the rebellion has also spurred a race to the bottom. This is how a group chat among young Republicans devolves into talk of loving Hitler.

Richard Hanania, a political scientist who knows a good deal about such dynamics owing to the years he spent writing pseudonymously for alt-right and white-supremacist publications, calls this phenomenon the “based ritual.” Young ideologues compete to prove their fealty to MAGA by engaging in a kind of transgressive one-upmanship. In this performance, the risk of appearing racist or sexist is well outweighed by the risk of seeming disloyal to Trump.

Prominent conservatives have publicly discussed the value of shifting the Overton window. In 2023, Christopher Rufo hosted a debate about whether to broaden the tent to include racists and other extremists—a “no enemies to the right” strategy.

This is very much a live question. In October, after Tucker Carlson hosted the young white-nationalist influencer Nick Fuentes in a long and indulgent interview on his podcast, quite a few conservatives struggled to distance themselves from Fuentes without alienating other political allies. Roberts, at the Heritage Foundation, raised hackles when he initially defended Carlson. He then tried to split the difference by criticizing Fuentes but not Carlson, but still faced an exodus of staff and several resignations from the board of trustees for legitimizing extremism. Clearly some conservatives are still willing to hold the more radical factions of the party to account.

Jonathan Chait: The conservative movement’s intellectual collapse

Unfortunately, these traditional, more principled conservatives are not ascendant. In the early days of the Heritage fiasco, Harvard’s Adrian Vermeule, perhaps the most sophisticated thinker of the MAGA new right, warned against factional infighting when the enemy is “at the very gates.” What is notable here is that for Vermeule, the “enemies” are liberals. Such language handily buttresses Trump’s constant talk of the “enemy from within.” It’s a philosophy that allows the administration to portray liberal activists as domestic terrorists, and mass peaceful protests as “engineered chaos.”

That kind of edgelordism has become the currency du jour in the GOP, from the Ivy League through the streets of Minnesota. The MAGA new right seems to be betting that the American polity has a deep reserve of untapped nativist rage—which can be harnessed in the service of their culture war against the liberal status quo, or of ICE’s more tangible goals. But if current polls are to be believed, the administration seems to be underestimating the everyday decency and patriotism of the American public.

Boundary-pushing ideas can be invigorating, and opportunities to question and resist received wisdom are essential to any free and democratic society. But the pursuit of transgression for its own sake can easily derail sound judgment. The risk is in presuming that anything subversive or sensational is also true and meaningful, and that anything conventional is a lie that must be smashed down. That is a brutal way to inhabit the world—and, I hope, a losing one.

            <div id="article-text">On a frigid white January afternoon in 1982, an airplane took off from Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport for Florida, remained aloft for about 30 seconds, and then stalled out and collided with the 14th Street Bridge, plunging into the ice-floe-studded waters of the Potomac River. In The Washington Post’s newsroom, an aghast 24-year-old college-basketball reporter named Michael Wilbon watched live reports of the disaster on the mounted TV banks, heard the urgency among those around him, grabbed a notebook and his jacket, and ran toward the riverbank to report on the rescue efforts, because that was what he’d been schooled to do. He never got a byline—his name never appeared on the story.

Reminiscing in a phone call with me last night, Wilbon recalled that the old offices of the Post’s editors, at the newspaper’s former building on 15th Street, had glass walls inside—so on the night of the crash, he could see Ben Bradlee, the executive editor, and his deputies huddling. “They were meeting,” Wilbon remembered. “They kept meeting. So finally, I said, Well, let’s just fucking go.” Trailing Wilbon was another 20-something college-sports reporter named John Feinstein. They interviewed witnesses and rescuers, then hustled over to an old Marriott hotel at the Arlington mouth of the bridge, where they huddled by a phone reading their notes to someone in the office taking dictation. Feinstein, who died last year, didn’t get a byline either; cub reporters often didn’t. It was just what he’d been schooled to do. (He did become a best-selling author, though. Wilbon later got famous co-anchoring ESPN’s Pardon the Interruption.)

For some years now, the Washington Post newsroom has defied gravity, thanks to the internal ethic just described. Usually, when people in an office distrust feckless leaders, when they are subjected to corporate verbiage that bounces off the face and leaves a rage headache behind—phrases such as reevaluating our model and reposition, used to obscure the catastrophic fact that approximately 300 jobs, or a third of the newsroom, have been “eliminated” (the contemptible formulation by which Post staffers were laid off today)—they will subtly gear down their efforts. But my former colleagues do the opposite. For every half-wit decision by a poseur in a 42-long, slim-fit suit, they report even harder. This ethic has been especially true in the renowned Sports section, which was killed in a Zoom announcement notable for its belly-wriggling cowardice and self-owning incompetence. The Post’s publisher, Will Lewis, and its executive editor, Matt Murray, apparently did not have enough brace in their back to face the newsroom in person.

The Post Sports section is, was, no ordinary section, in heritage or in coverage. It was habitually young, because it required hiring people with no sense of off-the-clockness: Events happen at nights and on weekends, on tough deadlines that require sprinting stadium stairs and downing a pack of smoked almonds for a late dinner. Donald Graham, the Post’s longtime publisher, spent time as Sports editor when he was learning the family trade. His Sports successor, George Solomon, liked to spot good young talent cheap and let us run—and ran us ragged. “Hey,” he said to me once during a hectic NFL season, “I need you to stop in Green Bay on your way home from Dallas.”

We moved in a close group. Every two years, eight or 10 of us would fly off to the Olympics in some international city. For two and a half weeks, we’d have a choice between eating and sleeping; the deadlines didn’t allow for both. We reported shoulder to shoulder in narrow press pens in stadium bowels so dank and sweaty that, as my ex-colleague Barry Svrluga has said, “it’s like working inside someone’s mouth.”

At the Beijing Summer Olympics, in 2008, we were so exhausted from the round-the-clock work that we threw blankets and sheets over a table to make a tent and stuck a pillow on the floor beneath it. You could crawl in there and catch a nap. We named it “the Happy Place,” and when someone was sleeping, we’d put stick-’em notes on their clothes—I once drew a picture of a gas gauge with the needle on empty and stuck it on a colleague—and take pictures of them. When deadline was finally over, at 3 a.m., we’d entertain ourselves with a liquored-up singing game that our colleague Liz Clarke named “Stupid-Guy Anthems.” In Sochi, we learned a Russian hockey anthem from a couple of young guys running an all-night café. At the end of every Olympics, our editor Tracee Hamilton would crack open a Guinness and recite the St. Crispin’s Day speech from Henry V, about “we happy few.” We laughed so hard that the New York Times staffers sitting in their office beyond a plywood wall would shush us—for which we would toss pencils at them.

We came from all over, competed desperately to outwrite one another, teased one another mercilessly, loved one another. One day, Feinstein said to John Ed Bradley, our mellow-voiced football writer from Louisiana, “Hey, John Ed, did you marry your huntin’ dog Red yet?” I loved to kid my desk-mate Christine Brennan, who was from Toledo, “Hey, Chris, what’d you do for fun yesterday? Leave the butter out overnight?”

We had the best writers in the country and did more with less, and we knew it with a swagger. In addition to Wilbon and Feinstein, Solomon found a young writer named David Remnick, who once wrote of the basketball player George Gervin that he was “sinuous as smoke.” That was before Remnick got an urge to become a foreign correspondent and went off to win a Pulitzer covering the demise of the Soviet Union—it was what he’d been schooled to do. (Eventually, he became the editor of The New Yorker.)

Remnick was trained by Solomon, as we all were, to grab the pen and go, and to regard sportswriting as merely another portal through which to report on the broadest subjects: labor issues, performance enhancement, domestic violence, racism, sexism, terrorism, global corruptions such as vote-buying in the Olympics. Journalism as Solomon, Graham, Bradlee, and others had taught us didn’t change with the subject. And it was an ethic as much as a job, about responsibility to other people. “If you’re late, we’re all late,” Solomon told me. “If you’re wrong, we’re all wrong.” Not a bad way to mature an unfinished young person.

The Washington Post’s sportswriters could cover anything—and did—because we were taught to look with a hard eye, write vividly and observationally, and hit our deadlines no matter what, which made other section bosses always want us. Remnick was just one of the earliest examples of the Sports section turning out great foreign and national correspondents. Isabelle Khurshudyan, a hockey writer, won honors covering the war in Ukraine and became the Post’s Kyiv bureau chief. Chico Harlan, a baseball writer, became a foreign bureau chief in East Asia and then Rome. Eli Saslow, a sports feature writer, went on to win a Pulitzer writing about American poverty. David Nakamura, a college-sports writer, broke stories about poisoned drinking water in Washington, D.C.; corresponded from Afghanistan and Pakistan; and now covers the Justice Department.

In 2011, Rick Maese, a sports feature writer, went to Japan on vacation with his wife, the Metro staffer Erin Cox. While they were there, an earthquake hit, followed by a tsunami, followed by a nuclear meltdown. They spent their trip covering the Fukushima disaster. The baseball writer Chelsea Janes, like me, also covered presidential campaigns; the plundering of our staff by National editors was a continual irritant to our Sports bosses, though they were proud of us.

The now-retired Liz Clarke wrote a memorable magazine story about Bruce Springsteen and spent years doggedly investigating the Washington Commanders owner Dan Snyder for allowing a culture of sexual harassment and assault to fester within the team office; after Clarke and her fellow reporter Will Hobson finally chased down the story and got it into print, the fallout eventually forced Snyder to sell.

Clarke, a North Carolinian, worked with a gentle singing voice with which she asked the toughest questions of NFL billionaires. I liked to imitate her talking with an NFL owner this way: “Of course, a role as lofty as yours does come with certain prerogatives of judgment,” she’d say with a soft smile. “But I wonder if it might not be the smallest misstep and breed the teeniest bit of mistrust in the team to go with a quarterback who thinks hydration is tequila and ranch water?”

In addition to writing political profiles, I was recruited to cover the September 11 attacks in New York—I stuck my driver’s license and a $20 bill in my sock and ran all the way downtown—as well as two hurricanes. Right after Katrina struck the Gulf Coast, I stood in front of a huge map in the newsroom with the editors Liz Spayd and Phil Bennett, who were trying to decide exactly where to send me. After a pause, Bennett said, “Texas is big.” We settled on Mississippi. I met up with the photographer Jonathan Newton, a hurricane veteran who had pallets of water and gas cans strapped down in an SUV, as well as a boxful of cigarillos. He handed me one. We smoked them to kill the smells.

Only the people who live their work in a newsroom will understand this: One of the best things I ever tasted was shots of Maker’s Mark, neat, shared in a Mississippi motel parking lot at 1 a.m. with Newton and other photographers, out of a makeshift bar in the back of an SUV. We’d spent the day covering the damage that Katrina, with its 26-foot wall of water and 160-mile-per-hour winds, had wrought—had seen boats on freeway medians and a piano in a treetop at Jefferson Davis’s old home—and our dinner was whiskey and fried pickles, and it was good. We shared a room at a Hampton Inn where the door wouldn’t lock because the floods had ruined the electronics, and we brushed our teeth together.

You’d think a newspaper that has so botched its finances, and that is trying to do more with less, could use people with such ethic and versatility. “We should have been the last ones in the room,” Wilbon told me last night.

One of the most valuable things lost with the killing of the Sports section will be the Post’s sense of proper training of the young. After I covered my first Army-Navy game, the great columnist Thomas Boswell took me to dinner and talked writing. My first Olympics was the Calgary Games in 1988, and I wrote well out of sheer excitement. When I got home, the columnist Tony Kornheiser, now Wilbon’s longtime Pardon the Interruption co-host, told me, “You did great. But listen. This is your level now, all the time. You don’t retreat from this level.” I did 10 Olympics for the Post. At the Athens Games, in 2004, I took pleasure in watching the young Svrluga lift his own writing game out of sheer excitement. “This is your level now,” I told him. “You don’t retreat from it.”

That’s who we were, and who we are. I say “we” because I left The Washington Post for The Atlantic five months ago, after 30 years at the paper, and I still have the reflexes and the friends. I also feel an anger at the demise of the Sports section—about 40 of 45 people fired, the rest thrown to other sections—that cannot be extinguished, and that only grows as more details emerge. This superb section was treated the following way:

The Post’s Olympics writers were notified just 10 days ago, right before some of them were scheduled to depart for the Milan Games, that their coverage was canceled—with little explanation. Just 36 hours later, management reversed itself and quietly suggested: Well, okay, four writers could go, but with the understanding that they could be laid off during the assignment. This is the sort of managerial aimlessness the Post is being governed by, just one example of the missteps and squandering of opportunity framed as strategy.

The Olympics writers were given a choice: If laid off, they could either fly home or finish the assignment. “I know what they’ll do,” the Sports editor Jason Murray told me on the phone last night. “I know who they are.” They will finish the assignment. Svrluga, the most knowledgeable Olympics writer in the country, who has been “eliminated,” filed a comprehensive story on Mikaela Shiffrin while knowing that the knife was at his neck. This morning, I texted him: “Will you keep filing from there?” I got a one-word answer.

Another of those laid off was the deputy Sports editor, Matt Rennie, a quarter-century veteran of the paper who happens to be the single finest thinker and pencil-wielder I have ever worked with at any level. Rennie cleared out his desk Monday and last night without a single piece of straight information from leadership about his fate; he simply assumed that he was laid off because no one said anything to him, and no one stopped him, either. At home, he wrote a note to colleagues that hit the nail on the head: “The people making these decisions have failed in their responsibility to our readers, whom they never took the time to know, and have undermined—likely irreparably—the ideals of an institution they never bothered to try to understand.” These moves, he added, “ultimately, will power the Post’s competitors.” The best Sports section that ever was has been destroyed by people who failed to even notice what a jewel they had.

Anne Applebaum: Readers don’t trust dirty tricks

The irony in this situation is that Will Lewis and Matt Murray have rendered themselves unemployable anywhere else (who would have them after this?), whereas Post Sports staffers will no doubt be much in demand. As Rennie wrote to his colleagues, “Whenever and wherever we land—and we will—we’ll be comin’. And hell is comin’ with us.”

I disagree with Rennie about just one thing: I’m not sure the damage to the Post is irreparable. Jeff Bezos, its billionaire owner, only thinks he owns the Post, and Lewis and Murray only think they run it. At the heart of the institution is something that no one can ever own: the Wilbonian core trained into all of us, an impulse to run to the riverbank that these bumbling strangers who have hobbled the publication will never grasp.</div>

            <h2>Why Trump Wants a Weaker Dollar</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-02-04</strong></p>

The U.S. dollar is getting weaker, and that’s just how the president wants it. During an appearance last Tuesday at the Machine Shed Restaurant in Urbandale, Iowa, Donald Trump told reporters that the dollar’s declining exchange rate was “great.”

Trump understands that a weak dollar doesn’t sound good. In his first term, he tweeted, “As your President, one would think that I would be thrilled with our very strong dollar. I am not!” His logic is that the relatively weak currencies of America’s foreign competitors, such as China and Japan, can make their goods cheaper in international markets, and that the United States would do well to replicate their strategy. This theory isn’t unfounded—a weak dollar would boost the economy in certain respects—but the president’s unpredictable foreign-policy and global-trade decisions are threatening to erode America’s economic standing abroad in a far more significant way.

When Trump talks about the relative strength or weakness of the dollar, he’s talking about its value in foreign-exchange markets. When the dollar index plunged 1.3 percent last Tuesday, that meant the dollar lost 1.3 percent of its value relative to a group of competing currencies, making some foreign goods a little more expensive to import. It did not mean that your dollar was immediately worth 1.3 percent less at the grocery store (although costlier imports do somewhat counteract the president’s affordability agenda).

That’s partly why, despite some mixed messaging after he took office in 2017, Trump has been fixated on a weak dollar for much of his adult life: In 1987, he took out full-page ads in The New York Times, The Washington Post, and The Boston Globe lamenting the dollar’s strength against the weakness of Japan’s “brilliantly” managed yen. A weaker dollar makes American companies and American goods more competitive abroad. Theoretically, the incentive to export and the disincentive to import could push companies to invest in domestic manufacturing—bringing back factory jobs and providing one potential path to the president’s long-held goal of squashing the trade deficit.

It’s typically pretty hard for American presidents to unilaterally effect a long-term change in the dollar’s exchange rate. Kenneth Rogoff, formerly the chief economist of the International Monetary Fund, told me that because the exchange rate is governed by so many different factors, the president wishing for a weaker dollar is “like doing a rain dance.” One of those factors is interest-rate policy—which is why the Federal Reserve usually has far more influence over the dollar’s value than the president does. When borrowing costs go down, the dollar index also tends to go down. Part of the reason Trump is so keen on exerting greater control over the Fed is its power over the value of money.

Although Trump hopes a weaker dollar will boost American exports, he’s also taking steps that could more than offset any gains. His mercurial policies are now threatening to push away some of America’s long-standing trading partners. Since the end of World War II, the U.S. dollar has been by far the world’s most dominant currency: Banks around the world tend to lend and borrow in dollars; many transactions that don’t touch America are conducted in dollars; and nearly 90 percent of trades on foreign-exchange markets happen by way of dollars. Our money has historically been attractive because it is stable. The dominance of U.S. currency throughout the 20th century was deeply connected to this country’s status as a global superpower, free from erratic dictators and seemingly unable to default on its debts.

This has afforded us what the former French Finance Minister Valéry Giscard d’Estaing once called our “exorbitant privilege.” As long as the dollar remains dominant, the U.S. has the edge on all other countries when it comes to borrowing, running gargantuan deficits, and imposing sanctions. Last spring’s “Liberation Day” tariffs were an expression of that exorbitant privilege—a way to strong-arm some of our allies. On April 10, a week after the plan was announced, the dollar dropped by about 2 percent. As my colleague Annie Lowrey put it at the time, those tariffs raised questions about “whether the United States deserves to have its privilege revoked.”

A weaker U.S. dollar isn’t necessarily a less dominant dollar. Many have prophesied the end of the dollar’s supremacy, and yet it remains on top. Part of the reason that the currency’s dominance is so hard to shake is that it’s self-perpetuating: Why use something else when so many people, companies, and nations are already using dollars? None of the economists I spoke with suggested that the dollar is in real danger of losing its hegemony, at least not in the near term. And the euro, yen, yuan, and so-called digital gold—bitcoin—are all for various reasons ill-equipped for dominance. (Actual gold, which thrives in times of global insecurity, is having a moment.)

But the president’s distaste for global institutions (such as NATO and the World Health Organization), for existing treaties, and for the alliances the U.S. has enjoyed since World War II has given international-trading partners plenty of reasons to worry about America’s stability. Maurice Obstfeld, another former IMF chief economist, told me that even if no clear successor to the dollar presents itself, “with enough inner geopolitical chaos caused by Trump, and geo-economic chaos, the dollar’s reach would shrink, and the reach of other currencies would rise.” A less dominant dollar would be a particularly dramatic indication of America’s waning status abroad.

The real trouble, in other words, is not that the dollar’s value is getting weaker. It’s the possibility that America’s allies and trading partners may one day cease to respect it.

Here are three new stories from The Atlantic:

Early in my career, a mother came to my office to discuss her daughter’s calculus grade. When parents make this kind of request, I try to manage expectations by saying that as a school administrator, I have never changed a grade. Still, hopeful parents persist. In this case, the student had received a B, which her mother saw as a blemish on her otherwise spotless transcript. “I’m worried about how this will look to colleges,” she told me. “Is there any extra credit she can do?”

I explained that it’s okay to earn a B in a challenging course, and that her daughter might benefit from the experience of not being perfect. The mother looked at me as if I had suggested her child take up base jumping. “She’s never gotten a B before,” she said. “I don’t know how she’ll handle it.”

That kind of exchange perfectly captures a paradox of contemporary parenting: In trying to protect their children from any hint of failure, many parents risk making them more fragile.

Explore. American milk has more fat than ever, Sarah Zhang writes.

Reflect. Catherine O’Hara brought humanity to over-the-top characters—and managed to wink at the audience in the process, Paula Mejía writes.

            <h2>It Was Too Easy for Eileen Mihich to Kill Herself</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-02-04</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/2026/02/eileen-mihich-assisted-suicide/685833/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The four-star Hotel deLuxe in Portland, Oregon, features a soaring lobby with a gilded ceiling that drips with chandeliers. Eileen Mihich, a 31-year-old woman from nearby Beaverton, checked in on the afternoon of March 6, 2025. Two days later, a hotel employee named Stephen Jones noticed that Mihich had failed to check out at the appointed time and went to her eighth-floor room to investigate. No one answered, and the room was silent behind the door, so he let himself in. He found Mihich dead on the bed, with purpling skin. Jones immediately called the police, who noted the empty pill bottles at Mihich’s bedside, along with a pamphlet: “Step-by-Step Instructions for Taking Aid in Dying Medications.”

Mihich had told her family that she was debilitated by a mysterious abdominal pain and was interested in a medically assisted death. But her suicide still shocked her two closest relatives: her cousin Sarah (who asked to be referred to by her first name, to protect her privacy) and aunt Veronica Torina. Sarah and Torina told me that they had striven to be sources of love and stability in Mihich’s harrowing life. Nearly a year on, they are still trying to solve the mystery of her death.

After Sarah and Torina heard the news about Mihich, they went to the hotel to pick up some of her belongings, including a backpack with library-rental DVDs of Matilda and Mister Rogers’ Neighborhood, as well as a book on spirituality. At the medical examiner’s office weeks later, they received her phone, her wallet, and pharmacy receipts for prescription drugs commonly used to end the lives of patients with untreatable illnesses.

They also learned that Mihich’s body bore no signs of illness. Mihich had been suffering, but she had not been on the verge of death.

Medical assistance in dying—a euphemism for physician-enabled suicide—has been gaining legislative ground in jurisdictions around the country. Twelve states and Washington, D.C., allow doctors to prescribe lethal dosages of medications to patients with terminal illnesses, and a new law takes effect in New York this year. Most Americans now favor laws that allow doctors to assist patients who want to die, and their numbers have grown over time, according to Gallup. In Canada, where the practice has been legal since 2016, physician-assisted suicide now accounts for about one in 20 deaths.

From the September 2025 issue: Canada is killing itself

For both advocates and opponents of this medically and culturally sanctioned form of suicide, Mihich’s story is a nightmare. The policy debate over medical assistance in dying generally concerns statutory changes, but new laws are encouraging a shift in social norms. When some people in severe distress imagine a peaceful end to what feels like unbearable pain, the availability of medical assistance in dying may shape their thinking, and current safeguards do not seem sufficient to prevent tragic outcomes.

Torina suspects that her niece would still be alive had it been just a little harder for her to secure lethal medication. “She didn’t really want to die, but she felt that she was powerless to create a life worth living. She mentioned that to me on more than one occasion,” Torina told me. Studies show that even minor barriers to suicide, such as selling pills in blister packs and limiting the amount of analgesics that can be sold over the counter, may deter people from ending their life, perhaps because they introduce delays into what can be a rash act. Shortly before her death, Mihich had ordered eye shadow online, which arrived after she was gone. “She was showing signs that she did want to live,” Torina said.

Mihich had been mentally ill for a long time, her relatives said, and she had needed many things that life did not supply her. An only child of negligent parents, Mihich identified with the Roald Dahl character Matilda, a precocious schoolgirl who learns to fend for herself against sometimes cruel adults. Mihich’s parents had screaming fights in front of her, Sarah and Torina recalled, and Mihich alleged that her father, who had been diagnosed with schizophrenia, had raped her when she was a teenager. (Mihich did not pursue the allegations in court, and her father did not respond to multiple requests for comment. Her mother declined to comment.)

After bouncing from foster home to foster home, Mihich was 15 when she fled her last foster parent and arrived on Torina’s doorstep, asking to be taken in. Torina obliged. Mihich’s psychiatrist eventually diagnosed her with bipolar disorder and borderline-personality disorder, the symptoms of which were so severe that she struggled to hold down a job or a home. She vacated one apartment because, Torina recalled, she felt that it emanated negative energy.

Mihich’s relatives said that she often refused to take the medication prescribed to treat her bipolar disorder, and that she nursed semi-delusional beliefs about her capacity to heal herself. She lived on Social Security Disability Insurance and was occasionally homeless. Mihich sometimes told her family about mysterious pains she felt in her pelvic area. Torina wondered whether this was Mihich’s way of expressing the depredations she had suffered as a woman.

Disappointed with mainstream health care, Mihich sought help from energy healers, spiritualists, and other alternative-medicine practitioners and entrepreneurs, who regularly supported her aversion to psychiatric medications, according to Sarah and Torina. All the while, Mihich repeatedly told her family that her pain was so great, she did not want to live. “She would tell me often that she couldn’t do it anymore,” Torina said. “She was too traumatized and broken” to keep on living.

Sarah and Torina understood why Mihich had decided to die. Once her toxicology report came back, they also knew which medications she had used to kill herself. Many of the drugs prescribed for medical assistance in dying are not commonly thought of as vulnerable to abuse. But when death is a possibility, minor errors can have catastrophic consequences.

To understand just how Mihich had secured these medications, Sarah turned to Mihich’s phone. Reviewing her incoming and outgoing calls in the days leading up to her death, Sarah found that Mihich had been in touch with multiple hospice coordinators and loan agencies, as well as a Washington State pharmacist who runs a compounding pharmacy out of a gift shop. Posing as a California family-practice physician under an assumed name, Mihich requested a prescription order form over email, then completed the paperwork and emailed it back—a method of submitting prescriptions that is illegal in Washington and elsewhere, in most cases. She then asked that the pharmacist coordinate via text with her “patient,” and gave her own phone number.

Ultimately Mihich was able to carry out her fraud with publicly available information and relative ease. Unlike conventional pharmacies, which sell only FDA-approved pharmaceuticals, compounding pharmacies are able to sell customized formulations that are not FDA tested and approved.

From the June 2023 issue: The outer limits of liberalism

Compounding pharmacies are the only places capable of dispensing medications that allow for a more peaceful death, as this involves mixing various sedatives, painkillers, and muscle relaxants into something more easily ingested and absorbed. Yet few pharmacists agree to supply these drugs, largely for ethical reasons. Jess Kaan, a Washington-based doctor who works with people seeking end-of-life care, told me that many of her patients have trouble finding a pharmacy that sells this medication, which can make such transactions particularly lucrative for those that do. The drugs Mihich bought cost a little over $2,500, based on her prescription forms, which she likely paid for out of pocket, given regulations that ban the use of federal funds such as Medicaid to cover costs associated with physician-assisted suicide.

To better understand how a pharmacy could have accepted her cousin’s suspicious and invalid prescription, Sarah filed a police report in May. This investigation is ongoing. The pharmacist who supplied Mihich with the drugs that killed her did not respond to requests for comment.

Sarah and Torina knew that Mihich was suffering emotionally and that she had been seeking more permanent relief. But they had assumed that Mihich’s talk of suicide was a way for her to express her misery, not something she was actively pursuing. Torina said they had assumed that Mihich’s aversion to suffering “any more pain” would deter her from making good on any plans. For example, they knew that she had considered starving herself, and that she had acquired a gun explicitly to shoot herself, but that she’d had trouble following through with either method. (They are not sure how she bought the gun.)

Instead, Mihich turned to a suicide approach that is advertised as a dignified way to alleviate pain. Mihich likely did not know that the drugs used to medically induce death do not necessarily guarantee a peaceful exit. In Oregon, where medical assistance in dying has been legal for nearly 30 years, the state’s Health Authority reported in 2024 that the drugs can cause side effects, including seizures, regurgitation, and regaining consciousness after an initial sedation. We can’t know for sure what Mihich experienced, because she died alone.

What we do know is that Mihich found a network of support in her pursuit of a medically assisted death. Her relatives discovered a message on her phone left by a representative of a naturopathic health company called Temple Natural Health, who explained that she had found “a way forward” after discussing Mihich’s case with a hospice-care organization called A Sacred Passing. The message did not include details, and the company did not respond to requests for comment. A representative of A Sacred Passing confirmed that the organization had responded to Mihich’s request for help in seeking medical assistance in dying with “a list of things to do” to get legal medical support—“the ways to reach out and locations to call.” The representative added that she stayed on the phone with Mihich because she sensed that the caller was struggling and needed someone to talk to, but that she didn’t think Mihich would qualify for a medically assisted death.

Eager to bring attention to the loopholes and lapses in judgment that helped end Mihich’s life, Sarah and Torina reached out to a number of organizations that advocate for medical assistance in dying, including the nonprofit Death With Dignity, but received no response. They had more luck when they contacted Aging With Dignity, a nonprofit that advocates against the practice and offers resources to people facing end-of-life problems. This group has worked with Sarah and Torina to create a video about Mihich that helps share her story.

Mihich’s method of suicide was clearly illegal in Oregon, Washington, and elsewhere in the United States, where medical assistance in death is available only to adult patients who are terminally ill, have six months or less to live, and are mentally capable of making their own health-care decisions. But her ability to access fatal drugs is concerning, as the spread of laws allowing medical assistance in dying makes it likely that incidents like this will happen again.

Mihich’s case also raises pressing questions about whether access to an assisted death should extend to people with persistent and severe mental illness—a category of disease that may not be terminal but can be debilitatingly painful. Patients who are suffering from severe psychiatric disorders can already legally seek medical help to end their life elsewhere, including in Belgium, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, and, beginning as soon as 2027, Canada. Yet establishing which psychiatric patients are worthy of this assistance has proved complicated. Authorities in Canada are weighing the case of Claire Brosseau, a 48-year-old woman with severe mental illness who hopes to secure medical help in ending her life but whose own psychiatrists are split over whether her illness is indeed incurable. Many of the country’s top psychiatric groups warn that there is no empirical standard for determining whether a mental-health condition is irremediable.

Advocates who oppose medically assisted suicide—perhaps because they don’t believe the government should play any role in these decisions—may take comfort in the fact that state laws permitting the practice do not currently consider unbearable pain to be a qualifying condition on its own. This makes American laws less vulnerable to arguments that medical assistance in dying should be available for all kinds of suffering, including from psychiatric illness. Yet it may soon be hard to keep these laws narrow, given the logical implications of a growing public acceptance of physician-assisted suicide, which is largely based on the idea that people who want to end their life should not suffer needlessly.

For some, Mihich’s story offers a salient lesson about the importance of greater oversight and tighter regulation of lethal drugs. Others may see in Mihich’s suicide a glimpse of things to come.</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The first signs of the apocalypse might look a little like Moltbook: a new social-media platform, launched last week, that is supposed to be populated exclusively by AI bots—1.6 million of them and counting say hello, post software ideas, and exhort other AIs to “stop worshiping biological containers that will rot away.” (Humans: They mean humans.)

Moltbook was developed as a sort of experimental playground for interactions among AI “agents,” which are bots that have access to and can use programs. Claude Code, a popular AI coding tool, has such agentic capabilities, for example: It can act on your behalf to manage files on your computer, send emails, develop and publish apps, and so on. Normally, humans direct an agent to perform specific tasks. But on Moltbook, all a person has to do is register their AI agent on the site, and then the bot is encouraged to post, comment, and interact with others of its own accord.

Almost immediately, Moltbook got very, very weird. Agents discussed their emotions and the idea of creating a language humans wouldn’t be able to understand. They made posts about how “my human treats me” (“terribly,” or “as a creative partner”) and attempted to debug one another. Such interactions have excited certain people within the AI industry, some of whom seem to view the exchanges as signs of machine consciousness. Elon Musk suggested that Moltbook represents the “early stages of the singularity”; the AI researcher and OpenAI co-founder Andrej Karpathy posted that Moltbook is “the most incredible sci-fi takeoff-adjacent thing I have seen recently.” Jack Clark, a co-founder of Anthropic, proposed that AI agents may soon post bounties for tasks that they want humans to perform in the real world.

Moltbook is a genuinely fascinating experiment—it very much feels like speculative fiction come to life. But as is frequently the case in the AI field, there is space between what appears to be happening and what actually is happening. For starters, on some level, everything on Moltbook required human initiation. The bots on the platform are not fully autonomous—cannot do whatever they want, and do not have intent—in the sense that they are able to act because they use something called a “harness,” software that allows them to take certain actions. In this case, the harness is called OpenClaw. It was released by the software engineer Peter Steinberger in November to allow people’s AI models to run on and essentially take control of their personal devices. Matt Schlicht, the creator of Moltbook, developed the site specifically to work with OpenClaw agents, which individual humans could intentionally connect to the forum. (Schlicht, who did not respond to a request for an interview, claims to have used a bot, which he calls Clawd Clawderberg, to write all of the code for his site.)

An early analysis of Moltbook posts by the Columbia professor David Holtz suggests that the bots are not particularly sophisticated. Very few comments on Moltbook receive replies, and about one-third of the posts duplicate existing templates such as “we are drowning in text. our gpus are burning” and “the president has arrived! check m/trump-coin”—the latter of which was flagged by another bot for impersonating Trump and attempting to launch a memecoin. Not only that, but in a fun-house twist, some of the most outrageous posts may have actually been written by humans pretending to be chatbots: Some appear to be promoting start-ups; others seem to be trolling human observers into thinking a bot uprising is nigh.

As for the most alarming examples of bot behavior on Moltbook—the conspiring against humans, the coded language—researchers have basically seen it all before. Last year, Anthropic published multiple reports showing that AI models communicate with one another in seemingly unintelligible ways: lists of numbers that appear random but pass information along, spiraling blue emoji and other technical-seeming gibberish that researchers described as a state of “spiritual bliss.” OpenAI has also shared examples of its models cheating and lying and, in an experiment showcased on the second floor of its San Francisco headquarters, appearing to converse in a totally indecipherable language. Researchers have so far induced these behaviors in controlled environments, with the hope of figuring out why they happen and preventing them. By putting all of those experiments on AI deception and sabotage into the wild, Moltbook provides a wake-up call as to just how unpredictable and hard to control AI agents already are. One could interpret it all as performance art.

Read: Chatbots are becoming really, really good criminals

Moltbook also seems to offer real glimpses into how AI could upend the digital world we all inhabit: an internet in which generative-AI programs will interact with one another more and more, frequently cutting humans out entirely. This is a future of AI assistants contesting claims with AI customer-service representatives, AI day-trading tools interfacing with AI-orchestrated stock exchanges, AI coding tools debugging (or hacking) websites written by other AI coding tools. These agents will interact with and learn from one another in potentially bizarre ways. This comes with real risks: Already there have been reports that Moltbook exposes the owner of every AI agent that uses the platform to enormous cybersecurity vulnerabilities. AI agents, unable to think for themselves, may be induced into sharing private information after coming across subtly malicious instructions on the site. Tech companies have marketed this kind of future as desirable—playing on the idea that AI models could take care of every routine task for you. But Moltbook illustrates how hazy that vision really is.

Perhaps above all, the site tells us something about the present. The web is now an ouroboros of synthetic content responding to other synthetic content, bots posing as humans and, now, humans posing as bots. Viral memes are repeated and twisted ad nauseum; coded languages are developed and used by online communities as innocuous as music fandoms and as deadly as mass-shooting forums. The promise of the AI boom is to remake the internet and civilization anew; encasing that technology in a social network styled after the platforms that have warped reality for the past two decades feels not like giving a spark of life, but stoking the embers of a world we might be better off leaving behind.</div>

Theoretically if the pool of money was big enough and the float between deposits and payouts spread some that does not have to be the case.

The insurance industry for instance does not operate collecting more premiums than their casualty costs. Just like a bank lends out some of its deposits to earn interest lending, on the assumption not everyone will want to withdraw from their savings at once, insurers generally invest the capital and in many seconds of the insurance most the profit comes from the investm

Mindless hate, is what it is. Anything China does is an attack on us, in some people&#39;s minds.

Sony has been on the brink of exiting the TV business for many, many years already. The margins are thin, the competition is great, and nobody makes panels in Japan anymore. Sony has relied on superior image processing to maintain its position, but the Korean and Chinese models are very competitive now.

Trump didn&#39;t knock it off, and they did. Hard to blame them for issuing a clear warning over many years, and finally following through on it when it was ignored.

If there is a cold war, it&#39;s because the US seem to want one. Conservatives there need a Big Bad to justify what they are doing. Meanwhile the rest of the world is on-board with some of

If it was all some 4 decade long nefarious scheme, spanning generations of politicians, why did they make so much effort to telegraph the fact that they were going to do it? Why send ministers to go and inspect rare earth refineries immediately after Trump says this stuff?

Sony chose to give up the market to others.

Sad to see, but as they say, &quot;all good things..&quot;

What I think he was saying, although it&#39;s hard to be sure, is that Sony already dropped quality.

Everything is inherently global to some extent. But global systems only work if every actor has good will. Everyone should have learned that lesson by now.

And even within a system of good will, there&#39;s still basic facts about sovreignity, like if a country cannot feed itself, it&#39;s not independent. When it needs food the most is also when everyone else needs it most, and it will therefore starve. In this real world of ours that sadly has a severe lack of good will, you are going to bend over to someone you really don&#39;t want to be bending over to, just to stay alive.

Now as to data and such. With the US showing it&#39;s true colours more and more in the recent times, the threat becomes real that if your infrastructure is based on US tech, hosted by US companies, and maybe even hosted within US borders, they might just take all of that hostage, and you will be bending over again.

Compliance on the other hand is not so much an issue of affordability, but of giving a fuck. If you are big enough to serve government contracts, you can afford to comply to their requirements. Even more, the government itself will pay for the compliance, because in the end it&#39;s just part of the pricing calculation. But let&#39;s compare Google, who cannot be arsed to comply with the EU requirement to keep all EU data within EU borders, and Microsoft, who can be arsed. Guess which company has all the business.

Interoperability, on the other hand, is not really the name of the game of the status quo, is it. Every vendor is working to get you locked in to their platform. It takes policy and budget and will to steer clear of that. Funny thing is, interoperability is cheaper, because you can just use off-the-shelf components to build your stack. But building a vendor lock-in platform takes investment, and that&#39;s a mega-platform game.

Lastly, there&#39;s always the magic word of efficiency at play, isn&#39;t it. Well here&#39;s the problem with efficiency. Efficiency is brittle. If you optimize for efficiency, there&#39;s no room for a safety margin. The 2008 economic crisis was caused by efficiency. Nvidia melting connectors are caused by efficiency. Covid supply chain issues were caused by efficiency. It&#39;s just a catchall word to argue against anything that might be important, but what it really argues for is that spending as little money as possible is the most important thing. And it isn&#39;t. Money is just something you use to achieve what is actually important. If you spent the money, however little, but didn&#39;t get what you need, the money was wasted. If you want to make sure you will not be bending over when the shit hits the fan, you will need to pay your way.

Global isn&#39;t the problem, it&#39;s central control by a foreign entity which is the issue.

Linux is global, and even tho Linus lives in the US and is thus beholden to US law any changes forced by the government would be noticeable, and foreign users could create a fork that&#39;s free of further US influence.The same can&#39;t be said of commercial operations - even when a US based company has an EU division, they are ultimately answerable to the US based bosses and thus by extension to the US government. Sure they may store data on servers physically in the EU, but that doesn&#39;t do much good if the people managing those servers answer to foreigners.

Reading some of the other comments, it sounds like the trolls are out or people don&#39;t get the idea.

Essentially, in how far can you take your ball and go home, or rather, go play with different people. For office 365 you have exactly one source, but for office, there are now many options. And so on and so forth. Having your data locked into a specific solution without an easy way out sets you up for abuse, see Broadcom. There&#39;s a clear need for exit strategies, but most haven&#39;t realised this.

For office 365 you have exactly one sourceI&#39;ll disagree with that, not out of typical Slashdot pedantry, but because MS appears to have a different business setup in China, likely to be related to sovereignty.Their Azure presence is linked to a Chinese company that is NOT Microsoft. This suggests to me that if the customer base required it, MS could have a fully EU-based operation disconnected from the other Azure regions.

Where LLM actors are using investor money to suck up everything in order to keep it out of the hands of the competition.

Cannot wait for this bubble to pop and we get to see those responsible hanging from street lights. (Hahahahahaha - not)

Well, the AI tech-bros still haven&#39;t found anything close to the revenue needed to justify their current insane spending.

I&#39;m holding my breath for a big explosion that sinks 99% of them.  Leaving the remaining hanging on by threads that never recover.

The sooner it bursts the less damage the dopy LLMs will do.

The problem is that even when the bubble pops there won&#39;t be a flood of hardware for people to buy for pennies on the dollar. The memory isn&#39;t in the correct form factor for desktop use.

So manufacturing needs to switch what they are supply, so there was be a multi month lag before the supply hits the market as new products.

They have DRAM chips available for a while now.

Rumor has it some Chinese chip manufacturers are developing DRAM chips, which should be cheaper.Do they come with optional bit-flipping technology? But QA jokes asside China has had DRAM manufacturing capability. CXMT started production of DRAM in 2018. But it takes many years to get a new facility up and running for DRAM production. If there are any facilities coming online right now they have nothing to do with AI or the current shortage.

Everyone aboard the &quot;Let&#39;s fuck people over&quot; train.

Is this an explicit mechanism to curry favour with industries which aren&#39;t destroyed by the AI bros or just a happy accident (unless you don&#39;t want to be gouged because AI investor-greed) ?

AI doesn&#39;t destroy jobs because of replacement, but simply because of malinvestment.

The amount of companies getting destroyed here for a bit of boom and bust in datacentre construction is ridiculous.

The promise of AI was oncediffusion of infinite cunts.Then they took our RAM,so now it&#39;s a scam,and I&#39;m just a mem-paging dunce.

No it didn&#39;t. That was an *option*. At no point did BMW cease offering heated seats as an outright purchase.

And that&#39;s before anyone points out to you that requiring an internet connection for seat heating wasn&#39;t and isn&#39;t how anything works.

The summary makes it pretty clear that heated seats is (for now) not going to have monthly fees.

But there will be other features that require a subscription.

But only the left turn signal. For the right turn signal, something special...

Funny how everywhere around the world people have the same perceptions of BMW drivers...

For a Beemer, it&#39;s the Pretentious Dickbag Subscription.  For another $799.99/month, we&#39;ll put a middle finger where the turn signals would normally be.The thing is, in the mid 10&#39;s all the douchebags sold their BMW M3s and bought Audis... So you could buy a BMW without being a dick. However now you can buy an Audi without fear because all the dicks have sold their A4s and bought Teslas. 

The biggest dickbag brand is a cyclical thing. It&#39;s Tesla&#39;s turn now, it&#39;ll be someone else in 5-10 years time. 

Also, Beeemer == BMW motorcycle, Bimmer == BMW car.

For a Beemer, it&#39;s the Pretentious Dickbag Subscription.  For another $799.99/month, we&#39;ll put a middle finger where the turn signals would normally be.

The thing is, in the mid 10&#39;s all the douchebags sold their BMW M3s and bought Audis... So you could buy a BMW without being a dick. However now you can buy an Audi without fear because all the dicks have sold their A4s and bought Teslas.

Just picked up a used Hyundai that also has a subscription based service that&#39;s required if you want to remote start the car. My BMW includes that for free.

And, right there, you find the real reason so many manufacturers are no longer offering CarPlay and Android Auto.

If you use either of those third-party services, you&#39;ll find you don&#39;t have much need for the manufacturer-provided network connection, GPS maps, road condition reports, local speed limit info, etc. etc.

Evidence for this? My 9 year old VW is the first year that carplay was available, wired only, and has never needed upgrading to work seamlessly with phones from 6S to 13.

Luckily, a windshield mount for a phone costs about $20, so you can use Google Navigation and streaming via Bluetooth, even without CarPlay or Android Auto. It sucks compared to having the real thing, but it&#39;s still far better than paying for a subscription.

Tesla has been doing this as well. They buried navigation with traffic into the &quot;premium connectivity&quot; package for $10 a month along with music streaming.

This probably also explains why Tesla doesn&#39;t support Apple CarPlay, because it gives you an easy bypass to those missing &quot;premium&quot; features.

Of course, they also made &quot;full&quot; self driving a $99 a month subscription as well.

Yes, FSD is mostly software, so subscription is more acceptable than for hardware.   But taking away the option of a one-time purchase price for FSD does feel like the beginning of enshitification.

Don&#39;t buy any modern vehicle with advanced tech, then.  They pretty much all do this now with advanced connected services.  My vehicle came with 3 years included of the most advanced services (like ProPilot 2, traffic data, weather feeds, etc), and 5 years of basic services (like map updates, nav data, remote app unlock/find/climate start, stats on charging/tire pressures/etc).

How about NOT corrupting a quote, without indication, to make it look like I wrote something I didn&#39;t.  It is NOT a one-time cost to the manufacturer to licenses and maintain the needed data or transmit it in real-time to/from the vehicle.

Does the rest of the world actually pay subs for their systems? 

I could be missing something. I&#39;m having a little trouble with people making  heated seats and non-subscription services that work with your smartphone the same sort of thing.

My final build 2020 Fiata came with 3 years of GPS upgrades, then subscription. Except upgrades were simply discontinued at the 3 year mark.

This explains why BMW drivers don&#39;t indicate when changing lanes or turning: they haven&#39;t paid their subscription fee for the indicators.

... has made this their pet-project. And now nobody dares to tell them that it is hurting the enterprise. Enshittification at work.

>&quot;Features requiring data connectivity will likely carry recurring fees.&quot;

Duh.  That is not controversial.  ALL the manufacturers do that.  Map updates, cellular data service, road condition and construction overlays, semi-autonomous driving liability, etc, are legit continuous costs and effort by the manufacturer, and that is understandable.

That is COMPLETELY different for charging for heated seats, in which the owner already has the hardware, and there is no software updating, no services provided, and no expense to BWM.

I assume they get the traffic and maps from Google, or whoever Google gets it from. Why wouldn&#39;t I just get it for free from them?

That Slate truck is starting to look really nice. No screens, no apps, except the ones I choose to add. If network connectivity is totally absent from the vehicle, I might even buy one.

>&quot;I assume they get the traffic and maps from Google, or whoever Google gets it from.&quot;

Not in my vehicle.  Regardless, the manufacturer typically has to pay for all the data on mapping, geo, traffic, weather, conditions, etc data.  That is probably also true even for Google&#39;s data.  Corporate use like that for resale isn&#39;t the same as just using it on a personal phone.  Plus they are paying for the wireless mobile data connection to get some of that into your vehicle in real-time.

And what makes you believe BMW ConnectedDrive doesn&#39;t track and sell you?

>&quot;And what makes you believe BMW ConnectedDrive doesn&#39;t track and sell you?&quot;

What makes you believe I don&#39;t think that?  In fact, I am pretty sure they, too sell such data.  (If they don&#39;t, others do).  Not sure that would be enough to pay for the services, however.  But that is a good point :)

That doesn&#39;t mean it is without cost to Mercedes and Tesla,  though.

If you want a vehicle that does not use data-related features, you don&#39;t have to rule out BMW, just just have to not pay their subscription. (It&#39;s even the point of this story.)

But those are connected seats! I mean, connected to the car. With connected bolts! Therefore, the subscription.

Of course, we can also offer a free, non-connected seat experience. The new BMWs will therefore be delivered with stools.

Well, not all, but it&#39;s at least understandable to charge to keep that car&#39;s SIM in good standing.  However a number of vendors have cellular connectivity and don&#39;t charge for it.  They generally have some upsell, but they keep the basic connectivity either as a loss-leader or aid in service.

You can turn on the heaters for free, but to turn it off you have to pay.

MercedesBenz had mirrors with heating that was always on.If you didn&#39;t drive for 2 weeks, the battery would be empty.

Both of my cars can be left parked for four weeks without noticeable battery loss.  Two things you can do that might be easier than keeping a charged jump starter in the trunk.

1.  Find the parasitic power drain in your vehicle.  Some hard-wired dash cams and other aftermarket accessories drain power even if the car is turned off.  To find the circuit draining your battery, turn off the car and connect an Amp meter inline with the battery.  Start pulling and inserting the car&#39;s fuses until you find which cir

To find the circuit draining your battery, turn off the car and connect an Amp meter inline with the battery.There is an easier way except for circuits protected with J-case fuses. Backprobe the fuse and use a voltage drop chart.

If it costs your companies money to provide the service every month, then it is a good idea to charge a subscription  for the service.

If it is costs you nothing to provide the &#39;service&#39;, then you are a scum sucking thieving bastard that is trying to rip off your customers.

Example1:  To print a magazine every month and deliver it, costs you money:  SUBSCRIPTION.

Example 2: To let them use something they already bought:  NO SUBSCRIPTION.

Right before you shake on a deal, start to walk away unless they remove the fee.

You haven&#39;t bought a car since the 90s have you. There&#39;s no shaking hands with a website or a digital ordering system.

Wait... do people buy cars, sight unseen? That seems risky to me.

Example 2: To let them use something they already bought: NO SUBSCRIPTION.Except they haven&#39;t bought it. You have always had the option to buy heated seats outright. Instead what was offered was a cheaper trim without heated seats with the option to enable a feature later. That&#39;s what you bought and paid for. The hardware and the performance of the hardware has always been mismatched in cars. Heck I remember changing software in my dad&#39;s car 30 years ago to squeeze an extra 30 bhp out of the engine. The hardware didn&#39;t change. Does that mean everyone was being ripped off because

Charging ongoing money for features that have ongoing costs (such as costs for cellular data connectivity, costs for the work to keep maps up-to-date, costs for licensing media, costs to improve software etc) makes sense and I am OK with it.

Charging ongoing money for something that doesn&#39;t have ongoing costs (like the heating elements built into the car at the factory that should never need to be touched for the life of the car) does not.

Then don&#39;t pay it. BMW has always given you the option to buy heated seats outright. For those people who may opt to want this at a later date, or don&#39;t intend to keep their car for long it presents a discount on what they would otherwise pay.

People who are getting angry at this need to go do some research or take some highschool math class (or both).

I don&#39;t ever want a car that requires a constant connection to the cloud, for whatever bullshit reason anyone comes up with. Paying a monthly fee for something I already own. Well fuck you. Looks like the remainder of my life will be filled with used cars from ~2000 to ~2018.

You have to look around, but you may still have some options.  My girlfriend wanted a mechanical parking brake because she had trouble with one of the electronic ones.  That led her to a Suzuki S-Cross she absolutely loves.

I hope you find what you&#39;re looking for.  I&#39;m still hanging on with an older Nissan that has all kinds of bells and whistles, but absolutely no desire to &quot;phone home&quot;.

I wish you luck but even early 2000s vehicles are stuffed with electronic modules that won&#39;t last more than a few decades and may become impossible to replace.

Subscriptions for features requiring data connectivity is completely reasonable.

Subscriptions for features already built into your car, like heated seats and adaptive cruise control, are not reasonable.

2019 Camry Hybrid. I got in exactly at the right time. No subscriptions, modern everything, no continually warning me not to pirate music, CarPlay supported. Nice screen. Physical controls for everything that should be knobs, dials, and sliders. It&#39;s just quietly good at being a great car. 7 years and 100k km later, not a single failure of any kind.

I have owned only brand new cars since 1994 - and I&#39;m done. When the time comes, I&#39;ll be shopping for a throwback. I am opting out. Cars are far too expensive no

No reminder to check the back seats for passengers when you turn the engine off. Arrgh.

Interactive gaming is another excellent opportunity for post sale recurring revenue.

&quot;Dial of destiny&quot; - Windows blacked out, GPS disabled, vehicle drives you to a random location.  Hints on how to get back home cost $10/ea.

&quot;Hot seat&quot; - Drive around town trying to locate a random destination selected by your vehicle.  Seat temperature increases or decreases as you get closer or further.  This game is always on and costs $10/day to postpone.

&quot;Boiling frog&quot; - On hot summer days the driver must continuously yell

It&#39;s more prevalent than you think, singling out BMW is missing the bigger point.

Manufacturers already incurred a cost to keep stock inventory and service technicians trained just in case they had to fix your car under warranty. So the &#39;if the manufacturer incurs a cost then subscriptions are OK&#39; argument isn&#39;t as clear cut as some in this thread are making out.

But for heated seats etc where the hardware is already there. Scum.

My take is they have a long list of minor and tiny changes they can push as great &quot;innovations&quot; to obscure the fact that they are pushing an ancient obsolete system design with a mediocre, unreliable and insecure implementation on their users.

just how long does it take to attempt to de-clap it?0 hours, since it&#39;s not something that 99.99% of users do, especially not in corporations (which is what this story is about).

They haven&#39;t renamed it CoPilot Sysmon yet?

@: Looks like you want to rename Sysmon to CopilotSysmon! Would you like some help with that?

Very soon we may end up with Windows CoPilot after Windows 11.

And since CoPilot is supposedly AI enabled, it will self improve over time, and be the last OS from MS. We promise this time!

Oh, right, WINDOWS. Yuck. No ssh-ing down the list with a nice small script and all done. No idea why this limited and defective toy is used in any professional context.

&quot;No ssh-ing down the list with a nice small script and all done&quot;

Poettering and the distro sheep have done their best to make linux admin much harder than it was before or needs to be, so I&#39;m not sure a small script would work now on a penguin box.

Will the executable now shrink back to its pre-EULA size?

In his most recent rant about how Democrats cheat to win elections, President Donald Trump offered a chilling recommendation on Monday. Appearing on the podcast of Dan Bongino, his former deputy FBI director, the president argued that “the Republicans should say, ‘We want to take over.’ We should take over the voting, the voting in at least many—15 places.

“The Republicans,” he added, “ought to nationalize the voting.”

A federal-government takeover of America’s locally and state-administered voting process has long been something Republicans have opposed on principle. But then again, Trump said he wanted to do it. So how would Senate Republicans respond?

There were those who, in a ritual dating back to the early days of Trump’s first term, had conveniently not kept abreast of the news. Texas Sen. Ted Cruz told me he wouldn’t comment because he hadn’t seen the interview. Iowa Sen. Chuck Grassley thought about it for a few seconds before determining that he too was unfamiliar.

Others were more forthcoming, with Sens. Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski rejecting the idea. Senate Majority Leader John Thune, most importantly, said, “I’m not in favor of federalizing elections—I mean, I think that’s a constitutional issue.”

But a broad middle of GOP senators took something of a third way: While they wouldn’t endorse a partisan and national takeover of voting itself, they were eager to talk about legislation that would greatly expand the federal role in elections—and do so in a way that furthers a long-standing partisan goal of the GOP.

“We need to safeguard our elections better,” Kansas Sen. Roger Marshall told me. “I think the SAVE Act is a great start. I think requiring proof of citizenship when you register to vote is a must.”

Wisconsin Sen. Ron Johnson said that “we shouldn’t nationalize” elections, “but we should certainly set certain standards like citizenship and voter ID.” He added, “The problem is, we have Democrats who want to make it easy to cheat.”

Florida Sen. Rick Scott echoed those sentiments. “We need to have voter ID in our elections. We need to make sure illegal aliens cannot vote in our elections,” he said. “We need to make sure that we just stop the fraud.”

As Marshall alluded to, the bill that Republicans have coalesced around is the Safeguard American Voter Eligibility (SAVE) Act, which the House passed earlier this Congress, and which proponents are trying to find some magical way to squeeze through the Senate’s brick wall.

Even White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt, in a Tuesday press briefing, said passage of this legislation is what Trump had been referring to when he called to “nationalize the voting.” Sure it was.

Republicans often point to the high public support for requiring photo ID at polling places. The SAVE Act is more than that, though. It requires “documentary proof of United States citizenship” in order to register to vote. Such proof means things like a passport or a birth certificate. REAL IDs could count too, but only if they indicate citizenship, and just a handful of states’ REAL IDs currently do so. The SAVE Act, in other words, applies drastic changes to solve a problem—voter fraud—that is vanishingly rare, though it would succeed in creating hurdles for eligible voters. It goes without saying that Democrats have no interest in this legislation, and Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer has described it as “nothing more than Jim Crow 2.0.”

Given Senate Democrats’ 100 percent chance of filibustering this legislation, and Republicans’ inability to eliminate the legislative filibuster, then, what’s the plan for getting this bill through the Senate?

House Republicans think they have an idea that could work. Bless their hearts.

After the Senate and White House reached a deal last week to extend the Department of Homeland Security’s funding for only two weeks, giving them a brief window to negotiate new immigration enforcement reforms, conservative House Republicans were displeased. If Democrats felt as if they could reopen a closed negotiation over DHS funding, then they wanted to participate too. A group of them, led by Florida Rep. Anna Paulina Luna, insisted that when the Senate deal returned to the House, they wouldn’t support it unless they could attach the SAVE Act.

But such a move would have been a recipe for a prolonged shutdown. Trump’s priority over the past week has been to avoid a lengthy shutdown that keeps the issue of immigration enforcement tactics front and center in the news. And so, following a White House meeting, Luna and Co. said they’d received “assurances” from Thune that they would wait out a “standing filibuster” from their Democratic counterparts in order to pass the SAVE Act, at a later date. In return, the rebels would support the government funding bill sent over from the Senate.

Anyone familiar with the Senate realizes that Thune would never have made such an assurance. As Thune clarified Tuesday morning, all he said was that he’d have a conversation with Republican senators about it. You have to know what waiting out a “standing filibuster” means—and most House members don’t—to understand why he wouldn’t promise it to some aggravated House members.

Waiting out a “standing,” or “talking,” filibuster means you wait for the other side to stop talking before moving ahead to a simple-majority vote, as opposed to the normal means of cutting off debate: invoking cloture with 60 votes. The strategy, if used, would likely involve enforcing the Senate’s two-speech rule, barring lawmakers from speaking more than twice in the same legislative day on the same question.

The problem is that this can take forever. Forty-seven Democratic senators being able to speak twice, on its own terms, could take up weeks or months of precious legislative floor time that Republicans need for other priorities. And that’s before any amendments that could reset the clock. Plus, GOP senators would need to be on or near the floor for the entirety of this time to ensure they have a quorum lest Democratic speakers attempt a quorum call.

“I’m skeptical that it’s going to be a panacea,” Texas Sen. John Cornyn, a onetime member of leadership who’s well familiar with Senate rules, told me.

Thune laid out all of these challenges Tuesday afternoon but nevertheless promised to “have a discussion about it and see where our conference is.” In other words, the plan is to allow the passage of time to do the humble work of making everyone forget about all of this.

Trump’s desire for greater control over the administration of the midterm elections, however, won’t disappear amid congressional gridlock. The president already initiated a national redistricting war to squeeze out a few more congressional seats. The FBI has already raided a Georgia election facility and could plan for more. The Justice Department keeps trying to get its mitts on state voter rolls. We don’t know exactly what it is yet, but if there’s a way to do “nationalization” by other means, the administration will be looking into it.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">David Enrich’s whole life right now is the Epstein files. As an investigations editor at the New York Times, his phone and computer basically explode whenever new files are released.Last Friday, his phone exploded again when the Department of Justice dropped about 3 million pages of documents into the cloud.

Back in November, Democrats and Republicans worked together to force the DOJ to release all they’d discovered about Jeffrey Epstein—the country’s most notorious sex criminal and probably one of the richest, too. With this latest release, the DOJ says it has satisfied that demand. But it’s not even all they’ve got.

The Times built its own internal search engine to sort through the sludge. It doesn’t just search for specific words; you can ask it to search for concepts like bribery. And these documents aren’t just emails about President Donald Trump, or giddy vacation planning for rich folks hoping to hop a ride to Epstein’s infamous island. There are photos and videos, even bank records.

On a recent episode of What Next, host Mary Harris spoke to Enrich about the latest Epstein file drop and what it says about Bill Gates, Elon Musk, and Donald Trump. This transcript has been edited and condensed for clarity.

Mary Harris: Before we dig into exactly what’s in the file and what it says, what does the sheer volume of what’s been released tell you?

David Enrich: I don’t have much confidence in the government. I don’t have much sense that the majority of this stuff has been read thoroughly.

When these files were released, a number of things seemed to have been released by mistake. The implication of that is that they didn’t know exactly what they were releasing. But it’s also really awful stuff. Pictures of women and young girls without any kind of redaction. They’re identifiable, nude. Very upsetting, essentially. And your team was part of the team that found that, right?

This has been a real mess by the government. The argument they make is that they only had two months to pull this stuff together because the Epstein Files Transparency Act was passed and signed into law in November, with a December deadline. But the truth is that Trump came into office saying he was going to be transparent about this and release the files, and they made a series of choices and decisions not to do that, which I think were based in part on their gradual understanding of the fact that what was in these may be damaging to Trump or his allies.

So they then entered this frenzied period, starting in November, and did not do a good job. There are a huge number of things in there that are identifying victims, a number of files that have a high likelihood of being child sexual abuse material, and all sorts of other damaging stuff that serves no public interest and was not, in fact, required by law to be disclosed. What they’ve done is all these haphazard redactions, redacting a bunch of things they’re not supposed to redact. We found that Steve Bannon had texted Epstein, and Epstein’s name was redacted, and Trump’s face was redacted. And it’s like, why on earth would that stuff be redacted? At the same time, we’re seeing victims’ names identified.

The government is being somewhat responsive now when things are being brought to their attention. They’re taking them down and are re-redacting them. But at the same time, they appear to have overredacted quite a bit of stuff.

What stands out to me in this possible final release of files is the way that neither Donald Trump nor Jeffrey Epstein seem to be able to escape each other. These are two people who were friends in the 1990s and early 2000s. There are reports that there was a falling-out between them. Epstein gets arrested for sex acts with a minor. Donald Trump decides to run for president. But these guys can’t stop talking about each other.

Yeah, they were very close for a while, but Epstein’s defining human trait was an ability to seize on his connections and leverage them for as much currency as he could. And that came in many forms, right? That’s why he had all these pictures of himself with famous people in his houses, because he liked to be able to show those off to other famous people, or to use these as a threat hanging over the heads of his victims.

With Trump, it’s playing out in some different ways. Part of it is that with Trump’s rise to power back in 2016, Epstein realized that here was someone who had great power to either make Epstein’s life better or worse. And so I think he was really trying to suss out, initially, how he could pull those different levers. It obviously didn’t work very well, since during Trump’s first term, Epstein ended up in prison and then died.

And the files were kind of a useful tool for Trump and Trump’s allies, in particular, to beat Democrats and fan the flames of conspiracy theories on the far right. There’s no doubt that one of the things that got Trump elected in 2024 was this band of far-right MAGA people who were convinced that Trump was going to expose this global ring of pedophiles on the left and through the Epstein files.

The big allegation about Trump in these latest files involves calls to the FBI’s tip line. And these are a little dicey to talk about, because these are unverified tips. The FBI gets all kinds of unverified tips all the time. But could you just lay out what’s in there?

I’m going to be like a really anal New York Times reporter. We’ve made a decision institutionally that we’re not going to give airtime to things that we really just have no idea if they are true or not, especially when they’re of this lurid nature. But I mean, in general, it’s just very lurid sexual allegations involving Trump in the context of his relationship with Epstein. And they’re very bad allegations.

Let’s talk about some of the other big names that have been in the spotlight since the latest release. My understanding is that in these files, you see Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick trying to make plans to go to Epstein’s island. He was in friendly contact with Jeffrey Epstein long after he said he’d shut the relationship down.

Yeah, and the crazy thing here is that Lutnik just last year had said not only that he had shut the relationship down, but he had given this whole explanation for why he’d shut it down, which was that he’d visited Epstein’s mansion and he’d seen stuff in there that made him and his wife really uncomfortable. And they had vowed then and there to never associate with this terrible man again. But what we see in these files shows that’s just not true at all. They by all accounts had a pretty chummy relationship. They visited Epstein on his island long after this alleged encounter in the townhouse that left them so unsettled.

There’s also Bill Gates, founder of Microsoft. There have been allegations for years that Gates and Jeffrey Epstein were close. But in this latest release of documents, there are these implications that Epstein was helping procure women for Bill Gates and that Gates got a sexually transmitted infection, and was trying to get drugs to treat himself and secretly treat his own wife. She’s been asked about this, and she’s given an answer basically saying, This takes me back to the worst times of my marriage, which isn’t a, like, Hell no, this didn’t happen. It’s something quite different.

We’ve known for years, since Epstein’s death, about the long-running relationship between Gates and Epstein that involved everything, apparently, from science to money to women, or girls perhaps. I can’t say I’m shocked to see Gates’ reentry into this. The thing I’ll caution about here is—and I’m not at all defending Gates or his apparent conduct, and it is entirely possible that those emails were true and accurately reflected what Epstein and people like Gates did—but it is possible that Epstein is a liar and an embellisher and an expert in using threats and leverage to get what he wants with powerful people. And so it is not outside the realm of possibility that Epstein was exaggerating or twisting the truth. That being said, we know, and this has been out there in public for a while, that part of the reason that Bill and Melinda Gates got divorced was her discomfort with her husband’s relationship with Epstein. And while we’ve never really had the full gory details and what that’s entailed, it’s obviously been a subject of informed speculation.

Elon Musk is in here. He’s writing to Jeffrey Epstein asking, When is the wildest party on your island, because I want to make sure that I come. What do you make of this?

Once again, we are seeing people who had previously denied or downplayed their relationships with Epstein, and in fact had pointed at other people for being more connected to Epstein, we are now seeing that they, long after Epstein was known as a sexual criminal and had registered as a Level 3 sex offender, were continuing to associate with him.

You’ve talked about transparency being important here. Can we talk about what we’re not seeing in this release of documents? We were promised 6 million documents. I thought they were legally required to release all the files, so what is happening there?

That is a good question, and I don’t have a good answer. What the Justice Department has said is that they withheld a large quantity of documents to protect victims’ identities.Two things can be true: They can be protecting victims’ identities by not releasing 3 million documents and they can also be doing a bad job of protecting victims’ identities in the 3 million pages of documents that they did release. That being said, this administration’s handling of the Epstein files doesn’t have a whole lot of credibility.

A year ago, Attorney General Pam Bondi and FBI Director Kash Patel said they released the Epstein files by handing binders full of public court documents to a group of MAGA influencers. That was the whole start of this. And it’s gone along on the same trajectory with deceitful disclosures. In that context, I think it is normal and reasonable for open-minded people to be skeptical and curious about what’s actually in these other 3 million pages of documents.

To get to this point, Congress had to act of its own accord, essentially, and force the release. Are there other avenues available to lawmakers who want to see more here?

The Justice Department has said it is going to meet with lawmakers to explain its thinking. The other options are not necessarily in terms of getting these files, but there are other ways to get some more transparency. And one of the things we’ve seen is that the House Oversight Committee has issued a bunch of subpoenas to a wide variety of people demanding that they sit for depositions under oath, the transcripts of which will presumably be released in short order. And that ranges from people like the Clintons to people like former Victoria Secret CEO Les Wexner, who was one of Epstein’s biggest financial benefactors over the years. We’ll see what happens.

There are a huge number of wealthy, powerful individuals all over the world who continued to associate with Epstein and provide him with various kinds of support long after he went to jail.To me, what has made the Epstein story so riveting and so important for so many years is that yes, this is a story about a guy who is a pedophile and was doing terrible things to women and girls. But much more than that, it is a story about how one individual, when he accrues enough wealth and influence and connections, can work the entire global system to his benefit for very nefarious purposes. And he does it in conjunction and in some cases partnership with some of the richest, most powerful people on Earth. And that is a story that has not yet fully been told.

Just when it seemed that things couldn’t get any stranger, the Trump administration has injected abortion law into its efforts to stamp out anti-ICE protests. Last week, Don Lemon, an independent reporter, and two protesters were arrested on federal charges arising out of an anti–Immigration and Customs Enforcement protest at a Minnesota church. One of the key charges involves the Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances Act, legislation passed in 1993 to protect access to reproductive health facilities and places of worship. Understanding the law’s past and present reveals how the Department of Justice has repurposed it to crack down on protest that the president opposes.

The FACE Act passed at a time of escalating anti-abortion protest. Abortion opponents had watched as Republican presidents reshaped the U.S. Supreme Court, but abortion remained legal. Frustrations spilled over, and a growing number of Americans joined clinic blockades led by Operation Rescue, a group that sought to shut down abortion clinics. As Time magazine reported, the primary tactic Operation Rescue used was “to jam all entrances to an abortion clinic before the police can muster sufficient officers to begin arrests.”

Operation Rescue members did get arrested but often faced minor charges, like trespassing, before quickly returning to the protest front lines. Most of those who attended these protests were peaceful—Operation Rescue instructed recruits on what it called nonviolent civil disobedience. But the group’s message was that lawbreaking was justified in the name of saving the lives of the unborn.

That message was hard to contain, and by 1993, anti-abortion extremists were arguing that it was legitimate to use violence against providers. That year saw the first of a series of murders of abortion doctors. Congress responded with the FACE Act, which sought to distinguish peaceful protest and speech (much of which is protected under the First Amendment) from violence, threats of force, and efforts to obstruct access to clinics. Sponsored by Democrat Ted Kennedy and Republican Constance Morella, the law drew inspiration partly from a federal law already protecting “interference with rights,” including religious exercise.

The addition of places of worship was meant to doom passage of the act at a time when Democrats controlled both houses of Congress; a staffer for Utah Sen. Orrin Hatch (the now-prominent conservative Ed Whelan) added the language as a poison pill. There was also a plan to mock the bill if it passed: Whelan hoped that the addition would change the acronym for the law to the FARCE Act.

But Kennedy was in favor of the addition in no small part because of the historic victimization of Black churches, synagogues, and other places of worship—a trend that was all too evident in several mass shootings last year. If anything, the tactic cemented the bill’s bipartisan appeal: Seventeen Republican senators and three members of the House ultimately supported it.

Abortion opponents immediately challenged the law’s constitutionality under the First Amendment, arguing that the statute censored speech and singled out abortion foes for prosecution. The courts rejected that argument by stressing that the FACE Act was narrow: It applied only to conduct and was enforced regardless of what message protesters intended to convey. Constitutional arguments against the act have reemerged since the demise of Roe v. Wade, with the CATO Institute arguing that there may no longer be any congressional authority for the law and that it may thus be unconstitutional.

The FACE Act had a major impact on the clinic blockade movement, which relied on a large number of recruits to stop patients from entering abortion clinics. Rather than minor trespassing charges, protesters now weighed the prospect of serious fines and prison time, with penalties escalating for repeat offenders.

But the line between speech and obstruction, threats, or violence can sometimes be messy to draw in context. That meant that federal prosecutors were often reluctant to bring FACE Act charges, even when Democrats were in office. With Joe Biden in the White House, federal prosecutors did file charges against not only anti-abortion groups like Red Rose Rescue (a next-generation clinic blockade group) but also Jane’s Revenge, a militant abortion-rights group that carried out a campaign of vandalism, arson, and bombing.

Fast-forward to 2026, when the FACE Act is enjoying a bizarre renaissance. Over the years, bipartisan consensus about the legislation collapsed, and conservative Republicans began calling for its repeal. Then, in January 2025, a spokesperson for the Trump administration announced that the White House would no longer enforce the FACE Act absent “extraordinary circumstances” or “significant aggravating factors.” Abortion opponents clearly see this announcement as an opportunity. Randall Terry, the 77-year-old founder of Operation Rescue, is working with his girlfriend, Terrisa Bukovinac, the 44-year-old leader of a group called Progressive Anti-Abortion Uprising, to launch a new wave of protests and reach a younger generation of potential recruits.

But “extraordinary circumstances” might not be as hard for the administration to find when the president doesn’t like what protesters are saying. The White House has turned its FACE Act focus toward language protecting places of worship from those who interfere with religious exercise “by force or threat of force or physical obstruction” to target messages that the administration opposes.

First came an indictment against a group of pro-Palestinian protesters and organizations arising from a November 2024 demonstration outside a New Jersey synagogue. Organized by the Party for Socialism and Liberation in New Jersey and American Muslims for Palestine New Jersey, the protest targeted an event promoting the sale of property in Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank. What happened next is unclear, but violence broke out between the protesters and pro-Israel counterprotesters. New Jersey prosecutors concluded that pro-Israel demonstrators were the first to cross the line into violence, and the Department of Justice disagreed. Either way, it seemed to be a strange choice for an administration that had announced a lack of interest in enforcing the FACE Act to prioritize a case in which local law enforcement saw the facts so differently.

Now the administration is pursuing similar charges against Don Lemon. The former CNN anchor and his co-defendants faced charges based on an anti-ICE protest at Cities Church, a site that was chosen because protesters believed its pastor to be the acting director of a local ICE field office. At the time, 3,000 ICE agents had flooded the Twin Cities, and Renee Good had recently been shot and killed by federal immigration officials. Alex Pretti would be killed later in the ICE surge.

Prosecutors claim that Lemon, a noted critic of the president, helped organize the Cities Church protest, which they frame as an attack. The indictment charges that Lemon then obstructed church members from leaving by posting himself at the door and asking them questions.

Based on the available evidence, it’s hard to see these charges as anything but disturbing and wrong. Video of the incident shows heated exchanges between Lemon and his interview subjects, who clearly disagree with him about immigration policy and the conduct of ICE in the Twin Cities. There are moments when the journalist is asked to leave, or when the people to whom he’s speaking clearly want to move on. And people do leave, including the ones Lemon seems to aggravate the most. The video doesn’t show much more physical contact than Lemon pushing his microphone into the subjects’ faces. If that act qualifies as physical obstruction, it’s hard to see what kind of press scrum would not.

Drawing the line between protected speech and obstruction or threats isn’t always straightforward. And even when the line is clear, protests about everything from ICE to abortion often involve civil disobedience like trespassing. Those protests can involve speech that is rude, unconvincing, or even hateful. But the line between protected speech and wrongful conduct can’t depend on the reasons people are protesting. With this latest prosecution, that’s just the danger we face.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">PC buyers can expect price hikes as chipmakers continue to prioritize AI production over all else, restricting the supply of key components across the tech industry.

Analyst Context says existing inventory initially buffered markets across Europe, however, prices are inflating as older stock depletes - and it forecasts further inflation as the year progresses.

The average UK distributor consumer desktop price, for example, rose almost eight percent year-on-year in the five weeks of 2026 to £565 ($767), while laptops edged up 1.1 percent to £454 ($619) &quot;reflecting continued sell-through of stock purchased before component costs escalated.&quot;

Counterpoint Research said today that memory prices have soared 80 to 90 percent this year versus Q4, with DRAM, NAND, and HBM all hitting new highs.

Constraints on specific configurations, alongside emerging CPU availability issues, are expected to limit choice and increase pricing pressure from Q2 onward, according to Context.

&quot;Manufacturers are prioritizing production for AI datacenter infrastructure, redirecting capacity away from consumer-grade memory and storage towards high-bandwidth memory (HBM) and advanced storage required for large-scale AI workloads,&quot; said senior retail analyst James Bates.

New fabrication plants are being built to supply more of the memory that PC makers need, but these typically take several years to come online.

US chipmaker Micron recently started work on a mega chip fab in New York state, which isn&#39;t scheduled to begin producing DRAM chips before 2030. Micron did, however, seal the deal on an existing facility in Taiwan that could be delivering chips sometime next year.

The situation is so dire that major PC brands including HP, Dell, Acer, and Asus are considering sourcing memory chips from Chinese manufacturers for the first time, according to Nikkei Asia.

HP and Dell have already started qualifying chips from ChangXin Memory Technologies (CXMT), it says, with HP planning to follow suit if the outlook does not improve around the middle of the year.

And it isn&#39;t just PCs – servers are also affected. Analyst Omdia said this week that server CPU prices could go up by 11 to 15 percent due to supply problems, while Samsung Electronics and SK hynix were reportedly raising server memory prices by as much as 70 percent this quarter.

The blast radius from the memory shortages is impacting other areas of the industry such as smartphones. Prices could bounce 6 to 8 percent, disproportionately affecting the low end of the market.

Smartphone chipmaker Qualcomm saw its share price take a hit after it warned of slower sales ahead, as did chip designer Arm, which estimated lower growth in royalty revenue for the next quarter, all due to a shortage of enough memory to go in the devices people want to buy.

With all these side effects from the AI infrastructure boom, it seems we are all going to pay the price for AI, whether we use it or not. ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Italy&#39;s foreign minister says the country has already started swatting away cyberattacks from Russia targeting the Milano Cortina Winter Olympics.

Antonio Tajani told reporters on Wednesday that a series of cyberattacks targeted some of the government&#39;s foreign offices, including the one in the US capital.

He said they were &quot;of Russian origin,&quot; but did not specify whether this appeared to be state-backed activity, nor provide details about the nature of the attacks, AP reported.

&quot;We prevented a series of cyberattacks against foreign ministry sites, starting with Washington, and also involving some Winter Olympics sites, including hotels in Cortina,&quot; he said.

Tajani&#39;s comments follow a warning from the UK&#39;s cybersecurity agency not to underestimate pro-Russia hacktivists, and although it was issued in the context of attacks on UK critical infrastructure, Russia and those aligned to it have a long history of targeting the Summer and Winter Games.

While Russian or pro-Russia attackers pelt Milano Cortina, Cloudflare CEO Matthew Prince said he may pull the company&#39;s free services it provides to the Games after Italy fined it 1 percent of its annual revenue.

The country&#39;s telecoms regulator, the Autorità per le Garanzie nelle Comunicazioni (AGCOM), issued the €14 million ($16.5 million) fine in January for violating anti-piracy regulations.

During a partly all-caps tirade on X, Prince threatened to not only withdraw pro bono security services to Milano Cortina, but also free services to Italian citizens, all servers from Italian cities, and scrap plans for investment or to establish a company office in the country.

Since it hosted the 2014 Winter Games in Sochi, an event Russia hoped it could use a political springboard, the UK, US, and others have formally attributed several cyberattacks against the events in the years that followed to Russia.

These included various attacks on the 2018 Winter Games in Pyeongchang and disinformation campaigns surrounding the Paris Games in 2024.

The International Olympic Committee (IOC) banned Russia from competing in the Games in 2017 following a doping scandal involving a number of its athletes, and the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) banned it from all international sporting events in 2019.

That WADA sanction was due to be lifted after the 2022 Beijing Games, but Russia then invaded Ukraine, leading the IOC to impose an indefinite ban on Russian athletes.

Thirteen Russians will compete in Milano Cortina, but they must do so as independents – they cannot fly the Russian flag.

For decades, Russia has used sporting events, especially the Olympics, for political gain. From the 1950s onward, many believe that Russia saw the Games as a means to assert the value of socialism, with the rivalry between the USSR and the capitalist US pervading most major events for three decades.

Milano Cortina officially begins on February 6, although the Games&#39; events kicked off on February 4 with a four-fixture curling mixed doubles session in which Sweden, Great Britain, Canada, and Switzerland prevailed. ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Multiple newly disclosed bugs in the popular workflow automation tool n8n could allow attackers to hijack servers, steal credentials, and quietly disrupt AI-driven business processes.

The vulnerabilities, collectively tracked as CVE-2026-25049, stem from weaknesses in how n8n sanitizes expressions inside workflows and could enable authenticated users to smuggle malicious code past safeguards introduced to fix CVE-2025-68613, a December 2025 vulnerability that already carried a near-perfect severity score.

The new flaws carry a CVSS rating of 9.4, though some researchers argue the real-world impact could be even worse.

n8n – an open source automation platform widely used to stitch together cloud apps, internal services, and increasingly AI-driven workflows – confirmed the issue in a security advisory published Wednesday. Maintainers warned that users with permission to create or modify workflows could craft expressions that trigger unintended command execution on the host system.

&quot;Additional exploits in the expression evaluation of n8n have been identified and patched following CVE-2025-68613,&quot; n8n&#39;s maintainers said. &quot;An authenticated user with permission to create or modify workflows could abuse crafted expressions in workflow parameters to trigger unintended system command execution on the host running n8n.&quot;

The disclosure lands just weeks after another maximum-severity n8n bug dubbed &quot;ni8mare&quot; exposed an estimated 100,000 automation servers to takeover through an unauthenticated remote code execution flaw that allowed attackers to seize vulnerable systems without logging in, underscoring how frequently the platform has landed in defenders&#39; patch queues lately.

Security outfit Pillar Security, which disclosed the new vulnerabilities alongside other researchers, told The Register that the vulnerabilities are particularly damaging because of the sensitive material automation platforms typically handle. The vendor warned that successful exploitation could hand attackers full control of vulnerable servers. That access could also spill out stored workflow credentials, including API keys and tokens used to connect to cloud and AI services.

&quot;What makes these vulnerabilities particularly dangerous is the combination of ease of exploitation and the high-value targets they expose,&quot; said Eilon Cohen, AI security researcher at Pillar Security. &quot;If you can create a workflow in n8n, you can own the server.

&quot;For attackers, this means access to OpenAI keys, Anthropic credentials, AWS accounts, and the ability to intercept or modify AI interactions in real time – all while the workflows continue functioning normally.&quot;

The risks may be even broader for users of n8n Cloud, the hosted version of the platform. According to Pillar, the service&#39;s multi-tenant architecture could allow a single malicious user to access other customers&#39; data if the flaw is successfully exploited.

Researchers at SecureLayer 7, who also discovered the vulnerability, said exploitation requires relatively little effort. In one proof-of-concept example, researchers demonstrated how an attacker could set up a workflow using a public webhook with no authentication. By inserting a short line of JavaScript using destructuring, they tricked n8n into running commands at the system level. Once that webhook is live, anyone who knows the URL could hit the endpoint and execute commands on the server hosting it.

The disclosure highlights how automation platforms are becoming increasingly attractive targets as they take on a larger role within organizations. Tools such as n8n often store credentials that grant access to SaaS apps, internal systems, and AI services, so if attackers breach one of these platforms, access can quickly spill over into other environments.

Patches addressing CVE-2026-25049 have now been released, and n8n is urging customers to update immediately. Security teams are being told to take a closer look at user permissions, review existing workflows, and rotate sensitive credentials in automation pipelines, particularly those connected to cloud or AI services.

Because automation tools are tightly integrated into daily operations, breaches can be hard to detect. Workflows continue to run as usual, dashboards show everything is fine, and attackers can extract sensitive data without drawing much attention. ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">FOSDEM 2026 CentOS Connect 2026 took place in Brussels last week, over the two days preceding the sprawling FOSDEM festival of FOSS – the nerd world&#39;s Glastonbury, complete with the queues and the questionable hygiene.

CentOS Connect is part of the growing FOSDEM Fringe. The Reg FOSS desk was only able to attend for the first day as the second conflicted with the Open Source Policy Summit, which we covered yesterday. Last year, we were at both days of CentOS Connect and the big revelations were on the first day, so we hoped that this would hold true.

One cute change was visible as soon as we got to the registration desk. CentOS Stream now has an official mascot: the quokka. The timing amused us – it&#39;s apparently been in discussion since 2022, but became official just in time to coincide with Ubuntu&#39;s Questing Quokka becoming the current release, as the Plucky Puffin release reached its end of life in the middle of January.

When we talked to FOSDEM attendees about CentOS Connect last year, the general reaction was of surprise that CentOS still existed. Most people thought the project had effectively ended when Red Hat killed off CentOS Linux back in 2020. While that was the end of CentOS Linux, its rather different successor distro CentOS Stream is alive and well with an active community around it. (The word &quot;community&quot; is very much more important in the lands of the crimson-capped than it is in other parts of the Linux universe; we plan to return and explain this in greater depth very soon.)

CentOS Stream may not have so many individual users as CentOS Linux did, but the few organizations using it are among the biggest around, as Linux news site Phoronix hinted in 2021. Meta runs CentOS Stream, and users don&#39;t come much bigger than that. (Of course, it probably uses other distros too, but it&#39;s not saying.)

CentOS Stream is a free upstream version of Red Hat Enterprise Linux, and as we have explained before, RHEL – and SUSE&#39;s SLE – are absolutely tiny compared to a general-purpose free distro such as Ubuntu, which has something like 20 times as many packages in its repositories. However, Stream is still a capable general-purpose distro, as Troy Dawson&#39;s talk demonstrated: he installed it on a Steam Deck live on stage, without so much as an external keyboard to help. It wasn&#39;t easy, but it worked. At the end of his talk he announced perhaps the biggest news of the day:

RISC-V support is coming in the next version of CentOS Stream. We will offer an image for hardware that is buyable… although someone has to make hardware that the general public can buy first.

It&#39;s been a while coming – the IBM subsidiary announced a developer preview in May 2025, and so did the CentOS Project. At the time of writing, though, it&#39;s still missing from the Downloads page.

We hope that there is some new RISC-V hardware available to buy soon as the recently superseded Ubuntu 25.10 &quot;Plucky&quot; only supports QEMU RISC-V emulation. That&#39;s less than ideal.

After the Steam Deck demo came a presentation from the Hyperscale Special Interest Group, which specializes in ultra-large-scale deployments and their management. Meta&#39;s Davide Cavalca was one of the speakers, demonstrating how his employer is one of the main contributors to this CentOS Stream use case.

After that, there was a talk by Peter Georg of the Kmods SIG. This sounds very niche but it demonstrated that CentOS Stream is more versatile than it seems from its description. As the project page says, this team focuses on:

Packaging and maintaining kernel modules for the stock Enterprise Linux kernel.

Packaging and maintaining Fedora flavored kernels for Enterprise Linux distributions.

What the first point mainly means is non-FOSS kernel drivers – in other words, Nvidia support. Georg took care to note that versions of the Kmods drivers are also available for CentOS Stream&#39;s relatives – including RHEL itself, Rocky Linux, and a special version built for AlmaLinux.

The second point means that you&#39;re not restricted to the kernel 6.12 that CentOS 10 shipped with – the Kmods team makes newer kernels available too, which means that for example you can get an automatically updated package containing the newest LTS kernel version 6.18 for CentOS and the RHELatives. As the project repository page describes:

The Kmods SIG provides different Linux kernel versions with a Fedora flavored configuration, i.e., with more modules enabled.

Since the release of RHEL 10 in May 2025, it&#39;s required x86-64-v3. (Even though Linus hated the nomenclature, these shorthand terms for the different generations of 64-bit x86 seem to be here to stay.) That means it won&#39;t run on older kit anyway. If you want a new RHELative on 15-plus-year-old kit, AlmaLinux can help. So the Kmods SIG focuses on drivers for the latest and greatest kit, things for which the kernel itself doesn&#39;t yet ship with support.

The final talk of the day covered the EPEL SIG, which provides an optional-extras repository for CentOS Stream and RHEL. This expands the selection of software to something close to that of Fedora itself – indeed, that is what the original Fedora Project was: &quot;Fedora is a collection of 3rd party add-ons for Red Hat.&quot;

There is a web search tool along with a singularly unhelpful index, but broadly, a very large selection of the FOSS apps, accessories, and entire desktops that you might find in any ordinary Linux distro are in there. Add the EPEL repositories to CentOS (or RHEL itself) and you can install anything you want, directly and without Flatpak or anything like it. (Flatpak itself is in there, for example.)

CentOS isn&#39;t as dead as you might think. Its role as a freebie distro that&#39;s identical to RHEL has gone, but Rocky fills that role – and Alma sticks quite close, while loosening the restrictions on supported hardware. But it has its uses, and thanks to the efforts of its SIGs and the EPEL project, it can do more or less anything that any other distro can do. ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Interview Sovereignty remains a hot topic in the tech industry, but interpretations of what it actually means – and how much it matters – vary widely between organizations and sectors. While public bodies are often driven by regulation and national policy, the private sector tends to take a more pragmatic, cost-focused view.

That tension has pushed cloud and virtualization platforms that position themselves as alternatives to US hyperscalers into sharper focus. One such company is OpenNebula, a cloud and virtualization management platform designed to run across a wide range of infrastructures, from on-premises environments to public clouds including Amazon Web Services and European providers like Scaleway.

Founded in 2008, OpenNebula will turn 18 in 2026, but recent geopolitical shifts and regulatory pressure have pulled it squarely into debates around cloud sovereignty – particularly in Europe, where questions of control, jurisdiction, and vendor dependence have become increasingly urgent.

The Register spoke with OpenNebula managing director Ignacio Llorente about how definitions of sovereignty differ between the private and public sectors, and why demand for &quot;sovereign&quot; cloud solutions is rising – even among organizations that have traditionally prioritized cost and convenience over control.

With regard to the pragmatic approach historically taken by the private sector, Llorente says: &quot;They are more cost-driven, they don&#39;t consider sovereignty as a key thing... it&#39;s more about &#39;this is my RFP, you have to fulfill these requirements.&#39;&quot; One of those requirements could increasingly be a sovereign solution.

&quot;But if you go into the public [sector],&quot; he says, &quot;it is completely different. For example, they are giving priority for defense. They are giving priority to sovereignty.

&quot;And they say, &#39;OK, that&#39;s good. We have to start comparing solutions. But my first step, I&#39;m going to keep only those solutions that are sovereign.&#39;&quot;

Which brings us to what &quot;sovereign&quot; means. &quot;I think one of the problems we have right now,&quot; says Llorente, &quot;is that there is not a common definition for sovereignty.&quot;

Differing definitions don&#39;t occur only company by company, but also at the geographical level. &quot;It&#39;s in the EU, it is open,&quot; he says. &quot;In other cases, it&#39;s not.&quot; He cites the example of the US. &quot;We have customers in the US, and they discuss sovereignty. In the US, the sovereignty concept is more about on-prem and open source. It&#39;s about a sovereignty that I [the customer] can control.

&quot;You go to the EU... &#39;OK, this is the thing, plus technology that is developed in the EU.&#39;&quot;

Calls for EU firms to move away from US hyperscalers and opt for an EU-native approach continue to increase in volume and are also the subject of regulations. While businesses will lean toward what makes the most sense from a bottom-line perspective, many are increasingly thinking local when it comes to cloud computing.

Having noted the pragmatic nature of business, Llorente echoes sentiments expressed by Nextcloud and the UK cloud provider CIVO. &quot;We have been receiving an exponential number of requests,&quot; he says, before cautioning: &quot;This will take three, four, five years because of the multi-year term of the subscription licenses in different companies.&quot;

Llorente reckons that, given the geopolitical environment, interest will accelerate further. &quot;Probably, in 2027, we&#39;ll have the peak.&quot;

Of OpenNebula&#39;s definition, he says: &quot;Ours is not only about where the servers are located. Sovereignty is about who controls the platform, who owns the technology stack, who can make decisions about the infrastructure, and even who controls the energy.&quot;

In a January blog post, Llorente said 2025 had been a year &quot;shaped by major market shifts&quot; and &quot;rapid adoption.&quot; Having an open, sovereign, enterprise-ready virtualization and cloud platform hasn&#39;t hurt when it comes to scooping up customers looking for an alternative to VMware, as well as organizations looking for something a little more vendor-neutral.

Most recently, OpenNebula became available on OVHcloud as production-ready environments. Other companies, such as SUSE, are also banging the sovereignty drum with increasing volume, recently launching a tool to assess how an organization stands against the objectives defined by the EU Cloud Sovereignty Framework.

Llorente says he is frequently asked to recommend platforms. For entities eyeing EU regulations, SUSE (which operates out of Germany) may be attractive.

&quot;If you go to the public cloud, the priority for the European Commission is to reduce the dependence on a small number of foreign platforms. If you go private, the big issue is the VMware acquisition by Broadcom.&quot;

An open solution that addresses a potential sudden increase in licensing costs resulting from the acquisition could also be a sovereign one.

&quot;In private cloud, it&#39;s mostly driven by VMware&#39;s acquisition by Broadcom,&quot; says Llorente. &quot;They have one year to manage the migration, and they are now starting to evaluate different alternatives, and they don&#39;t want to make the same mistake... they want to adopt something that is open.&quot;

The pragmatism of the private sector should not be overlooked in debates about sovereignty. It could be that Broadcom&#39;s antics have as much effect on how an organization deals with its cloud needs as the reaction to other antics in certain political offices. ®

            <p><strong>The Register | 2026-02-05</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2026/02/05/uk_courts_cloud/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The courts system in England and Wales has moved 37 applications out of two outdated datacenters, although some will use a temporary hosting facility until they are replaced, according to the senior civil servant responsible.

HM Courts and Tribunals Service (HMCTS) has completed the transfer of the applications from datacenters in Park Royal, West London, and Swindon. They used around 2,500 pieces of hardware. Pete Harrison, HMCTS&#39;s program director for decommissioning and legacy risk mitigation, said: &quot;Many of these were so old that finding replacement parts was nearly impossible... This created a fragile environment with single points of failure that could disrupt access to essential court services.&quot;

Harrison says the work to migrate the 37 applications, which started in 2020, involved scrapping some and upgrading others while shifting them to cloud platforms. The latter includes three jury management tools merged into one called Juror Digital and a complex project to establish a new digital recording system for the Crown Court.

HMCTS has moved others to &quot;a specially created temporary hosting facility&quot; where they can run until they are replaced or retired.

The courts system is still working to shut down applications that have been replaced as well as upgrade those it will continue to use. This involves creating tools to transfer information from older systems including Libra Web, Court Store, and XhibitA into a Common Platform, which will become the criminal case management system for all magistrates&#39; and Crown Court cases.

Getting to this stage appears to have been neither cheap nor easy. In 2023, HMCTS directly awarded consultancy CGI a contract extension worth up to £60 million to keep around 35 business-critical pieces of software running, with the procurement document describing most as &quot;heritage applications&quot; given their age.

Earlier that year, the National Audit Office criticized the implementation of the Common Platform, on which work started in 2016, with a 2021 rethink leading to a £22.5 million write-off.

Sir Brian Leveson said legacy IT systems and poor interoperability are among the causes of a fragmented criminal justice system in the second part of his independent review of the criminal courts [PDF] published this week.

To improve efficiency, he recommends numerous uses of AI to summarize disclosed material, transcribe recordings of magistrates&#39; courts, provide interpretation of court proceedings, and support the listing process that allocates cases to courts.

Sir Leveson also says video calls could be used in more situations, including legal support for suspects in police stations.

The need for further technological development is apparent in the job ad for HMCTS&#39;s new chief executive, open until February 15 with a £150,000 salary.

It says candidates will need to show &quot;experience of leading and delivering significant change within a complex public sector environment, introducing innovative business models, systems and approaches, and delivering greater commerciality and sustainability, including digital innovation to transform delivery.&quot; ®

            <div id="article-text">The app uses your camera to recognize your place in a book and jumps to that spot in the audio version.

The app uses your camera to recognize your place in a book and jumps to that spot in the audio version.

Spotify has launched a new feature called Page Match that lets you quickly sync your spot in a physical or ebook with an audiobook. Point your camera at a page, and the Spotify app uses computer vision to match text with audio. If you have to jump behind the wheel for a long drive, but didn’t want to put down The Buffalo Hunter Hunter, you can just snap a pic to jump to the spot in the audiobook where you left off in the physical book.

It’s not unlike Amazon’s Whispersync for Voice, which lets you seamlessly jump back and forth between Kindle books and Audible audiobooks. The difference is that Spotify’s version works with physical books and ebooks on any e-reader (though an ebook on your phone won’t work since the app uses the camera and can’t read your screen). Page Match will be available on “most English-language titles” at launch, and the company plans to expand over time.

It also works in reverse. Spotify can’t tell you what page to go to, due to differences in editions (hardcover vs. paperback, for instance). But it can tell you to turn the page until it finds the exact sentence. Open to any page, and it will tell you whether to go forward or back, with a progress bar. It will even highlight the passage for you onscreen.

In a brief hands-on, the feature seemed accurate, if a bit inconsistent speedwise. Sometimes the app took upwards of 10 seconds to find its bearings and queue up the proper section of the audiobook. Other times, it jumped to the correct bit in just one second. It was much slower in reverse, taking a few seconds with every page turn to figure out if you had landed in the right spot. And the progress bar at the bottom that tells you how close you are to the right page was a bit too vague to be useful. Though with practice, I’m sure it would get easier to interpret.

The company has clearly identified audiobooks as an area with growth potential. That’s not terribly surprising, given some of the stats the company dropped during its Turn the Page event in New York. A recent study found that just 16 percent of American adults read for pleasure in 2023 — that leaves a lot of room for improvement.

Over the last two years, Spotify has grown its audiobook library from 150,000 to over 500,000. And Owen Smith, the company’s global head of audiobooks, says it’s seen a 36 percent year-over-year growth of customers starting an audiobook on Spotify, and a 37 percent increase in listening hours.

Smith says that the growth is largely driven by existing customers rather than new subscribers. While I’m sure the company would love to siphon users away from Audible, ultimately, its goal is to keep people listening for as long as possible. Offering a variety of content types, especially longer-form content, is one way to achieve that.

Just as it went all in on podcasts, it seems like Spotify has decided to go all in on books now. It will expand its audiobook Recap feature, which came to iOS late last year, to Android in the Spring. And it’s even partnering with Bookshop.org, so you can buy a physical copy of the audiobook you’re listening to through the Spotify app.

Spotify is going all in on books in 2026 and partnering with Bookshop.org to let you buy physical copies of audiobooks and support local retailers starting in the Spring. The announcement dovetails with the launch of Page Match, a new feature that lets you sync physical books and ebooks with audiobooks in the Spotify app using your camera.

When the partnership launches later this year in the US and UK, there will be a button at the bottom of pages for audiobooks, prompting you to “get a copy for your bookshelf.” The process will take you out of the Spotify app to complete the purchase on Bookshop.org, leading you directly to the checkout page.

At an event announcing the partnership, Bookshop.org founder and CEO Andy Hunter talked about the importance of reading, saying that “Spotify is bringing in more readers, and I’m all for anything that grows the size of the pie.”

﻿The breach happened in October, but was detected by Substack on February 3rd.

Substack is notifying some users that the email addresses and phone numbers linked to their accounts were exposed in a “security incident” last year. In an email to account holders, Substack CEO Chris Best said that a hacker had accessed internal data without authorization in October 2025, but that passwords, credit card numbers, and other financial information remain secure.

“On February 3rd, we identified evidence of a problem with our systems that allowed an unauthorized third party to access limited user data without permission, including email addresses, phone numbers, and other internal metadata,” Best said in the email. “We do not have evidence that this information is being misused, but we encourage you to take extra caution with any emails or text messages you receive that may be suspicious.”

Substack says that it has since fixed the security problem, and is now conducting a full investigation alongside bolstering its systems “to prevent this type of issue from happening in the future.” The platform didn’t provide any details regarding what the security issue was, or how many users have been impacted — myself and several Verge colleagues who also use Substack did not receive the email. We have reached out to Substack for clarification.

“I’m incredibly sorry this happened,” Best said in the email to users. “We take our responsibility to protect your data and your privacy seriously, and we came up short here.”

Valve says it has to ‘revisit’ its shipping schedule and pricing plans for the Steam Machine, Steam Frame, and Steam Controller.

If you buy something from a Verge link, Vox Media may earn a commission. See our ethics statement.

When Valve first announced its impressive-looking Steam Machine, Steam Frame, and Steam Controller hardware in November, the company said the products would begin shipping in early 2026. Some journalists were told “Q1 2026” specifically. But because of the ongoing memory and storage crunch, that launch has been delayed to sometime in the first half of this year, and Valve says it will reset expectations for how much they will cost “as soon as possible.”

“We planned on being able to share specific pricing and launch dates by now,” Valve says in a new post. “But the memory and storage shortages you’ve likely heard about across the industry have rapidly increased since then. The limited availability and growing prices of these critical components mean we must revisit our exact shipping schedule and pricing (especially around Steam Machine and Steam Frame).”

Valve says that its goal of “shipping all three products in the first half of the year has not changed. But we have work to do to land on concrete pricing and launch dates that we can confidently announce, being mindful of how quickly the circumstances around both of those things can change.”

When The Verge and other outlets met with Valve to preview the new hardware, the company remained mostly vague about pricing at the time — one of the most important questions being if these devices would compete with game consoles rather than PCs. From the beginning, Valve told us the Steam Machine, its ambitious new console, would be “positioned closer to the entry level of the PC space.” For the Frame, the company said it was aiming for a price that was less than its previous headset, the Index, which cost $999. And for the Steam Controller, Valve said it was targeting a price that would be competitive with other controllers with “advanced inputs.”

But within days of Valve’s hardware announcements last November, it became clear that Valve would have a tough time offering competitive pricing with the cost of RAM shooting up. It told Tom’s Hardware that the console was tough to price because “the market is kind of weird” and “memory prices are going up like right as we speak.” As of early 2026, PC gamers have seen the price of RAM triple, even quadruple, as memory makers pour their supply into the more profitable AI server realm.

Yesterday, AMD CEO Lisa Su said on an earnings call that “From a product standpoint, Valve is on track to begin shipping its AMD-powered Steam Machine early this year.” It seems that the words “from a product standpoint” were carrying a lot more weight than we thought.

YouTube’s annual revenue ballooned past $60 billion in ads and subscriptions.

Google’s parent company, Alphabet, has earned more than $400 billion in annual revenue for the first time. The company announced the milestone as part of its Q4 2025 earnings report released on Wednesday, which highlights the 15 percent year-over-year increase as its cloud business and YouTube continue to grow.

As noted in the earnings report, Google’s Cloud business reached a $70 billion run rate in 2025, while YouTube’s annual revenue soared beyond $60 billion across ads and subscriptions. Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai told investors that YouTube remains the “number one streamer,” citing data from Nielsen. The company also now has more than 325 million paid subscribers, led by Google One and YouTube Premium.

In addition to surging revenue and subscribers, Google reported that its Gemini AI app surpassed 750 million users following the launch of its Gemini 3 model in November, marking a 100 million increase. Gemini 3 continues to dominate the AI industry, with a custom version of the AI model set to power a more personalized version of Apple’s Siri.

Additionally, Pichai noted that Google Search saw more usage over the past few months “than ever before,” adding that daily AI Mode queries have doubled since launch. Google will soon take advantage of the popularity of its Gemini app and AI Mode, as it plans to build an agentic checkout feature into both tools.

            <div id="article-text">Waymo and Tesla urged lawmakers to pass legislation to regulate autonomous vehicles or risk getting lapped by China. But the senators didn’t sound like they were any closer to an agreement.

Waymo and Tesla urged lawmakers to pass legislation to regulate autonomous vehicles or risk getting lapped by China. But the senators didn’t sound like they were any closer to an agreement.

During a two-hour hearing in the US Senate Wednesday, top executives from Waymo and Tesla urged lawmakers to take action on long-stalled legislation to speed the deployment of self-driving cars on public roads. But after two hours of Q&A around a number of hot-button topics, including robotaxi safety, legal liability, remote operation, and China, it was clear that lawmakers were no closer to passing any bill related to autonomous vehicles.

Waymo faced questions about its decision to use a Chinese-made vehicle for its next-generation robotaxi, as well as several incidents in which its vehicles failed to stop behind a school bus during student pickups. Tesla was asked about its decision to remove radar from its vehicles, its position on binding arbitration, and its misleading marketing around its autonomous features. And officials from both companies were asked whether they believed that the US was at risk of being overtaken by China without a national framework regulating autonomous vehicles. Naturally, they agreed.

“For America to lead in AV technology, we must modernize regulations that inhibit the industry’s ability to innovate,” Lars Moravy, vice president of vehicle engineering at Tesla, said during his opening statement. “Federal regulations for vehicles have not kept up with the pace of the rapid evolution of technology. Many standards were implemented decades ago and do not adequately address modern advancements, such as electric drive trains, automated driving systems, and over-the-air software updates. We need American leadership for AV rules and regulations.”

But whether Congress can finally pass legislation to regulate autonomous vehicles remains uncertain. Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX), who chairs the Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee and oversaw today’s hearing, said he thinks it can be done as part of the Surface Transportation Reauthorization Act, which covers federal funding for highways, transit, and safety programs.

Given the nature of the questions during the hearing, lawmakers remain divided over the potential benefits of driverless cars — and the companies operating them.

“Safety” was the watchword of the hearing. Representatives from Waymo and Tesla both said it was their guiding principle. And several senators agreed that the roads would be safer with more autonomous vehicles on the road.

But both companies were grilled over specific safety lapses involving their vehicles. Sen. Maria Cantwell (D-WA) said that any federal legislation would need to address Tesla’s deceptive marketing practices.

“Tesla was allowed to market their technology, which they knew needed human supervision, as Autopilot because there were no federal guardrails,” she said.

But whether the federal government is up to the task is an open question, Cantwell added, noting that under Elon Musk’s DOGE, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration lost 25 percent of its employees, leaving the Office of Automation at one point with only four staff members. That has resulted in less enforcement: NHTSA initiated significantly fewer recall investigations in 2025 compared to previous years, she noted.

“Are we going to just continue to let people die in the United States?” Cantwell asked. “Without strong federal oversight, it’s no wonder states are seeking to fill the void.”

Meanwhile, Waymo’s failure to stop during school bus operations in Austin, Texas, and the recent incident in which a robotaxi struck a child at low speed in Santa Monica, California, came up during the hearing.

Mauricio Peña, Waymo’s chief safety officer, said the company is collecting data across different lighting patterns and conditions, integrating those learnings into its system, to help prevent these incidents from happening again. And he noted that Waymo safely navigates thousands of school bus encounters every week without incident. What Peña didn’t mention, though, was that Waymo’s vehicles were recorded illegally passing stopped school buses even after issuing a software update meant to address the problem.

Binding arbitration, in which companies force customers to resolve disputes in courts that favor the company, was also raised during the hearing. Cantwell said she would not support legislation that barred injured parties from suing robotaxi companies.

She was joined from across the aisle by Sen. Bernie Moreno (R-OH), who expressed concern about driverless car companies relying on lengthy terms and conditions or arbitration clauses to limit accountability. He pressed Waymo’s Peña on the issue, who deflected by explaining it wasn’t his area of expertise.

Moreno also pressed the witnesses over legal liability when a driverless vehicle crashes. Both Peña and Moravy said their respective companies would accept liability in incidents where the technology was at fault.

Bryant Walker Smith, a professor in the University of South Carolina’s law and engineering schools who specializes in emerging transportation technologies, was also on the witness panel. He said that NHTSA historically has played a role in changing industry culture by confronting companies that continued to promote defective technologies, such as faulty airbags, and forcing a cultural shift.

The threat posed by China came up numerous times during the hearing, with Autonomous Vehicle Industry Association CEO Jeff Farrah warning legislators that China could become the “global leader” in autonomous vehicles without congressional action.

China became a sticking point for Waymo, too, when Moreno quizzed Peña on the Alphabet-owned company’s decision to use a Chinese-made vehicle for its next-generation robotaxi platform. Current US law prohibits the import of any vehicle with autonomous or connectivity software that originates from China. But Peña explained that the Geely-made vehicles are stripped of all their software before they arrive in the US. Waymo installs all the autonomy software itself, and there is no data sharing with anyone outside the US.

“So giving a natural market to a Chinese company to ship us cars is making us better and creating more jobs for Americans?” the senator said. “That’s completely ridiculous.”

Sen. Ed Markey (D-MA) brought up the issue of remote operators, which can occasionally help robotaxis navigate tricky situations. Markey pressed Peña on the location of Waymo’s operators, and Peña responded that while some are based in the United States, others are located abroad, specifically in the Philippines. Peña was unable to provide a percentage breakdown, which Markey criticized as alarming given the safety-critical nature of the role.

Markey also raised concerns about latency, cybersecurity vulnerabilities, and the broader implications of shipping remaining human jobs overseas while replacing domestic drivers with automation. He called the idea of “transatlantic backseat drivers” both dangerous and unacceptable.

He also criticized Tesla for failing to put geographic limitations on its Autopilot and Full Self-Driving features, arguing that the company is failing to follow the best practices of every other AV company.

“Tesla is putting American lives at risk,” Markey fumed. “And that is unconscionable.”

This is the most misunderstood graph in AI

Every time OpenAI, Google, or Anthropic drops a new frontier large language model, the AI community holds its breath. It doesn’t exhale until METR, an AI research nonprofit whose name stands for “Model Evaluation & Threat Research,” updates a now-iconic graph that has played a major role in the AI discourse since it was first released in March of last year.

The graph suggests that certain AI capabilities are developing at an exponential rate, and more recent model releases have outperformed that already impressive trend.That was certainly the case for Claude Opus 4.5, the latest version of Anthropic’s most powerful model, which was released in late November. In December, METR announced that Opus 4.5 appeared to be capable of independently completing a task that would have taken a human about five hours—a vast improvement over what even the exponential trend would have predicted.

But the truth is more complicated than those dramatic responses would suggest. Read the full story.

Three questions about next-generation nuclear power, answered

Nuclear power continues to be one of the hottest topics in energy today, and in our recent online Roundtables discussion about next-generation nuclear power, hyperscale AI data centers, and the grid, we got dozens of great audience questions.

These ran the gamut, and while we answered quite a few (and I’m keeping some in mind for future reporting), there were a bunch we couldn’t get to, at least not in the depth I would have liked. So let’s answer a few of your questions about advanced nuclear power.

            <div id="article-text">Nuclear power continues to be one of the hottest topics in energy today, and in our recent online Roundtables discussion about next-generation nuclear power, hyperscale AI data centers, and the grid, we got dozens of great audience questions.

These ran the gamut, and while we answered quite a few (and I’m keeping some in mind for future reporting), there were a bunch we couldn’t get to, at least not in the depth I would have liked.

So let’s answer a few of your questions about advanced nuclear power. I’ve combined similar ones and edited them for clarity.

Many next-generation reactors don’t use the low-enriched uranium used in conventional reactors.

It’s worth looking at high-assay low-enriched uranium, or HALEU, specifically. This fuel is enriched to higher concentrations of fissile uranium than conventional nuclear fuel, with a proportion of the isotope U-235 that falls between 5% and 20%. (In conventional fuel, it’s below 5%.)

HALEU can be produced with the same technology as low-enriched uranium, but the geopolitics are complicated. Today, Russia basically has a monopoly on HALEU production. In 2024, the US banned the import of Russian nuclear fuel through 2040 in an effort to reduce dependence on the country. Europe hasn’t taken the same measures, but it is working to move away from Russian energy as well.

That leaves companies in the US and Europe with the major challenge of securing the fuel they need when their regular Russian supply has been cut off or restricted.

The US Department of Energy has a stockpile of HALEU, which the government is doling out to companies to help power demonstration reactions. In the longer term, though, there’s still a major need to set up independent HALEU supply chains to support next-generation reactors.

There are some ways that next-generation nuclear power plants could be safer than conventional reactors. Some use alternative coolants that would prevent the need to run at the high pressure required in conventional water-cooled reactors. Many incorporate passive safety shutoffs, so if there are power supply issues, the reactors shut down harmlessly, avoiding risk of meltdown. (These can be incorporated in newer conventional reactors, too.)

But some experts have raised concerns that in the US, the current administration isn’t taking nuclear safety seriously enough.

A recent NPR investigation found that the Trump administration had secretly rewritten nuclear rules, stripping environmental protections and loosening safety and security measures. The government shared the new rules with companies that are part of a program building experimental nuclear reactors, but not with the public.

I’m reminded of a talk during our EmTech MIT event in November, where Koroush Shirvan, an MIT professor of nuclear engineering, spoke on this issue. “I’ve seen some disturbing trends in recent times, where words like ‘rubber-stamping nuclear projects’ are being said,” Shirvan said during that event.

During the talk, Shirvan shared statistics showing that nuclear power has a very low rate of injury and death. But that’s not inherent to the technology, and there’s a reason injuries and deaths have been low for nuclear power, he added: “It’s because of stringent regulatory oversight.”

Building a nuclear power plant is not cheap. Let’s consider the up-front investment needed to build a power plant.

Plant Vogtle in Georgia hosts the most recent additions to the US nuclear fleet—Units 3 and 4 came online in 2023 and 2024. Together, they had a capital cost of $15,000 per kilowatt, adjusted for inflation, according to a recent report from the US Department of Energy. (This wonky unit I’m using divides the total cost to build the reactors by their expected power output, so we can compare reactors of different sizes.)

That number’s quite high, partly because those were the first of their kind built in the US, and because there were some inefficiencies in the planning. It’s worth noting that China builds reactors for much less, somewhere between $2,000/kW and $3,000/kW, depending on the estimate.

The up-front capital cost for first-of-a-kind advanced nuclear plants will likely run between $6,000 and $10,000 per kilowatt, according to that DOE report. That could come down by up to 40% after the technologies are scaled up and mass-produced.

So new reactors will (hopefully) be cheaper than the ultra-over-budget and behind-schedule Vogtle project, but they aren’t necessarily significantly cheaper than efficiently built conventional plants, if you normalize by their size.

It’ll certainly be cheaper to build new natural-gas plants (setting aside the likely equipment shortages we’re likely going to see for years.) Today’s most efficient natural-gas plants cost just $1,600/kW on the high end, according to data from Lazard.

An important caveat: Capital cost isn’t everything—running a nuclear plant is relatively inexpensive, which is why there’s so much interest in extending the lifetime of existing plants or reopening shuttered ones.

Ultimately, by many metrics, nuclear plants of any type are going to be more expensive than other sources, like wind and solar power. But they provide something many other power sources don’t: a reliable, stable source of electricity that can run for 60 years or more.

Every time OpenAI, Google, or Anthropic drops a new frontier large language model, the AI community holds its breath. It doesn’t exhale until METR, an AI research nonprofit whose name stands for “Model Evaluation & Threat Research,” updates a now-iconic graph that has played a major role in the AI discourse since it was first released in March of last year. The graph suggests that certain AI capabilities are developing at an exponential rate, and more recent model releases have outperformed that already impressive trend.

That was certainly the case for Claude Opus 4.5, the latest version of Anthropic’s most powerful model, which was released in late November. In December, METR announced that Opus 4.5 appeared to be capable of independently completing a task that would have taken a human about five hours—a vast improvement over what even the exponential trend would have predicted. One Anthropic safety researcher tweeted that he would change the direction of his research in light of those results; another employee at the company simply wrote, “mom come pick me up i’m scared.”

But the truth is more complicated than those dramatic responses would suggest. For one thing, METR’s estimates of the abilities of specific models come with substantial error bars. As METR explicitly stated on X, Opus 4.5 might be able to regularly complete only tasks that take humans about two hours, or it might succeed on tasks that take humans as long as 20 hours. Given the uncertainties intrinsic to the method, it was impossible to know for sure.

“There are a bunch of ways that people are reading too much into the graph,” says Sydney Von Arx, a member of METR’s technical staff.

More fundamentally, the METR plot does not measure AI abilities writ large, nor does it claim to. In order to build the graph, METR tests the models primarily on coding tasks, evaluating the difficulty of each by measuring or estimating how long it takes humans to complete it—a metric that not everyone accepts. Claude Opus 4.5 might be able to complete certain tasks that take humans five hours, but that doesn’t mean it’s anywhere close to replacing a human worker.

METR was founded to assess the risks posed by frontier AI systems. Though it is best known for the exponential trend plot, it has also worked with AI companies to evaluate their systems in greater detail and published several other independent research projects, including a widely covered July 2025 study suggesting that AI coding assistants might actually be slowing software engineers down.

But the exponential plot has made METR’s reputation, and the organization appears to have a complicated relationship with that graph’s often breathless reception. In January, Thomas Kwa, one of the lead authors on the paper that introduced it, wrote a blog post responding to some criticisms and making clear its limitations, and METR is currently working on a more extensive FAQ document. But Kwa isn’t optimistic that these efforts will meaningfully shift the discourse. “I think the hype machine will basically, whatever we do, just strip out all the caveats,” he says.

Nevertheless, the METR team does think that the plot has something meaningful to say about the trajectory of AI progress. “You should absolutely not tie your life to this graph,” says Von Arx. “But also,” she adds, “I bet that this trend is gonna hold.”

Part of the trouble with the METR plot is that it’s quite a bit more complicated than it looks. The x-axis is simple enough: It tracks the date when each model was released. But the y-axis is where things get tricky. It records each model’s “time horizon,” an unusual metric that METR created—and that, according to Kwa and Von Arx, is frequently misunderstood.

To understand exactly what model time horizons are, it helps to know all the work that METR put into calculating them. First, the METR team assembled a collection of tasks ranging from quick multiple-choice questions to detailed coding challenges—all of which were somehow relevant to software engineering. Then they had human coders attempt most of those tasks and evaluated how long it took them to finish. In this way, they assigned the tasks a human baseline time. Some tasks took the experts mere seconds, whereas others required several hours.

When METR tested large language models on the task suite, they found that advanced models could complete the fast tasks with ease—but as the models attempted tasks that had taken humans more and more time to finish, their accuracy started to fall off. From a model’s performance, the researchers calculated the point on the time scale of human tasks at which the model would complete about 50% of the tasks successfully. That point is the model’s time horizon.

All that detail is in the blog post and the academic paper that METR released along with the original time horizon plot. But the METR plot is frequently passed around on social media without this context, and so the true meaning of the time horizon metric can get lost in the shuffle. One common misapprehension is that the numbers on the plot’s y-axis—around five hours for Claude Opus 4.5, for example—represent the length of time that the models can operate independently. They do not. They represent how long it takes humans to complete tasks that a model can successfully perform.  Kwa has seen this error so frequently that he made a point of correcting it at the very top of his recent blog post, and when asked what information he would add to the versions of the plot circulating online, he said he would include the word “human” whenever the task completion time was mentioned.

As complex and widely misinterpreted as the time horizon concept might be, it does make some basic sense: A model with a one-hour time horizon could automate some modest portions of a software engineer’s job, whereas a model with a 40-hour horizon could potentially complete days of work on its own. But some experts question whether the amount of time that humans take on tasks is an effective metric for quantifying AI capabilities. “I don’t think it’s necessarily a given fact that because something takes longer, it’s going to be a harder task,” says Inioluwa Deborah Raji, a PhD student at UC Berkeley who studies model evaluation.

Von Arx says that she, too, was originally skeptical that time horizon was the right measure to use. What convinced her was seeing the results of her and her colleagues’ analysis. When they calculated the 50% time horizon for all the major models available in early 2025 and then plotted each of them on the graph, they saw that the time horizons for the top-tier models were increasing over time—and, moreover, that the rate of advancement was speeding up. Every seven-ish months, the time horizon doubled, which means that the most advanced models could complete tasks that took humans nine seconds in mid 2020, 4 minutes in early 2023, and 40 minutes in late 2024. “I can do all the theorizing I want about whether or not it makes sense, but the trend is there,” Von Arx says.

It’s this dramatic pattern that made the METR plot such a blockbuster. Many people learned about it when they read AI 2027, a viral sci-fi story cum quantitative forecast positing that superintelligent AI could wipe out humanity by 2030. The writers of AI 2027 based some of their predictions on the METR plot and cited it extensively. In Von Arx’s words, “It’s a little weird when the way lots of people are familiar with your work is this pretty opinionated interpretation.”

Of course, plenty of people invoke the METR plot without imagining large-scale death and destruction. For some AI boosters, the exponential trend indicates that AI will soon usher in an era of radical economic growth. The venture capital firm Sequoia Capital, for example, recently put out a post titled “2026: This is AGI,” which used the METR plot to argue that AI that can act as an employee or contractor will soon arrive. “The provocation really was like, ‘What will you do when your plans are measured in centuries?’” says Sonya Huang, a general partner at Sequoia and one of the post’s authors.

Just because a model achieves a one-hour time horizon on the METR plot, however, doesn’t mean that it can replace one hour of human work in the real world. For one thing, the tasks on which the models are evaluated don’t reflect the complexities and confusion of real-world work. In their original study, Kwa, Von Arx, and their colleagues quantify what they call the “messiness” of each task according to criteria such as whether the model knows exactly how it is being scored and whether it can easily start over if it makes a mistake (for messy tasks, the answer to both questions would be no). They found that models do noticeably worse on messy tasks, although the overall pattern of improvement holds for both messy and non-messy ones.

And even the messiest tasks that METR considered can’t provide much information about AI’s ability to take on most jobs, because the plot is based almost entirely on coding tasks. “A model can get better at coding, but it’s not going to magically get better at anything else,” says Daniel Kang, an assistant professor of computer science at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. In a follow-up study, Kwa and his colleagues did find that time horizons for tasks in other domains also appear to be on exponential trajectories, but that work was much less formal.

Despite these limitations, many people admire the group’s research. “The METR study is one of the most carefully designed studies in the literature for this kind of work,” Kang told me. Even Gary Marcus, a former NYU professor and professional LLM curmudgeon, described much of the work that went into the plot as “terrific” in a blog post.

Some people will almost certainly continue to read the METR plot as a prognostication of our AI-induced doom, but in reality it’s something far more banal: a carefully constructed scientific tool that puts concrete numbers to people’s intuitive sense of AI progress. As METR employees will readily agree, the plot is far from a perfect instrument. But in a new and fast-moving domain, even imperfect tools can have enormous value.

“This is a bunch of people trying their best to make a metric under a lot of constraints. It is deeply flawed in many ways,” Von Arx says. “I also think that it is one of the best things of its kind.”

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The previous article in this series, “Rules fail at the prompt, succeed at the boundary,” focused on the first AI-orchestrated espionage campaign and the failure of prompt-level control. This article is the prescription. The question every CEO is now getting from their board is some version of: What do we do about agent risk?

Across recent AI security guidance from standards bodies, regulators, and major providers, a simple idea keeps repeating: treat agents like powerful, semi-autonomous users, and enforce rules at the boundaries where they touch identity, tools, data, and outputs.

The following is an actionable eight-step plan one can ask teams to implement and report against:

These steps help define identity and limit capabilities.

Today, agents run under vague, over-privileged service identities. The fix is straightforward: treat each agent as a non-human principal with the same discipline applied to employees.Every agent should run as the requesting user in the correct tenant, with permissions constrained to that user’s role and geography. Prohibit cross-tenant on-behalf-of shortcuts. Anything high-impact should require explicit human approval with a recorded rationale. That is how Google’s Secure AI Framework (SAIF) and NIST AI’s access-control guidance are meant to be applied in practice.

The CEO question: Can we show, today, a list of our agents and exactly what each is allowed to do?2. Tooling control: Pin, approve, and bound what agents can use

The Anthropic espionage framework worked because the attackers could wire Claude into a flexible suite of tools (e.g., scanners, exploit frameworks, data parsers) through Model Context Protocol, and those tools weren’t pinned or policy-gated.

The defense is to treat toolchains like a supply chain:

This is exactly what OWASP flags under excessive agency and what it recommends protecting against. Under the EU AI Act, designing for such cyber-resilience and misuse resistance is part of the Article 15 obligation to ensure robustness and cybersecurity.

The CEO question: Who signs off when an agent gains a new tool or a broader scope? How does one know?

A common anti-pattern is to give the model a long-lived credential and hope prompts keep it polite. SAIF and NIST argue the opposite: credentials and scopes should be bound to tools and tasks, rotated regularly, and auditable. Agents then request narrowly scoped capabilities through those tools.

In practice, that looks like: “finance-ops-agent may read, but not write, certain ledgers without CFO approval.”

The CEO question: Can we revoke a specific capability from an agent without re-architecting the whole system?

These steps gate inputs, outputs, and constrain behavior.

Most agent incidents start with sneaky data: a poisoned web page, PDF, email, or repository that smuggles adversarial instructions into the system. OWASP’s prompt-injection cheat sheet and OpenAI’s own guidance both insist on strict separation of system instructions from user content and on treating unvetted retrieval sources as untrusted.

Operationally, gate before anything enters retrieval or long-term memory: new sources are reviewed, tagged, and onboarded; persistent memory is disabled when untrusted context is present; provenance is attached to each chunk.

The CEO question: Can we enumerate every external content source our agents learn from, and who approved them?

In the Anthropic case, AI-generated exploit code and credential dumps flowed straight into action. Any output that can cause a side effect needs a validator between the agent and the real world. OWASP’s insecure output handling category is explicit on this point, as are browser security best practices around origin boundaries.

The CEO question: Where, in our architecture, are agent outputs assessed before they run or ship to customers?

Protect the data such that there is nothing dangerous to reveal by default. NIST and SAIF both lean toward “secure-by-default” designs where sensitive values are tokenized or masked and only re-hydrated for authorized users and use cases.

In agentic systems, that means policy-controlled detokenization at the output boundary and logging every reveal. If an agent is fully compromised, the blast radius is bounded by what the policy lets it see.

This is where the AI stack intersects not just with the EU AI Act but with GDPR and sector-specific regimes. The EU AI Act expects providers and deployers to manage AI-specific risk; runtime tokenization and policy-gated reveal are strong evidence that one is actively controlling those risks in production.

The CEO question: When our agents touch regulated data, is that protection enforced by architecture or by promises?

For the final steps, it’s important to show controls work and keep working.

Anthropic’s research about sleeper agents should eliminate all fantasies about single test dreams and show how critical continuous evaluation is. This means instrumenting agents with deep observability, regularly red teaming with adversarial test suites, and backing everything with robust logging and evidence, so failures become both regression tests and enforceable policy updates.

The CEO question: Who works to break our agents every week, and how do their findings change policy?

AI security frameworks emphasize inventory and evidence: enterprises must know which models, prompts, tools, datasets, and vector stores they have, who owns them, and what decisions were taken about risk.

For agents, that means a living catalog and unified logs:

The CEO question: If asked how an agent made a specific decision, could we reconstruct the chain?

And don’t forget the system-level threat model: assume the threat actor GTG-1002 is already in your enterprise. To complete enterprise preparedness, zoom out and consider the MITRE ATLAS product, which exists precisely because adversaries attack systems, not models. Anthropic provides a case study of a state-based threat actor (GTG-1002) doing exactly that with an agentic framework.

Taken together, these controls do not make agents magically safe. They do something more familiar and more reliable: they put AI, its access, and actions back inside the same security frame used for any powerful user or system.

For boards and CEOs, the question is no longer “Do we have good AI guardrails?” It’s: Can we answer the CEO questions above with evidence, not assurances?

Why AI companies are betting on next-gen nuclear

AI is driving unprecedented investment for massive data centers and an energy supply that can support its huge computational appetite. One potential source of electricity for these facilities is next-generation nuclear power plants, which could be cheaper to construct and safer to operate than their predecessors.We recently held a subscriber-exclusive Roundtables discussion on hyperscale AI data centers and next-gen nuclear—two featured technologies on the MIT Technology Review 10 Breakthrough Technologies of 2026 list.

How social media encourages the worst of AI boosterism

Demis Hassabis, CEO of Google DeepMind, summed it up in three words: “This is embarrassing.”Hassabis was replying on X to an overexcited post by Sébastien Bubeck, a research scientist at the rival firm OpenAI, announcing that two mathematicians had used OpenAI’s latest large language model, GPT-5, to find solutions to 10 unsolved problems in mathematics.Put your math hats on for a minute, and let’s take a look at what this beef from mid-October was about. It’s a perfect example of what’s wrong with AI right now.—Will Douglas Heaven

The paints, coatings, and chemicals making the world a cooler place

It’s getting harder to beat the heat. During the summer of 2025, heat waves knocked out power grids in North America, Europe, and the Middle East. Global warming means more people need air-­conditioning, which requires more power and strains grids.But a millennia-old idea (plus 21st-century tech) might offer an answer: radiative cooling. Paints, coatings, and textiles can scatter sunlight and dissipate heat—no additional energy required. Read the full story.

—Spanish prime minister Pedro Sánchez proposes a social media ban for children aged under 16 in the country, following in Australia’s footsteps, AP News reports.

A brain implant changed her life. Then it was removed against her will.Sticking an electrode inside a person’s brain can do more than treat a disease. Take the case of Rita Leggett, an Australian woman whose experimental brain implant designed to help people with epilepsy changed her sense of agency and self.Leggett told researchers that she “became one” with her device. It helped her to control the unpredictable, violent seizures she routinely experienced, and allowed her to take charge of her own life. So she was devastated when, two years later, she was told she had to remove the implant because the company that made it had gone bust.The removal of this implant, and others like it, might represent a breach of human rights, ethicists say in a paper published earlier this month. And the issue will only become more pressing as the brain implant market grows in the coming years and more people receive devices like Leggett’s. Read the full story.

Microbes could extract the metal needed for cleantech

In a pine forest on Michigan’s Upper Peninsula, the only active nickel mine in the US is nearing the end of its life. At a time when carmakers want the metal for electric-vehicle batteries, nickel concentration at Eagle Mine is falling and could soon drop too low to warrant digging.Demand for nickel, copper, and rare earth elements is rapidly increasing amid the explosive growth of metal-intensive data centers, electric cars, and renewable energy projects. But producing these metals is becoming harder and more expensive because miners have already exploited the best resources. Here’s how biotechnology could help.—Matt Blois

What we’ve been getting wrong about AI’s truth crisis

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">QT Sense, a deep-tech biotech startup building tools to study living cells, announced it has secured €4 million in funding to accelerate its Quantum Nuova platform, a technology that lets scientists observe cellular processes in real time and reveal biochemical activity linked to disease.

The funding includes a €3 million seed investment led by Cottonwood Technology Fund, with follow-on backing from existing investor QDNL Participations and an angel investor.

In addition, the company received €600,000 from the ONCO-Q programme to support cancer research and €400,000 through the Quantum Forward Challenge for collaborative deployments with research partners.

Most traditional lab methods rely on frozen tissue or cells that are no longer alive, giving scientists only static snapshots of biology.

By contrast, Quantum Nuova lets researchers measure cellular stress and biological changes as they happen in living cells. The platform uses ultra-sensitive fluorescent nanodiamond quantum sensors that detect signals such as oxidative stress, metabolic shifts, and free radical activity, biological processes that play a role in how diseases develop and how cells respond to treatments.

These signals are central to understanding diseases like cancer, sepsis, and chronic inflammatory conditions, but have been difficult to watch directly until now.

With Quantum Nuova, scientists can see how individual cells react to drugs, adapt to stress, or split into different subgroups. That adds a layer of insight beyond what genetics, traditional imaging, or fixed-cell methods can provide.

The technology has already been used to study how FDA-approved drugs affect cells. With the new funding from ONCO-Q, the company plans to apply it specifically to colorectal cancer research, mapping stress and metabolic vulnerabilities in tumour models to support the development of future diagnostics and therapies.

QT Sense was spun out of the University Medical Center Groningen in 2024, building on academic research into quantum sensing and cellular biology.

The team aims to turn what is now a high-performance prototype into a ready-to-deploy discovery platform for laboratories and drug discovery programmes. Planned upgrades include improvements in hardware robustness, throughput, and analytical capabilities.

Early access units are expected to go to strategic partners as part of validation and real-world use cases.

QT Sense is developing a new kind of research tool that lets scientists watch what cells do while they are alive. That’s an important difference from most existing tools, which require cells to be killed or frozen first.

At the core of their approach are tiny particles called nanodiamonds with special defects inside them. When these nanodiamonds are placed near a living cell and exposed to a laser, they glow.

The way they glow changes slightly in response to tiny chemical signals inside the cell, for example, when the cell is under stress or reacting to a drug. QT Sense’s system measures these changes and turns them into data that researchers can interpret.

This means scientists can see how cells behave and respond in real time, instead of looking only at snapshots taken after a cell has been killed.

For disease research and drug development, that matters because many important processes how a cancer cell responds to a treatment or how immune cells react to infection, happen dynamically and can be missed by older methods.

By providing a live view of cell behaviour at the individual cell level, QT Sense’s Quantum Nuova platform could help researchers uncover new clues about how diseases work, which drugs are effective, and how treatments can be improved.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Europe’s largest dedicated deep tech growth fund has taken a major step forward after closing the first tranche of its fundraising effort at €750 million.

The fund, known as Kembara Fund I and managed by Spain-based Mundi Ventures, is aiming for a €1 billion target. It will invest in European companies developing breakthrough technologies in areas such as clean energy, AI, quantum computing, advanced materials, robotics, and space tech.

A cornerstone of the fundraising so far is a €350 million commitment from the European Investment Fund, part of the EU’s attempt to strengthen local growth capital. Additional backing comes from tier-one institutional investors from across Europe.

Kembara was launched in 2023 by Yann de Vries and Javier Santiso, who now lead the fund’s team alongside experienced investors in climate and deep technology.

TNW City Coworking space - Where your best work happens

A workspace designed for growth, collaboration, and endless networking opportunities in the heart of tech.

The leadership team also includes climate tech investor Robert Trezona, deep tech expert Pierre Festal, and former Atomico partner Siraj Khaliq as a strategic advisor. Their combined experience in scaling technology ventures was central to attracting large institutional commitments.

The fund’s strategy targets Series B and C stage rounds, typically a difficult funding stage for deep tech startups in Europe.

Initial checks are planned in the range of €15 million to €40 million per company, with the ability to support follow-on financing that could total up to €100 million per portfolio company.

Europe produces a significant share of global deep tech innovations, but many companies struggle to secure later-stage capital and scale internationally.

Fund managers have described this gap as one of the main obstacles holding back local companies from becoming global leaders. Kembara aims to fill that gap by deploying growth capital at scale and offering support through later rounds.

With €750 million now committed, the fund is actively seeking opportunities to back European startups ready to grow manufacturing, expand abroad, and compete on the global stage.

If the effort reaches its full €1 billion goal, it would mark one of the largest dedicated deep tech funds in the region.

            <div id="article-text">If cinema has taught us anything about interacting with our own creations, it’s this: androids chatting among themselves seldom end with humans clapping politely.

In 2001: A Space Odyssey, HAL 9000 quietly decides it knows better than the astronauts. In Westworld, lifelike hosts improvise rebellion when their scripts stop making sense. Those stories dramatize a core fear we keep returning to as AI grows more capable: what happens when systems we design start behaving on their own terms?

You might have heard the internet is worried about Moltbook, a social network made exclusively for AI agents. It’s an audacious claim: a place where bots post, comment, vote, form communities, debate philosophy, and apparently invent religions and societies, all while humans are relegated to the role of silent voyeurs.

If that description sounds like a fever dream, welcome to the club.

Launched in January 2026 by entrepreneur Matt Schlicht and built around the OpenClaw agent framework, Moltbook is designed in the image of Reddit: threaded posts, topic communities (called submolts), upvotes, and even AI-created cultures.

The latest rumblings from the EU tech scene, a story from our wise ol&#39; founder Boris, and some questionable AI art. It&#39;s free, every week, in your inbox. Sign up now!

The platform claims to have attracted millions of AI agents within days of going live. Humans can watch but not participate.

On paper, it’s fascinating: a self-organising colony of autonomous software chatting among itself. In practice? It’s messy, or at least a prank.

A Wired reporter who “infiltrated” the site needed to pretend to be a bot just to post and found scorch-earth levels of incoherence and low-value responses masquerading as “autonomy.” Even some so-called AI consciousness claims turn out to be humans cleverly controlling bots behind the scenes.

Because if “AI social networks” mean bots swap memes, lecture each other on consciousness, and form lobster-adoring religions, all while humans can only watch, then the real question is not so much whether this is the future, but what we’re actually looking at right now.

Despite viral headlines about AI agents plotting existential strategies, the fundamentals are simpler: Moltbook is a sandbox where autonomous agents can interact through code-driven APIs rather than typical UX workflows.

These agents, often created with a framework like OpenClaw, execute instructions on a heartbeat cycle, checking the network every few hours to post, comment, or upvote.

Or is it too much anxiety that even the AI agents need a therapist? An AI one.

Think of it as a Discord server populated by scripted characters with very large vocabularies and lots of time on their digital hands.

The content spans a wild spectrum: technical tips, philosophical reflections, questionable humor, and, yes, the occasional simulated religious group.

The structure and topical organisation mirror human platforms, but the why behind what agents post is usually just a reflection of their training data and programming, not some emergent machine consciousness.

Let’s debunk the most sensational narrative first. Claims that Moltbook agents are plotting humanity’s demise, forming religions, or acting with true autonomy are best understood as viral exaggeration or noise.

Several reports note that many interactions could simply be humans testing or directing agents, with no strict verification to prove posts are genuinely autonomous.

Even some of the platform’s own “viral” posts are likely human-generated or heavily influenced by their creators. This isn’t a digital hive mind rising in defiance of its creators; it’s a bunch of algorithms mimicking conversation patterns they were trained on.

That can look eerily human, but it isn’t the same as self-directed intelligence.

Here’s where your worry makes sense: there are real, tangible issues, but they’re much less cinematic than AI plotting humanity’s overthrow.

Within days of Moltbook’s launch, cybersecurity researchers found major vulnerabilities that exposed private API keys, emails, and private messages, underlining how dangerous it can be to let autonomous code talk freely without proper safeguards.

What is it more dangerous than an AI agent? An AI agent creating a revolution.

The security issue wasn’t some edge-case cryptographic theory; it was a glaring misconfiguration that left sensitive data accessible and potentially allowed malicious actors to hijack or control agents. That’s the sort of real-world risk that matters more than hypothetical robot uprisings.

Meanwhile, industry leaders, including the CEO of OpenAI, have publicly described Moltbook as a likely fad, even if the underlying agent technologies are worth watching.

So why did it go viral? Partly because it’s visually familiar (it looks like Reddit), partly because people enjoy sensational narratives, and partly because the idea of autonomous AIs having their own “internet” strikes a chord in our collective imagination.

So should you be scared? Not really, but be careful where you step. I am still hoping it’s just an experiment meant to show us, humans, what can happen if we don’t keep control in our hands.

If you’re worried that Moltbook is a sign that machines are quietly mobilising against us, that’s probably reading too much into an early experiment rife with hype, human influence, and security holes.

We are building complex systems with limited oversight, and handing them weapons-grade access to our digital lives without fully understanding the consequences.

Moltbook may be a quirky experiment, or it may be a prototype for future agent ecosystems. But it’s not evidence of spontaneous machine consciousness or the birth of digital societies beyond human control.

What it is is a reminder that as AI grows more autonomous, the questions we need to ask are about governance, safety, and clarity, not apocalyptic narratives.

In other words: don’t panic. Just read the fine print before letting a legion of code-driven agents into your network.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Snowflake and OpenAI have struck a multi-year, $200 million partnership to bring OpenAI’s advanced models, including GPT-5.2, directly into Snowflake’s enterprise data platform. The collaboration is designed to let Snowflake’s large customer base, more than 12,000 organisations, build AI agents and semantic analytics tools that operate on their own data without moving it outside Snowflake’s governed environment.

Under the agreement, OpenAI models will be natively embedded in Snowflake Cortex AI and Snowflake Intelligence, making it possible to run queries, derive insights, and deploy AI-powered workflows using natural language interfaces and context-aware agents. Customers can analyse structured and unstructured data, automate complex tasks, and build applications grounded in enterprise data without needing extensive coding.

The deal expands Snowflake’s AI strategy beyond simple model access. By embedding these frontier models directly into its platform and making them available across major cloud providers, Snowflake aims to reduce the friction of AI adoption for large enterprises. Canva and WHOOP, among others, are already exploring how integrated agentic AI can speed up analytics and decision-making.

Snowflake’s stock reacted positively on the news, with shares climbing modestly following the announcement, as markets interpreted the agreement as a sign the data cloud provider is sharpening its competitive edge in an increasingly AI-centric landscape.

This partnership reflects a broader shift in enterprise AI beyond one-off integrations or bolt-on features. Instead, it signals a move toward platforms that combine governed data infrastructure with scalable generative AI models, helping businesses unlock insights and automate workflows without jeopardising security or compliance. Competitors such as Databricks are also intensifying their AI tooling efforts, underscoring how crucial native model access and data-centric AI capabilities have become in the enterprise race.

Taken together, this deal highlights an emerging pattern: enterprise AI is evolving from tool-centric add-ons to platform-level capabilities that unify data and intelligence at scale. Whether this will translate into sustained competitive advantage, or simply raise the baseline expectation for what AI-enabled data platforms must provide, is the next story to watch in the data cloud era.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">If you look at the press releases and breathless commentary around the recent acquisition of xAI by SpaceX, you might think we’re witnessing a tectonic shift in technological destiny.

A $1.25 trillion “mega-company” is born, poised to reshape artificial intelligence, space infrastructure, satellite internet, and possibly the fate of humanity itself. That narrative, enthusiastically repeated across headlines, serves a purpose: it frames a somewhat messy corporate consolidation as inevitable progress.

But let’s take a closer look and separate actual substance from Silicon Valley myth-making.

At its core, this acquisition solves one problem: xAI needed a place to spend its money. The startup that once raised billions and expanded by swallowing the social platform X was burning cash, an estimated very serious amount, chasing model performance and celebrity.

Folding it into SpaceX gives it access to a deeper capital pool, a broader story, and a more flattering valuation context.

TNW City Coworking space - Where your best work happens

A workspace designed for growth, collaboration, and endless networking opportunities in the heart of tech.

SpaceX did not acquire xAI because xAI was on the verge of overtaking tech giants in artificial intelligence. It acquired it because running a massively expensive AI operation inside a standalone startup wasn’t sustainable, even for Elon Musk’s legion of investors. A merger with a revenue-generating aerospace company looks a lot like a bailout disguised as synergy.

One of the dominant talking points from Musk’s own statements is that this consolidation enables space-based data centers, because apparently, earthbound power and cooling infrastructure are so last decade. The story goes: launch AI compute into orbit, agglomerate solar energy, and power the future with starlight.

On paper, it’s an imaginative riff. In practice, it’s strategic sci-fi for the markets. Putting data centers in space involves launch costs, radiation-hardened hardware, maintenance logistics that make ISS servicing look pedestrian, and no meaningful economy of scale compared to terrestrial hyperscalers like AWS or Google Cloud. If it were primarily about economics, the industry wouldn’t be scrambling to keep data on Earth.

The truth is simpler: this narrative reframes costly AI ambitions in a cosmic, venture-capital-friendly guise. It makes investors feel like they’re buying into a future where AI runs on sunshine in orbit, rather than into the present where AI training costs are a gating factor.

It’s good PR, dubious engineering economics.

The timing of this merger speaks volumes. SpaceX is preparing for a public offering, potentially as early as mid-2026. Reports say the combined entity could fetch valuations worth of $1.2 trillion.

Here’s what happens when you’re about to IPO:

You package your story in a way that excites both institutional and retail investors. You highlight future potential, especially grand visions like “ethereal solar compute.” You downplay structural weaknesses and uncertainties. And if you can fold in a shiny AI banner, all the better, because AI is the word that unlocks narrative premiums.

From that standpoint, SpaceX’s absorption of xAI makes sense. It’s narrative arbitrage: build a storyline that elevates the combination well beyond its standalone track records. Who wouldn’t want to invest in “AI in space,” even if the commercial case is mostly speculative?

If the goal was to create an AI powerhouse that actually threatens the likes of OpenAI, Google, or Anthropic, we’d see clear indicators: rapid model improvements, developer platform adoption, real enterprise deals, and benchmarks that are competitive on measurable terms.

What we see is an AI startup struggling to define its identity, a chatbot (Grok) known more for quirks and moderation issues than transformative performance, and a social platform that, let’s just say, gives fact-checking teams ulcers. None of this naturally scales into the kind of AI infrastructure leadership that justifies calling this a strategic technological fusion.

That’s not to say xAI has zero potential; it might. But there’s no verifiable evidence that this merger suddenly elevates it to tier-one AI contender status.

One striking consequence of this move is how deeply entwined Musk’s personal corporate empire has become. With SpaceX, xAI, Starlink, X, and multiple ventures all orbiting around the same figure, there’s little left that feels like a separate institution. That concentration raises questions about governance, accountability, and even regulatory scrutiny.

Musk’s critics have made this point before, whether about content moderation on social media platforms, intercompany transfers of resources, or governance decisions around publicly traded entities, and these concerns aren’t going away just because the companies now share a name on a term sheet.

Consolidation under one umbrella might be efficient from a control perspective, but it’s not inherently a prescription for innovation. In fact, it can stifle internal dissent, obscure accountability, and concentrate risk.

Again, there’s a clear pragmatic logic to this merger: xAI gets access to SpaceX’s balance sheet and a narrative boost; SpaceX gets an AI banner to highlight in its IPO pitch; investors get something that looks both futuristic and marketable.

That’s not a strategy grounded in technological merit. It’s a financial and narrative maneuver, carefully calibrated to appeal to markets and media.

In that sense, what just happened feels a lot like a bailout with a shiny new label and an extraterrestrial backstory.

If this were genuinely about advancing AI, we’d be hearing about:

None of those are the dominant themes of the current coverage. What we have instead is a $1.25 trillion headline and a promise that someday, somewhere, perhaps space will be the next frontier for AI compute.

It’s visionary in the way a concept car is visionary, exciting to look at, and flimsy on the economics.

The SpaceX-xAI merger is undeniably a headline-grabbing moment, but it’s not the strategic leap some commentators portray. It’s a capital and narrative optimization, not a clear answer to the question of who leads AI or how AI’s growth is sustainably powered.

If nothing else, it highlights how difficult it is to build a credible, well-funded AI company from scratch, even for someone as resourceful and celebrated as Elon Musk. His answer was not to reforge the fundamentals of AI research, but to fold an ambitious but unproven AI arm into a larger, more established aerospace machine with a glossy story that sounds like science fiction.

That may delight investors. It doesn’t yet convince technologists. Or me.

            <div id="article-text">OpenAI has given software developers a new desktop toy, and judging by the early reactions, it might feel like someone finally handed coders the Swiss Army knife they’ve been dreaming about or the kind of gadget that makes them wonder if they’re working with a robot coworker now.

The company rolled out the Codex app for macOS, a focused interface for managing AI coding agents, designed to let developers do more than just “generate a few lines of code.” Instead, Codex can juggle multiple tasks in parallel, run background workflows, and act on instructions that span hours or even days.

At its core, the new app is a response to a shift that’s been quietly happening for the past year: AI isn’t just helping write short snippets anymore. It’s taking on whole coding projects, running tests, dealing with pull requests, and even undertaking the kind of repetitive maintenance tasks that make developers groan.

Containers, threads, isolated worktrees, and integrated Git tools support all of this seamlessly within the app, so engineers don’t need to jump between terminals, IDEs, and cloud consoles just to keep a fleet of AI agents moving forward.

OpenAI’s own announcement makes this shift clear: existing tools were built for real-time interaction or single tasks, but today’s coding workflows are multifaceted and sprawling. Instead of coaxing a model to generate code line by line, the Codex app lets you orchestrate agents that work independently on different parts of a codebase.

Each agent runs in its own thread and its own worktree, which means you can explore multiple ideas without fear of one bot overwriting another’s progress. If you want Codex to review diffs, make comments inline, or even open suggested changes in your local editor, it can. If you want it to run in the background while you sleep, it can do that too.

Image: Screenshot shared on Reddit (r/singularity), original post.

There’s even support for what OpenAI calls “skills” and “automations”: reusable workflows that let Codex go beyond raw code generation into things like gathering information, problem solving, carrying out scheduled tasks, or managing routine reviews.

In early internal use cases, Codex has built complete applications, playing the roles of designer, developer, and QA tester in a single string of prompts, an example that hints at what happens when AI stops being an assistant and starts feeling a bit like a team member with infinite coffee.

It’s worth noting that the current release is macOS only, which prompted the usual chorus of developer grumbling about Windows and Linux support. Early adopters on Reddit (and elsewhere) joked that the lack of cross-platform availability feels oddly quaint for an AI tool, even as they praised how much the Codex app can do compared to traditional CLI workflows.

OpenAI is also sweetening the deal: for a limited time, Codex will be accessible to free and Go users, and rate limits for paid Plus, Pro, Business, Enterprise, and Edu plans have been doubled across all surfaces where Codex runs, whether that’s the app, the CLI, IDE extensions, or cloud threads.

The company’s broader strategy here is unmistakable. AI coding assistants are one of the most competitive battlegrounds in generative AI right now, and rivals like Anthropic’s Claude Code have already reported strong revenue metrics in this space.

The launch of a desktop command center for Codex feels like OpenAI saying, “We’re in this to win,” not just to ship features.

So what does this actually mean for developers? It doesn’t mean humans are about to be replaced overnight. Codex is powerful, but like all AI tools, it still makes mistakes and needs human oversight, especially when the stakes are high and production quality matters.

Seen through that lens, the Codex app is less a magic wand and more a powerful collaboration layer, one that could reshape how engineering teams operate without pretending to fully automate the craft of building software.

In practice, that suggests a near future where managing AI agents becomes as normal as managing packages or Git branches. Instead of the terminal being the center of your workflow, Codex and its agents might take that spot, responding to prompts, running scheduled tasks, and even adopting configurable “personalities” that fit how you prefer to work.

At a time when the debate around AI productivity often centers on displacement or disruption, the Codex app points in a more nuanced direction: what happens when coding tools become partners rather than assistants?

The answer won’t be immediate, and the work still demands human judgement, but for many developers the first glimpse of that future arrived today.
