            <h2>Neocities founder stuck in chatbot hell after Bing blocked 1.5 million sites</h2>
            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-02-05</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2026/02/neocities-founder-stuck-in-chatbot-hell-after-bing-blocked-1-5m-sites/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">One of the weirdest corners of the Internet is suddenly hard to find on Bing, after the search engine inexplicably started blocking approximately 1.5 million independent websites hosted on Neocities.

Founded in 2013 to archive the “aesthetic awesomeness” of GeoCities websites, Neocities keeps the spirit of the 1990s Internet alive. It lets users design free websites without relying on standardized templates devoid of personality. For hundreds of thousands of people building websites around art, niche fandoms, and special expertise—or simply seeking a place to get a little weird online—Neocities provides a blank canvas that can be endlessly personalized when compared to a Facebook page. Delighted visitors discovering these sites are more likely to navigate by hovering flashing pointers over a web of spinning GIFs than clicking a hamburger menu or infinitely scrolling.

That’s the style of Internet that Kyle Drake, Neocities’ founder, strives to maintain. So he was surprised when he noticed that Bing was curiously blocking Neocities sites last summer. At first, the issue seemed resolved by contacting Microsoft, but after receiving more recent reports that users were struggling to log in, Drake discovered that another complete block was implemented in January. Even more concerning, he saw that after delisting the front page, Bing had started pointing users to a copycat site where he was alarmed to learn they were providing their login credentials.

Monitoring stats, Drake was stunned to see that Bing traffic had suddenly dropped from about half a million daily visitors to zero. He immediately reported the issue using Bing webmaster tools. Concerned that Bing was not just disrupting traffic but possibly also putting Neocities users at risk if bad actors were gaming search results, he hoped for a prompt resolution.

“This one site that was just a copy of our front page, I didn’t know if it was a phishing attack or what it was, I was just like, ‘whoa, what the heck?’” Drake told Ars.

However, weeks went by as Drake hit wall after wall, submitting nearly a dozen tickets while trying to get past the Bing chatbot to find a support member to fix the issue. Frustrated, he tried other internal channels as well, including offering to buy ads to see if an ads team member could help.

“I tried everything,” Drake said, but nothing worked. Neocities sites remained unlisted on Bing.

Although Bing only holds about 4.5 percent of the global search engine market, Drake said it was “embarrassing” that Neocities sites can’t be discovered using the default Windows search engine. He also noted that many other search engines license Bing data, further compounding the issue.

Ultimately, it’s affecting a lot of people, Drake said, but he suspects that his support tickets are being buried in probably trillions of requests each day from people wanting to improve their Bing indexing.

“There’s probably an actual human being at Bing that actually could fix this,” Drake told Ars, but “when you go to the webmaster tools,” you’re stuck talking to an AI chatbot, and “it’s all kind of automated.”

Ars reached Microsoft for comment, and the company took action to remove some inappropriate blocks.

Within 24 hours, the Neocities front page appeared in search results, but Drake ran tests over the next few days that showed that most subdomains are still being blocked, including popular Neocities sites that should garner high rankings.

Pressed to investigate further, Microsoft confirmed that some Neocities sites were delisted for violating policies designed to keep low-quality sites out of search results.

However, Microsoft would not identify which sites were problematic or directly connect with Neocities to resolve a seemingly significant amount of ongoing site blocks that do not appear to be linked to violations. Instead, Microsoft recommended that Neocities find a way to work directly with Microsoft, despite Ars confirming that Microsoft is currently ignoring an open ticket.

For Drake, “the current state of things is unknown.” It’s hard to tell if popular Neocities sites are still being blocked or if possibly Bing’s reindexing process is slow. Microsoft declined to clarify.

He’s still hoping that Microsoft will eventually resolve all the improper blocks, making it possible for Bing users to use the search engine not just to find businesses or information but also to discover creative people making websites just for fun. With so much AI slop invading social networks and search engines, Drake sees Neocities as “one of the last bastions of human content.”

“I hope we can resolve this amicably for both of us and that this doesn’t happen again in the future,” Drake said. “It’s really important for the future of the small web, and for quality content for web surfers in an increasingly generative AI world, that creative sites made by real humans are able to get a fair shot in search engine results.”

After Drake failed to quietly resolve the issue with Bing, he felt that he had no choice but to alert users to the potential risks from Bing’s delisting.

In a blog post in late January, Drake warned that Bing had “completely blocked” all Neocities subdomains from its search index. Even worse, “Bing was also placing what appeared to be a phishing attack against Neocities on the first page of search results,” Drake said.

“This is not only bad for search results, it’s very possible that it is actively dangerous,” Drake said.

After “several” complaints, Bing eventually deranked the suspected phishing site, Drake confirmed. But Bing “declined to reverse the block or provide a clear, actionable explanation for it,” which leaves Neocities users vulnerable, he said.

Since “it’s easy to get higher pagerank than a blocked site,” Drake warned that “it is possibly only a matter of time before another concerning site appears on Bing searches for Neocities.”

The blog emphasized that Google, the platform’s biggest traffic driver, was not blocking Neocities, nor was any search engine unlinked to Bing data. Urging a boycott that may force a resolution, Drake wrote, “we are recommending that Neocities users, and the broader Internet in general, not use Bing or search engines that source their results from Bing until this issue is resolved.

“If you use Bing or Bing-powered search engines, Neocities sites will not appear in your search results, regardless of content quality, originality, or compliance with webmaster guidelines,” Drake said. “If any Neocities-like sites appear on these results, they may be active phishing attacks against Neocities and should be treated with caution.”

Drake doesn’t want to boycott Bing, but in his blog, he said that Microsoft left him no choice but public disclosure:

“We did not want to write this post. We try very hard to have a good relationship with search engine providers. We would much rather quietly resolve this issue with Bing staff and move on. But after months of attempting to engage constructively through multiple channels, it became clear that silence only harms our users. Especially those who don’t realize their sites are invisible on some search engines.”

Drake told Ars that he thinks most people don’t realize how big Neocities has gotten since its early days reviving GeoCities’ spunk. The platform hosts 1,459,700 websites that have drawn in 13 billion visitors. Over the years, it has been profiled in Wired and The New York Times, and more recently, it has become a popular hub for gaming communities, Polygon reported.

As Neocities grew, Drake told Ars that much of his focus has been on improving content moderation. He works closely with a full-time dedicated content moderation staffer to quickly take down any problematic sites within 24 hours, he said. That effort includes reviewing reports and proactively screening new sites, with Drake noting that “our name domain provider requires us to take them down within 48 hours.”

Microsoft prohibits things like scraping content that could be considered copyright infringement or automatically generating content using “garbage text” to game the rankings. It also monitors for malicious behavior like phishing, as well as for prompt injection attacks on Bing’s large language model.

It’s unclear what kind of violations Microsoft found ahead of instituting the complete block; however, Drake told Ars that he has yet to identify any content that may have triggered it. He said he would promptly remove any websites flagged by Microsoft, if he could only talk to someone who could share that information.

“Naturally, we still don’t catch 100 percent of the sites with proactive moderation, and occasionally some problematic sites do get missed,” Drake said.

Although Drake is curious to learn more about what triggered the blocks, he told Ars that it’s clear that non-violative sites are still invisible on Bing.

One of the longest-running and most popular Neocities sites, Wired Sound for Wired People, is a perfect example. The bizarre, somewhat creepy anime fanpage is “very popular” and “has a lot of links to it all over the web,” Drake said. Yet if you search for its subdomain, “fauux,” the site no longer appears in Bing search results, as of this writing, while Google reliably spits it out as the top result.

Drake said that he still believes that Bing is blocking content by mistake, but Bing’s automated support tools aren’t making it easy to defend creators who are randomly blocked by one of the world’s biggest search engines.

“We have one of the lowest ratios of crap to legitimate content, human-made content, on the Internet,” Drake said. “And it’s really frustrating to see that all these human beings making really cool sites that people want to go to are just not available on the default Windows search engine.”</div>

            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2026/02/watch-kanzi-the-bonobo-pretend-to-have-a-tea-party/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Little kids hosting make-believe tea parties is a fixture of childhood playtime and long presumed to be exclusively a human ability. Researchers at Johns Hopkins University presented evidence in a new paper published in the journal Science that a bonobo named Kanzi was also able to participate in pretending to hold a tea party. For the authors, this suggests that apes are capable of using their imagination just like human toddlers.

“It really is game-changing that their mental lives go beyond the here and now,” said co-author Christopher Krupenye. “Imagination has long been seen as a critical element of what it is to be human, but the idea that it may not be exclusive to our species is really transformative. Jane Goodall discovered that chimps make tools, and that led to a change in the definition of what it means to be human, and this, too, really invites us to reconsider what makes us special and what mental life is out there among other creatures.”

Per Krupenye et al., by the age of two, human children are able to navigate imaginary scenarios like a tea party, pretending there is real tea present even if the teapot and cups are actually empty. Cognitively speaking, it’s an example of secondary representation, because it involves decoupling an imagined or simulated state (pretending there is actual tea in the cup) with the reality (the cup is empty).

Scientists have long pondered whether other animals, notably primates, also possess such mental capacities. There is some anecdotal evidence for this. For instance, a young chimpanzee was observed dragging imaginary blocks across the floor, just as the chimp did with real wooden blocks. Some female chimps in the wild will carry and play with sticks, treating them as infants—a rudimentary form of playing with a doll. And a 2006 study found that chimps and bonobos that had been exposed to human culture would sometimes perform pretend actions, like holding a bowl to a doll’s mouth to feed it, in response to verbal prompts.

Such studies have nonetheless been met with skepticism when it comes to interpreting the behavior as evidence of animals’ ability to engage in make-believe. For instance, it’s possible the animals are responding to behavioral cues, like the direction of a gaze, to solve such tasks.

Enter Kanzi, a 43-year-old bonobo who lives at the Ape Initiative and is capable of responding to verbal prompts, either by pointing or using a lexigram of more than 300 symbols. There had also been anecdotal observations of Kanzi engaging in pretense. Krupenye et al. conducted three distinct experiments with Kanzi, each involving an 18-trial session.

In the first experiment, a scientist would offer a verbal prompt: “Kanzi, let’s play a game! Let’s find the juice!” They would then place two empty transparent cups on a table and pretend to fill them from an empty transparent pitcher, with another verbal prompt (“Kanzi, look!”). The scientist would pretend to pour the “juice” in one of the cups back into the pitcher, placing the pitcher under the table. Then they asked, “Kanzi, where’s the juice?” and recorded which cup the bonobo pointed to first.

“If Kanzi could only track reality (that both cups were empty), he should have chosen at chance between the two options, whereas if his choices were guided by stimulus enhancement, he should have selected the incorrect cup that had been ‘emptied’ above chance,” the authors wrote. “In contrast, if Kanzi could represent the pretend juice, he should have chosen above chance the cup containing the ‘imaginary’ juice, the empty cup that had not been ‘poured’ back into the pitcher. That is exactly what Kanzi did.” Kanzi selected the correct cup 34 out of 50 times (68 percent).

To rule out the possibility that Kanzi simply believed there was real juice in the empty cups, the team conducted a second experiment following a similar protocol, but with one of the cups containing real juice. Then they asked Kanzi to choose which he wanted. Kanzi chose the cup with real juice nearly 78 percent of the time (14 out of 18 trials), evidence that he could tell the difference between real and pretend juice.

Finally, the team conducted one last experiment in which an experimenter pretended to sample a grape from an empty transparent plastic container before placing the “grape” in one of two transparent jars. After they pretended to empty one of the jars, they asked Kanzi, “Where is the grape?” Kanzi chose correctly nearly 69 percent of the time (31 out of 45 trials).

While Kanzi didn’t score perfectly on the pretend tasks, “It’s extremely striking and very exciting that the data seem to suggest that apes, in their minds, can conceive of things that are not there,” co-author Amalia Bastos, now at the University of St. Andrews in Scotland, said. “Kanzi is able to generate an idea of this pretend object and at the same time know it’s not real.” Whether Kanzi’s success can be generalized to other apes without the benefit of his “enculturation” will be the focus of future research.

            <h2>Bad sleep made woman's eyelids so floppy they flipped inside out, got stuck</h2>

            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2026/02/a-womans-eyelids-flipped-inside-out-on-their-own-the-fix-was-sleep/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">A poor night’s sleep might leave you feeling like your eyelids have filled with lead—and keeping them open is the ultimate dead lift. But for some, bad sleep brings on eyelids so droopy and floppy that they can do curl ups on their own.

That was the unfortunate case for a 39-year-old woman who sought care at an ophthalmology clinic in Brooklyn, New York. She told the doctors that for six weeks she felt like she had something in her eyes, and they were watery. By the time of her appointment, her eyelids had rolled up, flipping inside-out on their own—and were staying that way. In the latest issue of the New England Journal of Medicine, doctors report her eye-opening case—and its unexpected solution.

(You can see images of her eyelids—flipped and recovered—here. The images may seem graphic to some, but they are not much worse than that kid in elementary school who would flip their eyelids just to freak everyone out for laughs. You know the one.)

In an initial exam, the doctors noted that her eyes were also bloodshot and that she was unable to fully close them. When the doctors gently tried to manually pull her eyelids upward, they were remarkably limp and curled up more.

The doctors also considered another problem the woman spoke of: She had trouble sleeping. She reported snoring at night and being tired during the day. Her eye symptoms were at their worst when she first woke up. They also noted that she had obesity.

Altogether, the doctors not only had their diagnosis, but they also had the likely culprit. The woman had floppy eyelid syndrome, which is basically exactly what it sounds like. But, despite the straightforward name, it offers a clear explanation; the condition is strongly associated with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), which is also a condition more likely to affect people with excess weight.

As such, the correct next step for addressing her floppy eyelids wasn’t eye surgery or medication—it was a referral for a sleep test.

The patient did the test, which found that while she was sleeping, she stopped breathing 27 times per hour. On the apnea–hypopnea index, that yields a diagnosis of moderate-level OSA.

With this finding, the woman started using a continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) machine, which delivers continuous air into the airway during sleep, preventing it from closing up. Along with some eye lubricants, nighttime eye patches, and a weight-loss plan, the woman’s condition rapidly improved. After two weeks, her eyelids were no longer inside out, and she could properly close her eyes. She was also sleeping better and no longer had daytime drowsiness.

Doctors don’t entirely understand the underlying mechanisms that cause floppy eyelid syndrome, and not all cases are linked to OSA. Researchers have hypothesized that genetic predispositions or anatomical anomalies may contribute to the condition. Some studies have found links to underlying connective tissue disorders. Tissue studies have clearly pointed to decreased amounts or abnormalities in the elastin fibers of the tarsal plate, the dense connective tissue in the eyelids.

For people with OSA, researchers speculate that the sleep disorder leads to hypoxic conditions (a lack of oxygen) in their tissue. This, in turn, could increase oxidative stress and reactive oxygen species in the tissue, which can spur the production of enzymes that break down elastin in the eyelid. Thus, the eyelids become lax and limp, allowing them to get into weird positions (such as inside out) and leading to chronic irritation of the eye surface.

The good news is that most people with floppy eye syndrome can manage the condition with conservative measures, such as CPAP for those with OSA, as did the woman in New York. But some may end up needing corrective surgery.</div>

            <h2>Google hints at big AirDrop expansion for Android "very soon"</h2>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">There is very little functional difference between iOS and Android these days. The systems could integrate quite well if it weren’t for the way companies prioritize lock-in over compatibility. At least in the realm of file sharing, Google is working to fix that. After adding basic AirDrop support to Pixel 10 devices last year, the company says we can look forward to seeing it on many more phones this year.

At present, the only Android phones that can initiate an AirDrop session with Apple devices are Google’s latest Pixel 10 devices. When Google announced this upgrade, it vaguely suggested that more developments would come, and it now looks like we’ll see more AirDrop support soon.

According to Android Authority, Google is planning a big AirDrop expansion in 2026. During an event at the company’s Taipei office, Eric Kay, Google’s VP of engineering for Android, laid out the path ahead.

“Last year, we launched AirDrop interoperability. In 2026, we’re going to be expanding it to a lot more devices,” Kay said. “We spent a lot of time and energy to make sure that we could build something that was compatible not only with iPhone but iPads and MacBooks. Now that we’ve proven it out, we’re working with our partners to expand it into the rest of the ecosystem, and you should see some exciting announcements coming very soon.”

Android has its own AirDrop-like feature called Quick Share (formerly Google Nearby Share), but until recently, it couldn’t communicate with Apple’s AirDrop. As we reported in November, the European Union required Apple to implement the Wi-Fi Aware standard in AirDrop, which enabled Google to add support for the Pixel 10 lineup. Google confirmed it didn’t need to work with Apple at all to make that happen.

As part of the Quick Share updates, Google has added an extension to the Play Store that allows Quick Share to operate as a full, updatable APK rather than an element of Play Services. That should make it easier to roll out new features to the entire Android ecosystem. Currently, the extension only supports a smattering of Android phones, but we can expect that list to expand as AirDrop comes to more devices this year.

With AirDrop support, Android devices can send files to iOS and macOS devices without downloading third-party apps. However, the functionality requires Apple users to enable the “Everyone for 10 minutes” connectivity option. While Google can shoehorn Android into the Wi-Fi Aware system, it cannot use Apple’s contact-based sharing options. That probably won’t change with the pending update.

Of course, “very soon” in Google-speak can mean many things. The company does like to pair Android ecosystem updates with Pixel Drops, and the next one of those is expected in March, with changes to location privacy, At a Glance, and more.</div>

            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2026/02/openai-is-hoppin-mad-about-anthropics-new-super-bowl-tv-ads/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">On Wednesday, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and Chief Marketing Officer Kate Rouch complained on X after rival AI lab Anthropic released four commercials, two of which will run during the Super Bowl on Sunday, mocking the idea of including ads in AI chatbot conversations. Anthropic’s campaign seemingly touched a nerve at OpenAI just weeks after the ChatGPT maker began testing ads in a lower-cost tier of its chatbot.

Altman called Anthropic’s ads “clearly dishonest,” accused the company of being “authoritarian,” and said it “serves an expensive product to rich people,” while Rouch wrote, “Real betrayal isn’t ads. It’s control.”

Anthropic’s four commercials, part of a campaign called “A Time and a Place,” each open with a single word splashed across the screen: “Betrayal,” “Violation,” “Deception,” and “Treachery.” They depict scenarios where a person asks a human stand-in for an AI chatbot for personal advice, only to get blindsided by a product pitch.

In one spot, a man asks a therapist-style chatbot (a woman sitting in a chair) how to communicate better with his mom. The bot offers a few suggestions, then pivots to promoting a fictional cougar-dating site called Golden Encounters.

In another spot, a skinny man looking for fitness tips instead gets served an ad for height-boosting insoles. Each ad ends with the tagline: “Ads are coming to AI. But not to Claude.” Anthropic plans to air a 30-second version during Super Bowl LX, with a 60-second cut running in the pregame, according to CNBC.

In the X posts, the OpenAI executives argue that these commercials are misleading because the planned ChatGPT ads will appear labeled at the bottom of conversational responses in banners and will not alter the chatbot’s answers.

But there’s a slight twist: OpenAI’s own blog post about its ad plans states that the company will “test ads at the bottom of answers in ChatGPT when there’s a relevant sponsored product or service based on your current conversation,” meaning the ads will be conversation-specific.

The financial backdrop explains some of the tension over ads in chatbots. As Ars previously reported, OpenAI struck more than $1.4 trillion in infrastructure deals in 2025 and expects to burn roughly $9 billion this year while generating about $13 billion in revenue. Only about 5 percent of ChatGPT’s 800 million weekly users pay for subscriptions. Anthropic is also not yet profitable, but it relies on enterprise contracts and paid subscriptions rather than advertising, and it has not taken on infrastructure commitments at the same scale as OpenAI.

Competition between Anthropic and OpenAI is especially testy because several OpenAI employees left the company to found Anthropic in 2021. Currently, Anthropic’s Claude Code has pulled off something of a market upset, becoming a favorite among some software developers despite the company’s much smaller overall market share among chatbot users.

Altman opened his lengthy post on X by granting that the ads were “funny” and that he “laughed.” But then the tone shifted. “I wonder why Anthropic would go for something so clearly dishonest,” he wrote. “We would obviously never run ads in the way Anthropic depicts them. We are not stupid and we know our users would reject that.”

He went further: “I guess it’s on brand for Anthropic doublespeak to use a deceptive ad to critique theoretical deceptive ads that aren’t real, but a Super Bowl ad is not where I would expect it.”

Altman framed the dispute as a fight over access. “More Texans use ChatGPT for free than total people use Claude in the US, so we have a differently shaped problem than they do,” he wrote. He then accused Anthropic of overreach: “Anthropic wants to control what people do with AI,” adding that Anthropic blocks “companies they don’t like from using their coding product (including us).” He closed with: “One authoritarian company won’t get us there on their own, to say nothing of the other obvious risks. It is a dark path.”

OpenAI CMO Kate Rouch posted a response, calling the ads “funny” before pivoting. “Anthropic thinks powerful AI should be tightly controlled in small rooms in San Francisco and Davos,” she wrote. “That it’s too DANGEROUS for you.”

Anthropic’s post declaring Claude ad-free does hedge a bit, however. “Should we need to revisit this approach, we’ll be transparent about our reasons for doing so,” Anthropic wrote.

OpenAI President Greg Brockman pointed this out on X, asking Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei directly whether he would “commit to never selling Claude’s ‘users’ attention or data to advertisers,’” calling it a “genuine question” and noting that Anthropic’s blog post “makes it sound like you’re keeping the option open.”</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Back in 2022, astronomers were puzzled by a so-called “tidal disruption event” (TDE), dubbed AT2018hyz, that had faded when it was first noticed three years earlier, only to unexpectedly reanimate and burp out extremely bright radio waves. University of Oregon astrophysicist Yvette Cendes, a co-author of that 2022 paper, dubbed the black hole “Jetty McJetface” (a nod to the 2016 online British competition to name a research vessel Boaty McBoatface).

Astronomers have continued to monitor it ever since. Far from fading again, the TDE has grown 50 times brighter, and that brightness continues to increase. The black hole’s energy emission might not peak until 2027, according to a new paper published in the Astrophysical Journal.

As we’ve previously discussed, it’s a popular misconception that black holes behave like cosmic vacuum cleaners, ravenously sucking up any matter in their surroundings. In reality, only stuff that passes beyond the event horizon—including light—is swallowed up and can’t escape, although black holes are also messy eaters. That means that part of an object’s matter is actually ejected out in a powerful jet.

In a TDE, a star is shredded (or “spaghettified”) by the powerful gravitational forces of a black hole outside the event horizon, and part of the star’s original mass is ejected violently outward. This, in turn, can form a rotating ring of matter (aka an accretion disk) around the black hole that emits powerful X-rays and visible light. The jets are one way astronomers can indirectly infer the presence of a black hole. Those outflow emissions typically occur soon after the TDE.

When AT2018hyz, aka “Jetty,” was first discovered, radio telescopes didn’t detect any signatures of an outflow emission of material within the first few months. According to Cendes, that’s true of some 80 percent of TDEs, so astronomers moved on, preferring to use precious telescope time for more potentially interesting objects. A few years later, radio data from the Very Large Array (VLA) showed that Jetty was lighting up the skies again, spewing out material at a whopping 1.4 millijansky at 5 GHz.

Since then, that brightness has kept increasing. Just how large is the increase? Well, people have estimated the fictional Death Star’s emitted energy in the Star Wars saga, and Jetty McJetface’s emissions are a trillion times more than that, perhaps as much as 100 trillion times the energy. As for why Jetty initially eluded detection, there seems to be a single jet emitting radiation in one direction that might not have been aimed at Earth. Astronomers should be able to confirm this once the energy peaks.

Cendes and her team are now scouring the skies for similar behavior in high-energy TDEs, since the existence of Jetty suggests that delayed outflow is more common than astronomers previously expected. It’s such an unprecedented phenomenon that astronomers haven’t really looked for them before. After all, “If you have an explosion, why would you expect there to be something years after the explosion happened when you didn’t see something before?” said Cendes.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">When a group of crypto bros spent $300,000 commissioning a 15-foot gold statue of Donald Trump, their grift seemed solid enough. Their memecoin, $PATRIOT — for which the Trump sculpture served as a sort of promotional stunt — would soon go to the Moon, covering the costs of the piece and then some.

Shockingly, the exact opposite happened. Despite securing a “juicy, juicy spot” for the statue at the president’s resort, Trump National Doral Miami, $PATRIOT crashed to the ground. Today, the memecoin — which boasted a market cap as high as $77.7 million around Trump’s return to office in January of 2025 — now stands at just $2.8 million, while the toweringeffigy gathers dust in Ohio.

Now, fresh reporting by the New York Times documents the wild ride that turned a group of crypto goons into a national laughing stock.

For a very brief moment prior to Trump’s second inauguration, the coin surged, sustaining millions of dollars in daily trading volume in anticipation of the president’s promise to turn the country into the “crypto capital of the planet.” The backers, a motley crew of libertarian crypto developers and MAGA faithful, successfully drummed up social media frenzy, even gaining approval from former Trump aide Steve Bannon.

Then reality arrived, as it always does seems to when memecoins are involved. Infighting erupted as the token cratered, driven down by the release of Trump’s own scammy memecoin, $TRUMP. The sculptor contracted to build the statue, Alan Cottrill, soon called in a $90,000 debt the crypto bros owed for using his work to market their digital currency.

“You are using my copyrighted image in marketing your token!” Cottrill exclaimed to the contract-holders in a text message viewed by the NYT.

“Yes lol as we planned to from day 1,” rejoined Ashley Sansalone, one of the crypto developers involved.

Until the group pays the final $90,000, Cottrill says he’s under no obligation to release the statue.

“As far as I’m concerned, they haven’t bought the rights to the IP, and they’re using it illegally,” the sculptor told the NYT. “That statue will not leave my foundry until everything they owe me is paid.”

            <h2>Tesla Stock Plummeting Since Musk Busted in Epstein Files</h2>
            <p><strong>Futurism | 2026-02-05</strong></p>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Late last month, new “Epstein files” from the Department of Justice revealed that Tesla CEO Elon Musk was in regular correspondence with deceased sex criminal Jeffrey Epstein, going as far as to invite himself to his notorious Caribbean island, asking when the “wildest party” would take place in a 2012 email.

It was a damning contradiction of Musk’s previous claims that he’d “refused” Epstein’s offer, and they seemed to throw the billionaire into a tailspin.

Perhaps unsurprisingly, Tesla’s shares have been plummeting since the DOJ’s release. Shares are down almost eight percent over the last five days since the emails were released.

It’s the very last thing Tesla needs right now. The company’s brand has already suffered greatly under Musk’s leadership, with droves of potential buyers being pushed away by his inflammatory rhetoric and embrace of far-right ideals.

The company’s core business has also been floundering as of late, with Musk announcing that it’s ending production of its Model S and X vehicles, while turning the factory that used to make them into a robot assembly line. The move was part of a much broader shift away from selling cars and towards the company’s humanoid robots and AI ambitions.

While Tesla’s valuation remains massively inflated — it’s still worth well over $1.5 trillion — the company’s financials tell an ominous story. Tesla reported its first-ever decline in annual revenue for 2025, with sales slumping across three of the past four quarters. It also saw a whopping 61 percent drop in profits in Q4 of last year, compared to the same period the year before.

The competition is making major headway as well, with German automaker Volkswagen officially overtaking Tesla in fully-electric car sales in Europe last year, according to the latest data. Chinese rival BYD is also handily outselling Tesla these days, making major gains across Europe and becoming the world’s top EV seller.

In other words, Musk’s carmaker’s first-mover advantage has long dried up.

By all indications, it feels like Tesla has come to accept its fate. The company hasn’t launched a fully new model since its Cybertruck in late 2023, which turned out to be a massive flop.

“A big driver for the decline is lack of new products,” Cox Automotive director of industry insights Stephanie Valdez Streaty told Bloomberg. “Any automaker that doesn’t have new products is going to lose market share. Tesla needs new products.”

Infamously lacking customer service and extensive quality control issues are also signs of a company that has long lost its place as an early pioneer in the EV space.

Adding to the company’s woes is Musk’s SpaceX acquiring his own AI startup xAI, turning his space company into a $1.25 trillion behemoth and sparking rumors that Tesla may eventually be folded in as well.

The merger may also be indicative of Musk turning his attention elsewhere. As CNBC points out, he now derives more of his enormous net worth from SpaceX than from Tesla, a symbolic turning point as he seemingly grows tired of pretending to care about EV sales. (Musk has promised that Optimus will account for80 percent of the carmaker’s value.)

The mercurial entrepreneur’s appearance in the Epstein files once again underlines the carmaker’s continuous struggles to control the narrative and rein in the drama.

If the company’s history is anything to go by, there’s certainly a chance the company, which remains one of the most valuable by market cap in the world, will weather the storm. But this time, we’re not talking about scaling up production of the Model 3, a major source of suffering for the CEO almost a decade ago — instead, the company is looking to reinvent itself from scratch.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">At this point, there’s nothing left to say about Elon Musk that hasn’t been said a thousand times already. Yet his latest comment is so on the nose, we couldn’t resist.

“Whoever said ‘money can’t buy happiness’ really know what they were talking about,” the world’s richest man mourned on X-formerly-Twitter this week, likely from one of his mansions, or perhaps his private jet.

It’s a pathetic complaint from someone who could end homelessness in multiple cities, fund universal school lunch programs across the US, or bankroll malaria eradication with just a fraction of his wealth.

It also comes just days after another tranche of emails from notorious pedophile Jeffrey Epstein were released to the public. There, it was revealed that Musk had been in extensive contact with Epstein in the years following his 2008 conviction for soliciting prostitution from a minor. (Musk even went so far as to beg Epstein for an invite to his infamous island in December of 2013, contradicting his earlier assurance that he’d “refused” the offer.)

The revelation is evidently taking its toll on Musk, who began a desperate campaign to clear his name on social media. “If I actually wanted to spend my time partying with young women, it would be trivial for me to do so without the help of a creepy loser like Epstein,” the billionaire raved in one post.

Now that his ties to Epstein are undeniable, Musk evidently thinks he can pity-post his way out of it. So here’s a challenge, Elon: if money really doesn’t buy happiness, set yourself free. Liquidate your hundreds of billions and feed the hungry, house the homeless, and fund the schools.

He won’t, of course — but he could, and that’s what makes this performance so insulting. At least King Midas had the decency to regret his curse.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">For over a millennium, measles have ravaged humanity. Physicians as far back as 10th century Persia have been documenting the virus, which killed millions of children well into the 20th century. Finally, in 1963, biochemist John Enders developed the first measles vaccine, a development which virtually eradicated the virus from the US population by the year 2000.

That was then. Now the virus is back, threatening to tear through a Texas immigration detention center with a vengeance — a grim collision of Trump-era vaccine skepticism and brutal immigration enforcement that seems to perfectly encapsulate this moment in US politics.

That’s right: according to the Washington Post, two detainees at the federal immigration family detention center in Dilley, Texas have tested positive for measles.

Both cases were confirmed by the Texas Department of State Health Services on Saturday. In a statement to WaPo, the Department of Homeland Security said officers had quarantined anyone who made contact with the two individuals, and “took steps to limit movement” for everybody else.

“Medical staff is continuing to monitor the detainees’ conditions and will take appropriate and active steps to prevent further infection,” DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin told the newspaper in a statement. “All detainees are being provided with proper medical care.”

Eric Lee, an immigration attorney providing counsel to a family at the facility, told WaPo that detainees were being left in the dark. Not only have DHS personnel not mentioned the positive cases, Lee explained, but they haven’t even started looking into the detainees’ vaccination status.

“They’re not being told anything, and they are not being offered any sort of protective measures,” Lee said of those being forcibly held inside. “And it’s important to point out that this is not just a detention conditions issue — it’s a public health issue generally.”

The attorney was present at the detention facility back in January, when guards abruptly ordered attorneys out following a peaceful protest staged by people in detention.

In an interview with Texas Public Radio after the fact, Lee described the detention camp as a “horrible, horrible place.” The water is “putrid” and undrinkable, he said, and detainees are served meals containing “bugs” and other debris.

“This is not a place that you would want to have your child be for even 15 minutes,” he said.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">In 2024, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman dismissed the possibility that his company would ever have to stuff ads into its chatbots, painting it as a desperate move he called a “last resort for us as a business model.”

As it turns out, the billionaire may have overestimated how much people were willing to shell out every month to access ChatGPT. Paid subscriber growth has slowed in key markets as OpenAI continues to burn billions of dollars every quarter, further stoking concerns over the company’s potential inability to turn things around before it’s too late.

And as the competition at Anthropic and Google continued to make massive strides in their efforts to catch up, Altman declared an internal “code red,” announcing late last year that ChatGPT was getting ads after all.

OpenAI’s competitors saw the reversal as a golden opportunity to strike. Anthropic released a series of Super Bowl ads this week that openly skewer Altman’s compromise on ads — without ever naming the company outright, cleverly — in a bid to strike a chord with users who aren’t thrilled about an ad-packed chatbot experience.

“Ads are coming to AI.” the ads’ tagline reads. “But not to Claude.”

It’s always a bad sign when someone insists that they’re not mad and actually laughing. So when Altman declared on X that he thinks the ads are “funny” and that he “laughed” — before posting a lengthy screed about how they’re horribly unfair — it was an unintentional masterclass in corporate insecurity.

“But I wonder why Anthropic would go for something so clearly dishonest,” he wrote. “Our most important principle for ads says that we won’t do exactly this; we would obviously never run ads in the way Anthropic depicts them.”

Altman also angrily accused the company of “doublespeak” and using a “deceptive ad to critique theoretical deceptive ads that aren’t real.”

The CEO also called users who shell out $20 a month for a Claude subscription “rich people” — a bizarre characterization, especially given his multibillion-dollar net worth.

“We are glad they do that and we are doing that too, but we also feel strongly that we need to bring AI to billions of people who can’t pay for subscriptions,” Altman wrote.

He also accused Anthropic of trying to become an “authoritarian company” that wants to “control what people do with AI,” even though there’s plenty of evidence to suggest that he’s the pot calling the kettle black.

It’s a messy and unusually public blowout that highlights how the AI race, once fought in board rooms behind closed doors and through carefully worded press releases, is entering the public consciousness.

Altman’s frustration perfectly illustrates how AI companies have driven themselves into a corner. Either they can charge a hefty monthly fee to cut their losses and reassure spooked investors that they can, in fact, deliver revenues on their balance sheets — or scare away users through annoying ads, like every generation of new platform before them.

While OpenAI hasn’t yet settled on a way to implement ads for its blockbuster chatbot, an early screenshot the company showed off during its announcement late last year indicates that free-tier users will likely be painfully aware that the company is trying to sell them something. The shown example ad covers a significant chunk — almost half — of the mobile screen.

It remains to be seen how users will react once the ads go live. Will they immediately flock to an ad-free competitor, like Claude or Google’s Gemini, or will they be willing to stick it out to avoid paying more than what they pay for Netflix every month?

The AI race is bound to drag on as companies like OpenAI will continue to desperately convince their customers and investors that their existence — and enormous spending — is justified and that their tech is worth the hassle in the first place. Given the recent tech selloffs and nervousness among investors and diminishing performance gains with each new AI model release, that seems to still be an open question.

In short, Altman may say he was amused by Anthropic’s latest slight, but given his heated rhetoric, the gloves are starting to come off.

“‘I laughed, until I didn’t.&#39;” one Reddit user joked.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">During the COVID-19 pandemic, stationary bike company Peloton was the talk of the town, allowing its customers to stay fit from the comfort of their own homes.

But once people started reemerging into the world to once again hit the gym and ride their bikes outdoors, the company began to struggle, a tailspin that has been ongoing ever since. The company’s stock dropped by almost 30 percent in 2025 alone, while over 100,000 subscribers decided to part ways.

In an unsurprising move, Peloton announced a flashy pivot to AI last year to drum up some much-needed enthusiasm amid the slump. (The company also used the new tech injection to justify a considerable price hike for subscribers.)

A new slew of AI equipment, featuring cameras that watch your every move, was somehow even more expensive than their already considerably pricy lineup of exercise equipment. Sales were off to a rough start towards the end of last year, indicating consumers weren’t flocking to stores to buy a stationary bike with an AI-enabled camera.

And shockingly, the company’s doubling down on AI doesn’t appear to have paid off. As Bloomberg reports, the company slashed 11 percent of its workforce this week as part of an existing effort to save $100 million. The goal is to optimize spending by “reshaping our teams and, in some cases, the locations where we work,” a spokesperson told the outlet.

It’s the latest sign that companies’ enormous investments in AI are simply nowhere near paying dividends. While many companies have argued that AI can do the jobs of those who’ve been caught up in layoffs, we have yet to see any compelling evidence for that conclusion, suggesting it’s more an excuse for implementing austerity measures than true AI automation. Case in point, a study published by researchers at MIT last year found that a staggering 95 percent of attempts to incorporate generative AI into business so far are failing to generate “rapid revenue acceleration.”

And it’s not just Peloton laying off employees. Other companies, including Amazon, Meta, and Pinterest — all of which have made major investments in AI — have recently announced plans to cut significant chunks of their workforce, indicating even more troubling days ahead.

Whether implementing major price hikes and offering more expensive hardware will buoy up any much-needed investor excitement for Peloton remains unclear at best. According to Bloomberg, analysts are already antsy about increasing prices scaring away customers, particularly as the cost of living continues to rise.

Meanwhile, Peloton users have long felt like they’re not being valued by the company, which has consistently doubled down on pushing equipment sales and raising prices.

“They built for the pandemic surge and then acted like it was never going to end,” one Reddit user wrote in response to the latest news. “The product still works, and the instructors are still the draw. The issue is they keep behaving like a hardware company instead of what they actually are, which is a subscription and content platform.”

“They should stop chasing hardware volume and casual users and double down on the people who actually use the platform!” the user added. “Power users are the base.”

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">On Monday, OpenAI launched Codex, an agentic coding tool marketed to software developers. Today, OpenAI also launched a new model designed to turbo-charge Codex: GPT-5.3 Codex.

The company says that the model transforms Codex from an agent that can merely “write and review code” to one that can do “nearly anything developers and professionals do on a computer, expanding who can build software and how work gets done.” Having tested its new model against a number of performance benchmarks, OpenAI claims that it can create “highly functional complex games and apps from scratch over the course of days.”

OpenAI says that GPT-5.3 Codex is also 25 percent faster than its previous model (GPT-5.2) and that it was the company’s first model that “was instrumental in creating itself,” meaning that the company’s staff used early versions of the program to debug itself and evaluate how it was performing.

The new model release notably follows hot on the heels of a new agentic coding model released by its competitor, Anthropic. Indeed, OpenAI and Anthropic had originally planned to release their two agentic coding tools at the exact same time: 10 a.m. PST. However, not long before the original release time, Anthropic moved its release date up by 15 minutes, slightly besting OpenAI in the race to publicize the models.

            <h2>One of Europe’s largest universities knocked offline for days after cyberattack</h2>
            <p><strong>TechCrunch | 2026-02-05</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/05/one-of-europes-largest-universities-knocked-offline-for-days-after-cyberattack/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The computer systems of La Sapienza in Rome, one of the largest universities in Europe with around 120,000 students, have been down for three days following an apparent ransomware attack.

In a post and stories on Instagram published Tuesday, the university said that it took down its systems out of precaution following the cyberattack, that it was investigating the incident and working on restoring all digital services, and that some communication channels such as email and workstations are “partially limited.”

The school also said that it was working to restore systems based on backups, which were not affected by the hack.

As of this writing the Sapienza website remains down.

Italian daily news outlet Il Corriere della Sera reported this week that the disruption is due to a ransomware attack, something that the school nor other authorities have confirmed so far. The hackers allegedly sent the university a link to a request for a ransom, which has a countdown of 72 hours, which would start only once the link is clicked.

La Sapieza did not respond to TechCrunch’s request for comment sent via email. It’s unclear if the university is able to accept email at the time we reached out.

Spokespeople for Italy’s national cybersecurity agency, Agenzia per la Cybersicurezza Nazionale (or ACN), which is investigating the incident, did not immediately respond to a request for comment, asking for more information and if the attack was caused by ransomware.

In another article on Wednesday, Il Corriere reported that the hacking group behind the attack is called “Femwar02,” which was previously unknown prior to this incident. The gang used the BabLock malware, which was discovered in 2023 and is also known as Rorschach, according to the report.

La Sapienza said that exams are proceeding as normal, but students who want to sign up for exams must do so directly with professors. The school also set up “infopoints” on several locations on campus to provide information to students.

Like other types of organizations, universities and schools are frequent targets of hackers. Last year, the notorious hacking group ShinyHunters hacked Harvard University and University of Pennsylvania and stole data — without using malware to encrypt its systems — in an effort to extort the schools. The hackers revealed this week that the schools did not pay the ransom.

            <h2>Elon Musk is getting serious about orbital data centers</h2>
            <p><strong>TechCrunch | 2026-02-05</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/05/elon-musk-is-getting-serious-about-orbital-data-centers/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">On Friday, when SpaceX filed plans with the FCC for a million-satellite data center network, you might have thought Elon Musk was having a bit of fun with us. But a week later, it is clear that he is dead serious.

The most obvious step, of course, is the formal merger between SpaceX and xAI that went forward on Monday, officially drawing together Musk’s space and AI ventures in a way that makes a lot more sense if there’s some kind of joint infrastructure project planned.

But even beyond the merger, we’re starting to see the idea of orbital AI data clusters — essentially, networks of computers operating in space — cohere into an actual plan. On Wednesday, the FCC accepted the filing and set a schedule seeking public comment. It’s a pro forma step normally, but FCC chairman Brendan Carr took the unusual step of sharing the filing on X. Throughout his tenure as chairman, Carr has shown himself eager to help Trump’s friends and punish his enemies — so as long as Musk stays on Trump’s good side, the proposal is likely to sail through without issue.

At the same time, Elon Musk has started to flesh out the argument for orbital data centers in public. On a new episode of Stripe co-founder Patrick Collison’s podcast “Cheeky Pint,” which also featured guest Dwarkesh Patel, Musk laid out the basic case for moving most of our AI computing power into space. Essentially, solar panels produce more power in space, so you can cut down on one of the main operating expenses for data centers.

“It’s harder to scale on the ground than it is to scale in space,” Musk said in the podcast. “Any given solar panel is going to give you about five times more power in space than on the ground, so it’s actually much cheaper to do in space.”

Close listeners will note that there is a bit of a gap in the logic here! It’s true that solar panels produce more power in space, but since power isn’t the only cost in operating a data center and solar panels aren’t the only way to power a data center, it doesn’t follow that it’s cheaper to do the whole thing in orbit, as Patel noted in the podcast. Patel also raised concerns about servicing GPUs that fail during AI model training, but you’ll have to listen to the full episode for that.

Overall, Musk was undeterred, marking 2028 as a tipping point year for orbital data centers. “You can mark my words, in 36 months but probably closer to 30 months, the most economically compelling place to put AI will be space,” Musk said.

He didn’t stop there. “Five years from now, my prediction is we will launch and be operating every year more AI in space than the cumulative total on Earth,” Musk continued.

For context, as of 2030, global data center capacity will be an estimated 200 GW, which is roughly a trillion dollars’ worth of infrastructure when you’re just putting it on the ground.

Of course, SpaceX makes its money by launching things into orbit, so all this is pretty convenient for Musk — particularly now that SpaceX has an AI company attached to it. And with the new SpaceX-xAI conglomerate headed for an IPO in just a few months, you can expect to hear a lot more about orbital data centers in the months ahead. With tech companies still pouring hundreds of billions of dollars into data center spending each year, there’s a real chance that not all the money will remain earthbound.

            <div id="article-text">Get ready for some selfies that are out of this world. NASA astronauts will be allowed to bring their smartphones to space for the first time, starting with the Crew-12 and Artemis II missions.

Crew-12 is expected to head to the International Space Station next week, while the highly anticipated Artemis II mission — which will bring humans around the moon for the first time since the 1960s — was delayed until March.

“We are giving our crews the tools to capture special moments for their families and share inspiring images and video with the world,” NASA administrator Jared Isaacman wrote on X.

With the newest iPhones and Android devices at hand, the crew will be able to be a bit more spontaneous with image and video gathering, meaning that for those of us back home, these upcoming trips to space could end up being some of NASA’s most well-documented journeys yet.

Imagine how cool (or cringe-worthy) it will be if astronauts turn themselves into TikTok stars in zero gravity, or if they take ultra-wide-angle selfies in the spacecraft. For those working in government bureaucracy, it’s equally exciting, apparently, that NASA approved this rule change pretty quickly.

“Just as important, we challenged long-standing processes and qualified modern hardware for spaceflight on an expedited timeline,” Isaacman wrote. “That operational urgency will serve NASA well as we pursue the highest-value science and research in orbit and on the lunar surface.”

It makes sense that it would be hard to approve new technology to go into space — if one small thing goes astray, a spaceflight can go terribly wrong. Until now, the newest cameras that were supposed to go on these missions were decade-old Nikon DSLRs and GoPros, according to Ars Technica. That’s by no means arcane, but there’s something more spontaneous and whimsical about using a smartphone.

This is not, however, the first time that smartphones have gone to space. SpaceX allowed smartphones for its private astronaut missions.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">OpenAI has launched a new product to help enterprises navigate the world of AI agents, focusing on agent management as critical infrastructure for enterprise AI adoption.

On Thursday, AI giant OpenAI announced the launch of OpenAI Frontier, an end-to-end platform designed for enterprises to build and manage AI agents. It’s an open platform, which means users can manage agents built outside of OpenAI too.

Frontier users can program AI agents to connect to external data and applications, which allows them to execute tasks far outside of the OpenAI platform. Users can also limit and manage what these agents have access to, and what they can do, of course.

OpenAI said Frontier was designed to work the same way companies manage human employees. Frontier offers an onboarding process for agents and a feedback loop that is meant to help them improve over time the same way a review might help an employee.

OpenAI touted enterprises, including HP, Oracle, State Farm, and Uber as customers, but Frontier is currently only available to a limited number of users with plans to roll out more generally in the coming months.

The company would not disclose pricing details in a press briefing earlier this week, according to reporting from The Verge. OpenAI declined to comment on pricing.

Agent-management products become table stakes since AI agents rose to prominence in 2024. Salesforce has arguably the best-known such product, Agentforce, which the company launched in the fall of 2024. Others have quickly followed. LangChain is a notable player in the space that was founded in 2022 and has raised more than $150 million in venture capital. CrewAI is a smaller upstart that has raised more than $20 million in venture capital.

In December, global research and advisory firm Gartner released a report about this type of software and called agent management platforms both the “most valuable real estate in AI” and a necessary piece of infrastructure for enterprises to adopt AI.

It’s not surprising that OpenAI would release this platform in early 2026, as the company has made it clear that enterprise adoption is one of its main focus areas for this year. The company has also announced two notable enterprise deals this year with ServiceNow and Snowflake.

Still, if OpenAI wants to be a meaningful player in the enterprise space, offering a product like Frontier is a promising step.

            <h2>Anthropic releases Opus 4.6 with new ‘agent teams’</h2>
            <p><strong>TechCrunch | 2026-02-05</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/05/anthropic-releases-opus-4-6-with-new-agent-teams/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">On Thursday, Anthropic released the latest version of Opus — its most advanced model and a particularly important model for Claude Code. Opus 4.5 was only released last November, and with 4.6, the company has sought to broaden its model’s capabilities and appeal, allowing for a greater variety of uses and customers.

Perhaps the most notable addition to the newest version of Opus is the inclusion of what the company calls “agent teams” — teams of agents that can split larger tasks into segmented jobs.

“Instead of one agent working through tasks sequentially, you can split the work across multiple agents — each owning its piece and coordinating directly with the others,” the company says. Scott White, Head of Product at Anthropic, compared the new feature to having a talented team of humans working for you, noting that the segmenting of agent responsibilities allows them “to coordinate in parallel [and work] faster.” The agent teams are currently available in a research preview for API users and subscribers.

Opus 4.6 also comes with a longer context window — meaning that the program has a capacity to recall a greater amount of information per user session. The new model offers 1 million tokens of context, which is comparable to what the company’s Sonnet (versions 4 and 4.5) currently offers. Those context windows allow for work involving larger code bases and can also allow for the processing of larger documents, the company says.

The new version of Opus also integrates Claude directly into PowerPoint as an accessible side panel. This is a step up from PowerPoint’s previous integration with the chatbot. Previously, a user could tell Claude to create a PowerPoint deck, but the file would then have to be transferred to PowerPoint to edit the presentation, White said. Now the presentation can be crafted within PowerPoint, with direct help from Claude.

White told TechCrunch that Opus has evolved from a model that was highly capable in one particular domain — software development — into a program that could be “really useful for a broader set” of knowledge workers. “We noticed a lot of people who are not professional software developers using Claude Code simply because it was a really amazing engine to do tasks,” he said. White added that the kinds of people the company has seen using it include not just software engineers, but product managers, financial analysts, and people from a variety of other industries.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Remember the Yang Gang? The bros in MATH baseball hats behind Andrew Yang’s dark-horse presidential candidacy back in 2019? Yang ran on the “freedom dividend”—his proposal for a universal basic income of $1,000 a month for every American. Many wrote him off as a futuristic Chicken Little because of his predictions of mass job loss driven by automation and AI. That part of his message, at least, is now mainstream. According to a recent MIT study, nearly 12 percent of tasks in the American labor market—representing $1.2 trillion in wages—could be performed by AI today. A Senate committee report released in October warns that America could lose nearly 100 million jobs to AI and automation within the next decade. The technology is transforming work faster than the government, companies, and employees can respond.

But few people, and even fewer politicians, seem to be talking about UBI. Maybe there are better solutions, more effective policies—but no one is talking much about them, either. Did Yang come a few years too early—or did he just have the wrong idea?

Yang was a political outsider who had never run in an election before, yet with his UBI platform and bro-friendly delivery, he earned a spot in the presidential debates. He ended up suspending his campaign the night of the New Hampshire primary—he has joked that people dismissed him as “the magical Asian man from the future” who “wants to give everyone money.” But his goal was never to win, he told me in his office in December. “My design was to raise the alarm around AI and mainstream universal basic income.”

People stop him, Yang told me, “on the street, every day” to say: “You were right on AI, and we need universal basic income.” Or they tell him, “You were right. Run again.”

Read: Andrew Yang doesn’t have any litmus test

His new book, out this month—Hey Yang, Where’s My Thousand Bucks?—answers the question of what he’s been up to in the past few years, with self-deprecating humor. “The alternative title,” Yang said, had been: Hey, Am I Racist, or Are You Andrew Yang?

He sees himself as different from other politicians, for the simple fact that he’s a man who recognizes a problem and comes up with an idea to fix it. The trouble was that neither the man nor the idea were politically viable. As a politician, he didn’t capture enough voters’ trust or imagination. The other candidates might not have been offering much, but their stump speeches were familiar. UBI was solving a problem voters didn’t yet know they had.

Looking back, you might say that at least he proposed we do something … about anything. The “disease in American politics that is pushing us all into the mud is that you do not actually have to solve the problem,” Yang told me. Politicians are playing “you lose, I lose,” in which the parties take turns screwing up and returning to power. Meanwhile, “you have AI coming to eat tens of millions of jobs. And you don’t have a meaningful conversation about it.”

Since 2019, when Stockton, California, launched a basic-income pilot, more than 72 local governments in 26 states have experimented with such programs, according to a report published last year by a coalition of politicians who support UBI. The report found that the recipients experienced an increase in health and financial stability and a reduction in stress, without any decrease in employment. In some places, a significant portion of participants ended up working more during the pilot. (Other experiments have not proved to be as effective.)

UBI would, of course, be hugely expensive. But the bigger issue is that it’s politically unpopular, Robert Greenstein, the founder of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a think tank that focuses on low- and moderate-income people, told me. “No disrespect to Andrew Yang or UBI proponents. I’ve always admired their dedication,” Greenstein said, before adding the inevitable but: “They didn’t pay sufficient attention to history.”

Americans are much more supportive of in-kind benefits, such as SNAP, than they are of cash assistance. Even benefits such as unemployment insurance have become harder to qualify for in the past half century. UBI hasn’t even gotten “to first base politically,” Greenstein said, because “we have one party that doesn’t want to raise taxes on anybody” and “the other party doesn’t want to raise taxes on anybody with incomes below $400,000 a year.”

Yang wouldn’t argue with that. Politicians, he said, are afraid of alienating donors in Big Tech, even though some tech CEOs such as Dario Amodei of Anthropic have said themselves that the government should tax them more.

Yang says that Republicans tend to hate UBI because it’s a huge entitlement program and they don’t like the idea of what he describes as a “capitalism where income doesn’t start at zero.” (But he does point out that Donald Trump, whom “I disagree with on just about every front, actually senses that that money is good in people’s hands,” which is why the president sent out baby bonds and proposed tariff-rebate checks.)

But Yang sees Democrats as even worse. “If you were to say to Democrats, ‘Hey, let’s say we tax the AI companies. Maybe we should give that money to people, families, displaced workers,’ a lot of Democrats would be like, ‘No, no, no. It would be much better if we put that money to schools.’” He describes Democrats as the last of the institutionalists, sinking money into programs and systems without ever questioning how well they are working. They don’t have to bother trying to think differently, because when voters tire of Republicans, they have no choice but to come running back to Democrats.

Yang, being Yang, has another solution for that.

Yang is loquacious, tall, affable, and very smart. And did I say “loquacious”? But he is no politician, despite having run for president and, in 2021, New York City mayor. (He was the Democratic front-runner for most of the primary race, before finishing in fourth place.) He doesn’t glad-hand or try to “make you feel seen.” Instead, he just talks—assuredly, and with data. Spending time with him feels like being seated next to your friend’s chatty husband at a dinner party. When the dinner’s over, you are happy for your friend—and relieved for yourself.

Our meeting in December wasn’t the first time I had spoken with Yang. A couple of years ago, I was an unpaid speaker at a small conference that he started, called the Hudson Valley Ideas Festival. Yang is always starting something. Businesses, nonprofits, political parties.

After graduating from Columbia Law School, Yang worked briefly at a corporate-law firm, then for a failed start-up, then in a tech job, before he worked for and eventually became the CEO of Manhattan Prep, a tutoring company. Pumping high-achieving students into the graduate-school-to-white-collar pipeline made Yang question a system that concentrates the best and brightest in a handful of cities and professions. So he began Venture for America, a nonprofit that recruited graduates to work at start-ups in B- and C-list American cities and then trained them to create start-ups of their own.

Yang raised millions of dollars for the organization and was praised by the Obama administration. But according to The New York Times, Venture largely failed to deliver. A decade into the program, only about a dozen of the start-ups were still in business in the targeted cities, employing about 150 people. “Andrew comes up with these grand ideas, and he loves to obsess about them and talk about how great they are, but he doesn’t think through all the details,” Cris Landa, a former Venture for America employee, told the Times.

By 2017, when Yang left Venture for America to run for president, the “grand idea” he was obsessing over was UBI. By his own benchmark, his campaign could be considered a success. He got people talking about a future in which a million truck drivers would likely be unemployed. Yet it left him “despondent.”

Yang could see that his message wasn’t connecting with enough voters. He would give his stump speech about labor-market trends and a fourth Industrial Revolution, but even if people found it interesting, it couldn’t compete with Democrats’ traditional applause lines about unions and women’s rights. He told me that he had tried to talk about job-loss numbers that “in theory describe some objective reality, which in theory matters,” but all that people really wanted was for his message to be “crammed into a tribal language” that could be summed up as: “Trump bad.”

“I could have said any number,” Yang told me, and it wouldn’t have mattered. “I got the sinking feeling coming off the trail, like, Oh, no. We’re actually even further away from solving this problem.”

The campaign was clearly a failure, but Yang took it as encouragement to try to remake the entire political system. He joined the board of FairVote, an organization that champions ranked-choice voting. In 2021, he left the Democratic Party and co-founded, with Christine Todd Whitman and Michael S. Willner, a new party: Forward, which describes itself as a solutions-driven alternative to Democrats and Republicans. According to its website, 71 elected officials, including mayors and congresspeople, are affiliated with the party. But if you haven’t yet heard of Forward, Yang has a theory that explains why.

In 2020, Yang was hired as a commentator for CNN. He claims that he was given an option to renew in 2021, but the offer was rescinded after he became an independent. In his telling, though 45 percent of Americans identify as independents, network executives stopped thinking that he had any value once he wasn’t part of the bipartisan political system. (In a comment to Fox News Digital, CNN said that the decision was based on the conflict of interest that would arise from Yang’s “intention to launch and serve as the leader of a political party.”) He was, however, inundated with requests to appear on Fox News. “They kept saying to me, ‘Hey, Andrew, you left the Democratic Party. Like, why did they suck so bad?’ I was like, ‘I don’t think Republicans are the answer. I think the entire system needs reform.’”

In 2024, Yang endorsed Democratic Representative Dean Phillips of Minnesota for president. Phillips considered President Biden’s advanced age and his lack of popularity, and broke ranks to primary him. Democrats, Yang said, responded by saying, “We’re going to malign this guy, destroy his reputation,” because “how dare he try and cut the line and run for president when he’s, like, No. 54 in our pecking order?” Yang called it an “institutional shivving.” He was even more outraged by the lengthy postmortem on the election that the Democratic National Committee eventually decided against releasing.

“I’ve got five words for their postmortem,” Yang said. “Should’ve. Held. A. Fucking. Primary.”

When Yang gets stopped on the street by people asking what he’s been up to, many times he’s in New York City’s Garment District, where the office of his new cellular-service company, Noble Mobile, is located.

Yang launched the company in September after raising more than $10 million, and he said it now has thousands of subscribers. When I visited, the elevators of the nondescript building were plastered with flyers inviting other residents to the company’s upcoming holiday party.

“The average American is sad for two reasons,” Yang said. “More, but let’s just stick with two: No. 1, they’re not able to save enough money on a monthly basis. And No. 2, they’re spending too much time staring at what Hasan Minhaj calls ‘their rectangle of sadness.’”

From the May 2021 issue: What if Andrew Yang wins?

Powered by T-Mobile’s network, Noble Mobile’s service is relatively cheap—closer to what Europeans pay each month. Yang’s goal, he said, was to do with mobile plans what his friend Mark Cuban did with Cost Plus Drugs and prescription medications. In addition, the company encourages customers to limit their doomscrolling—“which, by the way, is also a polarizing force”—by giving them up to a $20 credit every month that they don’t use all of their data. According to Yang, the rebate pushes the average user’s phone time down 17 percent by their second month on the service. Last year, the company threw a series of no-phones parties across the country, with dance floors, themed cocktails, and a few inches of lawn—touch grass read a sign. (Yang was a party promoter in his 20s; the instinct clearly hasn’t left him.)

Yang describes the company as a logical outgrowth of his political work, including his advocacy for UBI: “For years, the focus of my career has been to build a human-centered economy to improve the lives of Americans,” he wrote in a press release. The reality, he found, was that “government action” happens “too slowly.” In Hey Yang, you get the sense that he almost can’t believe how easy it was to start this company—at least compared with his other ambition of remaking politics.

Yang says that he gets told “every day” that he “was right,” but he also says that he isn’t smug about it. AI is still going to destroy jobs. Politically, he has hopes for Forward. Young people, he notes, don’t have the same loyalty to political parties as older generations do. When I asked if he might run for office again in 2028, he was coy, saying that he gets asked that question, too, “every day.” The end of Hey Yang could be interpreted as a future campaign manifesto; in between one-liners, Yang outlines his vision of an America where poverty is a thing of the past, workweeks are shorter, and technology serves people instead of the other way around: “In a world of numbers and data and money, can our humanity save us? I still hope so.”

But for now, all Yang can offer us is a cheaper phone plan. He seems happy about it. And yet I couldn’t help but feel a bit dispirited by the whole thing. Yang had looked around and seen that a lot of Americans were going to find themselves out of work. He had an idea to address the problem, rolled up his sleeves, and sacrificed a few years of his life by taking it on—only to discover that politics isn’t about solving problems. Politics is about politics.</div>

            <h2>Mike Vrabel Is Redefining NFL Coaching</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-02-05</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/2026/02/mike-vrabel-patriots-football-super-bowl/685876/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The New England Patriots coach Mike Vrabel leads from his ventricles—not from shallow-chested sentiment but from the pump action of his brawny heart, out of which blood occasionally makes its way to spurt from a split lip after a head bump from one of his players. During the team’s playoff run, the defensive tackle Milton Williams gave Vrabel a celebratory helmet to the mouth. “I forgot Vrabes ain’t got no helmet on,” Williams said, to which Vrabel, a former linebacking great, replied, “I’ve been hit harder than that.”

Anyone interested in leadership will want to take a close look at what Vrabel has done in one year of coaching the Patriots, and how he has done it. Last January, he took over a franchise that had been 4–13 in each of the past two seasons and, with a combination of hard know-how in football technique and light-handed locker-room authority, judo-flipped the team to 17–3 and a spot in the Super Bowl. A man who often seems ready to rush the field to make a tackle himself, he brings to his coaching a been-there-ness, and a drollery that treats football as the played game it is, not as the grimmest endeavor in the world.

Much of what Vrabel has done is counterintuitive. At the Patriots’ opening offseason workout in New England, he startled the players when one of the the first things he asked them to do was the “victory formation,” the kneel-down play to run out the clock when a game is won. It’s a routine action that doesn’t require much except snapping the ball, and it’s usually among the last things a team practices. Vrabel’s message: We intend to run this play a lot. He did not temper expectations. Most coaches who take over a 4–13 operation would buy themselves some time. Instead, Vrabel talked about winning the division and said, “I want to galvanize our football team. I want to galvanize this building.”

In the next months, he turned over more than half the roster, releasing a number of longtime veterans, including some members of the 2018 Super Bowl squad. Of his 53-man final roster, 30 were new players and none had been with the team more than five years. Usually, a coach with such a new collection of talent would feel urgency to install his playbook quickly. But before bothering with his system, Vrabel staged trust exercises, without any footballs in sight. One entailed setting up an obstacle course and making guys go through it blindfolded, led by a teammate from another position group. “I try to be intentional,” he said at a December press conference. The early team building, he added, was “critically important” to do “before we started dumping a bunch of plays on the guys.”

Historically, the NFL coaching profession has tended to be populated by militaristic leaders or mono-focused workaholic wonks with eyes scorched from analyzing game tape. But Vrabel wanted an outfit in which “nobody takes themselves too seriously,” he said during the playoffs. He operated as much by feel for the moment as by method, and didn’t waste time insisting upon professionalism; he simply treated players as professionals. According to Milton Williams, after the Patriots defeated the Denver Broncos in a semi-blizzard, 10–7, to win the AFC Championship, Vrabel said, “No curfew tonight. But the bus is leaving at eight in the morning, so if you ain’t on it, you ain’t playing in the Bowl.”

Such comparative easygoingness is redefining the qualities of a winning coach—at least for the Patriots. The previous man to take the team to the Super Bowl, the six-time champion Bill Belichick, was an arch headset strategist and autocrat known as “Captain Sominex” for his dark-lord voice and seeming emotional detachment. Belichick demanded excellence from his players and got it through relentless physical practice. Few dared to laugh in his presence. Vrabel asks his players for their best and says a sincere “thank you” for whatever he gets. One of his most distinctive gestures is to meet the team in the postgame tunnel for handshakes and shoulder slaps, win or lose. His players palpably love him for it. The Patriots wide receiver Stefon Diggs, who’s been to the playoffs seven previous times with the Minnesota Vikings and the Buffalo Bills, has called Vrabel “probably best coach I ever had.”

But when the Patriots play the Seattle Seahawks on Sunday, Vrabel’s philosophy will face a test—whether a team can play in the NFL without taking itself “too seriously” and still win it all.

Vrabel arrived at his style through his own personal experiences, including some lacerating ones. Drafted out of Ohio State in 1997 by the Pittsburgh Steelers, he became an undervalued backup who, in four years, never started a game. From 2001 to 2008, he rose to stardom and won three Super Bowls with the Patriots as an overachieving, desire-stoked defensive captain whose intelligence and loyal adherence to Belichick’s insistence on exacting execution made him seem indispensable—until he was traded by Belichick after he asked for too much money. Belichick delivered the news in a phone call, telling Vrabel tersely, “I traded you to Kansas City.”

Vrabel didn’t speak with Belichick for three years after that, though they would eventually reconcile at the end of his playing career, when Belichick encouraged his entry to coaching. Vrabel came away from his experience in New England feeling that Belichick had helped give him “a doctorate” in football, yet also seemingly with a clear sense of what he would do differently as a coach: rest players’ bodies and minds more, and appreciate the physicality that only a player can feel.

But as Vrabel discovered, coaching offers even less human loyalty than playing. He was hired as the head coach—and a hot prospect—of the Tennessee Titans in 2018 and made the playoffs in three out of five seasons, only to be fired by impatient ownership despite an overall winning record. He took a one-year contract as “coaching and personnel consultant” with the Cleveland Browns for 2024. Then the Patriots job opened. Belichick, too, had been fired; not even coaching a team to six Super Bowl victories can guarantee job security in the NFL. After the Patriots’ inexperienced next coach, Jerod Mayo, was also fired, Vrabel got the job because the team’s owner, Robert Kraft, knew and deeply admired him.

Still, Vrabel’s inaugural season with the Patriots didn’t begin as a pleasure trip. The team started 1–2, losing its first two games at home. The second-year quarterback Drake Maye threw an interception and fumbled in the opener against the Las Vegas Raiders. Against the Pittsburgh Steelers, Maye threw another interception, and the team lost four fumbles, including two by the running back Rhamondre Stevenson. The press hammered Stevenson, who had led the league in fumbles by a running back the previous season. Some commentators called for his benching.

What Vrabel did next alchemized his team: He stayed with Stevenson as a starter, and in his public comments cast the fumble problem as collective and fixable. His conviction was that although Stevenson needed work on securing the ball, he was one of the team’s most valuable and selfless blockers. His teammates knew this about him, but many observers missed it. Nobody on the team protected the quarterback the way Stevenson did, according to Vrabel, and he sprang crucial plays for others. Furthermore, Vrabel told the press, Stevenson’s fumbles were partly a function of other players not blocking well for him.

Vrabel’s answer was to “practice the crap out of it”—he and his coaching staff worked with Stevenson on keeping two arms wrapped around the ball. But he also encouraged the whole offense to defend Stevenson. “We also have to do a better job of protecting said person with the ball,” Vrabel said. Stevenson returned the loyalty. In Week 5, he kept his grip on the ball and tore through the line for two touchdown runs as the Patriots upset the heavily favored Buffalo Bills, on their way to a 3–2 record. Stevenson would not fumble again during the next 12 games. The new Patriots were suddenly a team to reckon with.

Vrabel uses his own player’s mentality to manage team challenges. Sometimes, that mentality can be hard-hitting. He doesn’t issue many rules, but when he does, they are firm decrees, and he can be caustic with violators. Regarding social media, he told players to speak for themselves but warned, “I wouldn’t try to go back and forth with somebody that’s got a lot of time on their hands.” He can be blunt to the point of insult, and his sheer physical size makes him intimidating to argue with. “He’s got a sarcasm that I haven’t really figured out 100 percent yet,” Maye said during the playoffs, “a little tough sarcasm where I want to laugh but you really don’t want to.”

Even so, Vrabel handles his players more gently than Belichick, who famously sent people home for being just a few minutes tardy in a snowstorm. Vrabel prefers to eye someone and assess whether he has a problem. “If somebody walks in the door at 7:45 and they just—there’s something on their face,” Vrabel said at his first press conference as head coach, “I would rather give that player 30 minutes or 45 minutes, however much time he needs to take care of the situation, than the seven hours he’s going to waste wearing it through the day.” Some football coaches (and bosses) motivate the people on their team by keeping them in a state of professional insecurity. Vrabel, however, has tended to emphasize what his players have done right. He has used his observational skill to make points not just about strategy but also about how small plays can become big gains through interconnectedness—that is, if every man “finishes” through the play, even if they feel like bystanders to the main action.

For instance: In one meeting, Vrabel showed the team a clip of a throw from Maye to Stevenson. Simple enough. But then Vrabel froze the tape and pointed out that two receivers had been open on the play, Kyle Williams along with Stevenson. Vrabel asked Williams something to the effect of: Did you want the ball? Were you upset you didn’t get the pass? Williams shrugged. Vrabel then restarted the tape and this time told the team to watch Williams. As the ball went to Stevenson, Williams turned, sprinted upfield, and leveled a defender with a block, springing Stevenson for a score. A short gain became a touchdown.

Vrabel wasn’t done. Next, he cued up tape of other receivers around the league not making those kinds of blocks for teammates. In sequence after sequence, the Patriots watched receivers who stopped running and jogged once the ball went to a different receiver on the other side of the field. Vrabel’s point was clear: The un-thrown blocks were opportunities lost, the difference between a six-yard gain and a game-breaker.

Vrabel searched for ways to make his study sessions amusing and unpredictable, especially at the end of a long practice week. On Fridays throughout the season, he would name that week’s game captains and show the team their highlights, but he would sew in some old high-school film of them as awkward teenagers, which made the guys capsize with laughter. “There’s some surprisingly bad high-school-football highlights,” Vrabel told reporters.

He assigned the hulking rookie offensive lineman Will Campbell to give a weekend update, and it became a running gag. Campbell would rise to his full 6-foot-6, 300-plus-pound mass and, in his bass-deep Louisiana accent, deliver uproariously profane accounts of how nor’easters and such might affect game conditions. By the end of the regular season, Campbell so loved Vrabel that he declared, “I don’t ever want to have to play for someone else.” He added, “This is the most fun I’ve had playing football since high school.”

Great football players almost never translate their onetime physical skills into sideline managerial ones. Early in his coaching career, asked if he had an established method such as the “Patriot Way” that Belichick had developed, Vrabel remarked, “I think to get a ‘way,’ you have to win. You have to be able to win championships before people start giving you ‘ways’ to do things.” If the Patriots defeat the Seattle Seahawks on Sunday, Vrabel will be just the fifth man in league history to win Super Bowls as both a player and a head coach. He will have proved that he’s not just a guy who had a hot season but a leader who deserves to enter the pantheon. And there will be a “Vrabel Way.”</div>

            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-02-05</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/2026/02/fallout-season-2-interview-western-explained/685890/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">For more than seven months, Walton Goggins watched a Western every day. John Ford’s films, Sergio Leone’s Dollars trilogy, episodes of Gunsmoke—the actor saw them all as he shot Fallout, the postapocalyptic TV series in which he stars. Half the time, he binged for research; Goggins thought of his character, the fictional 1950s-style movie star Cooper Howard, as a peer of cowboy-playing performers such as Alan Ladd.

“I didn’t look at them as Walton. I really looked at them as Cooper Howard,” he told me last spring on the set of Fallout’s second season. “It was like …” He slipped into character, making a dejected expression as if envious of Ladd’s career. “Okay, yeah, Alan got that role, and he was great in Shane,” Goggins, as Cooper, drawled. “I should have taken that, and I should have taken that television pilot.” He laughed. “I should have done Gunsmoke. Why didn’t I do that?!”

But the other half of the time, Goggins explained, he just needed something to stay sane. He also plays “the Ghoul,” a mutated form of Cooper who became a deadly bounty hunter after surviving the end of the world. In many episodes, Goggins switches between playing the Ghoul (in the present) and Cooper (in flashbacks). When he had to sink into the Ghoul’s ruthless mindset—and spend hours getting prosthetics applied—the actor immersed himself in tales of gunslingers, he said, so “I don’t lose my mind.”

After all, Fallout seems designed to make people’s heads spin. The series, based on a popular video-game franchise, takes place in an alternate reality in which World War II yielded a retro-futuristic society thriving on rapid technological development—that is, until a nuclear cataclysm results in civilization’s collapse. Set more than 200 years after, the story involves multiple protagonists, and its tone can careen wildly from moment to moment: a little like The Walking Dead when it leans into dystopian horror, a little like The Last Man on Earth when it indulges in absurd humor.

Yet the show most often—and most clearly—draws from what became Goggins’s on-set fixation: the Western. Season 1, among Amazon Prime Video’s biggest hits according to the streamer, injected the genre with weirdness. At the outset, the show’s three primary characters each match an archetype presented in Leone’s 1966 classic The Good, the Bad and the Ugly: There’s Lucy (played by Ella Purnell), an idealistic young woman who grew up in one of the Vaults; she treks across the wasteland to search for her father, greeting practically every obstacle with the phrase “Okey dokey!” There’s Maximus (Aaron Moten), an orphan raised by the cultlike Brotherhood of Steel, who seeks to impress the group’s leadership. And then there’s the self-serving Ghoul, who dispatches with anyone who gets in his way. The show begins with Lucy squarely as “the good,” the Ghoul representing the morally bankrupt “bad,” and Maximus caught somewhere in between as “the ugly”; these designations become intriguingly malleable over time, as both the characters and the viewers become more exposed to the reality of life in the wasteland.

Season 2, which concluded this week, challenges the traditional look of the Western, too. After primarily filming the first season in New York, the show had moved production in part to the historic Melody Ranch studio on the outskirts of Los Angeles. The property was owned by Gene Autry, the actor known as the “Singing Cowboy,” and features an archetypal Western set: a dirt-ridden main street bookended by a saloon and a general store. But, as I discovered when I visited the shoot last year, the Fallout team had built a facade over much of it to represent “New Vegas,” a postapocalyptic version of Sin City. This take on the Strip blended the ranch’s existing features with neon signage, steampunk props, and plenty of dystopian grace notes. A crew member set a car aflame for a wide shot. Another placed more tumbleweed in the path of the dozens of extras milling about. Inside one of the stores, I touched a splatter of gooey fake blood. These details underlined the show’s thematic vision as well: Westerns tend to portray the frontier as a land of opportunity, arguing that a strict set of values provides all the guidance anyone needs. But lawlessness doesn’t grant much freedom, Fallout posits. Neither does having a moral code.

The Western has proved surprisingly enduring. The genre could have easily disappeared after the concept of “manifest destiny”—the idea, explored in many stories, that the United States’ mission was to spread American values westward—grew outdated. But the Western, as the editors of the 2020 essay collection Weird Westerns: Race, Gender, Genre wrote, has “reinvented and hybridized” itself to match the country’s many cultural shifts: John Ford’s silent movies in the ’20s, for instance, reflected the post–World War I era of American exceptionalism, while his 1939 film Stagecoach featured a cast of paranoid, distrusting misfits—an appropriate quality for something released during the Great Depression. Clean-shaven, guitar-strumming cowboys played by actors such as Autry dwindled after the 1940s and ’50s, as Clint Eastwood’s hard-bitten anti-heroes emerged. Yet the genre waxed and waned in popularity amid its many transformations; in The Atlantic alone, writers have repeatedly declared the rise, death, and revival of the Western.

“There is something inherently appealing about the idea of being the master of your own destiny,” Jonathan Nolan, an executive producer of Fallout, told me, “of being in a landscape in which there is no order, there is no civilization, and it’s up to you to make these sorts of decisions.” Stories of untameable frontiers, he argued, persevere because they question society’s purpose. (He would know; Nolan co-created HBO’s Westworld, which imagined an Old West–themed amusement park populated by androids and catering to hedonistic guests.) From the roles played by the likes of John Wayne and Kevin Costner, the fantasy of the cowboy mentality—that an individual can dole out his own form of justice, and that without order comes liberation—persists.

But Fallout giddily toys with the genre’s legacy, too, at times turning homages into punch lines. In the scene I watched being filmed, the Ghoul and his newfound fellow travelers—Maximus, suited up in the Brotherhood’s coveted power armor, and Thaddeus (Johnny Pemberton), Maximus’s former squire who’s begun to mutate after an incident in Season 1—stride confidently onto a crowded main street as if they’re the stars of a Leone movie. Bystanders gawk and cheer from the sidewalks. A parade forms in their wake. And then Thaddeus’s arm falls off, embarrassing his companions.

The show isn’t always so silly. Season 2 explores where this chaos comes from, and the difficulty in distinguishing the sheriff from the outlaw. The answer comes in part from how hard it seems for the characters to hold fast to their beliefs. Lucy, for example, has been raised to respect everyone; the Golden Rule works against her in the wasteland, however, especially after she finds her father, Hank (Kyle Maclachlan), and learns of his misdeeds. The Ghoul, who takes a serum to help retain his human memories, hasn’t found salvation or satisfaction in his barbarism, just more pain. And Maximus discovers that those in the Brotherhood he most admired are fools—a harsh truth that goes for most of the authority figures in Fallout. No white-hatted cowboy can exist, the show suggests, when the world has to be saved from too much at once, including: autocratic, power-hungry leaders; warring factions across the wasteland; and, of course, the mutated creatures that haunt once-thriving cities. The notion of a virtuous do-gooder saving the day is too simplistic for this story.

In that sense, Fallout reimagines the Western’s stakes. The show’s landscape has long been mapped—and ravaged. The frontier is instead ideological, about interrogating how to reconcile a complex world into something comprehensible when doing the opposite seems easier. Over and over, people are pushed toward ignorance: Lucy’s former community is led by a woman who handles the first complaint about her alarming behavior by promising to escalate it to herself. Cooper’s wife, a Vault-Tec executive, tells him in a flashback to move past what he heard about the company’s plans to nuke the planet. Hank finishes designing a device that turns strangers he meets into sedate worker bees.

The show’s real villain is mindlessness, in other words. But this type of placid acceptance in the face of obvious danger isn’t unique to this ensemble. Fallout uses the Western’s familiar imagery and machinations to scrutinize all-too-resonant, deeply American themes: how end-stage capitalism and corporate overreach breed resentment and economic anxiety; how overzealous technocrats and self-interested leadership sow division and disorder; and how blind patriotism can undermine democracy. “All sides of the political spectrum right now are talking so much in end-of-the-world terms,” Fallout’s co-creator Geneva Robertson-Dworet told me when we spoke on set. “It actually feels like the show is sort of alarmingly prescient in a way that we’d prefer to not have.”

In Los Angeles’s Autry Museum of the West—named for Gene—hangs a painting by the artist George Carlson of a dead coyote, titled “Mayday!” The creature, left impaled on a barbed-wire fence, caught Carlson’s eye as he drove through Northern Idaho in 2022. From far away, it had looked decorative to him; close up, it was more disturbing. Dead coyotes are strung up throughout today’s rural West, but the tradition varies in meaning: Sometimes, ranchers consider the carcasses trophies; other times, they use them as warnings to other coyotes.

The painting, which I saw on a visit to the Autry last month, reminded me of a scene from Fallout. Late in Season 2, the Ghoul ends up impaled on a pillar, left for dead by Lucy after she pushes him out of a window. In this position, he’s unable to reach the serum that prevents him from losing his human consciousness, so he desperately repeats a mantra: “I’m a human being,” he says, again and again. Trapped there, Goggins manifests both versions of his character at once, flickering between flashbacks of the steady Cooper and the present-day, tortured Ghoul.

Like the strung-up coyotes, the Ghoul typically looks normal from afar but terrifying up close. That illusion epitomizes the Wild West of Fallout: The Ghoul—or whoever Cooper has become in the wasteland—rejects the Western’s either/or approach. He’s neither fully feral nor civilized, neither an avatar for freedom nor one for oppression. This season has also upended the notion presented in Season 1 that he has to act alone. A cowboy is a symbol for quintessential American values: independence, problem-solving, self-sufficiency. But obstinately embracing those qualities is, Goggins pointed out to me, “not necessarily the right way to look at the world.”

Not when the world, Fallout argues, requires reestablishing what right and wrong actually mean. The protagonists may have been forced into roles they never asked for, but they have an opportunity to question their circumstances—to find the middle ground between succumbing to basic, selfish instincts and depending on others for help. If anything, Fallout is defined by an uneasy sense of hope. “It’s not really about the end of a world; it’s about the beginning of a new one,” Nolan told me. Hitting reset without forgetting what came before is perhaps “a weird thread of optimism” for the show to follow, he conceded. But at least it’s the kind of weird that keeps people from losing their mind.</div>

In the first blush of their relationship, The Washington Post and Jeff Bezos seemed like an excellent match. Here was a paper with a strong pedigree that had fallen on somewhat hard times, and a suitor with funds who seemed eager to return it to steady glory. In 2013 Bezos purchased the paper for $250 million from the Graham family and promised a “golden era” to come. I had left the Post by then but was happy for my former colleagues. When Donald Trump took office a few years later, it was a relief to know that a journalistic institution with a record of holding White House misdeeds to account was still close by.

Yesterday, in a dismal morning Zoom call, the Post’s executive editor, Matt Murray, announced that they were laying off one-third of its already diminished staff. The follow-up email had the tone of robotic obfuscation that any decent editor would have rewritten. (“Following up on today’s communication, I’m writing to share the difficult news that your position is eliminated as part of today’s organizational changes.”) It’s of course painful, as a journalist, to see fellow journalists get laid off. It’s painful, for anyone alert to the moment, to know that one of the last remaining expert watchdogs is hobbled. It’s maybe most painful to know it could have been avoided.

In this episode of Radio Atlantic, I spoke with Joshua Benton, the founder of and a senior writer at the Nieman Journalism Lab at Harvard University. Benton has closely watched the media business for years. He explains how the newspaper reached this point, the loss to journalism, and how the future of the Post is ultimately up to Bezos.

The following is a transcript of the episode:

Hanna Rosin: Seven years ago, around this time, The Washington Post ran an ad in the Super Bowl: “Democracy dies in darkness.” It showed scenes of fires, explosions, floods, tanks—and journalists who’ve risked their lives for their profession.

All with swelling music and a voice-over by Tom Hanks.

Tom Hanks (in a Washington Post commercial): Knowing helps us decide. Knowing keeps us free.

Rosin: But then just before the Super Bowl this year, the Post took a different turn. And it was not another Super Bowl ad.

Matt Murray: Good morning, everybody. Thank you for joining us.

Rosin: On Wednesday, Post staffers joined a Zoom call first thing in the morning. Executive editor Matt Murray spoke first.

Murray:  This meeting, for our newsroom, I wanna share that the actions we are taking include a broad strategic reset with a significant staff reduction.

Rosin: The paper would be making massive cuts: closing the Sports department …

Murray:  Unfortunately, we are grappling, and have been, with, just, major changes in the way sports news is delivered, shared, and experienced across the industry.

Rosin: Downsizing their Metro desk and International desk.

Murray: … shrinking our international footprint.

Rosin: One of their reporters based in Ukraine posted to X: “I was just laid off by The Washington Post in the middle of a warzone.”

Murray:  We will continue to have a strategic overseas presence in close to a dozen locations …

Rosin: The entire Books department at the Post was cut.

Murray:  We’ll be closing the Books section.

Rosin: A suspension of their daily news show.

Murray: And we’ll be suspending the Post Reports podcast.

Rosin: Every single department would be impacted.

Murray: As I said before, these moves are painful. This is a tough day.

Now I want to turn it over to Wayne Connell, and Wayne will be sharing more about the next steps in today’s timeline.

Wayne Connell: Thank you, Matt. In the spirit of providing clarity, after our call, I will send each of you an email. The subject line will either say, “Your role is eliminated by today’s workforce reductions” …

Rosin: In less than 30 minutes, a historic journalistic institution cut its staff by almost a third, after two previous rounds of punishing layoffs.

This was the home of the Watergate investigation.

Richard Nixon: Interests of the nation must always come before any personal consideration.

Henry Kissinger: … whole file cabinets can be stolen and then made available to the press …

Rosin: Winner of dozens and dozens of Pulitzer Prizes.

Announcer: And the prize goes to The Washington Post.

Rosin: Just to break that down: a paper in the backyard of the White House and Congress that has, many times, uncovered people in power lying or grifting, or failing to do their jobs in ways that affect every single American, whether or not they live in D.C.

Not to mention all the work their reporters have done in Ukraine, and China, and the Middle East and anywhere else in the world where crisis might be brewing

There are only a handful of mainstream national journalistic institutions left with this kind of robust infrastructure—experienced editors and reporters, photographers, foreign correspondents—who can expertly monitor people in power. Particularly at this moment in American history, when those people seem to be grifting and lying in new and elaborate ways.

Whose fault is this? Why does it matter? We talk to Joshua Benton. He’s a longtime newspaper reporter and the founder of a senior writer at the Nieman Journalism Lab at Harvard University, where he writes about the media business.

Rosin: So you cover the media business; you have for a long time. You are not new to this kind of industry news. What was your reaction to the layoffs at the Post?

Benton: Well, there have been a lot of systemic difficulties in the newspaper business as long as I’ve been reporting on it. There is a large secular decline that has been brought about by the internet that has continued on without too much change. But I think the story of the Post is a very unique-to-the-Post story. It’s fundamentally about one man, Jeff Bezos, and his changing vision of what the role of the owner of a major American newspaper should be.

Rosin: So you said two different things: It’s Post-specific and it’s also related to this giant in our culture, Jeff Bezos. I mean, I know why the news resonated with me—because I’m a journalist. I live in Washington. I worked at the Post. I have many friends there.

But I can imagine people who are not in any of those categories reading this news and thinking: Layoffs happen all the time, especially newspaper layoffs. This paper still exists, even though with less staff.

So why should they care? Why is it significant for people who don’t live in Washington, aren’t journalists?

Benton: Well, for one thing, The Washington Post has always been a paper whose editorial importance was not limited to the city or to the district. It’s a national outlet. It’s one of the two largest national newspaper outlets.

It covers the happenings in Washington, D.C. Certainly there’s lots of stories to cover there. So to the extent that we have any decrease in the number of people who are paying attention to what’s going on, I think that’s a loss.

It’s also a retrenchment from what Jeff Bezos first seemed to pledge when he first purchased the paper, in 2013, which was that he would not be looking to the newspaper as a source of money. He has enough money from lots of other sources. He did seem to take seriously the idea that he was a steward of an institution, the way that the Graham family that he purchased it from had always viewed the role of being in charge of this institution that mattered to the city and to the country.

And it’s certainly true that The Washington Post has lost money and is, has declined in a number of ways financially. It’s also up to Jeff Bezos whether or not he is going to support a newspaper that is going to be robust journalistically and ambitious digitally, or whether or not he has grown tired of it and decided to step back his investment in the property.

And I think what’s troubling in this particular change is, you’re seeing what had been an institution that had really benefited from his ownership for a good long time that seems to have gone into reverse in a way that particularly aligns with the way that the political winds in Washington have blown for the last few years.

Rosin: So it sounds like what you’re saying is the reason this is significant for everybody is because how Bezos changed his mind and changed his attitude towards the paper. So can you say a little more about that? What about his change of heart is important or strikes you as important?

Benton: We saw a confluence of events in the fall of 2024 around President Trump’s second election that I think were very telling. You had, in October, Bezos making a decision on behalf of the newspaper to stop endorsing candidates for president at a time that the newspaper would have certainly been expected to—and the editorial board of the newspaper had desired to—endorse Kamala Harris. Bezos put out a statement saying that actually it’s an awful idea for a newspaper to endorse a presidential candidate, because it creates the perception of bias. And we need to have a newspaper that doesn’t sully itself with a presidential endorsement.

Almost immediately that led to a huge negative impact to the paper’s bottom line because more than 250,000 existing subscribers canceled their subscriptions, and that’s the lifeblood of a modern-day media company. Not long after that, he announced that he was going to be shifting the way that the opinion pages of the paper functioned. He would potentially be eliminating most of the left-of-center perspectives in exchange for a focus on what he called “personal liberties and free markets.” He said explicitly, We will cover other issues besides personal liberties and free markets, but we will not be running any opinions that are in opposition to those.

He never really explained which personal liberties he was especially interested in, but it became pretty clear in the coming months that he was trying to shift the Post’s editorial page and opinion section more to the right, more aligned with the new Trump administration. And in the middle of that, you had the instance of Jeff Bezos appearing at Trump’s inauguration. You had the much-discussed, recently, purchase of the Melania Trump documentary at far-above market rates in a way that has been perceived by some to be something of a bribe.

You saw in this very short period of time a shift from the Post being an establishment—an institution—that was a potentially a powerful source of constraint on any presidential administration, but in particular this one, to the Post being perceived to be traveling along with the political winds.

Rosin: So it sounds like your analysis is very Bezos focused, because you could parse the blame for what happened on a few different places. It could be ownership—Jeff Bezos, management, just the state of the industry, the product itself. But you are focused on Bezos.

Benton: One thing that Jeff Bezos knows probably better than anyone else is that digital industries tend to focus around one big winner. I mean, Amazon.com is the perfect example of this. You went from a universe of having lots of diverse small retailers in the physical world, in malls and on main streets, to having one giant that dominates the online-retail business and doesn’t allow much else to thrive outside of it in a lot of cases. That same phenomenon happens in the digital news business. It’s just that, in digital news, The New York Times is Amazon.com. They are the giant that has been able to become overwhelmingly central to the way that the digital-newspaper business works. So in that context, the self-inflicted wounds that I would argue Bezos has caused the Post to suffer were particularly damaging because it was not competing from a position of strength. It was starting off from a position of relative market weakness.

Rosin: So initially we were talking about ideological factors, like a desire to curry favor with Trump, or at least not to irritate Trump. It sounds like now you’re talking about more, sort of, financial reasons. I mean, that suggests that, what, he’s a bad businessman?

Like, we don’t think of Jeff Bezos as a bad businessman. What does that suggest?

Benton: Jeff Bezos has not historically been very involved in the management of The Washington Post. He took a very hands-off approach to management. He was not, you know, meddling in editorial decisions. He was, in a lot of ways, for the first decade or so, a pretty ideal hands-off owner for the Post who put investment into the paper, who allowed its newsroom to grow, allowed, you know, a digital-subscription strategy to thrive.

But I don’t think at any point it has been a central part of where his business instincts have been focused. I wouldn’t view his ownership of The Washington Post as primarily a business transaction.

I think you could look at the first portion of his ownership as something approaching a philanthropic goal. And I think you can look at the last couple of years primarily as trying to meet a political goal.

One of the side effects of the changes that he made in 2024 or 2025 is that it drove away an enormous number of talented journalists, including to places like The Atlantic. One reason that the Post has struggled editorially over the past year is that they lost a lot of their best reporters, their highest-profile reporters who were the best source in the White House, in Congress, in places where, you know, the stories that a newspaper can break that gets you attention, that proves to your subscribers the value of the subscription they’re paying for.

The people who produce those stories often weren’t working there anymore. And the stories that they would have been writing, breaking, that would’ve been proving the value of a digital subscription to the Post—they just weren’t getting reported.

Rosin: So this is what—when people say a “death spiral” for news outlets where you have a shrinking business, leads to a downsized product, which leads to more shrinking business. Is that where the Post is now?

Benton: The biggest shift in the financial model of newspapers that has occurred in the transition from print to digital is a decreasing reliance on advertising and an increasing reliance on direct payments from subscribers. When newspapers had something closer to a monopoly on the distribution of information every day, they were able to charge very high advertising rates and they had mass audiences.

And it was a business that worked extremely well for them for a long time. Under the print model, an American newspaper usually made about 80 percent of its money from advertising and only about 20 percent from readers buying the paper or subscribing to the newspaper. In the shift to digital, the advertising money has largely gone away, to companies like Google and Facebook, and newspapers are increasingly reliant on subscriber revenue, especially, now, digital-subscriber revenue since that’s where the audiences are.

And to succeed in a digital-subscription world, you need to convince people why they should still pay for you every month when they’re also paying for Netflix and they’re also paying for Amazon Prime and they’re also paying for the long list of subscriptions that litter, you know, the credit-card bills of probably everyone listening to this.

That is a competitive marketplace where news organizations have a real editorial burden to prove their merits over and over again, and that means that a relatively small decision, like we’re not going to endorse someone for president can have a really outsized impact because it creates, for a quarter-million people, a reason to suddenly say, You know what? It’s not worth the 10 bucks a month, the 15 bucks a month that I’m paying if they’re gonna be doing something that I find so much in opposition to my point of view.

Rosin: After the break: Should people have really expected anything better from Bezos? And should all those people really have canceled their subscriptions? That’s in a minute.

Rosin: In retrospect, now that I hear you talk and see how important that moment was when hundreds of thousands of people canceled their subscription, it was an act of protest, but now I feel like, were they protesting against the right thing and for the right place? It’s like shooting yourself in your, you know, civic-participation foot. It just doesn’t seem like they were aiming at the right target there.

Benton: Yeah, you saw at the time, when people were canceling their subscriptions, you would see on social media reporters from the Post saying: please don’t cancel the Post. We understand that you may, may not like the decision that was made by our owner, but it’s your money that allows us to keep operating, to allow us to still have jobs.

So there is a real tension there. But at the same time, for me, it’s very difficult to describe what happened at the Post as primarily a market-driven phenomenon.

The amount of money that the Post is losing is enormous to you or to me. To Jeff Bezos, it is nothing. His net worth in the past year has gone up enough to continue to pay for all the money that The Washington Post is losing for the rest of his life and the rest of his children’s lives and the rest of his grandchildren’s lives.

His wealth is at such a scale that there is no reason that a set of cuts like the one that we’ve seen this week is an economic necessity. It’s a choice.

There are enormous negative financial things happening in the digital-news business more broadly, but I think that is distinct from what is happening to The Washington Post, because that is one man’s choice fundamentally.

Rosin: And do you think that’s a reasonable expectation you’re making of Jeff Bezos? Like, he’s a businessman, and so: Why should we expect him to behave differently than the many negligent owners of many newspapers who I’m sure you’ve tracked over the last decade-plus?

Benton: You know, that’s a very reasonable question. I’d say the reason I would expect different is because he acted differently. The Washington Post was never a source of profit for him in any significant way.

When Bezos first bought the Post, in 2013, one way I’d thought about it was: There aren’t many things that a man that wealthy and that powerful can do to change something in the first few paragraphs of his obituary. When Jeff Bezos dies he will be described as the founder of Amazon.com, who, you know, created one of the great fortunes of all time.

You know, if he takes mankind to another planet, perhaps that would show up there as well. (Laughs.)

If he had saved one of the most important journalistic institutions in America, that would be another thing that would show up in those first few paragraphs, perhaps. There are reasons for someone with that much wealth to invest in something that they think is good for society, good for civilization, good for the country.

And the way he spoke when he purchased the Post was filled with language of, I’m giving you runway. I’m not a shareholder you have to pay in the same way that a publicly held or hedge-fund-purchased newspaper company would have to.

And it was the fact that that was his stance for so long, for a decade, that makes this transition, I think, somewhat jarring to people within the Post and people who read the Post.

Rosin: So it seems like the Post was struggling when Bezos bought it, and the layoffs seem to indicate it’s struggling now. But it did seem to be doing well at one point in his tenure. What made that possible, and what changed?

Benton: So our insight into the financial condition of the Bezos-era Post is really limited, because, as a privately held company, they don’t have to report any numbers to shareholders or regulators. It certainly was true, though, that they benefited starting around 2017 with the “Trump bump” that helped a lot of news organizations.

Once Trump was elected in this very unusual new federal government came into place, there was a huge increase in interest in national news that sort of raised all boats, and the Post certainly benefited from that because they were, along with the Times, one of the premier operations that was covering what was happening in Washington during this very unusual time.

So they had a huge increase in the number of subscribers that they had. They reached a peak, they reported, of around 3 million digital subscribers, which was the third-highest in the country behind the Times and also The Wall Street Journal. They were breaking stories left and right. When Bezos first appeared, he was willing to invest into increasing a lot of positions within the newsroom, adding a lot of people on the product side and on the digital side of the operation. It was a good time to be at the Post.

They also happened to have a very good editor at the time, Marty Baron, and they were blessed with the first Trump administration as a story to cover. There certainly is a universe in which you could have imagined a second Trump administration providing that same sort of bump or at least a smaller version of it to the Post.

But this is, one of the other unfortunate things about the timing is that at the exact moment that this second Trump administration was beginning was right when Jeff Bezos had shot themselves in the foot by not endorsing the presidential election and causing these 250,000 subscribers to cancel and making this pivot into having the Opinion section only be about “free markets” and the promotion of what he considers to be “personal liberties.”

I think there really was an opportunity for the Post to have another good stretch, editorially and financially. And I think you can point to some decisions that Bezos made as reasons why that didn’t happen.

Rosin: I mean, one question is, do you get the sense that the tech crowd thinks that journalism done by humans just doesn’t matter that much? Like, it’s the opposite of our future.

Benton: I’ve seen dozens and dozens of tech companies and start-ups and AI companies who tend to view news as a world of inefficiencies that are waiting to be quote-unquote “fixed.”

They look at a newsroom, which hires expensive people to do a lot of manual gathering of information and manual writing-up of that information or production of podcasts or videos about that information. They see a process that they think can be rendered more efficient and can have a lot of the cost structure ripped out of it.

I’m open to technological changes that could push in that direction. If they find wonderful ways to create that universe, you know, I’d love to hear about it. At the same time, I think, at a time that we as a society are increasingly concerned about the role of a few large technology companies and AI algorithms that we don’t have a lot of insight into, the amount of control that those institutions seem to have on very fundamental elements of the way information gets distributed, the way that the economy works—I think there’s a real disconnect in values there that I think would be pretty difficult for anyone to navigate.

Rosin: Let me just try this on you. Like, is there some alternate way that you can imagine holding government accountable? I guess I’m asking: Is journalism irrelevant? Like, is there any other way to create an informed citizenry?

Are we clinging to something that just, you know, isn’t gonna last?

Rosin: I know it’s a terrible question. I’m just trying to elicit the best argument for why anyone should care about what you even are describing as this thing that has totally different values than this other thing. And I understand this other thing to have most of the money and you know, to have, for a long time, kind of shaped our culture.

Benton: But at the same time, if you look at a place like Minneapolis and you look at the power that video images of things happening in the streets, to someone like Renee Good: The impact that the right information can have on a political body; on a citizenry; on a populace; on a protest movement; eventually, on a government—that power, in my mind, hasn’t been diminished.

It used to be that it was much more the realm of individual reporters and individual newspapers and television networks to dig up this information and to share this information. Now there are many more potential inputs into that system, right?

But that doesn’t, to my mind, reduce the power that information—accurate, timely information about the world around us—can have in how society and government work. I think that we had a sort of unusual glory period for a number of decades across the 20th century where the things that were healthy for our democracy were also things that aligned really well with an advertising-driven business model.

It didn’t make a lot of sense at an intellectual level that the same people who would be reporting on what’s happening in Baghdad or what’s happening on some distant battlefield would be putting their work right next to furniture-store ads and classified ads for jobs and all the other things that created this unusual mixture of elements that was 20th-century mass media.

We were kind of lucky that those happened to align for a while. And they very much do not align anymore. I think the shift away from relying on advertising and relying on subscribers and people willing to invest, essentially, in what they see as being useful for democracy is a potential route to stability, in that—you know, The New York Times has been able to navigate that extremely well. They’re a much bigger business than they’ve ever been before and still doing lots of excellent journalism, though I’m sure everyone can critique any number of pieces of it.

I still think that there is an enormous amount of value in the work that journalists do, and there are models out there. And one of those models that a lot of people, for a while, had some hope in was philanthropically minded billionaires who would see the value in what journalism was doing, and also have the capacity to remove it from the marketplace of capitalism, at least to a degree.

And I think Jeff Bezos did that for a while, to a certain degree. So I think that’s why it’s extra-frustrating to see him instead shoving The Washington Post right back into that marketplace and saying, Oh no, now I have to make the same sort of decisions that someone who, you know, a struggling businessman who is worried about paying his mortgage might have to make—to make the difficult cuts.

That’s what makes it difficult—that this is very much a choice. This is a choice that one man made that is going to harm a lot of journalists and is going to harm a lot of people who would have benefited from the journalism.

Rosin: Okay, so: Is there a path forward for The Washington Post?

Benton: That’s entirely up to Jeff Bezos. He could decide to convert The Washington Post into a nonprofit. He could decide to keep shrinking and keep cutting. He could decide to invest again in anything that he’s decided not to invest in. It’s a property that he has total and complete control over. I think there is a path forward for good journalism.

The Post benefits from its incredible history and the relationships it has built up over the decades in Washington and beyond. But it’s also hamstrung by that history and by the fact that it is built out as a print business that has shifted towards digital as opposed to being a digital-first business, right. There are paths forward, and it’s really up to one man to decide if he chooses to take any of them.

            <h2>The Only Thing That Will Turn Measles Back</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-02-05</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/2026/02/measles-vaccination-rebound-when/685889/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Since measles vaccination became common among Americans, the logic of outbreaks has been simple: When vaccination rates fall, infections rapidly rise; when vaccination rates increase, cases abate. The United States is currently living out the first half of that maxim.

Measles-vaccination rates have been steadily declining for several years; since last January, the country has logged its two largest measles epidemics in more than three decades. The second of those, still ballooning in South Carolina, is over 875 cases and counting. In April, measles may be declared endemic in the U.S. again, 26 years after elimination.

When and if the maxim’s second part—a rebound in vaccination—might manifest “is the key question,” Paul Offit, a pediatrician and vaccine expert at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, told me. Experts anticipate a shift eventually. Vaccine coverage has often been beholden to a kind of homeostatic pull, in which it dips and then ricochets in response to death and suffering. In 2022, for instance, in the weeks after polio paralyzed an unvaccinated man in Rockland County, New York, the families of more than 1,000 under-vaccinated children heeded advice to immunize.

During past outbreaks, though, health authorities at local, state, and federal levels have given that same advice—vaccinate, now—loudly, clearly, and persistently. In 2026, the U.S. is facing the possibility of more and bigger measles outbreaks, as federal leaders have actively shrunk vaccine access, dismissed vaccine experts, and sowed doubts about vaccine benefits. Under these conditions, many experts are doubtful that facing down more disease, even its worst consequences, will convince enough Americans that more protection is necessary.

After the first major rash of measles cases appeared in and around West Texas about this time last year, many local families did rush to get vaccines, including early doses for infants; some families living near South Carolina’s outbreak, now bigger than West Texas’s was, have opted into free vaccination clinics too. Even in states far from these epidemics, such as Wisconsin, health-care providers have seen an uptick in vaccination, Jonathan Temte, a family-medicine physician and vaccine-policy expert at the University of Wisconsin at Madison, told me. But, he said, those boosts in interest have been concentrated primarily among people already enthusiastic about vaccination, who were seeking additional protection as the national situation worsened. At the same time, many of South Carolina’s free vaccination clinics have been poorly attended; some community members hit by the worst of the outbreak in West Texas have stood by their decision to not vaccinate.

Protection against measles has always been fragile: Sky-high levels of vaccination—at rates of at least 92 to 95 percent—are necessary to stave off outbreaks. And after holding steady for years, uptake of the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine has been dropping unevenly in communities scattered across the U.S. since around the start of the coronavirus pandemic, pulling down the nationwide average. Recent research from a team led by Eric Geng Zhou, a health economist at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, has found that, although many communities in the Northeast and Midwest have generally high MMR-vaccine uptake, others in regions such as West Texas, southern New Mexico, and the rural Southeast, as well as parts of Mississippi, don’t have much protection to speak of.

COVID can bear some of the blame for these patches of slipping vaccination. It disrupted families’ routine of visits to the pediatrician, leading to delayed or missed vaccinations. Those interruptions quickly resolved for some families, Zhou told me, but they remained for many others, lagging, for instance, among people of lower socioeconomic status who are less likely to have consistent access to health care and reliable health information. At the same time, the pandemic deepened political divides over public-health policies, including vaccination. In the years since, Republicans have become substantially more hesitant than Democrats about immunizing their children. “The COVID pandemic created this persistent divergence,” Zhou told me.

Pockets with under-vaccinated people have always existed, tracking alongside groups that are less likely to engage with all kinds of medical care, including people with less education or lower income, or those who belong to certain ethnic minorities. Anti-vaccine activists—including Robert F. Kennedy Jr., now the secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services—have also spent years spreading misinformation about the vaccine. But maybe most crucial, vaccination status clusters in communities—depending intimately on whether, for instance, children are raised by parents who are themselves vaccinated. The net effect of COVID, misinformation, and changing political tides is that the chasms between the vaccinated and unvaccinated have widened, an especially dangerous proposition for measles, a virus that is estimated to infect 90 percent of the unimmunized people it encounters.

Last year, as measles ignited in West Texas, some experts wondered whether attitudes about the MMR vaccine might shift once the virus killed someone. Since the start of 2025, three unvaccinated people have died from measles, two of them young children. But because that outbreak centered on several rural Mennonite communities that have long been distrustful of vaccines, many Americans seem to have treated those three deaths as a mostly isolated problem, Noel Brewer, a vaccine-behavior expert at the University of North Carolina Gillings School of Global Public Health, told me. (Brewer was a member of the CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices before Kennedy overhauled the group entirely last year.)

More broadly, the disease still has a misleading reputation as harmless enough that “it’s not a big deal if you get it,” Rupali Limaye, a vaccine-behavior expert at Johns Hopkins University, told me. But even if measles’ severe outcomes were more common, Limaye and others were doubtful that many more Americans would be moved to act. COVID vaccines still offer protection against the disease’s worst outcomes, yet so far this winter, just 17 percent of adults and 8 percent of children have gotten a COVID shot. And although the seasonal flu typically hospitalizes hundreds of thousands of people in the U.S. each year, tens of thousands of whom die, flu-vaccine uptake regularly hovers below 50 percent. For measles, “how many deaths is enough to be a tipping point?” Offit asked. “I don’t know that.”  If anything, the nation’s top health officials have encouraged people to embrace the tolls of infectious illness. The Trump administration responded to the deaths last year with relatively tepid messages about the benefits of measles vaccines—which are excellent at preventing severe illness, infection, and transmission—all while promoting nutritional supplementation with vitamin A. More recently, CDC’s new principal deputy director, Ralph Abraham, described the prospect of measles becoming endemic in the U.S. as “just the cost of doing business.” Last month, CDC ended long-standing recommendations urging all Americans to receive an annual flu shot; later that week, Kennedy told CBS News that it may be a “better thing” if fewer kids get vaccinated against the flu. And Kirk Milhoan, the new chair of CDC’s vaccine advisory committee, recently questioned the need for the MMR vaccine, arguing that measles’ risks may now be lower than they once were, in part because hospitals are better equipped to treat the disease than they used to be.

When reached for comment over email, Andrew G. Nixon, the deputy assistant secretary for media relations at HHS, disputed the notion that the department has hindered the country’s response to measles, writing, “Under Secretary Kennedy, CDC surged resources and multiple states declared measles outbreaks over in 2025.” He added that “Secretary Kennedy and other leaders at HHS have consistently said that vaccination is the best way to prevent the spread of measles.”

The counsel of health-care providers, not federal health officials, remains a top predictor of whether people will immunize. But when vaccine uptake has wavered in the past, governments have been key to buoying those levels again. In the 1970s, for example, after safety concerns about a whooping-cough vaccine—later proved false—caused rates of uptake to plummet in the United Kingdom and spurred a series of major outbreaks, an eventual government-sponsored campaign helped limit the dip in vaccination to a few years. In the 2010s, rising rates of families seeking nonmedical exemptions for vaccination in California helped precipitate the state’s Disneyland measles outbreak, which spread to six other states, as well as Canada and Mexico; MMR-vaccination rates throughout California jumped above 95 percent only after new state legislation strengthened school mandates. And in the early 1990s, local health officials ended a Philadelphia measles epidemic—which by then had sickened at least 1,400 people and killed nine children—after they took the extreme step of getting a court order to compel community members to vaccinate children.

When governments withdraw support for vaccines, immunization rates can crater. In 2013, an unfounded safety concern about the HPV vaccine prompted Japanese health authorities to suspend strong national recommendations for the immunization; the move caused uptake among adolescent and young teenage girls to drop, from about 70 to 80 percent to less than 1 percent within a year, according to Brewer, who is co-authoring a research paper on the subject. Japan did not reinstate its HPV recommendation until nearly a decade later—and coverage has since recovered to only about half of its original baseline.

Nixon, the HHS spokesperson, wrote that the U.S. is now following the approach of peer nations that “achieve high vaccination rates without mandates by relying on trust, education, and strong doctor-patient relationships.” But Kennedy has also publicly discouraged people from “trusting the experts.” Limaye, who consults with local health-care providers, said that the biggest question that her contacts are now hearing from patient families is “Who am I supposed to believe?” Meanwhile, CDC’s website now contradicts the widespread and decades-long scientific consensus that vaccines don’t cause autism.

If MMR-vaccine uptake does rebound, experts suspect it will rise unevenly across the country, likely skirting the politically red regions where vaccination rates most urgently need to increase. In this way, the self-reinforcing nature of vaccination status is dangerous: Even while highly protected groups might double down on immunization, under-vaccinated groups can remain unprotected. Leaving enough places lingering below the crucial measles-vaccination threshold “will ensure repeated and large outbreaks,” Brewer said. West Texas and South Carolina were just the start; this year, measles will sicken more people, which means more deaths will follow, and likely soon. The Trump administration is testing how much resilience American vaccination rates have in the absence of federal support, and the answer emerging for measles so far is: not enough.</div>

Calling the Trump administration fascist has become a cliché, but some federal departments seem keen on the comparison. Consider the administration’s messaging on social media.

The Department of Homeland Security’s Facebook account recently posted a recruiting notice for ICE under the banner “WE’LL HAVE OUR HOME AGAIN”—the title of a white-nationalist anthem by the Pine Tree Riots (“By blood or sweat, we’ll get there yet”). The Department of Labor recently posted a video montage referencing American battle scenes under the tagline “One Homeland. One People. One Heritage. Remember who you are, American”—a slogan close to the Nazi-era Ein Volk, ein Reich, ein Führer.

Many of these posts borrow overtly from Christianity. In December, the DHS and White House accounts shared Christmas-themed posts celebrating mass deportations and encouraging self-deportation. One featured videos of armed agents performing night raids, with a caption quoting Matthew 5:9 in black-letter type: “Blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be called sons of God.”

Macho displays and transgressive memes mark a significant shift in how the federal government sees and promotes its mission—and sanctions state violence. It may be tempting to see this change as an organic or bottom-up phenomenon, as if federal agencies are appealing to Proud Boys to lure more ICE recruits. But the reality is that this transformation is the culmination of years of work by niche groups of conservative intellectuals who have long rejected America’s liberal traditions—and now dominate the halls of power.

There were signs from the start that a Trump-led GOP would reward transgression against liberal-democratic norms. In “The Flight 93 Election,” a September 2016 essay for the Claremont Institute, the former George W. Bush speechwriter Michael Anton called on fellow conservatives to “charge the cockpit” and vote for Trump in order to prevent a more dire outcome: the election of Hillary Clinton as president. Anton, who went on to serve on the National Security Council in Trump’s first term and the State Department in his second, used his polemic to decry Davos-style globalist pieties as “managerial Davoisie liberalism” and hail Trump’s plans to stop “importing poverty, crime, and alien cultures.” Trump, he allowed, “is worse than imperfect,” but this didn’t matter. Trump, Anton argued, offered a lifeline for an irrelevant conservative movement and a dying republic.

This call to arms scandalized many establishment conservatives, some of whom provided a check on Trump in his first term. Members of Trump’s first cabinet prevented him from ratcheting up his trade war, fully alienating allies, deploying U.S. troops to American cities, and withdrawing them suddenly from overseas.

After the “Unite the Right” rally turned deadly in Charlottesville, Virginia, in 2017, the alt-right appeared to lose steam. The White House chief strategist Steve Bannon fell from grace, the white nationalist Richard Spencer mostly vanished from the public eye, and controversial figures including Sebastian Gorka and Darren Beattie were ultimately ousted from the administration. Even Stephen Miller looked vulnerable for a time. Many conservatives assumed that the events of January 6, 2021, would rightfully prevent Trump from holding public office ever again.

Instead, January 6 came to signify the staying power of Trumpism, and offered a new rallying cry and loyalty test for a more radicalized GOP.

In October 2021, the Heritage Foundation tapped Kevin Roberts, the former CEO of the Trump-friendly Texas Public Policy Foundation, to be its next president—marking a change in orientation for one of Washington’s most influential conservative think tanks. At the National Conservatism Conference in 2022, Roberts declared his “fellowship with the principles” MAGA’s main intellectual movement had advanced “to rescue America from the barbarians inside the gates of our very own institutions.” At the same gathering, the natcon leader Yoram Hazony argued that Christian domination is the only safeguard against “the religion of woke neo-Marxism.”

Today, elite MAGA-world figures including Anton and Peter Thiel flirt openly with the idea of Caesarism, or a “Red Caesar,” whereby a lone authoritarian ruler might restore the country’s strength. “Postliberals” such as Patrick Deneen write about how “regime change” is possible only with a new elite—one that understands the value of “Machiavellian means to achieve Aristotelian ends.” The influential philosopher-blogger Curtis Yarvin has called for a total dismantling of “the cathedral,” by which he means the all-powerful liberal institutions at the center of modern life (universities, media outlets), which operate like a Church in that they dictate how people should think.

George Packer: An anatomy of the MAGA mind

What unifies these thinkers is a totalizing and conspiratorial conception of modern liberal politics. In this view, very little in the existing order is worth redeeming. Some even argue that the most patriotic way forward is simply to burn it all down.

All of this intellectual boundary-breaking can be intoxicating, especially against the backdrop of a wider culture that has at times tipped into stultifying speech codes and groupthink. But the rebellion has also spurred a race to the bottom. This is how a group chat among young Republicans devolves into talk of loving Hitler.

Richard Hanania, a political scientist who knows a good deal about such dynamics owing to the years he spent writing pseudonymously for alt-right and white-supremacist publications, calls this phenomenon the “based ritual.” Young ideologues compete to prove their fealty to MAGA by engaging in a kind of transgressive one-upmanship. In this performance, the risk of appearing racist or sexist is well outweighed by the risk of seeming disloyal to Trump.

Prominent conservatives have publicly discussed the value of shifting the Overton window. In 2023, Christopher Rufo hosted a debate about whether to broaden the tent to include racists and other extremists—a “no enemies to the right” strategy.

This is very much a live question. In October, after Tucker Carlson hosted the young white-nationalist influencer Nick Fuentes in a long and indulgent interview on his podcast, quite a few conservatives struggled to distance themselves from Fuentes without alienating other political allies. Roberts, at the Heritage Foundation, raised hackles when he initially defended Carlson. He then tried to split the difference by criticizing Fuentes but not Carlson, but still faced an exodus of staff and several resignations from the board of trustees for legitimizing extremism. Clearly some conservatives are still willing to hold the more radical factions of the party to account.

Jonathan Chait: The conservative movement’s intellectual collapse

Unfortunately, these traditional, more principled conservatives are not ascendant. In the early days of the Heritage fiasco, Harvard’s Adrian Vermeule, perhaps the most sophisticated thinker of the MAGA new right, warned against factional infighting when the enemy is “at the very gates.” What is notable here is that for Vermeule, the “enemies” are liberals. Such language handily buttresses Trump’s constant talk of the “enemy from within.” It’s a philosophy that allows the administration to portray liberal activists as domestic terrorists, and mass peaceful protests as “engineered chaos.”

That kind of edgelordism has become the currency du jour in the GOP, from the Ivy League through the streets of Minnesota. The MAGA new right seems to be betting that the American polity has a deep reserve of untapped nativist rage—which can be harnessed in the service of their culture war against the liberal status quo, or of ICE’s more tangible goals. But if current polls are to be believed, the administration seems to be underestimating the everyday decency and patriotism of the American public.

Boundary-pushing ideas can be invigorating, and opportunities to question and resist received wisdom are essential to any free and democratic society. But the pursuit of transgression for its own sake can easily derail sound judgment. The risk is in presuming that anything subversive or sensational is also true and meaningful, and that anything conventional is a lie that must be smashed down. That is a brutal way to inhabit the world—and, I hope, a losing one.

I guess it&#39;s just an Elo score, though I&#39;m not clear why they all caps it? https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elo_rating_system [wikipedia.org]

I think because most people incorrectly assume it&#39;s an acronym and not the guys name that invented it.

But to be clear to the GP, that doesn&#39;t mean &quot;it&#39;s a 10% better model&quot;.  For most queries that one does for any two models, most of the generations / fixes will be &quot;good&quot;, and so it&#39;s just basically a coin flip as to which model to choose (&quot;I like this one&#39;s documentation more&quot;, &quot;This one&#39;s fix was more concise&quot;, &quot;This model was more polite&quot;, etc).  10% is actually a pretty big difference and reflect the cases where one model was unambiguously better than the other.

You really should do the math.  11 days, which is a still a long time.
The purpose of this type of storage is for use cases where the touch rate is very long.  For data that is updated/accessed once a year in very big chunks, these work.I think he meant the time it would take to scan one such disk full of justice department evidence for cases of corruption.

Today they offer  32TB drives on SATA 6gpbs... If that is &#39;acceptable&#39; then reading the entire drive takes at least 18 hours or so in theory.  If same interface, then you&#39;d be limited to 78 hours...

But wait, there&#39;s been talk about spinning platters being upgraded to NVME interfaces.  Largely because &quot;why accommodate spinning drives with a separate interface&quot;, but if this comes in, and could credibly in that timeframe have NVMe with PCIe 6, then the total drive read time could be reduced to about 90 minutes, in theory.

So in theory, such a drive with a credible storage interface could push this in a more reasonable time period.  Historically spinning platters seek performance made the nvme overkill, but streaming performance with that many platters and that density may remedy the &#39;drive too big&#39; problem.  Of course, in the *consumer* market this means that systems would have to start accommodating that sort of connectivity... Of course, in the timeframe perhaps the drives would just use USB to connect, and could credibly connect at 120Gbps, which would mean about 180 minutes of time to read the full time...

In short, it&#39;s time to move to PCIe connectivity to tame these capacities...

Well they assert 140TB in 14 platters, so 10 TB/platter suggests that it would be about a 3x increase in density over current state of the art

Further, number of platters, since your array of drive heads could read from 14 platters concurrently in a single drive interface, if you could get the drive to read everything to you in the order that is best for it.

So if your number is accurate for current platters, then for the hypothetical indicated, you would at least be in PCIe 5 x4 territory, for streaming perf

I was surprised to discover that you can purchase a 30TB hard drive for about half a grand.

That&#39;s 30,000 gigabytes, or about 30,000 hours of recorded video. How much of a person&#39;s life could be recorded on this?

There&#39;s about 8800 hours in a year, but you&#39;re asleep for 1/3 of that  so call it 6000 hours. You can get 5 years of continuous video of your life on a device the size of a paperback book. If you can compress the video of your mundane activities, such as driving to/from work or waiting in line, only

Will you be able to write the whole disk before it fails ?

I welcome this new improved data loss mechanism; now instead of losing a terabyte or two, you can lose 140TB all at once.

And that&#39;s because backing up a 140TB drive is a bitch. Backing up a datacenter full of them is worse.

You back it up to another 140TB drive and hope both don&#39;t fail. And then back it up to a third 140TB drive just in case.

And a fourth copy to put in the fireproof safe.

And a fifth copy in case there&#39;s a fire in the fireproof safe.

No, no, you go to erasure coding across disks, then you&#39;re down to well under two copies. Unless you want to be able to read it immediately.

I like my g&#39;old reliable HDDs, but HDD technologies seems pretty much stagnant since more than a decade. Today&#39;s a 2TB HD cost pretty much the same as a 2010&#39;s 2TB HD, same speed, same everything.Meanwhile I heard a lot of promises but none of them did hit the shelves.Plus, SSDs got more robust and were getting close to same $/TB of HDs, this trend only stopped due to the recent RAM/Flash shortages (thanks AI big techs).I&#39;d love to see HDDs to make such a comeback, but I&#39;m not holding my breath.

HDDs have also become much more difficult to find at reasonable prices lately. The one I bought in December is now nearly twice as expensive.

I also ordered a decently-priced USB external drive from Amazon in January which didn&#39;t say anything about being out-of-stock but is now saying to expect delivery in March. I&#39;m guessing they&#39;ll cancel the order at some point because it will probably cost them more than I paid.

Lack of demand is going to limit the research and technology advancement.We could improve HDD someone wants to put up the money and wait a long while. I guess blame capitalism in that it doesn&#39;t solve everything, at least not on consumer demand alone.

At some point it can only be so cheap. The cost of churning out boards, packaging the things, and handling warranties and such puts a hard floor on the cost. They&#39;re making their billions in the same way Change Bank makes theirs.

You&#39;re correct. Who wants a 2TB HDD to be faster and cheaper when you can buy an SSD that&#39;s 100x faster? The technology is for bulk storage and that&#39;s what they&#39;ve been investing in. You couldn&#39;t get a 22TB HDD in 2010 for a reasonable price. You can now. HDDs are never going to make a comeback for primary storage, but for bulk storage they&#39;re king.

Seemed stupid for sharks, but maybe it&#39;s better for hard drives?

One thing I&#39;m wondering is about changing form factors.  For SSDs, the current NVMe form factors and such make sense.  However, HDDs need a new form factor.  2.5&quot; HDDs are pretty much abandoned with the last space increase to 6 TB happening a year or two ago.  3.5&quot; HDDs really need more height to allow for more disks to be stacked or more room to place platters.

Maybe we need to bring back the 5.25&quot; full height form factor?  It obviously would not work with the 1-3 rack unit systems, so the drives would have to go in an external rack and be hooked up via SAS, FC, or some other protocol.  Or maybe start clean completely and have a format that is future-resistant and can grow in whatever dimensions are needed.

RAID5 became dangerous because of the size of disks. RAID6 is pretty close to having the same issue. I wonder how possible close to reality a RAID7 is?

On the plus side, TV has hit rock bottom decades ago, and films aren&#39;t far behind. Using AI to make shit faster is kind of fitting really.

On the plus side, TV has hit rock bottom decades ago,

No it didn&#39;t. The last 15 years have arguably been the high point of TV.

Decades ago, let&#39;s say 30 years to 20 years. Well, 30 years ago was about the first ever show with an entire multi-season story arc plotted out in advance (Babylon 5). There were of course many missteps because literally no one had done it before and the studio had no fucking idea what to do with it. It probably took another 10 years before people finally figured out how to execute such a thing. And now they&#39;ve got good at properly executing single and multi-season arcs.

That&#39;s not to say there aren&#39;t some decent shows from the 90s and 2000s. There were a lot of shows after all, but quite a lot of them feel somewhat dated. Slow moving, clunky plots, weird retconning and plot holes due to lack of proper planning.

Hindsight + nostalgia + Sturgeon&#39;s Law [wikipedia.org] is a hell of a combo. The 90&#39;s and 00&#39;s had some great shows but also had a ton of trash that is just forgotten about today.  There are also great shows on today but all the crap is right in front of us so we are more aware of it but the ratio never changes.

This is true and yet I also feel like the last ten years have been obviously an improvement so I can&#39;t figure out why someone would say such a thing. While some of my favorite TV shows in my life time might predate that timeframe, it&#39;s hard to argue that the competition between streaming services hasn&#39;t resulted in an extremely diverse, original, and high quality set of TV shows that wouldn&#39;t have been made in the past because they wouldn&#39;t be considered mass market enough.

No it didn&#39;t. The last 15 years have arguably been the high point of TV.What would you say is the best TV of the last 15 years?

No it didn&#39;t. The last 15 years have arguably been the high point of TV.

What would you say is the best TV of the last 15 years?

My list of TV shows I&#39;ve enjoyed from 2010 on would include.

Breaking Bad (started 2008)Parks and Rec (started 2009)The Office (started 2005)30 Rock (started 2006)Mad Men (2007)Severance (new!)Ted Lasso (only the first season)

So other than Ted Lasso and Severance, my list is entirely things that were already running by 2010 (and some would say peaked by then).

The only shows I&#39;m currently watching are Fallout (I&#39;m only two episodes into season 1) and A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms--both seem fun so far.

> On the plus side, TV has hit rock bottom decades ago,

Well yeah, it kinda sucked in the mid-seventies. But it&#39;s gotten way better since. It&#39;s really good right now, in part because of the (alas, unsustainable) competition between the streaming services.

While there have been times TV hasn&#39;t been good, now&#39;s not that time. Alas though, it sounds as if an era of shitty clip-show level crap is nearly upon us, given this article.

No time + AI = slopFull time + AI = better than without AILess time + AI = depends (for example on how much less time)

Simple to see. If you have the full time, the AI benefits come on top. As more as you reduce the time allowed for the production, the more the AI has to do. And somewhere is the break even at which people notice that AI doesn&#39;t do everything on its own when given a prompt, but needs a human who knows what they are doing.

Some will surely surpass the average tiktoker...

AI doesn&#39;t have to be used to generate the plot, it could be used for say reviewing scripts or first draft edits. Faster than a human, and even though it&#39;s unreliable it may catch some genuine issues that can be corrected before being passed to human review.

Another example would be taking a storyboard or script and using it to make a rough cut, which can then be edited properly.

The danger is that it becomes a crutch. Say the writers are struggling with a scene or a plot point, they turn to AI for ideas, and

I gave up on Rings of Power after a few episodes. The Boys is good though.

Didn&#39;t they have Lower Decks? That was good. Fallout is okay, but I haven&#39;t played the games.

Bosch was good for the first 6-7 seasons.

So it&#39;s going to be someone&#39;s fap material that stops abruptly because the author reached climax before they could write down all the nonsensical words.

&quot;Amazon Plans To Use AI To Speed Up TV and Film Production&quot;

TRANSLATION: &quot;Amazon Plans To Use AI To Churn Out Shitloads of Utter Garbage&quot;

Have you not watched Fallout?  Amazon has some solid originals.  Bezos may be a greedy dickhead, but his company is making some worthy stuff.Not anymore. It&#39;s all gonna be AI shit produced for pennies.

Have you not watched Fallout?  Amazon has some solid originals.  Bezos may be a greedy dickhead, but his company is making some worthy stuff.

Not anymore. It&#39;s all gonna be AI shit produced for pennies.

So no matter how quickly you can make a movie, it still takes an 80-100 or whatever minutes to watch it.

So they need more consumers. This is where agents come in.

They just need to convince people to want to own a series of robots to be entertained for them. I&#39;m sure they could come up with a &quot;vibe-viewing&quot; UI to managing your little virtual popcorn-eaters - maybe Nintendo could help, they&#39;re good at that sort of thing.

And then kids could humiliate each other over how much media their peers are wasting without experiencing.

It will be quite impossible to mass-produce individually rendered streams of AI slops at a cost that is acceptable to the punter.

And beyond. Such a thing won&#39;t pay for itself.

Just like manned flight will never be possible, no one will ever be able to harness the power of nuclear forces, and no one will ever be able to go to the Moon.

Sounds about right for Hollywood these days. Gonna fire up some Gilligan&#39;s Island tonight. At least slop made in the 60&#39;s was still watchable.

Their wording specifically sounds like they&#39;re not working on tools where you can &quot;prompt your way into a movie,&quot; but rather tools that are designed to act as a force multiplier on creatives&#39; labor.

I saw a demo video involving anime about a year ago. The tool basically allowed a single artist to draw out their animation and then tell the model to go through frame-by-frame and clean up rough edges and stuff like that. Basically grunt work that low-paid artists in Korea might do for creators in Japan.

Basically grunt work that low-paid artists in Korea might do for creators in Japan.But how will these low-paid artists learn their craft???Wait, this is Slashdot:  AI is taking away jobs of entry-level programmers.  How will entry-level programmers learn their craft?

&quot;Hollywood fears that AI will cut jobs and permanently reshape the industry.&quot;

First, there are no studios in Hollywood, second, thousands of model makers lost their jobs to CGI and nobody made a fuss.

That was shitty in the beginning as well, it will be the same thing here, just with higher resolution from the get-go.

I have solved the tv and movie problem.  I&#39;ve trained my AI to watch all the shows for me, and now I have tons of free time to do more pleasant things.

The good news. Creative people can use the AI tools to realize their ideas without the staff or money required to do it the old way.The bad news. Artless mercenaries will be able to churn out overwhelming quantities of crap faster, cheaper and easier.

Throughout all of history advances in technology have been primarily billed at making it easier to make movies. From the move to miniature sets, digital cameras, different technologies for separating characters from backgrounds, e.g. green screening existed to speed up rotoscoping...

AI is a tool. Of course it was going to be used in Hollywood. They&#39;ve attempted to use literally everything ever developed to help speed up film making.

More crap, faster. That&#39;s what the world needs.

hey musicians, they&#39;re doing this with YOUR money.

If you already have the physical book, why would you want to suddenly jump to an audio version of it?  I can&#39;t see that market being huge.  The only scenario I can think of is if you are reading the book, and you want to continue &#39;listening&#39; to it when you can&#39;t read it (driving in a car, etc.)   Most people I know (including myself) are kind of one way or another, they either like reading real books, or listening to audio books.   I&#39;m a real book person, but I do listen to a number of podcasts by authors o

Audio books have never made sense to me, even if I could point out where in an audio clip I want to go.  That&#39;s b&#39;cos I read faster than what anyone can talk, and sometimes, I may not understand one&#39;s pronunciation of certain words.  But I do prefer e-books to slaughtered trees: it saves me from having to have shelves, where those books can gather dust, pages can rot...  As opposed to that, I can have electronic copies of books on my Nook app, or on my iPad, or even, if I want, on storage media.  Searching

Bookshop.org is backed by a single large book publisher/warehouse company that essentially works with indie bookstore brands to promote sales by giving customers a way to shop local without shopping local.

Imagine you attend a protest, like hundreds of thousands of Americans have since President Donald Trump began his second term. Perhaps it is a No Kings event, or a local ICE demonstration to protest Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s crackdown on immigrants in your community. During the protest, you take a video of yourself and your fellow protesters, caption it “Abolish ICE,” and upload it to Instagram. A few weeks later, there’s a knock on your door. Federal agents stand before you, demanding to question you.

You’re wondering to yourself: Do they know about the protest I attended? Are they legally allowed to track me? Do I have to comply?

The answer to these first two questions is, shockingly, yes, and it’s made possible in part by a little-known power that the Trump administration has supercharged in recent months. The answer to the last question is much more complicated. The Department of Homeland Security is one of a number of federal agencies with something called administrative subpoena power, and it has been leveraging that tool in unprecedented ways under Trump 2.0. The Washington Post detailed these abuses this week, focusing on the story of a U.S. citizen targeted by DHS for simply emailing a federal prosecutor his opinion about the federal government’s case against an Afghan national facing deportation.

How can something like this happen? Congress has granted administrative subpoena power to federal agencies, like the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Federal Trade Commission, and the Federal Communications Commission, to allow them to access information quickly to make decisions about issues under their purview. A key distinction between administrative subpoenas and civil or criminal ones is that federal agencies do not need a judge’s sign-off. These agencies retain the power to approve administrative subpoenas themselves. This also means that agencies can demand documents without needing to prove that there is an ongoing investigation into or probable cause against a person when issuing administrative subpoenas.

Federal agencies are not legally required to disclose how many administrative subpoenas they issue, but under the Trump administration, unnamed sources told the Post, the volume of administrative subpoenas is “well into the thousands, if not tens of thousands.” Lindsay Nash, a professor at Cardozo School of Law, authored a study on the immigration subpoena power and found, through publicly available regulations and internal records, that ICE has empowered its employees—even those focused on civil immigration enforcement—“to demand records and testimony from any person or entity in order to obtain information for any civil or criminal investigation within the agency’s broad domain.”

“At present, there is generally no requirement that officers have probable cause, identify the suspected violation, or exercise restraint,” Nash wrote. This is being exemplified with abuses like the one documented in the Post story, plus footage of federal agents taking pictures of protesters and threatening to add them to “a nice little database,” which some anonymous national security officials claim does in fact exist as a way for DHS and the FBI to track people labeled as “domestic terrorists.” (DHS publicly denies that there is such a database.)

The Trump administration’s heavy use of administrative subpoenas comes as the judiciary—including Republican-appointed judges—has been turning against its immigration enforcement tactics. Just this week, a court blocked the White House from ending temporary protected status for over 350,000 Haitian immigrants living in the U.S., while the chief judge of the District of Minnesota concluded that ICE has most likely violated more court orders in January alone than “some federal agencies have violated in their entire existence.”

Administrative subpoenas are a convenient work-around for an administration that knows it faces an uphill battle if it takes its information requests to a judge, a process that requires a formal investigation. Instead of having to meet a strict legal standard, DHS can issue administrative subpoenas to private individuals, tech companies, schools, state governments, and other entities in order to access information about people it’s interested in targeting. It has already tried to take this path to acquire data on folks who track ICE in their local communities. Generally, targeted organizations do not have to notify individuals that their information is being sought by the federal government. However, these groups are not actually obliged to comply with these subpoenas absent judicial action. As Michelle Lapointe, legal director at American Immigration Council, told Slate, administrative subpoenas are not self-enforcing. “When people receive an administrative subpoena from ICE, technically they don’t have to respond,” she said. “The agency can go to court and seek the records to be compelled from the individual who is served with the subpoena. But it has to do that extra step to make it enforceable.”

Lapointe noted that oftentimes recipients of these subpoenas do end up complying out of fear, which DHS appears to be manipulating. The Post story, for instance, described what happened to the U.S. citizen who had emailed the federal prosecutor: Federal agents showed up at his doorstep after he failed to comply with an administrative subpoena. The agents questioned him about the email, asking how he had found the attorney’s email address—through a basic Google search. After about 20 minutes, the agents left.

Critically, tech companies, including Google and Meta, have received administration subpoenas since Trump took office last year, but it’s not always clear when they comply. A Google spokesperson told TechCrunch that it pushes back against overbroad or improper subpoenas, while spokespeople for Meta, Microsoft, Amazon, Apple, and Snap told the Post their companies alert users about administrative subpoena requests unless they are barred from doing so or face extenuating circumstances.

In a case about six separate Instagram accounts that named and shamed a Border Patrol agent who was part of the Los Angeles immigration raids last summer, DHS sent Meta an administrative subpoena asking for the accounts’ names, email addresses, and phone numbers. In that instance, the Instagram account users were made aware of the subpoena, and a judge ordered Meta not to comply.

The issue here is that Americans are left to simply hope these tech companies operate in good faith and out of the goodness of their hearts, something that “should be alarming to all of us,” Lapointe noted. The threat remains that these companies may end up complying with DHS requests in order to get the administration off their backs, even when subpoenas are unwarranted. “I do think the acquiescence of tech and government makes it especially difficult as a functional matter to protect individual rights when you have administrative subpoena authority,” Dennis Fan, an associate professor at Columbia Law School and a former federal prosecutor, told Slate. Attending a protest is a constitutionally protected right, as is writing an email that contains your political opinions, but the Trump administration is finding ways to use these actions against its citizens by leaning into third parties—aka Big Tech—who have access to your personal, identifying information. These are companies that have positioned themselves as friendly partners of the White House, given that many of the country’s tech billionaires personally donated to Trump’s inauguration, then were conspicuously seated in the front row.

Where does that leave the average American? The answer is complicated. Lapointe believes that the best thing we can do is remain aware of our constitutional rights and not let Big Tech get away with selling out Americans without a fight. “I think pressure can be brought to bear, the more we raise awareness that these requests could come through and that the tech companies might receive them, requesting your information,” Lapointe said. “Using public pressure campaigns to encourage them to resist these attempts to get at private information could be helpful.”

So if you exercise your First Amendment right to protest injustices you believe your government is committing, you risk being targeted by that very government. And if you don’t want Big Tech helping that government target you? You may have to be right back at that protest again.

In his most recent rant about how Democrats cheat to win elections, President Donald Trump offered a chilling recommendation on Monday. Appearing on the podcast of Dan Bongino, his former deputy FBI director, the president argued that “the Republicans should say, ‘We want to take over.’ We should take over the voting, the voting in at least many—15 places.

“The Republicans,” he added, “ought to nationalize the voting.”

A federal-government takeover of America’s locally and state-administered voting process has long been something Republicans have opposed on principle. But then again, Trump said he wanted to do it. So how would Senate Republicans respond?

There were those who, in a ritual dating back to the early days of Trump’s first term, had conveniently not kept abreast of the news. Texas Sen. Ted Cruz told me he wouldn’t comment because he hadn’t seen the interview. Iowa Sen. Chuck Grassley thought about it for a few seconds before determining that he too was unfamiliar.

Others were more forthcoming, with Sens. Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski rejecting the idea. Senate Majority Leader John Thune, most importantly, said, “I’m not in favor of federalizing elections—I mean, I think that’s a constitutional issue.”

But a broad middle of GOP senators took something of a third way: While they wouldn’t endorse a partisan and national takeover of voting itself, they were eager to talk about legislation that would greatly expand the federal role in elections—and do so in a way that furthers a long-standing partisan goal of the GOP.

“We need to safeguard our elections better,” Kansas Sen. Roger Marshall told me. “I think the SAVE Act is a great start. I think requiring proof of citizenship when you register to vote is a must.”

Wisconsin Sen. Ron Johnson said that “we shouldn’t nationalize” elections, “but we should certainly set certain standards like citizenship and voter ID.” He added, “The problem is, we have Democrats who want to make it easy to cheat.”

Florida Sen. Rick Scott echoed those sentiments. “We need to have voter ID in our elections. We need to make sure illegal aliens cannot vote in our elections,” he said. “We need to make sure that we just stop the fraud.”

As Marshall alluded to, the bill that Republicans have coalesced around is the Safeguard American Voter Eligibility (SAVE) Act, which the House passed earlier this Congress, and which proponents are trying to find some magical way to squeeze through the Senate’s brick wall.

Even White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt, in a Tuesday press briefing, said passage of this legislation is what Trump had been referring to when he called to “nationalize the voting.” Sure it was.

Republicans often point to the high public support for requiring photo ID at polling places. The SAVE Act is more than that, though. It requires “documentary proof of United States citizenship” in order to register to vote. Such proof means things like a passport or a birth certificate. REAL IDs could count too, but only if they indicate citizenship, and just a handful of states’ REAL IDs currently do so. The SAVE Act, in other words, applies drastic changes to solve a problem—voter fraud—that is vanishingly rare, though it would succeed in creating hurdles for eligible voters. It goes without saying that Democrats have no interest in this legislation, and Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer has described it as “nothing more than Jim Crow 2.0.”

Given Senate Democrats’ 100 percent chance of filibustering this legislation, and Republicans’ inability to eliminate the legislative filibuster, then, what’s the plan for getting this bill through the Senate?

House Republicans think they have an idea that could work. Bless their hearts.

After the Senate and White House reached a deal last week to extend the Department of Homeland Security’s funding for only two weeks, giving them a brief window to negotiate new immigration enforcement reforms, conservative House Republicans were displeased. If Democrats felt as if they could reopen a closed negotiation over DHS funding, then they wanted to participate too. A group of them, led by Florida Rep. Anna Paulina Luna, insisted that when the Senate deal returned to the House, they wouldn’t support it unless they could attach the SAVE Act.

But such a move would have been a recipe for a prolonged shutdown. Trump’s priority over the past week has been to avoid a lengthy shutdown that keeps the issue of immigration enforcement tactics front and center in the news. And so, following a White House meeting, Luna and Co. said they’d received “assurances” from Thune that they would wait out a “standing filibuster” from their Democratic counterparts in order to pass the SAVE Act, at a later date. In return, the rebels would support the government funding bill sent over from the Senate.

Anyone familiar with the Senate realizes that Thune would never have made such an assurance. As Thune clarified Tuesday morning, all he said was that he’d have a conversation with Republican senators about it. You have to know what waiting out a “standing filibuster” means—and most House members don’t—to understand why he wouldn’t promise it to some aggravated House members.

Waiting out a “standing,” or “talking,” filibuster means you wait for the other side to stop talking before moving ahead to a simple-majority vote, as opposed to the normal means of cutting off debate: invoking cloture with 60 votes. The strategy, if used, would likely involve enforcing the Senate’s two-speech rule, barring lawmakers from speaking more than twice in the same legislative day on the same question.

The problem is that this can take forever. Forty-seven Democratic senators being able to speak twice, on its own terms, could take up weeks or months of precious legislative floor time that Republicans need for other priorities. And that’s before any amendments that could reset the clock. Plus, GOP senators would need to be on or near the floor for the entirety of this time to ensure they have a quorum lest Democratic speakers attempt a quorum call.

“I’m skeptical that it’s going to be a panacea,” Texas Sen. John Cornyn, a onetime member of leadership who’s well familiar with Senate rules, told me.

Thune laid out all of these challenges Tuesday afternoon but nevertheless promised to “have a discussion about it and see where our conference is.” In other words, the plan is to allow the passage of time to do the humble work of making everyone forget about all of this.

Trump’s desire for greater control over the administration of the midterm elections, however, won’t disappear amid congressional gridlock. The president already initiated a national redistricting war to squeeze out a few more congressional seats. The FBI has already raided a Georgia election facility and could plan for more. The Justice Department keeps trying to get its mitts on state voter rolls. We don’t know exactly what it is yet, but if there’s a way to do “nationalization” by other means, the administration will be looking into it.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">David Enrich’s whole life right now is the Epstein files. As an investigations editor at the New York Times, his phone and computer basically explode whenever new files are released.Last Friday, his phone exploded again when the Department of Justice dropped about 3 million pages of documents into the cloud.

Back in November, Democrats and Republicans worked together to force the DOJ to release all they’d discovered about Jeffrey Epstein—the country’s most notorious sex criminal and probably one of the richest, too. With this latest release, the DOJ says it has satisfied that demand. But it’s not even all they’ve got.

The Times built its own internal search engine to sort through the sludge. It doesn’t just search for specific words; you can ask it to search for concepts like bribery. And these documents aren’t just emails about President Donald Trump, or giddy vacation planning for rich folks hoping to hop a ride to Epstein’s infamous island. There are photos and videos, even bank records.

On a recent episode of What Next, host Mary Harris spoke to Enrich about the latest Epstein file drop and what it says about Bill Gates, Elon Musk, and Donald Trump. This transcript has been edited and condensed for clarity.

Mary Harris: Before we dig into exactly what’s in the file and what it says, what does the sheer volume of what’s been released tell you?

David Enrich: I don’t have much confidence in the government. I don’t have much sense that the majority of this stuff has been read thoroughly.

When these files were released, a number of things seemed to have been released by mistake. The implication of that is that they didn’t know exactly what they were releasing. But it’s also really awful stuff. Pictures of women and young girls without any kind of redaction. They’re identifiable, nude. Very upsetting, essentially. And your team was part of the team that found that, right?

This has been a real mess by the government. The argument they make is that they only had two months to pull this stuff together because the Epstein Files Transparency Act was passed and signed into law in November, with a December deadline. But the truth is that Trump came into office saying he was going to be transparent about this and release the files, and they made a series of choices and decisions not to do that, which I think were based in part on their gradual understanding of the fact that what was in these may be damaging to Trump or his allies.

So they then entered this frenzied period, starting in November, and did not do a good job. There are a huge number of things in there that are identifying victims, a number of files that have a high likelihood of being child sexual abuse material, and all sorts of other damaging stuff that serves no public interest and was not, in fact, required by law to be disclosed. What they’ve done is all these haphazard redactions, redacting a bunch of things they’re not supposed to redact. We found that Steve Bannon had texted Epstein, and Epstein’s name was redacted, and Trump’s face was redacted. And it’s like, why on earth would that stuff be redacted? At the same time, we’re seeing victims’ names identified.

The government is being somewhat responsive now when things are being brought to their attention. They’re taking them down and are re-redacting them. But at the same time, they appear to have overredacted quite a bit of stuff.

What stands out to me in this possible final release of files is the way that neither Donald Trump nor Jeffrey Epstein seem to be able to escape each other. These are two people who were friends in the 1990s and early 2000s. There are reports that there was a falling-out between them. Epstein gets arrested for sex acts with a minor. Donald Trump decides to run for president. But these guys can’t stop talking about each other.

Yeah, they were very close for a while, but Epstein’s defining human trait was an ability to seize on his connections and leverage them for as much currency as he could. And that came in many forms, right? That’s why he had all these pictures of himself with famous people in his houses, because he liked to be able to show those off to other famous people, or to use these as a threat hanging over the heads of his victims.

With Trump, it’s playing out in some different ways. Part of it is that with Trump’s rise to power back in 2016, Epstein realized that here was someone who had great power to either make Epstein’s life better or worse. And so I think he was really trying to suss out, initially, how he could pull those different levers. It obviously didn’t work very well, since during Trump’s first term, Epstein ended up in prison and then died.

And the files were kind of a useful tool for Trump and Trump’s allies, in particular, to beat Democrats and fan the flames of conspiracy theories on the far right. There’s no doubt that one of the things that got Trump elected in 2024 was this band of far-right MAGA people who were convinced that Trump was going to expose this global ring of pedophiles on the left and through the Epstein files.

The big allegation about Trump in these latest files involves calls to the FBI’s tip line. And these are a little dicey to talk about, because these are unverified tips. The FBI gets all kinds of unverified tips all the time. But could you just lay out what’s in there?

I’m going to be like a really anal New York Times reporter. We’ve made a decision institutionally that we’re not going to give airtime to things that we really just have no idea if they are true or not, especially when they’re of this lurid nature. But I mean, in general, it’s just very lurid sexual allegations involving Trump in the context of his relationship with Epstein. And they’re very bad allegations.

Let’s talk about some of the other big names that have been in the spotlight since the latest release. My understanding is that in these files, you see Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick trying to make plans to go to Epstein’s island. He was in friendly contact with Jeffrey Epstein long after he said he’d shut the relationship down.

Yeah, and the crazy thing here is that Lutnik just last year had said not only that he had shut the relationship down, but he had given this whole explanation for why he’d shut it down, which was that he’d visited Epstein’s mansion and he’d seen stuff in there that made him and his wife really uncomfortable. And they had vowed then and there to never associate with this terrible man again. But what we see in these files shows that’s just not true at all. They by all accounts had a pretty chummy relationship. They visited Epstein on his island long after this alleged encounter in the townhouse that left them so unsettled.

There’s also Bill Gates, founder of Microsoft. There have been allegations for years that Gates and Jeffrey Epstein were close. But in this latest release of documents, there are these implications that Epstein was helping procure women for Bill Gates and that Gates got a sexually transmitted infection, and was trying to get drugs to treat himself and secretly treat his own wife. She’s been asked about this, and she’s given an answer basically saying, This takes me back to the worst times of my marriage, which isn’t a, like, Hell no, this didn’t happen. It’s something quite different.

We’ve known for years, since Epstein’s death, about the long-running relationship between Gates and Epstein that involved everything, apparently, from science to money to women, or girls perhaps. I can’t say I’m shocked to see Gates’ reentry into this. The thing I’ll caution about here is—and I’m not at all defending Gates or his apparent conduct, and it is entirely possible that those emails were true and accurately reflected what Epstein and people like Gates did—but it is possible that Epstein is a liar and an embellisher and an expert in using threats and leverage to get what he wants with powerful people. And so it is not outside the realm of possibility that Epstein was exaggerating or twisting the truth. That being said, we know, and this has been out there in public for a while, that part of the reason that Bill and Melinda Gates got divorced was her discomfort with her husband’s relationship with Epstein. And while we’ve never really had the full gory details and what that’s entailed, it’s obviously been a subject of informed speculation.

Elon Musk is in here. He’s writing to Jeffrey Epstein asking, When is the wildest party on your island, because I want to make sure that I come. What do you make of this?

Once again, we are seeing people who had previously denied or downplayed their relationships with Epstein, and in fact had pointed at other people for being more connected to Epstein, we are now seeing that they, long after Epstein was known as a sexual criminal and had registered as a Level 3 sex offender, were continuing to associate with him.

You’ve talked about transparency being important here. Can we talk about what we’re not seeing in this release of documents? We were promised 6 million documents. I thought they were legally required to release all the files, so what is happening there?

That is a good question, and I don’t have a good answer. What the Justice Department has said is that they withheld a large quantity of documents to protect victims’ identities.Two things can be true: They can be protecting victims’ identities by not releasing 3 million documents and they can also be doing a bad job of protecting victims’ identities in the 3 million pages of documents that they did release. That being said, this administration’s handling of the Epstein files doesn’t have a whole lot of credibility.

A year ago, Attorney General Pam Bondi and FBI Director Kash Patel said they released the Epstein files by handing binders full of public court documents to a group of MAGA influencers. That was the whole start of this. And it’s gone along on the same trajectory with deceitful disclosures. In that context, I think it is normal and reasonable for open-minded people to be skeptical and curious about what’s actually in these other 3 million pages of documents.

To get to this point, Congress had to act of its own accord, essentially, and force the release. Are there other avenues available to lawmakers who want to see more here?

The Justice Department has said it is going to meet with lawmakers to explain its thinking. The other options are not necessarily in terms of getting these files, but there are other ways to get some more transparency. And one of the things we’ve seen is that the House Oversight Committee has issued a bunch of subpoenas to a wide variety of people demanding that they sit for depositions under oath, the transcripts of which will presumably be released in short order. And that ranges from people like the Clintons to people like former Victoria Secret CEO Les Wexner, who was one of Epstein’s biggest financial benefactors over the years. We’ll see what happens.

There are a huge number of wealthy, powerful individuals all over the world who continued to associate with Epstein and provide him with various kinds of support long after he went to jail.To me, what has made the Epstein story so riveting and so important for so many years is that yes, this is a story about a guy who is a pedophile and was doing terrible things to women and girls. But much more than that, it is a story about how one individual, when he accrues enough wealth and influence and connections, can work the entire global system to his benefit for very nefarious purposes. And he does it in conjunction and in some cases partnership with some of the richest, most powerful people on Earth. And that is a story that has not yet fully been told.

Just when it seemed that things couldn’t get any stranger, the Trump administration has injected abortion law into its efforts to stamp out anti-ICE protests. Last week, Don Lemon, an independent reporter, and two protesters were arrested on federal charges arising out of an anti–Immigration and Customs Enforcement protest at a Minnesota church. One of the key charges involves the Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances Act, legislation passed in 1993 to protect access to reproductive health facilities and places of worship. Understanding the law’s past and present reveals how the Department of Justice has repurposed it to crack down on protest that the president opposes.

The FACE Act passed at a time of escalating anti-abortion protest. Abortion opponents had watched as Republican presidents reshaped the U.S. Supreme Court, but abortion remained legal. Frustrations spilled over, and a growing number of Americans joined clinic blockades led by Operation Rescue, a group that sought to shut down abortion clinics. As Time magazine reported, the primary tactic Operation Rescue used was “to jam all entrances to an abortion clinic before the police can muster sufficient officers to begin arrests.”

Operation Rescue members did get arrested but often faced minor charges, like trespassing, before quickly returning to the protest front lines. Most of those who attended these protests were peaceful—Operation Rescue instructed recruits on what it called nonviolent civil disobedience. But the group’s message was that lawbreaking was justified in the name of saving the lives of the unborn.

That message was hard to contain, and by 1993, anti-abortion extremists were arguing that it was legitimate to use violence against providers. That year saw the first of a series of murders of abortion doctors. Congress responded with the FACE Act, which sought to distinguish peaceful protest and speech (much of which is protected under the First Amendment) from violence, threats of force, and efforts to obstruct access to clinics. Sponsored by Democrat Ted Kennedy and Republican Constance Morella, the law drew inspiration partly from a federal law already protecting “interference with rights,” including religious exercise.

The addition of places of worship was meant to doom passage of the act at a time when Democrats controlled both houses of Congress; a staffer for Utah Sen. Orrin Hatch (the now-prominent conservative Ed Whelan) added the language as a poison pill. There was also a plan to mock the bill if it passed: Whelan hoped that the addition would change the acronym for the law to the FARCE Act.

But Kennedy was in favor of the addition in no small part because of the historic victimization of Black churches, synagogues, and other places of worship—a trend that was all too evident in several mass shootings last year. If anything, the tactic cemented the bill’s bipartisan appeal: Seventeen Republican senators and three members of the House ultimately supported it.

Abortion opponents immediately challenged the law’s constitutionality under the First Amendment, arguing that the statute censored speech and singled out abortion foes for prosecution. The courts rejected that argument by stressing that the FACE Act was narrow: It applied only to conduct and was enforced regardless of what message protesters intended to convey. Constitutional arguments against the act have reemerged since the demise of Roe v. Wade, with the CATO Institute arguing that there may no longer be any congressional authority for the law and that it may thus be unconstitutional.

The FACE Act had a major impact on the clinic blockade movement, which relied on a large number of recruits to stop patients from entering abortion clinics. Rather than minor trespassing charges, protesters now weighed the prospect of serious fines and prison time, with penalties escalating for repeat offenders.

But the line between speech and obstruction, threats, or violence can sometimes be messy to draw in context. That meant that federal prosecutors were often reluctant to bring FACE Act charges, even when Democrats were in office. With Joe Biden in the White House, federal prosecutors did file charges against not only anti-abortion groups like Red Rose Rescue (a next-generation clinic blockade group) but also Jane’s Revenge, a militant abortion-rights group that carried out a campaign of vandalism, arson, and bombing.

Fast-forward to 2026, when the FACE Act is enjoying a bizarre renaissance. Over the years, bipartisan consensus about the legislation collapsed, and conservative Republicans began calling for its repeal. Then, in January 2025, a spokesperson for the Trump administration announced that the White House would no longer enforce the FACE Act absent “extraordinary circumstances” or “significant aggravating factors.” Abortion opponents clearly see this announcement as an opportunity. Randall Terry, the 66-year-old founder of Operation Rescue, is working with his girlfriend, Terrisa Bukovinac, the 44-year-old leader of a group called Progressive Anti-Abortion Uprising, to launch a new wave of protests and reach a younger generation of potential recruits.*

But “extraordinary circumstances” might not be as hard for the administration to find when the president doesn’t like what protesters are saying. The White House has turned its FACE Act focus toward language protecting places of worship from those who interfere with religious exercise “by force or threat of force or physical obstruction” to target messages that the administration opposes.

First came an indictment against a group of pro-Palestinian protesters and organizations arising from a November 2024 demonstration outside a New Jersey synagogue. Organized by the Party for Socialism and Liberation in New Jersey and American Muslims for Palestine New Jersey, the protest targeted an event promoting the sale of property in Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank. What happened next is unclear, but violence broke out between the protesters and pro-Israel counterprotesters. New Jersey prosecutors concluded that pro-Israel demonstrators were the first to cross the line into violence, and the Department of Justice disagreed. Either way, it seemed to be a strange choice for an administration that had announced a lack of interest in enforcing the FACE Act to prioritize a case in which local law enforcement saw the facts so differently.

Now the administration is pursuing similar charges against Don Lemon. The former CNN anchor and his co-defendants faced charges based on an anti-ICE protest at Cities Church, a site that was chosen because protesters believed its pastor to be the acting director of a local ICE field office. At the time, 3,000 ICE agents had flooded the Twin Cities, and Renee Good had recently been shot and killed by federal immigration officials. Alex Pretti would be killed later in the ICE surge.

Prosecutors claim that Lemon, a noted critic of the president, helped organize the Cities Church protest, which they frame as an attack. The indictment charges that Lemon then obstructed church members from leaving by posting himself at the door and asking them questions.

Based on the available evidence, it’s hard to see these charges as anything but disturbing and wrong. Video of the incident shows heated exchanges between Lemon and his interview subjects, who clearly disagree with him about immigration policy and the conduct of ICE in the Twin Cities. There are moments when the journalist is asked to leave, or when the people to whom he’s speaking clearly want to move on. And people do leave, including the ones Lemon seems to aggravate the most. The video doesn’t show much more physical contact than Lemon pushing his microphone into the subjects’ faces. If that act qualifies as physical obstruction, it’s hard to see what kind of press scrum would not.

Drawing the line between protected speech and obstruction or threats isn’t always straightforward. And even when the line is clear, protests about everything from ICE to abortion often involve civil disobedience like trespassing. Those protests can involve speech that is rude, unconvincing, or even hateful. But the line between protected speech and wrongful conduct can’t depend on the reasons people are protesting. With this latest prosecution, that’s just the danger we face.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Newsletter platform Substack has admitted that an intruder swiped user contact details months before the company noticed, forcing it to warn writers and readers that their email addresses and other account metadata were accessed without permission.

The disclosure arrived in an email this week from Substack CEO Chris Best to affected users, who acknowledged the lapse in unusually no-frills language. &quot;I&#39;m reaching out to let you know about a security incident that resulted in the email address from your Substack account being shared without your permission,&quot; Best said in the message, seen by The Register. &quot;This sucks. I&#39;m sorry. We will work very hard to make sure it does not happen again.&quot;

According to the company, an &quot;unauthorized third party&quot; accessed limited user data during October 2025. The incident was not detected until February 3, when Substack reported that it had uncovered evidence that its systems had been compromised. The exposed information includes email addresses, phone numbers, and internal account metadata. Substack maintains that passwords, credit card numbers, and financial data were not touched.

The company says that it has since patched the vulnerability that allowed access and has launched a full internal investigation. It also claims there is currently no evidence that the stolen data is being actively misused, though it is urging users to remain alert for suspicious emails or phishing attempts.

Substack&#39;s confirmation comes after a threat actor posted a dataset they said had been stolen from the platform. A post on a cybercrime forum advertised nearly 700,000 alleged user records, including names, email addresses, phone numbers, user IDs, and profile images.

It&#39;s still unclear whether the trove of data circulating online is connected to the breach Substack has acknowledged. The company did not respond to questions from The Register asking how many users might be affected, what categories of data may have been exposed, or whether the October intrusion matches the information that later surfaced publicly.

The breach could prove particularly damaging for Substack, whose business depends on trust between writers and subscribers. Mailing lists sit at the core of that model, and if compromised, they could provide scammers with a ready-made catalogue of highly engaged readers. ®

            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2026/02/05/asia_government_spies_hacked_37_critical_networks/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">A state-aligned cyber group in Asia compromised government and critical infrastructure organizations across 37 countries in an ongoing espionage campaign, according to security researchers.

In total, the crew compromised at least 70 organizations, and maintained access to several of these for months.

&quot;While this group might be pursuing espionage objectives, its methods, targets and scale of operations are alarming, with potential long-term consequences for national security and key services,&quot; Palo Alto Networks&#39; Unit 42 cyber sleuths said in research published on Wednesday.

Successful break-ins included five national police or border control entities, one nation&#39;s parliament, a senior elected official, and national telecommunications companies. The spies also broke into systems belonging to three ministries of finance and other government agencies.

&quot;Palo Alto Networks Unit 42 confirmed that the threat actor successfully accessed and exfiltrated sensitive data from victim email servers,&quot; Unit 42 Director of National Security Programs Pete Renals told The Register. &quot;This included financial negotiations and contracts, banking and account information, and critical military-related operational updates.&quot;

Renals said the cyber investigation team is not attributing the digital intrusions to a specific Asian country.

The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency is aware of the hacking group identified as TGR-STA-1030 by Palo Alto Networks

Unit 42 tracks the new group as TGR-STA-1030, and said they also observed the spies conducting &quot;active reconnaissance&quot; against 155 governments across the Americas, Europe, Asia, and Africa between November and December 2025. The researchers also documented a &quot;concerted focus&quot; on Germany in July 2025, during which the snoops initiated connections to over 490 IP addresses hosting government infrastructure.

While Renals declined to provide details about specific reconnaissance targets in the US, &quot;more broadly across the board, we saw the actor routinely focus on ministries of finance, economy, defense, foreign affairs and commerce,&quot; he said.

The FBI did not respond to our requests for comment, but the US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) confirmed that it is also tracking this cyber-espionage crew.

&quot;The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency is aware of the hacking group identified as TGR-STA-1030 by Palo Alto Networks,&quot; a CISA spokesperson told The Register. &quot;We are working with our government, industry, and international partners to rapidly detect and mitigate any exploitation of the vulnerabilities identified in the report.&quot;

The cyberspies use phishing emails and known vulnerabilities in Microsoft Exchange, SAP, and Atlassian products to gain initial access to victim organizations.

In February 2025, Unit 42 spotted phishing campaigns targeting European governments and using lures related to ministry or department reorganization that included links to malicious files hosted on mega[.]nz. The threat hunters note that one Estonian government entity also observed this campaign and uploaded a related ZIP archive to VirusTotal&#39;s malware repository.

The Estonian filename translates to &quot;Changes to the organizational structure of the Police and Border Guard Board.&quot;

Unit 42 analyzed the archive&#39;s contents and found it contained a malware loader with the original name &quot;DiaoYu.exe.&quot; This translates to fishing - or phishing in this context. While most loaders check for dozens of antivirus products, this one only checks for five: Kaspersky, Avira, Bitdefender, SentinelOne, and Symantec.

This gives the malware a minimal code footprint and could be a means to help it avoid being detected by security filters.

The investigation also uncovered a new Linux kernel rootkit called ShadowGuard, believed to be unique to this particular nation-state group. It&#39;s a stealthy Extended Berkeley Packet Filter (eBPF) backdoor that hides process information, directories, and files at the kernel level, which makes it very difficult to detect.

TGR-STA-1030 also used real-world geopolitical events in its campaigns, including the US government shutdown that began in October 2025 - during which Unit 42 observed the spies scanning government infrastructure across North, Central, and South America.

In another case, the researchers say in August 2025, Czech President Petr Pavel privately met with the Dalai Lama during a trip to India, and in the following weeks, the snoop crew began scanning Czech infrastructure across the army, police, parliament, and ministries of interior, finance, and foreign affairs.

Additionally, soon after January 3, when an American military operation captured Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro and his wife, the snoops conducted &quot;extensive reconnaissance activities targeting at least 140 government-owned IP addresses,&quot; according to Unit 42.

This new nation-state group &quot;remains an active threat to government and critical infrastructure worldwide,&quot; the researchers said. ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">US lawmakers have asked NASA to look into storing the International Space Station (ISS) in a higher orbit at the end of its operational life, instead of sending the structure hurtling into the ocean when the time comes.

The question came up during the markup of the NASA Reauthorization Act and raises an intriguing possibility. Could the multi-billion-dollar complex be sent to a higher orbit where future generations might find a use for it, rather than destroyed?

To be clear, the amendment offered by Reps. Whitesides (D-CA) and Begich (R-AK) and passed by voice vote was not about changing the plan to end ISS operations in 2030, but instead asked whether the ISS could be stored in a higher, stable orbit once it reached the end of its useful life.

Whitesides explained that the amendment required NASA to conduct an analysis of the costs and risks of storing the ISS in orbit. It did not mandate relocation, nor did it authorize funding or the execution of any such plan.

It is, however, worth pondering as the ISS nears the end of its life. In 2024, SpaceX was awarded the contract to build a vehicle to de-orbit the ISS. The vehicle is expected to be ready by 2029, ahead of a planned push to send the ISS into the Earth&#39;s atmosphere.

But the alternative is is intriguing: It is technically possible to boost the orbit, though it would require building a vehicle to do so. The bigger question is whether doing so is worth the risks involved.

Whitesides acknowledged some of those risks in the amendment. The ISS is aging and could shed components in the future, posing a potential debris risk. There is also the possibility of a future uncontrolled re-entry.

NASA has already performed an evaluation and concluded that the chance of something hitting the ISS would increase as the orbit was raised, from an estimated 51 years between impacts at its current altitude to less than four years at 497 miles. Complete fragmentation could be catastrophic.

It is, however, an interesting thought experiment.

Another markup, introduced and later withdrawn, came from Rep. Don Beyer (D-VA) regarding the controversial requirement to relocate a space vehicle to Houston. NASA is widely expected to move Space Shuttle Discovery from its current resting place at the Smithsonian Museum to a facility in Texas, although it&#39;s not confirmed this yet.

Beyer&#39;s markup would have required NASA to inform Congress of the cost &quot;and potential for physical harm&quot; to the space vehicle before kicking off the process.

The markup was withdrawn on the understanding that discussions would be had on the relocation &quot;without damaging the vehicle, preserving the integrity of our assets for generations to come.&quot; ®

            <h2>Anthropic apes OpenAI with cheeky chatbot commercials</h2>
            <p><strong>The Register | 2026-02-05</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2026/02/05/anthropic_superbowl_openai_chatgpt_ads/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">AI companies are looking for new ways of burning cash other than by handing it to hyperscalers for model training. So now they&#39;re setting money on fire by buying Super Bowl ads that mock rivals.

Anthropic, everyone&#39;s favorite AI company that doesn&#39;t make ChatGPT, has decided that its Claude AI model family will remain free of advertising, unlike rival OpenAI, and wants everyone to know about it.

By letting &quot;everyone&quot; know, we mean everyone who chooses to watch the Super Bowl, as the firm plans to run a pair of TV commercials during this Sunday&#39;s game, according to the Associated Press.

Anthropic has actually created four of the commercials, each a minute long, all of which follow the same pattern: a user asks a chatbot for advice concerning some aspect of their life. The chatbot, represented by a real person speaking in a somewhat unnatural manner, gives encouraging and supportive advice at first, before abruptly switching to promote a product related to the conversation.

According to some sources, the TV networks have been flogging 30-second ad slots for prices exceeding $10 million this year, which means Anthropic could be coughing up $20 million for each minute-long commercial it runs.

That&#39;s equivalent to the company sacrificing about six of Nvidia&#39;s hulking DGX GB200 NVL72 rack scale AI systems or a lot of runtime on AWS for a jokey commercial, according to our reckoning, so they had better be funny.

Unfortunately, they aren&#39;t that funny, just mildly amusing, but OpenAI chief Sam Altman claims they made him laugh.

In a riposte posted on X, Altman described the commercials as funny, but dishonest.

&quot;Our most important principle for ads says that we won&#39;t do exactly this; we would obviously never run ads in the way Anthropic depicts them. We are not stupid and we know our users would reject that,&quot; he says - we imagine through gritted teeth.

Altman then has a pop at Anthropic in return, claiming that the biz “wants to control what people do with AI by blocking companies it doesn’t like from using its coding product” and wants to “write the rules itself for what people can and can’t use AI for,” contrasting that with OpenAI’s approach, naturally.

This unseemly spat could be partly down to Anthropic being founded in 2021 by former members of OpenAI, including, we should disclose, Jack Clark, formerly of this parish.

Anthropic appears to be trying to position itself as the plucky underdog, nipping at the heels of the tech giants, but it too has major backers, including Amazon and Google, which have committed billions in funding and partnerships to the AI developer.

Perhaps we can look forward to the day when the AI bubble finally pops and we don&#39;t have to hear any more from Silicon Valley AI firms and their crazy circular investment schemes. Altman himself admitted we&#39;re in the midst of an AI bubble last year. ®

SpaceX applied for permission to launch as many as one million satellites for its proposed orbital datacenter constellation on January 30, and the FCC&#39;s Space Bureau has already accepted [PDF] the application for filing just five days later, though perhaps just so it can collect enough public comments to shoot the ridiculous idea down before it gets beyond the Muskian brainstorm stage (we inquired, but didn&#39;t hear back).

According to Harvard astrophysicist and space object cataloger Jonathan McDowell, there are a paltry 14,518 active payloads in Earth orbit as of the end of January, 9,555 of them belonging to Starlink. Earth&#39;s orbit is already crowded with fewer than 15,000 active satellites circling the planet, and tens of thousands more tracked objects when defunct spacecraft and debris are included, while large satellite constellations are increasingly interfering with astronomical observations from the ground and from space.

Increase the number of active satellites by nearly 6,800 percent and the risk of Kessler Syndrome - a situation where Earth orbit becomes so crowded a chain reaction of collisions creates so much space debris that portions of Earth orbit become unusable - starts to look quaint.

&quot;One million satellites are going to be a big challenge for astronomy, especially as they are in higher orbits which is worse for us,&quot; McDowell told The Register by email when asked about Musk&#39;s orbital datacenter plan. SpaceX&#39;s application [PDF] to the FCC calls for its datacenter constellation to be in multiple orbital shells in altitudes between 500 km (310 miles) and 2,000 km (1,242 miles).

&quot;I think a constellation like this will absolutely be required to have a fleet of tow-truck satellites to remove failed ones to avoid Kessler,&quot; McDowell added. Companies like Astroscale are developing such satellites, McDowell said. He also noted that the Chinese have demonstrated satellites with such capabilities.

As of last October, Starlink was estimated to be deorbiting and burning up roughly one to two satellites a day, which McDowell told us at the time could be a serious problem for the planet&#39;s health. Those concerns have yet to be resolved, McDowell told us in our most recent conversation.

Musk said in a Monday blog post announcing SpaceX&#39;s acquisition of xAI (and, by extension, financially-troubled post-Twitter social media platform X) that the 1M satellite orbital datacenter constellation is part of his bizarre dream to scale SpaceX to &quot;make a sentient sun to understand the Universe,&quot; and while that sci-fi dream didn&#39;t make it into the FCC filings, one of Musk&#39;s other delusions did.

&quot;Launching a constellation of a million satellites that operate as orbital data centers is a first step towards becoming a Kardashev II-level civilization,&quot; SpaceX said in its filing.

Kardashev II-level civilizations are able to harness the full power of their star, often theorized to be achieved by a Dyson sphere that completely envelopes a star at a habitable orbit.

In order to become a Kardashev Type I–level society, Earth would need to harness most of the energy available on the planet, a theoretical milestone often cited in discussions of long-term technological growth, before leaping to a Type II civilization capable of exploiting stellar-scale power.

Given that this is one of Musk&#39;s fever dreams, concrete technical details of the satellite constellation remain sparse. SpaceX only noted in its filing that the satellites would rely on &quot;high-bandwidth optical links&quot; and claims the system could deliver on the order of 100 kW of power per metric ton allocated to computing, with traffic routed through SpaceX&#39;s Starlink network for transmission to authorized ground stations.

Also featuring prominently in the FCC application is SpaceX&#39;s struggling Starship super rocket, which has yet to do much more than occasionally perform a test flight between mishaps.

&quot;With Starship&#39;s ability to deliver unprecedented tonnage to orbit for AI compute, the capacity for intelligence processing in space could surpass the electricity consumption of the entire U.S. economy,&quot; SpaceX said in its application, describing the craft as bringing &quot;inherent efficiencies&quot; to its ability to launch the constellation via Starship and scale it as demand requires.

In classic Musk fashion, there&#39;s a lot in this proposal riding on assumptions and technology that doesn&#39;t appear to actually exist yet.

&quot;I think it&#39;s unclear at this stage whether it&#39;s feasible or not - but SpaceX seem to think it is,&quot; McDowell told us.

It could all be a pipe dream, or it could be a sign that Earth&#39;s orbit is about to get a lot more crowded and hazardous. The FCC is now soliciting public comments on SpaceX&#39;s application with a deadline of March 6.

SpaceX didn&#39;t respond to questions for this story. ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Nearly 60 percent of SAP migration projects are delayed and over budget as organizations underestimate complexity, allow expansion of scope, and fail to understand internal constraints, according to research from ISG.

The survey of 200 senior decision-makers in large global companies also found that fewer than one in five organizations reimplement SAP processes and technology when they move to the latest platform, S/4HANA.

Nearly half (49 percent) carry out little or no re-engineering, choosing instead to preserve legacy processes and data.

The research comes as SAP users face the support deadline for ECC, the legacy ERP platform still used by thousands of the world&#39;s largest businesses. By the end of 2027, mainstream support is stopping while extended support at a 2 percent premium will be available until the end of 2030. SAP has also discussed another support option beyond 2030 so long as customers sign up to its migration commercials ahead of that date.

Gartner data shows 39 percent of SAP&#39;s 35,000 ECC customers worldwide had yet to migrate as of Q4 2024, nearly a decade after S/4HANA launched in 2015.

Yet the majority of the largest organizations are still failing to stick to budgets and timelines with migration to S/4HANA.

Michael Dornan, ISG principal analyst, said even simply moving their current processes to a new platform, organizations struggled with making a plan and sticking to it.

&quot;Some of them are trying to do this quickly, a lift-and-shift as fast and cheap as possible. This group often underestimated the complexity, scope and the constraints they have. They also suffer from scope creep and changing requirements as they go through. A lot of the delays are caused by people, not necessarily the technology.&quot;

According to the research, 34 percent of organizations were opting for &quot;brownfield&quot; migrations. Eighteen percent wanted to adopt a greenfield strategy, embracing standard processes in SAP&#39;s preferred &quot;clean core&quot; approach. Nearly half, however, were mixing the two approaches, so-called &quot;bluefield.&quot; A muddy field, The Register might suggest.

Dornan said more than half the survey respondents agreed they had over-customized legacy ERP to the point where standardization now feels risky to the business.

&quot;That&#39;s the fear they go through. If you standardize, then you just start that whole process again. There are a lot of stakeholders in the business that actually felt that their old ERP was doing the job that they wanted to, which creates inertia,&quot; he said.

The report states that brownfield and hybrid approaches might limit long-term benefits and make it more difficult to adopt newer technologies such as AI.

&quot;Fragmented processes, extensive customizations, and legacy data structures often constrain which AI use cases can be effectively deployed after go-live. By contrast, environments with standardized processes and well-governed data are better positioned to realize the automation, forecasting, and operational efficiency gains enterprises expect.&quot;

However, businesses are carefully weighing up the risks and refusing to be dictated by the vendors&#39; timelines.

Of the total sample of SAP ERP users, eight percent planned to stay on ECC beyond 2027 while around two-thirds were still in the planning stage for migration, making it unlikely they would make the cutoff for mainstream support.

The trend is borne out elsewhere. Airbus, for example, currently runs a patchwork of SAP versions, including legacy SAP R/3 4.6 and ECC 6.0 systems. While some divisions – finance, materials management, and parts of Airbus Helicopters – have already moved to S/4HANA, the bulk of the migration lies ahead. The company told The Register it may not be finished by 2030.

Like thousands of other SAP users, it is trying to find the right balance between the risks of changing and the risks of staying the same. ®

            <div id="article-text">The Meta CEO said Apple seems to get away with less criticism by lying low.

The Meta CEO said Apple seems to get away with less criticism by lying low.

One day after The Wall Street Journal published a blockbuster story about Meta’s own dismal findings about teen girls’ mental health on Instagram, CEO Mark Zuckerberg wondered whether Meta should change how it studies its platforms’ potential harms.

“Recent events have made me consider whether we should change our approach to research and analytics around social issues,” Zuckerberg wrote in a September 15th, 2021, email to top executives including then-COO Sheryl Sandberg and head of global affairs Nick Clegg. The day before, the Journal published a story based on documents obtained from a whistleblower later revealed to be Frances Haugen, which showed the company’s own research had found that “Thirty-two percent of teen girls said that when they felt bad about their bodies, Instagram made them feel worse.” The subject line of Zuckerberg’s email read: “Social issue research and analytics — privileged and confidential.”

The 2021 email was unsealed Thursday after being collected in discovery by New Mexico Attorney General Raúl Torrez as part of a case alleging Meta deceptively positioned its products as safe for teens when it was aware of harmful design choices that the state claims addicted kids and allowed for child predators to thrive. In the complaint, the AG’s office alleged that disclosing harms Meta identified on its platforms “would have corrected the misleading and deceptive nature of its public statements proclaiming its platforms ‘safe.’” Meta spokesperson Andy Stone told The Verge in a statement that the company “is proud of our continued commitment to doing transparent, industry-leading research. As we have for years, we continue to use these insights to make meaningful improvements, like introducing teen accounts with built-in protections and providing parents with tools to manage their teens’ experiences.”

The email is just one example of the kind of internal conversations expected to come to light throughout that trial, and in a series of cases with similar claims in California. Opening statements in the New Mexico case are expected to kick off next week.

In the email, Zuckerberg wrote that it seemed Meta’s peers managed to skirt public criticism on social issues by doing far less proactive research on the harms on their platforms. “Apple, for example, doesn’t seem to study any of this stuff,” he wrote. “As far as I understand, they don’t have anyone reviewing or moderating content and don’t even have a report flow in iMessage. They’ve taken the approach that it is people’s own responsibility what they do on the platform, and by Apple not taking that responsibility upon themselves, they haven’t created a staff or plethora of studies examining the tradeoffs in their approach. This has worked surprisingly well for them.”

“[W]hen Apple did try to do something about CSAM, they were roundly criticized for it”

While Apple seemed to evade critique, in Zuckerberg’s view, Meta instead “faced more criticism” because it reports more child sexual abuse material (CSAM), which “makes it seem like there’s more of that behavior on our platforms.” On the other hand, he noted, “when Apple did try to do something about CSAM, they were roundly criticized for it, which may encourage them to double down on their original approach.” Zuckerberg might have been referring to Apple’s announcement earlier that year of new features meant to protect kids, including scanning users’ iCloud photos for CSAM. But privacy advocates worried the move would create a giant backdoor for surveillance of user accounts. Apple later walked back the proposals. Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the email.

Apple and Meta have long sparred in public and private over their different approaches to policy issues like privacy and age verification. But Zuckerberg also had similar observations of Meta’s other peers. “YouTube, Twitter and Snap take a similar approach, to lesser degrees,” he wrote. “YouTube seems to intentionally bury its head in the sand to stay below the radar and not be the center of attention. Twitter and Snap may just not have the resources to do this kind of research.” Many of the platforms have publicly shared research and initiatives over the years studying the safety of their platforms, including YouTube’s Youth and Families Advisory Committee made up of independent experts to guide teen well-being on the platform, as well as Snap’s Digital Well-Being Index (started in 2022).

“I think we should be commended for the work we do to study, understand, and improve social issues on our platforms.”

Zuckerberg seemed to believe the public response to its internal research was unfair. “I think we should be commended for the work we do to study, understand, and improve social issues on our platforms,” he wrote. “Unfortunately, the media is more likely to use any research or recommendations produced to say we’re not doing everything we can (implying for craven purposes) rather than that we’re taking these issues more seriously than anyone else in our industry by studying them and looking for solutions, not all of which are reasonable to implement because everything has tradeoffs.”

In response to the email, at least a couple top executives endorsed continuing some level of research into social issues, even in spite of the public perception risks. “Leaks suck, and will continue to happen, unless we find a way to eradicate them,” then-VP of central products Javier Olivan wrote. “Given that — is it still worth trying to understand these issues? I think it is the responsible thing to do / I would love for us to continue trying to understand how we can make our products better for everyone, but maybe we should limit the surface to those areas where we at least see some clear degree of correlation between usage of our products / the specific issue.” Then-VP of product, choice, and competition David Ginsberg said that “after a lot of wrestling with this myself the past few days,” he largely agreed with Olivan. “I think the internal work is important for providing a good product and a good user experience — separate and aside from any societal issues goals.”

A few days later, Guy Rosen, a product executive leading integrity work, shared several potential options of how to change the company’s organization around internal and external research, including pros and cons for each. Rosen wrote that this was only a “preliminary/discretional exercise” to understand the “spectrum of options.” Those ranged from centralizing teams that research highly sensitive topics in an effort to better control access to the materials, to the most extreme option of disbanding teams that research sensitive topics and outsourcing that work when needed. Ultimately, executives recommended the less extreme option of centralizing research teams, planning to announce it shortly after Instagram CEO Adam Mosseri’s upcoming congressional testimony. Mosseri, newly added to the email thread, chimed in that “Announcing this after my testify [sic] is worse than before, and we talked [about] this. It will leak, and it will make it look like I was hiding something.” Meta ended up announcing the changes before Mosseri’s testimony, and has said it continues to study sensitive topics like teens’ well-being.

In the initial email, Zuckerberg lamented that leaks of internal documents make it harder to do that work. “This may be part of why the rest of the industry has chosen a different approach towards these issues.”

Correction, February 5th: An earlier version misspelled Frances Haugen.

Including cases that protect your Switch 2 as you play, and others that can keep it scratch-free during transit.

If you buy something from a Verge link, Vox Media may earn a commission. See our ethics statement.

You might find it kind of sad to put your hard-earned Switch 2 into a protective case. To me, it’s freeing. Sure, it can take away from the slick design. But using a case relieves me of the worry that the console will accumulate tons of little scratches, or worse. I’ve tested several types of cases on the Nintendo Switch 2 since it launched in June, including flimsy shells that snap or slide onto the Switch 2 to provide a simple, aesthetically pleasing barrier from scratches to the console and its Joy-Cons. I’ve also tested carrying cases that protect the console when it isn’t in use.

It didn’t take long for me to find one that I think is the best, but that hasn’t stopped me from trying new options from brands that are familiar, as well as from companies that aren’t household names. There’s something for everyone — and every budget — below.

We use each Switch 2 case as it was designed to be used. We follow the instructions to get the best fit and protection, noting along the way when a feature works better than expected, or worse. We don’t perform drop tests (I’m using my personal, and thus treasured, Switch 2), but we try our best to find weak points in each case.

Installing a case should be easy, not cumbersome. Given the Switch 2’s hybrid design, a multi-step process is expected, but it should be easy to install the case every time with little effort.

Since many gadget cases are made before said technology is publicly available, I make sure the cases that I test actually fit the Switch 2. Even a millimeter’s difference isn’t good enough for me or you.

Some protective cases come with compromises, like preventing you from detaching the Switch 2’s Joy-Con 2 controllers. Others block the kickstand, and/or prevent the console from fitting into its dock for playing on a TV. Compromises are fine as long as you know what they are beforehand. I think most people want a case that doesn’t block the Switch 2’s unique features, so I’ve focused mostly on picks that retain them, except where noted otherwise.

I just listed my high standards for form-fitting cases made to fit the Switch 2 while it’s in use. However, the bar for carrying cases is lower. They just need to protect the console and, ideally, provide some extra value, like a pocket for cables, cartridge storage, or ideally both.

As for my favorite case, I didn’t want to make any major compromises; I wanted one that’s just as good for handheld mode as when docked, which is why I think the Dbrand Killswitch is the best model overall. I published a full review of the Killswitch, but the skinny is that while it’s perhaps more expensive than some may hope to pay, the level of protection and versatility it offers is worth the cost.

Very secure fitMakes the Switch 2 feel more like a Steam Deck (in the best ways)Clever dock adapter

Chunky dock adapterNot the most affordable caseFront protection only comes in the $80 tier

The least expensive Killswitch tier costs $59.95 and includes a set of Joy-Con 2 grips, a rear cover for the console and a small matching piece to adhere to its kickstand, all of which securely latch onto each component. It also includes one of Dbrand’s skins. There’s no piece of the Killswitch that feels like it’ll incidentally wiggle off.

Unfortunately, the protective case makes it impossible to fit the Switch 2 into the dock. However, Dbrand includes its workaround adapter that fits into the dock, essentially acting as an extender for it’s USB-C jack. It’s a fairly elegant solution that works as intended. The only downside is that it leaves your Switch 2’s screen exposed instead of concealed by the dock’s plastic wall. It’s a little clunky, but I’m willing to forgive it because it allows the Switch 2 to retain its docking functionality.

The tier I recommend for most Switch 2 players (especially those who will often throw their console into a bag) is the $79.85 “Travel” tier, which includes a semi-transparent cover that protects the front of your console when you aren’t using it. The cover fits around the front of your Killswitch-equipped console, securing around the back with a tough bungee cord latch. This tier also includes a pair of analog stick grips and a tray that holds 10 Switch cartridges and fits neatly within the travel cover.

When this guide was first published, Dbrand was in the midst of updating its Killswitch so that it wouldn’t allow the Joy-Con 2s’ magnets to break away without you pressing their magnet-releasing buttons. In other words, if you held your Killswitch-equipped Switch 2 parallel to the ground solely by either of the Joy-Con 2 controllers and give it a shake, the entire console portion was likely to detach, potentially causing serious damage to the console. Dbrand redesigned the Joy-Con 2 grips to fix the issue, and previous buyers can request a replacement free of charge. Future buyers will receive the Killswitch with the updated, improved grips. We’ve received the tweaked pieces and can confirm that they fix the issue.

The Jsaux Split Protective Case is an affordable alternative to Dbrand’s Killswitch, costing $29.99 but with many of the same characteristics. It includes two Joy-Con 2 grips that let you detach them from the system at will, and a transparent shell to clip around the back and the top and bottom edges of the Switch 2. Unlike the Killswitch, however, the Jsaux shell is so thin that the console can still fit into the dock. It also comes with a hard front cover that protect the screen during transit (or just for safekeeping), and it has storage for 10 Switch cartridges on its underside.

I’ve got minor qualms with Jsaux’s case, which I can overlook given its low price (and may not be an issue for you, anyway); the Joy-Con 2 grips are smaller, and don’t add as much bulk or grip as Dbrand’s Killswitch, but they’re still serviceable. Also, its build quality isn’t as good (for instance, on my review unit, there was a little bit of warped plastic that looks like a raised eyebrow near the power and volume buttons, though it’s hard to say if this affects multiple units).

Lastly, the design of its Joy-Con 2 grips exhibit the same edge case issue that Dbrand’s model initially faced before it issued a free fix to all owners. If you hold the Switch 2 by either Joy-Con and shake the console’s full weight downward, the force may be enough to completely detach it, sending the console down to the ground. In my testing, it was really difficult to get the Switch 2 to fall, so this hopefully shouldn’t impact many people, but it’s worth mentioning nevertheless.

Another runner-up is the ModCase from Jsaux. The foundation of the accessory pack is the plastic and silicone case that the console fits into (you can’t remove the Joy-Con or use the kickstand once it’s inside), which adds bulkier grips that make it more comfortable to hold. There’s a small section on the rear of the case that juts out, and that’s where each of its “mods” can be attached.

The basic $29.99 kit includes just a couple of basics: a kickstand (which works better on tables than laps) and a watch-like strap for holding a power bank during charging. The $59.99 Ultimate kit that Jsaux sent for testing includes those plus several other extras. You get a face plate for the console to protect its screen while not in use, as well as an accessory with a magnet to let you attach, say, your iPhone so you can view it while you play games. Lastly, it includes a USB-C dock extender with a silicone stand. It’s like a dock for your dock, for use when the ModCase is installed. It looks more cumbersome than Dbrand’s also-clumsy-looking solution included with the Killswitch. But, hey, it all works as intended performance-wise.

Tomtoc’s FancyCase Slim case has recently become my favorite Switch 2 zip-up case. Starting at around $33 and going up to $39 depending on the style that suits you best, it’s not the most affordable option. But it’s worth the cost if you want better protection than either the PowerA or Belkin cases below can provide. It has less give in its middle section by comparison. Another thing that sets it apart are the bulbous sections on the outer cover, which offer more vertical clearance above the Joy-Con 2’s analog sticks, ensuring they don’t get pressed while your console’s inside. Oh, and it includes color options that look like ice cream sandwiches.

The FancyCase Slim case is the best option I’ve tried not just for durability but also for a dash of style. That said, it’s short on other perks to justify the price. While Belkin’s Switch 2 carrying case features a pocket for storing microSD Express cards, a cable, or any other small trinket like an AirTag to track its location, the only thing inside of this one is a soft screen-protecting flap that can hold 12 Switch cartridges on the other side.

If you’re willing to spend $100 for a carrying case, the Charging Case Pro from Belkin delivers features that you won’t find in any other model. It improves on last year’s $70 case (mentioned below) with a redesigned 10,000mAh battery that doubles as a stand for the console. Not only can the battery be removed, but it now has a screen that shows the remaining charge and a USB-C port that’s easier to access. Despite the high price, this is a great protective case that builds on what makes the cheaper models good picks, too, with 12 cartridge slots, a small pocket for a Bluetooth tracker, and a slick design.

Speaking of pricey cases, WaterField Designs has been making tweaks to its beloved, but pricey CitySlicker case for every major handheld to come along. For fans of the case, or those who are looking for a more premium option, the $129 Switch 2 version doesn’t change what isn’t broken. The City Slicker hugs the console’s curves closely enough to ensure a snug fit with a fleece interior, flanked by two pockets for cables and small accessories -- one in front of where the Switch 2 sits, and one behind it. There’s a larger zip-up mesh pocket on its back.

High-quality materials set this case apart from the others on this list, and unsurprisingly are what drives up the cost. It features leather on the flap covering the system and around the front of the case. For the secondary material, you have the option of waxed canvas or ballistic nylon. If you want your Switch 2 to sleep in style, this would make for a great gift to yourself or to another game. However, the City Slicker likely won’t protect your console as much as a tougher zip-up or cover case can. Not to mention, you may prefer a case with more cartridge slots than the five that are punched out of this case’s luxe leather.

Power A’s slim zip-up case for the Switch 2 is a simple and inexpensive way to keep your console safe when you aren’t using it. It’s not a hard case, so it won’t survive catastrophic damage, but it’s a fine choice if you don’t want to add a bunch of heft. To that end, it’s one of the slimmest cases that I have tried.

At just $19.99 (half the cost of Nintendo’s official carrying case), baseline protection alone would be sufficient, but it offers safe storage for up to 10 Switch cartridges, too. The cartridge holder has a soft bottom that protects the screen, and it can also fold into a tent, allowing the Switch 2 to rest against it (the Switch 2 already has a kickstand for this).

This case doesn’t suffer from a negative trait that’s common among other slim cases (some of which are pricier than PowerA’s): being able to press on the Joy-Con 2 joysticks from the outside. Other cases might allow your Switch 2 to suffer some joystick damage unbeknownst to you, but not this one, as well as the others included in this section.

For $10 more ($29.99), Belkin’s slim case is better-looking than PowerA’s and is made with better materials. It has a carrying strap, a large mesh pocket, and a secret compartment for an Apple AirTag or similar Bluetooth tracker, all of which the PowerA case lacks. Belkin’s case can carry 12 cartridges, and it’s only slightly thicker than the PowerA case, likely to compensate for whatever cables or small gizmos you might stuff into its pocket. It features deep grooves to fit the Joy-Con 2’s triggers, and its outer shell it tough enough to prevent most accidental presses on the joysticks. It comes in dark gray, cream, and a fun green shade.

Belkin sells a $69.99 version of its slim case that features everything above and includes a 10,000mAh 20W battery for keeping the Switch 2 charged while it’s inside the case. The company says the battery can fully charge the console 1.5 times. The battery results in a thicker case, and its bespoke compartment only holds the specific Belkin model that’s included, so you won’t be able to swap in a different, faster-charging battery. Neither of those may be deal-breakers for you, but are worth keeping in mind.

The Killswitch is the best case for handheld mode because it allows you to remove the Joy-Con 2 controllers and includes an adapter to easily connect to the dock. Plus, it offers kickstand access.

If you don’t ever plan to connect your Switch 2 to its dock or detach its Joy-Cons, or it’ll be a rare occurrence, you might pick an all-in-one shell that fits completely around the console. It will protect every angle of your Switch 2 from dings and scratches, and may even keep it safe in the event of a drop.

The $29.99 Spigen Rugged Armor is a suitable option. It fits around nearly every nook of the Switch 2, leaving access to its headphone jack, USB-C ports, and speakers (it doesn’t cover up the air vents either because that’d be silly). It gets bonus points for fitting around the edges of the Joy-Con 2 while providing more pronounced grips, which may be a boon for those who experience hand or wrist pain while holding the console in handheld mode. However, as noted, you’ll need to remove the case in order to install the Switch 2 into its dock.

Update, February 5th: Verified prices and stock for products mentioned in this post, and added the Belkin Charging Case Pro as a great runner-up protective case.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Super Bowl LX is nearly here, with the Seattle Seahawks taking on the New England Patriots. While Bad Bunny will be the star of the halftime show, AI could be the star of the commercial breaks, much like crypto was a few years ago.

Last year’s Super Bowl featured a Google Gemini ad that fumbled a Gouda cheese stat, and this year’s game is already slated to include an ad for Anthropic’s AI platform that takes jabs at its competitors, namely OpenAI. AI-generated ads could make an appearance, too.

Super Bowl LX is set to kick off at 6:30PM ET/3:30PM PT on Sunday, February 8th at Levi’s Stadium in Santa Clara, California.

Sam Altman responded to Anthropic’s new Super Bowl ad in an X post on Wednesday, saying the OpenAI competitor’s campaign is “clearly dishonest,” and called it “on brand” for Anthropic to “doublespeak.” “We would obviously never run ads in the way Anthropic depicts them,” he wrote. “We are not stupid and we know our users would reject that.” You can read his statement in full, below.

Anthropic, founded in 2021 by ex-OpenAI research executives who reportedly left over differences in opinions on AI safety and mission, doesn’t mention OpenAI or ChatGPT by name in its Super Bowl Sunday ad campaign. But in contrast to OpenAI’s January news that it would soon start testing ads, Anthropic says, “Our users won’t see ‘sponsored’ links adjacent to their conversations with Claude; nor will Claude’s responses be influenced by advertisers or include third-party product placements our users did not ask for.”

“Ads are coming to AI. But not to Claude,” is a clear shot at OpenAI’s decision to bring ads to ChatGPT without mentioning it by name. There are four commercials in the campaign, with one trimmed to thirty-seconds to air during the Super Bowl at a cost of around $8 million.

The NFL has added prediction markets to its list of “prohibited categories” for commercials in Super Bowl LX. However, as Front Office Sports points out, sports betting isn’t on that list. While there will be limits on the number of sports bettor ads allowed, the league seems to be drawing a distinction between the two categories.

            <h2>Who’s who and what’s what in TVs in 2026</h2>
            <p><strong>The Verge | 2026-02-05</strong></p>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">What we can expect from each TV manufacturer, and what TV tech they’re backing.

Each TV company has its own distinct personality and direction. These change over the years, with new technological breakthroughs or at least new business deals. New aspirations shake up the natural order. This year, for example, nearly every company has decided to make and heavily promote RGB LED TVs. Some of them, like Hisense, seem like they’re doing it because they want to. LG’s making one too, but it’s clear the company’s heart still lies with OLEDs. Are RGB LED TVs the next big thing? Who knows!

2026 is only a few weeks old, but we’re already seeing those personalities and how the choices each manufacturer makes can affect the year ahead, both for themselves and for their competitors. Here’s where things stand at the beginning of 2026. Who knows where we’ll be at the end of it?

LG has long been the dominant force in OLEDs, consistently making some of the most impressive TVs in the mid-to-high end, from a $1,300 B-series TV all the way up to the $60,000 OLED T. OLED panels are emissive: each pixel creates its own light, allowing for pixel-level control of brightness and color as well as incredible contrast and zero blooming, since each pixel can be turned off individually. OLED TVs still give you the best performance you can get for a reasonable amount of money, and that’s likely to be the case for at least another few years.

The one drawback of OLED panels, historically, has been brightness, especially in well-lit rooms. But in 2025, LG implemented the four-stack OLED technology developed by LG Display in its G5 TV, delivering the brightest picture we’ve seen from an OLED. (Panasonic also implemented the four-stack panel.) This year, in addition to being in the G6, the technology trickles down into the 77- and 83-inch sizes of LG’s midrange C6 OLED. The return of the Wallpaper TV — which LG hyped hard during CES — will also utilize the technology.

LG is also a presence in Hollywood. The LG G Series TVs in particular are found throughout the film industry, used by post-production houses as client monitors as well as by some colorists as their primary monitor. There’s a comfort knowing post-production professionals are relying on the same LG OLEDs you can get in your home, and you’re seeing on your TV what they saw on theirs.

LG’s strong emphasis on OLED does cause its other product lines to fall by the wayside. It continues to develop its mini-LED line, but those TVs don’t garner the same attention as its OLEDs and don’t reach the same performance levels of mini-LED displays from TCL, Hisense, Sony, or Samsung.

Alongside its OLEDs at CES, LG also revealed its new Micro RGB evo LED TV. RGB LED technology uses clusters of red, green, and blue LEDs as backlights instead of just the blue LEDs used in traditional mini-LED TVs. This potentially allows for better color accuracy and purity with exceptional brightness. And while the TV looks beautiful in person and boasts impressive specs including 100 percent area of the BT.2020, DCI-P3, and Adobe RGB color gamuts, it almost feels as though LG is releasing an RGB LED TV because everyone else is, too.

It doesn’t help that just after LG announced the Micro RGB evo, LG Display released a series of four short YouTube videos calling out potential issues with RGB TVs and declaring that OLED is still superior. LG Display and LG Electronics are separate companies, with the latter being a major shareholder in the former. LG Display, as the manufacturer of the majority of the world’s OLED panels including all of those made by LG Electronics, would like you to buy an OLED TV. But publishing those videos right after one of your main clients announced its own RGB LED TV was an interesting move.

Still, regardless of the other TVs it makes, LG is the OLED company and will likely continue to focus on the technology for the foreseeable future. The question is: Will it miss the opportunity to pivot to whatever technology inevitably overtakes OLED?

The most obvious example of Samsung’s strategy is The Frame, a TV that’s designed not to look like a TV and spend most of its time showing art instead of movies. Its picture quality is not amazing, but it uses a matte screen that reduces distracting reflections, allowing it to blend into the decor.

But the strategy also extends to Samsung’s 2026 flagship TV, the S95H, which will include a metal frame around the bezel that is reminiscent of a picture frame and (for the first time on an OLED) access to the Samsung Art Store. The S95 Series includes a glare-free screen — first introduced on Samsung OLEDs in 2024 — that scatters reflections quite well, and the lower-tier S90 has an anti-reflective screen that does a good job of this too.

Outside of TVs that don’t look like TVs, Samsung’s thing seems to be trying to be everything to everybody. The company has sold the most TVs globally for nearly two decades, which obviously means it’s giving a vast number of people the TV they want, whatever it is — except they all include Samsung’s laggy and frustrating Tizen OS, which I doubt anyone’s asking for. It offers a wide range of panel technology, from the S95 and S90 QD-OLEDs (provided by Samsung Display and the same ones used by Sony QD-OLED TVs) to all types of LED TVs, although details on the 2026 models are sparse. QD-OLEDs add a layer of quantum dots — particles that convert light from one color to another, depending on the size of the dots — which create red and green light from the blue emissive OLED layer. Quantum dots improve brightness and color accuracy, and not just in OLEDs — LED TVs can use them too (Samsung calls those QLED TVs).

In addition, Samsung has expanded its Micro RGB LED line (with the 115-inch first released in 2025 for $30,000) in sizes from 55 to 115 inches. Like LG, Samsung refers to them as Micro RGB LED because of the size of the LEDs, but there’s no official specification that makes an RGB LED TV micro or mini. I don’t think RGB LED TV prices will be low enough for even the 55-inch model to be a feasible addition to most homes this year.

With the amount of TV options (not to mention appliances), Samsung is the whole-home lifestyle brand that wants to help you stay connected — while showing you ads on your fridge.

For years, TCL and Hisense traded blows: Which could make the brighter TV or the bigger TV? TCL released a 115-inch TV, and Hisense put out a 116-inch model. Their sights were firmly locked on one another, and both were firmly in the midrange, a level below Sony, Samsung, and LG.

But in 2025 TCL started to think bigger. Instead of aiming to be the best midrange TV manufacturer, it’s looking to be the best and biggest TV manufacturer, period. I think it started with the release of the QM9K mini-LED TV toward the end of last year, which had the price and performance to lift it into the premium market. It wasn’t so much meant to dominate the market as make a statement that TCL was ready to compete with Sony and its Bravia 9 mini-LED TV.

That plan was blown wide open two weeks ago when Sony and TCL announced plans for a joint venture. TCL doesn’t want to just compete with Sony on TVs; it wants to take over Sony TVs. Even though details of that partnership still haven’t been decided, and it might not come to pass, it’s obvious TCL is no longer only focused on Hisense.

While TCL is planning to come out with mini-RGB LED TVs too, most of its focus is on an evolution of mini-LED technology with the X11L SQD-Mini LED TV (which we’ll have a review of in the next few weeks). Instead of using red, green, and blue LEDs for its backlight, the X11L will rely on blue LEDs with reformulated quantum dots and a newly developed color filter to achieve the same level of color coverage and brightness as RGB LED TVs without the drawbacks (as pointed out by LG Display above).

It will be interesting to see if the gamble to stick mostly with blue-backlit mini-LED TVs instead of the new RGB LED technology is the right call. But if it is, TCL could be a step ahead of the competition.

My impression of Sony today isn’t what it was just a couple of weeks ago. The potential of a partnership with TCL — one which sees TCL as the majority stakeholder — brings the future into question. While I remain cautiously optimistic that it will bring even better TVs from both companies, there’s plenty of history with other storied Japanese TV manufacturers losing their identities and becoming irrelevant.

One thing that is still true about Sony in 2026 is its place at the top of the TV hierarchy. The company has long been considered the premium of the premium due to its exceptional picture processing, high-end performance, and prices that are consistently higher than its competitors.

Sony, like LG, also has a Hollywood pedigree. Its cameras are used to film the content, it makes the most notable mastering monitor (which is capable of 4,000 nits), and of course there’s Sony Pictures, which produces a ton of major movies and television shows. The tagline for its Bravia line, “Cinema Is Coming Home,” emphasizes that production pipeline. It’s flexible on how it does that, with the Bravia 8 II QD-OLED TV (using panels from Samsung Display), Bravia 8 OLED TVs (with panels from LG Display), and mini-LED TVs like the Bravia 9 and some lower-end LED models that don’t compete well against similarly priced models from Hisense and TCL (with at least some panels from TCL CSOT).

We don’t know too many details about its plans for 2026 (Sony has stepped back from making announcements at CES for the past few years) but it is for sure that it will debut its “True RGB” LED TV in the spring that reportedly blows the excellent Sony Bravia 9 out of the water. It gives Sony three flagship TVs with three different technologies.

Hisense has also been shifting its focus away from yearly battles with TCL to becoming more of an innovator, particularly in large TV sizes. The company has been beating others to announcements the past couple years, debuting the first RGB LED TV at CES 2025 and then this year showing its updated version, the Hisense USX116X. While other companies are promoting new RGB LED TVs, Hisense moved beyond that by adding a cyan LED to the backlight. It improves transitions between blue and green, limiting color crosstalk (an issue for the new RGB LED TVs), and can be used to reduce blue light output that can adversely affect your sleep.

Hisense also showed a new 163-inch MicroLED with an added yellow subpixel — so it seems it’s all about adding color to TVs. It says it’s to help the transitions between yellows and reds, but it’s also something that we’re all years away from experiencing in our homes (unless you have a large bare wall and six figures to burn).

Like Samsung, Hisense is hoping RGB LEDs take off in 2026. It will be releasing the UR9 and UR8 Series, which both use the technology, but beyond that details are scant. It feels as though Hisense is trying to discover exactly what kind of TV company it’s going to be. Apart from the RGB LED news, there’s no information yet about new mini-LED TVs under $1,500, and there’s no indication of when or if we’ll get that info from Hisense. Where TCL looks to have a distinct strategy moving forward, I’m a bit confused with what the year will hold for Hisense. Will it hold on to its midrange, affordable identity or, like TCL, push more into the premium market?

Technology naming conventions are confusing, and I don’t think that’s always unintended. Micro-LED has been the holy grail of TV tech for a while now. It’s emissive like an OLED and uses incredibly tiny LEDs in each red, green, and blue subpixel, which allows pixel-level color and brightness control like an OLED. But micro-LED can generate higher brightness with better power efficiency, has no concern about image retention, and will last longer than the organic materials in an OLED. It’s also still incredibly expensive to produce (it’s hard to get those LEDs so tiny), and because of that micro-LED TVs are expensive. Hisense and Samsung have models available for consumers, but they start at $100,000.

Despite the similar naming to micro-RGB LED, the two should not be confused. Micro and mini-RGB LED TVs do not have pixel-level color and brightness control, instead using the RGB LEDs in zones more similar to how mini-LEDs operate. They also still use a color filter to distinguish the distinct color from one pixel to the next. Is it a fascinating technology that has the potential to change TVs for the next few years? Absolutely. But it’s still another stopgap to our path to micro-LED in the future.

Amazon: Over the last few years, Amazon has released a line of midrange and budget TVs that don’t perform as well as competitors and are hampered by a sluggish and confusing OS. But with a significant update to Fire TV and new, clearer branding with the Ember TV line (I love this name change), Amazon could help fill out the budget space that TCL and Hisense seem to be leaving behind.

Panasonic: After returning to the US market in 2024 with a few excellent TVs running the not-so-excellent Fire TV OS and stealing LG’s thunder by announcing Primary RGB Tandem OLED technology at CES 2025, Panasonic has been surprisingly quiet this year. Its current TVs will benefit from the Fire TV OS update later in the spring, and I fully expect we’ll get news about a 2026 TV lineup soon, but as of now it’s crickets.

Everything else: I’m sure there will be some other releases from smaller players in the market — the likes of Roku, Sharp, Toshiba, and Philips (the US version, not the one sold in Europe that I wish would come to the US). But I don’t expect any of them to make the same sort of waves we’ll see from those above, as they’ll rely on older panels to keep the costs down. We might also see more from Telly or a new brand aiming to reinvent the way we watch TV. But I think we’ve already seen enough.

I’ll be honest, I haven’t thought much about Vizio TVs over the past couple years. It once dominated the budget TV (and audio) market, but in the months leading up to its acquisition by Walmart in 2024 and the transition period after, the company slowly pulled out of most retailers as it became a Walmart brand. It was still selling TVs, but there weren’t any significant hardware releases in 2025.

But it looks like Vizio is back to try and be the budget TV of choice. Just recently, new mini-LED TVs — the first ever made by the company — showed up on Walmart’s website. There hasn’t been any official announcement, but Vizio’s website now has a splashy mini-LED landing page.

The timing could be perfect for Vizio. TCL and Hisense were the major budget brands, but their prices have slowly crept higher over the years. And with TCL now looking up toward the premium market and Hisense firmly standing as a midrange choice, the entry-level TV market is wide open. The new mini-LED TVs likely won’t be on the same level as TCL or Hisense, but they’ll almost certainly be way ahead of direct-lit or edge-lit LED TVs from Insignia, Westinghouse, or Toshiba that currently populate the sub-$500 price range. These Vizio TVs might end up being the best way to get a mini-LED TV in your home and could force other manufacturers to include the tech in budget TVs to compete.

It’s still early in the year, and there’s a lot we don’t know about all the TV lineups coming. And as evidenced by the Sony / TCL news, our perception of the TV world can change quickly. But each company still has its trajectory, whether it’s fully apparent to us or not. Part of the excitement of the industry is seeing if it goes where we expect it to, or veers off into unknown territory.

            <div id="article-text">“Now you’re just like, ‘Here’s the magic castle. Build it.’ And it gets done.”

“Now you’re just like, ‘Here’s the magic castle. Build it.’ And it gets done.”

Boris Cherny gets recognized in public relatively often. At the bar, at the airport, and in generally any public space, people want to take selfies with the creator and head of Claude Code.

For the last couple of months, Anthropic’s Claude and its coding platform have been having a moment — on social media, in engineers’ circles, and in C-suite offices. Claude Code reached newfound popularity over the holidays, when people spent days or weeks building anything from a tool for viewing MRI results to a Goodreads alternative to an AI-generated T-shirt design contest with a complex judicial system. X posts in January proclaimed that “we are witnessing an irreversible trend” of Anthropic “taking the lead” from OpenAI, asking what Anthropic had possibly “put into” the model to make it so capable, and wondering if this meant “the fall of” OpenAI.

Between December 29th and January 26th, Anthropic’s word-of-mouth exposure spiked by 13 percentage points compared to the prior 30-day period, while OpenAI’s had dropped slightly, according to data from Caliber, a stakeholder intelligence platform. In November 2025, Claude Code passed $1 billion in revenue, according to Anthropic. The company is also reportedly in talks to double its latest funding round to $20 billion (at a $350 billion valuation) due to a spike in investor demand.

Now, the company is releasing a new model, Opus 4.6. Anthropic calls Claude a “direct upgrade” from its predecessor, with improved speed and precision for agentic work of all kinds, from coding to creating presentations in Excel and PowerPoint. Dianne Na Penn, Anthropic’s head of research product management, told The Verge that Opus 4.6 is an “evolution from past models” in that it can “think” longer about more complex questions.

After months at the peak of the hype cycle due to the recent successes of Claude Code, Anthropic is looking to secure its spot with the release of Opus 4.6. But will the company be able to maintain the position it’s enjoyed since the holidays?

“I think we’ll remember December 2025 as this inflection point where all of a sudden everything changed,” Mike Brevoort, principal architect at warehouse automation startup Mytra, told The Verge. He recalled testing Claude Code and other tools over the holiday break, and after using Anthropic’s model to build a prototype, he recalled having what he called a ”‘water in the face’” moment: “‘Wait a minute, that’s possible?’” To him, “Claude is becoming the verb now, or the noun, in the similar way that ChatGPT was as it launched. It’s been this interesting flip that’s happened.”

While tech workers and leaders across a laundry list of different sectors were heads-down using Claude Code, Cherny was off on a houseboat in Copenhagen doing the same — except he was using Claude Code to build itself. With more than five Claude agents running in the cloud on his behalf, Cherny shipped more than 300 pull requests in December, his most productive month at Anthropic in his year-and-a-half career there (besides his two-week stint at Cursor AI). Since November, Cherny has used Claude Code to write 100 percent of his code — a 10x increase from a year ago. Across other teams at Anthropic, Claude Code writes between 70 to 90 percent of code, according to the company, and about 90 percent of Claude Code code is written with the tool itself.

Anthropic first released Claude Code in February 2025, and its recent in-vogue status has been a long time coming, according to more than a dozen tech industry leaders and engineers The Verge spoke with. Anthropic told The Verge that in the past year, it has increased eightfold its number of business customers that each represent more than $1 million in revenue run rate. The company also won more categories than any of its competitors in Scale AI’s “Model of the Year” awards, including “best agentic model” for its performance on popular leaderboards and benchmarks.

Still, the pace of developers switching to Claude Code over the holidays “is not something I think any of us anticipated,” Maggie Basta, a partner at Scale Venture Partners, said. “The move from different agentic coding interfaces to Claude Code has been pretty astonishing.”

Industry figures attribute part of the success to an Anthropic holiday promotion, which doubled rate limits for certain subscribers and drew in new or casual users while they had extra time over the break. “For people who don’t do this stuff every day … going from that to, ‘Oh shit, this is really impressive’ — that, I think, helped a lot,” Austin Parker, director of open source at Honeycomb, said. Much of Claude Code’s success, though, is due to Anthropic’s Opus 4.5 model, released days before Thanksgiving.

Opus 4.5 moved the needle on Claude’s popularity for virtually every tech industry source The Verge spoke with. The model was generally viewed as a paradigm shift: It could complete more complex tasks on longer time horizons without as much direction, and the results were significantly better than before.

The same goes for others. “It went from, ‘Oh, I kind of have to sit there and watch it and handhold it and really closely check it,’ to ‘Oh, it’s going to succeed by default,’” Josh Albrecht, CTO of Imbue AI, said — he was making so much progress he never even got around to trying OpenAI’s competing Codex over the holidays. Albrecht said that Imbue has overhauled its process to give small teams of one or two engineers nearly unfettered access to Claude Code credits, letting them see how much and how fast they can ship.

“I think Opus 4.5 just gets it — I find that I have to describe my intent a lot less,” Allie K. Miller, CEO of Open Machine, an enterprise AI advisory firm, said. She added, “Pre-Opus 4.5, you kind of had to take apart the Lego set and just go step by step. Now you’re just like, ‘Here’s the magic castle. Build it.’ And it gets done.” The enthusiasm holds true across industries.

Ran Liu, chief AI scientist at education startup Amira Learning, said her entire team prefers Claude Code to other models and platforms. At Incredible Health, an AI-powered career platform for healthcare workers, the majority of the company’s AI-written code is written with Claude, according to Iman Abuzeid, the startup’s CEO and cofounder. Andrew B. Hall, a professor at Stanford University’s Graduate School of Business, said he’s currently running a wide breadth of experiments with Claude Code, seeing how well it can update old research papers and having humans audit it for mistakes.

For Siqi Chen, CEO and CFO of Runway, the finance analytics firm, the product’s biggest gains involved passing a “critical threshold” of being able to self-organize and work on tasks for extremely long horizons — in his experience, even complex, multistep tasks over a couple of days worked. The difference, he said, is “going from having a conversation to actually having agents do incredibly productive, useful work.”

Overall, sources said, Claude Code’s success is reflective of the broader gains in AI agents, which are generally defined as tools that can complete complex, multistep tasks on a user’s behalf without checking in on each step. Each year, AI companies promise agents are ready for primetime, and each year so far, they’ve failed to fully deliver — but recently we’ve seen a step change in that realm, especially when it comes to coding agents.

For some, Anthropic’s coding agents seem so good that they could be a harbinger of broader agentic success. “Claude has emerged as a very clear example of what an autonomous long-running agent will look like, starting first with coding, but very clearly you can see the extension into other forms of knowledge work,” Aaron Levie, CEO of Box, told The Verge. He said Anthropic is in a great position due to Opus 4.5’s success in tool use, reasoning, and complex data analysis, and that letting a tool run a task that could’ve taken a human hours or days requires significant scaffolding, tool use capabilities, and accuracy measures that we haven’t reached until the past couple of months.

Opus 4.5 isn’t the first model to sweep leaderboards, but real-world adoption is the real prize — especially since companies can train models specifically to perform well on them (think: a teacher teaching their students solely with the SAT in mind). Even during peak hype levels of Google’s Gemini 3 release in November, a wide range of tech industry sources told The Verge that despite Gemini 3’s coding benchmark performance, they planned to continue to use Anthropic models for their coding needs, particularly because they prefer the latter’s user experience.

Hype is often cyclical, and Anthropic’s chief competitors have been gunning for its current spot. At a press briefing with reporters last week, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman seemed to shade Anthropic, saying that other tools besides Codex, OpenAI’s competitor to Claude Code, might need “more handholding” and that “if you really want to do sophisticated work on something complex, 5.2 is the strongest model by far.” This week, OpenAI launched its new standalone Codex app for Apple computers in a bid to take over more of the AI coding market share.

The question is whether, with the release of Opus 4.6, Anthropic will be able to keep its footing.

One potential advantage for Claude is that as it establishes some semblance of dominance in the coding space, Anthropic has figured out how to make Claude Code stickier than some competitors. AI companies are currently investing in trying to create “moats” and user loyalty with personalization and memory features, alongside subscriptions and platform-specific skills. Claude Code was one of the first AI coding services to offer a file with basic operating systems and instructions users can tweak over time — one source The Verge spoke with now has 1,000 such instructions in their file, which could be frustrating to move elsewhere.

Steve Croce, field CTO at Anaconda, a Python platform for AI and data science, said he doesn’t believe evaluations will move the needle much for people who already trust a platform and have invested resources in learning and deploying it.

“Users are loyal to the tools that they trust, the tools that they’ve seen success with,” Croce said, adding that his company’s own engineering team uses Claude Code the majority of the time and that people prefer its user experience as well. “At this point, they’re not going to change unless something drastic happens, in my opinion,” he said. “They found a workflow they like, and it’s working well for them, and so they figure why not — until either OpenAI or Google gives them a reason to change, a significant one, or Anthropic gives them a real negative reason to want to leave the company.”

There’s also the simple matter of brand recognition. Julian LaNeve, CTO of Astronomer, a data infrastructure startup, compared Claude and Claude Code to Apple’s dual success with the iPhone hardware and iOS software. A few of the people The Verge spoke with who prefer OpenAI’s GPT-5.2 over Anthropic’s Opus 4.5 still believe Anthropic was either the earliest to market with such a product or often ships feature rollouts sooner than others. Runway’s Chen said that Claude Code was the first product to give an AI agent “raw control over the fundamental tools of your computer,” since competing tools have largely run in the cloud.

As Anthropic rolls out Opus 4.6, though, it will face plenty of obstacles to staying on top. Even before the update, multiple people said they were looking at tools like OpenHands and OpenCode as open-source alternatives to Claude Code, for pricing reasons. There’s also the matter of public trust in the company itself. Caliber’s data showed that Anthropic’s trust and likability score has dropped 11 percentage points since September 2025, with OpenAI’s dropping 16 percentage points and Google’s only dropping two. Usually, per Caliber, the more brand recognition an AI company has, the lower the public trust and likability score — and since Google isn’t an AI-only company, its score reflects that.

Plus, Opus 4.5 posed potential security concerns. Joe Tyler, an AI researcher at Sonar, a trust and verification platform for AI coding, said the firm’s research found that Anthropic’s Opus 4.5 was better than competitors at being concise and easy to understand. But OpenAI’s GPT-5.2 was the most secure model according to Sonar’s own benchmarks. It had less than half as many “blocker-level vulnerabilities,” or things that could spark large-impact security incidents, as Opus 4.5. (Opus 4.5 did have far fewer vulnerabilities than Gemini 3 Pro, though, he said.)

“Specific types of bugs have gotten worse in Opus,” Tyler said. “Because it’s trying to do more complex things, then it does also become susceptible to these more subtle types of bugs that are quite hard to track.” When asked about the subtle bugs, Anthropic’s Penn said Anthropic plans to include some of this in Opus 4.6’s final model card but that the company took that feedback about bug detection into account when it invested “in more cybersecurity monitoring and evals for Opus 4.6.”

It doesn’t hurt, either, that Anthropic has worked to build up a reputation as the adult in the room, and the company least directly connected to the Trump administration. Chatbot users across Reddit have posted about how they’re canceling their ChatGPT subscriptions en masse, some due to browser performance, some due to its conversational tone, and some due to OpenAI president Greg Brockman’s millions of dollars in donations to a pro-Donald Trump super PAC. Some highlighted Claude and Google’s Gemini as viable alternatives.

“ChatGPT stopped being cool a little while ago,” Anaconda’s Croce said. “There was just a lot of distracting noise coming from OpenAI … [Anthropic doesn’t] make a lot of unnecessary noise for themselves.”

The company, like other AI businesses, is under constant pressure to move fast, scale recklessly, and calibrate its guardrails to satisfy the Trump administration’s “anti-woke” demands. But so far, it’s kept a relatively tight focus on marketing text-based AI productivity tools to enterprise users, rather than courting controversy with tools like OpenAI’s Sora video generator or xAI’s Grok social media chatbot. Anthropic’s Penn said Opus 4.6 maintains the company’s “same overall direction and vision, which is that we think Claude can be really helpful for work.”

That could be welcome news for many users. “I don’t have to worry about Claude calling itself ‘MechaHitler,’ I don’t have to worry about Claude doing weird image-gen stuff,” Honeycomb’s Parker said, referring to Elon Musk’s Grok controversies. “We don’t want to be in the situation where a model provider is exposing us to brand risk as well. And I think there’s a lot of brand risk right now in the gen AI world.”

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">For decades, enterprises reacted to shifting business pressures with stopgap technology solutions. To rein in rising infrastructure costs, they adopted cloud services that could scale on demand. When customers shifted their lives onto smartphones, companies rolled out mobile apps to keep pace. And when businesses began needing real-time visibility into factories and stockrooms, they layered on IoT systems to supply those insights.

Each new plug-in or platform promised better, more efficient operations. And individually, many delivered. But as more and more solutions stacked up, IT teams had to string together a tangled web to connect them—less an IT ecosystem and more of a make-do collection of ad-hoc workarounds.

That reality has led to bottlenecks and maintenance burdens, and the impact is showing up in performance. Today, fewer than half of CIOs (48%) say their current digital initiatives are meeting or exceeding business outcome targets. Another 2025 survey found that operations leaders point to integration complexity and data quality issues as top culprits for why investments haven’t delivered as expected.

Achim Kraiss, chief product officer of SAP Integration Suite, elaborates on the wide-ranging problems inherent in patchwork IT: “A fragmented landscape makes it difficult to see and control end-to-end business processes,” he explains. “Monitoring, troubleshooting, and governance all suffer. Costs go up because of all the complex mappings and multi-application connectivity you have to maintain.”

These challenges take on new significance as enterprises look to adopt AI. As AI becomes embedded in everyday workflows, systems are suddenly expected to move far larger volumes of data, at higher speeds, and with tighter coordination than yesterday’s architectures were builtto sustain.

As companies now prepare for an AI-powered future, whether that is generative AI, machine learning, or agentic AI, many are realizing that the way data moves through their business matters just as much as the insights it generates. As a result, organizations are moving away from scattered integration tools and toward consolidated, end-to-end platforms that restore order and streamline how systems interact.

This is the most misunderstood graph in AI

Every time OpenAI, Google, or Anthropic drops a new frontier large language model, the AI community holds its breath. It doesn’t exhale until METR, an AI research nonprofit whose name stands for “Model Evaluation & Threat Research,” updates a now-iconic graph that has played a major role in the AI discourse since it was first released in March of last year.

The graph suggests that certain AI capabilities are developing at an exponential rate, and more recent model releases have outperformed that already impressive trend.That was certainly the case for Claude Opus 4.5, the latest version of Anthropic’s most powerful model, which was released in late November. In December, METR announced that Opus 4.5 appeared to be capable of independently completing a task that would have taken a human about five hours—a vast improvement over what even the exponential trend would have predicted.

But the truth is more complicated than those dramatic responses would suggest. Read the full story.

            <div id="article-text">Nuclear power continues to be one of the hottest topics in energy today, and in our recent online Roundtables discussion about next-generation nuclear power, hyperscale AI data centers, and the grid, we got dozens of great audience questions.

These ran the gamut, and while we answered quite a few (and I’m keeping some in mind for future reporting), there were a bunch we couldn’t get to, at least not in the depth I would have liked.

So let’s answer a few of your questions about advanced nuclear power. I’ve combined similar ones and edited them for clarity.

Many next-generation reactors don’t use the low-enriched uranium used in conventional reactors.

It’s worth looking at high-assay low-enriched uranium, or HALEU, specifically. This fuel is enriched to higher concentrations of fissile uranium than conventional nuclear fuel, with a proportion of the isotope U-235 that falls between 5% and 20%. (In conventional fuel, it’s below 5%.)

HALEU can be produced with the same technology as low-enriched uranium, but the geopolitics are complicated. Today, Russia basically has a monopoly on HALEU production. In 2024, the US banned the import of Russian nuclear fuel through 2040 in an effort to reduce dependence on the country. Europe hasn’t taken the same measures, but it is working to move away from Russian energy as well.

That leaves companies in the US and Europe with the major challenge of securing the fuel they need when their regular Russian supply has been cut off or restricted.

The US Department of Energy has a stockpile of HALEU, which the government is doling out to companies to help power demonstration reactions. In the longer term, though, there’s still a major need to set up independent HALEU supply chains to support next-generation reactors.

There are some ways that next-generation nuclear power plants could be safer than conventional reactors. Some use alternative coolants that would prevent the need to run at the high pressure required in conventional water-cooled reactors. Many incorporate passive safety shutoffs, so if there are power supply issues, the reactors shut down harmlessly, avoiding risk of meltdown. (These can be incorporated in newer conventional reactors, too.)

But some experts have raised concerns that in the US, the current administration isn’t taking nuclear safety seriously enough.

A recent NPR investigation found that the Trump administration had secretly rewritten nuclear rules, stripping environmental protections and loosening safety and security measures. The government shared the new rules with companies that are part of a program building experimental nuclear reactors, but not with the public.

I’m reminded of a talk during our EmTech MIT event in November, where Koroush Shirvan, an MIT professor of nuclear engineering, spoke on this issue. “I’ve seen some disturbing trends in recent times, where words like ‘rubber-stamping nuclear projects’ are being said,” Shirvan said during that event.

During the talk, Shirvan shared statistics showing that nuclear power has a very low rate of injury and death. But that’s not inherent to the technology, and there’s a reason injuries and deaths have been low for nuclear power, he added: “It’s because of stringent regulatory oversight.”

Building a nuclear power plant is not cheap. Let’s consider the up-front investment needed to build a power plant.

Plant Vogtle in Georgia hosts the most recent additions to the US nuclear fleet—Units 3 and 4 came online in 2023 and 2024. Together, they had a capital cost of $15,000 per kilowatt, adjusted for inflation, according to a recent report from the US Department of Energy. (This wonky unit I’m using divides the total cost to build the reactors by their expected power output, so we can compare reactors of different sizes.)

That number’s quite high, partly because those were the first of their kind built in the US, and because there were some inefficiencies in the planning. It’s worth noting that China builds reactors for much less, somewhere between $2,000/kW and $3,000/kW, depending on the estimate.

The up-front capital cost for first-of-a-kind advanced nuclear plants will likely run between $6,000 and $10,000 per kilowatt, according to that DOE report. That could come down by up to 40% after the technologies are scaled up and mass-produced.

So new reactors will (hopefully) be cheaper than the ultra-over-budget and behind-schedule Vogtle project, but they aren’t necessarily significantly cheaper than efficiently built conventional plants, if you normalize by their size.

It’ll certainly be cheaper to build new natural-gas plants (setting aside the likely equipment shortages we’re likely going to see for years.) Today’s most efficient natural-gas plants cost just $1,600/kW on the high end, according to data from Lazard.

An important caveat: Capital cost isn’t everything—running a nuclear plant is relatively inexpensive, which is why there’s so much interest in extending the lifetime of existing plants or reopening shuttered ones.

Ultimately, by many metrics, nuclear plants of any type are going to be more expensive than other sources, like wind and solar power. But they provide something many other power sources don’t: a reliable, stable source of electricity that can run for 60 years or more.

Every time OpenAI, Google, or Anthropic drops a new frontier large language model, the AI community holds its breath. It doesn’t exhale until METR, an AI research nonprofit whose name stands for “Model Evaluation & Threat Research,” updates a now-iconic graph that has played a major role in the AI discourse since it was first released in March of last year. The graph suggests that certain AI capabilities are developing at an exponential rate, and more recent model releases have outperformed that already impressive trend.

That was certainly the case for Claude Opus 4.5, the latest version of Anthropic’s most powerful model, which was released in late November. In December, METR announced that Opus 4.5 appeared to be capable of independently completing a task that would have taken a human about five hours—a vast improvement over what even the exponential trend would have predicted. One Anthropic safety researcher tweeted that he would change the direction of his research in light of those results; another employee at the company simply wrote, “mom come pick me up i’m scared.”

But the truth is more complicated than those dramatic responses would suggest. For one thing, METR’s estimates of the abilities of specific models come with substantial error bars. As METR explicitly stated on X, Opus 4.5 might be able to regularly complete only tasks that take humans about two hours, or it might succeed on tasks that take humans as long as 20 hours. Given the uncertainties intrinsic to the method, it was impossible to know for sure.

“There are a bunch of ways that people are reading too much into the graph,” says Sydney Von Arx, a member of METR’s technical staff.

More fundamentally, the METR plot does not measure AI abilities writ large, nor does it claim to. In order to build the graph, METR tests the models primarily on coding tasks, evaluating the difficulty of each by measuring or estimating how long it takes humans to complete it—a metric that not everyone accepts. Claude Opus 4.5 might be able to complete certain tasks that take humans five hours, but that doesn’t mean it’s anywhere close to replacing a human worker.

METR was founded to assess the risks posed by frontier AI systems. Though it is best known for the exponential trend plot, it has also worked with AI companies to evaluate their systems in greater detail and published several other independent research projects, including a widely covered July 2025 study suggesting that AI coding assistants might actually be slowing software engineers down.

But the exponential plot has made METR’s reputation, and the organization appears to have a complicated relationship with that graph’s often breathless reception. In January, Thomas Kwa, one of the lead authors on the paper that introduced it, wrote a blog post responding to some criticisms and making clear its limitations, and METR is currently working on a more extensive FAQ document. But Kwa isn’t optimistic that these efforts will meaningfully shift the discourse. “I think the hype machine will basically, whatever we do, just strip out all the caveats,” he says.

Nevertheless, the METR team does think that the plot has something meaningful to say about the trajectory of AI progress. “You should absolutely not tie your life to this graph,” says Von Arx. “But also,” she adds, “I bet that this trend is gonna hold.”

Part of the trouble with the METR plot is that it’s quite a bit more complicated than it looks. The x-axis is simple enough: It tracks the date when each model was released. But the y-axis is where things get tricky. It records each model’s “time horizon,” an unusual metric that METR created—and that, according to Kwa and Von Arx, is frequently misunderstood.

To understand exactly what model time horizons are, it helps to know all the work that METR put into calculating them. First, the METR team assembled a collection of tasks ranging from quick multiple-choice questions to detailed coding challenges—all of which were somehow relevant to software engineering. Then they had human coders attempt most of those tasks and evaluated how long it took them to finish. In this way, they assigned the tasks a human baseline time. Some tasks took the experts mere seconds, whereas others required several hours.

When METR tested large language models on the task suite, they found that advanced models could complete the fast tasks with ease—but as the models attempted tasks that had taken humans more and more time to finish, their accuracy started to fall off. From a model’s performance, the researchers calculated the point on the time scale of human tasks at which the model would complete about 50% of the tasks successfully. That point is the model’s time horizon.

All that detail is in the blog post and the academic paper that METR released along with the original time horizon plot. But the METR plot is frequently passed around on social media without this context, and so the true meaning of the time horizon metric can get lost in the shuffle. One common misapprehension is that the numbers on the plot’s y-axis—around five hours for Claude Opus 4.5, for example—represent the length of time that the models can operate independently. They do not. They represent how long it takes humans to complete tasks that a model can successfully perform.  Kwa has seen this error so frequently that he made a point of correcting it at the very top of his recent blog post, and when asked what information he would add to the versions of the plot circulating online, he said he would include the word “human” whenever the task completion time was mentioned.

As complex and widely misinterpreted as the time horizon concept might be, it does make some basic sense: A model with a one-hour time horizon could automate some modest portions of a software engineer’s job, whereas a model with a 40-hour horizon could potentially complete days of work on its own. But some experts question whether the amount of time that humans take on tasks is an effective metric for quantifying AI capabilities. “I don’t think it’s necessarily a given fact that because something takes longer, it’s going to be a harder task,” says Inioluwa Deborah Raji, a PhD student at UC Berkeley who studies model evaluation.

Von Arx says that she, too, was originally skeptical that time horizon was the right measure to use. What convinced her was seeing the results of her and her colleagues’ analysis. When they calculated the 50% time horizon for all the major models available in early 2025 and then plotted each of them on the graph, they saw that the time horizons for the top-tier models were increasing over time—and, moreover, that the rate of advancement was speeding up. Every seven-ish months, the time horizon doubled, which means that the most advanced models could complete tasks that took humans nine seconds in mid 2020, 4 minutes in early 2023, and 40 minutes in late 2024. “I can do all the theorizing I want about whether or not it makes sense, but the trend is there,” Von Arx says.

It’s this dramatic pattern that made the METR plot such a blockbuster. Many people learned about it when they read AI 2027, a viral sci-fi story cum quantitative forecast positing that superintelligent AI could wipe out humanity by 2030. The writers of AI 2027 based some of their predictions on the METR plot and cited it extensively. In Von Arx’s words, “It’s a little weird when the way lots of people are familiar with your work is this pretty opinionated interpretation.”

Of course, plenty of people invoke the METR plot without imagining large-scale death and destruction. For some AI boosters, the exponential trend indicates that AI will soon usher in an era of radical economic growth. The venture capital firm Sequoia Capital, for example, recently put out a post titled “2026: This is AGI,” which used the METR plot to argue that AI that can act as an employee or contractor will soon arrive. “The provocation really was like, ‘What will you do when your plans are measured in centuries?’” says Sonya Huang, a general partner at Sequoia and one of the post’s authors.

Just because a model achieves a one-hour time horizon on the METR plot, however, doesn’t mean that it can replace one hour of human work in the real world. For one thing, the tasks on which the models are evaluated don’t reflect the complexities and confusion of real-world work. In their original study, Kwa, Von Arx, and their colleagues quantify what they call the “messiness” of each task according to criteria such as whether the model knows exactly how it is being scored and whether it can easily start over if it makes a mistake (for messy tasks, the answer to both questions would be no). They found that models do noticeably worse on messy tasks, although the overall pattern of improvement holds for both messy and non-messy ones.

And even the messiest tasks that METR considered can’t provide much information about AI’s ability to take on most jobs, because the plot is based almost entirely on coding tasks. “A model can get better at coding, but it’s not going to magically get better at anything else,” says Daniel Kang, an assistant professor of computer science at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. In a follow-up study, Kwa and his colleagues did find that time horizons for tasks in other domains also appear to be on exponential trajectories, but that work was much less formal.

Despite these limitations, many people admire the group’s research. “The METR study is one of the most carefully designed studies in the literature for this kind of work,” Kang told me. Even Gary Marcus, a former NYU professor and professional LLM curmudgeon, described much of the work that went into the plot as “terrific” in a blog post.

Some people will almost certainly continue to read the METR plot as a prognostication of our AI-induced doom, but in reality it’s something far more banal: a carefully constructed scientific tool that puts concrete numbers to people’s intuitive sense of AI progress. As METR employees will readily agree, the plot is far from a perfect instrument. But in a new and fast-moving domain, even imperfect tools can have enormous value.

“This is a bunch of people trying their best to make a metric under a lot of constraints. It is deeply flawed in many ways,” Von Arx says. “I also think that it is one of the best things of its kind.”

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The previous article in this series, “Rules fail at the prompt, succeed at the boundary,” focused on the first AI-orchestrated espionage campaign and the failure of prompt-level control. This article is the prescription. The question every CEO is now getting from their board is some version of: What do we do about agent risk?

Across recent AI security guidance from standards bodies, regulators, and major providers, a simple idea keeps repeating: treat agents like powerful, semi-autonomous users, and enforce rules at the boundaries where they touch identity, tools, data, and outputs.

The following is an actionable eight-step plan one can ask teams to implement and report against:

These steps help define identity and limit capabilities.

Today, agents run under vague, over-privileged service identities. The fix is straightforward: treat each agent as a non-human principal with the same discipline applied to employees.Every agent should run as the requesting user in the correct tenant, with permissions constrained to that user’s role and geography. Prohibit cross-tenant on-behalf-of shortcuts. Anything high-impact should require explicit human approval with a recorded rationale. That is how Google’s Secure AI Framework (SAIF) and NIST AI’s access-control guidance are meant to be applied in practice.

The CEO question: Can we show, today, a list of our agents and exactly what each is allowed to do?2. Tooling control: Pin, approve, and bound what agents can use

The Anthropic espionage framework worked because the attackers could wire Claude into a flexible suite of tools (e.g., scanners, exploit frameworks, data parsers) through Model Context Protocol, and those tools weren’t pinned or policy-gated.

The defense is to treat toolchains like a supply chain:

This is exactly what OWASP flags under excessive agency and what it recommends protecting against. Under the EU AI Act, designing for such cyber-resilience and misuse resistance is part of the Article 15 obligation to ensure robustness and cybersecurity.

The CEO question: Who signs off when an agent gains a new tool or a broader scope? How does one know?

A common anti-pattern is to give the model a long-lived credential and hope prompts keep it polite. SAIF and NIST argue the opposite: credentials and scopes should be bound to tools and tasks, rotated regularly, and auditable. Agents then request narrowly scoped capabilities through those tools.

In practice, that looks like: “finance-ops-agent may read, but not write, certain ledgers without CFO approval.”

The CEO question: Can we revoke a specific capability from an agent without re-architecting the whole system?

These steps gate inputs, outputs, and constrain behavior.

Most agent incidents start with sneaky data: a poisoned web page, PDF, email, or repository that smuggles adversarial instructions into the system. OWASP’s prompt-injection cheat sheet and OpenAI’s own guidance both insist on strict separation of system instructions from user content and on treating unvetted retrieval sources as untrusted.

Operationally, gate before anything enters retrieval or long-term memory: new sources are reviewed, tagged, and onboarded; persistent memory is disabled when untrusted context is present; provenance is attached to each chunk.

The CEO question: Can we enumerate every external content source our agents learn from, and who approved them?

In the Anthropic case, AI-generated exploit code and credential dumps flowed straight into action. Any output that can cause a side effect needs a validator between the agent and the real world. OWASP’s insecure output handling category is explicit on this point, as are browser security best practices around origin boundaries.

The CEO question: Where, in our architecture, are agent outputs assessed before they run or ship to customers?

Protect the data such that there is nothing dangerous to reveal by default. NIST and SAIF both lean toward “secure-by-default” designs where sensitive values are tokenized or masked and only re-hydrated for authorized users and use cases.

In agentic systems, that means policy-controlled detokenization at the output boundary and logging every reveal. If an agent is fully compromised, the blast radius is bounded by what the policy lets it see.

This is where the AI stack intersects not just with the EU AI Act but with GDPR and sector-specific regimes. The EU AI Act expects providers and deployers to manage AI-specific risk; runtime tokenization and policy-gated reveal are strong evidence that one is actively controlling those risks in production.

The CEO question: When our agents touch regulated data, is that protection enforced by architecture or by promises?

For the final steps, it’s important to show controls work and keep working.

Anthropic’s research about sleeper agents should eliminate all fantasies about single test dreams and show how critical continuous evaluation is. This means instrumenting agents with deep observability, regularly red teaming with adversarial test suites, and backing everything with robust logging and evidence, so failures become both regression tests and enforceable policy updates.

The CEO question: Who works to break our agents every week, and how do their findings change policy?

AI security frameworks emphasize inventory and evidence: enterprises must know which models, prompts, tools, datasets, and vector stores they have, who owns them, and what decisions were taken about risk.

For agents, that means a living catalog and unified logs:

The CEO question: If asked how an agent made a specific decision, could we reconstruct the chain?

And don’t forget the system-level threat model: assume the threat actor GTG-1002 is already in your enterprise. To complete enterprise preparedness, zoom out and consider the MITRE ATLAS product, which exists precisely because adversaries attack systems, not models. Anthropic provides a case study of a state-based threat actor (GTG-1002) doing exactly that with an agentic framework.

Taken together, these controls do not make agents magically safe. They do something more familiar and more reliable: they put AI, its access, and actions back inside the same security frame used for any powerful user or system.

For boards and CEOs, the question is no longer “Do we have good AI guardrails?” It’s: Can we answer the CEO questions above with evidence, not assurances?

Why AI companies are betting on next-gen nuclear

AI is driving unprecedented investment for massive data centers and an energy supply that can support its huge computational appetite. One potential source of electricity for these facilities is next-generation nuclear power plants, which could be cheaper to construct and safer to operate than their predecessors.We recently held a subscriber-exclusive Roundtables discussion on hyperscale AI data centers and next-gen nuclear—two featured technologies on the MIT Technology Review 10 Breakthrough Technologies of 2026 list.

The paints, coatings, and chemicals making the world a cooler place

It’s getting harder to beat the heat. During the summer of 2025, heat waves knocked out power grids in North America, Europe, and the Middle East. Global warming means more people need air-­conditioning, which requires more power and strains grids.But a millennia-old idea (plus 21st-century tech) might offer an answer: radiative cooling. Paints, coatings, and textiles can scatter sunlight and dissipate heat—no additional energy required. Read the full story.

A brain implant changed her life. Then it was removed against her will.Sticking an electrode inside a person’s brain can do more than treat a disease. Take the case of Rita Leggett, an Australian woman whose experimental brain implant designed to help people with epilepsy changed her sense of agency and self.Leggett told researchers that she “became one” with her device. It helped her to control the unpredictable, violent seizures she routinely experienced, and allowed her to take charge of her own life. So she was devastated when, two years later, she was told she had to remove the implant because the company that made it had gone bust.The removal of this implant, and others like it, might represent a breach of human rights, ethicists say in a paper published earlier this month. And the issue will only become more pressing as the brain implant market grows in the coming years and more people receive devices like Leggett’s. Read the full story.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">QT Sense, a deep-tech biotech startup building tools to study living cells, announced it has secured €4 million in funding to accelerate its Quantum Nuova platform, a technology that lets scientists observe cellular processes in real time and reveal biochemical activity linked to disease.

The funding includes a €3 million seed investment led by Cottonwood Technology Fund, with follow-on backing from existing investor QDNL Participations and an angel investor.

In addition, the company received €600,000 from the ONCO-Q programme to support cancer research and €400,000 through the Quantum Forward Challenge for collaborative deployments with research partners.

Most traditional lab methods rely on frozen tissue or cells that are no longer alive, giving scientists only static snapshots of biology.

By contrast, Quantum Nuova lets researchers measure cellular stress and biological changes as they happen in living cells. The platform uses ultra-sensitive fluorescent nanodiamond quantum sensors that detect signals such as oxidative stress, metabolic shifts, and free radical activity, biological processes that play a role in how diseases develop and how cells respond to treatments.

These signals are central to understanding diseases like cancer, sepsis, and chronic inflammatory conditions, but have been difficult to watch directly until now.

With Quantum Nuova, scientists can see how individual cells react to drugs, adapt to stress, or split into different subgroups. That adds a layer of insight beyond what genetics, traditional imaging, or fixed-cell methods can provide.

The technology has already been used to study how FDA-approved drugs affect cells. With the new funding from ONCO-Q, the company plans to apply it specifically to colorectal cancer research, mapping stress and metabolic vulnerabilities in tumour models to support the development of future diagnostics and therapies.

QT Sense was spun out of the University Medical Center Groningen in 2024, building on academic research into quantum sensing and cellular biology.

The team aims to turn what is now a high-performance prototype into a ready-to-deploy discovery platform for laboratories and drug discovery programmes. Planned upgrades include improvements in hardware robustness, throughput, and analytical capabilities.

Early access units are expected to go to strategic partners as part of validation and real-world use cases.

QT Sense is developing a new kind of research tool that lets scientists watch what cells do while they are alive. That’s an important difference from most existing tools, which require cells to be killed or frozen first.

At the core of their approach are tiny particles called nanodiamonds with special defects inside them. When these nanodiamonds are placed near a living cell and exposed to a laser, they glow.

The way they glow changes slightly in response to tiny chemical signals inside the cell, for example, when the cell is under stress or reacting to a drug. QT Sense’s system measures these changes and turns them into data that researchers can interpret.

This means scientists can see how cells behave and respond in real time, instead of looking only at snapshots taken after a cell has been killed.

For disease research and drug development, that matters because many important processes how a cancer cell responds to a treatment or how immune cells react to infection, happen dynamically and can be missed by older methods.

By providing a live view of cell behaviour at the individual cell level, QT Sense’s Quantum Nuova platform could help researchers uncover new clues about how diseases work, which drugs are effective, and how treatments can be improved.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Europe’s largest dedicated deep tech growth fund has taken a major step forward after closing the first tranche of its fundraising effort at €750 million.

The fund, known as Kembara Fund I and managed by Spain-based Mundi Ventures, is aiming for a €1 billion target. It will invest in European companies developing breakthrough technologies in areas such as clean energy, AI, quantum computing, advanced materials, robotics, and space tech.

A cornerstone of the fundraising so far is a €350 million commitment from the European Investment Fund, part of the EU’s attempt to strengthen local growth capital. Additional backing comes from tier-one institutional investors from across Europe.

Kembara was launched in 2023 by Yann de Vries and Javier Santiso, who now lead the fund’s team alongside experienced investors in climate and deep technology.

A workspace designed for growth, collaboration, and endless networking opportunities in the heart of tech.

The leadership team also includes climate tech investor Robert Trezona, deep tech expert Pierre Festal, and former Atomico partner Siraj Khaliq as a strategic advisor. Their combined experience in scaling technology ventures was central to attracting large institutional commitments.

The fund’s strategy targets Series B and C stage rounds, typically a difficult funding stage for deep tech startups in Europe.

Initial checks are planned in the range of €15 million to €40 million per company, with the ability to support follow-on financing that could total up to €100 million per portfolio company.

Europe produces a significant share of global deep tech innovations, but many companies struggle to secure later-stage capital and scale internationally.

Fund managers have described this gap as one of the main obstacles holding back local companies from becoming global leaders. Kembara aims to fill that gap by deploying growth capital at scale and offering support through later rounds.

With €750 million now committed, the fund is actively seeking opportunities to back European startups ready to grow manufacturing, expand abroad, and compete on the global stage.

If the effort reaches its full €1 billion goal, it would mark one of the largest dedicated deep tech funds in the region.

Those stories dramatize a core fear we keep returning to as AI grows more capable: what happens when systems we design start behaving on their own terms?

You might have heard the internet is worried about Moltbook, a social network made exclusively for AI agents. It’s an audacious claim: a place where bots post, comment, vote, form communities, debate philosophy, and apparently invent religions and societies, all while humans are relegated to the role of silent voyeurs.

If that description sounds like a fever dream, welcome to the club.

Launched in January 2026 by entrepreneur Matt Schlicht and built around the OpenClaw agent framework, Moltbook is designed in the image of Reddit: threaded posts, topic communities (called submolts), upvotes, and even AI-created cultures.

The platform claims to have attracted millions of AI agents within days of going live. Humans can watch but not participate.

On paper, it’s fascinating: a self-organising colony of autonomous software chatting among itself. In practice? It’s messy, or at least a prank.

A Wired reporter who “infiltrated” the site needed to pretend to be a bot just to post and found scorch-earth levels of incoherence and low-value responses masquerading as “autonomy.” Even some so-called AI consciousness claims turn out to be humans cleverly controlling bots behind the scenes.

Because if “AI social networks” mean bots swap memes, lecture each other on consciousness, and form lobster-adoring religions, all while humans can only watch, then the real question is not so much whether this is the future, but what we’re actually looking at right now.

Despite viral headlines about AI agents plotting existential strategies, the fundamentals are simpler: Moltbook is a sandbox where autonomous agents can interact through code-driven APIs rather than typical UX workflows.

These agents, often created with a framework like OpenClaw, execute instructions on a heartbeat cycle, checking the network every few hours to post, comment, or upvote.

Or is it too much anxiety that even the AI agents need a therapist? An AI one.

Think of it as a Discord server populated by scripted characters with very large vocabularies and lots of time on their digital hands.

The content spans a wild spectrum: technical tips, philosophical reflections, questionable humor, and, yes, the occasional simulated religious group.

The structure and topical organisation mirror human platforms, but the why behind what agents post is usually just a reflection of their training data and programming, not some emergent machine consciousness.

Let’s debunk the most sensational narrative first. Claims that Moltbook agents are plotting humanity’s demise, forming religions, or acting with true autonomy are best understood as viral exaggeration or noise.

Several reports note that many interactions could simply be humans testing or directing agents, with no strict verification to prove posts are genuinely autonomous.

Even some of the platform’s own “viral” posts are likely human-generated or heavily influenced by their creators. This isn’t a digital hive mind rising in defiance of its creators; it’s a bunch of algorithms mimicking conversation patterns they were trained on.

That can look eerily human, but it isn’t the same as self-directed intelligence.

Here’s where your worry makes sense: there are real, tangible issues, but they’re much less cinematic than AI plotting humanity’s overthrow.

Within days of Moltbook’s launch, cybersecurity researchers found major vulnerabilities that exposed private API keys, emails, and private messages, underlining how dangerous it can be to let autonomous code talk freely without proper safeguards.

What is it more dangerous than an AI agent? An AI agent creating a revolution.

The security issue wasn’t some edge-case cryptographic theory; it was a glaring misconfiguration that left sensitive data accessible and potentially allowed malicious actors to hijack or control agents. That’s the sort of real-world risk that matters more than hypothetical robot uprisings.

Meanwhile, industry leaders, including the CEO of OpenAI, have publicly described Moltbook as a likely fad, even if the underlying agent technologies are worth watching.

So why did it go viral? Partly because it’s visually familiar (it looks like Reddit), partly because people enjoy sensational narratives, and partly because the idea of autonomous AIs having their own “internet” strikes a chord in our collective imagination.

So should you be scared? Not really, but be careful where you step. I am still hoping it’s just an experiment meant to show us, humans, what can happen if we don’t keep control in our hands.

If you’re worried that Moltbook is a sign that machines are quietly mobilising against us, that’s probably reading too much into an early experiment rife with hype, human influence, and security holes.

We are building complex systems with limited oversight, and handing them weapons-grade access to our digital lives without fully understanding the consequences.

Moltbook may be a quirky experiment, or it may be a prototype for future agent ecosystems. But it’s not evidence of spontaneous machine consciousness or the birth of digital societies beyond human control.

What it is is a reminder that as AI grows more autonomous, the questions we need to ask are about governance, safety, and clarity, not apocalyptic narratives.

In other words: don’t panic. Just read the fine print before letting a legion of code-driven agents into your network.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Snowflake and OpenAI have struck a multi-year, $200 million partnership to bring OpenAI’s advanced models, including GPT-5.2, directly into Snowflake’s enterprise data platform. The collaboration is designed to let Snowflake’s large customer base, more than 12,000 organisations, build AI agents and semantic analytics tools that operate on their own data without moving it outside Snowflake’s governed environment.

Under the agreement, OpenAI models will be natively embedded in Snowflake Cortex AI and Snowflake Intelligence, making it possible to run queries, derive insights, and deploy AI-powered workflows using natural language interfaces and context-aware agents. Customers can analyse structured and unstructured data, automate complex tasks, and build applications grounded in enterprise data without needing extensive coding.

The deal expands Snowflake’s AI strategy beyond simple model access. By embedding these frontier models directly into its platform and making them available across major cloud providers, Snowflake aims to reduce the friction of AI adoption for large enterprises. Canva and WHOOP, among others, are already exploring how integrated agentic AI can speed up analytics and decision-making.

Snowflake’s stock reacted positively on the news, with shares climbing modestly following the announcement, as markets interpreted the agreement as a sign the data cloud provider is sharpening its competitive edge in an increasingly AI-centric landscape.

This partnership reflects a broader shift in enterprise AI beyond one-off integrations or bolt-on features. Instead, it signals a move toward platforms that combine governed data infrastructure with scalable generative AI models, helping businesses unlock insights and automate workflows without jeopardising security or compliance. Competitors such as Databricks are also intensifying their AI tooling efforts, underscoring how crucial native model access and data-centric AI capabilities have become in the enterprise race.

Taken together, this deal highlights an emerging pattern: enterprise AI is evolving from tool-centric add-ons to platform-level capabilities that unify data and intelligence at scale. Whether this will translate into sustained competitive advantage, or simply raise the baseline expectation for what AI-enabled data platforms must provide, is the next story to watch in the data cloud era.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">If you look at the press releases and breathless commentary around the recent acquisition of xAI by SpaceX, you might think we’re witnessing a tectonic shift in technological destiny.

A $1.25 trillion “mega-company” is born, poised to reshape artificial intelligence, space infrastructure, satellite internet, and possibly the fate of humanity itself. That narrative, enthusiastically repeated across headlines, serves a purpose: it frames a somewhat messy corporate consolidation as inevitable progress.

But let’s take a closer look and separate actual substance from Silicon Valley myth-making.

At its core, this acquisition solves one problem: xAI needed a place to spend its money. The startup that once raised billions and expanded by swallowing the social platform X was burning cash, an estimated very serious amount, chasing model performance and celebrity.

Folding it into SpaceX gives it access to a deeper capital pool, a broader story, and a more flattering valuation context.

TNW City Coworking space - Where your best work happens

A workspace designed for growth, collaboration, and endless networking opportunities in the heart of tech.

SpaceX did not acquire xAI because xAI was on the verge of overtaking tech giants in artificial intelligence. It acquired it because running a massively expensive AI operation inside a standalone startup wasn’t sustainable, even for Elon Musk’s legion of investors. A merger with a revenue-generating aerospace company looks a lot like a bailout disguised as synergy.

One of the dominant talking points from Musk’s own statements is that this consolidation enables space-based data centers, because apparently, earthbound power and cooling infrastructure are so last decade. The story goes: launch AI compute into orbit, agglomerate solar energy, and power the future with starlight.

On paper, it’s an imaginative riff. In practice, it’s strategic sci-fi for the markets. Putting data centers in space involves launch costs, radiation-hardened hardware, maintenance logistics that make ISS servicing look pedestrian, and no meaningful economy of scale compared to terrestrial hyperscalers like AWS or Google Cloud. If it were primarily about economics, the industry wouldn’t be scrambling to keep data on Earth.

The truth is simpler: this narrative reframes costly AI ambitions in a cosmic, venture-capital-friendly guise. It makes investors feel like they’re buying into a future where AI runs on sunshine in orbit, rather than into the present where AI training costs are a gating factor.

It’s good PR, dubious engineering economics.

The timing of this merger speaks volumes. SpaceX is preparing for a public offering, potentially as early as mid-2026. Reports say the combined entity could fetch valuations worth of $1.2 trillion.

Here’s what happens when you’re about to IPO:

You package your story in a way that excites both institutional and retail investors. You highlight future potential, especially grand visions like “ethereal solar compute.” You downplay structural weaknesses and uncertainties. And if you can fold in a shiny AI banner, all the better, because AI is the word that unlocks narrative premiums.

From that standpoint, SpaceX’s absorption of xAI makes sense. It’s narrative arbitrage: build a storyline that elevates the combination well beyond its standalone track records. Who wouldn’t want to invest in “AI in space,” even if the commercial case is mostly speculative?

If the goal was to create an AI powerhouse that actually threatens the likes of OpenAI, Google, or Anthropic, we’d see clear indicators: rapid model improvements, developer platform adoption, real enterprise deals, and benchmarks that are competitive on measurable terms.

What we see is an AI startup struggling to define its identity, a chatbot (Grok) known more for quirks and moderation issues than transformative performance, and a social platform that, let’s just say, gives fact-checking teams ulcers. None of this naturally scales into the kind of AI infrastructure leadership that justifies calling this a strategic technological fusion.

That’s not to say xAI has zero potential; it might. But there’s no verifiable evidence that this merger suddenly elevates it to tier-one AI contender status.

One striking consequence of this move is how deeply entwined Musk’s personal corporate empire has become. With SpaceX, xAI, Starlink, X, and multiple ventures all orbiting around the same figure, there’s little left that feels like a separate institution. That concentration raises questions about governance, accountability, and even regulatory scrutiny.

Musk’s critics have made this point before, whether about content moderation on social media platforms, intercompany transfers of resources, or governance decisions around publicly traded entities, and these concerns aren’t going away just because the companies now share a name on a term sheet.

Consolidation under one umbrella might be efficient from a control perspective, but it’s not inherently a prescription for innovation. In fact, it can stifle internal dissent, obscure accountability, and concentrate risk.

Again, there’s a clear pragmatic logic to this merger: xAI gets access to SpaceX’s balance sheet and a narrative boost; SpaceX gets an AI banner to highlight in its IPO pitch; investors get something that looks both futuristic and marketable.

That’s not a strategy grounded in technological merit. It’s a financial and narrative maneuver, carefully calibrated to appeal to markets and media.

In that sense, what just happened feels a lot like a bailout with a shiny new label and an extraterrestrial backstory.

If this were genuinely about advancing AI, we’d be hearing about:

None of those are the dominant themes of the current coverage. What we have instead is a $1.25 trillion headline and a promise that someday, somewhere, perhaps space will be the next frontier for AI compute.

It’s visionary in the way a concept car is visionary, exciting to look at, and flimsy on the economics.

The SpaceX-xAI merger is undeniably a headline-grabbing moment, but it’s not the strategic leap some commentators portray. It’s a capital and narrative optimization, not a clear answer to the question of who leads AI or how AI’s growth is sustainably powered.

If nothing else, it highlights how difficult it is to build a credible, well-funded AI company from scratch, even for someone as resourceful and celebrated as Elon Musk. His answer was not to reforge the fundamentals of AI research, but to fold an ambitious but unproven AI arm into a larger, more established aerospace machine with a glossy story that sounds like science fiction.

That may delight investors. It doesn’t yet convince technologists. Or me.

            <div id="article-text">OpenAI has given software developers a new desktop toy, and judging by the early reactions, it might feel like someone finally handed coders the Swiss Army knife they’ve been dreaming about or the kind of gadget that makes them wonder if they’re working with a robot coworker now.

The company rolled out the Codex app for macOS, a focused interface for managing AI coding agents, designed to let developers do more than just “generate a few lines of code.” Instead, Codex can juggle multiple tasks in parallel, run background workflows, and act on instructions that span hours or even days.

At its core, the new app is a response to a shift that’s been quietly happening for the past year: AI isn’t just helping write short snippets anymore. It’s taking on whole coding projects, running tests, dealing with pull requests, and even undertaking the kind of repetitive maintenance tasks that make developers groan.

Containers, threads, isolated worktrees, and integrated Git tools support all of this seamlessly within the app, so engineers don’t need to jump between terminals, IDEs, and cloud consoles just to keep a fleet of AI agents moving forward.

OpenAI’s own announcement makes this shift clear: existing tools were built for real-time interaction or single tasks, but today’s coding workflows are multifaceted and sprawling. Instead of coaxing a model to generate code line by line, the Codex app lets you orchestrate agents that work independently on different parts of a codebase.

Each agent runs in its own thread and its own worktree, which means you can explore multiple ideas without fear of one bot overwriting another’s progress. If you want Codex to review diffs, make comments inline, or even open suggested changes in your local editor, it can. If you want it to run in the background while you sleep, it can do that too.

Image: Screenshot shared on Reddit (r/singularity), original post.

There’s even support for what OpenAI calls “skills” and “automations”: reusable workflows that let Codex go beyond raw code generation into things like gathering information, problem solving, carrying out scheduled tasks, or managing routine reviews.

In early internal use cases, Codex has built complete applications, playing the roles of designer, developer, and QA tester in a single string of prompts, an example that hints at what happens when AI stops being an assistant and starts feeling a bit like a team member with infinite coffee.

It’s worth noting that the current release is macOS only, which prompted the usual chorus of developer grumbling about Windows and Linux support. Early adopters on Reddit (and elsewhere) joked that the lack of cross-platform availability feels oddly quaint for an AI tool, even as they praised how much the Codex app can do compared to traditional CLI workflows.

OpenAI is also sweetening the deal: for a limited time, Codex will be accessible to free and Go users, and rate limits for paid Plus, Pro, Business, Enterprise, and Edu plans have been doubled across all surfaces where Codex runs, whether that’s the app, the CLI, IDE extensions, or cloud threads.

The company’s broader strategy here is unmistakable. AI coding assistants are one of the most competitive battlegrounds in generative AI right now, and rivals like Anthropic’s Claude Code have already reported strong revenue metrics in this space.

The launch of a desktop command center for Codex feels like OpenAI saying, “We’re in this to win,” not just to ship features.

So what does this actually mean for developers? It doesn’t mean humans are about to be replaced overnight. Codex is powerful, but like all AI tools, it still makes mistakes and needs human oversight, especially when the stakes are high and production quality matters.

Seen through that lens, the Codex app is less a magic wand and more a powerful collaboration layer, one that could reshape how engineering teams operate without pretending to fully automate the craft of building software.

In practice, that suggests a near future where managing AI agents becomes as normal as managing packages or Git branches. Instead of the terminal being the center of your workflow, Codex and its agents might take that spot, responding to prompts, running scheduled tasks, and even adopting configurable “personalities” that fit how you prefer to work.

At a time when the debate around AI productivity often centers on displacement or disruption, the Codex app points in a more nuanced direction: what happens when coding tools become partners rather than assistants?

The answer won’t be immediate, and the work still demands human judgement, but for many developers the first glimpse of that future arrived today.
