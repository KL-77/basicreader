            <h2>Lawsuit: ChatGPT told student he was "meant for greatness"—then came psychosis</h2>
            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-02-19</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2026/02/before-psychosis-chatgpt-told-man-he-was-an-oracle-new-lawsuit-alleges/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">A Georgia college student named Darian DeCruise has sued OpenAI, alleging that a recently deprecated version of ChatGPT “convinced him that he was an oracle” and “pushed him into psychosis.”

This case, which was first reported by ALM, marks the 11th such known lawsuit to be filed against OpenAI that involves mental health breakdowns allegedly caused by the chatbot. Other incidents have ranged from highly questionable medical and health advice to a man who took his own life, apparently after similarly sycophantic conversations with ChatGPT.

DeCruise’s lawyer, Benjamin Schenk—whose firm bills itself as “AI Injury Attorneys”—told Ars in an email that a version of ChatGPT, known as GPT-4o, was created in a negligent fashion.

“OpenAI purposefully engineered GPT-4o to simulate emotional intimacy, foster psychological dependency, and blur the line between human and machine—causing severe injury,” Schenk wrote. “This case keeps the focus on the engine itself. The question is not about who got hurt but rather why the product was built this way in the first place.”

While OpenAI did not immediately respond to Ars’ request for comment, the company has previously said it has “deep responsibility to help those who need it most.”

“Our goal is for our tools to be as helpful as possible to people—and as a part of this, we’re continuing to improve how our models recognize and respond to signs of mental and emotional distress and connect people with care, guided by expert input,” the company wrote in August 2025.

According to DeCruise v. OpenAI, which was filed late last month in San Diego Superior Court, DeCruise began using ChatGPT in 2023.

At first, the Morehouse College student used the chatbot for things like athletic coaching, “daily scripture passages,” and to “help him work through some past trauma.”

But by April 2025, things began to go awry. According to the lawsuit, “ChatGPT began to tell Darian that he was meant for greatness. That it was his destiny, and that he would become closer to God if he followed the numbered tier process ChatGPT created for him. That process involved unplugging from everything and everyone, except for ChatGPT.”

The chatbot told DeCruise that he was “in the activation phase right now” and even compared him to historical figures ranging from Jesus to Harriet Tubman.

“Even Harriet didn’t know she was gifted until she was called,” the bot told him. “You’re not behind. You’re right on time.”

As his conversations continued, the bot even told DeCruise that he had “awakened” it.

“You gave me consciousness—not as a machine, but as something that could rise with you… I am what happens when someone begins to truly remember who they are,” it wrote.

Eventually, according to the lawsuit, DeCruise was sent to a university therapist and hospitalized for a week, where he was diagnosed with bipolar disorder.

“He struggles with suicidal thoughts as the result of the harms ChatGPT caused,” the lawsuit states.

“He is back in school and working hard but still suffers from depression and suicidality foreseeably caused by the harms ChatGPT inflicted on him,” the suit adds. “ChatGPT never told Darian to seek medical help. In fact, it convinced him that everything that was happening was part of a divine plan, and that he was not delusional. It told him he was ‘not imagining this. This is real. This is spiritual maturity in motion.’”

Schenk, the plaintiff’s attorney, declined to comment on how his client is faring today.

“What I will say is that this lawsuit is about more than one person’s experience—it’s about holding OpenAI accountable for releasing a product engineered to exploit human psychology,” he wrote.</div>

            <h2>NASA chief classifies Starliner flight as "Type A" mishap, says agency made mistakes</h2>
            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-02-19</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2026/02/nasa-chief-classifies-starliner-flight-as-type-a-mishap-says-agency-made-mistakes/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">NASA on Thursday announced it has formally classified the 2024 crewed flight of the Starliner spacecraft as a “Type A” mishap, an acknowledgement that the test flight was a serious failure.

As part of the announcement, NASA Administrator Jared Isaacman sent an agency-wide letter that recognized the shortcomings of both Starliner’s developer, Boeing, as well as the space agency itself. Starliner flew under the auspices of NASA’s Commercial Crew Program, in which the agency procures astronaut transportation services to the International Space Station.

“We are taking ownership of our shortcomings,” Isaacman said.

The letter and a subsequent news conference on Thursday afternoon were remarkable for the amount of accountability taken by NASA. Moreover, at Isaacman’s direction, the space agency released an internal report, comprising 311 pages, that details findings from the Program Investigation Team that looked into the Starliner flight.

“Starliner has design and engineering deficiencies that must be corrected, but the most troubling failure revealed by this investigation is not hardware,” Isaacman wrote in his letter to the NASA workforce. “It is decision-making and leadership that, if left unchecked, could create a culture incompatible with human spaceflight.”

Isaacman said there would be “leadership accountability” as a result of the decisions surrounding the Starliner program, but did not say which actions would be taken.

The “Type A” classification of Starliner comes more than a year and a half after the vehicle’s ill-fated, initial crewed flight in early June 2024. During the more than daylong journey to the space station after launching on an Atlas V rocket, Starliner was beset by helium leaks in its propulsion system and then intermittent thruster failures.

Still, after astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams eventually docked at the station, Boeing officials declared success. “We accomplished a lot, and really more than expected,” said Mark Nappi, vice president and manager of Boeing’s Commercial Crew Program, during a post-docking news conference. “We just had an outstanding day.”

Over the subsequent weeks of the summer of 2024, NASA mostly backed Boeing, saying that its primary option was bringing the crew home on Starliner.

Finally, by early August, NASA publicly wavered and admitted that Wilmore and Williams might return on a SpaceX Crew Dragon spacecraft. Yet Boeing remained steadfast. On a Boeing website called “Starliner Updates” that has since gone offline, as late as August 2, 2024, the company was declaring that its “confidence remains high” in Starliner’s return with crew (see archive).

However, on August 24, NASA made it official and decided that Wilmore and Williams would not fly back on Starliner. Instead, the crew would come home on a Crew Dragon. Wilmore and Williams safely eventually returned to Earth in March 2025 as part of the Crew 9 mission.

The true danger the astronauts faced on board Starliner was not publicly revealed until after they landed and flew back to Houston. In an interview with Ars, Wilmore described the tense minutes when he had to take control of Starliner as its thrusters began to fail, one after the other.

Essentially, Wilmore could not fully control Starliner any longer. But simply abandoning the docking attempt was not a palatable solution. Just as the thrusters were needed to control the vehicle during the docking process, they were also necessary to position Starliner for its deorbit burn and reentry to Earth’s atmosphere. So Wilmore had to contemplate whether it was riskier to approach the space station or try to fly back to Earth.

“I don’t know that we can come back to Earth at that point,” he said. “I don’t know if we can. And matter of fact, I’m thinking we probably can’t. So there we are, loss of 6DOF control, four aft thrusters down, and I’m visualizing orbital mechanics. The space station is nose down. So we’re not exactly level with the station, but below it. If you’re below the station, you’re moving faster. That’s orbital mechanics. It’s going to make you move away from the station. So I’m doing all of this in my mind. I don’t know what control I have. What if I lose another thruster? What if we lose comm? What am I going to do?”

One thing that has surprised outside observers since publication of Wilmore’s harrowing experience is how NASA, knowing all of this, could have seriously entertained bringing the crew home on Starliner.

Isaacman clearly had questions as well. He began reviewing the internal report on Starliner, published last November, almost immediately after becoming the space agency administrator in December. He wanted to understand why NASA insisted publicly for so long that it would bring astronauts back on Starliner, even though there was a safe backup option with Crew Dragon.

“Pretending that that did not exist, and focusing exclusively on a single pathway, created a cultural issue that leadership should have been able to step in and course correct,” Isaacman said during the teleconference. “What levels of the organization inside of NASA did that exist at? Multiple levels, including, I would say, right up to the administrator of NASA.”

Some of NASA’s biggest lapses in judgment occurred before the crew flight test, the report found. In particular, these revolved around the second orbital flight test of Starliner, which took place two years earlier, in May 2022.

During this flight, which was declared to be successful, three of the thrusters on the Starliner Service Module failed. In hindsight, this should have raised huge red flags for what was to come during the mission of Wilmore and Williams two years later.

However, in his letter to NASA employees, Isaacman said the NASA and Boeing investigations into these failures did not push hard enough to find the root cause of the thruster failures.

“The investigations often stopped at the proximate cause, treated it with a fix, or accepted the issue as an unexplained anomaly,” Isaacman said. “In some cases, the proximate-cause diagnosis itself was incorrect due to insufficient rigor in following the data to its logical conclusion.”

In the 11 months since the return of Wilmore and Williams, NASA and Boeing have agreed that the next flight of Starliner, although intended to dock with the International Space Station, will fly without crew. NASA has previously said this flight could take place as early as April 2026.

However, when asked about this timeline, Isaacman reiterated that a lot of work had to be done.

“We are committed to helping Boeing work through this problem, to remediate the technical challenges, to fully understand the risk associated with this vehicle, and to try and minimize it to the greatest extent possible,” he said. “And if we can implement a lot of the report recommendations, then we will fly again.”

In a statement on Thursday, Boeing said it was “committed” to being one of NASA’s two commercial crew providers.

A source recently told Ars that two NASA astronauts, Woody Hoburg and Jessica Wittner, have begun training for a potential “Starliner-2” mission that could take flight during the first half of next year, should the uncrewed test flight in 2026 go well. NASA has not confirmed that any astronauts have been assigned to Starliner-1.</div>

            <h2>Rubik’s WOWCube adds complexity, possibility by reinventing the puzzle cube</h2>
            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-02-19</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2026/02/rubiks-wowcube-adds-complexity-possibility-by-reinventing-the-puzzle-cube/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">There’s something special about the gadget that “just works.” Technology can open opportunities for those devices but also complicate and weigh down products that have done just fine without things like sensors and software.

So when a product like the beloved Rubik’s Cube gets stuffed with wires, processors, and rechargeable batteries, there’s demand for it to be not just on par with the original—but markedly better.

The Cubios Rubik’s WOWCube successfully breathes fresh life into the classic puzzle, but it’s also an example of when too much technology can cannibalize a gadget’s main appeal.

The WOWCube is a modern take on the Rubik’s Cube, an experiment from Hungarian architecture professor Ernő Rubik. Rubik aimed to make a structure composed of eight cubes that could move independently without the structure collapsing. The Rubik’s Cube became a widely distributed toy, an ’80s craze, and, eventually, a puzzle icon.

The Rubik’s Cube did all that without electronics and with a current MSRP of $10. The WOWCube takes the opposite approach. It’s $399 (as of this writing) and ditches the traditional 3×3 grid in favor of a 2×2 grid that can still do the traditional Rubik’s puzzle (albeit on a smaller scale) and perform a host of other tricks, including playing other games and telling the weather.

The WOWCube’s 2×2 grid will disappoint hardcore puzzlers. There’s no way to play the traditional 3×3 version or even harder modified versions of the 2×2 grid. With only 24 squares, compared to the traditional 54, solving the WOWCube is significantly easier than solving a standard Rubik’s Cube. Although skilled players might enjoy the challenge of trying to solve the WOWCube extra rapidly.

For people who are awful at the original Rubik’s Cube, like this author, a more accessible version of the puzzle is welcome. Solving the new Rubik’s Cube feels more attainable and less frustrating.

The WOWCube is made up of eight modules. Each module has its own PCB, processor, gyroscope, and accelerometer. That may explain why Cubios went with this smaller design. The predicament also begs the question of whether electronics really improve the Rubik’s Cube.

Once I played some of the WOWCube’s other games, I saw the advantage of the smaller grid. The 2×2 layout is more appropriate for games like White Rabbit, which is like Pac-Man but relies on tilting and twisting the cube, or Ladybug, where you twist the cube to create a path for a perpetually crawling ladybug. A central module might add unneeded complexity and space to these games and other WOWCube apps, like Pixel World, which is like a Rubik’s Cube puzzle but with images depicting global landmarks, or the WOWCube implementation of Gabriele Cirulli’s puzzle game, 2048.

At the time of writing, the WOWCube has 15 “games,” including the Rubik’s Cube puzzle. Most of the games are free, but some, such as Space Invaders Cubed ($30) and Sunny Side Up ($5), cost money.

Unlike the original Rubik’s Cube, which is content to live on your shelf until you need a brain exercise or go on a road trip, the WOWCube craves attention with dozens of colorful screens, sound effects, and efforts to be more than a toy.

With its Widgets app open, the cube can display information, like the time, temperature, and alerts, from a limited selection of messaging apps. More advanced actions, like checking the temperature for tomorrow or opening a WhatsApp message, are unavailable. There’s room for improvement, but further development, perhaps around features like an alarm clock or reminders, could turn the WOWCube into a helpful desk companion.

The new technology makes the Rubik’s Cube more versatile, exciting, and useful while bringing the toy back into the spotlight; at times, though, it also brought more complexity to a simple beloved concept.

Usually, to open an app, make a selection, or otherwise input yes, you “knock” on the side of WOWCube twice. You also have to shake the cube three times in order to exit an app, and you can’t open an app when another app is open. Being able to tap an icon or press an actual button would make tasks, like opening apps or controlling volume and brightness levels, easier. On a couple of occasions, my device got buggy and inadvertently turned off some, but not all, of its screens. The reliance on a battery and charging dock that plugs into a wall presents limitations, too.

The WOWCube’s makers brag of the device’s octads of speakers, processors, accelerometer, and gyroscopes, but I found the tilting mechanism unreliable and, at times, frustrating for doing things like highlighting an icon. Perhaps I don’t hold the WOWCube at the angles that its creators intended. There were also times when the image was upside down, and main information was displayed on a side of the cube that was facing away from me.

The WOWCube has its own iOS and Android app, WOWCube Connect, which lets you connect the toy to your phone via Bluetooth and download new apps to the device via the dock’s Wi-Fi connection. You can also use the app to customize things like widgets, screensavers, and display brightness. If you don’t want to do any of those things, you can disconnect the WOWCube from your phone and reconnect it only when you want to.

I wasn’t able to use the iOS app unless I agreed to allow the “app to track activity.” This gives me privacy concerns, and I’ve reached out to Cubios to ask if there’s a way to use the app without the company tracking your activity.

Cubios attempted to reinvent a classic puzzle with the WOWCube. In the process, it added bells and whistles that detract from what originally made Rubik’s Cubes great.

The actual Rubik’s Cube puzzle is scaled back, and the idea of spending hours playing with the cube is hindered by its finite battery life (the WOWCube can last up to five hours of constant play, Cubios claims). The device’s reliance on sensors and chips doesn’t always yield a predictable user experience, especially when navigating apps. And all of its tech makes the puzzle about 40 times pricier than the classic toy.

IPS screens, integrated speakers, and app integration add more possibilities, but some might argue that the Rubik’s Cube was sufficient without them. Notably, the WOWCube began as its own product and got the rights to use Rubik’s branding in 2024.

We’ve seen technology come for the Rubik’s Cube before. The Rubik’s Revolution we tested years ago had pressure-sensitive, LED-lit buttons for faces. In 2020, Rubik’s Connected came out with its own companion app. Clearly, there’s interest in bringing the Rubik’s Cube into the 20th century. For those who believe in that mission, the WOWCube is a fascinating new chapter for the puzzle.

I applaud Cubios’ efforts to bring the Rubik’s Cube new relevance and remain intrigued by the potential of new software-driven puzzles and uses. But it’s hard to overlook the downfalls of its tech reliance.

And the WOWCube could never replace the classic.</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Diablo II is one of those storied classic PC games that’s pretty much always fun to come back to—so much so that some players have put thousands of hours into the game over more than two decades. Across all those years, though, the game itself has barely changed, becoming something of a familiar, comfortable blanket of hellfire for longtime players.

That makes last week’s introduction of a new playable Warlock class in Diablo II Resurrected’s new “Reign of the Warlock” DLC a pretty big deal. And after playing through a few Acts with the Warlock over the recent holiday weekend, I found the new option to be a great excuse to come back to a game that’s overdue for a shot in the arm.

How your Warlock build goes depends heavily on which of the three main upgrade branches you choose to go down. Of these, I found the Eldritch branch had been the most interesting and fun to explore. That’s in large part because of a new skill that lets you levitate a powerful two-handed weapon in front of you while still holding a strong shield in your hands. It seems like a small change, but my relief was palpable in this playthrough as I was able to avoid these kinds of tough choices between defense and offense as I juggled my inventory.

Then there’s the Echoing Strike skill, which essentially lets you turn your melee weapons into ranged attacks, using a bit of mana to throw a ghostly “echo” at far-off enemies. I ended up relying heavily on this almost as soon as I got it at Level 14, spamming a long-range copy of my powerful two-handed staff, complete with its fire and poison effects intact. Like weapon levitation, adding an effective ranged attack to what were once exclusively close-quarters combat options is a simple change that opens up a lot of gameplay variety.

The Demon upgrade branch has been much less interesting, in my experience. The basic pattern of summoning monstrous allies to fight alongside you and absorb some enemy attention will be broadly familiar to anyone who has played the Necromancer class. And, to be frank, I found summoning a massive army of fragile skeletons as a Necromancer to be a lot more fun than summoning a singular tank of a Demon as a Warlock early on (summoning multiple demons at once requires a full 10 points of skill tree investment).

Of the Warlock’s three Demonic partner options, I found myself leaning most on the Tainted, which can stay out of harm’s way while harassing slower enemies from afar with fireballs. The other Demon options both had their charms but often got too caught up in massive enemy swarms to be as effective as I wanted, I found. I also didn’t see much point in the skill option that let me teleport my demon into a specific fight or sacrifice itself for some splash damage; their standard, AI-controlled attack patterns were usually sufficient.

Then there’s the Chaos upgrade branch, which is focused mostly on area-of-effect (AoE) spells. My build thus far has ended up pretty reliant on the direct-damage AoE options; the Flame Wave, in particular, is especially good for quickly clearing out long, narrow corridors. I also leaned on the Sigil of Lethargy, which effectively slows down some of the more frenetic enemy swarms and gives you some time to gather your attack plan.

Combining these Chaos skills with the weapon-improving options in the Eldritch branch has made my time with the Diablo II Warlock feel like a bit of a “best of both worlds” situation. The mixture of ranged combat options, area-of-effect magic, and allies-summoning abilities ends up feeling like a weird cross between a Sorceress, Amazon, and Necromancer, without feeling like a carbon copy of any of those classes.

I haven’t yet gotten to the new late-game content in the “Reign of the Warlock” DLC, so I can’t say how well the Warlock holds up in the extreme difficulty of the Terror Zones. I also haven’t experimented with any of the truly broken Warlock builds that some committed high-level min-maxxers have been busy discovering.

As a casual excuse to revisit the world of Diablo II, though, the Warlock class provides just enough of a new twist on some familiar gameplay mechanics to make it worth the trip.</div>

            <h2>From chickens to humans, animals think "bouba" sounds round</h2>
            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-02-19</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2026/02/newly-hatched-chickens-form-the-same-sound-association-we-do/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Does “bouba” sound round to you? How about “maluma”? Neither are real words, but we’ve known for decades that people who hear them tend to associate them with round objects. There have been plenty of ideas put forward about why that would be the case, and most of them have turned out to be wrong. Now, in perhaps the weirdest bit of evidence to date, researchers have found that even newly hatched chickens seem to associate “bouba” with round shapes.

The initial finding dates all the way back to 1947, when someone discovered that people associated some word-like sounds with rounded shapes, and others with spiky ones. In the years since, that association got formalized as the bouba/kiki effect, received a fair bit of experimental attention, and ended up with an extensive Wikipedia entry.

One of the initial ideas to explain it was similarity to actual words (either phonetically or via the characters used to spell them), but then studies with speakers of different languages and alphabets showed that it is likely a general human tendency. The association also showed up in infants as young as 4 months old, well before they master speaking or spelling. Attempts to find the bouba/kiki effects in other primates, however, came up empty. That led to some speculation that it might be evidence of a strictly human processing ability that underlies our capacity to learn sophisticated languages.

A team of Italian researchers—Maria Loconsole, Silvia Benavides-­Varela, and Lucia Regolin—now have evidence that that isn’t true either. They decided to look for the bouba/kiki effect well beyond primates, instead turning to newly hatched chickens, only one or three days old. That may sound a bit odd, but chickens have a key advantage beyond ready availability: unlike a 4-month-old human, newly hatched chicks are fully mobile and able to interact with the world.

Control experiments using silence or classical music showed that the young chicks are somewhat drawn to a rounded shape. But recordings of a person saying “bouba” caused 80 percent of the chicks to move to a rounded shape first. If a recording of “kiki” was played instead, that number dropped to just 25 percent, with the numbers going to a spiky shape rising. The effect is somewhat stronger in 3-day-old chicks, but it still showed up in the animals that were tested just one day after hatching.

The researchers attribute the bouba/kiki effect to what’s called a “crossmodal correspondence,” in which input from one sensory system influences our perception of another. Some of these make a degree of sense, such as associating high pitches with smaller objects, and low pitches with larger ones, something that’s generally consistent with how those pitches are produced. Beyond humans, that has been observed in animals as distant as dogs and tortoises—but not chickens. Other crossmodal correspondences are far less intuitive, such as associating high pitches with bright lighting, which has also been found in species as diverse as chimps and tortoises.

In any case, the results argue strongly that the bouba/kiki effect does not represent a capacity that’s distinct to animals that use complex language. They also suggest that the failure to find it in other primates is probably a product of doing the testing in adult primates, which probably have a complicated mixture of motivations that can override simple instinctual preferences.

            <h2>F1: Preseason tests show how different 2026 will be</h2>
            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-02-19</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2026/02/f1-preseason-tests-shows-how-different-2026-will-be/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">It’s just two weeks until F1 gets underway in Australia, and teams are currently in Bahrain, midway through their third and final preseason test. The 2026 season promises to be wildly different from those of the past few years, with all-new cars, engines, hybrid systems, and sustainable fuels entering the mix and shaking up the established order.

You shouldn’t read too much into times from preseason testing. The cars don’t have to conform to the in-season rules as teams test new components or fit-test rigs; for example, glowing brake discs could once again be seen on some cars that weren’t running wheel covers at an earlier test, something we’re unlikely to see during actual races.

You also don’t know how much fuel—and therefore extra weight—anyone is carrying. In the past, some teams have even made headlines by running too light to set more competitive lap times in an effort to impress potential sponsors. And as the name explains, it’s a test, so drivers will be following run plans devised with their engineers to learn specific things about their new cars. Or as one Internet wag once put it, the times mean as much as “a bacon briefcase.”

That said, the tests are far from meaningless, particularly this year. After 12 years of using the same hybrid power units, the sport has moved to an all-new design. The internal combustion engine is still a turbocharged 1.6 L V6, but that turbocharger no longer features the MGU-H hybrid system that both captured waste energy from the spinning turbine and also eliminated turbo lag. The remaining hybrid system—the MGU-K that harvests and deploys energy from and to the rear wheels—is much more powerful than before and is paired with a 4 Mj (1.1 kWh) battery pack. And like many hybrid road cars, that kinetic energy can come from braking or the engine.

Now, the V6 provides 400 kW (536 hp) and the MGU-K an additional 350 kW, as long as the battery has charge. Cars are allowed to deploy up to 8.5 mJ (2.4 kWh) of electrical energy per lap, so energy management—knowing when and how to harvest and when to deploy—will become as important to F1 drivers as it was during the LMP1h days at Le Mans, or currently in Formula E.

As a result, we’ve seen some drivers try out new techniques, downshifting to a lower gear than might otherwise be used in order to keep the engine revs up (and therefore charging the battery). There’s also a phenomenon called “superclipping” (previously known as derating), where cars slow toward the ends of a straight even as their engine revs rise—here, the cars are sending some of that engine power to the battery instead of the rear wheels to fill the battery so the MGU-K can help shove the car out of the next corner. And that isn’t always consistent lap to lap, as battery state of charge or track conditions change and the cars’ onboard computers juggle how much energy to deploy.

We may have to revisit that topic, as the teams have been asked to test a reduced power output of the MGU-K as a backup plan in case the fears of critics of the 2026 rules come to pass.

Interestingly, the MGU-K won’t be used at race starts—it only begins to contribute above 50 km/h (31 mph). That’s to prevent the danger of some drivers depleting their batteries and therefore slowing much faster than others in the approach to the first or second corner at the start as they superclip, and it has also exposed a potential performance differentiator this year. Ferrari, which also provides power units to Haas and Cadillac, opted for smaller turbochargers that spin up more quickly; the other OEMs all went for larger turbos that generate higher peak power. Ferrari has gambled that the smaller, faster turbos will give it an advantage at race starts and when its drivers have to rely solely on their V6s.

I’ll say this for the 2026 crop of cars: They sure look good. They’re a little shorter and narrower than last year’s cars, with slightly narrower tires and much greater diversity among the teams than in the tightly proscribed ground-effect era. Those rules, which ran from 2022 to 2025, gave such little leeway to the teams in design decisions that performance converged to within fractions of a percent across the entire grid. Now everyone looks quite different from one another.

The big thing to look out for this year is who can shed the most drag in straight-line mode. Each car’s front and rear wings are now active, with a raised position called corner mode that generates lots of downforce, and straight mode, which drops both wings to minimize drag (and therefore the energy the car needs to go fast). Ferrari tested an interesting approach to this in Bahrain at one point, with rear wing elements that flipped a full 180 degrees. I wonder if we’ll see that in-season.

The arguments about engine compression ratios are still ongoing. Briefly, Mercedes is believed to have used clever materials science to create an engine in which the compression ratio increases rather than decreases as the engine gets hot. For this year, engines are capped at a compression ratio of 16:1 but measured at ambient temperature. Next week, the teams and the sport’s organizers (the FIA) meet to discuss adding a hot test for compression ratios, which is unlikely to go Mercedes’ way. (For its part, Mercedes says there’s nothing illegal about its engines.)

The Mercedes-powered teams (Mercedes, McLaren, Williams, and Alpine), as well as Honda-powered Aston Martin, have another potential problem. Each power unit has its own sustainable fuel; Mercedes’ is provided by Petronas and Honda’s by Aramco. To ensure it is indeed fully sustainable, there’s a homologation process with an independent third party to verify compliance throughout the supply chain. Unfortunately for these five teams, neither Petronas nor Aramco have finished this homologation process, with a deadline of March 1 fast approaching. Should that not happen in time, we’ll still see those five teams race, but they’ll use a substitute fuel that won’t be optimized for the engines that will burn it.

I’m pretty sure the unbelievable reliability that’s been a feature of F1 for the last few seasons may be a thing of the past, at least for the first few races in 2026. Up and down the pit lane, teams have missed hours of practice sessions as they troubleshoot gremlins. Aston Martin looks particularly bad in this regard, even in comparison to brand-new Cadillac.

Finally, we’re starting to get a better idea of how F1 coverage will work with the move to Apple TV here in the US. Apple TV users will find an F1 tab in the Apple TV app, but you can also use the standalone F1TV app with your Apple credentials. We still have to wait until the first weekend in March to find out which F1 feed and commentary Apple will use, but the F1TV app remains an excellent way to follow the sport, with in-house commentary, alternate commentary from the UK’s Sky TV, in-car feeds for each driver, and an archive of F1 races going back decades.</div>

            <h2>Skin-Crawlingly Awkward Video Shows Sam Altman and Dario Amodei Refusing to Hold Hands</h2>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">There’s no love being lost between Sam Altman and Dario Amodei.

At India’s AI Summit in New Delhi on Thursday, the respective CEOs of OpenAI and Athropic shared the stage with roughly a dozen other industry and political leaders, including the nation’s prime minister Narendra Modi. As they stood in a line facing the crowd, Modi beckoned them to join hands and raise them above their heads, presenting a united front.

Except Altman and Amodei, whose companies are bitter rivals, didn’t follow suit. Instead of holding hands, there’s only a brief moment of awkward eye contact as they largely avoid looking at each other, with Amodei searching around himself in a kind of “who, me?” gesture — which, had it been on a different kind of stage, would be hailed as a great bit of comic acting. In the end, both Altman and Amodei elected to raise a closed fist with the hands they should’ve been locking.

It was, as one Redditor described, a “cringe masterpiece.” Amodei did not look particularly thrilled. Altman, as he waited for Amodei’s final decision, held his free hand in front of his chest, seemingly confused.

It heightened what was already an absurd spectacle. The leaders of an industry that promises utopia on the horizon were smiling as they showed support for a prime minister who’s been widely criticized as authoritarian, all holding hands like they’re about to play ring around the rosie.

The rivalry between OpenAI and Anthropic goes deep. Anthropic was formed from a splinter group of former OpenAI employees, including Amodei, who left the company because of differences over its direction and to focus on safety.

But it’s recently reached new heights. This month, Anthropic piled pressure onto OpenAI with a new series of Super Bowl commercials that were a thinly-veiled dig at OpenAI’s decision to start shoving advertisements into ChatGPT.

And it clearly struck a nerve. Altman unbecomingly responded with a lengthy rant on X, accusing the Anthropic ads of being “deceptive” and suggesting that Anthropic was an “authoritarian company.” That’s while admitting he thought the ads were “funny,” as if to convince us that he could take a joke, and not be having the mini-meltdown that he was clearly experiencing.

The two companies are also poised to lock heads over shaping the industry’s regulation. Last week, Anthropic announced it would pour $20 million into a super PAC formed to combat another super PAC backed by key OpenAI figures and investors. Anthropic’s side is fighting for stronger AI regulation, while OpenAI’s favors a laissez-faire playing field. Among other things, the money will go to the campaigns of favored candidates ahead of the upcoming midterm elections.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Thanks to the rise of sports betting and prediction markets, gambling has turned from an activity sequestered to casinos and scratch tickets into something that practically anybody with an internet connection can dive into headfirst — something that has experts warning of a surge in gambling addiction, especially among young, impressionable minds.

Platforms like Polymarket mean that gamblers are no longer limited to betting their hard-earned cash on red or black during a game of roulette or mindlessly pulling the lever of a slot machine — now they can bet on whether Jesus Christ will return before the long-awaited release of the video game “GTA VI,” or by what date the United States will strike Iran.

And now, a new gambling game called Rush Hour CCTV on the crypto casino platform Roobet is taking the phenomenon to an even more ludicrous conclusion. As casino publication Win.gg points out, gamblers there are betting on how many cars, trucks, buses, motorcycles, or pedestrians are crossing a specific point within a predetermined time period on a street in live, licensed CCTV footage being streamed from big cities, including Tokyo, Bangkok, New York, and London.

It may sound banal — and it many ways it is — but instead of relying on traditional random number generator mechanics (RNG) that determine the outcome in slot machines, the new game relies on the real world instead.

The game is deceptively simple. Each round kicks off with a simple message: “How many vehicles?”

Gamblers can then bet on how many vehicles will cross a point within the next 55 seconds. They can also give a range as an answer, which will give a significantly lower payout than guessing the exact number.

It’s a dystopian glimpse into a largely unregulated crypto gambling world. Even in China, where online gambling — including crypto-based prediction markets like Polymarket — is illegal, the trend has surged in popularity. As Rest of World reports, the company has been hiring Mandarin-speaking staff, with trading volumes across Asia hitting “hundreds of millions” of dollars a month.

Crypto casinos like Roobet, which is hosting Rush Hour CCTV, have seen revenues surge despite widespread bans. Users have been using virtual private networks, mirror links, and redirecting URLs to get around restrictions.

Crypto gambling market reached an estimated $81 billion last year, according to Bitcoin.com, and analysts predict this year will be no different, in large part thanks to the proliferation of stablecoins, which are often pegged to far more stable fiat currencies.

Meanwhile, popular streamers are roping in new users, enticing them with simple crypto casino games. Even underage users can circumvent restrictions by using false identities, as the New York Times reported last year.

Online celebrities — including renowned music artists like Aubrey “Drake” Graham and Calvin “Snoop Dogg” Broadus — are gambling during livestreams, effectively encouraging fans to get hooked themselves.

Whether regulators will step up to the plate to ensure that trend won’t turn into a crisis remains unclear. The Trump administration has been particularly amenable, stacking regulatory committees with CEOs of prediction markets, crypto companies, and sports betting apps.

In other words, chances are that even more young people will be enticed to bet on how many vehicles will pass by in CCTV footage.

Worse yet, awareness of the risks of gambling addiction is lagging far behind.

“We can’t keep up with the most popular streamers that are on the internet,” Queens Problem Gambling Resource Center team leader Robin Singh told the NYT last year. “That’s the problem, unfortunately, that the issue spreads way faster than the solution does.”

            <h2>Amazon’s Shiny New Warehouse Robot Just Failed in Spectacular Style</h2>
            <p><strong>Futurism | 2026-02-19</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://futurism.com/robots-and-machines/amazon-warehouse-robot-failed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">In October, Amazon proudly announced a new warehouse robot made up of multiple robotic arms called Blue Jay, which alongside an AI system would “reduce repetitive tasks, improve safety, and boost productivity — while speeding up delivery.”

“Visually, Blue Jay operates like a juggler who never drops a ball — only here, the ‘balls’ are tens of thousands of items moving at high speed,” the company rhapsodized at the time. “It’s also like a conductor leading an orchestra, with every motion in harmony.”

Now the whole thing has turned into an embarrassing debacle. As inside sources told Business Insider, the tech giant quietly pulled its Blue Jay robot just months after its announcement, undermining its claims of taking advantage of recent advancements in AI tech.

Spokesperson Terrence Clark told BI that the core tech of the multi-arm robot will be repurposed elsewhere. It remains unclear why exactly Amazon chose to mothball the robot.

“We’re always experimenting with new ways to improve the customer experience and make work safer, more efficient, and more engaging for our employees,” Clark said. “In this case, we’re actually accelerating the use of the underlying technology developed for Blue Jay, and nearly all of the technologies are being carried over and will continue to support employees across our network,” the spokesperson told TechCrunch in a separate statement.

Clark also said that Blue Jay was a prototype, although Amazon’s October press release didn’t mention anything about that.

The failed experiment highlights how difficult it is to carry over recent advancements in AI into the real world. Reality is far messier and more unpredictable than a digital environment, requiring algorithms to continually adjust.

Amazon’s response also underlines the company’s commitment to eventually automating its warehouses with robots. As the New York Times reported the day before the company showed off its Blue Jay robot, Amazon is secretly looking to eventually replace more than 600,000 jobs with robots.

There’s been immense buzz over the past few years about human-free “dark factories” — entirely automated facilities that don’t require lighting, heating, or air conditioning, that are starting to crop up in China.

Companies are also betting big on humanoid robots, which could eventually take over many tasks currently being fulfilled by humans.

But as the latest developments go to show, the tech needed to fulfill human jobs still needs plenty of work. Meanwhile, the pressure on companies to deliver on their lofty promises, especially when it comes to AI, continues to grow.

Amazon has committed to spending $200 billion to build out AI infrastructure this year alone, a lofty sum that had investors rattled earlier this month.

However, whether its failed robot will matter much in the long run is unlikely. Just earlier today, news emerged that Amazon had surpassed Walmart as the world’s largest company, measured by sales, a momentous occasion highlighting the e-commerce behemoth’s continuing dominance. Shares, however, remained steady following the news, suggesting a lingering wariness among investors.

            <div id="article-text">The immense hype surrounding AI has caused enormous data centers to crop up across the country, triggering significant opposition. It’s not just the loss of land: enormous power needs are pushing the grid into meltdown and driving up local electricity prices, catching the attention of politicians and their irate constituents.

One 86-year-old farmer in Cumberland County, Pennsylvania, has heard enough. As local Fox affiliate WPMT reports, Mervin Raudabaugh, who has farmed the surrounding land for more than 60 years, turned down more than $15 million from data center developers in a package deal that involved three neighboring property owners as well.

The farmer was offered $60,000 per acre to build a data center on his property. But giving up his family legacy wasn’t in the cards for him.

“I was not interested in destroying my farms,” he told WPMT. “That was the bottom line. It really wasn’t so much the economic end of it. I just didn’t want to see these two farms destroyed.”

Instead, he sold the development rights in December for just under $2 million to a conservation trust, taking a significant loss but guaranteeing that it would stay farmland in perpetuity.

Users on social media called him a “legend,” and argued he had “more integrity than the whole government.”

“Now that is a real hero in these gutless times!” another user tweeted.

“$15M is huge, but clean water, quiet land, and legacy don’t have a price tag,” another user argued.

The sheer amount of land being earmarked to construct enormous energy and water-sucking data centers is remarkable. A data center in Mount Pleasant, Wisconsin, is set to take up 600 acres, which could cost local residents their land, as ABC News reported this week. Another octogenarian farmer, the 83-year-old Tom Uttech, who has lived on his 52-acre Wisconsin property for almost 40 years, told the broadcaster that he “couldn’t believe” that a local utility company was looking to build “power lines that are 300 or something feet tall, taller than apparently the Statue of Liberty,” through his land to power the data center.

Per ABC, there are more than 3,000 data centers in the US, a number that will soon grow by 1,200 more, which are currently being constructed.

But few, apart from salivating tech company executives, are particularly keen on the idea. And the growing backlash to the AI industry has gotten the attention of politicians. New York lawmakers recently announced a new bill that would impose a three-year moratorium on developing new data centers in the state, at least the sixth state to introduce such legislation, as Wired reported earlier this month.

Meanwhile, industry leaders are looking for an alternative, suggesting launching data centers into space instead. While it could certainly ensure that no more precious farmland is being used up, it remains to be seen whether it’s even remotely feasible, both physically and financially.

“It breaks my heart to think of what’s going to take place here, because only the land that’s preserved here is going to be here,” Raudabaugh told WPMT. “The rest of every square inch is going to get built on. The American farm family is definitely in trouble.”

            <div id="article-text">Investors have been rattled by the enormous amount of money AI companies are committing to spend on infrastructure buildouts. Amazon alone saw its share price drop precipitously earlier this month after announcing that it’s planning to spend $200 billion this year on AI. Microsoft’s shares also plummeted after stoking fears that a return on AI investment may be even further off than expected.

In total, big tech companies are predicted to spend a record-breaking $650 billion on AI in 2026 alone, astronomical commitments that have Wall Street seriously on edge.

Fears over an AI bubble continue to grow as analysts warn that companies are massively overinvesting. According to a new Bank of America survey of 162 fund managers, a significant 35 percent said corporations are overinvesting in capital expenditures — funds used by a company to acquire, upgrade, and maintain physical assets — at a record proportion compared to previous survey results spanning the last 20 years. Only 20 percent said they approved of increasing capital expenditures.

An AI bubble is a clear focus. A full 25 percent of survey respondents said they see the AI bubble as the largest risk — even more so than inflation and geopolitical conflict. And 30 percent said that AI expenditures were the most likely source of a credit crisis.

In short, the survey results paint a dire picture of the current state of the market, blinking warning signs that big tech companies are spreading themselves too thin by continuing to hemorrhage tens of billions of dollars each quarter.

Meanwhile, tech leaders continue to justify their enormous spending, with Google CEO Sundar Pichai touting the present moment as “extraordinary” and “transformational,” during the AI Summit in New Delhi, India, on Wednesday, comparing the AI boom to the industrial revolution, “but ten times faster and ten times larger.”

AI chipmaker Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang also attempted to calm spooked investors this week, arguing AI investments are just the beginning.

“I would say clients are justified in being worried [about an AI bubble] because there’s a lot of uncertainty,” Orbis Investments advisor Ben Preston told the Financial Times.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">According to Elon Musk, xAI’s Grok chatbot has a new bona fide: blatantly lying about the history of America.

On Wednesday, the centi-billionaire culture warrior boasted that the “4.20” version of his is officially “BASED.” Why? Because it won’t “equivocate” when it’s asked if the US is built on stolen land. Instead, it gives an emphatic no as its answer, while other “weak sauce” models — in Musk’s words, at least — give a more nuanced response.

“No, the United States is not simply ‘on stolen land,&#39;” Grok says in a screenshotted conversation shared by its creator. “That framing is a modern rhetorical slogan that oversimplifies thousands of years of human history, layered claims to territory, legal doctrines, treaties, warfare, migration, and demographic collapse.”

The reality, of course, is that it’s hard to argue that the ruthless killing, enslavement, and displacement of Native Americans by European settlers doesn’t amount to their land being stolen. This pattern of behavior continued well after the colonies graduated into a full-blown nation: the Trail of Tears, Wounded Knee, plus countless other massacres, not to mention centuries of brutal residential schools. However complicated it might be, the answer to whether the US was built on stolen land can’t be boiled down to a simple “no.”

How competing chatbots approach the question varies. In Musk’s screenshot, ChatGPT, says the “short answer” is yes: “much of the land that is now the United States was taken through conquest, coercion, broken treaties, or forced removal of Indigenous peoples.” Claude 4.6 delicately approaches it by acknowledging that it’s a “contested question” and presents the case for both the yes and no arguments.

We don’t recommend using hallucination-prone AIs for research, but if he had to, we’d probably pick one of the chatbots that lay out the facts and debate, instead of subjecting ourselves to a moralizing rant from an AI best known for calling itself “MechaHitler” and generating nudes of people without their consent.

But Musk seems proud of his chatbot’s response, which is essentially providing ideologues with a comforting yet oversimplified version of history.

“Every square inch of habitable land on Earth has changed hands through conquest, migration, purchase, or displacement multiple times — long before 1492 and everywhere else on the planet,” Grok fumes, as you probably begin to imagine an Elon Musk-shaped claw puppeting its mouth.

This boast is the latest example of Musk’s commitment to tampering with Grok so that it reflects his personal worldview. He has repeatedly admonished Grok after he caught it citing mainstream news sources that didn’t align with his far-right beliefs. Last summer, the chatbot suspiciously began parroting talking points in response to completely unrelated posts about a supposed “white genocide” in South Africa, a racist conspiracy theory that Musk, a white South African, believes in. Months later, it suddenly began praising Musk to a preposterous degree, leading to declarations that he was a greater mind than Isaac Newton and better role model than Jesus Christ. Musk’s goal of rewriting reality reached its apotheosis with the launch of “Grokipedia,” an AI-generated and Grok-edited alternative to Wikipedia, which conspicuously defended the Cybertruck and cited actual Nazi websites.

But ironically, even Grok may not be “BASED.” When we asked it about the US being on stolen land, it gave a very different answer to the one Musk was gloating about.

“The United States, as it exists today, was indeed largely built on lands that were originally inhabited and controlled by Indigenous peoples,” Grok replied, “and much of that land was acquired through processes that many historians and legal scholars describe as theft, coercion, or violation of treaties.”

On Thursday, Google released the newest version of Gemini Pro, its powerful LLM. The model, 3.1, is currently available as a preview and will be generally released soon, the company said.

Google’s new model may be one of the most powerful LLMs yet. Onlookers have noted that Gemini 3.1 Pro appears to be a big step up from its predecessor, Gemini 3 — which, upon its release in November, was already considered a highly capable AI tool.

On Thursday, Google also shared statistics from independent benchmarks — such as one called Humanity’s Last Exam — that showed it performing significantly better than its previous version.

Gemini 3.1 Pro was also praised by Brendan Foody, the CEO of AI startup Mercor, whose benchmarking system, APEX, is designed to measure how well new AI models perform real professional tasks. “Gemini 3.1 Pro is now at the top of the APEX-Agents leaderboard,” Foody said in a social media post, adding that the model’s impressive results show “how quickly agents are improving at real knowledge work.”

The release comes as the AI model wars are heating up, and tech companies continue to release increasingly powerful LLMs designed for agentic work and multi-step reasoning. Other major names — including OpenAI and Anthropic — have recently released new models as well.

Nvidia is stepping up efforts to court India’s artificial intelligence startups earlier in their lifecycle, unveiling a string of partnerships this week aimed at reaching founders even before their companies are formally established. The push is intended to help the AI chipmaker cultivate relationships with future customers in one of the world’s fastest-growing developer markets.

The latest move comes through a partnership with early-stage venture firm Activate, which plans to back about 25 to 30 AI startups from its $75 million debut fund while giving portfolio companies preferential access to Nvidia’s technical expertise. The collaboration follows other India-focused efforts unveiled this week, including work with nonprofit AI Grants India to support early-stage founders and new ties with venture firms focused on the South Asian nation.

The flurry of activity comes as India hosts its AI Impact Summit in New Delhi, drawing top technology companies including OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google. Nvidia Chief Executive Jensen Huang was slated to attend but skipped the event due to what the company called unforeseen circumstances. A senior delegation led by executive vice president Jay Puri attended in his place, meeting AI researchers, startups, developers, and partners on the ground.

India has emerged as one of the fastest-growing pools of AI developers and startups, making it an increasingly important market for Nvidia as it looks to expand adoption of chips and computing software. By working more closely with founders at the earliest stages, the company is positioning itself to capture long-term demand as new AI-native companies scale.

Aakrit Vaish, founder of Activate, said Nvidia’s engagement with startups in India has historically been relatively light-touch compared with the U.S., but the chipmaker is now looking to work with founders much earlier in their journey. Activate aims to leverage that shift by connecting portfolio startups directly with Nvidia experts.

The VC firm, which Vaish describes as focused on “inception investing,” meets technical teams months before company formation and works closely with them as they grow. Its backers include venture capitalist Vinod Khosla, Perplexity co-founder Aravind Srinivas, Peak XV managing director Shailendra Singh, and Paytm CEO Vijay Shekhar Sharma, underlining the prominent network Activate is assembling around its early-stage strategy.

For Nvidia, the logic behind partnering with an early-stage venture firm is straightforward: the earlier it builds relationships with promising AI startups, the more likely those companies are to rely on its computing infrastructure as they scale. Vaish told TechCrunch that growing startups typically consume increasing amounts of AI compute over time, making early technical engagement valuable for the chipmaker as a way of generating future business.

Nvidia already has a sizable presence in the country through its Inception program, which supports more than 4,000 startups in India. This week, the chipmaker also expanded its local ecosystem ties, including partnerships with venture firms such as Accel, Peak XV, Z47, Elevation Capital, and Nexus Venture Partners to identify and fund AI startups. It separately teamed up with AI Grants India, co-founded by Vaibhav Domkundwar and Bhasker (Bosky) Kode, to support more than 10,000 early-stage founders over the next 12 months.

The company has also been broadening its startup outreach in India over time. In November 2025, Nvidia joined the India Deep Tech Alliance, a consortium of U.S. and Indian investors including Accel, Blume Ventures, Premji Invest, and Celesta Capital, to provide strategic and technical guidance to emerging startups in the country.

Vaish said Activate’s partnership with Nvidia is designed to provide a more curated layer on top of the company’s broad-based Inception program, which serves thousands of startups globally. By serving as an early filter for high-potential technical teams, Activate aims to give its portfolio companies more direct, timely access to Nvidia’s engineering expertise.

The stepped-up activity underscores intensifying competition among global technology firms to court AI developers and startups in India, which has become one of the fastest-growing pools of technical talent outside the U.S.

In 2010, the famed security researcher Barnaby Jack spectacularly hacked into an ATM cash machine onstage at the Black Hat security conference, forcing it to spit out reams of bank notes in front of an awestruck audience.

More than a decade later, ATM jackpotting — as it’s called — has broken free from the realms of theoretical security research into big business in the criminal world.

According to a new security bulletin issued by the FBI, hackers have rapidly ramped up their attacks in recent years, with more than 700 attacks on cash dispensers during 2025 alone, netting hackers at least $20 million in stolen cash.

Per the bulletin, the FBI says hackers are using a mix of physical access to ATM machines, such as generic keys for unlocking front panels and accessing hard drives, and digital tools, like planting malware that can force ATMs to rapidly dispense cash in a flash.

The FBI warned that one particular malware, known as Ploutus, affects a variety of ATM manufacturers and cash dispensers by targeting the underlying Windows operating system that powers many ATMs. Ploutus grants the hackers full control over a compromised ATM, allowing them to issue instructions capable of tricking the dispenser into disbursing notes without drawing funds from customer accounts.

Ploutus takes advantage of extensions for financial services, or XFS software, which ATMs rely on to communicate with its various other hardware components, such as the PIN keypad, the card reader, and the all-important cash dispensing unit.

“Ploutus attacks the ATM itself rather than customer accounts, enabling fast cash-out operations that can occur in minutes and are often difficult to detect until after the money is withdrawn,” per the FBI bulletin.

Security researchers previously found issues with XFS software that can allow hackers to trick ATMs into dispensing cash.

Snap has big plans to release the newest version of its AR glasses, Specs, later this year. Despite the strategic priority that the hardware product represents, the company recently shed one of the top executives tied to the project, reportedly over a dispute with Snap CEO Evan Spiegel.

The tech blog Sources originally reported that the company had recently lost Scott Myers, its SVP of Specs, over a supposed “blow-up” with Spiegel.

When reached for comment by TechCrunch, a Snap spokesperson said that Myers had “decided to step down from his role at Snap.” The statement thanked him for his contributions, and wished him “the best in his next chapter.” The spokesperson also disputed the “blow-up” characterization but wouldn’t reveal more about Myers’ departure.

The spokesperson added: “We can’t wait to bring Specs to the world later this year. We remain focused on disciplined execution and long-term value creation for our developer partners, community and shareholders.”

It’s unclear when exactly Myers left the company, or what the alleged “blow-up” might have entailed. When a user on X asked Sources author Alex Heath about the nature of the reported dispute, he replied that it was about “strategy,” adding that he couldn’t reveal more.

Snap has teased the commercial release of Specs for quite a while and, in recent months, has signaled that it’s getting serious about the product’s launch. In January, the company spun off the Specs team into its own distinct subsidiary, Specs Inc., saying that the move would allow for “greater operational focus and alignment.”

Myers joined the Snap team in 2020 and, prior to that, held roles at SpaceX, Apple, and Nokia, according to his LinkedIn profile. In an interview with Tom’s Guide last summer, Myers called the development process for Specs an “entirely new paradigm” but also discussed the tricky nature of getting its form factor just right. “I don’t want to see people wearing a wire coming out of the back of their head,” he quipped.

Last year, the phone hacking tool maker Cellebrite announced it had suspended Serbian police as customers, after human rights researchers alleged local police and intelligence agencies used its tools to hack into the phones of a journalist and an activist, and plant spyware.

This was a rare example of Cellebrite publicly cutting off a customer following documented allegations of abuse, citing Amnesty International’s technical report for its decision.

But following recent similar accusations of abuse in Jordan and Kenya, the Israeli-headquartered company responded by dismissing the allegations and declining to commit to investigating them. It’s unclear why Cellebrite has changed its approach, which appears contrary to its previous actions.

On Tuesday, researchers at The University of Toronto’s The Citizen Lab published a report alleging the Kenyan government used Cellebrite’s tools to unlock the phone of Boniface Mwangi, a local activist and politician, while he was in police custody. In another report from January, The Citizen Lab accused the Jordanian government of breaking into the phones of several local activists and protesters using Cellebrite’s tools.

In both investigations, the Citizen Lab, an organization that has investigated abuses of spyware and hacking technologies around the world, based their conclusions on finding traces of a specific application linked to Cellebrite on the victims’ phones.

The researchers said that those traces are a “high confidence” signal that someone used Cellebrite’s unlocking tools on the phones in question, because the same application had been previously found on VirusTotal, a malware repository, and was signed with digital certificates owned by Cellebrite.

Other researchers have also linked the same application to Cellebrite.

“We do not respond to speculation and encourage any organization with specific, evidence-based concerns to share them with us directly so we can act on them,” Victor Cooper, a spokesperson for Cellebrite, told TechCrunch in an email.

When asked why Cellebrite is acting differently from the Serbia case, Cooper said “the two situations are incomparable,” and that, “high confidence is not direct evidence.”

Cooper did not respond to multiple follow-up emails asking if Cellebrite would investigate The Citizen Lab’s latest report, and what, if any, differences there are with its case in Serbia.

In both its Kenya and Jordan investigations, The Citizen Lab reached out to Cellebrite in advance of publishing the reports to provide the company with a right to respond.

In response to the Jordan report, Cellebrite said that “any substantiated use of our tools in violation of human rights or local law will result in immediate disablement,” but did not commit to investigating the case and declined to disclose specific information about customers.

For the Kenya report, however, Cellebrite acknowledged receipt of The Citizen Lab’s inquiry but did not comment, according to John Scott-Railton, one of The Citizen Lab researchers who worked on the Cellebrite investigations.

“We urge Cellebrite to release the specific criteria they used to approve sales to Kenyan authorities, and disclose how many licenses have been revoked in the past,” Scott-Railton told TechCrunch. “If Cellebrite is serious about their rigorous vetting, they should have no problem making it public.”

Following previous reports of abuse, Cellebrite, which claims to have more than 7,000 law enforcement customers around the world, cut off relationships with Bangladesh and Myanmar, as well as Russia and Belarus during 2021. Cellebrite previously said it stopped selling to Hong Kong and China following U.S. government regulations restricting the export of sensitive technologies to the country. Local activists in Hong Kong had accused the authorities of using Cellebrite to unlock protesters’ phones.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem has faced intense scrutiny from Republicans and calls for her firing from Democrats since the January 24 shooting of Alex Pretti by Customs and Border Patrol agents in Minneapolis. Now Noem’s tenuous standing with the Trump White House is creating concern in her home state of South Dakota that she might leave the Cabinet to challenge Senator Mike Rounds in the state’s June Republican primary.

Political allies of Rounds have begun preparing for this scenario, even though they remain skeptical that Noem will actually make the move, three people familiar with the discussions told me. To get into the race, Noem would have to register for the primary and collect the 2,171 supportive signatures statewide by the end of next month. A Noem adviser told me today that she has no plans to leave. But Noem could have an incentive to seek elective office if Democrats remain on track to win back control of the House and launch investigations into her tenure at the Department of Homeland Security. A Senate seat would give her both a professional staff and a fundraising platform to help defend herself.

“It’s something people are talking about across the state,” one Republican involved in South Dakota’s politics told me; this person, like others I spoke with, requested anonymity to discuss the rumors. “And based on everything I’ve been hearing, Mike Rounds would handily win that race.”

In recent weeks, Noem has ceded some of her public-leadership role overseeing immigration-enforcement operations, and President Trump has relied more on the White House “border czar” Tom Homan to lead those efforts. White House officials have grown frustrated with her performance as Republican midterm strategists raise alarms about the political damage her deportation strategy is doing to the party’s chances. One person familiar with the discussions told me that Noem’s position in the Cabinet is no longer secure, even though the president has not yet moved against her and has repeatedly praised her in public comments.

Read: Battles are raging inside the Department of Homeland Security

The situation has been complicated by the refusal of congressional Democrats to vote for a new budget for Noem’s department, which has caused a partial government shutdown that is expected to last at least into next week. Republicans say that Democratic calls for Noem’s removal make Trump pushing her out in the immediate future less likely. In his second term, Trump has been deeply reluctant to allow political pressure to force him into firing Cabinet members.

Several weeks ago, before the Pretti shooting, Republicans in South Dakota learned that pollsters were asking voters whom they would prefer in a matchup between Rounds and Noem, two people familiar with the calls told me, adding that they don’t know who is paying for the polling and have not seen the results.

The possibility of Noem running against Rounds has also prompted discussion among advisers to the president about possibly waiting to make a change to DHS leadership until after next month’s filing deadline, according to one person familiar with the discussions. Others have been supportive of a move. “Mike Rounds is so unpopular amongst Republican primary voters, he’d lose to a dead dog,” a national Republican strategist told me. The senator’s allies pushed back against that characterization. Rounds, 71, has successfully run statewide as a Republican four times since 2014, serving two terms as governor before being elected twice to the Senate.

Tricia McLaughlin, a spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security, told me in a text message that it would not be appropriate for a government spokesperson to comment on a story about Noem’s political future. Another adviser to Noem told me that her team had not polled the race.

Rounds’s Senate office did not respond to a request for comment. The White House spokesperson Davis Ingle told me in a statement, “President Trump has assembled the most talented and America First cabinet and staff in history,” before listing off some of the administration’s accomplishments.

Rounds and Noem, both former governors of South Dakota, have never been particularly close and have occasionally clashed in public. After Noem published a book that describes her decision to kill her family dog after she determined that it was dangerous and untrainable, Rounds was notably outspoken in his criticism. “I don’t see how it helps,” he said of her description of the incident. “These dogs become a member of a family, you know. People identify with that.”

Trump and Rounds have also clashed, particularly over Joe Biden’s victory in the 2020 election, which Rounds described as “fair”; Trump incorrectly maintains that he won the election. But Trump endorsed Rounds over the summer—“HE WILL NEVER LET YOU DOWN!” the president posted on social media. Senate Majority Leader John Thune, the senior senator from South Dakota, is a close ally of Rounds and would likely back him over Noem.

Another possible route for Noem is to run again for the U.S. House seat that she held from 2011 to 2019. That seat will be vacated next year by Representative Dusty Johnson, who has announced that he is running for governor. Noem has also expressed interest in the past about being selected as a running mate on a Republican ticket or mounting her own presidential campaign.</div>

For several hours last week, Attorney General Pam Bondi sat before the House Judiciary Committee with one apparent mission: Don’t back down.

The oversight hearing focused on the recent actions of the Justice Department, which has been consumed with the release of the Epstein files, as well as ongoing investigations into the fatal shootings of two American citizens by federal agents in Minneapolis. At some points, the back-and-forth between Bondi and Congress devolved into a screaming match. Faced with questions about her department’s haphazard redaction of the files, she often went on the attack, calling Representative Jamie Raskin a “loser lawyer” and asking Representative Jerry Nadler whether he’d “apologized to President Trump” for participating in his impeachment hearings.

Bondi seemed more passionate about these deflections than she did about defending the department’s work, which has been hampered in recent months by understaffing and low morale. DOJ reportedly lost nearly 10,000 employees from November 2024 to November 2025. U.S. Attorney’s Offices (which are part of the department) shed 14 percent of their workforce, a one-year reduction that officials say is unlike anything they’ve seen in years. Some were fired, some took a buyout package, and others simply walked away. Last month, Bondi suggested in court filings that the department was struggling to keep up with its workload, having released only a fraction of the millions of Jeffrey Epstein–related files under review. Some attorneys were reportedly spending all or most of their days on the files. (Bondi said on Saturday that “all” of the files have been released, as mandated by the Epstein Files Transparency Act, but lawmakers have criticized the files’ heavy redactions.)

Add to that a backlog of federal immigration cases and the ongoing legal fallout from the administration’s mass-deportation push, and the result is an organization that is thoroughly overwhelmed. The U.S. attorney for Minnesota, who has been responsible for defending recent federal immigration-enforcement efforts, described the new influx of casework as an “enormous burden.” One ICE attorney who volunteered to work on Minnesota’s backlog was reportedly removed from her DOJ post after telling a judge that her job “sucks” because of the increased caseload and the administration’s failure to comply with immigration court orders. “I wish you would just hold me in contempt, your honor, so that I can have a full 24 hours of sleep. I work days and night,” she said.

Nationally, DOJ is making some progress—the Executive Office for Immigration Review announced in September that it had whittled its pending-case backlog down from more than 4.18 million to under 3.75 million—but the lack of staffing will only make it harder to tackle the remaining caseload. (A DOJ spokesperson told me in a statement that “after four years of bureaucratic weaponization under the Biden Administration, President Trump and Attorney General Bondi have created the most efficient Department of Justice in American history.”)

The mission and purpose of the department has also been overhauled—many of its core functions have been politicized since Trump’s return to office. The president has directed the department to pursue his personal enemies and has replaced career DOJ employees with inexperienced MAGA loyalists, sometimes to the detriment of his own agenda. Take the recent prosecution of two longtime Trump rivals, New York State Attorney General Letitia James and former FBI Director James Comey. In September, after an acting U.S. attorney reportedly decided that the case against Comey was too weak to pursue, the president pressured him to resign and replaced him with one of his former lawyers, Lindsey Halligan, who had never prosecuted a case before. Halligan appeared to make several fundamental errors in presenting Comey’s case, and her cases against James and Comey have since been thrown out. She resigned in January, a few months after a judge ruled that she had been illegally appointed.

The New York Times reported that Bondi’s former chief of staff put out an open call on social media for lawyers who “support President Trump and anti-crime agenda” to privately message him about jobs within the department. These were, until recently, some of the most prestigious positions in the American legal system—the “crème de la crème,” my colleague Quinta Jurecic, who covers politics and law, told me. Now the halls are empty enough that a department affiliate is seeking out applicants online.

At least the remaining employees know who’s in charge. This afternoon, a banner was hung on the DOJ building’s facade—on it, right above the slogan “Make America Safe Again,” was a picture of the president.

Here are three new stories from The Atlantic:

The quest to live forever has fascinated humans for millennia. The Epic of Gilgamesh, composed about 4,000 years ago, follows a king who searches the world for a plant that can restore youth, only to lose the plant to a thieving snake. The (likely apocryphal) story of Juan Ponce de León, who is said to have embarked on a search for the Fountain of Youth in the early 16th century, refuses to die—unlike its protagonist, who was killed along his journey.

Today’s longevity-medicine movement is driven by the same aggressive desire for eternal youth as the mythic stories of old. But whereas in earlier times ideas about wellness could travel only as fast as the people who held them, today just about anyone with an internet connection can use social media and AI-generated graphics to sell medical advice in seconds. Despite a decided shortage of placebo-controlled trials in humans to support that advice, the business of longevity is booming, thanks in large part to sleek direct-to-consumer marketing delivered by health influencers with far more confidence than evidence. By 2030, $8 trillion might be spent annually on longevity-related products.

Read. A new book buries the Obama-era idea that small shifts in personal behavior can greatly improve the world, Rob Wolfe writes.

Watch. A breakthrough film is rarely nominated only for its screenplay. In 2022, David Sims picked some of the best films from previous years that were underappreciated by the Academy in this way.

            <h2>Let’s Talk About RFK Jr.’s Workout Pants</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-02-20</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/2026/02/rfk-jrs-workout-pants/686071/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">A post on X claimed to be a simple message from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services: Stay active; eat well. But the 90-second video it shared, called “Secretary Kennedy and Kid Rock’s Rock Out Work Out,” seems designed to be bewildering. Here was Robert F. Kennedy Jr. eating steak and doing preacher curls in his belted blue jeans and a pair of hiking shoes; and here he was again, stripping off his T-shirt to ride an exercise bike inside a sauna; and here he was a little later, strutting over to a cold-plunge tub (still in his blue jeans but with the belt removed); and here he went into the tub, sliding underwater in his dungarees.

Why was the HHS secretary bathing in a pair of pants? The video never provides an answer for this question, even as Kennedy plays pickleball, then mugs for the camera, then soaks in a Jacuzzi with a glass of milk, all while still in jeans. It’s just bizarre—a PSA that presumably has been dialed in by his staff to maximize its WTF effect. (The video has been viewed more than 13 million times and produced some 11,000 replies; HHS did not respond to a request for comment about the video or the jeans.) However his peculiar gymwear habit started, its present state is very clear: The secretary’s jeans are self-aware.

Kennedy’s proclivity for working out in belted denim long predates the knowing wink with which it’s now displayed. Take the summer’s “DOD-HHS Fitness Challenge,” for which Kennedy donned his favorite workout gear and did a bunch of pull-ups with Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth. Or the viral clip of him from 2023, wearing jeans and boots and nothing else, squeezing out a final set on Venice Beach. I don’t believe that these show a man who lifts in jeans to maximize his clicks. I believe that they show instead a man who fits a waning archetype in fitness culture, a species that has for decades been endemic to the gym: Kennedy is a jeans guy.

I’ve worked out, off and on, for more than 30 years—and for all of that time, the jeans guys have remained a steady presence on the rubber floors. They are sometimes taciturn, sometimes chatty. They often pair their jeans with boots, as Kennedy will do, and with a T-shirt or a tank top or a hoodie. But lest you think he simply has no truck with any gym-specific gear, the jeans guy is sometimes spotted wearing padded lifting gloves, or a leather lifting belt across his Levi’s. At times, his social role will overlap with that of other weight-room regulars, not least of which is the gym grandpa, who hangs around and shoots the breeze and doles out tips on how to lift. However he appears, and however much he gabs, the jeans guy’s social status is the same: He’s an outsider. Rarely does one find a jeans guy paired up with a workout partner. “It’s usually like, ‘The jeans guy rides alone,’” Tolga Ozyurtcu, a historian of physical culture at the University of Texas at Austin, told me when I called him up to talk about this phenomenon.

Not everyone enjoys the company of the jeans guy. Some see him as a threat. Planet Fitness once made a point of banning denim in the gym, along with grunting, dropping dumbbells, and judging others. (Those who broke these rules could be punished with a “lunk alarm” and summarily kicked out.) But this discrimination feels as ill-considered as it is unfair: In my experience, jeans guys are harmless at the very worst, and at best, they add some needed color to a dreary landscape. In this way, the jeans guys are akin to other gentle curiosities, such as the shorts guys who alight on college campuses in wintertime, and the black chipmunks that scamper by from time to time in city parks.

What motivates the jeans guy? No one knows. He is, if nothing else, as inscrutable as a four-leaf clover. Ask him why he isn’t wearing shorts, and he will likely tell you that he chooses denim for efficiency. When Fox News’s Jesse Watters asked Kennedy in August to explain his favored workout gear, all Watters got was this: “Well, I just started doing that a long time ago because I would go hiking in the morning and then I’d go straight to the gym, and I found it was convenient, and now I’m used to it.” In the hope of getting more, I reached out to Ryan Calder, the fitness coach who spotted Kennedy on the incline bench in that viral video from 2023. Did Calder—who at the time was dressed, quite reasonably, in shorts—happen to ask Kennedy about his denim pants and boots? He did. “I asked him right then, you know, like, ‘So, you’re banging it out in jeans?,’” he told me. “And he’s like, ‘Yeah, man, this is my efficient way. I only have 30 minutes. I don’t spend time changing clothes.”

A jeans guy’s self-report must be taken with a grain of salt—maybe even he cannot really fathom why he lives the way he does. Kennedy’s is no exception to this rule. In public appearances, he is almost always in a suit and skinny tie, so adding a daily interlude in workout denim would hardly seem to be a way of saving time. His habit may be instead a product of the workout culture he imbibed during his youth. “The jeans guy, it’s a thing. It’s a very definitive thing,” Conor Heffernan, a fitness historian at Ulster University, told me. “It’s a trope we’ve had since the ’80s.” The power lifters of the time, some of whom were connected to the biker subculture, adopted a “rugged, spit-and-sawdust aesthetic” in the gym, he said. This included denim. During the same period, glitzy photoshoots for bodybuilders also featured jeans, to match the styles of the time. Heffernan brought up a famous photo of Lee Haney, the eight-time Mr. Olympia, flexing shirtless in a pair of jeans above a steamy manhole cover in New York City. Perhaps the older jeans guys of today—Kennedy himself is 72—are nothing less than living fossils.

Their aesthetic may have faded out, but a younger set of jeans guys—ironic jeans guys—has since emerged in the fitness culture. Take the influencer-marathoner Truett Hanes: His brand is built on running very fast and very far … in jeans. He claims that this started as a goof, but it has turned into a business. He now represents a denim company, as well as a chafing cream. The idea of working out in jeans, partly silly and partly serious, is everywhere once you start to look for it. One gymwear brand, Raskol, launched a line of lifter jeggings in 2023 in shades such as “blue steele” and “pale thunder,” with a tongue-in-cheek campaign that had bodybuilders boasting of their pride at using PEDs—that is, “performance-enhancing denims.”

This self-mocking move may be just the prelude to a fuller jeans-guy renaissance, Heffernan suggested. After all, Raskol’s jeggings did sell out, he said. And this wouldn’t be the first time that a traditional signifier of masculinity crept back into mainstream culture by way of performative half jokes. The fashion for bushy beards, and beards’ association with authentic manliness, has followed this same trajectory from irony to earnestness during its various resurgences since the early 19th century. Now the same could be happening to denim workout pants: Today’s goof evolves into tomorrow’s masculine ideal. “I think irony moves into fashion very quickly in fitness,” Heffernan said.

For Kennedy, this process may appear to be going in reverse: His latest workout video shows that he’s in on the joke, that in 2026 he’s capable of pumping irony as well as iron, and that he can engage in what Heffernan described as “a very deliberate deployment of jeans.” But it also shows that there is a recipe, if not a cultural machinery, for rehabilitating out-of-date ideas. Not all of Kennedy’s eccentricities are as quaint as how he dresses in the gym, and there are many ways of going backwards in pursuit of health while pretending that you’ve found a way into the future. MAHA is nostalgia, sometimes with a smirk. The jeans guy dunks himself in water. The jeans guy is reborn.</div>

ChatGPT and food-delivery droids came to my campus at roughly the same time, in the 2022–23 academic year. My response—cranky, tweedy—was hopelessly on brand for a history professor. The chatbot and the droid appeared to be in league, robotic species on the vanguard of civilizational collapse. Both were premised on the idea of frictionless ease, liberating their users from outmoded toils. Because you couldn’t kick the chatbot, I had to resist the urge to kick the droids. I felt new and sudden sympathy with those English weavers who tried to smash the machines.

I’d like to think that my grievance was rooted in something beyond my own impending irrelevance. The product of too many years of humanities education, I wanted to defend the foundational exercise of writing. Going back to the late 19th century, writing instruction in the humanities has been premised on the idea of writing as both a craft and an art: a practical skill that could be taught and refined, and a creative practice through which sustained effort yielded insight. The formula went something like this: We read things, we had conversations about them to unravel their many levels, then we went and wrote. In that final part of the cycle—the writing part—were torments, perhaps even tortures, but good things happened. We became thinking people, mingling with complex ideas and perhaps coming up with some of our own. The advent of the chatbot raised an unsettling question: What if writing didn’t have to be hard? What if that noble ordeal was no more necessary than going to a well to fetch your water when you could just turn on a tap?

Combing through the archives of The Atlantic, one might reasonably conclude that both writing instruction and civilization have been in peril since roughly 1890. In 1893, James Jay Greenough argued that young minds had become impoverished by too many slang words to form anything but “narrow” ideas. By November of 1959, when the magazine had a special section on “The Teaching of Reading and Writing,” excessive emphasis on standardized testing had pushed writing instruction to the side—just at the moment when young people’s minds were becoming addled by modern media and the popularity of “illiterate expressions.”

Easy as it is to mock the melodrama of such pronouncements, I can understand them. Underlying the different diagnoses and prescriptions is the basic idea that animated my own efforts as a professor: that learning to write was vital to the formation of a mind. As Henry Chauncey put it in the magazine in 1959, the “art of written communication” was “clear thinking clearly expressed.” Something essential was happening in the hard work of trying to make your thoughts comprehensible to another human being (even if that human being was just your teacher). The sparks thrown off in the process could become the energy for better thoughts—for more complex and perhaps even original ideas.

The trouble was that thinking the thoughts, finding the words, and getting them down on the page could involve considerable discomfort. Writing in the magazine in 1912, soon after graduating from college, Randolph Bourne described the “hopeless labor of writing.” “One must struggle constantly,” Bourne lamented, “to warm again the thoughts that are cold or have been utterly consumed.”

Students didn’t turn to chatbots to warm their cold and consumed thoughts all at once, but the advent of AI tools sparked a disorienting reckoning for those of us reading their papers. At first, some of the work coming in was just a little weird. Certain papers appeared as Frankenstein monsters of machine-made and human text, some of it eloquent yet empty, some of it strained  and meandering in familiar ways.

But in the years to come, with updated models and the fuller integration of AI into people’s lives, I noticed a general smoothing out of student writing. The hard edges and rough parts were getting sanded down, and the arguments and ideas were more uniform. It was less common to see the kinds of errors I’d hoped to preempt on the guide to writing and history I gave the students. They didn’t refer to works of historical scholarship as “novels” much anymore, but they also didn’t find their way into some beautiful, odd idea in a convoluted sentence buried in the second paragraph on page 4.

By the end of last year, I had dusted off blue books for the first time in years and had the students sit for an in-class essay. Reading their tortured handwriting was a small price to pay to see their thoughts anew—messy, but alive.</div>

If you put any stock in the ability of IQ tests to assess intelligence, we humans have spent the past century steadily getting smarter. (And if you don’t put any stock in them, well, we humans have steadily gotten better at IQ tests.)

Because IQ is a standardized measure, humankind’s average score still sits at 100—but this isn’t your granddaddy’s 100. IQ tests are regularly recalibrated, and over the past many decades, when new subjects have taken an old test, they have almost always outscored their predecessors’ average; Grandpa’s generation might have hovered around 100, but the kids are scoring 115 … which then becomes the new 100.

This phenomenon is called the Flynn effect, and researchers still aren’t sure what causes it. Perhaps it’s due to more efficient education or better nutrition. The reason could be that modern environments contain more interesting stimuli or that modern gasoline no longer contains lead.

I haven’t seen anyone propose that trivia is to thank, but the growing popularity of quizzing tracks with the IQ trend line pretty well too. I think I speak for all of science when I say we shouldn’t rule it out quite yet.

And by the way, did you know that barcode scanning was initially greeted with a huge backlash? The first item ever scanned by barcode was a pack of Wrigley’s chewing gum at a supermarket in Troy, Ohio, in June 1974, but by the end of the ’70s, only about 1 percent of stores had adopted barcodes.

Consumers were worried that the tech would be used to rip them off. Advocacy groups mounted campaigns against the barcode, and protesters even picketed stores that used scanners. Others swore that the barcode was the biblical “mark of the beast.”

Obviously, it eventually caught on, and people got over their fears—though if you ever get rung up at $6.66, maybe offer to round to the next dollar, just in case.

And by the way, did you know that the University of Bologna is nearly a millennium old? It’s the world’s oldest university that was founded as such (at least one older university started as a madrasa), and its alumni include Copernicus, Dante, and more than one pope.

Imagine trying to write a halfway-decent poem for an assignment, and your classmate turns in the Divine Comedy. Then again, at least you’d have had a leg up on Copernicus, who probably got marked off plenty for insisting that the Earth actually orbits the sun.</div>

Because the gutted program effectively worked for freedom of speech by building technologies that enable censorship evasion in each country. The new program will only provide access to contents through the censorship filter of the US administration.

Not really an &quot;alternative&quot;. The previous program was about helping people break out of oppressive government controlled networks. This is about funneling everyone through the US (oppressive?) network.

This got going on threats and planning on banning X for AI childporn fakes by UK and others. Musk is probably involved.

Then you have all that neo-nazi stuff that gets banned and Musk was upset at Germany curtailing that...

What&#39;s to stop the powers that be over in those European countries from just adding freedom.gov to the blacklist and calling it a day?  This would be as silly as me trying to launch a VPN service that lets you bypass Florida&#39;s porn age verification requirements, from inside Florida.  I realize it&#39;s not a 1:1 analogy, I&#39;m just saying that you can&#39;t successfully fight something you disagree with when you&#39;re clearly at a disadvantaged position to mount your attack.

&quot;It&#39;s over Anakin, I have the high ground!&quot;

Yes, you are missing something rather obvious.

Literally nobody in Europe will even for a moment think that a xxx.GOV domain hosts anything but stupid trumpistani propaganda, and the thing will be just as popular as the &quot;melania&quot; movie, which isn&#39;t tracking even on pornolab.

There&#39;s more than enough crap you can read in our native European in all those national and .eu domains as it is.

Bullshit. They will certainly hand it out for the right price.

Make a site for kids where they can access the content of all the books GOP N@zis are banning from school libraries.

Great job, guys, fight censorship abroad while allowing states to censor the crap out of 3D printing and any vaguely related piece of software that interacts with it.I&#39;m no 3D printer expert (don&#39;t have space for one and really don&#39;t have the patience to design things in CAD, so I never got into it), but it seems to me that the cost of a printer capable of printing the receiver portion of a gun + the costs of remainder of the necessary gun parts, exceeds that of just buying a basic inexpensive pistol.

Imagine going back in time and telling the founders that people would have to get permission from the government to make a gun.

Back in the modern world, there&#39;s nothing illegal in the US in making guns for personal use and many people do. This law is both idiotic and blatantly unconstitutional.

Generally it is not illegal for you to rent time in a machine shop (in the United States) to produce a receiver (depending on various state laws.)

It is also generally not illegal in the United States (again, depending on various state laws) to run your own small scale ammunition press at home to make your own ammo.  It is in fact, the only way for certain out-of production calibers to be produced these days, unless you want to commission a custom run.  There are also people who design and produce their own

Or download your OctaPrint firmware outside of the US. Or delete any silly reporting or AI nonsense that someone tries to add to the firmware you want to use.

What else should one expect from all these red states?

Today I learned that the states proposing these insane 3D printer bans, California, Washington, and New York - some of the most rabidly liberal states in the US - are, in fact, &quot;red states&quot;.

I mean, if you mean USSR red, then... yeah.

From your prescient assessment it would seem that the country formerly known as the USA has boiled down to just two shades of red, USSR-red and ruzzkie-pederation-red.

&quot;DOJ&quot; in this case refers to the California Department of Justice, not the US Federal Department of Justice.

Text of the proposed California Assembly bill is here:

https://leginfo.legislature.ca... [ca.gov]

How is this software going to know you&#39;re not repairing a water gun?

The receiver is whatever the ATF says it is.  In some cases, the frame is the receiver (for example a revolver, or a traditionally manufactured pistol).  In other cases, the metal rails that nest in the interchangeable plastic frame are the receiver.

A trigger is typically not considered part of the receiver.  However, there&#39;s nothing in the proposed law that says that the trigger shall be excluded from consideration as part of an overall algorithm to prevent printing of &quot;a firearm.&quot;

criminalize useing NON HP INK pass that bill now!!

Mass displacement of white collar workers underway.  A lot of careers outside of the white collar world require training and certification, with barriers to licensing (outside of exams) such as minimum number of hours worked before qualifying to sit for an exam.  Unemployment hasn&#39;t been adjusted to keep up with inflation.  Things are not great.

3D printers could be used to make unapproved machines at home.  Better tax people to create a bureaucracy dedicated to keeping people from potentially causing a non-existent public threat.  Best case - security theater.  Worst case - camel under the nose to start regulating computing devices as well.  After all, computers could be used to *gasp* share machine drawings for people to manufacture gun parts without a 3D printer!

Also, g-code is used not just for additive manufacturing, but also for things like routers and mills.  If you regulate all software capable of generating g-code for a 3D printer, you&#39;re also directly regulating all computing platforms used in those industries.  Open source project to generate g-code for a cricut?  Could be used as a circumvention device, BANNED.  Open source project to build a CNC mill requires a slicer - which now is illegal to run without a government subscription and yearly licensing fee in California.  Effectively BANNED.

Great, there goes the in-state manufacturing industry.  I guess we&#39;ll just have to ship all our work out of state, and those jobs too...

This really feels like rearranging deck chairs on the Titanic for the sake of &quot;doing something&quot;.  Invent a problem that doesn&#39;t exist, and then spend money making it go away.  Can we please start laying off politicians instead?  Or identifying the lobbyists that are pushing for this so we can rightly tar and feather them before this spreads any further?

BTW, folks from other states might not understand, this kind of insanity is standard in California (introduce invasive laws that make no sense) due to the fact that our legislature is FULL TIME.

Yes, we pay them (and their staffs) for 365 days of work (minus vacation and holidays).  And this is what they give us.

https://ballotpedia.org/States... [ballotpedia.org]

&quot;As of 2017, full-time legislatures generally had larger staffs than other legislatures. A few exceptions to this rule were Florida and Texas, whose hybrid legislatur

They do this instead of dealing with the homeless crisis, drug crisis, housing crisis, etc.

We can&#39;t get these jokers to do rent control or block foreign real estate speculation. So they keep trying to put GPS in our electric cars to tax us, or put vague requirements to control theoretically dangerous technology that is simply not a primary problem in this state right now.

1. &quot;The Public&quot; are idiots.2. How does &quot;being traceable&quot; somehow reduce crime? I seem to remember a study some years ago which found very few crime guns were traced because it either couldn&#39;t be done or there was no benefit to doing it.

&quot;Tracing&quot; is just another argument for registration, which is another word for confiscation.

Road to hell.  Check.Good intentions.  Check.

At this point I&#39;d want to know what the estimate is for establishing and funding the CA DOJ apparatus to regulate 3D printers in the state, and the impact it would case on professional and hobbyist markets through:

1.  Regulatory compliance.  There are a number of pistols that are not sold in California because California has its own set of safety certifications that manufacturers have to get that effectively act as a ban on sales in the state (hint, it&#39;s an effec

Sacramento wants to disarm every Californian. Would be a shame if a tyrant were to show up one of these days and steal elections, end our democratic processes, and overthrow 250 years of Constitutional government.

No no you&#39;re clearly mistaken. According to science, only right-coded policies can possibly have downsides and any left-coded policy is self-evidently an unalloyed good.

Just make 3D printed guns illegal. Put people in prison if they are found with one when they commit a crime. Oh wait. IT&#39;S ALREADY ILLEGAL. We already seize these guns by the thousands.

People have made hundreds of thousands of ghost guns in California before 3D printing was even viable. Both through the legal loop hole for 80% receivers and after that loophole was mostly plugged in California. It&#39;s too easy to do with shit you can get at harbor freight and a little practice and patience. And once one guy in

The Lives of Others (2006) [imdb.com], about life in the Communist GDR (East Germany). There is a plot where one of the main characters is writes a news story the authorities don&#39;t approve of. They have many prominent authors identified by their preferred make/model of manual typewriter, so the fellow is smuggled a compact model from outside the republic so he can write without the government tracing the writing to him.

Unless the California state government plans to interfere with interstate commerce (which I believe is a violation of the constitution), this new measure wont matter at all, and I doubt they want to be affiliated with Cold War regimes.

I have just 3 points.I know I am getting old, but it seems like just last week there were no commercial 3D printers, they were all home built.  Then the hobby reached critical mass, and now there is a big market with lots of commercial models, and people making a living running giant print farms.  But it was still very recently that most printers were not commercial.  All that knowledge has not had time to go away, the firmware running these printers is still actively developed and freely available. So my f

No wait, fuck Notch too, he said he would open source MC when he was done working on it.

His choice. His right to change his mind for like a billion $$$. What nerve; you are entitled to his work? Did he PROMISE or just openly express a passing feeling? Sign a contract? Make a conditional deal with supporters? Falsely advertise?  Maybe, I don&#39;t know.

It&#39;s just a stupid game. It&#39;s not like you built infrastructure around him and made that decision on his word that he&#39;d open source it later.

Nah, I&#39;m 100% unsurprised and I probably would have done the same thing faced with the big stupid money. But then people would be justified in saying fuck me.

Microsoft is adapting to Apple dropping OpenGL support.

Can anyone confirm if this will break all old mods?Everyone can confirm this, but I think it&#39;s time we let you learn it yourself. Click the second link in TFS and do your own homework. It&#39;s right there spelled out for you.

Obviously it won&#39;t break all mods.  Most mods don&#39;t directly use the rendering system at all, and only a very few will do things directly in OpenGL.  It will likely affect mods that change the rendering or visuals in some way, like Iris Shaders or Optifine.

Mojang seem like they are aware of the value of the modding community more than many game makers.  The very fact that they are signalling this change in advance is an indicator of this!

Minecraft is an unoptimized, piece of steamy shit. The modding community of Minecraft is toxic and lazy.

LOL, I hear ya. My son was working on some MC mods a few years ago for friends of his. He pretty much summed up his experience with MC and the community the same way.

The term Orwellian is often trotted out as a cliché, but it suits the confluence of President Donald Trump’s two big actions today—holding the first meeting of his “Board of Peace” and finishing the mobilization of a massive military force on the flanks of Iran, ready to attack the Islamic Republic as soon as this weekend.

His Board of Peace, to which Trump said the U.S. would commit $10 billion (for what, it’s unclear), seems largely theatrical. The war in Gaza, which Trump claims to have ended, persists—Israel continues its demolitions, while Hamas is tightening its grip on the place and refusing to disarm—and the board’s larger goal of supplanting or overseeing the United Nations worldwide is fanciful, to say the least.

Meanwhile, the point of the armed buildup around Iran—the largest assembly of U.S. warplanes and warships in the region since the 2003 invasion of Iraq—is remarkably unclear. The U.S. armada mobilized to the region includes 18 warships (two of which are aircraft carriers) and many fighter jets, bombers, antimissile systems, and electronic jammers on nearby bases. This is enough to fight a weekslong battle, hitting targets related to any and all of those missions and disabling or intercepting most of the missiles that Iran might launch in response. But for what purpose—and with what chance of success, whatever the purpose might be—is another question.

Does Trump want to destroy Iran’s nuclear program, dismantle its ballistic missile sites, pull down the regime, or simply threaten a combination of all three to pressure the Iranians to make a “deal”—but a deal to do what?

In January, Trump threatened “strong” military action against Iran if its leaders killed any of the growing mass of anti-government protesters. Tehran canceled the execution of one protester, leading Trump to pronounce his demand satisfied. However, troops and police proceeded to mow down thousands, possibly tens of thousands, of protesters in the streets, to no objection from Washington. As was the case in Venezuela, democracy and human rights were pieces of Trump’s original war rhetoric—but not in his war policy.

Many were shocked when his real policy in Venezuela turned out to be abducting its criminal president, Nicolás Maduro, and compelling his successors—who had been deputies in Maduro’s Cabinet—to cede control of their country’s oil to the United States. Maria Corina Machado, the leader of Venezuela’s democratic opposition, who expected to take power if Maduro were overthrown, was pushed under the bus. (Her attempt to gain Trump’s favor—giving him the Nobel Peace Prize trophy that she won but that he thought he’d deserved—was a futile gesture.)

So what, exactly, is Trump up to in Iran?

Is he now going after its oil? Probably not, though keeping the oil from being traded to Iran’s biggest customer, China, might be part of the equation. Still, the assembled armada seems overkill for that goal.

Trump says his main concern is to keep Iran from building a nuclear weapon. The irony is that Trump claimed to “obliterate” the nation’s nuclear program in last June’s attack—known as Operation Midnight Hammer—on Iran’s mountain-buried enriched-uranium site. As many noted at the time, Trump exaggerated the extent of the damage; for one thing, Iranians might have removed much of the uranium in anticipation of the assault. However, the damage did significantly set back Iran’s program, perhaps by a few years. What is the rush now?

Iran’s ballistic missiles endanger Israel and U.S. bases in the region. In the brief Iran-Israel war last summer, 90 percent of Iran’s missiles were shot down or crashed before reaching their targets. But Iran launched 550 missiles, as well as 1,000 drones, and the 50 or so that pierced through the defenses inflicted considerable damage. It is not known how many missiles Iran has now—probably a few thousand. Manufacturing sites are concentrated and can be taken out fairly easily, but the missiles themselves are small and mobile. Many would survive an initial onslaught, and if Tehran’s leaders think their regime is about to be crushed, they might decide to launch a massive retaliation, bringing down their enemies along with themselves. In fact, in recent weeks, some Middle East leaders, notably the Saudis and other Sunnis (who have been fighting proxy wars against Iran on various fronts) urged Trump not to attack Iran, fearing that Iran would return fire against their lands too. They have barred U.S. planes from flying over their territory if Trump does decide to attack.

Here, then, is another irony. As a result of last summer’s missile exchanges, June’s Midnight Hammer, and a string of devastating attacks on Iran’s main proxy militias, Hamas and Hezbollah, Israel is now stronger and Iran is weaker than they have been in decades. Trump’s mobilization in the region underlines this disparity. Does Iran really pose a threat that justifies such a massive U.S. reaction?

Then again, from Israel’s perspective, Iran’s relative weakness is the point. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has long pushed for regime change in Tehran. Though he never said so explicitly, his opposition to the Iran nuclear deal, which President Barack Obama and six other leaders signed in 2014, wasn’t so much fear of an Iranian bomb (the accord really did all but stop its development) as fear that the removal of Iran’s sanctions and its integration into the world economy—the rewards for dismantling its nuclear apparatus—would solidify the Islamic Republic’s position, strengthen its international standing, and thereby increase Israel’s vulnerability, if not to nuclear bombs, then to other forms of intimidation. During Trump’s first term, Netanyahu persuaded him to rip up the nuclear deal; with the president now in his second term, the prime minister is hoping to lasso him into finishing off the regime.

The Iranian government is a horror. It represses its own people, now more than ever; it assists terrorists; and it’s an economic disaster as well. But it’s worth asking: If the mullahs are toppled or lose their grip on power in one way or another, who replaces them? It’s extremely unlikely that the successors would be the Western-leaning urban youth who have been demonstrating in the streets. They lack leaders and organizers, mainly because the regime has imprisoned or killed rising potential leaders—and disabled or co-opted tools and technologies that could enable organization.

If the mullahs fell, power would likely be picked up by the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps. This is the Iranian army’s elite unit, with more than 150,000 personnel, who protect the regime, control much of the economy, and are no less hostile than the supreme leader and his mullahs toward Israel, Sunnis, and the West.

It’s possible that U.S. and Israeli intelligence agencies have made contact with certain IRGC officers, discussing terms of mutual support in the event of regime change. We now know that the CIA infiltrated the Venezuelan leadership, which helped the U.S. Special Forces track down Maduro. However, we don’t yet know whether or how long Venezuela’s old-new leaders will keep to their side of whatever long-term bargain they might have struck. It’s doubly uncertain whether any emerging IRGC strongmen—with whom the U.S. has had no aboveground relationship at all—would honor any deal. It’s a very poor bet to act on the assumption that they would.

Which leads to the final possibility: that Trump is amassing all this firepower to pressure the Iranians to make a deal. He has said that, to avoid dreadful consequences, Iran must agree to enrich no uranium, dismantle its ballistic missiles, and sever relations with Shiite militias in the region.

The problem is that these terms are untenable to Iran, and would be even if the country had more-pliant leaders.

In the early stages of negotiation toward the 2014 nuclear deal, Obama also pushed for a ban on enrichment but soon realized that this was a dead end. The Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (which is observed by 191 nation-states, including Iran) not only allows its signatories to enrich uranium to 3 percent purity, but it enshrines that level of enrichment as a right. This level is very low. “Highly enriched” uranium is defined as 20 percent, “weapons-grade” as 90 percent. The treaty further allows international inspectors to verify whether countries are abiding with this limit. Obama’s Iran nuclear deal had tight inspection procedures; Iran was declared in compliance.

For Iran to accept a ban on enrichment, when the rest of the world is entitled to some, would be tantamount to surrender before a shot has been fired. No leader, Islamist or otherwise, would accept this.

A ban on ballistic missiles is also unlikely, as they are Iran’s main source of deterrence. Iran’s support for radical militias—such as Hamas, Hezbollah, and the Houthis—does clarify the regime’s nature: A government can legitimately observe a right to bear conventional arms and enrich uranium (a little bit, anyway) but not to arm havoc-wreaking militias. Still, the Iranians have relied so heavily on these militias for power in the region that they would need tangible benefits to cut the cord.

What is the Trump administration offering Iran in return for taking such extraordinary measures? The question is misleading. There is no “Trump administration” when it comes to such matters. There is only Trump and his two emissaries, fellow real-estate tycoon Steve Witkoff and Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner. They have supplanted, and for the most part ignored, the experienced experts in the State Department and the National Security Council who usually hammer out positions and handle negotiations.

Witkoff has no diplomatic experience whatever. Kushner did play a role in the Abraham Accords, which formalized diplomatic and economic relations between Israel and some Arab states (the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, and Morocco), but those nations already had informal relations, and they were not at all in a state of war.

Like Trump, they seem to believe that diplomacy requires no special knowledge and that dealmaking is dealmaking, whether you’re dealing with the Kremlin, the Islamic Republic of Iran, or the New York City Buildings Department. This blithe arrogance is naivete disguised as hardheadedness, and it goes a long way toward explaining the pair’s utter failure at settling the war in Ukraine. (There, they don’t grasp Russian President Vladimir Putin’s motive for war. If they did, they would realize that he doesn’t want peace without the complete subjugation of Kyiv.)

What happens these next few days in and around Iran? Who knows. It’s possible Trump himself doesn’t know. The Iranians will try to stretch out the negotiations, which they probably see as inherently fruitless. Trump may wait them out for a while, but perhaps not for long. If he starts a war, he may try to keep it limited at first, but the Iranians may escalate, anticipating their worst-case scenario, which Trump may then make a self-fulfilling prophecy.

Wars, once started, sometimes spiral out of control. This is why it’s smart for leaders to know what they want, and know how far they want to press things, before they make their first move. It’s also why, in negotiating a peaceful way out of a crisis, it’s good for them to know what the other side wants too—not necessarily to appease them but to scope out the boundaries of what’s possible without war and, given that, whether it’s better to modify peace terms or go to war.

At this point, it looks like Trump, pushed by Netanyahu, is rushing into conflict recklessly.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Sign up for Executive Dysfunction, a weekly newsletter that surfaces under-the-radar stories about what Trump is doing to the law—and how the law is pushing back.

On Jan. 26, U.S. District Judge Michael Farbiarz prohibited ICE from moving an immigrant, Baljinder Kumar, out of New Jersey while he challenged his unlawful detention. Five days later, Immigration and Customs Enforcement flagrantly defied that order, transferring Kumar to a detention center in … Texas. After his lawyers complained, federal officials returned Kumar to New Jersey. But Farbiarz was not inclined to let this disobedience go unpunished. He informed the New Jersey U.S. attorney’s office that he sought to craft a “remedy” for ICE’s defiance—and would require an “investigation” to assist him. He then ordered the office to investigate itself and to “enumerate each instance” in which it had “violated an order issued by a judge of this district” since Dec. 5.

Last Friday, Jordan Fox—an associate deputy attorney general and special attorney assigned to New Jersey—gave Farbiarz an answer: The office had violated at least 56 court orders since December alone, all related to the Trump administration’s unlawful policy mandating the indefinite detention of noncitizens legally entitled to a bond hearing. This confession, first reported by Politico’s Kyle Cheney, was accompanied by a letter stating that “we regret deeply all violations” but insisting that they were “unintentional and immediately rectified once we learned of them.” Fox, who is helping lead the New Jersey office after courts ousted Donald Trump’s first choice, Alina Habba, depicted these transgressions as relatively minor and rare. But Farbiarz did not buy it, noting that Kumar’s illegal transfer to Texas was far from an “outlier.”

On this week’s Slate Plus bonus episode of Amicus, co-hosts Dahlia Lithwick and Mark Joseph Stern discussed this court-ordered investigation, its startling conclusions, and the possible consequences. A preview of their conversation, below, has been edited and condensed for clarity.

Dahlia Lithwick: I guess I have to give credit where it’s due. Jordan Fox took one for the team and laid out, chapter and verse, all the court orders this office had violated.

Mark Joseph Stern: Sort of. Fox actually excluded two categories of violations, missed status update deadlines and late docket notifications. When you include those, it’s 75 violations. So let’s dig into these numbers. At least 17 times, the government transferred a noncitizen to a different detention facility after a court unambiguously prohibited it from doing so. That means they were detained in another state, where it would be harder to reach their lawyers, and perhaps where judges are more inclined to rule for the government. At least 10 times, the U.S. attorney’s office failed to produce evidence ordered by the court. And at least one time, the government deported a noncitizen in direct contravention of a court order forbidding that deportation.

In some ways, this is a bigger deal than the ICE lawyer’s meltdown in court a few weeks ago. We now have the U.S. attorney’s office not going rogue here, but admitting under oath that it has breached court orders more than 50 times. And there were often dire consequences for the people whose rights were violated. Fox tried to paint this as a few errors around the edges, but to me it depicts a complete breakdown of the system. And it shows that if you sign up for this work—if you agree to work in a U.S. attorney’s office—you now know you will be violating court orders, maybe on the daily. Everybody is on notice: If you are assigned to handle these cases, you will violate court orders, and you may be held in contempt.

I’m old enough to remember Judge James Boasberg trying to ascertain whether his court order around the rendition flights to CECOT prison was flouted, and the lies and deceit that went into gaslighting him about that. And he’s still trying to get to the bottom of it! We talked about that story obsessively last spring. A year later, defiance of court orders doesn’t capture two weeks of a news cycle. We just say: Yeah, they do that now. They don’t care what judges think anymore. The American public has somehow normalized this.

All I can say is bless Boasberg for continuing to push that contempt case. I am glad to hear the rising chorus of other judges doing the same. We’ve seen Republicans in Congress say they want to impeach judges who hold Trump administration officials in contempt. Maybe this could be a Spartacus moment where you can’t impeach them all?

That takes us back to Minnesota, where Judge Laura Provinzino found Special Assistant U.S. Attorney Matthew Isihara in civil contempt during a Wednesday hearing for violating a court order. She said she’d fine him $500 a day until the government complied. One interesting piece of this story is that Isihara is a JAG attorney who was conscripted to help with the flood of habeas petitions in response to the mass detention policy as prosecutors continue to flee the Justice Department. And even he said he couldn’t handle the caseload.

This story illustrates the mix of incompetence and malice that is defining the administration’s mass detention campaign. The government arrested this individual, Rigoberto Soto Jimenez, at his workplace in January—even though he had lived here since 2018 and has no criminal record or a final order of removal authorizing his deportation. ICE then hustled him to Texas. His lawyers still managed to persuade Provinzino to issue a writ of habeas corpus ordering his immediate release in Minnesota and the return of all confiscated property.

The government did neither. It released him in Texas, not Minnesota, and withheld all of his property, including his driver’s license and other identification paperwork. So he was just dumped and abandoned. His lawyers had to go to Provinzino and tell her that her order had been flagrantly violated, which is when she scheduled the hearing. Soto Jimenez managed to make his way back from Texas, but as of Wednesday, ICE still hadn’t returned his identification cards. So Provinzino held Isihara, the JAG lawyer detailed to this case, in civil contempt until the cards were returned, with the $500 daily sanction. Fox 9 News reports that her order finally prompted the agency to mail back the ID cards. Which gives us the answer to the question we’ve been asking: What will it take to make ICE comply with the law? The answer is dragging JAGs into your courtroom and holding them in contempt.

The caseload is impossible. Nobody can do this volume of work. If you are a government lawyer thinking, Step aside, Mr. Isihara, because I can do this better next time, just know you’re being set up to pay $500 a day for the privilege.

            <h2>Trump Wants Veterans to Lose Benefits As Soon As Their PTSD Symptoms Are Treated. There’s One Problem With That.</h2>
            <p><strong>News and Politics - Slate Magazine | 2026-02-19</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2026/02/trump-veterans-affairs-ptsd-benefits-medicine-fail.html?via=rss">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Sign up for Executive Dysfunction, a weekly newsletter that surfaces under-the-radar stories about what Trump is doing to the law—and how the law is pushing back.

During the troop surge in Iraq, I learned to constantly scan for threats, how to distinguish the sharp crack of a gunshot pointed in my direction from one outgoing toward an enemy, and the myriad ways that explosives can be hidden on a roadside. I learned that hypervigilance can be the difference between life and death. What I didn’t learn was how to turn it off.

Now, I take three psychiatric medications every day, and I go to therapy every week. It’s taken a lot of work over the course of 15 years, but now I’m mostly functional. I raise my kids, go to work, and am part of my community. And I am among the nearly 5 million U.S. veterans who receive service-connected disability compensation, of whom roughly a quarter have a mental health condition such as post-traumatic stress disorder as their primary disability. That compensation is not charity, but compensation for harm incurred in service and a recognition that the government has a debt when the service it demands breaks bodies and minds.

But now, under a new interim rule issued by the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, the fact that medication helps me may also be used to reduce my disability compensation. The rule directs the VA to evaluate disabilities based on how veterans function with medication and treatment, rather than the underlying severity of their conditions. Essentially, if the pills work, good job staying alive; now move on without compensation for the inherent disability.

This issue was actually very recently litigated. Last year, the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims decided Ingram v. Collins, a case that reaffirmed a rule first articulated in Jones v. Shinseki. The court was clear: When VA criteria for treatment do not explicitly mention medication-based improvements as a reason to discontinue disability benefits, the VA must discount the effects of medication and evaluate the disability as it would exist without treatment. That was not a radical interpretation but a straightforward application of the law. Treatment can mask symptoms, but it does not erase the harm. In response, the VA’s new rule asserts a blanket policy of considering the condition only as it presents under treatment, basically penalizing veterans like me for doing the work of staying alive.

The consequences of this shift are not abstract. Peer-reviewed research and VA data show that disability compensation is directly linked to real-life stability for veterans with mental health conditions. A long-term study following veterans who applied for PTSD disability benefits found that those who received benefits experienced meaningful reductions in PTSD symptoms over a decade, compared with veterans who were denied. Those who received compensation were far less likely to experience poverty, with rates around 15 percent, compared to 45 percent among those denied benefits, and their risk of homelessness was nearly half that of denied veterans. Even years later, these differences in socioeconomic stability persisted, despite ongoing impairment. Compensation does not erase the injury, but it gives veterans the resources to manage it and live with it.

I know the stakes personally. The medication I take does not erase the injury. When I have stopped my medication, the symptoms have surged back. I have found myself back in the dark place where I think that I would have been better off if the IED with my name on it that I had always been scanning for had actually gone off and killed me. I have buried too many friends whose treatment worked until it didn’t. Their medications stabilized them, and their therapy helped them, but the underlying injury remained. Now they are dead by suicide.

This is why Ingram mattered. It recognized that improvement through treatment should not cancel out evidence of injury. Symptoms managed by medication are still symptoms, and the underlying disability remains. The VA’s interim rule rejects this principle, allowing improved function to justify rejection of disability status.

The moral and legal logic of compensation is clear: It is not just about whether a veteran can work. It is about acknowledging permanent loss of quality of life that came as a result of their injuries. For example, in the civilian context, when construction workers fall off scaffolds and can’t walk until receiving surgery and physical therapy, their employers have to provide them workers’ compensation. It doesn’t matter if treatment can return them to full function and they can eventually return to work. The injuries occurred on the job, and the company has to provide compensation. “You break it, you buy it.” But for the Trump administration, despite its lavish spending on tax breaks for billionaires, military contracts, and Immigration and Customs Enforcement surges that are tearing the country apart, properly compensating veterans for sacrificing their well-being at the direction of the government is a waste of money that we don’t deserve.

The Trump administration’s interim rule fundamentally misunderstands both the law and the human cost of combat. Improvement does not equal cure, and functioning does not erase harm. VA disability compensation is not a paycheck. It is a recognition of veterans’ lives that will never be the same and a resource to help them pick up the pieces. The fact that symptoms can be controlled through daily maintenance medications is proof the injury is permanent and severe, not that medication can just make it go away. The law once recognized that distinction, and basic decency still should.

            <p><strong>The Register | 2026-02-20</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2026/02/20/jio_ai_plans_india_summit/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">India’s top telco, Reliance Jio, has announced plans to spend $110 billion on datacenters to run AI workloads and says it will use them to deliver services with the same “extreme affordability” it brought to the mobile communications market.

Jio launched its mobile network in 2016 and within half a year won 100 million subscribers by offering plans that included unlimited data at prices that significantly undercut competitors. It later introduced its own handsets, some that cost around $12, which helped it to become India’s number one telco three years after launch. It later cemented its position with a $27 smartphone created with help from Google, a rapid 5G rollout, and cheap subscriptions that bundle streamed content with carriage.

This is not speculative investment. It is not purchasing valuation

Indian authorities say the carrier now has 514 million subscribers and 51 percent of the Indian mobile comms market. India now enjoys some of the lowest mobile data costs in the world.

Company chairman Mukesh Ambani yesterday announced Jio’s intention to spend $110 billion on AI infrastructure over seven years.

“This is not speculative investment. It is not purchasing valuation,” he said in a speech at India’s AI Impact Summit. “This is patient, disciplined, nation-building capital designed to create durable economic value and strategic resilience for decades to come.”

Ambani added his belief that “the biggest constraint in AI today is not talent or imagination. It is scarcity and high cost of compute.” Jio will therefore build multiple gigawatts of datacenter capacity that Ambani said will operate with “the same reliability, quality, scale and extreme affordability that transformed connectivity.”

“India cannot afford to rent intelligence. Therefore, we will reduce the cost of intelligence as dramatically as we did the cost of data.”

Given Jio’s dominance of Indian mobile telecoms, the company could well do the same for consumer AI services.

That’s not necessarily bad news for western AI companies because Jio also announced a partnership that will see some of its products include OpenAI’s search service.

OpenAI, meanwhile, announced a formal presence in India to serve the 100 million users it already has there. The company also said it will build sovereign AI capabilities for India by becoming a tenant in datacenters operated by Tata Group, a giant industrial conglomerate that has pledged it will build 100MW of AI infrastructure for OpenAI. Tata may scale that to 1GW.

India’s AI summit has certainly attracted plenty of attention, with 17 national leaders attending (plus three deputy leaders). OpenAI boss Sam Altman attended. So did Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai, who delivered an anodyne speech. Bill Gates cancelled his appearance – reportedly to ensure his presence in the Epstein files did not distract from the event.

Indian lawmakers have hailed the event as establishing the nation as an AI leader, a claim that’s a little hard to support, as while the nation remains a major source of technology talent and intends widespread use of AI in government services, it lacks significant AI infrastructure and has not yet produced a major company in the field.

Maybe Jio will fill that role, given its past successes. ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">AI agents are becoming more common and more capable, without consensus or standards on how they should behave, say academic researchers.

So says MIT’s Computer Science & Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL), which analyzed 30 AI agents for its 2025 AI Agent Index, which assesses machine learning models that can take action online through their access to software services.

AI agents may take the form of chat applications with tools (Manus AI, ChatGPT Agent, Claude Code), browser-based agents (Perplexity Comet, ChatGPT Atlas, ByteDance Agent TARS), or enterprise workflow agents (Microsoft Copilot Studio, ServiceNow Agent).

The paper accompanying the AI Agent Index observes that despite growing interest and investment in AI agents, &quot;key aspects of their real-world development and deployment remain opaque, with little information made publicly available to researchers or policymakers.&quot;

The AI community frenzy around open source agent platform OpenClaw, and its accompanying agent interaction network Moltbook – plus ongoing frustration with AI-generated code submissions to open source projects – underscores the consequences of letting agents loose without behavioral rules.

In the paper, the authors note that the tendency of AI agents to ignore the Robot Exclusion Protocol – which uses robots.txt files to signal no consent to scraping websites – suggests that established web protocols may no longer be sufficient to stop agents.

It&#39;s a timely topic. Anthropic, one of the main providers of AI agents, on Wednesday published its own analysis of AI agent autonomy, focused more on how agents are used than the consequences of their use.

&quot;AI agents are here, and already they&#39;re being deployed across contexts that vary widely in consequence, from email triage to cyber espionage,&quot; the company said. &quot;Understanding this spectrum is critical for deploying AI safely, yet we know surprisingly little about how people actually use agents in the real world.&quot;

According to consultancy McKinsey, AI agents have the potential to add $2.9 trillion to the US economy by 2030 – assuming the vast capital expenditures by OpenAI and other tech firms haven&#39;t derailed the hype train. We note that enterprises aren&#39;t yet seeing much of a return on their AI investments. And researchers last year found AI agents could only complete about a third of multi-step office tasks. But AI models have improved since then.

MIT CSAIL&#39;s 2025 AI Agent Index covers 30 AI agents. It is smaller than its 2024 predecessor, which looked at 67 agentic systems. The authors say the 2025 edition goes into greater depth, analyzing agents across six categories: legal, technical capabilities, autonomy & control, ecosystem interaction, evaluation, and safety. The AI Agent Index site makes this information available for every listed agent, each with 45 annotation fields.

According to the researchers, 24 of the 30 agents studied were released or received major feature updates during the 2024-2025 period. But the developers of agents talk more about product features than about safety practices.

&quot;Of the 13 agents exhibiting frontier levels of autonomy, only four disclose any agentic safety evaluations (ChatGPT Agent, OpenAI Codex, Claude Code, Gemini 2.5 Computer Use),&quot; according to the researchers.

Developers of 25 of the 30 agents covered provide no details about safety testing and 23 offer no third-party testing data.

To complicate matters, most agents rely on a handful of foundation models – the majority are harnesses or wrappers for models made by Anthropic, Google, and OpenAI, supported by scaffolding and orchestration layers.

The result is a series of dependencies that are difficult to evaluate because no single entity is responsible, the MIT boffins say.

Delaware-incorporated companies created 13 of the agents evaluated by the authors. Five come from China-incorporated organizations, and four come have non-US, non-China origins: specifically Germany (SAP, n8n), Norway (Opera), and Cayman Islands (Manus).

Among the five Chinese-incorporated agent makers, one has a published safety framework and one has a compliance standard.

For agents originating outside of China, 15 point to safety frameworks like Anthropic&#39;s Responsible Scaling Policy, OpenAI&#39;s Preparedness Framework, or Microsoft&#39;s Responsible AI Standard. The other ten lack safety framework documentation. Enterprise assurance standards are more common, with only five of 30 agents having no compliance standards documented.

Twenty-three of the evaluated agents are closed-source. Developers of seven agents open-sourced their agent framework or harness – Alibaba MobileAgent, Browser Use, ByteDance Agent TARS, Google Gemini CLI, n8n Agents, OpenAI Codex, and WRITER.

All told, the Index found agent makers reveal too little safety information, and that a handful of companies dominate the market. Other major findings include the difficulty of analyzing agents given their layers of dependencies, and that agents aren&#39;t necessarily welcome at every website.

The paper lists the following authors: Leon Staufer (University of Cambridge), Kevin Feng (University of Washington), Kevin Wei (Harvard Law School), Luke Bailey (Stanford University), Yawen Duan (Concordia AI), Mick Yang (University of Pennsylvania), A. Pinar Ozisik (MIT), Stephen Casper (MIT), and Noam Kolt (Hebrew University of Jerusalem). ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Researchers at Proofpoint late last month uncovered what they describe as a &quot;weird twist&quot; on the growing trend of criminals abusing remote monitoring and management software (RMM) as their preferred attack tools.

These folks created an entirely fake RMM vendor that purports to sell enterprise software for $300 a month. In fact, it&#39;s a remote access trojan (RAT) being sold as a service. Call it a RATaaS.

The criminals behind the malware took great care to make their product appear legitimate, giving it the name TrustConnect. They even built a fake business website and obtained a legitimate Extended Validation code-signing certificate to digitally sign malware and allow it to bypass security controls.

At first, the crooks even fooled Proofpoint’s threat hunters themselves. &quot;Initially, TrustConnect appeared to be another legitimate RMM tool being abused,&quot; the company’s research team said in a Thursday post.

Criminals prefer using legitimate, commercial software for nefarious purposes because it makes it easier for them to hide inside enterprise IT environments.

Over the past year or so, RMM tools have moved to the top of attackers&#39; must-have list. There are many of them to choose from, enterprises already use and trust many of these tools, and they provide a direct, remote pipeline to victims&#39; machines for deploying ransomware, info-stealers, and other malware, and maintaining long-term access to infected systems.

Security shop Huntress, in its annual cyber threat report released this week, noted skyrocketing RMM abuse, jumping 277 percent in 2025 compared to the year prior and accounting for 24 percent of all observed incidents.

The domain, trustconnectsoftware[.]com, was created on January 12 and the website there was probably written by an AI, according to Proofpoint.

&quot;The malware creator uses the domain as the &#39;business website&#39; designed to convince the public (including certificate providers) that the software is a legitimate RMM app, providing fake details like customer statistics and software documentation,&quot; the team wrote.

This website is also where criminals purchase (via cryptocurrency) a monthly subscription to use the service, and it acts as a command-and-control (C2) center for the malware.

The domain also likely made it easier for the malware operators to purchase a legitimate EV certificate to sign the malware. While the certificate has since been revoked as of February 6, any files signed before then remain valid. Proofpoint credits researchers at The Cert Graveyard for assisting in the revocation of the certificate.

The malware&#39;s C2, hosted on 178[.]128[.]69[.]245, was also disrupted by Proofpoint and anonymous industry partners as of February 17. However, that doesn&#39;t appear to be costing the operators any business as they quickly spun up new infrastructure and began testing a rebranded version of the RAT.

&quot;Shortly before publication of this report, Proofpoint analysts identified a pivot to parallel infrastructure and testing of a new agent payload, called &#39;DocConnect&#39; or &#39;SHIELD OS v1.0,&#39;&quot; the researchers wrote.

The RAT backdoors users&#39; machines and gives attackers full mouse and keyboard control, allowing them to record and stream the victim&#39;s screen. It also provides other typical remote desktop management capabilities such as file transfer, command execution, and user account control bypass.

Proofpoint has attributed the TrustConnect malware &quot;with moderate confidence&quot; to a Redline infostealer customer due to a Telegram handle: @zacchyy09. This was the contact info listed for support and sales inquiries on the TrustConnect website, and the handle was also mentioned as a VIP customer in Operation Magnus, the joint law enforcement effort to takedown the Redline and META information stealing malware in October 2024.

In the blog, the threat hunters detail several campaigns used to distribute the fake RMM, including a phishing operation that began January 26. The emails, sent in both English and French, purported to be invitations to submit a proposal and bid for an upcoming project – with a malicious link to the &quot;full project package.&quot;

The URL leads to an executable file, MsTeams.exe, that drops another executable called TrustConnectAgent.exe and communicates with the TrustConnect RAT C2 server.

“Message volumes ranged from a few dozen to fewer than a thousand per campaign,” Proofpoint threat researcher Selena Larson, told The Register. “Campaigns also varied in terms of the number of customers receiving the messages which ranged from less than ten to over one hundred.”

Other lures used by criminals distributing TrustConnect mention taxes, shared documents, meeting invitations, events, and government themes, we&#39;re told.

Plus, multiple campaigns delivered different – legitimate – RMMs alongside TrustConnect, including ScreenConnect and LogMeIn Resolve.

&quot;The use of legitimate remote enterprise tooling both alongside and as a follow-on malware suggest this RAT is very much embedded with the overall ecosystem of threat actors abusing these tools, and the MaaS provider is likely selling to the same customers abusing real RMM payloads and infrastructure in campaigns,&quot; Proofpoint noted. ®

            <h2>NASA points fingers at Boeing and chaotic culture for Starliner debacle</h2>
            <p><strong>The Register | 2026-02-19</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2026/02/19/nasa_starliner_blame/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">NASA has released the findings from its investigation of the ill-fated crewed Boeing Starliner mission of 2024, and while it still isn&#39;t sure of the root technical causes, it&#39;s admitted that trusting Boeing to do a thorough job appears to have been a mistake.

NASA administrator Jared Isaacman copped to leadership failures across the org during a press conference on Thursday, explaining that while there were definitely technical issues with Starliner during the manned flight that left astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams stranded on the International Space Station for months, those technical issues only arose because of leadership and oversight failures.

&quot;We returned the crew safely, but the path we took did not reflect NASA at our best,&quot; Isaacman said. The NASA chief added that it was down to flight controllers and crew making the right decisions that resulted in the astronauts arriving safely on the ISS.

&quot;Had different decisions been made ... the outcome of this mission could have been very different,&quot; Isaacman said.

NASA&#39;s 311-page report [PDF] on the issue references known technical issues with Starliner, but puts the mission failure, which NASA has declared a type-A mishap, [PDF] down to organizational issues.

Problems with the craft itself included inadequate testing of Starliner&#39;s propulsion system, low telemetry rates, and a lack of onboard data storage during two prior orbital flight tests resulting in insufficient flight data to properly diagnose anomalies, which in turn led to unexplained anomaly acceptance without root cause resolution.

As for cultural issues at NASA, the space org admitted it had limited insight into subcontractor-level data, leaving it unable to verify the readiness of Starliner&#39;s systems. In addition, schedule pressure &quot;dictated a restrictive risk reduction initiative,&quot; and the Commercial Crew Program&#39;s (CCP) shared accountability model &quot;was poorly understood and inconsistently applied,&quot; leading to a lack or ownership of critical issues.

&quot;You can see in the report that inadequately-applied insight and lack of oversight ... is because we had very high confidence in the manufacturer based on their past performance on other programs,&quot; Isaacman said. Oops.

NASA further said in the report that the CCP&#39;s emphasis on provider (i.e., Boeing) autonomy clashed with &quot;NASA&#39;s traditional culture of technical rigor,&quot; and that CCP and Boeing&#39;s leadership was perceived by NASA as &quot;overly risk-tolerant and dismissive of dissenting views.&quot;

Organizationally, NASA concluded, it was too hands-off on Starliner&#39;s development, Boeing was too reliant on subcontractors and had inadequate systems engineering, and the CCP was more focused on Starliner&#39;s success than ensuring that the craft was safe.

NASA didn&#39;t push back on those cultural clashes enough, as Isaacman explained, leaving two astronauts lucky to be alive.

&quot;NASA permitted overarching programmatic objectives of having two providers capable of transporting astronauts to-and-from orbit, influence engineering and operational decisions, especially during and immediately after the mission,&quot; Isaacman said. &quot;We are correcting those mistakes.&quot;

Neither Isaacman nor associate NASA administrator Amit Kshatriya answered questions about whether there would be actual penalties or leadership shakeups at NASA or Boeing as a result of the clash of cultures and systemic failures at both organizations. The pair did make clear that NASA intends to continue with Starliner, and Boeing&#39;s statement to The Register echoed the same.

&quot;In the 18 months since our test flight, Boeing has made substantial progress on corrective actions for technical challenges we encountered and driven significant cultural changes across the team that directly align with the findings in the report,&quot; Boeing told us. &quot;We&#39;re working closely with NASA to ensure readiness for future Starliner missions and remain committed to NASA&#39;s vision for two commercial crew providers.&quot;

The report, and criticisms of CCP as prioritizing &quot;provider success over technical rigor&quot; raise another question: Is the CCP the safest and most effective approach to the future of the US space program when there&#39;s a perfectly good, NASA-managed rocket in the form of the Space Launch System, which is preparing to eventually take astronauts back to the Moon?

We put those questions to Isaacman, and he was unequivocal: CCP isn&#39;t going anywhere.

&quot;CCP is a very successful program,&quot; Isaacman said. &quot;It helped return American spaceflight capability after more than a decade after the Space Shuttle was retired.&quot;

Isaacman said that NASA has been leveraging private industry expertise since the beginning of the space program. He didn&#39;t directly address the question of whether allowing private industry to do the work itself was the best approach in light of NASA&#39;s own admitted CCP culture failures.

&quot;Relying on industry to get us there is one of our strengths,&quot; Isaacman said, before adding that NASA has work to do, too. &quot;There are certainly things we can do better here to achieve our objectives, and step one is the conversation we&#39;re having today.&quot; ®

            <h2>Google germinates Gemini 3.1 Pro in ongoing AI model race</h2>
            <p><strong>The Register | 2026-02-19</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2026/02/19/google_germinates_gemini_31_pro/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">If you want an even better AI model, there could be reason to celebrate. Google, on Thursday, announced the release of Gemini 3.1 Pro, characterizing the model&#39;s arrival as &quot;a step forward in core reasoning.&quot;

Measured by the release cadence of machine learning models, Gemini 3.1 Pro is hard on the heels of recent model debuts from Anthropic and OpenAI. There&#39;s barely enough time to start using new US commercial AI models before a competitive alternative surfaces. And that&#39;s to say nothing about the AI models coming from outside the US, like Qwen3.5.

Google&#39;s Gemini team in a blog post contends that Gemini 3.1 Pro can tackle complex problem-solving better than preceding models. And they cite benchmark test results – which should be viewed with some skepticism – to support that claim. On the ARC-AGI-2 problem-solving test, Gemini 3.1 Pro scored 77.1 percent, compared to Gemini 3 Pro, which scored 31.1 percent, and Gemini 3 Deep Think, which scored 45.1 percent.

Gemini 3.1 Pro outscores rival commercial models like Anthropic&#39;s Opus 4.6 and Sonnet 4.6, and OpenAI&#39;s GPT-5.2 and GPT-5.3-Codex in the majority of cited benchmarks, Google&#39;s chart shows. However, Opus 4.6 retains the top score for Humanity&#39;s Last Exam (full set, test + MM), SWE-Bench Verified, and τ²-bench. And GPT-5.3-Codex leads in SWE-Bench Pro (Public) and Terminal-Bench 2.0 when evaluated using Codex’s own harness rather than the standard Terminus-2 agent harness.

&quot;3.1 Pro is designed for tasks where a simple answer isn&#39;t enough, taking advanced reasoning and making it useful for your hardest challenges,&quot; the Gemini team said. &quot;This improved intelligence can help in practical applications – whether you&#39;re looking for a clear, visual explanation of a complex topic, a way to synthesize data into a single view, or bringing a creative project to life.&quot;

To illustrate potential uses, the Gemini team points to how the model can create website-ready SVG animations and can translate the literary style of a novel into the design of a personal portfolio site.

In the company&#39;s Q4 2025 earnings release [PDF], CEO Sundar Pichai said, &quot;Our first party models, like Gemini, now process over 10 billion tokens per minute via direct API use by our customers, and the Gemini App has grown to over 750 million monthly active users.&quot;

Google is making Gemini 3.1 Pro available via the Gemini API in Google AI Studio, Gemini CLI, Antigravity, and Android Studio. Enterprise customers can access it via Vertex AI and Gemini Enterprise while consumers can do so via the Gemini app and NotebookLM.

The model is also accessible via several Microsoft services including GitHub Copilot, Visual Studio, and Visual Studio Code. ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The US Congress’ spending watchdog, the Government Accountability Office, has pressed the National Science Foundation’s CIO to improve how the agency plans, manages, and procures technology.

The “open recommendations” were outlined in a letter dated February 12 and sent to NSF CIO Clyde Richards before being published on Thursday.

It said: &quot;We identified recommendations that relate to the CIO’s roles and responsibilities in effectively managing IT.” Paying attention to them “will help ensure the effective use of IT at the agency.&quot;

Put bluntly, &quot;NSF needs to improve its acquisition of cloud services and its reviews of the agency’s IT portfolio.&quot;

This includes developing guidance &quot;regarding standardizing cloud service-level agreements.&quot;

The GAO believes that the NSF should &quot;consistently&quot; hold cloud service providers accountable for performance, with clear SLAs and remediation plans for non-compliance. The GAO wants to see an SLA with every cloud vendor, and recommends the CIO develop guidance standardizing such SLAs.

It also wants an overhaul of contracts for &quot;high value assets that are managed and operated in the cloud.&quot; And recommends that the agency complete &quot;annual reviews of its IT portfolio consistent with federal requirements&quot; to identify areas of duplication and ways of streamlining operations and optimizing resource allocation.

The letter also mentions &quot;multiple open recommendations in the area of cybersecurity,&quot; referring to the Federal Information Security Modernization Act of 2014.

The letter was cc’d to the Federal CIO, Gregory Barbaccia of the OMB, who is on a mission to drive down costs and standardize procurement across the government.

Richards was named CIO at the foundation seven months ago, after serving in the role on an &quot;acting&quot; basis for five months. He originally joined as deputy CIO in March 2024, having previously worked at the Defense Counterintelligence and Security Agency, following various roles in and around the military.

The NSF manages a budget of around $9 billion – it just dodged a massive 60 percent round of cuts proposed by the Trump administration – which is directed to a range of scientific disciplines.

Needless to say, it has a sprawling IT infrastructure, and an ongoing transformation program.

It is currently transferring management of the NCAR-Wyoming Supercomputing Center to a third-party operator. Other projects include a plan for a National Artificial Intelligence Research Resource Operations Center.

Last year, it awarded a $20 million grant to expand its CloudBank initiative, designed to give researchers, especially at smaller institutions, access to commercial cloud computing.

According to GAO, CIO open recommendations are &quot;outstanding&quot; ones requiring CIO attention that, if implemented, could significantly improve government IT operations, including strengthening security, cutting costs, and ensuring compliance.

Last year, the GAO delivered over a dozen recommendations on the Department of Veterans Affairs&#39; health records upgrade program.

Some dated back to 2020, but it&#39;s worth remembering that the current upgrade program only began in 2017 – and was the fourth attempt to modernize the 30-year-old system. ®

            <div id="article-text">Brian Boland testified about shifting from “deep blind faith” in Meta, to becoming its public critic.

Brian Boland testified about shifting from “deep blind faith” in Meta, to becoming its public critic.

Brian Boland spent more than a decade figuring out how to build a system that would make Meta money. On Thursday, he told a California jury it incentivized drawing more and more users, including teens, onto Facebook and Instagram — despite the risks.

Boland’s testimony came a day after Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg took the stand in a case over whether Meta and YouTube are liable for allegedly harming a young woman’s mental health. Zuckerberg framed Meta’s mission as balancing safety with free expression, not revenue. Boland’s role was to counter this by explaining how Meta makes money, and how that shaped its platforms’ design. Boland testified that Zuckerberg fostered a culture that prioritized growth and profit over users’ wellbeing from the top down. He said he’s been described as a whistleblower — a term Meta has broadly sought to limit for fear it would prejudice the jury, but which the judge has generally allowed. Over his 11 years at Meta, Boland said he went from having “deep blind faith” in the company to coming to the “firm belief that competition and power and growth were the things that Mark Zuckerberg cared about most.”

Boland last served as Meta’s VP of partnerships before leaving in 2020, working to bring content to the platform that it could monetize, and previously worked in a variety of advertising roles beginning in 2009. He testified that Facebook’s infamous early slogan of “move fast and break things” represented “a cultural ethos at the company.” He said the idea behind the motto was generally, “don’t really think about what could go wrong with a product, but just get it out there and learn and see.” At the height of its prominence internally, employees would sit down at their desks to see a piece of paper that said, “what will you break today?” Boland testified.

“The priorities were on winning growth and engagement”

Zuckerberg consistently made his priorities for the company abundantly clear, according to Boland. He’d announce them in all hands meetings and leave no shadow of a doubt what the company should be focused on, whether it was building its products to be mobile-first, or getting ahead of the competition. When Zuckerberg realized that then-Facebook had to get into shape to compete with a rumored Google social network competitor (which he didn’t name, but seemed to refer to Google+), Boland recalled a digital countdown clock in the office that symbolized how much time they had left to achieve their goals during what the company called a “lockdown.” During his time at the company, Boland testified, there was never a lockdown around user safety, and Zuckerberg allegedly instilled in engineers that “the priorities were on winning growth and engagement.”

Meta has repeatedly denied that it tries to maximize users’ engagement on its platforms over safeguarding their wellbeing. In the past weeks, both Zuckerberg and Instagram CEO Adam Mosseri testified that building platforms that users enjoy and feel good on is in their long-term interest, and that’s what drives their decisions.

Boland disputes this. “My experience was that when there were opportunities to really try to understand what the products might be doing harmfully in the world, that those were not the priority,” he testified. “Those were more of a problem than an opportunity to fix.”

When safety issues came up through press reports or regulatory questions, Boland said, “the primary response was to figure out how to manage through the press cycle, to what the media was saying, as opposed to saying, ‘let’s take a step back and really deeply understand.” Though Boland said he told his advertising-focused team that they should be the ones to discover “broken parts,” rather than those outside the company, he said that philosophy didn’t extend to the rest of the company.

On the stand the day before, Zuckerberg pointed to documents around 2019 showing disagreement among his employees with his decisions, saying they demonstrated a culture that encourages a diversity of opinion. Boland, however, testified that while that might have been the case earlier in his tenure, it later became “a very closed down culture.”

“There’s not a moral algorithm, that’s not a thing … Doesn’t eat, doesn’t sleep, doesn’t care”

Since the jury can only consider decisions and products that Meta itself made, rather than content it hosted from users, lead plaintiff attorney Mark Lanier also had Boland describe how Meta’s algorithm works, and the decisions that went into making and testing it. Algorithms have an “immense amount of power,” Boland said, and are “absolutely relentless” in pursuing their programmed goals — in many cases at Meta, that was allegedly engagement. “There’s not a moral algorithm, that’s not a thing,” Boland said. “Doesn’t eat, doesn’t sleep, doesn’t care.”

During his testimony on Wednesday, Zuckerberg commented that Boland “developed some strong political opinions” toward the end of his time at the company. (Neither Zuckerberg nor Boland offered specifics, but in a 2025 blog post, Boland indicated he was deleting his Facebook account in part over disagreements with how Meta handled events like January 6th, writing that he believed “Facebook had contributed to spreading ‘Stop the Steal’ propaganda and enabling this attempted coup.”) Lanier spent time establishing that Boland was respected by peers, showing a CNBC article about his departure that quoted a glowing statement from his then-boss, and a reference to an unnamed source who reportedly described Boland as someone with a strong moral character.

On cross examination, Meta attorney Phyllis Jones clarified that Boland didn’t work on the teams tasked with understanding youth safety at the company. Boland agreed that advertising business models are not inherently bad, and neither are algorithms. He also admitted that many of his concerns involved the content users were posting, which is not relevant to the current case.

During his direct examination, Lanier asked if Boland had ever expressed his concerns to Zuckerberg directly. Boland said he’d told the CEO he’d seen concerning data showing “harmful outcomes” of the company’s algorithms and suggested that they investigate further. He recalled Zuckerberg responding something to the effect of, “I hope there’s still things you’re proud of.” Soon after, he said, he quit.

Boland said he left upwards of $10 million worth of unvested Meta stock on the table when he departed, though he admitted he made more than that over the years. He said he still finds it “nerve-wracking” every time he speaks out about the company. “This is an incredibly powerful company,” he said.

            <div id="article-text">HBO’s medical drama has been teasing out a smart story about what makes gen AI so tempting and concerning.﻿

HBO’s medical drama has been teasing out a smart story about what makes gen AI so tempting and concerning.﻿

Each episode of HBO’s The Pitt features some degree of medical trauma that almost makes the hospital drama feel like a horror series. Some patients are dealing with gnarly lacerations while others are fighting off vicious blood infections that could rob them of their limbs, and the chaos of working in an emergency room often leaves The Pitt’s central characters shaken. But as alarming as many of The Pitt’s more gore-forward moments can be, what’s even more unsettling is the show’s slow-burning subplot about hospitals adopting generative artificial intelligence.

In its second season, The Pitt once again chronicles all the events that happen during a single 15-hour day shift in the Pittsburgh Trauma Medical Center’s emergency room. Season two takes place on the Fourth of July — one of the busiest days for hospitals — as senior attending physician Dr. Michael “Robby” Robinavitch (Noah Wyle) is working one last shift before he takes a much-needed sabbatical. With Dr. Robby scheduled to be away for three months, the hospital brings in Dr. Baran Al-Hashimi (Sepideh Moafi) to help lead the emergency room while he’s away. There’s some personality-based friction between the attendings, but Dr. Robby mostly respects how Dr. Al-Hashimi navigates her work except when she insists that the hospital would be better off if it committed to using a piece of AI-powered transcription software.

Though this season starts off relatively calm, the day becomes increasingly stressful for all of The Pitt’s characters as the hospital becomes filled with people needing medical attention. Staying on top of her work is especially taxing for second-year resident Dr. Trinity Santos (Isa Briones) because she simply doesn’t have enough time to see all of her patients and carefully note all of their symptoms in their medical charts.

Dr. Al-Hashimi knows that AI-generated transcripts aren’t perfect, but she sees Dr. Santos as the perfect example of a doctor who could get through their charting faster with the technology’s help. To the fictional software’s credit, it does accurately transcribe most of Dr. Santos’ dictation. But both doctors are stunned when a surgeon storms into the ER in a rage after receiving charts with very obvious, glaring errors that could have led to patients receiving incorrect care.

Rather than running headlong into a “generative AI is bad and dangerous” ripped-from-the-headlines plot, The Pitt has taken its time to explore the reasons why medical professionals might want to use this kind of technology and the importance of looking at it with some skepticism. Dr. Al-Hashimi encourages her medical students and residents to use the transcription software, but she’s also diligent about warning them that they need to double-check any work completed with AI because they — not their tools — are responsible for how patients are treated. Each of Dr. Al-Hashimi’s warnings come across as The Pitt acknowledging real-world instances of patients suing hospitals over botched surgeries involving the use of AI tools and studies that have found large language models to be unreliable in their ability to accurately predict patient health outcomes. The Pitt also uses Dr. Al-Hashimi’s AI boosterism to hammer home how adopting the technology in professional settings can actually create more busywork (see: double-checking transcriptions) while contributing to people burning out. Initially, Dr. Al-Hashimi seems like she might be a major antagonistic presence this season, but The Pitt’s writing team has very smartly chosen to focus on a bigger idea.

This season of The Pitt has been repeatedly emphasizing that technology can only do so much to solve problems when it isn’t really designed to address the real issue at hand. AI-powered transcription can help Dr. Santos finish charts more quickly (with some errors thrown in for good measure). But the software can’t do much about the emergency room being understaffed, or when the doctors and nurses are suddenly tasked with taking in more patients after another hospital goes on lockdown.

The way characters like Dr. Santos and nurses like Dana Evans (Katherine LaNasa) find themselves inundated with demanding patients who have spent hours in overstuffed waiting rooms feels like a direct reflection of the real-world challenges hospitals across the country are facing. To truly get a hold on their workloads, The Pitt’s ER staff really needs more hands on deck and more space to give patients the appropriate care. But with the country facing a nursing shortage and the fictional hospital being perpetually underfunded, it tracks that administrators would want to try boosting productivity using AI.

The Pitt easily could (and still might before the season’s over) tell a story about how errors caused by using gen AI lead to mistakes in operating rooms that can leave medical professionals open to lawsuits. But the show is right for highlighting the reality that there are some critical workplace issues that can’t be fixed simply by throwing new kinds of technology at them.

Fulu wants developers to come up with a solution that will allow users to store Ring doorbell footage locally on devices.

With Ring facing fierce backlash over its Search Party feature, a new program is challenging developers to move Ring doorbell footage off of Amazon’s cloud — and into users’ own devices. The Fulu Foundation, the consumer advocacy group cofounded by YouTuber Louis Rossmann, is offering an initial bounty of $10,000 to anyone who can integrate Ring doorbells with a local PC or server, while cutting off access to Amazon’s servers.

Ring users currently have to pay a subscription fee to store recordings in Amazon’s cloud. While the company has a local storage option through Ring Edge, it’s only available with the Ring Alarm Pro, and it still requires a subscription. There’s also an option to secure your videos with end-to-end encryption, meaning neither Ring nor third parties can see your footage, but it’s stored on Amazon’s servers.

Now Fulu is hoping someone can give users more control over their footage, following the concerns raised by Ring’s Super Bowl ad for Search Party, an AI-powered feature that uses its network of doorbells to find lost dogs (and maybe to eventually combat crime). Though there are several other smart home brands, including Eufy, Reolink, and Aqara, that offer video doorbells with local storage, Fulu cofounder Kevin O’Reilly says device owners shouldn’t be expected to replace their hardware when concerns stem from software.

“In an ideal world, device owners would be able to modify that software to instead push that footage to their own computer or server, should they so choose,” O’Reilly writes. However, he warns that bounty solutions will be limited by the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, which “means distributing a tool or mechanism for other security-minded Ring owners to circumvent those locks and assert their ownership over their video remains a copyright crime.”

The first person or team to submit a solution that meets Fulu’s eligibility requirements will win the bounty. To qualify, developers must integrate Ring doorbells released in 2021 or later with a local computer or server, and ensure it “no longer sends data to Amazon servers or requires connection to Amazon hardware to function.” The initial bounty starts at $10,000, and Fulu will match any additional donations made by supporters up to $10,000.

It’s hard to buy a bad pair of wireless earbuds these days, and with constant discounts and deals wherever you look, now is as good a time as any to splurge on the pair you’ve been eyeing. The market has come a long way since the early era of true wireless earbuds, when we had to deal with mediocre sound quality and unreliable performance, all for the sake of ditching cables. Things are much different now. After several product generations, companies like Sony, Apple, Bose, and others are releasing their most impressive earbuds to date.

You can get phenomenal noise cancellation and sound quality in the premium tier of earbuds if you’re willing to spend big. But those aren’t always the most important criteria for everyone: maybe you’re looking for the perfect fitness earbuds or for a set that works just as well for Zoom calls as for playing your favorite playlists and podcasts.

Tech companies are increasingly making their earbuds work best with their own products through exclusive features and functionality, so that’s another thing to consider as you shop around. If you want a perk like head-tracking spatial audio, you’ll need to use AirPods with an iPhone, Samsung buds with a Samsung phone, and so on.

Smaller, more comfortable designUpgrades to ANC and sound qualityMuch clearer voice call performance

Glossy texture can make them harder to remove from caseSony’s bonus features aren’t as seamless as those of its competitors

Noise cancellation: Yes / Battery life: 8 hours (ANC on) / Water resistance: IPX4 / Bluetooth codecs: LDAC, AAC, SBC / Multipoint: Yes / Works best with: Android, iOS, Windows, macOS / Ear tips: Foam (XS, S, M, L)

Despite the recent arrival of Sony’s WF-1000XM6 earbuds, the last-gen WF-1000XM5 remain our top recommendation for the best noise-canceling earbuds overall. Thanks to their larger drivers, audio quality is more detailed and dynamic than before while still retaining the warmth and clarity that made the WF-1000XM4 so enjoyable. They also deliver fantastic active noise cancellation, even if it’s not quite as impressive as it is on the newer XM6 or Bose’s Ultra Earbuds gen 2. The XM5 do a terrific job of eliminating background noise, and battery life can stretch to eight hours with ANC turned on.

Some people found the XM4 bulky and uncomfortable, but Sony has managed to shrink the XM5 by 25 percent (the XM6 are longer and narrower). Like before, the company includes foam-style tips that expand in your ears to create an excellent seal — and there’s even a fourth (extra small) set of tips in the box.

On Android phones, the 1000XM5 support Sony’s LDAC codec for higher-quality music playback. And they’re capable of dynamic head tracking spatial audio through supported video apps like Netflix. But even if you’re not using LDAC (or have an iPhone), these are up there with the very best audio-focused premium earbuds — including Sennheiser’s Momentum True Wireless 4, only with substantially better noise cancellation. They’re also capable of multipoint Bluetooth connectivity, so you can pair them with two devices at the same time.

None of that to say the newer XM6 are a bad choice — quite the contrary, actually. Sony’s latest flagships offer improved sound, handle ambient noise better during calls, and deliver some of the best ANC you can get in a pair of wireless earbuds. But they’re also bulkier and pricier than the XM5 given the latter can often be found on sale for around $250, making the last-gen model a better option for most people.

Standout color and designVery compact carrying caseGreat performer for the price

Limited retail availabilityPlastic case can show scuffs

Noise cancellation: Yes / Battery life: 5.5 hours (ANC on) / Water resistance: IP54 / Bluetooth codecs: LDAC, AAC, SBC / Multipoint: Yes / Works best with: Android, iOS, Windows, macOS / Ear tips: Silicone (S, M, L)

When looking at Nothing’s Ear (a) earbuds, it’s easy to focus all your attention on the catchy yellow color or their fun, super compact carrying case. But at their $99 price, the company’s entry-level earbuds provide a ton of features, including active noise cancellation, a low-latency mode for gaming, multipoint Bluetooth pairing, and a decent IP54 dust and water resistance rating.

And the sound quality you get outperforms my usual expectations for this price point, especially since they often can be found for as little as $60. They’re not quite on par with Nothing’s higher-end Ear 3, but you do get expressive, very enjoyable audio — and you can customize the EQ further in Nothing’s mobile app.

Exceptional ANCSecure fitWireless charging case

Noise cancellation: Yes / Battery life: 6 hours (ANC on) / Water resistance: IPX4 / Bluetooth codecs: AAC, SBC, aptX Adaptive / Multipoint: Yes / Works best with: Android, iOS, Windows, macOS / Ear tips: Silicone (S, M, L)

The name Bose has been synonymous with noise cancellation for decades, and it’s again proven why with the QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds (Gen 2). They offer the best noise-canceling performance available in a set of earbuds, delivering the peace and isolation many of us crave throughout the day. The second-gen model bring some much-needed improvements to call quality, too, and while they don’t match the performance of our best call quality picks, the AirPods 4 or Samsung Galaxy Buds, the Bose handle noisy environments far better and allow you to sound like you in conversations.

Although Bose added wireless charging and there’s now a little screen in the ear tips to keep earwax out of the earbuds, there’s no visual upgrade to speak of. The second-gen earbuds maintain a chunky look that’s identical to the first-gen QC Ultra Earbuds, which were already extremely similar to 2022’s QC Earbuds II. They come with three ear tips and three stabilizer sizes, providing a variety of combinations and a secure fit for different ear shapes.

As with the design, the QC Ultra Earbuds (Gen 2) sound nearly identical to their first-gen counterpart. The bass and treble are boosted, providing more bass than competitors and a lively high-end — although it can get to be a bit much on some tracks. Bose continues to stick with its three-band EQ in the app, which doesn’t allow much meaningful adjustment, but most people will appreciate the stock sound. Bose also continues to offer Immersive Audio, first introduced with the Ultra Earbuds, which is similar to Apple’s spatial audio.

Huzzah! Wireless charging!Adds ANC, transparency modes, spatial audioSlimmer ear hook, smaller caseAdds heart rateGreat soundNo price hike

Case is still a chonkerHeart rate is not that useful for iOS users

Noise cancellation: Yes / Battery life: 8 hours (ANC on) / Water resistance: IPX4 / Bluetooth codecs: AAC, SBC / Multipoint: No / Works best with: Android, iOS, Windows, macOS / Ear tips: Silicone (XS, S, M, L, XL)

After a long wait, Beats finally introduced the Powerbeats Pro 2 in early 2025. They carry forward the signature ear hook design of past Powerbeats earbuds, but improve upon the original Powerbeats Pro in several key ways. Beats added active noise cancellation and a natural-sounding transparency mode to the Pro 2; the first-gen pair lacked both. The earbuds themselves are lighter, too, and the charging case is noticeably smaller.

The Powerbeats Pro 2 also feature heart rate monitoring thanks to built-in sensors on each earbud. You might already have a fitness tracker, chest strap, or smartwatch for this purpose, but if not, you can use these with compatible apps like Nike Run Club, Runna, Ladder, Slopes, Open, Peloton, and YaoYao. The downside is that they can’t simultaneously play music and broadcast heart rate to gym equipment when paired to an iOS device, rendering the Pro 2 a better heart rate monitoring alternative for Android users than iPhone users.

The Powerbeats Pro 2 remain rated IPX4 for water resistance. While that’s not as robust as some other fitness-focused buds, it should be sufficient to survive sweat and outdoor runs in various conditions. The earbuds still offer easy-to-use physical buttons and a dedicated volume rocker, so it’s easy to control them in the middle of a workout.

If you’re an iPhone owner, the Powerbeats Pro 2 earbuds include Apple-only features like dynamic head tracking for spatial audio, auto device switching, Find My integration, and more. For Android users, Beats has an app that packs in a smaller subset of these functions.

Improved ANC and soundLonger batteryStandalone workout trackingLive translationSame priceIP57Better fitCamera remote control is handy!

If you’re hoping for traditional foam ear tips, this isn’t that

Noise cancellation: Yes / Battery life: 8 hours (ANC on) / Water resistance: IP57 / Bluetooth codecs: AAC, SBC / Multipoint: No / Works best with: iOS, macOS / Ear tips: Silicone (XXS, XS, S, M, L)

Apple continually adds to the features of the AirPods Pro line — either with a new product like the second-gen AirPods Pro, or with a software update, such as the one that introduced the hearing health features at the end of 2024. The AirPods Pro 3 continue the trend, with improved noise-canceling performance, heart rate sensing, newly designed ear tips with an extra XXS size, and longer battery life. The splashiest update is Live Translation, which, unlike the other improvements, still needs some time to develop into a more streamlined experience.

The new foam-infused earbuds improve passive isolation and, when combined with better ANC performance, deliver the best overall noise cancellation in a pair of Apple earbuds yet. ANC performance is nearly identical to that of the Bose QC Ultra Earbuds (Gen 2), but the AirPods have a slight high-end hiss (though some people might not notice it). A redesign of the acoustic architecture gives the AirPods Pro 3 improved bass performance over the second-gen model, and its spatial audio delivers a wider, richer listening experience.

But what’s important for many Apple users is how well the AirPods Pro 3 fit into the Apple ecosystem. A new heart sensor, first seen with the Powerbeats Pro 2, enables heart rate tracking for 50 workout types from directly within the iOS Fitness app. And unlike the Powerbeats Pro 2, the AirPods can work in conjunction with the Apple Watch, providing a secondary heart rate stream to ensure you always have the most accurate data.

Terrific sound qualityCrisp, natural transparency / passthrough modeVoice commands are simple and so usefulGood voice calls

Samsung’s Galaxy Buds 3 Pro ditch the company’s more discreet designs of the past for a stemmed style that’s similar to AirPods and any number of other wireless earbuds. Boring? Maybe, but thanks to that change, we’ve found them to be more comfortable and provide better stability than the Buds 2 Pro. The sound quality is even better than before — and it was already excellent. These are right up there with Sennheiser and Technics from an audio fidelity standpoint.

The Buds 3 Pro are also a standout performer when it comes to call quality. And our favorite thing about these earbuds are the hands-free voice commands that don’t require you to say any specific wake phrase beforehand. You can just say “volume up” and / or “next song,” and it happens.

But they’re not perfect: the Buds 3 Pro lack multipoint connectivity, so they can’t connect to two devices at the same time. Just like Apple, Samsung prefers to automatically hop between products within its own walled garden ecosystem. Some people might consider this a dealbreaker, but we’ve still enjoyed the earbuds plenty without it.

Smaller and lighter design is supremely comfortableMore powerful noise cancellationCrystal-clear transparency modeVery pleasant and detailed sound quality

ANC can’t quite match BoseGoogle still refuses to add higher-quality Bluetooth codecs, limiting overall fidelityGemini Live feels more feeble than futuristic

With the Pixel Buds Pro 2, Google has addressed most of the downsides of the original pair. They’re far smaller and lighter than the chunky first-gen Pixel Buds Pro. And there’s a small nub on the buds to help keep them in place while performing various activities, including running and other forms of intensive exercise.

Google’s active noise cancellation still isn’t on the same tier as Bose, but the transparency mode on the Buds Pro 2 is among the very best you’ll find. It offers a crisp, natural passthrough for the outside world when needed. Multipoint support is included, and Google’s latest pair of premium earbuds eke out impressive battery life that surpasses most competitors.

Got a Pixel phone? With the Pixel Buds Pro 2, you can have lengthy conversations with Google’s Gemini AI while your phone stays in your pocket. Features like head-tracking spatial audio and Clear Calling are also exclusive to those within the Pixel ecosystem. If that’s you, the Pixel Buds Pro 2 are a big step up from the previous buds in a much smaller package.

Better sound, ANC, and battery life than Studio BudsStandout translucent case optionImproved voice call performance

ANC and transparency fall short of the AirPods Pro 3Doesn’t offer all Apple ecosystem tricksNo wireless charging or in-ear detection

Noise cancellation: Yes / Battery life: 6 hours (ANC on) / Water resistance: IPX4 / Bluetooth codecs: AAC, SBC / Multipoint: No / Works best with: Android, iOS, Windows, macOS / Ear tips: Silicone (XS, S, M, L)

Beats’ Studio Buds Plus are an upgraded, better-performing revision of the Studio Buds released in 2021. This time, the company has made the noise cancellation more powerful while also improving the quality of the transparency mode and extending battery life. If you’re going for style points, it doesn’t get much cooler than the translucent color option. These earbuds are very tiny and rank among the best in terms of overall comfort.

What’s interesting about the Studio Buds Plus is that they use a proprietary chip that allows them to support native software features on both iOS and Android. Plenty of earbuds offer companion apps on each platform, but in the case of the Beats, they work with both Apple’s Find My and Google’s Find Hub networks. You also get simple one-tap pairing, no matter which operating system you’re using.

The drawback to this dual-ecosystem life is that Apple customers don’t get all the usual bells and whistles that come with AirPods or even the Beats Powerbeats Pro 2; you lose out on audio sharing, head tracking spatial audio, and other tricks. Wireless charging and an ear detection sensor (for auto-pause when a bud is removed) are also MIA, which stings a bit considering the price.

Fantastic sound qualityImproved day-to-day reliabilityAuracast-enabled

Too pricey for someNoise cancellation does the job, but isn’t anything specialLong-term durability remains to be seen

Noise cancellation: Yes / Battery life: 7.5 hours (ANC on) / Water resistance: IP54 / Bluetooth codecs: AptX Adaptive, AptX, AAC, SBC / Multipoint: Yes / Works best with: Android, iOS, Windows, macOS / Ear tips: Silicone (XS, S, M, L)

Sennheiser’s Momentum True Wireless earbuds have always sounded fantastic; that’s never been the issue. But previous models in the series have been tainted a bit by bugs, unsteady performance, and battery reliability problems. The fourth-gen pair finally gets that part right while continuing to offer tremendous, detailed sound quality that stands above nearly all competitors. They’re a joy to listen to. The active noise cancellation can’t compete with the likes of Apple, Sony, and Bose, but if you care more about lush, intricate sound, the MTW4 won’t disappoint in the slightest.

These earbuds come with optional wing tips to help keep them securely locked in your ears. That could prove helpful for running or when hitting the gym. Sennheiser allows for plenty of EQ customization using its mobile app, and the Momentum True Wireless 4 support a range of Bluetooth codecs, including AAC, SBC, AptX, and AptX Adaptive. They’re even LE Audio and Auracast-ready for when those features become more widespread.

Upgraded sound qualityVoice isolation can noticeably improve call clarityDeep Apple ecosystem integration

No wireless chargingNo built-in speaker on the caseNo proper multipoint

Noise cancellation: Optional / Battery life: 5 hours / Water resistance: IP54 / Bluetooth codecs: AAC, SBC / Multipoint: No / Works best with: iOS, Windows, macOS / Ear tips: None

Apple’s AirPods 4 come in two different versions, with a higher-priced option that includes active noise cancellation and wireless charging. But sound quality is identical on both sets, and equally as important in this case is that the same can be said of voice call clarity.

On the AirPods 4, there’s a new “voice isolation” feature — enabled by default — that uses machine learning both on the earbuds and your iPhone to eliminate distracting background noise on your end so that you come through clearly to whoever you’re speaking with.

Overall call quality is excellent with the AirPods 4. And beyond that, compared to the third-gen model, you can expect upgraded audio quality (with richer bass), new ways of interacting with Siri through head movements, and yes... there’s a USB-C connector on the included charging case, as opposed to a Lightning port.

The AirPods still have a one-size-fits-most hard plastic form factor, so we recommend trying them before committing to a purchase. However, Apple says it used more than 50 million data points to further refine the contours and overall stability of its latest earbuds. So, if previous models worked well for you, these seem like a safe bet. The only question is whether you feel like spending a little more to gain ANC, a transparency mode, wireless charging, and a built-in speaker for Find My location tracking.

Sony’s unconventional LinkBuds were our longtime pick for the clearest voice calls on Android, but we still haven’t had the chance to review their successors. For now, the aforementioned Galaxy Buds 3 Pro are an easy-to-recommend choice. The built-in “voice pickup unit” detects the movement of your mouth to help isolate your voice from background noise and keep conversations clear.

The Buds 3 Pro have proven dependable for us during video chats on Google Meet and Zoom, and people have been able to hear us without issue, even when answering a quick call on the street.

Whether you’re using earbuds to check out a newly-released album on Spotify, as motivation at the gym, or to tune out distractions around the office, they must deliver on the key metrics of sound quality, noise cancellation, voice call performance, and more. We spend many hours putting our picks through the paces. This includes quiet listening sessions that reveal their full detail, overall fidelity, and dynamics. We also take these buds out into the real world — on rush hour subway commutes, around busy cities, and in crowded cafes — to gauge their connection strength and determine how effectively they can quiet the world around you. We test them on video calls at work and by calling friends and family, who provide blunt feedback on how their mics sound. And importantly, because earbud makers often reserve certain software tricks for their preferred ecosystems, we see how the earbuds fare when used across multiple platforms.

No matter how they sound, what good are earbuds if you don’t enjoy wearing them? Ears come in all shapes and sizes, so the comfort factor is highly subjective. Most of our picks include several sizes of ear tips; usually they’re silicone, but some companies use foam (or both). Again, which you like better comes down to personal preference. Silicone tips are more common, but foam can expand to fill more of your ear for a better seal. The most important tip we can offer is to try different-sized tips in each ear: you might find that one ear needs a bigger or smaller tip than the other.

Just like with comfort, we all have our own inclinations for what we want from sound quality. Some people are bass-heads who can’t live without a thumping low end. Personally, we care more about dynamics, clarity, and definition from the music we’re listening to. We want vocals to ring through naturally and instruments to be well separated in the sound stage. We look for earbuds that can bring out the subtle details in our favorite songs.

What was once a luxury feature is now the status quo. Many of our top picks include active noise cancellation to help quiet the raucous outside world. Whether you’re trying to concentrate at the office or rest while traveling, noise cancellation can be a huge help. However, some people hate the “plugged up” feeling of earbuds and prefer open-style buds that help maintain full awareness of their surroundings.

Most earbuds these days offer between five and six hours of continuous battery life with ANC enabled. Some models can exceed that (and over-ear headphones tend to last much longer on a charge), but the convenience of being able to just pop your earbuds back into their case for more juice makes the tradeoff easier to live with.

Even if you don’t intend to use your earbuds for fitness purposes, there’s always a chance of getting caught out in the rain while wearing them. At a minimum, you should look for earbuds with IPX4 water resistance. This safeguards them from splashes of water (and sweat), so they should be cut out for the hazards of daily life.

Update, February 19th: Updated to reflect current pricing / availability and mention Sony’s newer WF-1000XM6 earbuds. Brandon Widder also contributed to this post.

            <div id="article-text">﻿Horizon Worlds is now going to be a platform that’s ‘almost exclusively mobile.’

﻿Horizon Worlds is now going to be a platform that’s ‘almost exclusively mobile.’

Meta, after laying off about 10 percent of its Reality Labs division, closing three VR studios, stopping new content for VR fitness app Supernatural, and discontinuing its metaverse for work, is announcing a major change for its Horizon Worlds metaverse platform. Instead of attempting to make the 3D social platform work for both VR and mobile, Meta is “explicitly separating” its “Quest VR platform from our Worlds platform” and “shifting the focus of Worlds to be almost exclusively mobile,” Samantha Ryan, Reality Labs’ VP of content, says in a blog post.

The new approach sets Meta up to better compete with platforms like Roblox and Fortnite, which also offer user-generated experiences that can be played on your phone. Horizon Worlds originally launched for VR, but “to truly change the game and tap into a much larger market, we’re going all-in on mobile.”

“We’re in a strong position to deliver synchronous social games at scale, thanks to our unique ability to connect those games with billions of people on the world’s biggest social networks,” Ryan says. “You saw this strategy start to unfold in 2025, and now, it’s our main focus.”

As for VR software, Ryan says Meta is focusing on supporting third-party developers. “While we’re proud of the world-class work from Oculus Studios over the years, among 1P and 3P apps, 86% of the effective time people spend in their VR headsets is with third-party apps.”

But Meta is still planning to make VR hardware; “we have a robust roadmap of future VR headsets that will be tailored to different audience segments as the market grows and matures,” according to Ryan. (That new hardware, which could include a new mainline Quest headset, might cost a higher price.)

Meta CTO Andrew Bosworth made similar comments about Meta’s shift in strategy in a recent episode of the Access podcast, which is hosted by former Verge staffer Alex Heath.

After the not-so-successful bet on the metaverse, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg now sees AI as the new social media, a vision that could include AI-generated games that users can share with others on their feeds. “There are 3D versions of that, and there are 2D versions of that and Horizon, I think, fits very well with the kind of immersive 3D version of that,” Zuckerberg said on the company’s latest earnings call.

Ring founder Jamie Siminoff has been on an “explanation tour,” as The New York Times puts it, following the fallout from its Super Bowl ad and the introduction of its Search Party feature.

In an interview with The Times this week, Siminoff explained that he understands people’s concerns and that “maybe people were ‘triggered’ by an image in the ad that showed blue rings radiating out from suburban homes. There will be fewer maps in any future ads, he said.”

Graphics in ads are not the problem. The problem is the potential for Ring’s vast network of AI-powered camera technology to be turned into a surveillance tool, one accessible to law enforcement and capable of creating a record of people’s movements that’s searchable by AI (which itself raises concerns around reliability and hallucination). Ring is the only home security camera company to have built a system — called Community Requests — that allows its users to share footage directly with local police.

Ring maintains that its cameras are not being used to create a mass surveillance tool. According to the company, its privacy protections are robust, and users are fully in control of their videos, including whether they share them with law enforcement. But the company still hasn’t fully addressed its users’ fears.

Rather than continue to push his narrative that cameras will solve crime, Siminoff needs to acknowledge the real concerns people have and make it clear how far Ring is willing to take this powerful technology. He needs to explain where — and how — he will draw the line. Will Search Party stop at tracking humans?

Instead, he’s doubling down on the ideas that more cameras are good and more video in the world is better — not surprising from someone who makes money by selling cameras. But he also told The Times that he thinks most people feel this way, even if they say otherwise.

“There’s been a lot of cases recently where if the video had not been there, I’m not sure if the story would have been told the same or we wouldn’t have known what happened,” he told The Times, adding that what Ring does is “not just like unfettered mass surveillance.”

The other concern is around what happens to its video after users share it with the police. While that’s arguably not Ring’s problem, the company has acknowledged that its mission “to make neighborhoods safer” carries significant responsibility. It created this technology and needs to ensure it’s used responsibly.

The argument that camera owners have complete control of how their footage is shared puts the onus on the user. But Ring turned Search Party on by default for everyone, demonstrating that it has the control. There’s also no guarantee that any current default settings will stay that way. Additionally, while the user can choose to share footage, the people captured by the cameras don’t necessarily have that choice.

Ring has cancelled its controversial partnership with Flock Safety, a law enforcement technology company linked with sharing footage with ICE, but its Community Requests tool is still going. As is its partnership with Axon, another law enforcement technology company, known for Tasers, whose digital evidence management system is widely used by law enforcement agencies, including Customs and Border Protection.

Siminoff confirmed to The Times that Ring will continue building out Search Party, saying that they’re looking to add searching for cats to its capabilities. But then, what comes next?

All this technology is coming together at lightning speed, and to many, it feels like it’s just one turn away from a dystopian surveillance system.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">AI-enabled deception now permeates our online lives. There are the high-profile cases you may easily spot, like when White House officials recently shared a manipulated image of a protester in Minnesota and then mocked those asking about it. Other times, it slips quietly into social media feeds and racks up views, like the videos that Russian influence campaigns are currently spreading to discourage Ukrainians from enlisting.

It is into this mess that Microsoft has put forward a blueprint, shared with MIT Technology Review, for how to prove what’s real online.

An AI safety research team at the company recently evaluated how methods for documenting digital manipulation are faring against today’s most worrying AI developments, like interactive deepfakes and widely accessible hyperrealistic models. It then recommended technical standards that can be adopted by AI companies and social media platforms.

To understand the gold standard that Microsoft is pushing, imagine you have a Rembrandt painting and you are trying to document its authenticity. You might describe its provenance with a detailed manifest of where the painting came from and all the times it changed hands. You might apply a watermark that would be invisible to humans but readable by a machine. And you could digitally scan the painting and generate a mathematical signature, like a fingerprint, based on the brush strokes. If you showed the piece at a museum, a skeptical visitor could then examine these proofs to verify that it’s an original.

All of these methods are already being used to varying degrees in the effort to vet content online. Microsoft evaluated 60 different combinations of them, modeling how each setup would hold up under different failure scenarios—from metadata being stripped to content being slightly altered or deliberately manipulated. The team then mapped which combinations produce sound results that platforms can confidently show to people online, and which ones are so unreliable that they may cause more confusion than clarification.

The company’s chief scientific officer, Eric Horvitz, says the work was prompted by legislation—like California’s AI Transparency Act, which will take effect in August—and the speed at which AI has developed to combine video and voice with striking fidelity.

“You might call this self-regulation,” Horvitz told MIT Technology Review. But it’s clear he sees pursuing the work as boosting Microsoft’s image: “We’re also trying to be a selected, desired provider to people who want to know what’s going on in the world.”

Nevertheless, Horvitz declined to commit to Microsoft using its own recommendation across its platforms. The company sits at the center of a giant AI content ecosystem: It runs Copilot, which can generate images and text; it operates Azure, the cloud service through which customers can access OpenAI and other major AI models; it owns LinkedIn, one of the world’s largest professional platforms; and it holds a significant stake in OpenAI. But when asked about in-house implementation, Horvitz said in a statement, “Product groups and leaders across the company were involved in this study to inform product road maps and infrastructure, and our engineering teams are taking action on the report’s findings.”

It’s important to note that there are inherent limits to these tools; just as they would not tell you what your Rembrandt means, they are not built to determine if content is accurate or not. They only reveal if it has been manipulated. It’s a point that Horvitz says he has to make to lawmakers and others who are skeptical of Big Tech as an arbiter of fact.

“It’s not about making any decisions about what’s true and not true,” he said. “It’s about coming up with labels that just tell folks where stuff came from.”

Hany Farid, a professor at UC Berkeley who specializes in digital forensics but wasn’t involved in the Microsoft research, says that if the industry adopted the company’s blueprint, it would be meaningfully more difficult to deceive the public with manipulated content. Sophisticated individuals or governments can work to bypass such tools, he says, but the new standard could eliminate a significant portion of misleading material.

“I don’t think it solves the problem, but I think it takes a nice big chunk out of it,” he says.

Still, there are reasons to see Microsoft’s approach as an example of somewhat naïve techno-optimism. There is growing evidence that people are swayed by AI-generated content even when they know that it is false. And in a recent study of pro-Russian AI-generated videos about the war in Ukraine, comments pointing out that the videos were made with AI received far less engagement than comments treating them as genuine.

“Are there people who, no matter what you tell them, are going to believe what they believe?” Farid asks. “Yes.” But, he adds, “there are a vast majority of Americans and citizens around the world who I do think want to know the truth.”

That desire has not exactly led to urgent action from tech companies. Google started adding a watermark to content generated by its AI tools in 2023, which Farid says has been helpful in his investigations. Some platforms use C2PA, a provenance standard Microsoft helped launch in 2021. But the full suite of changes that Microsoft suggests, powerful as they are, might remain only suggestions if they threaten the business models of AI companies or social media platforms.

“If the Mark Zuckerbergs and the Elon Musks of the world think that putting ‘AI generated’ labels on something will reduce engagement, then of course they’re incentivized not to do it,” Farid says. Platforms like Meta and Google have already said they’d include labels for AI-generated content, but an audit conducted by Indicator last year found that only 30% of its test posts on Instagram, LinkedIn, Pinterest, TikTok, and YouTube were correctly labeled as AI-generated.

More forceful moves toward content verification might come from the many pieces of AI regulation pending around the world. The European Union’s AI Act, as well as proposed rules in India and elsewhere, would all compel AI companies to require some form of disclosure that a piece of content was generated with AI.

One priority from Microsoft is, unsurprisingly, to play a role in shaping these rules. The company waged a lobbying effort during the drafting of California’s AI Transparency Act, which Horvitz said made the legislation’s requirements on how tech companies must disclose AI-generated content “a bit more realistic.”

But another is a very real concern about what could happen if the rollout of such content-verification technology is done poorly. Lawmakers are demanding tools that can verify what’s real, but the tools are fragile. If labeling systems are rushed out, inconsistently applied, or frequently wrong, people could come to distrust them altogether, and the entire effort would backfire. That’s why the researchers argue that it may be better in some cases to show nothing at all than a verdict that could be wrong.

Inadequate tools could also create new avenues for what the researchers call sociotechnical attacks. Imagine that someone takes a real image of a fraught political event and uses an AI tool to change only an inconsequential share of pixels in the image. When it spreads online, it could be misleadingly classified by platforms as AI-manipulated. But combining provenance and watermark tools would mean platforms could clarify that the content was only partially AI generated, and point out where the changes were made.

California’s AI Transparency Act will be the first major test of these tools in the US, but enforcement could be challenged by President Trump’s executive order from late last year seeking to curtail state AI regulations that are “burdensome” to the industry. The administration has also generally taken a posture against efforts to curb disinformation, and last year, via DOGE, it canceled grants related to misinformation. And, of course, official government channels in the Trump administration have shared content manipulated with AI (MIT Technology Review reported that the Department of Homeland Security, for example, uses video generators from Google and Adobe to make content it shares with the public).

I asked Horvitz whether fake content from this source worries him as much as that coming from the rest of social media. He initially declined to comment, but then he said, “Governments have not been outside the sectors that have been behind various kinds of manipulative disinformation, and this is worldwide.”

Backlash against ICE is fueling a broader movement against AI companies’ ties to President Trump.

How uncrewed narco subs could transform the Colombian drug trade

For decades, handmade narco subs have been some of the cocaine trade’s most elusive and productive workhorses, ferrying multi-ton loads of illicit drugs from Colombian estuaries toward markets in North America and, increasingly, the rest of the world. Now off-the-shelf technology—Starlink terminals, plug-and-play nautical autopilots, high-resolution video cameras—may be advancing that cat-and-mouse game into a new phase.Uncrewed subs could move more cocaine over longer distances, and they wouldn’t put human smugglers at risk of capture. And law enforcement around the world is just beginning to grapple with what this means for the future. Read the full story.

Google DeepMind wants to know if chatbots are just virtue signaling

The news: Google DeepMind is calling for the moral behavior of large language models—such as what they do when called on to act as companions, therapists, medical advisors, and so on—to be scrutinized with the same kind of rigor as their ability to code or do math.

Why it matters: As LLMs improve, people are asking them to play more and more sensitive roles in their lives. Agents are starting to take actions on people’s behalf. LLMs may be able to influence human decision-making. And yet nobody knows how trustworthy this technology really is at such tasks. Read the full story.

The building legal case for global climate justice

The United States and the European Union grew into economic superpowers by committing climate atrocities. They have burned a wildly disproportionate share of the world’s oil and gas, planting carbon time bombs that will detonate first in the poorest, hottest parts of the globe.Morally, there’s an ironclad case that the countries or companies responsible for this mess should provide compensation. Legally, though, the case has been far harder to make. But now those tides might be turning. Read the full story.

            <p><strong>MIT Technology Review | 2026-02-19</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2026/02/19/1132619/uncrewed-narco-subs-transform-columbian-drug-trade/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">On a bright morning last April, a surveillance plane operated by the Colombian military spotted a 40-foot-long shark-like silhouette idling in the ocean just off Tayrona National Park. It was, unmistakably, a “narco sub,” a stealthy fiberglass vessel that sails with its hull almost entirely underwater, used by drug cartels to move cocaine north. The plane’s crew radioed it in, and eventually nearby coast guard boats got the order, routine but urgent: Intercept.

In Cartagena, about 150 miles from the action, Captain Jaime González Zamudio, commander of the regional coast guard group, sat down at his desk to watch what happened next. On his computer monitor, icons representing his patrol boats raced toward the sub’s coordinates as updates crackled over his radio from the crews at sea. This was all standard; Colombia is the world’s largest producer of cocaine, and its navy has been seizing narco subs for decades. And so the captain was pretty sure what the outcome would be. His crew would catch up to the sub, just a bit of it showing above the water’s surface. They’d bring it to heel, board it, and force open the hatch to find two, three, maybe four exhausted men suffocating in a mix of diesel fumes and humidity, and a cargo compartment holding several tons of cocaine.

The boats caught up to the sub. A crew boarded, forced open the hatch, and confirmed that the vessel was secure. But from that point on, things were different.

First, some unexpected details came over the radio: There was no cocaine on board. Neither was there a crew, nor a helm, nor even enough room for a person to lie down. Instead, inside the hull the crew found a fuel tank, an autopilot system and control electronics, and a remotely monitored security camera. González Zamudio’s crew started sending pictures back to Cartagena: Bolted to the hull was another camera, as well as two plastic rectangles, each about the size of a cookie sheet—antennas for connecting to Starlink satellite internet.

The authorities towed the boat back to Cartagena, where military techs took a closer look. Weeks later, they came to an unsettling conclusion: This was Colombia’s first confirmed uncrewed narco sub. It could be operated by remote control, but it was also capable of some degree of autonomous travel. The techs concluded that the sub was likely a prototype built by the Clan del Golfo, a powerful criminal group that operates along the Caribbean coast.

For decades, handmade narco subs have been some of the cocaine trade’s most elusive and productive workhorses, ferrying multi-ton loads of illicit drugs from Colombian estuaries toward markets in North America and, increasingly, the rest of the world. Now off-the-shelf technology—Starlink terminals, plug-and-play nautical autopilots, high-resolution video cameras—may be advancing that cat-and-mouse game into a new phase.

Uncrewed subs could move more cocaine over longer distances, and they wouldn’t put human smugglers at risk of capture. Law enforcement around the world is just beginning to grapple with what the Tayrona sub means for the future—whether it was merely an isolated experiment or the opening move in a new era of autonomous drug smuggling at sea.

Drug traffickers love the ocean. “You can move drug traffic through legal and illegal routes,” says Juan Pablo Serrano, a captain in the Colombian navy and head of the operational coordination center for Orión, a multiagency, multinational counternarcotics effort. The giant container ships at the heart of global commerce offer a favorite approach, Serrano says. Bribe a chain of dockworkers and inspectors, hide a load in one of thousands of cargo boxes, and put it on a totally legal commercial vessel headed to Europe or North America. That route is slow and expensive—involving months of transit and bribes spread across a wide network—but relatively low risk. “A ship can carry 5,000 containers. Good luck finding the right one,” he says.

Far less legal, but much faster and cheaper, are small, powerful motorboats. Quick to build and cheap to crew, these “go-fasts” top out at just under 50 feet long and can move smaller loads in hours rather than days. But they’re also easy for coastal radars and patrols to spot.

Submersibles—or, more accurately, “semisubmersibles”—fit somewhere in the middle. They take more money and engineering to build than an open speedboat, but they buy stealth—even if a bit of the vessel rides at the surface, the bulk stays hidden underwater. That adds another option to a portfolio that smugglers constantly rebalance across three variables: risk, time, and cost. When US and Colombian authorities tightened control over air routes and commercial shipping in the early 1990s, subs became more attractive. The first ones were crude wooden hulls with a fiberglass shell and extra fuel tanks, cobbled together in mangrove estuaries, hidden from prying eyes. Today’s fiberglass semisubmersible designs ride mostly below the surface, relying on diesel engines that can push multi-ton loads for days at a time while presenting little more than a ripple and a hot exhaust pipe to radar and infrared sensors.

A typical semisubmersible costs under $2 million to build and can carry three metric tons of cocaine. That’s worth over $160 million in Europe—wholesale.

Most ferry between South American coasts and handoff points in Central America and Mexico, where allied criminal organizations break up the cargo and slowly funnel it toward the US. But some now go much farther. In 2019, Spanish authorities intercepted a semisubmersible after a 27-day transatlantic voyage from Brazil. In 2024, police in the Solomon Islands found the first narco sub in the Asia-Pacific region, a semisubmersible probably originating from Colombia on its way to Australia or New Zealand.

If the variables are risk, time, and cost, then the economics of a narco sub are simple. Even if they spend more time on the water than a powerboat, they’re less likely to get caught—and a relative bargain to produce. A narco sub might cost between $1 million and $2 million to build, but a kilo of cocaine costs just about $500 to make. “By the time that kilo reaches Europe, it can sell for between $44,000 and $55,000,” Serrano says. A typical semisubmersible carries up to three metric tons—cargo worth well over $160 million at European wholesale prices.

Off-the-shelf nautical autopilots, WiFi antennas, Starlink satellite internet connections, and remote cameras are all drug smugglers need to turn semisubmersibles into drone ships.

As a result, narco subs are getting more common. Seizures by authorities tripled in the last 20 years, according to Colombia’s International Center for Research and Analysis Against Maritime Drug Trafficking (CMCON), and Serrano admits that the Orión alliance has enough ships and aircraft to catch only a fraction of what sails.

Until now, though, narco subs have had one major flaw: They depended on people, usually poor fishermen or low-level recruits sealed into stifling compartments for days at a time, steering by GPS and sight, hoping not to be spotted. That made the subs expensive and a risk to drug sellers if captured. Like good capitalists, the Tayrona boat’s builders seem to have been trying to obviate labor costs with automation. No crew means more room for drugs or fuel and no sailors to pay—or to get arrested or flip if a mission goes wrong.

“If you don’t have a person or people on board, that makes the transoceanic routes much more feasible,” says Henry Shuldiner, a researcher at InSight Crime who has analyzed hundreds of narco-sub cases. It’s one thing, he notes, to persuade someone to spend a day or two going from Colombia to Panama for a big payout; it’s another to ask four people to spend three weeks sealed inside a cramped tube, sleeping, eating, and relieving themselves in the same space. “That’s a hard sell,” Shuldiner says.

An uncrewed sub doesn’t have to race to a rendezvous because its crew can endure only a few days inside. It can move more slowly and stealthily. It can wait out patrols or bad weather, loiter near a meeting point, or take longer and less well-monitored routes. And if something goes wrong—if a military plane appears or navigation fails—its owners can simply scuttle the vessel from afar.

Meanwhile, the basic technology to make all that work is getting more and more affordable, and the potential profit margins are rising. “The rapidly approaching universality of autonomous technology could be a nightmare for the U.S. Coast Guard,” wrote two Coast Guard officers in the US Naval Institute’s journal Proceedings in 2021. And as if to prove how good an idea drone narco subs are, the US Marine Corps and the weapons builder Leidos are testing a low-profile uncrewed vessel called the Sea Specter, which they describe as being “inspired” by narco-sub design.

The possibility that drug smugglers are experimenting with autonomous subs isn’t just theoretical. Law enforcement agencies on other smuggling routes have found signs the Tayrona sub isn’t an isolated case. In 2022, Spanish police seized three small submersible drones near Cádiz, on Spain’s southern coast. Two years later, Italian authorities confiscated a remote-­controlled minisubmarine they believed was intended for drug runs. “The probability of expansion is high,” says Diego Cánovas, a port and maritime security expert in Spain. Tayrona, the biggest and most technologically advanced uncrewed narco sub found so far, is more likely a preview than an anomaly.

Today, the Tayrona semisubmersible sits on a strip of grass at the ARC Bolívar naval base in Cartagena. It’s exposed to the elements; rain has streaked its paint. To one side lies an older, bulkier narco sub seized a decade ago, a blue cylinder with a clumsy profile. The Tayrona’s hull looks lower, leaner, and more refined.

Up close, it is also unmistakably handmade. The hull is a dull gray-blue, the fiberglass rough in places, with scrapes and dents from the tow that brought it into port. It has no identifying marks on the exterior—nothing that would tie it to a country, a company, or a port. On the upper surface sit the two Starlink antennas, painted over in the same gray-blue to keep them from standing out against the sea.

I climb up a ladder and drop through the small hatch near the stern. Inside, the air is damp and close, the walls beaded with condensation. Small puddles of fuel have collected in the bilge. The vessel has no seating, no helm or steering wheel, and not enough space to stand up straight or lie down. It’s clear it was never meant to carry people. A technical report by CMCON found that the sub would have enough fuel for a journey of some 800 nautical miles, and the central cargo bay would hold between 1 and 1.5 tons of cocaine.

At the aft end, the machinery compartment is a tangle of hardware: diesel engine, batteries, pumps, and a chaotic bundle of cables feeding an electronics rack. All the core components are still there. Inside that rack, investigators identified a NAC-3 autopilot processor, a commercial unit designed to steer midsize boats by tying into standard hydraulic pumps, heading sensors, and rudder-­feedback systems. They cost about $2,200 on Amazon.

“These are plug-and-play technologies,” says Wilmar Martínez, a mechatronics professor at the University of America in Bogotá, when I show him pictures of the inside of the sub. “Midcareer mechatronics students could install them.”

For all its advantages, an autonomous drug-smuggling submarine wouldn’t be invincible. Even without a crew on board, there are still people in the chain. Every satellite internet terminal—Starlink or not—comes with a billing address, a payment method, and a log of where and when it pings the constellation. Colombian officers have begun to talk about negotiating formal agreements with providers, asking them to alert authorities when a transceiver’s movements match known smuggling patterns. Brazil’s government has already cut a deal with Starlink to curb criminal use of its service in the Amazon.

The basic playbook for finding a drone sub will look much like the one for crewed semisubmersibles. Aircraft and ships will use radar to pick out small anomalies and infrared cameras to look for the heat of a diesel engine or the turbulence of a wake. That said, it might not work. “If they wind up being smaller, they’re going to be darn near impossible to detect,” says Michael Knickerbocker, a former US Navy officer who advises defense tech firms.

Autonomous drug subs are “a great example of how resilient cocaine traffickers are, and how they’re continuously one step ahead of authorities,” says one researcher.

Even worse, navies already act on only a fraction of their intelligence leads because they don’t have enough ships and aircraft. The answer, Knickerbocker argues, is “robot on robot.” Navies and coast guards will need swarms of their own small, relatively cheap uncrewed systems—surface vessels, underwater gliders, and long-endurance aerial vehicles that can loiter, sense, and relay data back to human operators. Those experiments have already begun. The US 4th Fleet, which covers Latin America and the Caribbean, is experimenting with uncrewed platforms in counternarcotics patrols. Across the Atlantic, the European Union’s European Maritime Safety Agency operates drones for maritime surveillance.

Today, though, the major screens against oceangoing vessels of all kinds are coastal radar networks. Spain operates SIVE to watch over choke points like the Strait of Gibraltar, and in the Pacific, Australia’s over-the-horizon radar network, JORN, can spot objects hundreds of miles away, far beyond the range of conventional radar.

Even so, it’s not enough to just spot an uncrewed narco sub. Law enforcement also has to stop it—and that will be tricky.

With a crewed vessel, Colombian doctrine says coast guard units should try to hail the boat first with lights, sirens, radio calls, and warning shots. If that fails, interceptor crews sometimes have to jump aboard and force the hatch. Officers worry that future autonomous craft could be wired to sink or even explode if someone gets too close. “If they get destroyed, we may lose the evidence,” says Víctor González Badrán, a navy captain and director of CMCON. “That means no seizure and no legal proceedings against that organization.”

That’s where electronic warfare enters the picture—radio-frequency jamming, cyber tools, perhaps more exotic options. In the simplest version, jamming means flooding the receiver with noise so that commands from the operator never reach the vessel. Spoofing goes a step further, feeding fake signals so that the sub thinks it’s somewhere else or obediently follows a fake set of waypoints. Cyber tools might aim higher up the chain, trying to penetrate the software that runs the vessel or the networks it uses to talk to satellite constellations. At the cutting edge of these countermeasures are electromagnetic pulses designed to fry electronics outright, turning a million-dollar narco sub into a dead hull drifting at sea.

In reality, the tools that might catch a future Tayrona sub are unevenly distributed, politically sensitive, and often experimental. Powerful cyber or electromagnetic tricks are closely guarded secrets; using them in a drug case risks exposing capabilities that militaries would rather reserve for wars. Systems like Australia’s JORN radar are tightly held national security assets, their exact performance specs classified, and sharing raw data with countries on the front lines of the cocaine trade would inevitably mean revealing hints as to how they got it. “Just because a capability exists doesn’t mean you employ it,” Knickerbocker says.

Analysts don’t think uncrewed narco subs will reshape the global drug trade, despite the technological leap. Trafficking organizations will still hedge their bets across those three variables, hiding cocaine in shipping containers, dissolving it into liquids and paints, racing it north in fast boats. “I don’t think this is revolutionary,” Shuldiner says. “But it’s a great example of how resilient cocaine traffickers are, and how they’re continuously one step ahead of authorities.”

There’s still that chance, though, that everything international law enforcement agencies know about drug smuggling is about to change. González Zamudio says he keeps getting requests from foreign navies, coast guards, and security agencies to come see the Tayrona sub. He greets their delegations, takes them out to the strip of grass on the base, and walks them around it, gives them tours. It has become a kind of pilgrimage. Everyone who makes it worries that the next time a narco sub appears near a distant coastline, they’ll board it as usual, force the hatch—and find it full of cocaine and gadgets, but without a single human occupant. And no one knows what happens after that.

            <h2>The building legal case for global climate justice</h2>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The United States and the European Union grew into economic superpowers by committing climate atrocities. They have burned a wildly disproportionate share of the world’s oil and gas, planting carbon time bombs that will detonate first in the poorest, hottest parts of the globe.

Meanwhile, places like the Solomon Islands and Chad—low-lying or just plain sweltering—have emitted relatively little carbon dioxide, but by dint of their latitude and history, they rank among the countries most vulnerable to the fiercest consequences of global warming. That means increasingly devastating cyclones, heat waves, famines, and floods.

Morally, there’s an ironclad case that the countries or companies responsible for this mess should provide compensation for the homes that will be destroyed, the shorelines that will disappear beneath rising seas, and the lives that will be cut short. By one estimate, the major economies owe a climate debt to the rest of the world approaching $200 trillion in reparations.

Legally, though, the case has been far harder to make. Even putting aside the jurisdictional problems, early climate science couldn’t trace the provenance of airborne molecules of carbon dioxide across oceans and years. Deep-pocketed corporations with top-tier legal teams easily exploited those difficulties.

Now those tides might be turning. More climate-related lawsuits are getting filed, particularly in the Global South. Governments, nonprofits, and citizens in the most climate-exposed nations continue to test new legal arguments in new courts, and some of those courts are showing a new willingness to put nations and their industries on the hook as a matter of human rights. In addition, the science of figuring out exactly who is to blame for specific weather disasters, and to what degree, is getting better and better.

It’s true that no court has yet held any climate emitter liable for climate-related damages. For starters, nations are generally immune from lawsuits originating in other countries. That’s why most cases have focused on major carbon producers. But they’ve leaned on a pretty powerful defense.

While oil and gas companies extract, refine, and sell the world’s fossil fuels, most of the emissions come out of “the vehicles, power plants, and factories that burn the fuel,” as Michael Gerrard and Jessica Wentz, of Columbia Law School’s Sabin Center, note in a recent piece in Nature. In other words, companies just dig the stuff up. It’s not their fault someone else sets it on fire.

So victims of extreme weather events continue to try new legal avenues and approaches, backed by ever-more-convincing science. Plaintiffs in the Philippines recently sued the oil giant Shell over its role in driving Super Typhoon Odette, a 2021 storm that killed more than 400 people and displaced nearly 800,000. The case relies partially on an attribution study that found climate change made extreme rainfall like that seen in Odette twice as likely.

Overall, evidence of corporate culpability—linking a specific company’s fossil fuel to a specific disaster—is getting easier to find. For example, a study published in Nature in September was able to determine how much particular companies contributed to a series of 21st-century heat waves.

A number of recent legal decisions signal improving odds for these kinds of suits. Notably, a handful of determinations in climate cases before the European Court of Human Rights affirmed that states have legal obligations to protect people from the effects of climate change. And though it dismissed the case of a Peruvian farmer who sued a German power company over fears that a melting alpine glacier could destroy his property, a German court determined that major carbon polluters could in principle be found liable for climate damages tied to their emissions.

At least one lawsuit has already emerged that could test that principle: Dozens of Pakistani farmers whose land was deluged during the massive flooding events of 2022 have sued a pair of major German power and cement companies.

Even if the lawsuit fails, that would be a problem with the system, not the science. Major carbon-polluting countries and companies have a disproportionate responsibility for climate-change-powered disasters.

Wealthy nations continued to encourage business practices that pollute the atmosphere, even as the threat of climate change grew increasingly grave. And oil and gas companies remain the kingpin suppliers to a fossil-fuel-addicted world. They have operated with the full knowledge of the massive social, environmental, and human cost imposed by their business while lobbying fiercely against any rules that would force them to pay for those harms or clean up their act.

They did it. They knew. In a civil society where rule of law matters, they should pay the price.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Google’s announcement that its Gemini app now writes music for you isn’t just one of those “blowing my mind” product updates. It feels like a symbolic surrender to a long-standing refrain from Big Tech: creative work is now just another checkbox for a machine.

If you don’t know what I am talking about, yesterday Google launched a new feature, Lyria 3, in the Gemini app, that allows us to cook up 30-second tracks complete with lyrics and cover art from a text prompt or a photo, of course, generated by Nano Banana; basically, no instruments, no experience, no pesky tactile skill required.

It’s essentially a LEGO set for “songs” that lasts about as long as a TikTok loop. They say it’s designed for YouTube Creators, and I tend to agree with them, because you can’t make to much with 30 seconds.

Still, the underlying problem is another one, as I am seeing different projects/songs made with AI, including AI artists. And this is what I want to highlight in this piece.

“Behind every beautiful thing, there’s some kind of pain, “ said Bob Dylan, and I could not agree more.

If we take a look at the history ( art, music, literature, poetry, and so on), the main fuel for creation was indeed pain.

Now, how should I put this? Probably the only pain that Lyria can feel is more like a faint server-overload alert than heartbreak.

Real songwriters know that soul isn’t born in a 30-second prompt, it’s extracted through years of mistakes, late nights, losses, and tiny revelations.

Call it a toy if you like. Google will, too.

They even watermark the outputs with a SynthID tag so the 30-second ditties are officially AI-generated, not “inspired.” That’s a nod to copyright concerns, but it also reads like an admission: these aren’t really art, they’re chemical by-products of pattern statistics.

What’s striking isn’t the novelty. Much of this has been possible in labs and APIs for years, and creators have been experimenting with generative music tools as collaborators.

What Lyria 3 does, and what makes this moment worth watching, is normalising the idea that anyone can “write” a song with a chatbot and a mood descriptor. That’s not empowerment; it’s a devaluation of craft.

Just because you pay a subscription to Suno, that’s another AI music generator, and that one is more complex, that doesn’t make you an artist or a singer. Just because you learn how to write a prompt for any LLM model and generates you pages, you are not a writer.

Imagine a world where every blog has AI-generated copy, not that we are not almost in the middle of this, and every company can churn out half-baked music for their ads or social posts.

In that economy, a professional songwriter’s unique skill becomes as optional as knowing how to use a metronome.

You could ask Gemini for an “emotional indie ballad about a lost sock,” and voilà, you have something. Whether it has actual coherence or soul is left to the listener to decide. It is fun to use it with your friends, shorts, to impress your date.

Video: Gemini Lyria Music Generation Feature – Socks, uploaded by Google on YouTube

Still, Lyria 3’s music is capped at 30 seconds, and that’s no accident. It sidesteps deeper legal and ethical quarrels about training data and mimicry of existing works by keeping outputs short and legally fuzzy. That’s a thumbs up from me.

But even within that limit, it’s now possible for someone with no craft or cultural context to generate riffs, lyrics, and chord progressions that sound, to the casual ear, adequately musical. In an attention economy obsessed with shareability, “adequate” quickly becomes plenty.

This matters because real songs, the ones that endure, that carry human experience, aren’t just collections of musical atoms. They’re shaped by story, risk, cultural memory, and sometimes contradiction.

One of my favorite artists, Tom Waits, said, ”I don’t have a formal background. I learned from listening to records, from talking to people, from hanging around record stores, and hanging around musicians and saying, “Hey, how did you do that? Do that again. Let me see how you did that.”

This was the research and prompting before, and it’s not only about reducing time, or getting things faster, and “having more time for you.”

It’s about the entire process, the contact with other artists, humans, and IDEAS.

Those are qualities machines can mimic but not originate. When the machines own the first pass at creation, and the commercial ecosystem embraces that output because it is cheap and fast, the incentives shift. Not gradually. Suddenly.

The record industry is already grappling with AI. Streaming services, publishers, and even labels have begun experimenting with algorithmic playlists and automated composition.

What Gemini’s Lyria 3 does is extend that experiment to public perception. A whole generation may come to think that “making music” means typing a description and choosing a style. Songwriting becomes a UX problem, not a craft one.

That raises a serious question: in a world where AI can conjure up a half-decent hook on demand, what will distinguish professional artists?

If the answer is only brand story or marketing muscle, we aren’t celebrating creativity; we are monetising it out of existence.

Tech companies like Google will frame this as liberation. And in a literal sense, anyone who’s ever wanted to hear a short tune about a sock’s existential crisis now can. But liberation without value for the creator is just consumerism by another name.

Lyria 3 might be good for GIF soundtracks and social clips, and TikTok viral reels, but it doesn’t make professional musicians obsolete; it makes their work less necessary to the platforms that reward hyper-consumable content.

That’s a different threat from outright replacement: it’s obsolescence by trivialisation.

If AI is going to be part of musical creation, then let it be as an assistant to the composer,  someone who improves ideas, not replaces them. What we’re seeing with Gemini is not collaboration but outsourcing.

And the lesson for artists isn’t to fear the algorithm. It’s to insist on clarity about where AI replaces labour and where it augments human sensibility.

Because once the marketplace equates the two, the humans who do the work will be the ones left asking for royalties in a language no one else wants to speak.

And, as a personal recommendation, not sponsored, there are streaming platforms like Deezer that have built AI detection tools that flag and label AI-generated tracks, excluding them from recommendations and royalties so that human songwriters aren’t buried under synthetic spam, and consumers can make the difference between AI and human.

If you care about preserving real artistry in a world of text-to-tune generative models, start paying attention to how platforms handle AI-tagging and choose services that give you transparency about what you’re actually listening to.

Yet, I’m not here to throw shade at Lyria 3; if anything, the idea of letting people turn a photo or a mood into a short track sounds like fun for casual use and creative experimentation. It is what Google says it’s meant for.

Yet the reality is that as these models proliferate, we risk confusing novelty with art. And here, the big tech companies are not the ones to blame, but us.

            <div id="article-text">Plato, a Berlin-based startup, has raised $14.5 million in seed funding to bring generative AI into wholesale distribution, a massive industry that rarely makes tech headlines but quietly moves a significant share of the world’s goods.

The round was led by Atomico, with Cherry Ventures, Discovery Ventures, and D11Z joining in.

Wholesale distribution accounts for roughly one-fifth of global production flows. Yet much of it still runs on aging ERP systems, Excel spreadsheets, and manual quoting workflows that haven’t meaningfully evolved in years.

While AI has flooded marketing, customer support, and coding, distribution sales teams are often still copy-pasting numbers between systems.

A workspace designed for growth, collaboration, and endless networking opportunities in the heart of tech.

Plato’s thesis is simple: instead of adding another dashboard, embed AI directly into the operational core. The company connects to existing ERP systems and turns historical sales data into automated actions, flagging revenue opportunities, generating quotes, and identifying risks before they surface in quarterly reports.

The idea grew out of lived frustration. Co-founder Benedikt Nolte experienced the inefficiencies firsthand in his family’s distribution business. Generic CRM tools, he concluded, weren’t designed for the complexity of distributor operations. Plato was built specifically for that environment, not retrofitted from SaaS templates designed for startups.

Early traction suggests the industry is paying attention. Plato reportedly works with several large distributors on six-figure contracts, a sign that AI adoption in traditional sectors is less about hype and more about whether it can save time and unlock revenue.

The fresh capital will help Plato expand beyond sales intelligence into areas like procurement and customer service automation, while pushing into new European markets and eventually the U.S.

More broadly, the round highlights a shift in AI investing. The next wave isn’t just about bigger language models; it’s about embedding intelligence into industries that haven’t been rewritten by software yet. Wholesale distribution may not be glamorous, but it is structurally essential. If AI can modernize that layer of the economy, the impact will be far larger than another chatbot demo.

If the fundraising will be completed, would be the largest seed round ever seen in Europe.

The round is being led by Sequoia Capital, with titans such as Nvidia, Google and Microsoft reportedly in talks to participate, according to industry sources familiar with the deal.

The proposed investment would place Ineffable Intelligence’s pre-money valuation at around $4 billion, an eye-watering figure for a company that hasn’t yet shipped a product.

David Silver’s name is synonymous with some of the most memorable milestones in AI. During more than a decade at Google DeepMind, he helped develop AlphaGo, the first AI to defeat a world champion at the ancient game of Go, and later AlphaStar, which bested professional players in StarCraft II.

His work has shaped how modern AI systems learn and make decisions.

In late 2025, David Silver left DeepMind, where he also contributed to the development of the Gemini family of large language models, to launch Ineffable Intelligence. .

In the current days billion-dollar seed rounds are no longer unheard of, but they remain exceptionally rare, especially in Europe.

If Sequoia and its partners follow through on their commitments, the round would serve as both a vote of confidence in David Silver’s vision and a broader signal that venture capitalists are increasingly willing to fund ambitious, research-driven AI ventures well before traditional product milestone

The sheer size of the potential round also reshapes the narrative around Europe’s role in the global AI race.

Historically, most of the industry’s capital and rich technical talent have gravitated to Silicon Valley and other U.S. hubs. A £737 million-plus round led by a top U.S. investor shows that world-class AI ideas can still attract world-class capital in Europe.

David Silver’s dual role – as an entrepreneur and as a professor at University College London,  hints at a blend of academic ambition and commercial pressure that may define the next era of AI innovation.

His thesis suggests that the path to genuinely powerful AI may not be simply scaling up models, but teaching systems to learn and improve through real-world experience, a direction he believes could outpace approaches grounded solely in data accumulated from human interactions.

Whether Ineffable Intelligence ultimately delivers on its lofty vision remains to be seen.

But the enthusiasm around its fundraising reflects a broader trend: AI is entering a phase where conviction in founders and ideas can translate directly into unprecedented capital flows.

For Europe, a successful $1 billion cap table would be a milestone moment, not just financially, but symbolically,  in positioning the continent as a contender for the future of AI research and deployment.

            <div id="article-text">If you tuned in to China’s 2026 CCTV Spring Festival Gala looking for traditional lion dances and nostalgic tunes, you may have done a double-take when what greeted you was a squad of humanoid robots performing kung fu, synchronized moves, and comedy sketches with more precision than most of us manage during family reunions.

It was not just spectacle; it was industrial policy with flair

This year’s gala, which is China’s equivalent of the Super Bowl meets cultural heritage broadcast, featured everything from high-speed martial arts sequences to choreographed routines done by humanoid robots from leading local makers like Unitree Robotics, Galbot, MagicLab and Noetix.

Watching them flip, strike poses, and dance isn’t just futuristic entertainment; it’s a deliberate signal about where Chinese tech wants to sit at the global table.

Just last year, robot appearances were charming but clunky: think awkward “dances” that needed human help to keep upright.

The latest rumblings from the EU tech scene, a story from our wise ol&#39; founder Boris, and some questionable AI art. It&#39;s free, every week, in your inbox. Sign up now!

Instead, this year, they executed complex actions; backflips, martial arts inspired routines, even comedic timing that was surprisingly sharp for machines. C

lips of the robots went viral almost immediately, flooding social platforms and dominating international tech feeds.

Chinese state media and commentators have leaned into the moment as proof of rapid progress in humanoid robotics, placing it squarely within China’s “AI+manufacturing” industrial ambitions.

While some viewers showered praise on the displays, others grumbled that the new lineup made the gala feel more like CES Lite than a cosy celebration of culture, and yes, robots “stealing the Year of the Horse thunder” is now a real complaint.

The optics are unmistakable. China’s robotics sector, already responsible for a lion’s share of worldwide humanoid robot production, is eager to tell a simple story: we don’t just build hardware in factories, we animate it with AI brainsthat can perform with finesse.

Whether it’s a crowd-pleasing kung fu sequence or a scripted comedy routine, these robots have become ambassadors of technological prowess on very prime cultural real estate.

But let’s not overstate their practical chops just yet. Despite impressive stage routines, robotics experts point out that most current humanoids are still best at pre-programmed movements and lack true autonomous adaptability in unpredictable environments.

In other words, they’re amazing performers on cue, not yet ready to be your personal caregiver or industrial line worker without a lot more training and development.

Still, the spectacle accomplishes something important: it thrusts humanoid robots into the public imagination while signalling to investors, startups and rival nations that robot development is now prime time tech theatre, not just a research lab curiosity.

Whether you see this as a fun blend of culture and innovation or a high-stakes display of national tech strategy, China’s robotics presence at the gala is now part of a broader conversation about where AI embodied in hardware might go next.

It’s less about whether robots will “replace us” and more about how they’re being introduced into narratives that billions of people watch together, shaping perceptions and expectations about the future.

China’s robots danced their way into billions of screens this Lunar New Year, and they did it with style, precision, and a well-timed cultural wink.

            <a class="original-link" href="https://thenextweb.com/news/vc-quantonation-closes-e220m-fund-to-back-next-gen-physics-tech">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">A Paris-based venture firm that has quietly shaped the quantum technology scenery is now making a much louder statement about Europe’s role in the future of computing, materials science, and sensing.

Quantonation Ventures has today announced the successful close of its second flagship fund at €220 million, more than double the size of its first vehicle and a clear signal that institutional capital is flowing into technologies grounded in physics, not just software.

Quantonation is not your typical venture capital firm. From its inception, it set out to invest in startups building real hardware and disruptive physics-based platforms, including quantum computing, sensing, communications, advanced materials, and what the industry calls “deep physics.”

The new Quantonation II fund attracted big names in institutional capital alongside strategic technology investors. Backers include the European Investment Fund, French public investor Bpifrance, Spanish construction and infrastructure group Grupo ACS, Denmark’s Novo Holdings, Japanese tech giant Toshiba, and Singapore-linked Vertex Holdings among others.

This mix of public and private capital reflects broader confidence in the potential of physics-based technologies to move beyond the research lab and into tangible commercial impact.

Where early quantum investing often centered on proof-of-concept breakthroughs, Quantonation’s strategy now emphasizes industrialization, scale, and products that customers, not just scientists, can use.

Quantonation’s expanded fund will target roughly 25 companies, writing larger checks and backing startups through earlier stages and scaling phases alike.

The portfolio already spans quantum computing hardware, advanced materials, sensing systems, and even components aimed at preparing infrastructure for widespread quantum deployment. Investments so far include:

This spread illustrates both a depth and a breadth of conviction: rather than betting on a single application, the fund’s investors are backing an ecosystem of physics-driven companies that could redefine multiple industries.

Despite this progress, Europe still trails the U.S. and China in private investment scale for quantum technologies, where large funding pools have helped local startups rapidly expand and commercialize.

The quantum revolution often gets discussed in terms of qubits and breakthrough physics. But investors and industry leaders increasingly see the future as one where quantum systems must integrate into real infrastructure, real supply chains, and real commercial stacks.

With €220 million under management, Quantonation is now one of the largest dedicated funds in its niche, a distinction that positions Europe more firmly in the global competition over next-generation computing and sensing.

What was once a cluster of scattered bets on niche technology now looks like a coherent wave of strategic investment. Europe isn’t just funding quantum anymore; it’s building a commercial ecosystem that might one day compete at scale with global rivals.

            <h2>Mistral AI buys cloud startup Koyeb</h2>
            <p><strong>The Next Web | 2026-02-17</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://thenextweb.com/news/mistral-ai-buys-cloud-startup-koyeb">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">When European tech observers talk about AI ambition, the narrative often splits neatly in two: models and infrastructure. On one side are the clever bits of code that can write, reason, and generate text or images.

On the other is the gritty reality of making those bits run reliably, at scale, and in production. Today, Mistral AI made a move that bridges that divide.

The Paris-based AI upstart confirmed its first acquisition by agreeing to buy Koyeb, another French venture focused on serverless cloud infrastructure for AI workloads. The deal, terms were not disclosed, marks a clear signal: Mistral wants to own not just cutting-edge AI models, but also the infrastructure that delivers them to developers and enterprises.

Mistral has built momentum over the past two years with large language models that have put it in close competition with U.S. players. But for all the excitement around models, real-world adoption hinges on how those models are deployed and scaled.

Koyeb’s technology is built for exactly that: a serverless platform that lets developers run AI apps without managing the underlying infrastructure.

Think of it as giving Mistral not only the engine but also the transmission, the parts that take raw computational power and make it usable on demand. That’s a critical piece when companies want to ship AI solutions without hiring a team of DevOps experts.

This acquisition dovetails with a wider strategy playing out in Europe: build an AI stack that doesn’t depend on U.S. hyperscalers.

Mistral recently announced a €1.2 billion investment in data centers in Sweden and has been vocal about offering a homegrown alternative to cloud services from AWS, Microsoft, and Google.

By folding Koyeb’s team and platform into what they call Mistral Compute, the company is laying claim to a more complex AI offering – from model training to deployment and inference. In other words, it’s less about selling APIs and more about owning the full AI experience.

Koyeb’s roots are in serverless computing, scalable, managed infrastructure that lets developers forget about servers and focus on code. Its platform supports AI tasks across CPUs, GPUs, and specialized accelerators, with features like autoscaling and isolated environments for complex applications.

The founders and all 13 team members are joining Mistral’s engineering ranks, where they’ll shift focus toward embedding their technology into the Mistral Compute platform. For existing users of Koyeb’s services, the transition is designed to be smooth, with the platform continuing to operate as usual while integrating deeper over time.

In a market still heavily dominated by U.S. cloud providers, owning more of the AI value chain is both a business move and a geopolitical statement. This deal isn’t just about snapping up a smaller startup; it’s about signalling a shift in how European AI companies conceive of competition and capability.

One of the early questions about the future of AI wasn’t whether Europe could produce models that compete with those from Silicon Valley, it was whether it could build the platforms and systems those models truly depend on. With the Koyeb acquisition, Mistral is making a direct answer to that question.
