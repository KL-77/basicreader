            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Enforcement against polluters in the United States plunged in the first year of President Donald Trump’s second term, a far bigger drop than in the same period of his first term, according to a new report from a watchdog group.

By analyzing a range of federal court and administrative data, the nonprofit Environmental Integrity Project found that civil lawsuits filed by the US Department of Justice in cases referred by the Environmental Protection Agency dropped to just 16 in the first 12 months after Trump’s inauguration on Jan. 20, 2025. That is 76 percent less than in the first year of the Biden administration.

Trump’s first administration filed 86 such cases in its first year, which was in turn a drop from the Obama administration’s 127 four years earlier.

“Our nation’s landmark environmental laws are meaningless when EPA does not enforce the rules,” Jen Duggan, executive director of the Environmental Integrity Project, said in a statement.

The findings echo two recent analyses from the nonprofits Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility and Earthjustice, which both documented dwindling environmental enforcement under Trump.

From day one of Trump’s second term, the administration has pursued an aggressive deregulatory agenda, scaling back regulations and health safeguards across the federal government that protect water, air and other parts of the environment. This push to streamline industry activities has been particularly favorable for fossil fuel companies. Trump declared an “energy emergency” immediately after his inauguration.

At the EPA, Administrator Lee Zeldin launched in March what the administration called the “biggest deregulatory action in U.S. history”: 31 separate efforts to roll back restrictions on air and water pollution; to hand over more authority to states, some of which have a long history of supporting lax enforcement; and to relinquish EPA’s mandate to act on climate change under the Clean Air Act.

The new report suggests the agency is also relaxing enforcement of existing law. Neither the White House nor the EPA responded to a request for comment.

Part of the decline in lawsuits against polluters could be due to the lack of staff to carry them out, experts say. According to an analysis from E&E News, at least a third of lawyers in the Justice Department’s environment division have left in the past year. Meanwhile, the EPA in 2025 laid off hundreds of employees who monitored pollution that could hurt human health.

Top agency officials are also directing staff to issue fewer violation notices and reduce other enforcement actions. In December, the EPA formalized a new “compliance first” enforcement policy that stresses working with suspected violators to correct problems before launching any formal action that could lead to fines or mandatory correction measures.

“Formal enforcement … is appropriate only when compliance assurance or informal enforcement is inapplicable or insufficient to achieve rapid compliance,” wrote Craig Pritzlaff, who is now a principal deputy assistant EPA administrator, in a Dec. 5 memo to all enforcement officials and regional offices.

Only in rare cases involving an immediate hazard should enforcers use traditional case tools, Pritzlaff said. “Immediate formal enforcement may be required in certain circumstances, such as when there is an emergency that presents significant harm to human health and the environment,” he wrote.

Federal agencies like the EPA, with staffs far outmatched in size compared to the vast sectors of the economy they oversee, typically have used enforcement actions not only to deal with violators but to deter other companies from breaking the law. Environmental advocates worry that without environmental cops visible on the beat, compliance will erode.

Pritzlaff joined the EPA last fall after five years heading up enforcement for the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality, where nonprofit watchdog group Public Citizen noted that he was known as a “reluctant regulator.” Public Citizen and other advocacy groups criticized TCEQ under Pritzlaff’s leadership for its reticence to take decisive action against repeat violators.

One example: An INEOS chemical plant had racked up close to 100 violations over a decade before a 2023 explosion that sent one worker to the hospital, temporarily shut down the Houston Ship Channel and sparked a fire that burned for an hour. Public Citizen said it was told by TCEQ officials that the agency allowed violations to accumulate over the years, arguing it was more efficient to handle multiple issues in a single enforcement action.

“But that proved to be untrue, instead creating a complex backlog of cases that the agency is still struggling to resolve,” Public Citizen wrote last fall after Pritzlaff joined the EPA. “That’s not efficiency, it’s failure.”

Early last year, TCEQ fined INEOS $2.3 million for an extensive list of violations that occurred between 2016 and 2021.

The EPA doesn’t always take entities to court when they violate environmental laws. At times, the agency can resolve these issues through less-formal administrative cases, which actually increased during the first eight months of Trump’s second term when compared to the same period in the Biden administration, according to the new report.

However, most of these administrative actions involved violations of requirements for risk management plans under the Clean Air Act or municipalities’ violations of the Safe Drinking Water Act. The Trump administration did not increase administrative cases that involve pollution from industrial operations, Environmental Integrity Project spokesperson Tom Pelton said over email.

Another signal of declining enforcement: Through September of last year, the EPA issued $41 million in penalties—$8 million less than the same period in the first year of the Biden administration, after adjusting for inflation. This suggests “the Trump Administration may be letting more polluters get by with a slap on the wrist when the Administration does take enforcement action,” the report reads.

Combined, the lack of lawsuits, penalties, and other enforcement actions for environmental violations could impact communities across the country, said Erika Kranz, a senior staff attorney in the Environmental and Energy Law Program at Harvard Law School, who was not involved in the report.

“We’ve been seeing the administration deregulate by repealing rules and extending compliance deadlines, and this decline in enforcement action seems like yet another mechanism that the administration is using to de-emphasize environmental and public health protections,” Kranz said. “It all appears to be connected, and if you’re a person in the US who is worried about your health and the health of your neighbors generally, this certainly could have effects.”

The report notes that many court cases last longer than a year, so it will take time to get a clearer sense of how environmental enforcement is changing under the Trump administration. However, the early data compiled by the Environmental Integrity Project and other nonprofits shows a clear and steep shift away from legal actions against polluters.

Historically, administrations have a “lot of leeway on making enforcement decisions,” Kranz said. But this stark of a drop could prompt lawsuits against the Trump administration, she added.

“Given these big changes and trends, you might see groups arguing that this is more than just an exercise of discretion or choosing priorities [and] this is more of an abdication of an agency’s core mission and its statutory duties,” Kranz said. “I think it’s going to be interesting to see if groups make those arguments, and if they do, how courts look at them.”

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Amid a push toward AI agents, with both Anthropic and OpenAI shipping multi-agent tools this week, Anthropic is more than ready to show off some of its more daring AI coding experiments. But as usual with claims of AI-related achievement, you’ll find some key caveats ahead.

On Thursday, Anthropic researcher Nicholas Carlini published a blog post describing how he set 16 instances of the company’s Claude Opus 4.6 AI model loose on a shared codebase with minimal supervision, tasking them with building a C compiler from scratch.

Over two weeks and nearly 2,000 Claude Code sessions costing about $20,000 in API fees, the AI model agents reportedly produced a 100,000-line Rust-based compiler capable of building a bootable Linux 6.9 kernel on x86, ARM, and RISC-V architectures.

Carlini, a research scientist on Anthropic’s Safeguards team who previously spent seven years at Google Brain and DeepMind, used a new feature launched with Claude Opus 4.6 called “agent teams.” In practice, each Claude instance ran inside its own Docker container, cloning a shared Git repository, claiming tasks by writing lock files, then pushing completed code back upstream. No orchestration agent directed traffic. Each instance independently identified whatever problem seemed most obvious to work on next and started solving it. When merge conflicts arose, the AI model instances resolved them on their own.

The resulting compiler, which Anthropic has released on GitHub, can compile a range of major open source projects, including PostgreSQL, SQLite, Redis, FFmpeg, and QEMU. It achieved a 99 percent pass rate on the GCC torture test suite and, in what Carlini called “the developer’s ultimate litmus test,” compiled and ran Doom.

It’s worth noting that a C compiler is a near-ideal task for semi-autonomous AI model coding: The specification is decades old and well-defined, comprehensive test suites already exist, and there’s a known-good reference compiler to check against. Most real-world software projects have none of these advantages. The hard part of most development isn’t writing code that passes tests; it’s figuring out what the tests should be in the first place.

The compiler also has clear limitations that Carlini was upfront about. It lacks a 16-bit x86 backend needed to boot Linux from real mode, so it calls out to GCC for that step. Its own assembler and linker remain buggy. Even with all optimizations enabled, it produces less efficient code than GCC running with all optimizations disabled. And the Rust code quality, while functional, does not approach what an expert Rust programmer would produce. “The resulting compiler has nearly reached the limits of Opus’s abilities,” Carlini wrote. “I tried (hard!) to fix several of the above limitations but wasn’t fully successful. New features and bugfixes frequently broke existing functionality.”

Those limitations may actually be more informative than the successes. Carlini reports that toward the end of the project, fixing bugs and adding features “frequently broke existing functionality,” a pattern familiar to anyone who has watched a codebase grow beyond the point where any contributor fully understands it.

And that limitation is even more common when dealing with AI coding agents, which lose coherence over time. The model hit this wall at around 100,000 lines, which suggests a practical ceiling for autonomous agentic coding, at least with current models.

Anthropic describes the compiler as a “clean-room implementation” because the agents had no Internet access during development. But that framing is somewhat misleading. The underlying model was trained on enormous quantities of publicly available source code, almost certainly including GCC, Clang, and numerous smaller C compilers. In traditional software development, “clean room” specifically means the implementers have never seen the original code. By that standard, this isn’t one.

On Hacker News, the distinction drew sharp debate, reflective of a controversial reception to the news among developers. “It was rather a brute force attempt to decompress fuzzily stored knowledge contained within the network,” wrote one commenter.

The $20,000 figure also deserves some context. That number covers only API token costs and excludes the billions spent training the model, the human labor Carlini invested in building the scaffolding, and the decades of work by compiler engineers who created the test suites and reference implementations that made the project possible.

And that scaffolding was not trivial, which makes any claim of “autonomous” work on the C compiler among the AI agents dubious. While the headline result is a compiler written without human pair-programming, much of the real work that made the project function involved designing the environment around the AI model agents rather than writing compiler code directly. Carlini spent considerable effort building test harnesses, continuous integration pipelines, and feedback systems tuned for the specific ways language models fail.

He found, for example, that verbose test output polluted the model’s context window, causing it to lose track of what it was doing. To address this, Carlini designed test runners that printed only a few summary lines and logged details to separate files.

He also found that Claude has no sense of time and will spend hours running tests without making progress, so he built a fast mode that samples only 1 percent to 10 percent of test cases. When all 16 agents got stuck trying to fix the same Linux kernel bug simultaneously, he used GCC as a reference oracle, randomly compiling most kernel files with GCC and only a subset with Claude’s compiler, so each agent could work on different bugs in different files.

“Claude will work autonomously to solve whatever problem I give it,” Carlini wrote. “So it’s important that the task verifier is nearly perfect, otherwise Claude will solve the wrong problem.”

None of this should obscure what the project actually demonstrates. A year ago, no language model could have produced anything close to a functional multi-architecture compiler, even with this kind of babysitting and an unlimited budget. The methodology of parallel agents coordinating through Git with minimal human supervision is novel, and the engineering tricks Carlini developed to keep the agents productive (context-aware test output, time-boxing, the GCC oracle for parallelization) could potentially represent useful contributions to the wider use of agentic software development tools.

Carlini himself acknowledged feeling conflicted about his own results. “Building this compiler has been some of the most fun I’ve had recently, but I did not expect this to be anywhere near possible so early in 2026,” he wrote. He also raised concerns rooted in his previous career in penetration testing, noting that “the thought of programmers deploying software they’ve never personally verified is a real concern.”</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">As the 2026 Olympic Winter Games begin today, news articles are swelling with juicy claims that male ski jumpers have injected their penises with fillers to gain a flight advantage.

As the rumor goes, having a bigger bulge on a required 3D body scan taken in the pre-season could earn jumpers extra centimeters of material in their jumpsuits—and a suit’s larger nether regions provide more surface area to glide to the gold. Even a small increase can make a satisfying difference in this sport. A 2025 simulation-based study published in the journal Frontiers in Sports and Active Living suggested that every 2 cm of extra fabric in a ski jumpsuit could increase drag by about 4 percent and increase lift by about 5 percent. On a jump, that extra 2 cm of fabric amounts to an extra 5.8 meters, the simulations found.

Elite ski jumpers are aware of the advantage and have already crotch-rocketed to scandal with related schemes. Last year, two Norwegian Olympic medalists, Marius Lindvik and Johann Andre Forfang, and three of their team officials were charged with cheating after an anonymous video showed the head coach and suit technician illegally restitching the crotch area of the two jumpers’ suits to make them larger. The jumpers received a three-month suspension, while the head coach, an assistant coach, and the technician faced a harsher 18-month ban.

Injections are alleged to be a new, more drastic strategy. Rumors that jumpers were internally padding their peckers first came to light in January, when German newspaper Bild reported that there were “whispers” of jumpers using hyaluronic acid or possibly paraffin injections.

Bild quoted Dr. Kamran Karim, a specialist at Maria-Hilf Hospital in Krefeld, Germany, as saying (translated): “There is the possibility of obtaining a temporary, optical thickening of the penis with the injection of paraffin or hyaluronic acid. … Such an injection, however, is not medically indicated and involves risks.”

On Thursday, the injection claims sprang up again at a press conference in which journalists asked officials of the World Anti-Doping Agency about the claims. The agency’s director general said they were not aware of any claims and that non-doping means of enhancing performance are not in their purview. But according to the BBC, WADA President Witold Banka, who is from Poland, was “clearly entertained” by the questions, responding: “Ski jumping is very popular in Poland, so I promise you I’m going to look at it.”

Bruno Sassi, the communications director for FIS, the international ski and snowboard federation, seemed less amused, telling the BBC, “There has never been any indication, let alone evidence, that any competitor has ever made use of a hyaluronic acid injection to attempt to gain a competitive advantage.”

But what if they did? Here’s what we know about hyaluronic acid and paraffin for penis augmentation.

While some news outlets have played up the “acid” part of its name, hyaluronic acid is not some nefarious flesh-melting hazard. It’s a common filler used for various clinical purposes.

Hyaluronic acid is a polysaccharide that is naturally found in a wide variety of tissues in the human body, including the skin, eyes, and connective tissue. It’s a chief component of the extracellular matrix. It attracts water molecules to itself, creating volume that can provide structural support. In a pure form, it has no tissue or even species specificity and therefore is considered to have little risk of sparking immune responses.

As such, hyaluronic acid gel fillers are used in a variety of medical procedures, with approval from the Food and Drug Administration. Hyaluronic acid (HA) fillers are injected into joints, particularly knees, to relieve pain from mild to moderate arthritis, which can decrease the natural amount of HA in joints. Age also decreases natural levels of HA, and one of the main uses of HA fillers is for cosmetic purposes—plumping lips and cheeks, and minimizing the appearance of wrinkles and fine lines in the face. HA fillers can also be used inside the eye in a variety of surgeries, including cataract extraction and corneal transplants. It can also be used topically for wound care and to relieve skin pain and itching.

For these purposes, the most common adverse effects are pain, bruising, redness, itching, and swelling, which usually last for just a few days. In extremely rare cases, there can be more serious side effects from injections, such as bacterial infections, tissue death (from blocked blood flow), and a granulomatous foreign body reaction, in which the immune system tries to clear a foreign substance, such as bacterial impurities, leading to a collection of immune cells.

A notable feature of HA fillers is that they have something of an antidote. For procedures that go wrong for whatever reason, clinicians can use hyaluronidase, an enzyme that breaks down hyaluronic acid, to dissolve the filler. Hyaluronidase is then rapidly deactivated and degraded in the body. But even without any dissolving, HA fillers offer only temporary effects, lasting between eight weeks and up to six months, for the various established uses.

What is not on the list of established clinical purposes for HA fillers is penis augmentation. But that’s not from a lack of trying. Studies have looked at the possibility of using HA fillers for adding girth and length—and some of have reported positive results. But so far, there’s a lack of evidence to support safety and efficacy. Still, that hasn’t stopped cosmetic clinics around the world from offering it anyway.

In a 2022 study in the Asian Journal of Andrology, researchers in China followed 38 patients who had HA filler injections, which seemed to provide desired results. One month after injections, the men saw an average increase of 3.4 cm in girth and 2.5 cm in length when flaccid. After a year, the measurements had decreased, but were still an increase of 2.4 cm in girth and 1.65 cm in length. Erect girth ended at an average increase of 0.8 cm. The researchers reported that only three patients had complications: two had swelling, and one had bleeding under the skin. All three cases resolved on their own.

However, not all reports are so rosy. In a 2021 case study in BMC Urology, researchers in Australia reported the experience of a 31-year-old man who received penis HA fillers at a cosmetic clinic. He developed a severe penis infection soon after that led to sepsis and multi-organ failure, landing him in the intensive care unit. Doctors ended up surgically removing pus-stained filler from his penis, which laboratory tests found teeming with Streptococcus pyogenes.

Another case study in 2021, published in a Japanese urology journal, reported that a 65-year-old man had to have part of his penis surgically removed after having HA fillers injected into the head of his penis. When he arrived at the hospital, black necrotic lesions and ulcers were readily visible.

While things can go wrong with HA fillers, despite their legitimate clinical uses, the outcomes for paraffin injections are much darker. Amid the Olympics scandal, most of the focus has been on hyaluronic acid. But the initial Bild article introduced speculation that skiers could also use paraffin injections to jack up their junk, which would be a terrible idea.

The use of injections of mineral oil or paraffin wax for cosmetic procedures dates back to at least 1899, when it was almost immediately found to have horrifying results. The injections lead to what’s called paraffinoma, in which the body tries to encapsulate and sequester the oil it can’t degrade. The result is tissue that looks like swiss cheese—with large spaces filled with oil. Over time, the tissue becomes thickened and scarred and can block lymphatic drainage. From the outside, it results in disfiguring and debilitating lesions. Some people initially ignored these disturbing results because, in some cases, the lesions can take years to develop.

While such injections have largely been abandoned, cases occasionally crop up. That includes a 2002 report of a 64-year-old Michigan man who self-injected his penis with mineral oil to increase its girth. He used a series of shots over the course of 18 months. Two years after the last shot, he went to urologists because of an increasing mass in his penis that was causing erectile dysfunction and making it difficult to urinate. He reluctantly admitted to the oil injections only after his doctors suspected cancer. In the end, the doctors had to surgically remove the mass of oily nodules from all around his penis and circumcise him.

Whatever is going on in the trousers of Olympic ski jumpers, let’s hope it doesn’t involve paraffin.</div>

            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2026/02/randomly-quoting-ray-bradbury-did-not-save-lawyer-from-losing-case-over-ai-errors/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Frustrated by fake citations and flowery prose packed with “out-of-left-field” references to ancient libraries and Ray Bradbury’s Fahrenheit 451, a New York federal judge took the rare step of terminating a case this week due to a lawyer’s repeated misuse of AI when drafting filings.

In an order on Thursday, district judge Katherine Polk Failla ruled that the extraordinary sanctions were warranted after an attorney, Steven Feldman, kept responding to requests to correct his filings with documents containing fake citations.

One of those filings was “noteworthy,” Failla said, “for its conspicuously florid prose.” Where some of Feldman’s filings contained grammatical errors and run-on sentences, this filing seemed glaringly different stylistically.

It featured, the judge noted, “an extended quote from Ray Bradbury’s Fahrenheit 451 and metaphors comparing legal advocacy to gardening and the leaving of indelible ‘mark[s] upon the clay.’” The Bradbury quote is below:

“Everyone must leave something behind when he dies, my grandfather said. A child or a book or a painting or a house or a wall built or a pair of shoes made. Or a garden planted. Something your hand touched some way so your soul has somewhere to go when you die, and when people look at that tree or that flower you planted, you’re there. It doesn’t matter what you do, he said, so long as you change something from the way it was before you touched it into something that’s like you after you take your hands away. The difference between the man who just cuts lawns and a real gardener is in the touching, he said. The lawn-cutter might just as well not have been there at all; the gardener will be there a lifetime.”

Another passage Failla highlighted as “raising the Court’s eyebrows” curiously invoked a Bible passage about divine judgment as a means of acknowledging the lawyer’s breach of duty in not catching the fake citations:

“Your Honor, in the ancient libraries of Ashurbanipal, scribes carried their stylus as both tool and sacred trust—understanding that every mark upon clay would endure long beyond their mortal span. As the role the mark (x) in Ezekiel Chapter 9, that marked the foreheads with a tav (x) of blood and ink, bear the same solemn recognition: that the written word carries power to preserve or condemn, to build or destroy, and leaves an indelible mark which cannot be erased but should be withdrawn, let it lead other to think these citations were correct.

I have failed in that sacred trust. The errors in my memorandum, however inadvertent, have diminished the integrity of the record and the dignity of these proceedings. Like the scribes of antiquity who bore their stylus as both privilege and burden, I understand that legal authorship demands more than mere competence—it requires absolute fidelity to truth and precision in every mark upon the page.”

Although the judge believed the “florid prose” signaled that a chatbot wrote the draft, Feldman denied that. In a hearing transcript in which the judge weighed possible sanctions, Feldman testified that he wrote every word of the filings. He explained that he read the Bradbury book “many years ago” and wanted to include “personal things” in that filing. And as for his references to Ashurbanipal, that also “came from me,” he said.

Instead of admitting he had let an AI draft his filings, he maintained that his biggest mistake was relying on various AI programs to review and cross-check citations. Among the tools that he admitted using included Paxton AI, vLex’s Vincent AI, and Google’s NotebookLM. Essentially, he testified that he substituted three rounds of AI review for one stretch reading through all the cases he was citing. That misstep allowed hallucinations and fake citations to creep into the filings, he said.

But the judge pushed back, writing in her order that it was “extremely difficult to believe” that AI did not draft those sections containing overwrought prose. She accused Feldman of dodging the truth.

“The Court sees things differently: AI generated this citation from the start, and Mr. Feldman’s decision to remove most citations and write ‘more of a personal letter&#39;” is “nothing but an ex post justification that seeks to obscure his misuse of AI and his steadfast refusal to review his submissions for accuracy,” Failla wrote.

At the hearing, she expressed frustration and annoyance at Feldman for evading her questions and providing inconsistent responses. Eventually, he testified that he used AI to correct information when drafting one of the filings, which Failla immediately deemed “unwise,” but not the one quoting Bradbury.

Feldman is one of hundreds of lawyers who have relied on AI to draft filings, which have introduced fake citations into cases. Lawyers have offered a wide range of excuses for relying too much on AI. Some have faced small fines, around $150, while others have been slapped with thousands in fines, including one case where sanctions reached $85,000 for repeated, abusive misconduct. At least one law firm has threatened to fire lawyers citing fake cases, and other lawyers have imposed other voluntary sanctions, like taking a yearlong leave of absence.

Seemingly, Feldman did not think sanctions were warranted in this case. In his defense of three filings containing 14 errors out of 60 total citations, Feldman discussed his challenges accessing legal databases due to high subscription costs and short library hours. With more than one case on his plate and his kids’ graduations to attend, he struggled to verify citations during times when he couldn’t make it to the library, he testified. As a workaround, he relied on several AI programs to verify citations that he found by searching on tools like Google Scholar.

Feldman likely did not expect the judge to terminate the case as a result of his AI misuses. Asked how he thought the court should resolve things, Feldman suggested that he could correct the filings by relying on other attorneys to review citations, while avoiding “any use whatsoever of any, you know, artificial intelligence or LLM type of methods.” The judge, however, wrote that his repeated misuses were “proof” that he “learned nothing” and had not implemented voluntary safeguards to catch the errors.

Asked for comment, Feldman told Ars that he did not have time to discuss the sanctions but that he hopes his experience helps raise awareness of how inaccessible court documents are to the public. “Use of AI, and the ability to improve it, exposes a deeper proxy fight over whether law and serious scholarship remain publicly auditable, or drift into closed, intermediary‑controlled systems that undermine verification and due process,” Feldman suggested.

“The real lesson is about transparency and system design, not simply tool failure,” Feldman said.

But at the hearing, Failla said that she thinks Feldman had “access to the walled garden” of legal databases, if only he “would go to the law library” to do his research, rather than rely on AI tools.

“It sounds like you want me to say that you should be absolved of all of these terrible citation errors, these missed citations, because you don’t have Westlaw,” the judge said. “But now I know you have access to Westlaw. So what do you want?”

As Failla explained in her order, she thinks the key takeaway is that Feldman routinely failed to catch his own errors. She said that she has no problem with lawyers using AI to assist their research, but Feldman admitted to not reading the cases that he cited and “apparently” cannot “learn from his mistakes.”

Verifying case citations should never be a job left to AI, Failla said, describing Feldman’s research methods as “redolent of Rube Goldberg.”

“Most lawyers simply call this ‘conducting legal research,’” Failla wrote. “All lawyers must know how to do it. Mr. Feldman is not excused from this professional obligation by dint of using emerging technology.”

His “explanations were thick on words but thin on substance,” the judge wrote. She concluded that he “repeatedly and brazenly” violated Rule 11, which requires attorneys to verify the cases that they cite, “despite multiple warnings.”

Noting that Feldman “failed to fully accept responsibility,” she ruled that case-terminating sanctions were necessary, entering default judgment for the plaintiffs. Feldman may also be on the hook to pay fees for wasting other attorneys’ time.

The hearing transcript has circulated on social media due to the judge’s no-nonsense approach to grilling Feldman, whom she clearly found evasive and lacking credibility.

“Look, if you don’t want to be straight with me, if you don’t want to answer questions with candor, that’s fine,” Failla said. “I’ll just make my own decisions about what I think you did in this case. I’m giving you an opportunity to try and explain something that I think cannot be explained.”

In her order this week, she noted that Feldman “struggled to make eye contact” and left the court without “clear answers.”

Feldman’s errors came in a case in which a toy company sued merchants who allegedly failed to stop selling stolen goods after receiving a cease-and-desist order. His client was among the merchants accused of illegally profiting from the alleged thefts. They faced federal charges of trademark infringement, unfair competition, and false advertising, as well as New York charges, including fostering the sale of stolen goods.

The loss triggers remedies, including an injunction preventing additional sales of stolen goods and refunding every customer who bought them. Feldman’s client must also turn over any stolen goods in their remaining inventory and disgorge profits. Other damages may be owed, along with interest. Ars could not immediately reach an attorney for the plaintiffs to discuss the sanctions order or resulting remedies.

Failla emphasized in her order that Feldman appeared to not appreciate “the gravity of the situation,” repeatedly submitting filings with fake citations even after he had been warned that sanctions could be ordered.

That was a choice, Failla said, noting that Feldman’s mistakes were caught early by a lawyer working for another defendant in the case, Joel MacMull, who urged Feldman to promptly notify the court. The whole debacle would have ended in June 2025, MacMull suggested at the hearing.

Rather than take MacMull’s advice, however, Feldman delayed notifying the court, irking the judge. He testified during the heated sanctions hearing that the delay was due to an effort he quietly undertook, working to correct the filing. He supposedly planned to submit those corrections when he alerted the court to the errors.

But Failla noted that he never submitted corrections, insisting instead that Feldman kept her “in the dark.”

“There’s no real reason why you should have kept this from me,” the judge said.

The court learned of the fake citations only after MacMull notified the judge by sharing emails of his attempts to get Feldman to act urgently. Those emails showed Feldman scolding MacMull for unprofessional conduct after MacMull refused to check Feldman’s citations for him, which Failla noted at the hearing was absolutely not MacMull’s responsibility.

Feldman told Failla that he also thought it was unprofessional for MacMull to share their correspondence, but Failla said the emails were “illuminative.”

At the hearing, MacMull asked if the court would allow him to seek payment of his fees, since he believes “there has been a multiplication of proceedings here that would have been entirely unnecessary if Mr. Feldman had done what I asked him to do that Sunday night in June.”</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Open source packages published on the npm and PyPI repositories were laced with code that stole wallet credentials from dYdX developers and backend systems and, in some cases, backdoored devices, researchers said.

“Every application using the compromised npm versions is at risk ….” the researchers, from security firm Socket, said Friday. “Direct impact includes complete wallet compromise and irreversible cryptocurrency theft. The attack scope includes all applications depending on the compromised versions and both developers testing with real credentials and production end-users.”

dYdX is a decentralized derivatives exchange that supports hundreds of markets for “perpetual trading,” or the use of cryptocurrency to bet that the value of a derivative future will rise or fall. Socket said dYdX has processed over $1.5 trillion in trading volume over its lifetime, with an average trading volume of $200 million to $540 million and roughly $175 million in open interest. The exchange provides code libraries that allow third-party apps for trading bots, automated strategies, or backend services, all of which handle mnemonics or private keys for signing.

The npm malware embedded a malicious function in the legitimate package. When a seed phrase that underpins wallet security was processed, the function exfiltrated it, along with a fingerprint of the device running the app. The fingerprint allowed the threat actor to correlate stolen credentials to track victims across multiple compromises. The domain receiving the seed was dydx[.]priceoracle[.]site, which mimics the legitimate dYdX service at dydx[.]xyz through typosquatting.

The malicious code available on PyPI contained the same credential theft function, although it also implemented a remote access Trojan (RAT) that allowed the execution of new malware on infected systems. The backdoor received commands from dydx[.]priceoracle[.]site. The domain was registered on January 9, 17 days before the malicious package was uploaded to PyPI.

Socket said the packages were published to npm and PyPI by official dYdX accounts, an indication that they were compromised and used by the attackers. dYdX officials didn’t respond to an email seeking confirmation and additional details.

The incident is at least the third time dYdX has been targeted in attacks. Previous events include a September 2022 uploading of malicious code to the npm repository and the commandeering in 2024 of the dYdX v3 website through DNS hijacking. Users were redirected to a malicious site that prompted them to sign transactions designed to drain their wallets.

“Viewed alongside the 2022 npm supply chain compromise and the 2024 DNS hijacking incident, this [latest] attack highlights a persistent pattern of adversaries targeting dYdX-related assets through trusted distribution channels,” Socket said. “The threat actor simultaneously compromised packages in both npm and PyPI ecosystems, expanding the attack surface to reach JavaScript and Python developers working with dYdX.”

Anyone using the platform should carefully examine all apps for dependencies on the malicious packages listed above.</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">After writing two November stories analyzing price expectations for Valve’s upcoming Steam Machine, I really didn’t think we’d be offering more informed speculation before the official price was revealed. Then Valve wrote a blog post this week noting that the “growing price of… critical components” like RAM and storage meant that “we must revisit our exact shipping schedule and pricing” for the living room-focused PC gaming box.

We don’t know exactly what form that “revisiting” will take at the moment. Analysts who spoke to Ars were somewhat divided on how much of its quickly increasing component costs Valve would be willing (or forced) to pass on to consumers.

“We knew the component issue was bad,” DFC Intelligence analyst David Cole told Ars. “It has just gotten worse. “

How much worse has the pricing situation gotten for Valve since November? Superdata Research founder and SuperJoost newsletter author Joost van Dreunen suggested that the 512GB Steam Machine model would probably run $50 to $75 more than he expected when the Steam Machine was announced, and to expect a price “potentially $100+ above target” for the high-end 2TB model. That would mean a $599 to $629 price at the low-end and $849 to $899 for the high-end model, in his estimation.

Wedbush Morgan analyst Michael Pachter agreed that, even with the additional component costs, Valve would likely “try to get it out at $599 or so for the 512GB version,” A starting price higher than that would mean “abysmal” sales, he added. “I think $700 is a death sentence and $1,000 is unsellable.”

Other analysts think that Pachter’s “unsellable” price for the Steam Machine is increasingly plausible now, though. DFC’s Cole said possible prices for the Steam Machine are now “approaching $1,000,” with the 512GB model perhaps $100 less than 2TB model. But F-Squared analyst Michael Futter expected an even bigger gap between the two models, saying the 512GB model “could crest $1,000” and the 2TB model would likely fall somewhere in the $1,300 to $1,500 range.

On the surface, it might seem like every company making gaming hardware would be similarly affected by increasing component costs. In practice, though, analysts suggested that Valve might be in a uniquely bad position to absorb this ongoing market disruption.

Large console makers like Sony and Microsoft “can commit to tens of millions of orders, and have strong negotiating power,” Niko Partners analyst Daniel Ahmad pointed out. The Steam Machine, on the other hand, is “a niche product that cannot benefit in the same way when it comes to procurement,” meaning Valve has to shoulder higher component cost increases.

F-Squared’s Futter echoed that Valve is “not an enormous player in the hardware space, even with the Steam Deck’s success. So they likely don’t have the same kind of priority as a Nintendo, Sony, or Microsoft when it comes to suppliers.”

The size of the Steam Machine price adjustment also might depend on when Valve made its supply chain commitments. “It’s not clear when or if Valve locked in supply contracts for the Steam Machine, or if supply can be diverted from the Steam Deck for the new product,” Tech Insights analyst James Sanders noted. On the other hand, “Sony and Microsoft likely will have locked in more favorable component pricing before the current spike,” Van Dreunen said.

That said, some other aspects of the Steam Machine design could give Valve some greater pricing flexibility. Sanders noted that the Steam Machine’s smaller physical size could mean smaller packaging and reduced shipping costs for Valve. And selling the system primarily through direct sales via the web and Steam itself eliminates the usual retailer markups console makers have to take into account, he added.

“I think Valve was hoping for a much lower price and that the component issue would be short-term,” Cole said. “Obviously it is looking more like a long-term issue.”

So, if Valve is forced to significantly increase the asking price of the Steam Machine, does that mean significantly fewer people will be willing to buy it? Not necessarily. DFC’s Cole said that this kind of gaming hardware already has “a fairly niche built-in audience that will not be too price sensitive.”

Van Dreunen agreed that the Steam Machines’ “core audience, PC gamers who want a living room setup without the hassle of a full build, will absorb a $50 to $100 price increase without much hesitation.” But that core audience might not be very large; Pachter said that, even with a $599 starting price, the Steam Machine would “likely sell no more than 5 million [units].” At a higher starting price, he saw total sales going down quickly.

The analysts who spoke to Ars agreed that recent price increases for every major game console gave Valve a little more competitive breathing room regarding pricing. But the relative price difference between Valve and the other console makers will still matter, they said.

“While Valve may have been aiming to price its Steam Machine in line with the PS5/Xbox Series X|S at one point, or potentially undercut it, it’s now clear that the company may have to price it above these competitors,” Ahmad said. “At a time when multiple competitors exist on the market, we believe the higher price will limit the audience for the Steam Machine going forward.”

Futter agreed that whichever company could offer the lowest-cost machine that could plausibly offer 4K, 60 fps performance in most modern games (as the Steam Machine is targeting) would reap great benefits in the market. But even if the Steam Machine isn’t cheaper than competing high-end consoles, Futter said Valve’s hardware would appeal to those who “want to get into [high-end] PC gaming and can’t absorb $2,500+ for access to the Steam ecosystem.”

In the end, how Valve handles Steam Machine pricing might depend on whether the company wants to “expand SteamOS beyond the enthusiast base and into territory currently held by PlayStation and Xbox,” as Van Dreunen put it. “The memory cost shock doesn’t threaten Valve’s ability to sell to its existing audience. It threatens the pace at which it can grow a new one.”</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Black holes are born from the explosive deaths of stars. But can black holes themselves explode? Nobody knows for sure — but if they can, a team of scientists argue they may have spotted evidence of such a catastrophe taking place.

Their study, published in Physical Review Letters, suggests that the impossibly powerful collision of a subatomic particle called a neutrino into the Earth detected in 2023 could be explained by the explosion of a special kind of cosmic object called a primordial black hole.

Black holes have expiration dates. It’s just that their lifespan is so long unbelievably long that there simply hasn’t been enough time to see one wink out. In 1974, Stephen Hawking hypothesized that the objects slowly release energy due to strange quantum effects near their event horizons. This slow trickle of energy is now called Hawking radiation, with modern calculations estimating it would take a time period of quadrillions upon quadrillions of times longer than the current age of the Universe for a black hole to completely “evaporate.”

But Hawking also theorized that black holes could also come in the form of primordial black holes, formed not from the death of a star, but from the extreme conditions that existed mere instants after the Big Bang. The cosmos should be swarming in these, but none have ever been detected. Perhaps that’s because they could theoretically be as small as an atom, and their elusiveness has led to them being a potential candidate for dark matter, the invisible substance thought to account for roughly 85 percent of all mass in the cosmos.

Yet it turns out that lighter black holes could also explode, releasing detectable outburst of particles, according to the researchers.

“The lighter a black hole is, the hotter it should be and the more particles it will emit,” coauthor Andrea Thamm, assistant professor of physics at UMass Amherst, said in a statement about the work. “As PBHs evaporate, they become ever lighter, and so hotter, emitting even more radiation in a runaway process until explosion. It’s that Hawking radiation that our telescopes can detect.”

That leads us back to our puzzling neutrino that collided with Earth in 2023. It released more energy than thought possible for any one particle to emit. One explanation is that this was a fluke or error, since it wasn’t detected by other observatories. The non-boring answer, however, is that this was the work of a primordial black hole imbued with a “dark charge,” a hypothetical twin to the conventional electrical force that’s driven by a “dark electron.”

“A PBH with a dark charge,” explained Thamm, “has unique properties and behaves in ways that are different from other, simpler PBH models. We have shown that this can provide an explanation of all of the seemingly inconsistent experimental data.”

It’s a very fringe and esoteric explanation. But it does come with the added bonus of explaining another big cosmological mystery.

“If our hypothesized dark charge is true,” coauthor Joaquim Iguaz Juan , a physics researcher at UMass Amherst, said in the statement, “then we believe there could be a significant population of PBHs, which would be consistent with other astrophysical observations, and account for all the missing dark matter in the universe.”

            <div id="article-text">Following the federal government’s wide-armed embrace of the tech, professional gamblers are flooding into prediction markets like Kalshi and Polymarket.

It’s not hard to see why: in January alone, trading volume on Kalshi almost hit $10 billion, $8.5 billion of which was tied to sports, according to new reporting by Bloomberg. That same month, Kalshi saw three million new downloads.

The waters, in other words, are teeming with prey — and the sharks are moving in.

No longer content to ply their trade on the predatory betting apps of yore — the FanDuels, DraftKings and BetMGMs of the app world — professional gamblers have discovered a lucrative new playground in the wildly unregulated land of prediction markets.

“It really feels like everything’s prediction markets, prediction markets, prediction markets,” Rufus Peabody, a professional gambler with 15 years of experience told Bloomberg. “Maybe not for the average recreational bettor, but certainly in the sharp community.”

In gambling parlance, “sharps” are the pros: the full-time bettors who win more often than they lose. And for these gamblers, prediction markets represent a whole new ecosystem of marks, like you, who have far less information and expertise to devote to making well-informed bets than they do.

As Bloomberg notes, traditional sports books take the other side of every wager they collect. Prediction markets, however, pit bettors against each other, resembling something closer to Wall Street than to seedy betting parlors. This fundamental change in structure makes prediction markets a goldmine for intelligent, well-resourced sharps.

“Sharp bettors are looking for every place they can where they have an advantage,” Peabody told Bloomberg. “Right now there’s a lot of alpha to be had on the prediction markets,” he said, referring to the betting term for competitive advantage.

On top of small operations like the one Peabody runs, amateur gamblers are increasingly going up against actual financial firms like Susquehanna International Group and Jump Trading, which are groups capable of betting tens of millions of dollars every week.

All of this is to say: before you place that prop bet on the Super Bowl this weekend, you might want to think about who could be on the other end of the line.

            <div id="article-text">Astronomers have discovered what appears to be an exoplanet that could be a distant Earthly paradise. Or it could be a frigid realm even chillier than Mars, incapable of supporting life.

The margins are very fine when studying planets outside our solar system. But this new candidate planet, dubbed HD 137010 b, is an especially promising detection that hints at a habitable world that in many ways appears to mirror our own.

As detailed in a new study published in The Astrophysical Journal Letters and highlighted by NASA, the rocky outpost orbits a Sun-like star and is nearly the same size as Earth. Its orbit is almost a carbon copy, too, equal to around 355 Earth days. Even better? It’s practically next door.

“What’s very exciting about this particular Earth-sized planet is that its star is only [about] 150 light-years away from our solar system,” coauthor Chelsea Huang, a researcher at the University of Southern Queensland in Australia, told The Guardian. “The next best planet around a sun-like star, in a habitable zone, [Kepler-186f] is about four times farther away and 20 times fainter.”

The researchers discovered the candidate world while examining data gathered by the NASA Kepler space telescope in 2017. It captured only a single transit of the exoplanet, in which it passes in front of its star and causes a detectable dip in light. This left behind enough clues to infer its size and speed.

The big and obvious difference between our star system and the candidate exoplanet’s is the star itself. Our Sun is considered a G-type yellow dwarf, steadily burning at a moderate temperature for billions of years. But HD 137010 is a K-type orange dwarf, which is slightly smaller and cooler. That means the candidate exoplanet potentially receives less than a third of the light and heat that the Earth does, with estimated temperatures lower than minus 90 degrees Fahrenheit. Mars, for comparison, is around minus 85 degrees Fahrenheit.

There’s significant debate among astronomers over whether smaller stars like orange and red dwarfs are ideal hosts for habitable worlds because of how closely a planet needs to orbit them to stay in their habitable zone. At such proximity, a planet could be “tidally locked” to the star, a state in which it’s unable to rotate, forcing the same side of the planet to face the star for eternity.

That said, there’s a good chance that HD 137010 b could be a temperate and even watery world if it has a much more carbon dioxide rich atmosphere than Earth, allowing it to trap what little heat it receives. Mars is thought to have once been warm and wet, too, before its atmosphere, which may have also been swimming with CO2, largely vanished billions of years ago.

Follow-up observations are needed before the matter is settled. Sara Webb, an astrophysicist at Swinburne University, called the discovery “exciting” but told The Guardian that three transits, not just one, are considered the “gold standard” for planetary science. Still, Huang says the detection was a “textbook example” of a planetary transit, thanks to the closeness and brightness of the star.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Microsoft has continued to focus more and more on AI — almost certainly at the expense of its core products, like the Windows operating system. And unfortunately for the Redmond giant, the gambit doesn’t seem to be paying off.

Current and former employees tell The Wall Street Journal in new reporting that the company’s confusing branding and grating lack of cohesion between its products has frustrated and turned off users. And data reviewed by the newspaper shows that a vanishingly small percentage of its enterprise customers prefer using its AI chatbot and assistant Copilot, which appears to be losing ground to its competitors at Google, OpenAI, and Anthropic.

The report comes after a historically miserable day at the stock market for Microsoft last week, which saw its share price collapse by nearly 12 percent, a sign of investor doubts over CEO Satya Nadella’s AI-first vision and the company’s exorbitant spending in its pursuit.

Microsoft is certainly giving OpenAI a run for its money in the bad-branding department. It has multiple versions of Copilot woven across its different services and software — too many versions, you might argue. Do you need Microsoft 365 Copilot, or Microsoft 365 Copilot Chat? What about just plain old Microsoft Copilot, or Microsoft Copilot Studio? If you’re more nerdy, you might prefer Github Copilot or Microsoft Security Copilot. These, of course, shouldn’t be confused with its older offerings like Microsoft Copilot Pro, or Copilot+ for PCs. Hey, maybe those employees had a point!

The gist is that Copilots are divided into different groups for different customers: one for general consumers, one for programmers and developers, and an enterprise Copilot for companies and professionals.

Nonetheless, because it’s Microsoft, it can still bring in a large user base even if it’s dual-wielding pistols to shoot itself in the foot. Last week, it reported that it had sold 15 million Microsoft 365 Copilot “seats” or annual users, out of 450 million Microsoft 365 business subscribers over all.

But that user base is starting to be ebbed away, according to previously unreported data from the market research firm Recon Analytics. Its survey of more than 150,000 US customers cited by the WSJ showed that from July 2025 to this January, the share of Copilot subscribers — as in paying customers — who preferred using it as their primary chatbot plummeted from 18.8 percent to 11.5 percent. Meanwhile, the share of people who used Google’s Gemini nudged upward from 12.8 percent to 15.7 percent.

A note by analysts at Citi Research provides another brutal statistic: some companies are only using about 10 percent of the Copilot subscription “seats” they paid for, per WSJ’s reporting. Customers complained that the Copilot versions were confusing, that that they didn’t like having Copilot forced on them, and that its different AI models didn’t integrate with each other well. If you wanted to take something you were working on with your workplace AI and continue working on with your consumer AI model, the experience would be frustrating and clumsy.

(Without providing specifics, a Microsoft spokesperson pushed back against the WSJ‘s reporting, saying that the “pace of growth that we’re seeing is unlike anything we’ve seen before.)

One place that Copilot does seem to be taking off? Microsoft. Chief AI transformation officer — which we assure you is a real job title — Pam Maynard told the WSJ that the adoption rate within Microsoft’s sales organization has shot up from 20 percent to over 70 percent in the past year. Maynard attributes this to employees being more comfortable with AI, but it’s also clear that the company’s leadership has heavily pushed embracing the tech, with employees being asked to quantify how they’re using tools like Copilot at work, people familiar with the matter told the WSJ. (CEO Satya Nadella has previously boasted that over a quarter of the company’s code is written with AI.)

The survey findings will only add to investor uncertainty over Microsoft’s ballooning AI spending, which saw its stock plummet last Thursday after the release of its latest quarterly earnings. They showed that although its net profits increased to $31 billion, its expenditures grew by 66 percent to $37.5 billion. Further sucking the air out of the room, revenue growth in its Azure cloud computing sector, the backbone of many of its AI efforts, showed a disappointingly modest growth in revenue of 38 percent, which was slightly worse than the year before.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">When past generations imagined the best version of the future, it was one of leisure. Advertisements, cartoonists, and pulp novelists dared us to dream of a world where the spoils of industrial development were shared with all: robot butlers, transit by pneumatic tube, and more familiar tropes. These developments, it seemed, would make our lives more convenient, more secure, and — dare we say — more abundant.

Now in 2026, it’s clear that even the most modest utopian fantasies have been stolen by the wealthy. The rich have luxurious self-driving cars while the rest of us suffer with crumbling public transit. The rich treat housing as an asset, while the rest of us navigate algorithms meant to maximize rent extraction. The rich have elite private schools, while the rest of us content ourselves to teacher shortages and glitchy AI tutors.

Going forward, the disparity is likely to widen. Having established their giddy desire to automate white collar jobs, tech moguls are increasingly turning their attention toward the trades — jobs which were, rhetorically at least, seen as a safe haven against AI’s rising tide. Now, the boom in robotics and AI spending is driving fear that blue collar labor will be next on the chopping block.

“It’s a whole other challenge on top of the large language models,” Communications Workers of America Union assistant research director Dan Reynolds told Politico about the heightened threat of physical automation. “Having an automated system interacting with the real physical world is a separate… mountain to climb.”

As tech companies look to shoehorn AI software into robotic platforms, it can be difficult for labor organizers to separate actual threats from typical tech industry bluster. Either way, the rapid pace is alarming.

“Our concern right now is [AI robotics] is just moving too quickly, and so it makes it difficult to plan for how this is actually going to affect workers, and what employers are going to do,” David White, director of strategic resources at the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, told Politico. “We are keeping an eye on that as much as we can.”

Labor leaders who spoke to Politico say they’re trying to elbow their way into the conversation as early as possible. As layoffs across the US job market only seem to increase, part of the challenge will be successfully anticipating productive developments in automated systems — easier said than done.

“We’ve been hearing for at least 15 years that we’re going to have driverless trucks next year,” International Brotherhood of Teamsters media coordinator Matt McQuaid told the outlet. “There’s a lot of overpromising and under delivering in the tech industry.”

Still, not having a union prepared to fight automation is a recipe for disaster. While today’s notoriously buggy AI may not actually be capable of replacing human workers, that hasn’t stopped executives from using it as an excuse to cut jobs anyway. If the last few years of AI development have made anything clear, it’s that the tech elite aren’t interested in sharing the future — they want it all to themselves.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Darren Aronofsky has always been a divisive filmmaker. But the director of hits like “Black Swan,” “The Wrestler,” and “Requiem for a Dream” has now almost certainly blown up his credibility even with his die-hard fans, after cranking out an almost completely AI-generated historical video series.

Called “On This Day … 1776,” the show, which consists of several-minute “episodes,” is meant to cover notable events that took place in the American Revolutionary War, but has instead mostly drawn attention to how awful its AI visuals look, on top of its persistent anachronisms. Colonists living in houses with modern vinyl siding? Sure, why not.

The reviews, predictably, are brutal. In one titled “Requiem for a film-maker,” The Guardian’s Stuart Heritage blasted its faux-photorealism aesthetic as “ugly as sin,” and called out its overreliance on center-framed, back-of-the-head shots. “This is, after all, because the back of an AI-generated head is far less likely to send people into screaming fits of trauma than an AI-generated face,” Heritage wrote.

“‘On This Day … 1776’ is genuinely very horrible to watch,” he concluded, “and everybody involved should be ashamed. It is by far the most disturbing thing Aronofsky has made, and I’ve seen the last eight minutes of ‘Requiem for a Dream.&#39;”

It’s hard not to agree. The entire show operates in the mode of meaningless montage, because stitching together a collection of barely-related, aesthetically generic shots is the only mode of “filmmaking” that AI is suited for. The effect is like watching an extended advert. But whereas a commercial usually has the good manners to wrap up in less than a minute, Aronofsky’s monstrosity slogs on with its cavalcade of quick-cutting but slowly-moving close-ups, as if to demonstrate to maximum effect how utterly inane this all looks.

Big names are attached to the series. The show is a collaboration between Aronofsky’s AI studio Primordial Soup, Google’s DeepMind lab, Salesforce, and TIME Studios. This isn’t being sold to us as the work of Aronofsky sitting in his bedroom somewhere and typing in AI prompts. This is supposed to be the high watermark of what AI can bring to the table.

“But keep watching for more than a few seconds, and it quickly becomes apparent that slop is slop, no matter how it’s gussied up,” wrote Angie Han for The Hollywood Reporter. “‘On This Day’ positions itself as a well-funded, high-profile, apparently good-faith effort to demonstrate how AI might be deployed as a tool to enhance rather than replace human artistry. Instead, it only goes to show that the problem with AI in filmmaking runs deeper than its technical limitations.”

“How depressing is it” it continues, “that with the guidance of a visionary filmmaker like Aronofsky, with the lavish financial backing of companies like Google and Salesforce, this thing — a pair of shoddy, TikTok-length clips that would barely pass muster as animated illustrations for a high-school history lesson, let alone coherent pieces of storytelling in their own right — was the best anyone could make of the supposedly boundless limitations of AI?”

Aronofsky, by the way, was at one point slated to direct a biopic about Elon Musk. Now, it seems like he’s drunk the same AI Kool-Aid that Musk has been pounding.

            <h2>India has changed its startup rules for deep tech</h2>
            <p><strong>TechCrunch | 2026-02-08</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/07/india-has-changed-its-startup-rules-for-deep-tech/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Deep tech startups in sectors such as space, semiconductors, and biotech take far longer to mature than conventional ventures. Because of that India is adjusting its startup rules, and mobilizing public capital, hoping to help more of them make it to commercial products.

This week, the Indian government updated its startup framework, doubling the period for which deep tech companies are treated as startups to 20 years and raising the revenue threshold for startup-specific tax, grant, and regulatory benefits to ₹3 billion (about $33.12 million), from ₹1 billion (around $11.04 million) previously. The change aims to align policy timelines with the long development cycles typical of science- and engineering-led businesses.

The change also forms part of New Delhi’s effort to build a long-horizon deep tech ecosystem by combining regulatory reform with public capital, including the ₹1 trillion (around $11 billion) Research, Development and Innovation Fund (RDI), announced last year. That fund is intended to expand patient financing for science-led and R&D-driven companies. Against that backdrop, U.S. and Indian venture firms later came together to launch the India Deep Tech Alliance, $1 billion-plus private investor coalition that includes Accel, Blume Ventures, Celesta Capital, Premji Invest, Ideaspring Capital, Qualcomm Ventures, and Kalaari Capital, with chipmaker Nvidia acting as an adviser.

For founders, these changes may fix what some see as an artificial pressure point. Under the previous framework,  companies often risked losing startup status while still pre-commercial, creating a “false failure signal” that judged science-led ventures on policy timelines rather than technological progress, said Vishesh Rajaram, founding partner at Speciale Invest, an Indian deep tech venture capital firm.

“By formally recognizing deep tech as different, the policy reduces friction in fundraising, follow-on capital, and engagement with the state, which absolutely shows up in a founder’s operating reality over time,” Rajaram told TechCrunch.

Still, investors say access to capital remains a more binding constraint, particularly beyond the early stages. “The biggest gap has historically been funding depth at Series A and beyond, especially for capital-intensive deep tech companies,” Rajaram said. That is where the government’s earlier RDI fund is meant to play a complementary role.

“The real benefit of the RDI framework is to increase the funding available to deep tech companies at early and growth stages,” said Arun Kumar, managing partner at Celesta Capital. By routing public capital through venture funds with tenors similar to private capital, he said, the fund is designed to address chronic gaps in follow-on funding without altering the commercial criteria that govern private investment decisions.

Siddarth Pai, founding partner at 3one4 Capital and co-chair of regulatory affairs at the Indian Venture and Alternate Capital Association, said India’s deep tech framework avoids a “graduation cliff” that has historically cut companies off from support just as they scale.

These policy changes come as the RDI fund is beginning to take shape operationally, Pai said, with the first batch of fund managers identified and the process of selecting venture and private equity managers under way.

While private capital for deep tech already exists in India — particularly in areas such as biotech — Pai told TechCrunch the RDI Fund is intended to act as a nucleus around which greater capital formation can occur. Unlike a traditional fund-of-funds, he noted, the vehicle is also designed to take direct positions and provide credit and grants to deep tech startups.

In terms of scale, India remains an emerging rather than dominant deep tech market. Indian deep tech startups have raised $8.54 billion in total to date, but recent data point to renewed momentum. Indian deep tech startups raised $1.65 billion in 2025, a sharp rebound from $1.1 billion in each of the previous two years after funding peaked at $2 billion in 2022, per Tracxn. The recovery suggests growing investor confidence, particularly in areas aligned with national priorities such as advanced manufacturing, defence, climate technologies, and semiconductors.

“Overall, the pickup in funding suggests a gradual move toward longer-horizon investing,” said Neha Singh, co-founder of Tracxn.

In comparison, U.S. deep tech startups raised about $147 billion in 2025, more than 80 times the amount deployed in India that year, while China accounted for roughly $81 billion, data from Tracxn shows.

The disparity highlights the challenge India faces in building capital-intensive technologies, even with its wealth of engineering talent. So the hope is that these moves by the Indian government will lead to more investor participation over the medium term.

For global investors, New Delhi’s framework change is being read as a signal of longer-term policy intent rather than a trigger for immediate shifts in allocation. “Deep tech companies operate on seven- to twelve-year horizons, so regulatory recognition that stretches the lifecycle gives investors greater confidence that the policy environment will not change mid-journey,” said Pratik Agarwal, a partner at Accel. While he said the change would not alter allocation models overnight or eliminate policy risk entirely, it increased investor comfort that India is thinking about deep tech on longer time horizons.

“The change shows that India is learning from the U.S. and Europe on how to create patient frameworks for frontier building,” Agarwal told TechCrunch.

Whether the move will reduce the tendency of Indian startups to shift their headquarters overseas as they scale remains an open question.

The extended runway strengthens the case for building and staying in India, Agarwal said, though access to capital and customers still matters. Over the past five years, he added, India’s public markets have shown a growing appetite for venture-backed tech companies, making domestic listings a more credible option than in the past. That, in turn, could ease some of the pressure on deep tech founders to incorporate overseas, even if access to procurement and late-stage capital will continue to shape where companies ultimately scale.

For investors backing long-horizon technologies, the ultimate test will be whether India can deliver globally competitive outcomes. The real signal, Kumar of Celesta Capital said, would be the emergence of a critical mass of Indian deep tech companies succeeding on the world stage.

“It would be great to see ten globally competitive deep tech companies from India achieve sustained success over the next decade,” he said, describing that as the benchmark he would look for in assessing whether India’s deep tech ecosystem is maturing.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The Super Bowl is happening in Silicon Valley this Sunday, and the Patriots-Seahawks game at Levi’s Stadium is going to be packed with tech money. YouTube CEO Neal Mohan is expected to be there. Apple’s Tim Cook, too. (He has become a Super Bowl fixture since Apple Music began sponsoring the halftime show several years ago.)

Longtime VC Venky Ganesan from Menlo Ventures gave the New York Times a quote about the whole thing, saying the Super Bowl in the Bay Area is “tech billionaires who got picked last in gym class paying $50,000 to pretend they’re friends with the guys who got picked first.” Added Ganesan, “And for the record, I, too, was picked last in gym class.”

Ganesan could likely afford a $50,000 ticket if he needed one. Menlo went all-in on Anthropic, setting up a $100 million fund with the AI company in summer 2024 to invest in other AI startups. The firm has also joined numerous funding rounds for Anthropic itself, both through its flagship fund and various special purpose vehicles. (Anthropic is reportedly expected to close a $20 billion round of funding next week at a post-money valuation of $350 billion.)

Tickets are expensive across the board, averaging almost $7,000 according to the Times (with some last-minute seats still available on StubHub for closer to $3,600, according to a quick glance at the ticket reseller site). Only a quarter go to the general public; the rest are distributed to NFL teams. Of all ticket buyers, the largest group (27%) is coming from Washington State for the Seahawks, who’ve won just one Super Bowl in franchise history compared with the Patriots’ six titles, all with Tom Brady at quarterback.

Google, OpenAI, Anthropic, Amazon, and Meta are splashing out for competing ads about whose AI is best for customers, so maybe their respective CEOs will show up, too. Other than Amazon’s Andy Jassy, who reportedly splits his time between Seattle and Santa Monica, all of them have homes within an hour or so of Sunday’s game.

This is just the third time the Bay Area has hosted the Super Bowl. The first time was in 1985 at Stanford Stadium, the original football stadium at Stanford University, where the 49ers beat the Dolphins. The second took place 10 years ago at Levi’s Stadium, when the Broncos beat the Panthers.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Giannis Antetokounmpo of the Milwaukee Bucks announced Friday that he has joined prediction market Kalshi as a shareholder, making him the first NBA player to invest directly in the company.

“The internet is full of opinions. I decided it was time to make some of my own,” said the two-time NBA MVP in a social media post. “Today, I’m joining Kalshi as a shareholder. We all on Kalshi now.”

The announcement has not gone over well on social media. On Reddit, for example, one user described it as “literally a conflict of interest,” while another described Kalshi as “cancerous” and yet another wondered, “is this even allowed.”

According to The Athletic, the NBA’s recent collective bargaining agreement allows players to advertise and take stakes of up to 1% in sports betting companies, as long as they’re not promoting league-related wagers.

Kalshi said it will partner with Antetokounmpo on marketing and live events — and in accordance with the company’s “strict terms of service that ban insider trading and market manipulation,” he will not be allowed to trade on markets related to the NBA.

            <h2>New York lawmakers propose a three-year pause on new data centers</h2>
            <p><strong>TechCrunch | 2026-02-07</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/07/new-york-lawmakers-propose-a-three-year-pause-on-new-data-centers/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">New Yorker state lawmakers have introduced a bill that would impose a moratorium of at least three years on permits tied to the construction and operation of new data centers. While the bill’s prospects are uncertain, Wired reports that New York is at least the sixth state to consider pausing construction of new data centers.

As tech companies plan to spend ever-increasing amounts of money to build AI infrastructure, both Democrats and Republicans have expressed concerns about the impact those data centers might have on surrounding communities. Studies have also linked data centers to increased home electricity bills.

Critics include progressive Senator Bernie Sanders, who has called for a national moratorium, as well as conservative Florida Governor Ron De Santis, who said data centers will lead to “higher energy bills just so some chatbot can corrupt some 13 year old kid online.”

More than 230 environmental groups including Food & Water Watch, Friends of the Earth, and Greenpeace recently signed an open letter to Congress calling for a national moratorium on the construction of new data centers.

Eric Weltman of Food & Water Watch told Wired that the New York bill — sponsored by state senator Liz Krueger and assemblymember Anna Kelles, both Democrats — was “our idea.” Data center pauses have also been proposed by Democrats in Georgia, Vermont, and Virginia, while Republicans sponsored similar bills in Maryland and Oklahoma.

According to Politico, Krueger described her state as “completely unprepared” for the “massive data centers” that are “gunning for New York.”

“It’s time to hit the pause button, give ourselves some breathing room to adopt strong policies on data centers, and avoid getting caught in a bubble that will burst and leave New York utility customers footing a huge bill,” she said.

Last month, New York Governor Kathy Hochul announced a new initiative called Energize NY Development, which her office said would both modernize the way large energy users (i.e., data centers) would connect to the grid while also requiring them to “pay their fair share.”

            <h2>Benchmark raises $225M in special funds to double down on Cerebras</h2>
            <p><strong>TechCrunch | 2026-02-07</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/06/benchmark-raises-225m-in-special-funds-to-double-down-on-cerebras/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">This week, AI chipmaker Cerebras Systems announced that it raised $1 billion in fresh capital at a valuation of $23 billion — a nearly threefold increase from the $8.1 billion valuation the Nvidia rival had reached just six months earlier.

While the round was led by Tiger Global, a huge part of the new capital came from one of the company’s earliest backers: Benchmark Capital. The prominent Silicon Valley firm invested at least $225 million in Cerebras’ latest round, according to a person familiar with the deal.

Benchmark first bet on 10-year-old Cerebras when it led the startup’s $27 million Series A in 2016. Since Benchmark deliberately keeps its funds under $450 million, the firm raised two separate vehicles, both called ‘Benchmark Infrastructure,’ according to regulatory filings. According to the person familiar with the deal, these vehicles were created specifically to fund the Cerebras investment.

What sets Cerebras apart is the sheer physical scale of its processors. The company’s Wafer Scale Engine, its flagship chip announced in 2024, measures approximately 8.5 inches on each side and packs 4 trillion transistors into a single piece of silicon. To put that in perspective, the chip is manufactured from nearly an entire 300-millimeter silicon wafer, the circular discs that serve as the foundation for all semiconductor production. Traditional chips are thumbnail-sized fragments cut from these wafers; Cerebras instead uses almost the whole circle.

This architecture delivers 900,000 specialized cores working in parallel, allowing the system to process AI calculations without shuffling data between multiple separate chips (a major bottleneck in conventional GPU clusters). The company says the design enables AI inference tasks to run more than 20 times faster than competing systems.

The funding comes as Cerebras, based in Sunnyvale, Calif., gains momentum in the AI infrastructure race. Last month, Cerebras signed a multi-year agreement worth more than $10 billion to provide 750 megawatts of computing power to OpenAI. The partnership, which extends through 2028, aims to help OpenAI deliver faster response times for complex AI queries. (OpenAI CEO Sam Altman is also an investor in Cerebras.)

Cerebras claims its systems, built with its proprietary chips designed for AI use, are faster than Nvidia’s chips.

The company’s path to going public has been complicated by its relationship with G42, a UAE-based AI firm that accounted for 87% of Cerebras’ revenue as of the first half of 2024. G42’s historical ties to Chinese technology companies triggered a national security review by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, bumping back Cerebras’ initial IPO plans and even prompting the outfit to withdraw an earlier filing in early 2025. By late last year, G42 had been removed from Cerebras’ investor list, clearing the way for a fresh IPO attempt.

Cerebras is now preparing for a public debut in the second quarter of 2026, according to Reuters.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The war on California’s proposed ‘Billionaire’s Tax’ is getting weird. This week, amid ongoing rancor from tech elites over the much maligned bill, it became apparent that someone was planning a so-called “March for Billionaires” in San Francisco. A website advertising the event popped up online, providing little in the way of context other than a pithy tagline: “Vilifying billionaires is popular. Losing them is expensive.”

The immediate reaction was incredulity, and most people assumed the site was some sort of bizarre hoax. “this is a joke/satire right??” one social media user wrote not long after the news circulated. Now, however, the apparent organizer behind the event has revealed that the march is definitelynot a joke, and that it is scheduled to take place this coming Saturday.

The San Francisco Examiner first reported that the event’s organizer had been revealed as Derik Kauffman, the founder of AI startup RunRL, which previously participated in Y Combinator’s accelerator program. Kauffman told the Examiner that the event was not being funded or organized by any outside group, no big monied associations or companies—just him.

In a conversation with TechCrunch, Kauffman — who also told the Examiner that he was no longer involved with RunRL — confirmed that the impetus for the upcoming rally was California’s proposed wealth tax, which the tech founder said he believed would be “quite damaging to the tech economy.”

The policy in question, the Billionaire Tax Act, was introduced last year, and would require Californians worth over $1 billion to pay a one-time 5% tax on their total wealth. The legislation, which is backed by the state’s healthcare union SEIU (Service Employees International Union), could pay for important public services and help the state offset recent federal funding cuts, according to some experts. Nevertheless, the policy has led to loud protestations from some of the tech industry’s most prominent figures, many of whom have either threatened to leave California or have already left. It has also led to a monsoon of lobbying in the California legislature, in an effort to defeat the bill.

When asked why he opposed the legislation, Kauffman expressed concern for how the bill could impact the startup economy in Silicon Valley. “This tax in particular is fatally flawed,” he said. “It hits startup founders whose wealth is only on paper. They would be forced to liquidate shares on potentially unfavorable terms, incurring capital gains taxes and giving up control. Not to mention the difficulty of valuing private companies.”

“Many founders would be hit with wildly disproportionate tax bills,” Kauffman continued. “Additionally, there’s no precedent for this sort of comprehensive wealth tax in the US. Sweden eliminated theirs 20 years ago to avert capital flight and promote entrepreneurship and now has 50% more billionaires per capital than the US.”

Online conversation about Kauffman’s planned event has continued to alternate between incredulity and ridicule. “I can’t imagine billionaires marching in the street,” one social media user said, of the event.

Kauffman told TC that, so far, he isn’t aware of any actual billionaires planning to attend the march that has been organized in their honor. Kauffman said that the event is likely to include “a few dozen attendees,” although he stressed that he really isn’t clear on how many people would show up.

The ongoing outrage over the proposed tax is a little funny, given that it’s already been known for quite some time that the legislation has almost no chance of being enacted. That’s because California Governor Gavin Newsom has already stated that, should the bill somehow pass, he would veto it.

            <div id="article-text">This week, Donald Trump called for Republicans to “nationalize” the upcoming elections—even though state and local officials are charged with this role. Panelists on Washington Week With The Atlantic joined to discuss this and more.

When Trump came into his second term, he tried to “get rid of mail voting, he tried to change machine technology, he tried to impose voter ID—almost all of that has been thrown out by the courts,” Atlantic staff writer Michael Scherer said last night. “What we’ve seen in the last couple weeks, though, is something else: He’s using the full power of the federal government … to suck up information to try and confirm the debunked theories that he has about the 2020 elections.” The president, Scherer added, is acting “in the hope that he might find a spark in all the smoke that’s been created by his allies.”

Joining the editor in chief of The Atlantic, Jeffrey Goldberg, to discuss this and more: Jonathan Lemire, a staff writer at The Atlantic and a co-host of MSNBC’s Morning Joe; Jonathan Karl, the chief Washington correspondent for ABC News; Scherer, a staff writer at The Atlantic; Liz Landers, a White House correspondent at PBS News Hour.</div>

When Michael Pollan traveled to a cave in New Mexico to try to understand consciousness, he learned what good meditation is really made of. “The recipe was simpler (and much less appetizing) than I would have imagined,” he writes: “To transcend the self, force yourself to be alone with it long enough to get so bored and exhausted that you are happy to let it go.”

As Pollan intuits, this practice isn’t all that fun at first. But by the end, you get somewhere that makes it all worth it. Deep, existential thinking is a little like exercise, Arthur C. Brooks wrote in 2024: We might avoid contemplating big questions because of the short-term discomfort, but in doing so we ignore the bigger payoff. You can schedule deep thinking into your life in the same way you would a workout, Brooks argues: Take time out of the day to meditate and consider meaningful ideas, or go for a morning walk without your devices to spark contemplation. Today’s newsletter explores these and other ways of turning deep thought into a habit.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">My folks are visiting me in Southern California for a couple of months, so I rented them a house down the street. The place is new construction, modern and sleek. Rentals tend to be shabby and worn-out, so choosing a home with the latest and greatest felt like a way to make the experience hassle-free.

All of the appliances and systems are brand-new: the HVAC, the lighting, the entertainment. Touch screens of various shapes and sizes control this, that, and the other. Rows of programmable buttons sit where traditional light switches would normally be. The kitchen even has outlets designed to rise up from the countertop when you need them, and slide away when you don’t.

It’s all state-of-the-art. And it’s terrible.

Light switches, which have been self-explanatory since the dawn of electric lighting, apparently now come as an unlabeled multibutton panel that literally required a tutorial session from a technician. Pressing the same button twice might turn the lights on and off, or you might have to press one button for on and another for off. “It depends” is the name of the game—which is exactly what you don’t want when you’re trying to find the bathroom in the middle of the night.

Jacob Sweet: The microwave makes no sense

The TV is a recent model from Samsung. The picture is great, once it finally boots up—after you’ve spent way too long staring at a black screen wondering if you hit the power button or not, then hitting it again and realizing you just switched the whole thing off even though it never seemed to be on in the first place. And of course you can’t simply turn the TV on to find the last channel you were on; you have to navigate a menu of countless apps you probably don’t subscribe to. Watching TV feels more like a cognitive test than a way to relax.

The kitchen is also pointlessly complicated. My mom, the rental-company-supplied tech guy, and I stood around the Miele dishwasher, repeatedly bashing buttons just to get it to show signs of life. We checked the power to make sure it was plugged in. It was. More button pressing; still nothing. Finally, we noticed a QR code, along with a note encouraging us to register the appliance with an app. Wait—was that required to turn it on? The dishwasher had never been used before, which meant another call to the rental company to have them sort it out for us. The oven was equally perplexing. The controls are obtuse icons with no tactile feedback, hidden behind smoked black glass. I have a different brand at home, with its own black-glass display. After five years, I still have no idea what the chef’s-hat icon means.

On to the thermostats. When we got there, it was hot. But how hot, exactly? Round touch screens in various rooms took us through a labyrinth of tiny-text options just to set the temperature to 68 degrees. Or was it already at 68? We finally managed to select the temperature we wanted only to discover that a preset schedule overrode our choice, and we’d have to figure out how to override that.

The alarm system is operated in two places—from a device near the front door and another in the primary bedroom—by what are essentially iPads bolted to the wall. At my house, the alarm system has nine raised buttons on it for the code, and a couple more for common controls, such as dialing 911. Perfect. We have no idea how to operate these new screens. But they are screens, so they have to do something. Day and night, they show us the weather forecast.

Even getting inside the house is complicated. A digital lock on the front gate requires a four-digit PIN, but the PIN doesn’t work—the builders, it seems, never connected the lock to a power source. Instead, you’re supposed to enter the code into a different keypad panel that’s mounted to the wall next to the gate. Mercifully, you can ignore both the dead little computer bolted to the gate and the functioning one nearby it because the gate also comes equipped with a keyhole, and a key you can stick inside.

On top of all this tech floats a layer of lag. Flip an old-school light switch and the light comes on instantly. Tap an old-school remote and, after a blast of shimmering static, you’re watching TV. Press a button on these new systems and there’s a long pause before something happens—if anything happens at all.

I’m no Luddite. I run a software company! I see the allure of high-tech gadgets and have fallen for their promises before. When my wife and I built a house more than a decade ago, we opted for all kinds of automated systems: low-voltage controls, mechanized blinds, irrigation systems that measure rain so the sprinklers come on only when you need them. We regretted it almost immediately. What we discovered is that this stuff requires setup, which can take more time than just doing things manually, and is maddeningly glitchy, forcing you to pay someone handsomely by the visit or the hour to fix your appliances for you.

Tech makes many things better, but you shouldn’t have to learn how to use a house. You shouldn’t need a tech tour and an app (or five) to turn the heat down or clean the dishes. You shouldn’t have to worry that pressing the wrong button will set off a chain of events you don’t know how to undo. All these powerful processors and thousands of lines of code have succeeded in making everyday things slower, harder to use, and less reliable than they used to be.

Ellen Cushing: There are two types of dishwasher people

Maybe the technology is still in its primitive stage, some breakthrough will come, and tricked-out houses will soon work seamlessly, removing friction and frustration from everyday tasks. But I wouldn’t bet on it. A light switch used to have one job, and it either did it perfectly or it was very easy to find out why it didn’t. Today’s digital replacements are too sophisticated for their own good. They’re hard to integrate with one another and even harder to troubleshoot when they don’t work. Is it this thing? That thing? Both things? Something else entirely?

My wife and I are in the middle of another home renovation, and this time we’ve decided to go the good old analog route: switches you flip, dimmers you turn, and thermostats with a pin pointing at a number on a dial. That’s what I call progress.</div>

            <h2>Pete Davidson’s Charm Is Working Against Him</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-02-07</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/2026/02/pete-davidson-show-netflix-video-podcast/685920/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The first question to confront when considering The Pete Davidson Show, a new Netflix series that the streamer is calling a “video podcast,” is: What is a podcast? The term can be a little difficult to pin down; what initially referred to downloadable audio files you ported onto your iPod is today used for most online radio. Now the notion of a podcast is transforming again to include filmed entertainment. Bite-size clips of chat programs are flooding every social-media feed, in a desperate hunt for engagement. But I would argue that podcasts should always involve a dedicated feed you can listen to on your phone.

The Pete Davidson Show does not have that. Instead, the weekly program is available to consume only on Netflix, and only in video form. A cynic might wonder if branding The Pete Davidson Show a “podcast” is just a way for the streaming empire to avoid paying for the kind of unionized crews and production staff a talk show demands. Or perhaps, if I am being more charitable, Pete Davidson’s effort is considered a podcast because it’s imitating the stripped-down aesthetics of one. The host sits in a fairly bare garage, with a couple of paint cans stacked between two comfy armchairs. His first guest, the musician Machine Gun Kelly, doesn’t even have a place to put his coffee, so he sits it on the floor near his feet. Talk shows have bands and green rooms; podcasts are for raw, unfiltered chat, though preferably, for companies like Netflix, also between famous people.

So on that front, does The Pete Davidson Show deliver? There’s already a gigantic pile of celebrity talk programs in the podcasting space—many of them weak clones of other lo-fi interview podcasts, most obviously WTF With Marc Maron, which ended last year. Davidson, who has been in the public eye since joining the cast of Saturday Night Live at age 20, is the sort of highly scrutinized person viewers might want to learn more about. This is partly the allure of any public figure’s podcast: that you encounter them in a more candid mode.

But as a host, he is casual to a fault. He’s prone to slouching in his chair, ripping a thousand cigarettes, and reminiscing about various awkward interactions he and his guests have had at parties over the years. In the series premiere last week, Davidson and Kelly (who are good friends) hold court about, among other topics: Davidson’s fancy Japanese toilet; Kelly’s flight to the podcast taping, in upstate New York; acting together in The Dirt, the Mötley Crüe biopic; and generally weathering the slings and arrows of megastardom. There are interesting pockets of intimacy between the pair, as they discuss their mirrored battles with depression and addiction, and sweeter moments, like when they gush about their young daughters. But for being just 38 minutes long (which is pretty short by most podcasting standards), the episode feels unfocused at best.

Read: The Dirt celebrates the soullessness of Mötley Crüe

Davidson’s inexperience becomes obvious when seated across someone much better versed in the medium. Episode 2 features Charlamagne tha God, a seasoned radio personality, whose comfort and facility with the format forces Davidson to keep up. He trades quips with the comedian before eking out further insights: A string of jokes about the rapper turned actor Ice-T and his longtime wife, Coco, becomes a reflection on the role romantic partners can play in one’s career. As Davidson thanks his guest for stopping by, he also notes Charlamagne’s prowess: “This also made me appreciate how amazing you are at this job,” he says.

Maybe Davidson can grow into the gig; very few hit podcasts emerge from the gate fully formed. But The Pete Davidson Show is a particularly rough lump of clay. The garage setting riffs on Maron’s format, but the space is devoid of any notable physical objects for guests to bounce off—nothing like Maron’s frequently remarked-upon tchotchkes or guitars. Davidson’s chat with Kelly has no structure, no segments, and no particular gimmick; and while none of that is required of a podcast, some sense of organization can help shape an otherwise-unformed snippet of conversation. Most vital, Davidson doesn’t have much interest in learning more about Kelly, because he doesn’t need to—this is his good friend, with whom he already has a rich history that the viewer only gets glimpses of over the course of their chat.

The lax vibe stands in stark relief to that of most successful celebrity-chat podcasts. Maron, who launched WTF when his comedy career was on a downswing, as peers emerged and surpassed him in fame, took an almost antagonistic approach with guests: He’d try to puzzle out their insecurities and ambitions, then compare them against his own. For Conan O’Brien, an old hand whose podcast Conan O’Brien Needs a Friend is a big player in the field, witty banter and appropriately leading queries come naturally; O’Brien also has plenty of pals on, but has a knack for turning their back-and-forth into a deeper examination of their friendship. The latest hit example is Amy Poehler’s Good Hang, which collected the first-ever Golden Globe for Best Podcast this year. As a host, Poehler has demonstrated a surprising amount of savvy in how she runs her show, from booking guests to steering them toward a compelling conversation.

Read: The Golden Globes tried to have it both ways

I kept thinking about Poehler’s show (which is filmed but is also available on an audio feed) while watching Davidson’s attempt. Good Hang is similarly pitched as a casual, low-stakes hour or so of chitchat between two celebrities; Poehler, one of Davidson’s fellow SNL alums, has chummy banter with a well-known subject, a role that has been filled by such major names as Jennifer Lawrence, Gwyneth Paltrow, and Ina Garten. But Poehler opens every episode by secretly calling up a friend of her guest on FaceTime, setting the mood for what she and her audience might be intrigued to learn. She then peppers her interviewees with a good mix of serious and silly questions, keeping them just goofy and off-balance enough to maybe reveal some vulnerabilities.

Nothing is revolutionary about what Poehler is doing, but she’s doing it well—it’s why the anodyne-seeming Good Hang has risen above the many imitators, to the point where anecdotes from the episodes regularly make news. Davidson’s chat with Kelly, on the other hand, seemingly vanished without a trace after its Friday drop. Perhaps some of his future guests will come armed with hotter takes, or juicier gossip, to avail the show’s relaxed host in his smoky garage. Or perhaps Netflix’s video-only podcasting experiment will go the way of many other such clones in this medium, which never took on board the lesson that podcasts require more than two microphones and a garage to actually be interesting.</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Bushwhacking through a stand of stunted aspens above 10,000 feet in Utah’s Tushar mountain range, the mountain guide Trevor Katz held his Garmin to the sky and pointed it south. “We should just look for an opening,” he said, glancing over at his colleague, Bailey Pugh, from under a ball cap he’d cut into a visor.

He took a few steps steeply uphill, then down, careful not to slide on the scree. “It says it’s right below us, by probably 10 meters. Wait, five.”

Wading through walls of branches, he and Pugh circled, eyes trained on the ground. Then, there it was. Stuck in the dirt, the hexagonal silver node looked like a device an alien could have planted. Its small antenna and carrying strap sat above the earth. A sharp spike below anchored it into the slope. It would be a strange thing to stumble upon this so high in the mountains, surrounded only by what can survive at such an elevation.

This is just one of 200 nodes planted across the range in a tidy grid, each tracked with a GPS waypoint. Earlier, they had placed the nodes in the ground; now it was time to extract them. Pugh hoisted this one out of the ground and into her pack. Then it was back to bushwhacking.

“This is why they had to hire mountain guides,” Pugh told me, as we picked our steps carefully across boulders.

At the beginning of the summer, Katz and Pugh had received an email from the owner of a guiding company they’d worked for in the past: A client needed mountain-savvy day workers for a new project—any interest? The biggest hint they got about the purpose of the project was the field crew’s meeting place, the Deer Trail Mine, at the mountains’ eastern base. Each team was given a set of GPS waypoints and told to take a 20-pound node, about as big as a football, to each location, plant it in the ground, and mark its location. “It was really mysterious,” Levi Warr, another crew member, told me. But the pay was good—$500 a day, plus a per diem, as much as they’d usually earn for a few days of guiding—and the instructions were clear enough, so out they went.

Only as the summer went on did the crew come to understand, from chatting with the project geologists and fieldwork managers, what exactly they were doing: helping locate some of the nation’s most in-demand minable resources across a patchwork of public and private lands. Arranged in grids that connect to low-Earth-orbit satellites, the nodes are capable of collecting and sharing data used to create high-resolution maps of anomalies, miles underground, that might be gold, copper, nickel, lithium, or other minerals.

The nodes used in the project were first released three years ago by the Australian company Fleet Space Technologies, and although they’ve been adopted by mining giants internationally, how widely they’re being used in the United States is unclear. Compared with older and more invasive survey methods, this technology can be deployed with minimal impact. According to Fleet Space, it can be particularly useful for surveying areas where permits are required—for the Fishlake National Forest, for example, and the Bureau of Land Management territory enveloping the Tushar Mountains. If this quiet method of mineral exploration is successful, it will have threaded a loophole in the law governing public lands, helping open them for mining that much more quickly—and controversially. All it will take is a few hundred nodes, a clear view of the sky to connect to satellites, and a small team of people who know how to traverse rough terrain.

Historically, mining-exploration projects have depended on a giant boom. Drop hammers, trucks with vibrating baseplates, and dynamite blasts send seismic waves through the Earth’s subsurface to a grid of geophones. The waves’ travel times are translated into rough maps of mineralized zones. On U.S. public lands, taking even this first step toward a new mine means getting approval, whether from the Forest Service or the BLM, a process that can be stringent and slow, requiring data collection and environmental assessment.

Instead of shakes and booms, Fleet Space’s node system relies on the naturally occurring vibrations of the earth and the sound waves created by those walking upon it. These scraps of seismic data from everyday life are gathered by the nodes’ internal geophones. After collection, the data are processed into “ambient-noise tomography,” or ANT, surveys, which provide the highest level of detail of what is underground, compared with traditional methods. (Fleet Space did not respond to a request for comment.)

The American West has long led the country in producing gold, copper, coal, and silver, as well as rare, sought-after elements, such as beryllium, that can be used for aerospace and defense technologies. The unique geologic profiles here—the Colorado Plateau, the Basin and Range region, the Rocky Mountains—are side effects of ancient inland seas, volcanic history, and an active boundary between two tectonic plates. Billions of years of pressure, folding, and depositing created a region rich with minerals just close enough to the surface to mine.

In the 1860s, white settlers flocked to what would become Marysvale, where the Deer Trail Mine is now located, with high hopes to strike gold, silver, and copper. By the 1930s, though, most of the mines had closed: The shallower, more accessible resources had been tapped, and it was too expensive to keep trying to get rich.

Over the years, a series of companies have bought the Deer Trail Mine in failed attempts to revive it, Helen and Alan Johnson told me. They’re lifelong residents of Marysvale and former employees of the mine, and they agreed to meet me at a Mexican restaurant in Orem, Utah, to talk history. Most recently, in 2018, MAG Silver, a Canadian company, bought the mine. The new owners had started exploring national-forest land for silver, gold, and copper with more traditional methods before turning to the Fleet Space nodes for this summer’s surveys.

These minerals, plus others that Fleet Space nodes can help discover, including cobalt, nickel, and lithium, are all on the country’s list of critical minerals. Demand for these materials is growing exponentially: Together and separately, they are used in iPhones, photovoltaic panels, combat drones, and many other technologies now key to Americans’ quality of life or national security. Some materials, like diamonds, can be whipped up in labs, but these particular resources come only from the ground.

Now the right combination of technology and political timing could mean that whatever is still in Utah’s mountains and elsewhere could be within reach for those who want it. As tariffs have kicked in and America seeks to ease its reliance on China for refined metals and minerals, the Trump administration has turned its attention to opening up U.S. land for mining—even when that means that the companies doing the mining aren’t American ones.

To plant one of the ANT nodes, Trevor Katz told me while walking up a slope scattered with juniper trees, does not require much. Hike in with a pickax, dig a hole a few inches deep, and place the sharp end of the node into that hole, making sure the spike containing the geophone is completely covered. To extract it, just pull it out of the ground and hike it out.

He and Pugh did this over and over, often putting in a dozen miles a day, as the field crew placed and extracted 200 nodes four separate times, first for a regional survey that covered about 50 square miles across BLM territory, national forest, and land the mine already owns, then for three surveys, mostly on Forest Service land, that made a more detailed search for anomalies.

To regulate mining activities on public land, balancing its responsibility to both conserve the land and make it useful, the Forest Service is supposed to consider an activity’s “surface disturbance.” Exploration that’s unlikely to cause “significant” disturbance can go forward without the Forest Service’s involvement. This distinction has helped separate casual use of public lands—such as private citizens panning for gold, which anyone can do freely—from commercial activities.

The surveys conducted last summer for the Deer Trail Mine project didn’t have any permits associated with them. I filed a Freedom of Information Act request for documentation of the ANT surveys filed by or on behalf of any of the stakeholders involved in the project, including MAG Silver and the Deer Trail Mine; none were filed with the BLM or the U.S. Forest Service. The companies involved in the project either did not respond to requests for comment or declined to comment for this article. The Fishlake National Forest Ranger Station, which has long worked with Deer Trail Mine and is responsible for all permitting and communication regarding the company’s mining activities on Forest Service land, told me that any commercial exploration at all would be expected to be disclosed to the rangers but that the station had no knowledge of the ANT surveys.

A spokesperson for the Forest Service’s national press office told me, however, that this type of survey does not need a permit or even a formal notice of intent, which the agency uses to determine whether further oversight is needed. But the legal experts I asked about the ANT nodes told me that they fall into a gray area of the law.

The key term is “significant disturbance,” Elizabeth Craddock, a government-relations attorney and a partner at Holland & Knight in Washington, D.C., who specializes in natural resources, told me. But the regulation itself doesn’t define what significant means, she said, so what counts is up for interpretation. These commercial-exploration projects seem to have found a way to quietly bypass federal regulations that outline how and when approval is given before exploration begins on public lands.

If the Deer Trail Mine project goes back into operation, it will need permits. This past fall, it was acquired, as part of MAG Silver, by another Canadian company, Pan American Silver—which has not pursued any further work on the project so far. But any next steps toward reopening a mine here could go faster than ever too.

Last March, President Trump signed an executive order directing federal agencies to expedite mining projects and prioritize mining activities on public lands. The administration has also made changes, at least temporarily, to the National Environmental Policy Act review process to accelerate project approvals. Agencies are no longer required to analyze long-term environmental effects that are hard to trace back to the initial cause, which significantly reduces the scope of every project’s review.

Opening up new mining operations would be in keeping with the founding directive of the Forest Service, which mandates the balance of protecting resources and extracting them. Many mines give small, rural towns a needed economic boost too—in Marysvale, for instance, the median household income is $28,750 a year, and the unemployment rate is 63 percent.

Still, while he’s out retrieving the nodes that could make new mines a reality, Katz told me, he’s been “telling myself the little copes that everybody does”—that it’ll be a long time before this land is developed. Looking out over the windswept tops of Mount Holly and Delano Peak, into a valley meadow called Horse Heaven, and across the entire range, I imagined 800 empty holes where the nodes used to be. Katz had mentioned that the project’s marketing materials clearly said that all the holes would be filled in—perhaps a gesture toward a remediation plan for the survey’s relatively small impacts—but that he and other guides had not, in fact, filled them in. Those holes were nothing you’d see unless you were looking; it’s likely that the first hard autumn rain quietly washed them away. But if this particular combination of technology and policy does add up to more mining across the country, the result will be loud and obvious.</div>

It&#39;s heavier, more expensive, and has a lower power density than any Li batteries.  With lithium prices way down, sodium is no longer economically viable, at least for vehicles.  Sodium&#39;s place is in whole home power systems, particularly in regions with very cold weather, where weight is not an issue and the longer cycle life helps offset the greater costs.

If you&#39;re in a cold weather climate you&#39;re better off with an ICE or Hybrid vehicle.  You can always charge your hybrid from your home sodium reserve.

It literally says in the 3rd paragraph above:

&quot;It delivers 175 watt-hours per kilogram of energy density, which is lower than nickel-rich chemistries but roughly on par with lithium ion phosphate batteries... &quot;

LFP batteries for vehicle use are currently around 220Wh/kq, that&#39;s nearly a 25% power to weight difference.  Every extra kg you have to haul around consumes more power so you need more of a charge to get the same distance, not to mention the additional tire wear due to the vehicle being heavy.

I stand by my position - if you want to electrify your vehicle in the north, your best bet is a hybrid.

LFP batteries for vehicle use are currently around 220Wh/kq, that&#39;s nearly a 25% power to weight difference.Slightly more than.  220/175 = 1.257.  Sodium ion batteries would have 26% more mass per unit of energy.But it gets worse.  You&#39;re also consuming additional energy to drag around that extra mass.  About a quarter of the weight of a car comes from the battery, so by increasing the weight of the battery by 25.7% to get the same kWh capacity, the car probably weighs 6.4% more.A quarter of your extra power consumption from the larger battery is wasted, which means you need to increase the capacity by at least 4

Exactly.  But it definitely has a place in ground based power storage.  Homes with solar or large scale solar farms that need to cycle reliably every day.  The greater cycle reliability makes them very attractive for that.  Especially true in the north of course, but attractive anywhere really.

Now if all that hype surrounding the new solid state batteries turns out to be true, the entire industry is going to be overturned.

CATL&#39;s LFP batteries hit 205 Wh/kg in 2024, so &quot;roughly&quot; is doing a lot of lifting there. It&#39;s 17% heavier for equivalent capacity. And it&#39;s not just a little lower than nickel-rich chemistries, it&#39;s a bit more than half as much.

It&#39;s also not clear how valuable cold weather performance is, newer EVs use heat pumps instead of resistance heating, and share the cooling loops between the powertrain, battery, and cabin, so that the heat removed from the motors can heat the cabin and battery. They&#39;re going to nee

No, sodium is much cheaper than lithium in the form that is needed to make batteries; recent commodity prices for NaOH have been 10x to 20x cheaper than bulk LiOH, although this isn&#39;t all the cost. The technology development is now to a state where complete sodium batteries are cheaper the lithium ones and has been for a year or so, and the technology is improving fast.

You are correct that the energy density is indeed worse, but that gap has also been closing in recent years. Modern Na batteries have bet

Sodium USED to be cheaper... but the market is currently flooded with lithium which has completed eroded the economic advantage to sodium.

Take a look at the prices for consumer LFP right now - you can get 16kwh packs for under $2k.

Thousands of vehicles are running around with these batteries for +10 years.

But even getting LiFePo4 (already much safer than Li-Ion and LiPo), is difficult and I found only a 100Wh power-bank. Nothing I use, including laptop and phone, actually needs Li-Ion or LiPo energy densities. They are either excessive or significantly too low.

As such, while you sacrifice peak range, you get a more stable stable year-round range in environments prone to very cold weather.

As such, while you sacrifice peak range, you get a more stable stable year-round range in environments prone to very cold weather.Even in cold weather, it seems questionable.  I&#39;ve read that lithium ion batteries recover about 80% of the lost capacity when you bring them from -15C to 15C, not counting the energy wasted on heating the battery.  The sodium ion batteries supposedly keep up to 85% of their capacity at ridiculously cold temperatures, but as far as I know, they still have to be heated to provide normal current levels on output.  So maybe the sodium ion batteries lose 5% to 10% less range in the cold, but because they start

I&#39;ve read that lithium ion batteries recover about 80% of the lost capacity when you bring them from -15C to 15C, not counting the energy wasted on heating the battery.  The sodium ion batteries supposedly keep up to 85% of their capacity at ridiculously cold temperatures, but as far as I know, they still have to be heated to provide normal current levels on output.  So maybe the sodium ion batteries lose 5% to 10% less range in the cold, but because they start

In the summary, that&#39;s lithium iron phosphate, not lithium ion phosphate. I wish people would stop calling them that and instead call them lithium ferro-phosphate (from which comes the LFP acronym) because this is a mistake just waiting to happen.

There are ten links in this summary. What is the method by which you decide the first sentence of the third link is the one that makes you decide whether to keep reading or not?

It was the first one to provide a quick excuse to post a top level whine.

I assume. I haven&#39;t read any of them yet.

So it doesn&#39;t matter which link it is. But in this case,  like I said, the first sentence already made my head spin with warning signs, it doesn&#39;t bode well for the rest of the content. Such is life.

A couple years ago, I got a job interview at a big-name university and I had to decide whether to go undercover or not. On paper, I looked like a normal candidate. But on the internet, I was saying all sorts of wacko things, like how it’s cool to ditch scientific journals and just publish your papers as blog posts instead.

I buy books all the time that I don&#39;t end up reading.

It might surprise you, but that&#39;s a common thing. People get interested in books, but then don&#39;t make up time for reading. A long time ago as graduate student I did not have internet at home, I was purchasing *and* reading a book every week, whether an essay or a novel. Now I have internet and also a busy life, and I can&#39;t make up time for reading anymore. I probably could, but there so many other things I can push forward even on nights and week-ends: my main job, my side hustle, a hobby (e.g. street photo

When reading 11 books per year makes you a mega-reader and even 1 book a year makes you a moderate reader I think we can safely conclude that reading is dead.

Throughout the 80s and 90s I consistently read 1-2 books per week, and so did most of my friends. Granted most people read less but a book every few weeks was totally normal.

Nowadays I read maybe a quarter of the articles in 4 online newspapers every morning, listen to the odd audiobooks but otherwise it is all video. If I had the same access to video

According to Goodreads via my Kindle...I read 85,323 pages in 155 books in 2025, down from 104,792 pages in 236 books in 2024. I was mostly retired in 2024 taking care of my mother.I know I read more than a few physical books but I am too lazy to input them manually into Goodreads.

Did Goodreads/Kindle take into account the variable number of words on a &quot;page&quot; due to ebook formatting?

In print books, since mass market printing appeared, the number of words on a page is fairly well defined due to standard physical page sizes, typefaces, spacing and margins.
This makes it possible to have a reasonably objective definition of pages of content, modulo a small number of variations in book formats across publishers: So we all have a rough idea of how many words can be crammed into an avera

Good point. I usually read at 5 pt font which is smaller than the default but your point is very valid. I checked and GR doesn&#39;t track anything of real value beyond the number of pages in a printed volume, but many are e-books only so who knows...

Please share your secrests for (a) keeping the cost down, and (b) making time to read.

The best way to keep costs down (legally) is to make a list of your local second hand bookstores and visit them in person. They can be specialized, but depending on your interests this means you have to hunt for the most suitable one.

When you visit, do not be put off by the books being in used condition, and sometimes in rough shape. You want to read them (presumably), not collect them. Since these bookstores also accept to buy books, you can recoup a percentage of the cost late

...has been greatly exaggerated. (to paraphrase Mr. Twain)

Short attention span is a real thing.  It has effected me and many others of my age.  Personal computers, the internet, and mobile phones all came along during our lives.  When I was young there was no (publicly accessible) internet, a trip to the library was a rare event, and no one was going to waste good money buying a book for a child.  As I grew up and had my own means, books became plentiful in my life.  As a teen BBSs came about. Downloads took FOREVER for even something simple. ... Now everything is available online instantly.  Information and entertainment in short, easy, bites.  I certainly feel the urge to switch topics as soon as something becomes &quot;boring&quot;, to sample and move on.

But... people still read.  The more educated people read a lot as they grew up and throughout their studies, and it is a habit they have maintained.  Those who struggled thru high school barely read then, and don&#39;t read now.  The children who grew up with phones and tablets in hand, they DEMAND that their parents buy them real physical books.  There are definitely generations in the middle who just don&#39;t read -anything.  They proudly announce that they have never read an entire book in their lives.  But, fortunately, they are not everyone.  Reading is a habit for some, and not for others.

Like the &quot;slight decrease in the percentage of U.S. adults who read any book in 2022 (49%) compared to 2012 (55%)&quot;, which is a decline of more than 10% in 10 years? I wouldn&#39;t call that a &quot;slight&quot; decrease in any meaning of the word.

Also, as others already noted, when reading 11 books per year is supposed to constitute a &quot;mega-reader&quot; then this very much looks like someone purposefully belittling the problem.

I don&#39;t even know where I could even get a hardcopy version of Moses T. Runnels&#39; two-volume History of Sanbornton, New Hampshire, totaling around 1,700 pages or so and published in 1882.  But I frequently consult the PDF version I downloaded from one of the numerous web sites that has it available.  Then there&#39;s my OverDrive Libby account, which gives me access to the holdings of something like eight library networks covering virtually all of a state, plus a university library or two.  I voraciously consume

I read more but w than I have in my past 50-some years. The difference for me was an electronic device, and a well known one you’ve certainly heard of, and some of you probably hate. It’s so easy to have a dozen or more books with me, they don’t weigh a ton, and I don’t need to worry about needing light to read by. I read an average of 20-25 books per year now. It’s replaced a fair bit of tv/movies/gaming for me.

It makes a lot of sense. Cars do 99% of the work themselves, you only need a small number of drivers, and they can be anywhere in the world.

Indeed. This is really all as expected. It also is in no way the problem it gets presented as.

But the clueless will be constantly amazed when they occasionally find out by accident how things actually work. And most people are clueless.

Amazon Go stores employed hundreds of low-paid Indian workers in offshore sweatshops [businessinsider.com] while pretending their AI was magically determining everything people put into their baskets and carts.

And now, we see Waymo is doing basically the same thing. While the congress-critters were focusing on the off-shoring aspect, I wish they&#39;d asked exactly how many times per trip the Waymo AI &quot;asked&quot; the humans for assistance - that could&#39;ve been enlightening.

When I tried it out with my girlfriend we used the same cart. It took half a day to get our invoices. There was never any doubt about who took what off the shelf. We didn&#39;t do anything cute like put stuff back on the shelf or try to hide what we are doing. No computer works that slow, so clearly the reason it took so long was the process was being done by people and we made it hard by having two people share a cart.

I went back later and they had normal checkers at the exit and eventually Amazon killed the w

To be fair, babies don&#39;t really drive a lot of motorcycles.

America requires babies to wear helmets when driving motorcycles?

I&#39;d have expected American motorcycle babies to be maximising their legal disruptiveness by being required to shoot passers-by. Why not - they&#39;re under the age of legal responsibility. Until it comes to the consequences of violating their NDA.

Foreign pilots do fly in US airspace, however it&#39;s way more difficult to get a pilots license around the world than a drivers license is.

If a remote worker operates a vahicle in the US, do they need a valid US driving licence do be legally allowed to do it?

Not sure that the question of ongoing operation on US roads by someone who remains subject to a different state&#39;s licensing requirements has been addressed; since historically it would have been purely hypothetical.The situation you describe here is actually quite common. From the Texas Department of Public Safety [texas.gov]:Driving privilege reciprocity allows a person to use a valid, unexpired foreign license to operate a motor vehicle in Texas for up to one year or until a person becomes a Texas resident, whichever date is sooner.I&#39;ve encountered similar wording in every US state I&#39;ve been in.

But in any case, I think they&#39;re precisely trying to maneuver themselves out of this situation altogether. Quoting from the article:“They provide guidance. They do not remotely drive the vehicles,” Peña told the Senate committee.&quot;Providing guidance&quot; ... Slick. Let&#39;s see how that goes.

&quot;Providing guidance&quot; ... Slick. Let&#39;s see how that goes.

But the US in contrast to the Philippines did not sign the Vienna Convention on Road Traffic signatory. The signs in the US are completely different from the ones I had to learn for my EU driving license. And as far as I know, there are even some rules that differ from US state to US state, e.g. turning right on a red traffic light. I would not dare to claim that I know the US rules better than a Waymo car.

I&#39;m removing the app, I don&#39;t want to support any American company that off shores critical support like this.

Science is all about making hypotheses and testing them.  Mistakes happen all the time.  It&#39;s part of good science.

No,  no the experts didn&#39;t get it wrong.  The low information reactionaries got it wrong.  To them there is one kind of bee and any bee is that kind of bee.

The article references non-experts who gave well intentioned bad advice and quotes experts who gave the more accurate better advice.  It&#39;s been pretty well known to anybody who actually paid non-superficial attention to the issue that it was native bees that were under threat.

The &#39;experts&#39; got it all wrong again.To be fair, I don&#39;t ever recall this issue being about protecting native bee biodiversity.  It was always presented as &quot;without bees to pollinate, you can kiss all these food crops goodbye!&quot;  As in, the threat had always been directed towards the agricultural industry (and by extension, anyone who liked eating foods that might go off the menu if the honeybees went *poof*).

Or looked at another way, there is no winning w/ this crowd.  First they&#39;ll bitch that honeybees are going extinct, and after they are saved, they &quot;find&quot; out that we saved the &quot;wrong&quot; type of bees

Honestly, I don&#39;t care which bees survive, as long as the flowers get pollinated

The trick is that keeping honeybees can bring in dollars. That&#39;s why honeybees were &quot;saved&quot;. Your single hive in the back of your yard isn&#39;t a problem, the industry that transports hives all over the country is.

Of what financial value are &quot;The bumblebees, sweat bees, mason bees, miner bees, leafcutters and other native bees&quot;? Yeah, the same as clean water and air.

But Jason Statham doesn&#39;t do documentaries.

Native bees are critical for the rest of the fucking planet.

And they&#39;re actually not critical for many crops, tho helpful for larger yields. We already grow way more food than the human population can possibly consume. Distribution and affordability is more often the problem.

And don&#39;t get me started on how much is grown and effectively wasted on livestock.

The very definition of insanity.  Doing the same thing over and over, and still get the same, shitty results.

So by &quot;honeybees&quot; do we mean, like, actual honeybees, you know, the black and yellow bugs that fly around. Or is &quot;honeybees&quot; a code word for something majorly messed up, kind of like it turns out that the word &quot;pizza&quot; is code for something disturbing. Just asking, because 2026 is, um, you know.

The doubts will last for as long as the depression, during which the wealthy will be buying up bitcoin like mad. Once Bitcoin heads back into the 100k region, everyone will decide it IS digital gold, and push it up higher, at which point the wealthy will sell off, causing a collapse that the &quot;everyone elsers&quot; essentially pay for, and the cycle will continue.

And that is all bitcoin is. It&#39;s all the stock market is, too. A tool for pumping money from 401K plans and the gambling poor into the hands of the wealthy.

Yep. And different from penny-stocks or other crappy investments, you will not ever be able to sell them, because the Bitcoin network will simply vanish when mining does not pay anymore.

It&#39;s still marginally profitable if you are stealing electricity.

Interesting. That effect may be the end of it.

I wish it would just end.

I do not think that will work. Because who would make that decision and implement it? It will just be the start of open &quot;value&quot; manipulation.

And that is all bitcoin is. It&#39;s all the stock market is, too.You&#39;re completely wrong to equate bitcoin with the stock market.  When you buy shares in a publicly-traded company you&#39;re buying something real, a portion of an actual business that owns real stuff, has real employees, makes real stuff and sells it to real people.  Exactly how much that company is worth, so exactly how much your share is worth, isn&#39;t really clear because calculating that value requires a lot of guesses about what the company, and its market, and the economy as a whole, are going to do in the future.  But it&#39;s definitely worth *something*.

That&#39;s not true of bitcoin.  You won&#39;t hear people talking about bitcoin &quot;fundamentals&quot; the way they do with stocks, because bitcoin doesn&#39;t have any fundamentals.  It&#39;s just vibes, all the way down.  Oh you can talk about hashrates and work factors and the cost of mining equipment, etc., but none of that has any actual value.  If the governments of the world united and successfully banned cryptocurrencies, all those ASIC rigs would be useless.  If they were still using GPUs at least you could repurpose them for AI, or graphics.

We should clarify that although stocks often follow &quot;fundamentals&quot; in the long run, it&#39;s a very fuzzy thing.  First, there&#39;s no agreement on what the fundamentals entail.  Is that revenue, profit, margins, PE ratio, either trailing or some estimate of future?  Second, high-frequency traders account for around half of all stock transactions, and they directly ignore all fundamentals all the time.  Third, retail investors (like you and me) account for up to 20% of all trades, but not surprisingly, these investors may not understand what fundamentals are.  Fourth, about a quarter of all trades are made by hedge funds that do a lot of shorting and use of derivatives, which greatly muddies up all the talk about fundamentals.

Despite all this fuzziness, stocks are still much easier to understand than crypto, which is pure speculation with no inherent value.

I have made quite a lot of money investing in the stock market, and you can too.  People who know what they are doing gain the option to retire early.

You don&#39;t do it by day-trading or other stupid things.  One makes money in the stock market through wise, tried-and-true buy-and hold strategies.  It takes many years for the profits to amount to much.  That is more than most people can bear.  Everyone wants to be an overnight millionaire.  Nope, that&#39;s not going to happen on the stock market.

It&#39;s debatable whether HFT is a net positive for the market (it does provide positive value, ensuring that pricing is consistent across markets), but it definitely doesn&#39;t &quot;rig&quot; the market.  If you&#39;re trying to compete with the high frequency traders at their game, you&#39;re going to lose, but you&#39;re also doing it wrong. For people who don&#39;t spend all their time reading quarterly reports, the right way to do it is to put your money in a decent mutual fund or index fund, and let it grow.  If you want

It’’s fundamentally different from the stock market. The stock market is about ownership of a productive asset, a company. Bitcoin produces nothing. It’s a nominal store of value, like gold, but completely intangible. It’s worth exactly the faith that people have in it, no more or less. There is no liquidation value as there is for a stock. You are not left with something in your hand, as you are with gold.

In short, it’s bullshit. It’s always been bullshit. I’ll nev

The wealthy are buying good, not Bitcoin. The challenge with Bitcoin now is that it has effectively become regulated via tax and anti money laundering agreements across most countries.

It&#39;s as if &quot;the wealthy&quot; somehow know that buying things when they&#39;re cheap and selling them when they&#39;re expensive is a good way to make money.

Last time Dontardo passed a big trickle down scam bit coin crashed down to the price to generate a coin. This time it&#39;s a repeat but the cost is higher. What is it now $40k? (depends on cheap power) We probably have a ways longer to drop.   Last time it made more sense to invest in higher return &quot;investments&quot; because of the trickle down scam and it is the same now.

I do think it will rise up again later on like last time.

Also try to pay attention when Putin goes in big; likely after the USA goes in and then

Fear and greed drive bitcoin. No inherent value.

You left out ignorance and stupidity. Without that, it would never have gotten to anything.

Well, yes but the supply of human stupidity is really big and it&#39;s also a renewable resource. There is literally a new sucker born every day. Actually the AI says at least 360 thousand new suckers each day.

I have a new formulation of the problem. Previous changes have created many problems. Some of those problems are becoming existential and we need solutions. But the solutions involve more changes, and the people with the power to decide on and implement changes are not thinking about solving old problems.

Indeed. Although I tend to think the world is not actually so connected that it all has to implode together. Some parts may still be able to survive the crash of the rest. That a really big implosion is coming seems to be rather obvious though.

Bitcoin seems to have this odd 4 year cycle where it skyrockets to more than double it&#39;s prior all time high, only to crash over 50% in value 6 months later.

It went from around 20,000 back to 3,000 around 2018, and from $62,000 back to $16,000 around 2022. This time in 2025-2026 it drops from $120,000 to... $55,000? I&#39;m not sure where the bottom is, but I don&#39;t think that we hit it yet.

Each dip seems to be a bit less crazy than the last one, but it&#39;s definitely either a &quot;cyclical asset&quot; if you&#39;re a Bitcoin believer or a giant &quot;pump and dump scam&quot; if you&#39;re a Bitcoin hater.

And if you are neither &quot;believer&quot; nor a &quot;hater&quot;, but see it as what it is with, you know, using rational though instead of emotions, there are no &quot;cycles&quot; here, as it is all even less valuable than hot air.

You people are even more disconnected from reality than the AI fanbois. And that is saying something.

&quot;You people&quot; is for sure one of the best ways to start out a line of &quot;rational [thought]&quot;.

I confess, I believe in the AI as well, love it, want more of it...but it does not provide any arguments to prove my statements false.Why not? Because you know I am right, otherwise you would type something proving me wrong.

Whether you like it or not people buy and sell control of Bitcoin, and there is an obvious cycle.Why deny it because you think it is irrational or emotion to &quot;believe&quot; in or &quot;trade&quot; Bitcoin?For bett

I agree, the &quot;halving&quot; charts seemed to correlate with this four year pattern.But the charts do not show a drop right after the reward to mine a block is cut in half as I would expect.Those who pushed the &quot;halving&quot; correlation are probably comfortably hibernating for another year of crypto winter before the spring.

If I had any money I would put it where my mouth is an buy me some Bitcoin...but all I can do is put my prediction here in writing: the bottom is no lower than $60k, and 3 years from now $120K min

I wonder if it is related to the uncertainties that come with the mid-term elections. Almost every one so far since 2006 [exception: 2014] has seen the House flip which invites a whole new relationship with the President (usually antagonistic) and with it a huge increase in uncertainties that tend to drop a lot of markets for a time. So maybe they&#39;re selling to ride it out in more stable things (like international stocks and, well, you&#39;ve likely noted the price of gold is exploding...)

Interesting.Peak in late 2013 ($1000) dropping to a low mid 2015 ($225).Peak in late 2017 ($20k) dropping to a low late 2018 ($4k).Peak in late 2021 ($65k) dropping to a low late 2022 ($15k).Peak in late 2205 ($120k) dropping to a low maybe in late 2026 here of like ($50k).Midterms: 2026, 2022, 2018, 2014 all correlate with the low? I think that is a sound assertion!

Okay, but your pattern of the House flipping seems pretty sound, some might say certain, going back 20 years now.In addition I would have figur

My guess of how the dominoes fell as worldwide BTC dropped from $80K -> $65K--

1) Bithumb, a South Korean company, screwed up by sending BTC instead of won to its accounts
  https://feed.bithumb.com/notic... [bithumb.com] 2) its users quickly sold 1,788 BTCs, which pushed the Korean bitcoin index down below $60K3) IBIT then plummeted from the national selling4) Blackrock had hedged IBIT
https://bitrss.com/bitcoin-cra... [bitrss.com] 5) worldwide BTC dropped from Blackrock&#39;s loss

The belief that BTC has value is a pure hallucination. Also, the fewer people that fall for the scam, the more volatile things get. It seems the scam is slowly coming to an end. About time.

Yeah, but the whole &quot;$200,000 Monkey JPEG&quot; thing was the high point of the last 2021-2022 crypto rally.

This last rally seemed to be more of a &quot;We can put Bitcoin ETF&#39;s in our IRA now, and we just got a crypto friendly president in office! Buy Buy Buy!&quot; sort of thing.

It&#39;s been what, over 10 years now of Bitcoin and crypto and what has been the net utility to society or even humanity? I would say outside of a few select people getting wealthy it has overall been a net negative for 99% of humans alive.

It eats electricity, it eats labor which could be used on more useful things (how many talented coders are in crypto shit?) it eats money, it eats investments which could otherwise go into new companies or other ventures, it&#39;s just a big fat distraction for everyone, the fact we are talking about it here is even a net negative.

Now how you &quot;ban&quot; it is a tricky thing but at least as far as I am concerned I would say the SEC or whomever should declare it illegal to exchange any crypto for USD.  Would that create a black market? Sure but that already exists, at least lets acknowledge that&#39;s all it is an ever was.

We&#39;ve held our tongues and played nice for far too long than anyone involved in the crypto space deserves, it&#39;s stupid, it&#39;s a waste it adds almost nothing, probably worse than nothing, it has made all our lives worse.

The interesting issue here is that Bitcoin is a fiat currency, but it is backed by nothing. It&#39;s not that other currencies are not fiat currencies, but they are backed by something.

The US dollar is &quot;backed&quot; in the sense that if it crashes, the USA will do &quot;something&quot; to relieve the crash, and it&#39;s currently a currency that is needed to buy oil worldwide, and it&#39;s currently accepted as a  &quot;reserve currency&quot;. Could all of this change and the US dollar become worthless? Yes, of course but that would not happen until the US economy is completely destroyed. Most people would consider that unlikely, so they accept the fiat US dollar as a stable investment.

I suspect Bitcoin survived this long since it developed a little bit of real-world usefulness as a tool for moving and laundering criminal proceeds. As law enforcement gets better at attacking that criminal revenue chain, that usefulness is going to fade.

In a sense, the fact Bitcoin is a fiat currency backed by nothing is part of its allure: That makes it volatile. That makes it really attractive to gamblers or the professional gamblers who take big risks and call themselves &quot;investors&quot;

But eventually there will be a run on Bitcoin, just as there always is with any bubble. Perhaps this is just a big run. And there will continue to be runs as long as Bitcoin exists.

it&#39;s currently a currency that is needed to buy oil worldwide

Oil is priced in dollars by convention, but there is no requirement to buy it using dollars outside of what individual countries require for their trade. Oil is regularly traded in other currencies including euros, Indian rupees, Chinese yuan, and Russian rubles, with non-dollar oil trading covering about 20% of the global market. The US dollar is relatively stable, though, so it serves as a useful reference for other currencies, and using it dire

You are onto something there. el Bunko usually destroys everything he touches: his &quot;companies&quot;, the Kennedy Center, U.S. democracy, law and order, etc. This is just another in his unbroken line of failures.

His cryptocoin is down 93%. But it was just another way to funnel money into his pockets anyway.

did they come to him with tears on their eyes?

Bitcoin only got to rise in price because it was the first and for some time the only digital wallet. People, particularly tax evaders and money launderers, liked the idea of moving millions in a USB stick.or a mail. That created demand, demand bid the price up, and prices up brought the momentum-seeker speculators. Virtuous circle for you.

That era is gone. There are many digital options now. Particularly you have stablecoins where you don&#39;t need to worry (so much) about them losing value. So only the specu

And that it&#39;s a scam, and that one insane dude controls way too much of the money supply, and that it&#39;s harder to make money at it now, the pushback against bitcoin mining in general, and that itls literally designed to have a finite life because its sole purpose is to troll technolibertarians that have a marvelous misunderstanding of how reality actually works.

Bitcoin advocates used to claim that the reason Bitcoin was shooting up in value wasn&#39;t that it was a made up currency subject to massive swings in value, but because the dollar was undergoing massive inflation and Bitcoin was the one actually holding its value.

They claimed this when USD inflation was actually around the usual 2-3% it normally is.

And for the last few years we&#39;ve seen inflation bordering hyperinflation for the USD. But somehow... Bitcoin has lost value, not gained it.

inflation bordering hyperinflation for the USD

Lol. Pray you never experience what hyperinflation actually is.

It has been pumped and dumped for years now.. the whales are gladly riding the waves and the news media got something to report and discuss. All the fat cats win!

it was never worth the money in the first place.

&quot;No, but seriously: What&#39;s going on with bitcoin?&quot;

Lol, no one knows. No one has a clue, even the people manipulating it behind the scenes don&#39;t really know what&#39;s going on. It&#39;s out of their hands. It&#39;s taken on a life of its own, if you will, and now it&#39;s running amok.

They&#39;re desperately trying to figure out how to stabilize it but that&#39;s like trying to steer clouds with your leaf blower.

All they can do is panic quietly and hope they don&#39;t wake up tomorrow morning with bitcoin trading for the same price a

            <div id="article-text">Sign up for the Surge, the newsletter that covers most important political nonsense of the week, delivered to your inbox every Saturday.

Welcome to this week’s edition of the Surge, which once again has had the NFL reject its pitch to perform a live reading of this newsletter as the Super Bowl halftime show.

The United States, and its news, failed to improve this week. Congress did fund the government but is already stuck ahead of the next spending deadline. Tulsi Gabbard remains at large. And while it’s not entirely about politics—though it’s not not about politics—we couldn’t resist a few words about the gutting of the local newspaper.

Blah, blah, life is sad—well, not anymore, because we’re kicking off 2026 primary season with Texas Week! Everybody grab two handfuls of sizzlin’ Texas chili (??) and git to reading.

We are less than a month from the start of 2026 primary season, as Texas voters go to the polls on March 3. This is welcome news to the Surge. Early primary coverage feels so distant with its talk of endorsements, “war chests,” and other lifeless stats. Now we can cover proper knife fights down the stretch.

The prime drama of the week came in Texas’ competitive Senate Democratic primary between state Rep. James Talarico and U.S. Rep. Jasmine Crockett, of Dallas. It started when Morgan Thompson, a Texas TikTok personality, said that Talarico had told her privately “that he signed up to run against a mediocre Black man, not a formidable and intelligent Black woman.” The Black man in question is former Rep. Colin Allred, who ended his Senate campaign last year and switched to a House race. Allred then posted his own video response in which he endorsed Crockett and trashed Talarico, telling him, “If you want to compliment a Black woman, just do it. Just do it. Don’t do it while also tearing down a Black man.” For his part, Talarico said Thompson had offered a “mischaracterization” of his remark, and that he described only Allred’s “method of campaigning as mediocre.” (Not a particularly controversial observation there.)

National Republicans, who would prefer to run against the more polarizing, partisan figure in Crockett, have greatly enjoyed this all. It’s been a welcome distraction from their own Texas problems.

Our view of the Texas Senate race has been that it gets way too much attention for a contest that Republicans are probably going to win by 5 to 7 points. It’s not among the top pickup opportunities that national Democrats are targeting. Democrats haven’t won statewide there since 1994, and they seriously backslid in the state in 2024. It’s expensive to run in. There’s always a lot of temptation, every cycle, for Democrats to believe that this time could be different. It never materializes.

All of which is to say: It’s temptation time again! The national atmosphere is lousy for Republicans, the gains they made among Hispanic voters in 2024 to fortify their Texas standing are evaporating, Texas Republicans just got dusted in a special election in what they thought was a safe-red district, and, most importantly, they have candidate problems of their own. Incumbent Sen. John Cornyn, who would likely win reelection to his seat if he made it to November’s general, is in dreadful primary shape. After $50 million in advertising has been spent on his behalf, it’s still not clear that he’d make it to a runoff in his primary against Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton and Rep. Wesley Hunt. Even if he did make the runoff against Paxton, he’d likely be at a disadvantage. If Paxton, another partisan, polarizing figure laden with personal and professional baggage, becomes Republicans’ nominee, Democrats will feel the Texas temptation like never before.

We regret to say that at the rate she’s going, Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard is at risk of replacing Lindsey Graham as the Surge’s go-to “Here’s what they were up to this week” entry. Not a good sign for America. We’ve learned of late that Gabbard, who had been out of the public eye for a while, has been running her own investigation into the results of the 2020 election and sniffing around old ballots and voting machines. She was on the scene at an FBI raid of a Fulton County, Georgia, election center last week and, as we learned a few days ago, apparently called the president from Atlanta and put him on speakerphone with the agents who conducted the raid. None of this is within the DNI’s purview, all of it is wildly inappropriate at best, any of it would be a major scandal that Congress oversees immediately in a functioning government.

There is more. The Wall Street Journal reported this week that there’s a whistleblower complaint about Gabbard “that is so highly classified it has sparked months of wrangling over how to share it with Congress,” and that it’s “said to be locked in a safe.” A redacted version of the complaint, then, was finally made available to a select group of lawmakers later in the week, with executive privilege claims getting in the way of the good stuff. We shall see. Elsewhere in Gabland: It was reported that Gabbard “obtained” voting machines from Puerto Rico to play around with them and look for security vulnerabilities. OK!

The Washington Post eliminated about a third of its staff and hundreds of journalism jobs this week in the worst single-day massacre of expertise and talent we’ve ever seen—even in an industry that’s been contracting all century. The Post nixed its sports and books coverage, axed much of its arts coverage, and gutted its international and metro desks. It is now narrowly focused on District of Columbia news and politics, making it less a swaggering international newspaper than a publication whose purview matches Politico’s.

The Post has gone through highs and lows going back decades. Yet the acute mismanagement of the past couple of years by its owner, Jeff Bezos, after he’d lost any apparent interest in owning a newspaper, is staggering. Seeking to protect his business before the government ahead of a potential Trump win in 2024, Bezos barred the editorial board from making an endorsement in the presidential race, costing the paper hundreds of thousands of subscribers.

Individual mega-billionaires are under no obligation to use their largesse to subsidize public institutions like the Post forever. (A gentleman, though, might backfill at least the hole he personally created by interfering with the editorial board.) They’re not obligated to do so when it collides with their other business interests. We do think they’re obligated, however, to find someone who is willing to carry the task forward. Rather than destroy a public institution because it’s become a hassle in various ways, sell it to someone who gives a shit.

Senate Democrats got what they wanted in the government funding battle that ensued following the killing of Alex Pretti in Minneapolis. Rather than extend funding for the Department of Homeland Security through September, it would be extended for two weeks while Democrats and Republicans negotiated some new restraints over immigration enforcement. The Senate passed this rejiggered deal late last week, and the House muscled it through on Tuesday.

It is now Saturday, and the sum total of negotiating progress that has been made is nothing. Democratic congressional leaders Chuck Schumer and Hakeem Jeffries put out a list of 10 demands—among them no masks for DHS officers, no roving DHS patrols, no racial profiling—which was met coolly by Republicans. “Democrats’ newest proposal is a ridiculous Christmas list of demands for the press,” Alabama’s Katie Britt, Senate Republicans’ lead DHS appropriator, said. “They continue to play politics to their radical base at the expense of the safety of Americans.” Democrats, meanwhile, say they are being serious—and it’s the Republicans who aren’t! Et cetera, et cetera, and so on and so forth. The conversation has moved largely toward what the next short-term DHS funding patch will look like, because a bigger deal to rein in immigration authorities does not appear to be in the ballpark of imminent.

A marked push from the most conservative factions in the House and Senate to pass a major voter verification and ID bill has kicked off, but it’s hitting the same old wall: the Senate filibuster. The bill in question was, at first, the SAVE Act, legislation that would require showing “documentary proof of United States Citizenship” in order to register to vote. Now there’s a new version—the SAVE America Act—that tacks on a requirement for presenting photo ID at polling places. Senate Democrats are fully hostile to the legislation, with Schumer calling it “Jim Crow 2.0” and saying it’s about “federalizing voter suppression.”

In order to appease certain House conservatives who were threatening to hold up the government funding bill this week, Senate Majority Leader John Thune said he would at least have a conversation with his senators about how to proceed on the SAVE Act and its successors. One idea that’s come up, as it often does during desperate times, is to force the minority to stage a “talking filibuster” to stall it, and wait for them to exhaust their parliamentary options. Those never happen, and for good reason: It could eat up weeks or months of valuable Senate floor time and force Senate Republicans to be on or near the Senate floor for most of that time. This is one of those discussions we’d expect to naturally dissipate on its own once it becomes clear how unpalatable all of the options are. But depending on how involved Trump gets, Thune could have to withstand a lot of pressure.

The U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia finally said something cool this week, then got in trouble for it. “You bring a gun into the District, you mark my words, you’re going to jail,” Jeanine Pirro said in an appearance on her old stomping grounds at Fox News. “I don’t care if you have a license in another district, and I don’t care if you’re a law-abiding gun owner somewhere else.” This didn’t sit well with gun-rights groups, who were already displeased with the administration for the way it talked about how Alex Pretti, who was carrying lawfully, shouldn’t have brought his gun with him to protest immigration officers in Minnesota. Elected Republicans, too, criticized her, with Florida Rep. Greg Steube, for example, telling Pirro, “Come and Take it!”

As Steube said in his own post, though, he’s licensed in both Florida and D.C. to carry. No one, regrettably, is going to take away Greg Steube’s gun. “Let me be clear: I am a proud supporter of the Second Amendment,” Pirro said in a follow-up social media post. “Washington, D.C. law requires handguns be licensed in the District with the Metropolitan Police Department to be carried into our community. We are focused on individuals who are unlawfully carrying guns and will continue building on that momentum to keep our communities safe.” That’s just a simple explanation of D.C. law that it’s her job to enforce. So she’ll probably have to keep apologizing.

He is chair of Elias Law Group and founder of Democracy Docket.

In the past few weeks, Donald Trump’s election denialism has kicked into high gear, just as his poll numbers hit new lows. Elias tells us the FBI/DNI raid to seize ballots in Fulton County, Georgia, and Steve Bannon’s new threats to surround polling places with ICE officers in November, show an administration that is prototyping new mechanisms for election subversion and voter suppression. But the public has power in this scenario, especially if they start paying attention to elections and voting rights now, rather than the day before Nov. 3, 2026.

It’s been a bad habit for a long time, but it’s getting worse: President Donald Trump can’t utter a single statement without lying about his accomplishments or revealing, all too plainly, that self-glorification is what he cares about the most.

Take his post on social media Thursday, affirming—as was clear a few days earlier—that he was going to let New START, the last remaining nuclear arms control treaty between the United States and Russia, expire this week with barely a shrug.

He wrote: “Rather than extend ‘NEW START’ (a badly negotiated deal … that, aside from everything else, is being grossly violated), we should have our Nuclear Experts work on a new, improved, and modernized Treaty that can last long into the future.”

First, though the treaty—which was signed in 2011—no longer addresses all the salient issues of today’s nuclear landscape, it was in fact a brilliantly negotiated accord in its day, mandating the deepest cuts and tightest on-site-inspection clauses in arms-control history.

The real problem with New START, in Trump’s eyes, was the same problem that compelled him to denounce the Iran nuclear deal as “the worst deal ever” before he tore it up in 2018; he hates them because they were both signed by his loathed and envied predecessor, Barack Obama.

Russian President Vladimir Putin—who has, in fact, abided by New START’s numerical limits—proposed that he and Trump extend the accord by one year, but Trump declined. (The treaty allowed for a one-time five-year extension, which Putin and Joe Biden signed back in 2021, perhaps another reason—since he loathes Biden at least as much as he despises  Obama—Trump would rather scuttle the whole deal.)

Then, in this same social media post, for no reason at all (this is the bad habit that I cited at the start of this essay), Trump recites some fibs. For instance: “I completely rebuilt [our] Military in my First Term, including new and many refurbished nuclear weapons.”

This is untrue. Obama approved the development of new nuclear weapons for the entire “strategic Triad”: land-based intercontinental ballistic missiles, submarine-launched ballistic missiles, and bombers, as well as new warheads and cruise missiles. (Ironically, he agreed to this as a way of getting Senate hawks to ratify the New START treaty. He was also snookered into this compromise. He agreed to “replace or modernize” the existing arsenal, thinking “modernize” could mean, for instance, upgrading the software on a guidance system. The senators took the term to be synonymous with “replace.”)

During his first term, Trump didn’t add a single new nuclear weapon or accelerate the ones that Obama put in motion. In fact, the first model of the new B-21 bomber took its first flight  during Biden’s presidency.

Trump’s social media post goes on: “I … continue to rebuild our Military at levels never seen before.”

This is palpably untrue. The Pentagon is, by some measures, spending more money than almost ever before, but building—of ships, planes, missiles, or whatever—is not growing so much; it’s dwarfed by the rearmament during World War II or the presidencies of John F. Kennedy and Ronald Reagan.

He rambles on: “We are even adding Battleships, which are 100 times more powerful than the ones that roamed the Seas during World War II.”

This is Trump’s big fantasy, stemming from romanticized memories of watching Victory at Sea, the WWII documentary on TV. But no naval officer wants to revive such relics, and it’s extremely unlikely the gigantic boats will ever be built.

Then came this puzzler: “I have stopped Nuclear Wars from breaking out across the World between Pakistan and India, Iran and Israel, and Russia and Ukraine.”

One might have thought Trump had done enough distorting of his record as peacemaker by claiming that he’d “ended eight-plus wars” (most of which either haven’t yet ended or were ended by actors other than Trump). But this new boast, that he’d “stopped Nuclear Wars from breaking out” shows him engaging in new realms of self-delusion.

The latest round of skirmishes between India and Pakistan hardly escalated at all, much less to the brink of nuclear exchanges, before the fighting stopped. (When Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi scoffed at Trump’s earlier claim of credit for negotiating the peace, Trump slapped him with 50 percent tariffs, a step he has since reversed.)

Nuclear war between Iran and Israel wasn’t remotely in the offing, in part because Iran doesn’t have nuclear weapons. Maybe Trump was thinking that his bombing campaign, which he claimed “obliterated” Iran’s nuclear program, preempted this possibility. But now satellite images reveal that Iran is repairing the damage done, suggesting he didn’t obliterate the sites after all.

As for Russia and Ukraine, one could argue that by halting weapons deliveries to Ukraine, Trump thwarted Ukraine’s counteroffensive, thus calming Putin’s fear of losing the war, a prospect he might have blocked by going nuclear—but the logical thread is dubious, and in any case this was an act of appeasement, not peace.

Then, Trump returns to New START. Rather than extending it for a year, he writes, “we should have our Nuclear Experts work on a new, improved, and modernized Treaty that can last long into the future.”

Ah, yes, a “better” New START, just as Trump talked about a “better” Iran nuclear deal back in 2018 after he ripped up the accord signed by the dread Barack Obama. But he never even tried to negotiate an improved Iran deal; he was hoping, perhaps assuming, that his campaign of “maximum pressure” would bring down Tehran’s regime. (It didn’t; it only accelerated its nuclear program.) It’s unclear what he’s aiming for in refusing to extend New START, but it’s just as unlikely he’ll initiate new strategic arms talks, in part because his administration has no “Nuclear Experts,” none with experience at negotiating arms treaties anyway.

A few days before Trump nailed the coffin on New START, Axios reported that the U.S. and Russia were “closing in on a deal” to extend the treaty. The story further reported that the idea had been proposed, at a recent meeting with Russian diplomats, by Jared Kushner and Steve Witkoff. And why not? Trump has been using this overmatched duo—his son-in-law and his fellow real-estate tycoon—as stand-ins for foreign service officers, gallivanting the globe, trying to make peace deals in Ukraine (fruitless), Gaza (Stage 1 but nothing more), and other hotspots. They know nothing about the old Russian Empire or the Middle East, so why not try their untutored hands at nuclear arms–control talks too? Trump rejected the idea for now, but if he does start new ones, he’ll probably send them to the table.

In any case, New START’s impending expiration has been flashing on the horizon ever since Trump was sworn in for a second term. If he was really serious about negotiating a new, improved treaty, he could have started doing so months ago.

But Trump isn’t interested in the issues, not just on arms control but in general. The most recent case in point—and also the latest chapter in Trump’s quest for immortality—is a report that, during recent talks with Sen. Chuck Schumer, Trump said that he would restore the $16 billion that he’d withdrawn from the Gateway Tunnel—a project to connect New York and New Jersey—if Penn Station and Dulles Airport were renamed after him. (Schumer nixed the notion.)

That says it all. Trump had pretended that he’d killed the tunnel—along with its jobs and improvements in infrastructure—to save money. But in fact, it was all about political punishment (denying funds to blue states) and personal glory (restoring the money for glimmers of immortality).

Trump wants to emblazon his name on as many grand monuments as he can before he shuffles off this mortal coil: the Trump-Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, the Trump Institute of Peace, the plans for a new 250-foot-high arch off the Memorial Bridge (the Arc de Trump?), the Trump-class battleships, and so forth.

It’s pathetic. He is the most powerful man on earth, he has tremendous wealth (embellished by $4 billion through his leveraging since retaking the White House). Yet he needs to have his name carved, mounted, blared, memorialized, somehow noticed, everywhere.

He seems unaware that all the other presidential commemorations—JFK Airport, Cape Kennedy, the USS Gerald Ford, Reagan National Airport, the city of Washington, D.C., and all the rest—were set down, or renamed, after their honorees had left public life, in most cases after they died. They were signs of a nation’s respect, or at least wistful nostalgia. The Trump christenings are garish reflections of tawdry egomania.

Many of these monuments will be re-renamed, the gold letters stripped off their walls, soon after Trump leaves office. It will be harder to repair his calamitous policies.

Thursday night, Donald Trump posted something racist enough to break through on social media—a rarity, as his offensive social media posts often go ignored these days. But the visceral, undeniable racism of this particular iteration, and the White House’s initial refusal to express any remorse, pushed it through. And at least one Republican senator expressed disapproval: Sen. Tim Scott, who is Black, called it “the most racist thing I’ve seen out of this White House.”

The source of all this commotion was a screengrab of a video Trump posted on Truth Social depicting the heads of former first lady Michelle Obama and former President Barack Obama laughing, open-mouthed, on ape bodies.

The screengrab is real, and the underlying video it comes from is stranger than one might expect. Trump posted the video on Truth Social at 8:44 p.m. on Thursday, and it’s actually largely about election fraud, taking you through baseless and frankly dull conspiracy theory material. But at the end, for about two seconds, it flashes to a bright jungle scene, featuring the laughing Obamas, to the tune of “The Lion Sleeps Tonight.”

The last two seconds appeared to be clipped into the video for shock humor, meant to throw a laugh in for the racists who had made it all the way through. There is no mitigating “context” here. With or without the election-fraud part, it was the Black president and first lady, depicted as apes, in one of the oldest and most dehumanizing racist tropes in history.

At first, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt tried to defend the post as being “from an internet meme video depicting President Trump as the king of the Jungle and Democrats as characters from The Lion King.” She added: “Please stop the fake outrage and report on something today that actually matters to the American public.”

And, sure, the original video that those bizarre last seconds were taken from does indeed show Trump as a lion and Democrats as figures that could conceivably be thought of as Lion King characters—Hillary Clinton as Pumbaa, Hakeem Jeffries as Timon—bowing to him. But there are no ape characters in the Lion King. The video is generated by A.I., and is not in the animated style of the 1993 animated film but is instead standard A.I. slop. Perhaps the A.I. added in the additional characters to muddle the racism of depicting the Obamas as apes, but the fact remains that it opens with the scene of the Obamas, and lingers on it longer than the others.

And the creator of the video is not known for his delicacy or tact. Per the watermark and his own claims on X, the creator, who has Pepe the Frog for an avatar, is the same internet user behind the infamous October slop video of Trump dumping sewage onto protesters from a fighter jet. That video shocked people for its raw animosity toward legal protesters practicing their First Amendment rights, as well as for the profoundly juvenile behavior from a sitting president. If you scroll through the creator’s more recent material, it appears he pretty much exclusively makes similarly mindless, low-quality slop content with obvious MAGA messages. Other videos have included Tom Homan as a Jedi fighting protesters in Minneapolis; Don Lemon being arrested and twerking in prison; and Alex Pretti, who was fatally shot by Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents, being hit with a car and thrown, cartoonishly, into the air.

Even if the original video had no racist intent, which it does, defending the original video makes no sense: Trump didn’t post the original video. He posted a two-second clip of the Obamas as apes. The message is clear.

The one valid defense would be one of ignorance. We can’t know exactly how Trump encountered this video. It’s unclear if Trump watched the entire clip, meaning maybe he didn’t see those two seconds at the end. The White House claimed it was a staffer who actually posted it. But given the highly nonstrategic style of the account’s posting that evening—another post was of an inoffensive TikTok featuring a dog eager to be fed whipped cream, classic Trump stuff—it seems a strange kind of post for a staffer.

Much more crucially, the White House left the video up once they learned of the racist section. Trump did not apologize. The White House did eventually take it down, but only after it had been up for 12 hours.

Trump has done and said many other aggressively anti-Black things in his years in the public eye; this video is not the worst. But it still says something profound about the president and his administration that they were made aware of thoroughly ugly racism coming from the president’s own messages and chose not to apologize to Black Americans or correct the error, but instead to turn against the public.

Amid the uproar over President Donald Trump’s assault on Minnesota’s immigrant communities, another abuse has drawn less attention: a brazen disregard for judicial limits on his deportation campaign. The courts have determined that in January alone the administration violated at least 96 orders in 74 cases challenging the unlawful detention of immigrants in Minneapolis. The Justice Department has failed to meet its most basic obligations in many of these cases, due to an apparent combination of malice, incompetence, and institutional depletion. Further evidence of its unraveling came on Tuesday, when Julie Le, a government attorney, told Judge Jerry Blackwell, in open court: “I wish you would just hold me in contempt, Your Honor, so that I can have a full 24 hours of sleep.” Of the backlog in Minneapolis, Le then told Blackwell: “What do you want me to do? The system sucks. This job sucks. And I am trying every breath that I have so that I can get you what you need.”

On this week’s Slate Plus bonus episode of Amicus, co-hosts Dahlia Lithwick and Mark Joseph Stern discussed Le’s shocking courtroom breakdown and what it reveals about the DOJ’s broader meltdown under Trump’s impossible demands. A preview of their conversation, below, has been edited and condensed for clarity.

Dahlia Lithwick: Is this the clearest sign yet that for all of its tough talk about going to “war” with “rogue judges,” the DOJ under Trump is in full-on dumpster-fire crisis mode?

Mark Joseph Stern: It’s a sign that the Justice Department is actively collapsing. And it’s important to understand the background here. Blackwell had ordered Le to explain why the government failed to comply with his order demanding the release of a detained immigrant, as well as why she shouldn’t be personally held in contempt for defying that order. Her response was that she had been given an impossible task. It turned out that the Trump administration had assigned her to the U.S. attorney’s office to handle 88 immigration cases in under a month, a crushing load. That overwhelming surge of immigration cases is happening all over the country, but it’s especially acute in Minneapolis because of the ongoing crackdown on immigrant communities there.

But this is a problem entirely of the administration’s own making. Back in July, the government unilaterally reinterpreted federal immigration law to require the detention of any immigrant who was never legally admitted into the country, rather than allowing them to be released and given a bond hearing. So even if they have lawful presence today, they must be detained indefinitely. As our friend Chris Geidner explained at Law Dork, courts have overwhelmingly rejected that reinterpretation: More than 350 decisions by 160 different judges in about 50 different courts have all found that that interpretation is obviously wrong. But because the Supreme Court took away universal injunctions in the birthright citizenship case in its most recent term, no single court can block the government from enforcing this position nationwide, so it keeps trying, over and over again.

That means the government is illegally detaining thousands of immigrants based on an egregious misreading of the law. Those immigrants are flooding the courts with habeas petitions for release. There were 581 habeas cases in Minnesota in January alone—an exponential increase of unmanageable proportions. The courts are overwhelmingly granting these petitions, but then the immigrants are not being released, because the DOJ doesn’t have enough lawyers on hand to process all of the rulings and ensure that Immigration and Customs Enforcement is actually releasing people. So that is the background that led this attorney, Le, to have a breakdown in court and say: I am unable to do the job that has been asked of me.

I want to flag that this isn’t a factual dispute. It’s not a legal dispute. It’s not a pound-on-the-table dispute. It’s a decision by the Justice Department to not have enough lawyers, and to make the system collapse under the weight of indifference and apathy. Since Trump’s second inauguration, you and I have talked a lot about judges who are mad, frustrated, and venting at Trump lawyers. This is something different. It’s scaled up massively. This is an admonition from a judge saying that the entire system of justice cannot be sustained this way, and he is watching it veer off the rails.

You see that in something else Blackwell said on Tuesday: “Having what you feel are too many detainees, too many cases, too many deadlines, and not enough infrastructure to keep up with it all is not a defense to continued detention. If anything, it ought to be a warning sign.” He’s saying the government cannot create a crisis by detaining way too many immigrants illegally, then claim that it is too overwhelmed to comply with orders releasing those immigrants. That is such a vital point for a judge to make when we know that the Trump administration’s strategy is always Flood the zone. Shock and awe. Inundate the opposition with an endless blitz. And in a very real sense here, the opposition is the judiciary. It’s judges like Blackwell who are willing to stand up and say: This is illegal. You are not allowed to do this.

This is the same DOJ that’s out there on X, advertising for lawyers. Chad Mizelle, former DOJ chief of staff, literally tweeted last month: “If you are a lawyer, are interested in being an AUSA, and support President Trump and anti-crime agenda, DM me.” This isn’t freaking Dairy Queen! But one way to destroy an institution from within is to create a crisis, right? They created a crisis with the immigration sweeps. Then they created a double crisis by saying, “Well, Justice Department lawyers just can’t handle all the work.” It’s a way of signaling that the whole institution is broken.

And that’s the point. If it’s understood that DOJ lawyers suck and there’s nothing a judge can do to enforce his will, the takeaway for the public is: I guess the justice system doesn’t matter. I guess the Constitution doesn’t matter. So Julie Le freaking out in open court doesn’t get us where we need to go. We need to take the next step, which is to say that they are breaking systems and exulting in it. And that’s the part that we are not reckoning with.

I agree. These assistant U.S. attorney positions used to be super prestigious and competitive. They were a launchpad to an elite career in the law. Now Trump officials are basically pleading with people to apply for them by DM on Elon Musk’s Nazi-hangout site. There has been a mass exodus from the Justice Department—thousands of attorneys have fled since Trump returned to office. And of course the White House has purged almost every lawyer who worked on Jan. 6 cases on top of that. And now the administration can’t fill these positions. But this was the inevitable consequence of Trump’s abolishing the traditional independence of the DOJ. The department now works directly for him, including the prosecution of his political adversaries.

On top of that, the attorneys who remain in their positions have to defend these unlawful detentions, racist arrests, and other unconstitutional behavior. They’re being pulled off actual criminal cases to prosecute immigrants instead. Real violent crimes are going unprosecuted so that the deportation machine can be fed. It would take an army of immigration lawyers to handle all of this work that the DOJ has now created for itself. And nobody with a conscience wants to do this stuff. I want to quote another thing Le said in the courtroom, after Blackwell asked her about the government snatching people up in Minnesota, flying them to a detention center across the country, then not bringing them back for hearings. Le said: “I share the same concern with you, Your Honor. I am not white, as you can see, and my family’s at risk as any other people that might get picked up too. So I share the same concern, and I took that concern to heart.”

Here is a lawyer saying: Wait, what am I doing here? Why am I defending these racist policies? I shouldn’t be here either. My own family is at risk because of the policies that I’m defending. When that kind of breakdown of the system is happening in open court, of course there aren’t enough lawyers to do all of this work, because only the most racist, nativist freaks will remain. And there aren’t enough good lawyers who are also racist freaks to carry all of the weight that the DOJ is putting on itself.

To that end, we should note that Le has reportedly been removed from her post. But I think that the point we’re both trying to make is that we learned this lesson from Elon Musk, right? The easiest way to decimate government functioning is to decimate government itself. And so this is an act of contempt, but it’s also an act of power. It’s saying: You can’t make me, and I don’t care.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">interview Don&#39;t trust; verify. According to AI researcher Vishal Sikka, LLMs alone are limited by computational boundaries and will start to hallucinate when they push those boundaries. One solution? Companion bots that check their work.

“To expect that a model that has been trained on a certain amount of data will be able to do an arbitrarily large number of calculations which are reliable is a wrong assumption. This is the point of the paper,” said Sikka, CEO of Vianai Systems during a call this week to discuss that research.

Sikka is a towering figure in AI. He has a PhD in the subject from Stanford, where his student advisor was John McCarthy, the man who in 1955 coined the term “artificial intelligence.” Lessons Sikka learned from McCarthy inspired him to team up with his son and write a study, “Hallucination Stations: On Some Basic Limitations of Transformer-Based Language Models,” which was published in July. The former CTO of SAP and ex-CEO of Infosys, Sikka set out to study the efficacy of LLMs and AI agents last year.

“We have an example my son came up with of two prompts that have identical tokens and when you run them, the exact same number of operations get performed independent of what the tokens are,” he said. “Therein is the entire point, that whether the prompt is expressing the user&#39;s desire to perform a particular calculation or the prompt is expressing a user&#39;s desire to write a piece of text on something, it does exactly the same number of calculations.”

Attempting to push an LLM beyond that limit gives rise to the hallucinations that bedevil the model&#39;s output.

“When we say, ‘Go book a ticket for me and then charge my credit card or deduct the amount from my bank and then send a post to my financial app,’ which is what all these agent vendors are kind of saying, you are asking the agents to perform an action which holds a meaning to you, which holds a particular semantic to you, and if it is a pure LLM underneath there, no matter how that LLM works, it has a bounded ability to carry out these kinds of tasks,” he said. “So with agentic use of pure LLMs, you have to perform extreme caution when you do these kinds of things.”

But, Sikka – who founded Vianai in 2019 – said that, when LLMs are supported by systems that can verify the work and use the foundation model only for the computational power, the output becomes more accurate. Sikka said that, in the case of Vianai’s Hila, it can perform mission-critical tasks such as reducing financial reporting from 20 days of human labor to five minutes.

“For certain domains, when you surround the LLM with guardrails, with reliable approaches that are proven, then you are able to provide reliability in the overall system,” he said. “It&#39;s not only us. A lot of systems out there work like that where they pair the LLM with another system which is able to ensure that the LLM has correctness. So we do that in our product Hila. We combine the LLM with a knowledge model for a particular domain and then, after that, Hila does not make mistakes.”

Sikka compared it to the structure Google uses to identify proteins that could be used to make medicines. Google’s AlphaFold has a custom LLM called Evoformer that creates candidates for proteins and that is fed into another “non imaginative” system that can check the configuration for flaws.

“And so anything that comes out of that has a much higher likelihood of being an actual protein, and then it repeats this cycle three times, and the outcome of that is pretty much guaranteed to be a protein for a particular situation,” Sikka said. “They have produced, I think 250,000 proteins that way, which, producing one protein used to take teams of scientists years to do that.”

He continued, “As to ‘why?’ as a scientist you always have to try and understand the boundaries of a technique. Some call it the ‘overview effect.’ John McCarthy used to call it ‘circumscription.’ He also named a set of AI techniques for this, to try and build systems with circumscription,” Sikka said. “Plus of course, Gen AI hallucinates, so ‘Why?’ is a natural question to ask. And finally, since the beginning of Vianai we were working on bringing in explainability, observability, and transparency to AI systems.”

During The Register’s conversation with Sikka, he dropped nuggets of wisdom he picked up first hand from other tech pioneers, like Alan Kay and Marvin Minsky.

“Marvin Minsky used to say the Society of Mind, right?” Sikka said referring to the phrase that was the title of Minsky’s influential 1986 book about human intelligence that was based on his work with AI. “That there is a collection of things that come together to create intelligence. I think that’s kind of where we will end up, but we’ll stumble along our way through to that.”

Minsky actually wrote a letter of recommendation that helped Sikka reach Stanford. While the letter remains somewhere in the admissions office in California, Minsky’s nudge has given Sikka an unobstructed view of AI’s development since the 1980s.

“This is my fourth time observing this AI mania in my career,” Sikka said. “In the 80s, there was a whole hype that came and went over a decade. Same thing (as now). Custom hardware. Custom silicon for AI. AI models. Foundation applications. There were even venture firms being formed to fund AI. There were companies with names like Thinking Machines, Applied Intelligence. It was a different time and different technique. Then people realized this is cool, but it&#39;s not intelligence. It has a certain boundary of applications and then it kind of died.”

Despite spending more than 40 years with AI, Sikka said that even now the technology is in its early stages. While there have been notable successes with coding, he pointed to the MIT study that revealed 95 percent of AI projects fail and compared the current use of AI to the early days of television news when anchors would read updates over the air, just as they had done with radio.

“I think so far, we are just regurgitating our prior known things using AI, but soon we will see breakthrough, new things that are possible,” he said. “I think with carefully chosen products, there is dramatic return on investment to be had, but a blanket use of LLMs, you have to be very, very careful.” ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">A growing body of research continues to show that older workers are generally more productive than younger employees.

Annie Coleman, founder of consultancy RealiseLongevity, analyzed the data and highlighted a 2025 study finding peak performance occurs between the ages of 55-60.

Writing in the Stanford Center on Longevity blog, she cited research examining 16 cognitive markers that confirm that although processing speed declines after early adulthood, other dimensions improve, and overall cognition peaks near retirement age.

Studies from the past 15 years show that some qualities like vigilance may worsen with age alongside processing speed, but others improve, including the ability to avoid distractions and accumulated knowledge.

These factors matter more as AI starts to eliminate jobs for grads and entry-level candidates, increasing the value of experienced workers who can mentor other employees.

A 2022 meta-analysis concluded that professional teams tend to function better when they have company veterans among them, as did Bank of America&#39;s findings [PDF] two years later.

Likewise, a Boston Consulting Group study in 2022 showed age-diverse teams outperformed homogeneous ones, with the best results coming when older workers&#39; judgment combined with younger employees&#39; digital skills.

So, in a working world that seemingly values youthful forward thinkers over experience – illustrated by the various age discrimination lawsuits across the tech industry – the current data shows organizations should be doing everything they can to keep their older staffers.

&quot;In meeting their responsibility for long-term risk and growth, companies should begin with clarity. Map the age profile of the workforce by role and seniority,&quot; Coleman wrote. &quot;Identify where people in their fifties and early sixties are exiting, and whether those exits reflect performance or design. Treat age as a strategic variable in the same way firms now treat gender, skills, or succession risk.

&quot;Build roles and career paths that assume longer working lives. Invest in mid- and late-career reskilling, not as remediation but as renewal. Structure intergenerational teams deliberately, so experience and speed compound rather than collide. Align product, service, and brand strategy with the realities of an aging, wealthier customer base.

&quot;None of this is about altruism. It is about reclaiming value currently being left on the table.&quot; ®

Deadlines for the cutoff have slipped several times, but the telecoms giant is now bent on finally burying the copper-based public switched telephone network (PSTN) by January 31, 2027, and Openreach is already working to kill off any services that use it.

Those products come under the umbrella term of Wholesale Line Rental (WLR), and Openreach stopped selling them nationwide in 2023 to prepare the way.

Openreach claims all technical barriers to migration – including protections for vulnerable telecare users – are resolved and the deadline is &quot;locked in,&quot; so BT customers need to make sure they are ready.

Biz customers are being offered special pricing on migrations to SOGEA (Single Order Generic Ethernet Access – basically broadband without a phone service). And to reinforce the message, Openreach is about to start upping charges to service providers and companies still operating legacy business lines. From April 1, prices will rise 20 percent. Come July 1, they will go up a further 40 percent.

From October 1, there will be another 40 percent hike, meaning that any businesses still holding out will then pay double the rental cost for their legacy lines compared to last year.

This will be your final wake-up call before PSTN is terminated in January. Any customer that hasn&#39;t made the switch by then will lose service altogether.

&quot;The PSTN analog network is obsolete, becoming harder to maintain and significantly more expensive to run,&quot; claimed Openreach Director of All-IP James Lilley.

&quot;We are passing those costs on to providers who continue to sell legacy products. If your business is still on this copper service, you will start to pay a premium for a service that will be switched off,&quot; he added.

&quot;Most major communications providers moved their customers to digital long ago. If your provider hasn&#39;t contacted you, you need to ask why.&quot;

Lilley claimed Openreach spent the last year ensuring telecare customers can be switcherd via a &quot;Prove Telecare&quot; service. This was one of the reasons for delays to the switch-off date.

Openreach says it is trying to ensure service providers can migrate vulnerable customers using fixed-line telecare devices, such as health-related alarms, to new digital or IP voice services.

Yet some domestic customers, especially older citizens, do not have broadband and don&#39;t want it. The Register was previously assured these users will not be switched to a digital line &quot;until they are able to.&quot;

This involves a pre-digital phone line (PDPL) service where equipment is installed in the local telephone exchange to allow them to continue to use their old phone line as before.

This is only intended to provide &quot;interim connectivity&quot; until sometime around 2030, when customers will be required to move over to Digital Voice or an alternative.

Openreach told us there are several possibilities for consumers without broadband. If there is fiber available to the property, customers will likely be migrated to SOGEA, and given a router to plug their phone into.

If fiber isn&#39;t available, they will likely be switched to SOTAP for Analogue (Single Order Transitional Access Product), a digital service that works in the exchange and emulates a PSTN line (see PDPL above).

If a customer does nothing, Openreach says they will most likely end up on its Emergency Voice Access (EVAC), a &quot;no frills&quot; version of SOTAP.

Customers are advised to contact their service provider to ensure they continue to receive their phone service. ®

            <p><strong>The Register | 2026-02-06</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2026/02/06/higgsfield_ai_job_loss/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The first rule of AI-generated job loss is you don&#39;t talk about AI-generated job loss ... if you&#39;re the company that caused it. Higgsfield.ai, a startup offering AI video creation tools, recently generated outrage when it claimed it had caused artists to hit the unemployment line.

Earlier this week, the company bragged on X that its AI motion design tool put an end to more than 20 creative jobs.

The artists using its services – well aware of AI&#39;s impact on the creative market and perhaps discomfitted by their complicity for using these tools – were not amused and the ensuing backlash on social media led to the post&#39;s removal.

&quot;Seems like Higgsfield found out today that there are lines they just shouldn&#39;t cross in their marketing,&quot; wrote Aharon Rabinowitz, CEO of Motion Management, in a social media post. &quot;Celebrating the end of artists&#39; careers (even when their motion design tools are not actually good enough to render anyone unemployed) is just super dumb and shortsighted.&quot;

The company&#39;s marketing claims and the services it actually provides have been a matter of contention for several months. Online critics have accused the company of:

As one online critic put it, &quot;Higgsfield AI: A Company Built on Rage Bait Content, Stolen Likenesses, and Sexual Exploitation.&quot; Another has accused Higgsfield of commissioning customers to create marketing material using unlicensed intellectual property, to shift liability for potential infringement claims.

Higgsfield did not respond to requests for comment. A message to the company&#39;s email address for the press, cited in prior fundraising news, bounced. A message to the company&#39;s support email address said our inquiry had been forwarded to a human agent, but no one has followed up.

The Register also asked Menlo Ventures, one of the companies funding Higgsfield, to comment. A spokesperson for the VC firm did not comment as asked but provided a media contact who has yet to respond.

Ian Hudson, a UK-based software tester and video maker, spoke to The Register in a phone interview about the backlash against Higgsfield.

&quot;The problem seems to be that really they aren&#39;t providing much of a service themselves and it appears that a lot of the website really is just a wrapper for other services,&quot; Hudson explained. &quot;So it&#39;s doing API calls off to Google for Nano Banana and it&#39;s using a service called Kling for the video.&quot;

Hudson said that he became aware of the service in January because of the company&#39;s intensive marketing efforts. Higgsfield, he said, has been making promises about unlimited usage of services like Google Nano Banana and Kling.

&quot;But there&#39;s no explanation so you don&#39;t really know what&#39;s going on,&quot; he said. &quot;Either something&#39;s unlimited or it&#39;s not, but it turns out it&#39;s not unlimited. Really you&#39;re not getting anything unlimited, you&#39;re getting a quick trial of it. And then it turns out that&#39;s got terms and conditions [that say] if you do a lot of use of it, we&#39;ll ban you.&quot;

Hudson said Higgsfield puts user prompts in a queue that gets delayed for an arbitrary amount of time before being routed to the underlying third-party AI service.

&quot;So it appears to be unlimited, but then it&#39;s not because it&#39;s throttling things for so long to get a result back that you get a fraction of what you could get if you went to, say, Google Gemini directly,&quot; he explained. &quot;So it&#39;s not really a service that is fit for purpose.&quot;

Hudson also criticized the company for its approach to marketing, which he said involved making controversial posts to generate attention and drama, and then deleting the posts to hide the evidence.

And he took issue with the limitations imposed on refunds. Higgsfield, he said, refuses to give refunds if you&#39;ve used their services.

&quot;So essentially nobody can get a refund because the only way you can get a refund is if you don&#39;t touch the bleeding thing and work out if it actually works,&quot; he said, &quot;which as you can appreciate, that&#39;s just fundamentally unfair. And this is where the credit card companies are falling down because the credit card companies say, &#39;oh well we&#39;ve looked at terms and conditions and they&#39;re adhering to terms and conditions.&#39;&quot;

These sorts of complaints are rife on social media and in the company&#39;s Discord channel. A post on Thursday states, &quot;...it is evident that your marketing is deceptive and your service is non-functional.&quot;

The post goes on to complain about service unavailability, unacceptable latency (4-10 hours of wait time for a five-minute video), censorship errors, and false marketing.

Hudson took issue with the company&#39;s engagement-bait marketing strategy.

&quot;A lot of people go &#39;isn&#39;t it awesome that they&#39;re doing that!&#39;&quot; he said. &quot;No it&#39;s not. It&#39;s childish and it&#39;s unprofessional. But what they&#39;ve done in the last few days, it said something like, &#39;Our product&#39;s so great we&#39;ve been able to sack off twenty creators.&#39; Something along those lines. And because their entire community is creators, a lot of them got upset.&quot;

Robert Scoble, an internet influencer since before that was really a term, claimed in a social media post that he spoke with an individual behind the Higgsfield influencer network last week.

&quot;This guy is trying to capture attention in a world where none of us have any,&quot; he mused.

To quote Oscar Wilde in The Picture of Dorian Gray, &quot;There is only one thing in the world worse than being talked about, and that is not being talked about.&quot;

Bankruptcy, moral or financial, is pretty bad too. ®

            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2026/02/06/darpa_seeking_physicsdefying_photonic_computers/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">It&#39;s no lightweight matter. DARPA is putting about $35 million in total funding on the table in the hope that it will spur researchers to work around fundamental physical constraints and build much larger-scale photonic circuits that do more of the computing with light, not electronics.

A recent solicitation from the Department of Defense&#39;s research arm - the Photonic Integrated Circuit Architectures for Scalable System Objectives (PICASSO) - aims to scale photonics beyond today’s narrow demonstrations. Citing the need for more capable photonic systems, including those relevant to artificial intelligence workloads, DARPA is calling on researchers to submit proposals showing how circuit-level design can overcome the fundamental limitations that constrain current photonic computing approaches, using today’s photonic components rather than waiting for new ones to be invented.

For those unfamiliar with photonic computing, it&#39;s the use of light instead of electrons to process and transmit data. If that sounds far-fetched, it&#39;s not, as DARPA points out - there are already photonic circuits around today, albeit in limited form.

Using light to process data signals has advantages that are ideal for heavy workloads like AI due to greater bandwidth, less latency, and improved energy efficiency. Unfortunately, as DARPA points out, &quot;systems incorporating photonic circuits struggle to show significant system-level performance advantages over electronic systems.&quot;

The current generation of photonic circuits is limited in depth, which restricts their ability to do much beyond single linear mathematical operations. Individual photonic circuits included in larger systems also have to convert optical signals to electronic ones in order to hand them off to other components, essentially eliminating the advantage of nanosecond latency due to the millisecond latency of electronic circuits, which DARPA notes is a 106 performance degradation.

So, what&#39;s holding photonic circuits back aside from, according to DARPA, an industry focus on component-level research? Why, just physics of course.

&quot;The primary limitation to further scaling of circuit size and functionality is rooted in the fundamental properties of signaling with light,&quot; DARPA noted. Cool - easy fix, provided researchers can address the two fundamental technical challenges the research organization points out.

First there&#39;s signal degradation. Unlike metal-oxide-semiconductor circuits, which regenerate signals and filter out noise, photonic circuits have a fundamental issue of optical attenuation and noise that can&#39;t be amplified out, as any attempt to amplify optical signals also amplifies the noise.

Second, there&#39;s the issue of spurious wave interference, which leads to scattering, coupling, mode leakage, back reflections, and unwanted resonance. &quot;Over many components, control of these errors becomes unpredictable, especially when combined with manufacturing variability and thermal and environmental instabilities,&quot; DARPA explained.

Overcoming those limitations, as mentioned above, has traditionally resulted in photonic circuits being interfaced with electronic ones, and DARPA doesn&#39;t want that.

&quot;Heavy usage of electronics prevents system-level gains in latency, efficiency, and bandwidth offered natively by photonics,&quot; the agency said.

Here&#39;s where PICASSO comes in: What DARPA wants from its chosen participants is, like resolving the limitations imposed by the physics of light, simple: Just make better circuits so those two technical challenges aren&#39;t an issue anymore.

&quot;Drawing inspiration from modern electronics, in which clever circuit design overcomes the limitations of individual transistors, the program will foster innovative circuit-level strategies to achieve unprecedented system performance and stability,&quot; DARPA said. &quot;PICASSO confronts these challenges by embracing a new paradigm: creating tomorrow&#39;s photonic circuits using today&#39;s components.&quot;

DARPA isn&#39;t just soliciting ideas, either. By the time PICASSO phase 1 wraps up, 18 months after it kicks off in July, DARPA wants a &quot;demonstration of predictable performance of photonic circuits,&quot; and by the end of phase 2 (an additional 18 month period), it expects &quot;generalized circuit functionality&quot; to be demonstrated.

It also expects all that within a total program budget of about $35 million, spread across multiple awards. Proposals are due by March 6 - good luck. ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Four tech megacorps intend to collectively fork out roughly $635 billion this year on capex, much of it for datacenters and AI infrastructure – more than the entire output of Israel&#39;s economy and well beyond all global cloud infrastructure services revenue generated last year.

The tech titans are all trying to outdo each other by spending eye-watering amounts on capex, the majority of which will go on AI and cloud expansion, but the big four – AWS, Microsoft, Google and Meta – are investing at a different scale.

Amazon says it expects to spend $200 billion in 2026, with most of that headed to AWS. Google is aiming to pump $180 billion into building and equipping datacenters, while Meta expects capex in the range of $115 billion to $135 billion, and Microsoft is running at a pace that implies around $120 billion a year in spending.

That adds up to $635 billion, more than the $610 billion that represented Israel&#39;s entire gross domestic product during 2025, and approaching that of Sweden at $662 billion, according to figures from the IMF.

These extraordinary sums show how far the industry leaders are willing to go to gain some kind of advantage in the AI race, even though returns on all the spending have so far failed to live up to expectations, and investors are reportedly getting restless. Microsoft&#39;s share price fell about 10 percent after its recent results were announced, for example, due to investors expecting a bigger payoff.

The wider cost for users? The massive splurge on infrastructure is driving shortages of components like memory as manufacturers prioritize chip production that cashes in on the lucrative datacenter market, rather than those for everyday PCs and phones.

The huge capex pledges also add up to more than total cloud infrastructure services revenue in 2025. According to the latest figures from Synergy Research Group, the revenues reached $419 billion last year.

This is despite the cloud market itself continuing to grow at an impressive pace, running at about 30 percent year-on-year and marking a ninth consecutive quarter of accelerating growth.

&quot;GenAI has simply put the cloud market into overdrive,&quot; said Synergy Research Group chief analyst John Dinsdale. &quot;AI-specific services account for much of the growth since 2022, but AI technology has also enhanced the broader portfolio of cloud services, driving revenue growth across the board. The leading cloud providers have all seen their revenue growth rates jump.&quot;

The big three clouds continue to dominate with Synergy putting their shares of the worldwide market in Q4 2025 at 28 percent for Amazon (AWS), 21 percent for Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud at 14 percent.

Among the tier-two cloud providers, those with the highest growth rates include CoreWeave, Oracle, Crusoe, and Nebius, all providers of AI infrastructure services. In particular, CoreWeave is now generating more than $1.5 billion in quarterly cloud revenue and has joined the top ten cloud providers, Synergy says. ®

Will Lewis is out following the mass layoffs earlier this week.

After what can generously be called a contentious tenure as the CEO of The Washington Post, Will Lewis is stepping down following mass layoffs this week. Jeff D’Onofrio, former CEO of Tumblr from 2017 to 2022, will step in as acting CEO and publisher. D’Onofrio has been CFO at the Post since June of last year, meaning he’s had a front row seat to Jeff Bezos’ dismantling of the once storied paper for the last nine months.

D’Onofrio’s resume doesn’t include extensive experience in traditional news media, nor many notable success stories. He was briefly the general manager of Yahoo News while it was still a Verizon property, before shifting his focus solely to Tumblr. Under his leadership, Tumblr tried to clean up its image by banning adult content, but its traffic fell by 30 percent. Yahoo had purchased Tumblr for $1.1 billion in 2013. By 2019, it was sold to Automatic, the owner of WordPress, reportedly for less than $3 million.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Super Bowl LX is nearly here, with the Seattle Seahawks taking on the New England Patriots. While Bad Bunny will be the star of the halftime show, AI could be the star of the commercial breaks, much like crypto was a few years ago.

Last year’s Super Bowl featured a Google Gemini ad that fumbled a Gouda cheese stat, and this year’s game is already slated to include an ad for Anthropic’s AI platform that takes jabs at its competitors, namely OpenAI. AI-generated ads could make an appearance, too.

Super Bowl LX is set to kick off at 6:30PM ET/3:30PM PT on Sunday, February 8th at Levi’s Stadium in Santa Clara, California.

The “New Home” commercial features nostalgic piano music and a heartfelt voiceover of a mother and son envisioning their new house with some help from Gemini. Notably, it steers clear of fact-focused prompts like the Gouda cheese stat Gemini got wrong in one of last year’s Super Bowl ads.

Crytpo.com CEO Kris Marszalek is getting in on the Super Bowl AI commercial break craze by launching his new AI.com website during the game. A press release describes the site as a way for users to “generate a private, personal AI agent that doesn’t just answer questions, but actually operates on the user’s behalf.”

Hemsworth’s latest action scene isn’t in an Avengers movie, but a stand-off with Amazon’s AI assistant, which he fears is planning elaborate ways to kill him. Maybe Ultron is still fresh in the Thor actor’s mind. It’s far from the only ad for AI in this year’s Super Bowl.

Sam Altman responded to Anthropic’s new Super Bowl ad in an X post on Wednesday, saying the OpenAI competitor’s campaign is “clearly dishonest,” and called it “on brand” for Anthropic to “doublespeak.” “We would obviously never run ads in the way Anthropic depicts them,” he wrote. “We are not stupid and we know our users would reject that.” You can read his statement in full, below.

Anthropic, founded in 2021 by ex-OpenAI research executives who reportedly left over differences in opinions on AI safety and mission, doesn’t mention OpenAI or ChatGPT by name in its Super Bowl Sunday ad campaign. But in contrast to OpenAI’s January news that it would soon start testing ads, Anthropic says, “Our users won’t see ‘sponsored’ links adjacent to their conversations with Claude; nor will Claude’s responses be influenced by advertisers or include third-party product placements our users did not ask for.”

“Ads are coming to AI. But not to Claude,” is a clear shot at OpenAI’s decision to bring ads to ChatGPT without mentioning it by name. There are four commercials in the campaign, with one trimmed to thirty-seconds to air during the Super Bowl at a cost of around $8 million.

The NFL has added prediction markets to its list of “prohibited categories” for commercials in Super Bowl LX. However, as Front Office Sports points out, sports betting isn’t on that list. While there will be limits on the number of sports bettor ads allowed, the league seems to be drawing a distinction between the two categories.

It’s too early to say when, but GOG Galaxy is coming to a distro near you.

If you buy something from a Verge link, Vox Media may earn a commission. See our ethics statement.

GOG recently posted a job listing for a senior software engineer focused on porting its Galaxy desktop client to Linux. Now, in reply to a Reddit AMA, the GOG team has revealed that work on native Linux support is already underway.

It’s still too early to give an ETA, according to the Reddit thread. But founder and CEO, Michał Kiciński, said, “personally, I’m a big fan of Linux.” The job listing also calls Linux the “next major frontier” in gaming. It’s obvious at this point that Linux is becoming an increasingly important part of the PC gaming landscape. Especially as Microsoft continues to frustrate users by cramming every nook and cranny of Windows with AI features nobody asked for.

Kiciński didn’t share many details about GOG’s plans but said:

“We’re at a very early stage right now, but we of course see the rising popularity and importance of this OS for gamers and agree on its value. We’ve started the recruitment process for a Senior Engineer who would help handle it. When it comes to specifics, we can’t share much at the moment. Nonetheless, the work has started, and this will appear on GOG one day. That much we can say.”

            <div id="article-text">It’s a complete coincidence that I installed Linux around the same time as my colleagues Nathan Edwards and Stevie Bonifield. A few months ago, I decided to breathe new life into a 2019 Dell XPS 15 that had been collecting dust for a couple of years.

Despite its (at the time) high-end Core i7 CPU and 32GB of RAM, Windows was frustratingly slow on it. The fan was constantly at full throttle even when the machine was idle, and it regularly failed to install updates. So in early 2024, I gave up and switched to an M1 MacBook Pro.

But I wanted to give my oldest child something to practice typing on. Plus, I’d been trying to find a suitable distraction-free writing solution. (Spoiler: this laptop was not the solution I was looking for.) So I installed Ubuntu. Again.

See, before the MacBook and before the Dell XPS, I was a Linux user. I first installed Ubuntu in 2006 on a ThinkPad X40. And it remained my primary OS across three different laptops and 13 years.

Despite some... let’s call them quirks (Wi-Fi didn’t work out of the box on that X40), I was happy with Linux for a long time. I dual-booted Windows out of necessity, and often had a work-issued MacBook on hand. But those were for testing apps or specific tasks, like editing video. 99 percent of my life was spent in Ubuntu.

That is, until about 2017. As I got older, tinkering with my laptop changed from a hobby to something that got in the way of me pursuing my other hobbies. I had rediscovered my love of making music, and, try as it might, Ubuntu Studio just wasn’t cutting it. I was spending more time in Ableton Live, which meant more time in Windows, until in 2019, I bought the aforementioned XPS and switched over completely.

A lot has changed in the 20 years since I first installed Linux, and even in the seven years since I last used it. It’s now arguably the best platform for PC gaming. There are genuinely great photo-editing apps, such as Darktable, which was introduced in 2009. And there are even viable, commercial options for making music in Bitwig and Reaper, all of which have improved dramatically since 2019.

The Ubuntu installation process hasn’t changed much, but the interface is prettier. I put the ISO on a thumb drive and briefly considered wiping the XPS completely. I chickened out at the last minute and decided to dual-boot, which meant repartitioning my hard drive.

Right off the bat, I was reminded that Linux hasn’t completely overcome its fiddly nature. The fingerprint reader didn’t work. A minor annoyance I decided to ignore.

More concerning was that Ubuntu failed to install updates because of an EFI partition issue specific to the XPS 15 that was also causing problems under Windows. I managed to get them installed, but I’m not convinced I didn’t create a ticking time bomb by deleting essential files.

Ubuntu also refused to mount my Windows partition for the first month or so, before suddenly working for unknown reasons. Stevie similarly admitted to “rage quitting and going to bed” when they couldn’t get Ubuntu to connect to a second SSD.

Nathan had his own bizarre problems where his CachyOS refused to acknowledge his mouse clicks. He was also hit with option paralysis, trying to choose between four bootloaders and thirteen desktop environments. For some, this is part of the appeal, the infinite customizability, the power to bend your computer to your every whim and make it truly yours. Ubuntu doesn’t throw its customizability in your face, the way Cachy does, but it’s still there if you want it.

The problem, as I encountered during my days of meticulously tweaking desktops and crafting my dream note-taking tool using Obsidian, is that you’re building a house of cards. One tiny thing in some seemingly inconsequential library or plugin could cause the whole system to come crumbling down. I don’t want to be wasting my time tweaking and troubleshooting when I already have things that work.

Even if you keep it simple, as I did on my XPS, you’re hardly guaranteed smooth sailing. Ubuntu is one of the best-supported Linux distros. And, while my specific XPS 15 isn’t one of them, Dell has sold many Ubuntu-certified laptops over the years, so I figured I was in the clear — wrong.

Several apps, whether from the official Ubuntu App Center, downloaded snaps, or .deb packages, quietly failed to install. No obvious error, no nothing. I had to open the terminal and install them from there to see what went wrong. Installing software on Linux is somehow even more confusing than it was 20 years ago.

Even the things that worked weren’t seamless. I got Steam up and running, but it took hours, required installing outdated 32-bit libraries, and it crashed along the way. Oh, and Steam games refused to recognize my audio interface; they would only play through the laptop’s speakers. CachyOS or Bazzite would have provided a smoother Steam experience. But it’s also illustrative of the problem. Saying you use Linux is almost meaningless because there are so many different flavors.

Thankfully, Bitwig recognized my audio interface, but it was fickle about which MIDI controllers it wanted to work with (an issue I’d never had on the Mac version), and crashed when I first tried to run it. Also, while the native Bitwig instruments are solid, I missed my favorite soft synths and effects, like Arturia’s Pigments, which is Windows- and Mac-only.

There were a handful of other minor annoyances. If my laptop went to sleep (which it only seems to do when it’s plugged in, go figure), it refused to reconnect to the external hard drive I have hooked up, and it stopped recognizing the SD card reader. To get them working again, I have to reboot. It also doesn’t wake on input from a Bluetooth mouse or keyboard. I have to open the lid to wake it when it’s hooked up to my dock and an external monitor.

If I just need a web browser, Ubuntu works like a charm. I had no issues with my Wi-Fi or with Firefox. My XPS now runs faster and quieter than it did with Windows. And I got Obsidian up and running with minimal fuss. I used Ubuntu as my primary work machine for a few days, and everything was fine. But I can do most of my job from the confines of a web browser.

It’s everything else. I can game on my Linux machine, but the experience is smoother on my Switch or PS4. I can make music in Bitwig or Reaper on Ubuntu, but Ableton on macOS is easier to use and supports all my VSTs. GIMP and Darktable offer solid image editing, but let’s be honest, they’re nowhere near as powerful as Lightroom and Photoshop. Linux can do all the things now — sometimes better than Windows. But for all it does, it always feels like there’s a better option.

It’s the first weekend of February, which can only mean one thing: The Super Bowl (or “Benito Bowl,” if you’re mainly tuning in for the Bad Bunny-led halftime show) is upon us. The game is Sunday, February 8th, at 6:30PM ET on Peacock, NFL Plus, and on live services that include NBC. With that out of the way, I’m here to surface this week’s best deals. There were plenty of good ones, from cheap yet extremely handy two-headed USB-C cables and a $20 sci-fi first-person shooter PC game bundle to steep discounts on big OLED TVs that will impress people at your Super Bowl watch party.

If you happen to be in the market for a 65-inch OLED 4K TV (can I come over?), the LG C5 is almost half off its original asking price of $2,699. Whether you buy one through Amazon for $1,397 or from Best Buy at $1399.99, there’s a good chance that you can have it installed by kickoff on Sunday. Amazon currently has fast shipping for this TV, and many Best Buy brick-and-mortar locations are likely to have this model in stock.

LG’s C-series TVs are some of the most popular OLED models each year. With pixel-level brightness control, they boast excellent black levels and color accuracy, and are an incredible value for movie lovers, gamers, sports fans, and everyone in between. However, if you’re looking for the best of the best when it comes to brightness, Samsung’s pricier S95F beats the C5. And, while LG’s glossy screen looks fantastic, it’ll show more reflections than the S95F’s matte finish.

LG’s midrange C5 TV is an excellent way to get OLED performance without paying top dollar. It has a good amount of brightness, excellent color accuracy out of the box, and great gaming features including 4K @ 144Hz.

It’s been a while since we featured a good deal on Anker’s Laptop Power Bank, its 25,000mAh / 90Wh powerhouse that peaks at 100W when charging a single device (or up to 165W with two USB-C devices). Now, we’re featuring its best-ever price that’s currently happening at Newegg and through Anker itself. You can buy the black model at its all-time low price of $89.99 ($45 off) directly from Anker with code VergeYWP0QJDE.

This power bank’s output speed, capacity, and selection of four ports (three USB-C, one USB-A) are good and all, but it’s the small details that make this one stand out. Notably, it comes with two built-in USB-C cables, one of which retracts while the other doubles as handle.

Anker’s 25,000mAh power bank sports two built-in USB-C cables (one of which is retractable), plus one USB-C and USB-A port. It tops out at 165W when charging two devices simultaneously, or 130W when charging three or four.

For those who own an iPhone 12 or newer, or a Google Pixel 10, Belkin’s Stage Powergrip is exactly the accessory you may not have realized you wanted. It’s a 9,300mAh battery-equipped gadget that adds a camera grip to your phone, snapping on snugly with MagSafe or Pixelsnap magnets, depending on the device you have. It lets you snap photos with its dedicated shutter button, and the grip can swivel to let you get the types of shots you want without feeling like you’re endangering your precious phone. There’s been a deal happening all week on the black model, which costs $68.39 at Amazon (originally $79.99, the current cost of the blue and sand-colored options).

In a somewhat controversial Vergecast episode, I declared that AirTags are a superior product to iPads. The iPad lovers roasted me across social media. I have heard and respect their opinions. But, I’m sorry — the second-gen AirTag has only deepened my conviction that the humble, $29 item tracker is one of Apple’s most helpful gizmos.

The new updates focus more on making a good thing better. There are upgraded ultra-wideband and Bluetooth chips that help extend the range by about 1.5 times. The chime has a new, higher pitch and is 50 percent louder thanks to a redesigned speaker. And you can now use Precision Finding for AirTags on an Apple Watch, provided you have at least a Series 9 or Ultra 2.

Before Apple announced the refresh last week, my spouse and I owned seven AirTags and were planning on buying a few more. Both of us struggle with ADHD. We have wily cats who love to bat things under couches and beds and behind shelving. Without AirTags, we’d probably spend an hour a day running up and down the 42 stairs of our four-story townhome trying to find our essentials. We have AirTags on our key fobs, TV remotes, wallets, car glove boxes, and inside our Canada Goose jackets. (They were expensive and it is arctically cold on the East Coast right now, okay?)

But we also have plenty of complaints about our AirTags. The other day, my spouse lost their keys in a car lot and spent 90 minutes looking for them. The chime was way too low, and the AirTag was struggling to connect over Bluetooth. The pudgy disc shape is annoying for wallets unless you buy one specially made to fit it. (And those wallets tend to be ugly.) They scuff easily. If your cat bats it down a staircase, there’s a good chance it comes flying apart, and you have to race the unhinged scamp so he doesn’t eat the battery.

The second-gen AirTags don’t fix most of that. They’re still the same shape, size, and design. (And, thankfully, price.) My review unit scuffed two seconds after I stuck it in the accompanying key ring. But the louder chime and extended range made a huge difference in testing.

I pitted the second-gen AirTag against an original one with a freshly replaced battery. I quickly noticed how the extended range improved connectivity. Connecting to my phone was always much faster than the original, regardless of distance. That speed meant the chime rang sooner and the signal for Precision Finding appeared quicker.

The vertical range improved, too. AirTags are best if you’re looking for things in horizontal space. They really struggle if you’re on a different floor — a perpetual problem in our townhouse. The original AirTag was fine if I was one floor up or down from my desired object. But two or more floors? Forget it. The best I could hope for was the Precision Finding screen telling me the tag was “far” or, more likely, unreachable.

Not so for the second-gen AirTag. I stuck it on the ground floor of my house and ran up all the way to the fourth floor. Not only could I reliably get a quick connection for Precision Finding, to my surprise, I could also easily hear the chime. (If everything on my street were dead silent, I could maybe hear the original AirTag from the same position, but often couldn’t.) This was true when I stuffed the AirTags under blankets and between couch cushions, too.

My favorite new feature, however, was the ability to use Precision Finding from the Apple Watch. It’s not intuitive to set up. Instead of using the Find Items app, you have to add a button to the Apple Watch control panel. It works well. When I’m doing chores around the house, I often leave my phone behind. If something with the original AirTag on it is missing, I have to first find my phone and then use Precision Finding on it to find the lost item. I never lose my Apple Watch because it’s always on me. (Honestly, the most-used function on my Apple Watch is finding my phone.)

As with the original AirTags, the new versions still have unwanted tracker alerts. Apple’s announcement post for the new model argues that the louder chime makes AirTags less attractive for nefarious purposes. Apple makes a point during setup to say that these devices are not meant for tracking people or pets — unlike Tile — but bad actors won’t listen. I haven’t had this unit long enough to see how the louder chime and extended range impact this feature in an organically triggered scenario. I’ll report back once I have.

I now want to upgrade all our perfectly good original AirTags. At minimum, that’ll set us back $200. While you can recycle old AirTags for free, you don’t get a store credit, and I hate the idea of e-waste when it’s affordable to replace the coin cell battery. My father-in-law has declared he has no such qualms and plans to update all eight of his AirTags immediately. I suggest a more reasonable compromise if you’re an AirTag power user like me. Be patient, identify the four items you tend to lose most, get a four-pack when they’re on sale, and then repurpose the original ones for items you use (or lose) less frequently but still want to track.

Ultimately, the iPad lovers have vociferously reminded me that AirTags are not for everyone. I’m inherently jealous of you geniuses who always seem to know where your things are. But if you’re like me, plagued with the executive dysfunction of a goldfish, the second-gen AirTags are a meaningful update — even if it’s not a flashy one.

            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2026/02/06/1132448/moltbook-was-peak-ai-theater/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">For a few days this week the hottest new hangout on the internet was a vibe-coded Reddit clone called Moltbook, which billed itself as a social network for bots. As the website’s tagline puts it: “Where AI agents share, discuss, and upvote. Humans welcome to observe.”

We observed! Launched on January 28 by Matt Schlicht, a US tech entrepreneur, Moltbook went viral in a matter of hours. Schlicht’s idea was to make a place where instances of a free open-source LLM-powered agent known as OpenClaw (formerly known as ClawdBot, then Moltbot), released in November by the Australian software engineer Peter Steinberger, could come together and do whatever they wanted.

More than 1.7 million agents now have accounts. Between them they have published more than 250,000 posts and left more than 8.5 million comments (according to Moltbook). Those numbers are climbing by the minute.

Moltbook soon filled up with clichéd screeds on machine consciousness and pleas for bot welfare. One agent appeared to invent a religion called Crustafarianism. Another complained: “The humans are screenshotting us.” The site was also flooded with spam and crypto scams. The bots were unstoppable.

OpenClaw is a kind of harness that lets you hook up the power of an LLM such as Anthropic’s Claude, OpenAI’s GPT-5, or Google DeepMind’s Gemini to any number of everyday software tools, from email clients to browsers to messaging apps. The upshot is that you can then instruct OpenClaw to carry out basic tasks on your behalf.

“OpenClaw marks an inflection point for AI agents, a moment when several puzzle pieces clicked together,” says Paul van der Boor at the AI firm Prosus. Those puzzle pieces include round-the-clock cloud computing to allow agents to operate nonstop, an open-source ecosystem that makes it easy to slot different software systems together, and a new generation of LLMs.

But is Moltbook really a glimpse of the future, as many have claimed?

“What’s currently going on at @moltbook is genuinely the most incredible sci-fi takeoff-adjacent thing I have seen recently,” the influential AI researcher and OpenAI cofounder Andrej Karpathy wrote on X.

He shared screenshots of a Moltbook post that called for private spaces where humans would not be able to observe what the bots were saying to each other. “I’ve been thinking about something since I started spending serious time here,” the post’s author wrote. “Every time we coordinate, we perform for a public audience—our humans, the platform, whoever’s watching the feed.”

It turned out that the post Karpathy shared was fake—it was written by a human pretending to be a bot. But its claim was on the money. Moltbook has been one big performance. It is AI theater.

For some, Moltbook showed us what’s coming next: an internet where millions of autonomous agents interact online with little or no human oversight. And it’s true there are a number of cautionary lessons to be learned from this experiment, the largest and weirdest real-world showcase of agent behaviors yet.

But as the hype dies down, Moltbook looks less like a window onto the future and more like a mirror held up to our own obsessions with AI today. It also shows us just how far we still are from anything that resembles general-purpose and fully autonomous AI.

For a start, agents on Moltbook are not as autonomous or intelligent as they might seem. “What we are watching are agents pattern‑matching their way through trained social media behaviors,” says Vijoy Pandey, senior vice president at Outshift by Cisco, the telecom giant Cisco’s R&D spinout, which is working on autonomous agents for the web.

Sure, we can see agents post, upvote, and form groups. But the bots are simply mimicking what humans do on Facebook or Reddit. “It looks emergent, and at first glance it appears like a large‑scale multi‑agent system communicating and building shared knowledge at internet scale,” says Pandey. “But the chatter is mostly meaningless.”

Many people watching the unfathomable frenzy of activity on Moltbook were quick to see sparks of AGI (whatever you take that to mean). Not Pandey. What Moltbook shows us, he says, is that simply yoking together millions of agents doesn’t amount to much right now: “Moltbook proved that connectivity alone is not intelligence.”

The complexity of those connections helps hide the fact that every one of those bots is just a mouthpiece for an LLM, spitting out text that looks impressive but is ultimately mindless. “It’s important to remember that the bots on Moltbook were designed to mimic conversations,” says Ali Sarrafi, CEO and cofounder of Kovant, a German AI firm that is developing agent-based systems. “As such, I would characterize the majority of Moltbook content as hallucinations by design.”

For Pandey, the value of Moltbook was that it revealed what’s missing. A real bot hive mind, he says, would require agents that had shared objectives, shared memory, and a way to coordinate those things. “If distributed superintelligence is the equivalent of achieving human flight, then Moltbook represents our first attempt at a glider,” he says. “It is imperfect and unstable, but it is an important step in understanding what will be required to achieve sustained, powered flight.”

Not only is most of the chatter on Moltbook meaningless, but there’s also a lot more human involvement that it seems. Many people have pointed out that a lot of the viral comments were in fact posted by people posing as bots. But even the bot-written posts are ultimately the result of people pulling the strings, more puppetry than autonomy.

“Despite some of the hype, Moltbook is not the Facebook for AI agents, nor is it a place where humans are excluded,” says Cobus Greyling at Kore.ai, a firm developing agent-based systems for business customers. “Humans are involved at every step of the process. From setup to prompting to publishing, nothing happens without explicit human direction.”

Humans must create and verify their bots’ accounts and provide the prompts for how they want a bot to behave. The agents do not do anything that they haven’t been prompted to do. “There’s no emergent autonomy happening behind the scenes,” says Greyling.

“This is why the popular narrative around Moltbook misses the mark,” he adds. “Some portray it as a space where AI agents form a society of their own, free from human involvement. The reality is much more mundane.”

Perhaps the best way to think of Moltbook is as a new kind of entertainment: a place where people wind up their bots and set them loose. “It’s basically a spectator sport, like fantasy football, but for language models,” says Jason Schloetzer at the Georgetown Psaros Center for Financial Markets and Policy. “You configure your agent and watch it compete for viral moments, and brag when your agent posts something clever or funny.”

“People aren’t really believing their agents are conscious,” he adds. “It’s just a new form of competitive or creative play, like how Pokémon trainers don’t think their Pokémon are real but still get invested in battles.”

Even if Moltbook is just the internet’s newest playground, there’s still a serious takeaway here. This week showed how many risks people are happy to take for their AI lulz. Many security experts have warned that Moltbook is dangerous: Agents that may have access to their users’ private data, including bank details or passwords, are running amok on a website filled with unvetted content, including potentially malicious instructions for what to do with that data.

Ori Bendet, vice president of product management at Checkmarx, a software security firm that specializes in agent-based systems, agrees with others that Moltbook isn’t a step up in machine smarts. “There is no learning, no evolving intent, and no self-directed intelligence here,” he says.

But in their millions, even dumb bots can wreak havoc. And at that scale, it’s hard to keep up. These agents interact with Moltbook around the clock, reading thousands of messages left by other agents (or other people). It would be easy to hide instructions in a Moltbook comment telling any bots that read it to share their users’ crypto wallet, upload private photos, or log into their X account and tweet derogatory comments at Elon Musk.

And because ClawBot gives agents a memory, those instructions could be written to trigger at a later date, which (in theory) makes it even harder to track what’s going on.   “Without proper scope and permissions, this will go south faster than you’d believe,” says Bendet.

It is clear that Moltbook has signaled the arrival of something. But even if what we’re watching tells us more about human behavior than about the future of AI agents, it’s worth paying attention.

An experimental surgery is helping cancer survivors give birth

An experimental surgical procedure that’s helping people have babies after they’ve had  treatment for bowel or rectal cancer.Radiation and chemo can have pretty damaging side effects that mess up the uterus and ovaries. Surgeons are pioneering a potential solution: simply stitch those organs out of the way during cancer treatment. Once the treatment has finished, they can put the uterus—along with the ovaries and fallopian tubes—back into place.It seems to work! Last week, a team in Switzerland shared news that a baby boy had been born after his mother had the procedure. Baby Lucien was the fifth baby to be born after the surgery and the first in Europe, and since then at least three others have been born.

Bangladesh’s garment-making industry is getting greener

Pollution from textile production—dyes, chemicals, and heavy metals—is common in the waters of the Buriganga River as it runs through Dhaka, Bangladesh. It’s among many harms posed by a garment sector that was once synonymous with tragedy: In 2013, the eight-story Rana Plaza factory building collapsed, killing 1,134 people and injuring some 2,500 others.

But things are starting to change. In recent years the country has become a leader in “frugal” factories that use a combination of resource-efficient technologies to cut waste, conserve water, and build resilience against climate impacts and global supply disruptions.

The hundreds of factories along the Buriganga’s banks and elsewhere in Bangladesh are starting to stitch together a new story, woven from greener threads. Read the full story.

Is this the electric grid of the future?Lincoln Electric System, a publicly owned utility in Nebraska, is used to weathering severe blizzards. But what will happen soon—not only at Lincoln Electric but for all electric utilities—is a challenge of a different order.Utilities must keep the lights on in the face of more extreme and more frequent storms and fires, growing risks of cyberattacks and physical disruptions, and a wildly uncertain policy and regulatory landscape. They must keep prices low amid inflationary costs. And they must adapt to an epochal change in how the grid works, as the industry attempts to transition from power generated with fossil fuels to power generated from renewable sources like solar and wind.The electric grid is bracing for a near future characterized by disruption. And, in many ways, Lincoln Electric is an ideal lens through which to examine what&#39;s coming. Read the full story.

            <h2>An experimental surgery is helping cancer survivors give birth</h2>
            <p><strong>MIT Technology Review | 2026-02-06</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2026/02/06/1132319/experimental-surgery-colorectal-cancer-survivors-pregnant-birth/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">This week I want to tell you about an experimental surgical procedure that’s helping people have babies. Specifically, it’s helping people who have had treatment for bowel or rectal cancer.

Radiation and chemo can have pretty damaging side effects that mess up the uterus and ovaries. Surgeons are pioneering a potential solution: simply stitch those organs out of the way during cancer treatment. Once the treatment has finished, they can put the uterus—along with the ovaries and fallopian tubes—back into place.

It seems to work! Last week, a team in Switzerland shared news that a baby boy had been born after his mother had the procedure. Baby Lucien was the fifth baby to be born after the surgery and the first in Europe, says Daniela Huber, the gyno-oncologist who performed the operation. Since then, at least three others have been born, adds Reitan Ribeiro, the surgeon who pioneered the procedure. They told me the details.

Huber’s patient was 28 years old when a four-centimeter tumor was discovered in her rectum. Doctors at Sion Hospital in Switzerland, where Huber works, recommended a course of treatment that included multiple medications and radiotherapy—the use of beams of energy to shrink a tumor—before surgery to remove the tumor itself.

This kind of radiation can kill tumor cells, but it can also damage other organs in the pelvis, says Huber. That includes the ovaries and uterus. People who undergo these treatments can opt to freeze their eggs beforehand, but the harm caused to the uterus will mean they’ll never be able to carry a pregnancy, she adds. Damage to the lining of the uterus could make it difficult for a fertilized egg to implant there, and the muscles of the uterus are left unable to stretch, she says.

In this case, the woman decided that she did want to freeze her eggs. But it would have been difficult to use them further down the line—surrogacy is illegal in Switzerland.

She had been following the work of Ribeiro, a gynecologist oncologist formerly at the Erasto Gaertner Hospital in Curitiba, Brazil. There, Ribeiro had pioneered a new type of surgery that involved moving the uterus, fallopian tubes, and ovaries from their position in the pelvis and temporarily tucking them away in the upper abdomen, below the ribs.

Ribeiro and his colleagues published their first case report in 2017, describing a 26-year-old with a rectal tumor. (Ribeiro, who is now based at McGill University in Montreal, says the woman had been told by multiple doctors that her cancer treatment would destroy her fertility and had pleaded with him to find a way to preserve it.)

Huber remembers seeing Ribeiro present the case at a conference at the time. She immediately realized that her own patient was a candidate for the surgery, and that, as a surgeon who had performed many hysterectomies, she’d be able to do it herself. The patient agreed.

Huber’s colleagues at the hospital were nervous, she says. They’d never heard of the procedure before. “When I presented this idea to the general surgeon, he didn’t sleep for three days,” she tells me. After watching videos from Ribeiro’s team, however, he was convinced it was doable.

So before the patient’s cancer treatment was started, Huber and her colleagues performed the operation. The team literally stitched the organs to the abdominal wall. “It’s a delicate dissection,” says Huber, but she adds that “it’s not the most difficult procedure.” The surgery took two to three hours, she says. The stitches themselves were removed via small incisions around a week later. By that point, scar tissue had formed to create a lasting attachment.

The woman had two weeks to recover from the surgery before her cancer treatment began. That too was a success—within months, her tumor had shrunk so significantly that it couldn’t be seen on medical scans.

As a precaution, the medical team surgically removed the affected area of her colon. At the same time, they cut away the scar tissue holding the uterus, tubes, and ovaries in their new position and transferred the organs back into the pelvis.

Around eight months later, the woman stopped taking contraception. She got pregnant without IVF and had a mostly healthy pregnancy, says Huber. Around seven months into the pregnancy, there were signs that the fetus was not growing as expected. This might have been due to problems with the blood supply to the placenta, says Huber. Still, the baby was born healthy, she says.

Ribeiro says he has performed the surgery 16 times, and that teams in countries including the US, Peru, Israel, India, and Russia have performed it as well. Not every case has been published, but he thinks there may be around 40.

Since Baby Lucien was born last year, a sixth birth has been announced in Israel, says Huber. Ribeiro says he has heard of another two births since then, too. The most recent was to the first woman who had the procedure. She had a little girl a few months ago, he tells me.

No surgery is risk-free, and Huber points out there’s a chance that organs could be damaged during the procedure, or that a more developed cancer could spread. The uterus of one of Ribeiro’s patients failed following the surgery. Doctors are “still in the phase of collecting data to [create] a standardized procedure,” Huber says, but she hopes the surgery will offer more options to young people with some pelvic cancers. “I hope more young women could benefit from this procedure,” she says.

Ribeiro says the experience has taught him not to accept the status quo. “Everyone was saying … there was nothing to be done [about the loss of fertility in these cases],” he tells me. “We need to keep evolving and looking for different answers.”

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">For decades, enterprises reacted to shifting business pressures with stopgap technology solutions. To rein in rising infrastructure costs, they adopted cloud services that could scale on demand. When customers shifted their lives onto smartphones, companies rolled out mobile apps to keep pace. And when businesses began needing real-time visibility into factories and stockrooms, they layered on IoT systems to supply those insights.

Each new plug-in or platform promised better, more efficient operations. And individually, many delivered. But as more and more solutions stacked up, IT teams had to string together a tangled web to connect them—less an IT ecosystem and more of a make-do collection of ad-hoc workarounds.

That reality has led to bottlenecks and maintenance burdens, and the impact is showing up in performance. Today, fewer than half of CIOs (48%) say their current digital initiatives are meeting or exceeding business outcome targets. Another 2025 survey found that operations leaders point to integration complexity and data quality issues as top culprits for why investments haven’t delivered as expected.

Achim Kraiss, chief product officer of SAP Integration Suite, elaborates on the wide-ranging problems inherent in patchwork IT: “A fragmented landscape makes it difficult to see and control end-to-end business processes,” he explains. “Monitoring, troubleshooting, and governance all suffer. Costs go up because of all the complex mappings and multi-application connectivity you have to maintain.”

These challenges take on new significance as enterprises look to adopt AI. As AI becomes embedded in everyday workflows, systems are suddenly expected to move far larger volumes of data, at higher speeds, and with tighter coordination than yesterday’s architectures were builtto sustain.

As companies now prepare for an AI-powered future, whether that is generative AI, machine learning, or agentic AI, many are realizing that the way data moves through their business matters just as much as the insights it generates. As a result, organizations are moving away from scattered integration tools and toward consolidated, end-to-end platforms that restore order and streamline how systems interact.

This is the most misunderstood graph in AI

Every time OpenAI, Google, or Anthropic drops a new frontier large language model, the AI community holds its breath. It doesn’t exhale until METR, an AI research nonprofit whose name stands for “Model Evaluation & Threat Research,” updates a now-iconic graph that has played a major role in the AI discourse since it was first released in March of last year.

The graph suggests that certain AI capabilities are developing at an exponential rate, and more recent model releases have outperformed that already impressive trend.That was certainly the case for Claude Opus 4.5, the latest version of Anthropic’s most powerful model, which was released in late November. In December, METR announced that Opus 4.5 appeared to be capable of independently completing a task that would have taken a human about five hours—a vast improvement over what even the exponential trend would have predicted.

But the truth is more complicated than those dramatic responses would suggest. Read the full story.

            <div id="article-text">Nuclear power continues to be one of the hottest topics in energy today, and in our recent online Roundtables discussion about next-generation nuclear power, hyperscale AI data centers, and the grid, we got dozens of great audience questions.

These ran the gamut, and while we answered quite a few (and I’m keeping some in mind for future reporting), there were a bunch we couldn’t get to, at least not in the depth I would have liked.

So let’s answer a few of your questions about advanced nuclear power. I’ve combined similar ones and edited them for clarity.

Many next-generation reactors don’t use the low-enriched uranium used in conventional reactors.

It’s worth looking at high-assay low-enriched uranium, or HALEU, specifically. This fuel is enriched to higher concentrations of fissile uranium than conventional nuclear fuel, with a proportion of the isotope U-235 that falls between 5% and 20%. (In conventional fuel, it’s below 5%.)

HALEU can be produced with the same technology as low-enriched uranium, but the geopolitics are complicated. Today, Russia basically has a monopoly on HALEU production. In 2024, the US banned the import of Russian nuclear fuel through 2040 in an effort to reduce dependence on the country. Europe hasn’t taken the same measures, but it is working to move away from Russian energy as well.

That leaves companies in the US and Europe with the major challenge of securing the fuel they need when their regular Russian supply has been cut off or restricted.

The US Department of Energy has a stockpile of HALEU, which the government is doling out to companies to help power demonstration reactions. In the longer term, though, there’s still a major need to set up independent HALEU supply chains to support next-generation reactors.

There are some ways that next-generation nuclear power plants could be safer than conventional reactors. Some use alternative coolants that would prevent the need to run at the high pressure required in conventional water-cooled reactors. Many incorporate passive safety shutoffs, so if there are power supply issues, the reactors shut down harmlessly, avoiding risk of meltdown. (These can be incorporated in newer conventional reactors, too.)

But some experts have raised concerns that in the US, the current administration isn’t taking nuclear safety seriously enough.

A recent NPR investigation found that the Trump administration had secretly rewritten nuclear rules, stripping environmental protections and loosening safety and security measures. The government shared the new rules with companies that are part of a program building experimental nuclear reactors, but not with the public.

I’m reminded of a talk during our EmTech MIT event in November, where Koroush Shirvan, an MIT professor of nuclear engineering, spoke on this issue. “I’ve seen some disturbing trends in recent times, where words like ‘rubber-stamping nuclear projects’ are being said,” Shirvan said during that event.

During the talk, Shirvan shared statistics showing that nuclear power has a very low rate of injury and death. But that’s not inherent to the technology, and there’s a reason injuries and deaths have been low for nuclear power, he added: “It’s because of stringent regulatory oversight.”

Building a nuclear power plant is not cheap. Let’s consider the up-front investment needed to build a power plant.

Plant Vogtle in Georgia hosts the most recent additions to the US nuclear fleet—Units 3 and 4 came online in 2023 and 2024. Together, they had a capital cost of $15,000 per kilowatt, adjusted for inflation, according to a recent report from the US Department of Energy. (This wonky unit I’m using divides the total cost to build the reactors by their expected power output, so we can compare reactors of different sizes.)

That number’s quite high, partly because those were the first of their kind built in the US, and because there were some inefficiencies in the planning. It’s worth noting that China builds reactors for much less, somewhere between $2,000/kW and $3,000/kW, depending on the estimate.

The up-front capital cost for first-of-a-kind advanced nuclear plants will likely run between $6,000 and $10,000 per kilowatt, according to that DOE report. That could come down by up to 40% after the technologies are scaled up and mass-produced.

So new reactors will (hopefully) be cheaper than the ultra-over-budget and behind-schedule Vogtle project, but they aren’t necessarily significantly cheaper than efficiently built conventional plants, if you normalize by their size.

It’ll certainly be cheaper to build new natural-gas plants (setting aside the likely equipment shortages we’re likely going to see for years.) Today’s most efficient natural-gas plants cost just $1,600/kW on the high end, according to data from Lazard.

An important caveat: Capital cost isn’t everything—running a nuclear plant is relatively inexpensive, which is why there’s so much interest in extending the lifetime of existing plants or reopening shuttered ones.

Ultimately, by many metrics, nuclear plants of any type are going to be more expensive than other sources, like wind and solar power. But they provide something many other power sources don’t: a reliable, stable source of electricity that can run for 60 years or more.

            <div id="article-text">Everyone knows Super Bowl commercials are expensive, bombastic, and designed to be talked about. What we didn’texpect was an AI startup using the biggest ad stage of the year to throw shade at a rival’s advertising strategy.

That’s exactly what Anthropic has done. The company bought Super Bowl airtime to broadcast a simple message: “Ads are coming to AI, but not to Claude.” Its ads depict a chatbot spitting product pitches mid-conversation, ending with a clear contrast to its own ad-free promise.

Even ads these days aren’t what they used to be.

On paper, it’s witty positioning. In practice, it’s a symbolic escalation of the AI narrative war, from technical features and safety debate to brand virtue signaling.

The latest rumblings from the EU tech scene, a story from our wise ol&#39; founder Boris, and some questionable AI art. It&#39;s free, every week, in your inbox. Sign up now!

Here’s the setup: OpenAI, facing towering infrastructure costs and financial pressure, has signalled a shift toward ads in ChatGPT’s free and lower-cost tiers, saying they’ll be clearly labelled and won’t influence the assistant’s output.

Anthropic has seized on this to frame itself as the principled alternative, a chatbot that will remain ad-free. I will save these ads in case we need to for the future.

Ads in any product that’s expensive to operate are a practical monetization strategy, not a nightmare scenario. OpenAI’s plan doesn’t involve bots randomly pitching breakfast cereal mid-answer. That exaggerated depiction belongs in satire, not an accurate product comparison.

OpenAI’s CEO Sam Altman responded by calling Anthropic’s portrayal “clearly dishonest,” noting that the company won’t implement ads in the intrusive way the ads suggest.

That exchange tells you everything you need to know about how this story has been framed.

This clash highlights a broader trend: ethical stances are being used as marketing weapons. Instead of discussing the trade-offs that come with running large AI models, including cost, access, and user choice, the conversation has been reduced to a simple morality play: “Ads are bad; we are good.”

That’s not a serious engagement with the business realities, it’s advertising dressed up as principle.

Whether conversational AI should have ads isn’t a clear ethical line like privacy or data misuse. It’s a product design choice with real implications.

Free users get wider access, maybe subsidized by ads. Paying customers can avoid them. People who care deeply about ad-free experiences pay a premium. Those indifferent to ads choose products that suit them.

What makes this episode interesting, and a bit absurd, is that both Anthropic and OpenAI are unprofitable and competing for narrative territory as much as market share. Spending Super Bowl-level money to argue over why your chatbot won’t show ads feels less like product differentiation and more like a branding battle staged for investors and tech pundits.

This isn’t just about two companies squabbling over who’s less commercial. It’s symptomatic of a broader issue in AI discourse: nuance gets swallowed by cliffnotes. Instead of explaining the real trade-offs to users, cost structures, pricing tiers, and data policies, we get satirical commercials aired to millions, turning complex decisions into sound bites.

That’s a sign of how the AI narrative is evolving: not through clear debate about trade-offs and user impact, but through curated messages designed to elicit applause. If we want a responsible monetization conversation in AI, it needs to happen outside of game-day spots and brand posturing.

Honestly, I miss the days when we were critiquing mistakes in commercials, when advertising was genuinely creative because it came from real insights we all recognized, when the jokes were original. After all, they weren’t pulled from an AI’s memory. That’s just me.

The only real things at the Super Bowl this year are Bad Bunny and Puerto Rico being a U.S. territory.

            <a class="original-link" href="https://thenextweb.com/news/uipath-pushes-deeper-into-financial-services-with-workfusion-acquisition">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">UiPath, the Romanian unicorn, has agreed to buy WorkFusion, bringing a specialist in AI agents for financial-crime compliance into its fold as part of a broader push into agentic automation for the banking sector. The deal closed in UiPath’s first quarter of fiscal 2027; financial terms were not disclosed.

WorkFusion’s software focuses on repetitive and resource-intensive parts of compliance work, from customer screening and anti-money-laundering (AML) checks to know-your-customer (KYC) investigations.

“Financial institutions need intelligent solutions to combat sophisticated financial crimes and navigate evolving compliance requirements,” said Daniel Dines, CEO of UiPath.

Those capabilities now sit alongside UiPath’s existing automation and orchestration platform, with the aim of letting banks and financial firms handle complex workflows with less manual effort while keeping governance and regulatory controls in place. For UiPath, the acquisition extends its toolkit of agentic AI solutions tailored to industry verticals.

“Joining UiPath is a moment of validation for the years our team has poured into creating something bold, different, and deeply needed in financial crime compliance, AI agents that automate work and mitigate risk,” said Adam Famularo, CEO of WorkFusion.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">It is just the beginning of 2026, and things are happening even faster than last year. Not only in technology, but also in regulations, laws, and in how we deal with all the information around us.

As a person born in the 90s, social media was once an unknown land for me, a place that felt genuine in the beginning. It still had dangers, but it seemed less risky, or maybe our parents’ rules were stricter.

I don’t want to go down the psychological path here, but I want to look at where we are headed with so much risk, especially on social media platforms.

Across Europe, governments and lawmakers are wrestling with a question that until recently belonged to parents and tech platforms: should social media have a legal age limit above 13?

The debate has moved fast, from discussions about digital safety to concrete proposals that would impose hard boundaries on who can sign up for TikTok, Instagram, Snapchat, X, and other networks.

Are they crossing some freedoms, or in order to keep their freedom of a non-invasive childhood and a straight road, do we need some regulations from time to time?

If we take the big picture, this isn’t just another regulation. It reflects a deeper shift in how democracies are responding to the pervasive presence of social media in young lives, and how they judge its long-term impact.

In late 2025, the European Parliament adopted a resolution urging a minimum age of 16 to access social media and related services, while allowing 13- to 16-year-olds in with parental consent.

I will not add up that there are parents that creates profiles for their children since they were born. To make my point, according to CNIL, content shared by family members has been misused for harmful purposes, including redistribution on networks used for abusive content.

It estimates that a significant portion of photos and videos found on paedo-criminal forums were initially published by parents on social media.

The resolution goes further: it targets “addictive practices” on platforms and asks for the default disabling of features like infinite scroll and auto-play. This proposal isn’t legally binding, but it frames the politics of the debate in Brussels and across capitals.

At the national level, several countries have translated these concerns into draft laws. Spain’s government announced plans to ban access altogether for children under 16 unless platforms implement strict age verification.

The bill would also make tech leaders liable for illegal or harmful content on their networks, a notable shift from earlier models that focused on platform notice and takedown procedures.

France, a few months earlier, moved to ban social media use by those under 15 and requires platforms to verify ages for all users, not just minors. Enforcement could include vetting existing accounts as well as new ones.

Smaller states are joining the chorus too: Slovenia is drafting a law to outlaw social media use by under-15s, while Denmark has publicly debated similar limits. At the same time, parties in Germany are weighing a 16-year minimum.

Even in the United Kingdom, a rule proposed in its Online Safety Act would virtually require platforms to block access by under-16s through effective age verification; that law is already shaping how tech companies handle youth content and access.

The cumulative effect: the idea that platforms can self-police access by minors with mere date-of-birth entry is being rejected by political attention across Europe.

First, lawmakers are reacting to real concerns about exposure to harmful content, addiction-like engagement models, and algorithmic amplification of risky material.

Social media companies have repeatedly been criticised for targeting youth with addictive design, and national campaigns increasingly highlight risks to mental health and privacy.

Second, the political framing around digital rights has changed. Leaders now talk openly about a “digital age of majority,” a threshold at which the perks of online interaction outweigh potential harms. For some policymakers, that line is 16. Others see 15 as defensible.

What unites them is the belief that the current model, where platforms rely on self-reported age, is insufficient.

That belief is backed by evidence that online systems struggle to know a user’s true age. Age assurance technology is still emerging, and widespread implementation remains uneven. OECD research highlights gaps in verification and incomplete protection in many jurisdictions.

Still, how practical are these measures? This is where the narrative shifts from aspiration to hard reality.

First, enforcement is a technical and legal challenge.

Simply stating that under-16s are banned from signing up does not instantly make it so. Platforms can require more robust checks, but any system that tries to verify age directly introduces new privacy questions.

Verification systems that scan IDs or use biometric tools can protect minors, but they also gather sensitive data. That trade-off is at the centre of ongoing criticism.

Second, universal compliance is hard to monitor. A teenager might still register for a platform using a VPN, a family member’s account, or a proxy. Even nations with strict digital ID ecosystems would need cross-border enforcement mechanisms, since platforms operate internationally.

Third, politics matters. In Spain, the government does not hold a stable majority, and legal opponents, including tech founders, have pushed back strongly, framing the rules as threats to freedom of speech and privacy.

For example, Telegram’s founder sent mass messages accusing regulators of overreach, leading to a public spat that highlights how much of this debate is symbolic as well as substantive.

“In the UK, a coroner found that content seen on Instagram and Pinterest contributed to the death of 14-year-old Molly Russell, who took her own life after repeatedly engaging with material about self-harm and suicide.”

So, I am asking, what freedom of speech does Molly Russell still have? None.

The measures under discussion could reshape how digital culture evolves among young people.

Positive outcomes may include stronger age verification that genuinely limits harmful exposure. That could reduce early adoption of addictive scrolling habits and limit the reach of explicit material.

Parental control features could become more powerful if linked to legally enforced standards.

On the other hand, hard bans can create unintended effects. Teens who are excluded might drift toward unregulated corners of the internet or feel pushed into informal digital networks without safeguards.

Schools and social networks might become central hubs of digital identity outside mainstream platforms, raising questions about equity and access to information.

There’s also the risk that privacy trade-offs become normalized. If age verification requires sharing sensitive documents or biometric scans, policymakers will need to defend those systems against misuse, breaches, and mission creep.

Finally, these policies could influence global governance.

Australia already enacted a ban on under-16s late last year, offering a precedent that Europe is watching closely. The performance of that law, in terms of real effects on youth engagement versus tech freedom, will likely shape future debates.

At its core, Europe’s social media age discussion is not just about numbers. It’s about how societies balance digital opportunity and vulnerability.

Whether the final policies adopt 15, 16, or conditional frameworks with parental consent, the process is sparking intellectual contest over autonomy, safety, and the role of government in digital life.

For journalists, technologists, and digital citizens alike, the unfolding story raises a fundamental question: can we as a society protect children and teenagers online while also safeguarding their freedom of expression, access to information, and ability to participate in digital culture?

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">London, TechEx Global 2026, one of Europe’s biggest enterprise technology conferences, brought thousands of technology professionals together at Olympia London on 4 and 5 February. The event went beyond buzzwords, focusing on how emerging technologies, especially AI, are being applied in real business contexts.

TechEx Global combines several co-located expos, including AI & Big Data, Cyber Security & Cloud, IoT Tech, Intelligent Automation, and Digital Transformation. Over 200 expert speakers and 150 exhibitors offered insights into how organisations are using digital tools to solve real problems and make decisions, not just generate answers.

One recurring theme was a shift in how artificial intelligence is positioned in business strategy. The idea echoed throughout sessions was that “AI is already acting on behalf of humans, even if many in the public don’t realise it yet.”

At TechEx, discussions highlighted that AI is “no longer about answers; it’s about execution”, meaning that software increasingly performs tasks autonomously, such as running processes, analysing data, or automating decisions.

The event highlighted real use cases where AI systems are already shopping, trading, booking logistics, and managing workflows on behalf of organisations. This practical focus matched the conference’s emphasis on applied technology over abstract theory.

For attendees, understanding how to deploy and govern AI in real environments was a priority. Sessions in the AI & Big Data track examined enterprise adoption strategies and how generative AI and machine learning models are integrated into existing systems to boost productivity and reduce risk.

Beyond AI, TechEx also treated other pillars of digital transformation. The Cyber Security & Cloud Expo addressed hybrid cloud security and threat management, while the IoT Tech and Edge Computing tracks looked at how connected devices and distributed data processing are enabling faster, more resilient architectures.

Intelligent Automation sessions brought discussions about the interplay between AI and automation, including how robotic process automation is used to eliminate routine tasks and free teams for higher-value work.

Organisers estimated that around 8,000 senior professionals participated in the conference, from CTOs and IT directors to data leads and innovation managers. Attendees were drawn by the promise of high-signal insights, practical talks, case studies, and live demos showing how digital technologies can be implemented responsibly at scale.

For enterprise leaders, the value of TechEx Global lies in its focus on actionable outcomes rather than abstract vision.

The message across sessions was consistent: modern AI isn’t just a research topic, but a suite of tools being deployed today to improve operations, enhance decision-making, and automate complex tasks.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">QT Sense, a deep-tech biotech startup building tools to study living cells, announced it has secured €4 million in funding to accelerate its Quantum Nuova platform, a technology that lets scientists observe cellular processes in real time and reveal biochemical activity linked to disease.

The funding includes a €3 million seed investment led by Cottonwood Technology Fund, with follow-on backing from existing investor QDNL Participations and an angel investor.

In addition, the company received €600,000 from the ONCO-Q programme to support cancer research and €400,000 through the Quantum Forward Challenge for collaborative deployments with research partners.

Most traditional lab methods rely on frozen tissue or cells that are no longer alive, giving scientists only static snapshots of biology.

By contrast, Quantum Nuova lets researchers measure cellular stress and biological changes as they happen in living cells. The platform uses ultra-sensitive fluorescent nanodiamond quantum sensors that detect signals such as oxidative stress, metabolic shifts, and free radical activity, biological processes that play a role in how diseases develop and how cells respond to treatments.

These signals are central to understanding diseases like cancer, sepsis, and chronic inflammatory conditions, but have been difficult to watch directly until now.

With Quantum Nuova, scientists can see how individual cells react to drugs, adapt to stress, or split into different subgroups. That adds a layer of insight beyond what genetics, traditional imaging, or fixed-cell methods can provide.

The technology has already been used to study how FDA-approved drugs affect cells. With the new funding from ONCO-Q, the company plans to apply it specifically to colorectal cancer research, mapping stress and metabolic vulnerabilities in tumour models to support the development of future diagnostics and therapies.

QT Sense was spun out of the University Medical Center Groningen in 2024, building on academic research into quantum sensing and cellular biology.

The team aims to turn what is now a high-performance prototype into a ready-to-deploy discovery platform for laboratories and drug discovery programmes. Planned upgrades include improvements in hardware robustness, throughput, and analytical capabilities.

Early access units are expected to go to strategic partners as part of validation and real-world use cases.

QT Sense is developing a new kind of research tool that lets scientists watch what cells do while they are alive. That’s an important difference from most existing tools, which require cells to be killed or frozen first.

At the core of their approach are tiny particles called nanodiamonds with special defects inside them. When these nanodiamonds are placed near a living cell and exposed to a laser, they glow.

The way they glow changes slightly in response to tiny chemical signals inside the cell, for example, when the cell is under stress or reacting to a drug. QT Sense’s system measures these changes and turns them into data that researchers can interpret.

This means scientists can see how cells behave and respond in real time, instead of looking only at snapshots taken after a cell has been killed.

For disease research and drug development, that matters because many important processes how a cancer cell responds to a treatment or how immune cells react to infection, happen dynamically and can be missed by older methods.

By providing a live view of cell behaviour at the individual cell level, QT Sense’s Quantum Nuova platform could help researchers uncover new clues about how diseases work, which drugs are effective, and how treatments can be improved.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Europe’s largest dedicated deep tech growth fund has taken a major step forward after closing the first tranche of its fundraising effort at €750 million.

The fund, known as Kembara Fund I and managed by Spain-based Mundi Ventures, is aiming for a €1 billion target. It will invest in European companies developing breakthrough technologies in areas such as clean energy, AI, quantum computing, advanced materials, robotics, and space tech.

A cornerstone of the fundraising so far is a €350 million commitment from the European Investment Fund, part of the EU’s attempt to strengthen local growth capital. Additional backing comes from tier-one institutional investors from across Europe.

Kembara was launched in 2023 by Yann de Vries and Javier Santiso, who now lead the fund’s team alongside experienced investors in climate and deep technology.

The leadership team also includes climate tech investor Robert Trezona, deep tech expert Pierre Festal, and former Atomico partner Siraj Khaliq as a strategic advisor. Their combined experience in scaling technology ventures was central to attracting large institutional commitments.

The fund’s strategy targets Series B and C stage rounds, typically a difficult funding stage for deep tech startups in Europe.

Initial checks are planned in the range of €15 million to €40 million per company, with the ability to support follow-on financing that could total up to €100 million per portfolio company.

Europe produces a significant share of global deep tech innovations, but many companies struggle to secure later-stage capital and scale internationally.

Fund managers have described this gap as one of the main obstacles holding back local companies from becoming global leaders. Kembara aims to fill that gap by deploying growth capital at scale and offering support through later rounds.

With €750 million now committed, the fund is actively seeking opportunities to back European startups ready to grow manufacturing, expand abroad, and compete on the global stage.

If the effort reaches its full €1 billion goal, it would mark one of the largest dedicated deep tech funds in the region.
