            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The Helix Nebula is one of the most well-known and commonly photographed planetary nebulae because it resembles the “Eye of Sauron.” It is also one of the closest bright nebulae to Earth, located approximately 655 light-years from our Solar System.

You may not know what this particular nebula looks like when reading its name, but the Hubble Space Telescope has taken some iconic images of it over the years. And almost certainly, you’ll recognize a photograph of the Helix Nebula, shown below.

Like many objects in astronomy, planetary nebulae have a confusing name, since they are formed not by planets but by stars like our own Sun, though a little larger. Near the end of their lives, these stars shed large amounts of gas in an expanding shell that, however briefly in cosmological time, put on a grand show.

Now the James Webb Space Telescope has turned its sights on the Helix Nebula, and, oh my, does it have a story to tell. NASA released the new images of the nebula on Tuesday.

In this image, there are vibrant pillars of gas along the inner region of the nebula’s expanding shell of gas. According to the space agency, this is what we’re seeing:

A blazing white dwarf, the leftover core of the dying star, lies right at the heart of the nebula, out of the frame of the Webb image. Its intense radiation lights up the surrounding gas, creating a rainbow of features: hot ionized gas closest to the white dwarf, cooler molecular hydrogen farther out, and protective pockets where more complex molecules can begin to form within dust clouds. This interaction is vital, as it’s the raw material from which new planets may one day form in other star systems.

In Webb’s image of the Helix Nebula, color represents the temperature and chemistry. A touch of a blue hue marks the hottest gas in this field, energized by intense ultraviolet light from the white dwarf. Farther out, the gas cools into the yellow regions where hydrogen atoms join into molecules. At the outer edges, the reddish tones trace the coolest material, where gas begins to thin and dust can take shape. Together, the colors show the star’s final breath transforming into the raw ingredients for new worlds, adding to the wealth of knowledge gained from Webb about the origin of planets.</div>

            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-01-20</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2026/01/zuck-stuck-on-trumps-bad-side-ftc-appeals-loss-in-meta-monopoly-case/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Still feeling uneasy about Meta’s acquisition of Instagram in 2012 and WhatsApp in 2014, the Federal Trade Commission will be appealing a November ruling that cleared Meta of allegations that it holds an illegal monopoly in a market dubbed “personal social networking.”

The FTC hopes the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia will agree that “robust evidence at trial” showed that Meta’s acquisitions were improper. In the initial trial, the FTC sought a breakup of Meta’s apps, with Meta risking forced divestments of Instagram or WhatsApp.

In a press release Tuesday, the FTC confirmed that it “continues to allege” that “for over a decade Meta has illegally maintained a monopoly in personal social networking services through anticompetitive conduct—by buying the significant competitive threats it identified in Instagram and WhatsApp.”

Talking to press, FTC spokesperson Joe Simonson pointed out that the case against Meta originated during Donald Trump’s prior term, Reuters reported. Back then, Trump was frustrated with Facebook, claiming the company and its CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, were “anti-Trump” in 2017, the BBC reported. His frustrations only grew when Meta banned his Facebook and Instagram accounts in 2021.

Ahead of Trump’s second term, Zuckerberg has attempted to improve relations with Trump, donating $1 million to Trump’s inauguration fund in a move the BBC reported was intended to “repair his and his firm’s relationship with Trump.” Last January, Meta also paid Trump $25 million to settle lawsuits over his Facebook and Instagram suspensions, NPR reported.

But these moves have seemingly not affected the FTC’s resolve to undo Meta’s alleged monopoly. On Tuesday, Simonson said the Meta crackdown remained a priority because the agency believes that “Meta violated our antitrust laws when it acquired Instagram and WhatsApp,” and “consequently, American consumers have suffered from Meta’s monopoly.”

For Meta, the renewed fight comes at a time when most tech companies are walking tightropes to avoid any possible retaliation from Trump, not just social platforms. After defeating the FTC last fall, Meta’s chief legal officer, Jennifer Newstead, didn’t dunk on the FTC but coolly celebrated the ruling for recognizing that “Meta faces fierce competition.” In the same breath, Newstead also seemed to want to take the opportunity to remind the Trump administration that Meta was a friend.

“Our products are beneficial for people and businesses and exemplify American innovation and economic growth,” Newstead said. “We look forward to continuing to partner with the Administration and to invest in America.”

Similarly, this week, Meta has offered a rather neutral response to the FTC’s announcement. Asked for comment on the FTC’s decision to appeal, Meta’s spokesperson simply told Ars that James Boasberg, the US district judge who sided with Meta, got it right the first time, then repeated one of Trump’s favorite refrains from tech companies.

“The District Court’s decision to reject the FTC’s arguments is correct and recognizes the fierce competition we face,” Meta’s spokesperson said. “We will remain focused on innovating and investing in America.”

Political tensions have remained at the center of the case, perhaps peaking after Boasberg’s ruling.

In November, Simonson criticized Boasberg, telling CNBC that “the deck was always stacked against us with Judge Boasberg, who is currently facing articles of impeachment.”

That push to impeach Boasberg came from Republican lawmaker Brandon Gill, who alleged the judge was abusing his power to censor conservatives, but no actions have been taken since the proposed resolution was submitted to a House committee that month. Republicans, including Trump’s attorney general Pam Bondi, have complained that Boasberg is a rogue partisan judge, but Boasberg so far has withstood their attacks while continuing to settle cases. Trump’s Truth Social tirades against the judge required a long fact-checking piece from PBS.

But the Meta case itself may be hard to win even with a judge that Republicans favor. Last year, the FTC had tried to argue that Meta faced no real competition in the personal social networking market, with only two rivals to speak of, Snapchat and an app called MeWe. But for social media users, Instagram and TikTok are interchangeable, Meta successfully argued, and that makes TikTok as much a rival as Snapchat, Boasberg agreed.

Additionally, Boasberg was not sold on the FTC’s argument that Meta was allegedly abusing its monopoly power and harming consumers by degrading the quality of the app while increasing ad loads. Rather, he agreed with Meta that the company had added many features “continuously” improving its apps.

Further, social media has changed so much since the days of Facebook competing for user engagement with Instagram that Boasberg emphasized that “the Court finds it impossible to believe that consumers would prefer the versions of Instagram and Facebook that existed a decade ago to the versions that exist today.”

As the FTC revives the case, a new judge will weigh Meta’s arguments, the general thrust of which is that social networking as it was known in the early days of Facebook is dead, making the FTC’s case moot.

It’s unclear whether a different judge will see Meta as a monopolist or if Boasberg was right to conclude that the days of grouping apps into “separate markets of social networking and social media” are over.</div>

            <h2>Verizon starts requiring 365 days of paid service before it will unlock phones</h2>
            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-01-20</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2026/01/verizon-starts-requiring-365-days-of-paid-service-before-it-will-unlock-phones/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Verizon has started enforcing a 365-day lock period on phones purchased through its TracFone division, one week after the Federal Communications Commission waived a requirement that Verizon unlock handsets 60 days after they are activated on its network.

Verizon was previously required to unlock phones automatically after 60 days due to restrictions imposed on its spectrum licenses and merger conditions that helped Verizon obtain approval of its purchase of TracFone. But an update applied today to the TracFone unlocking policy said new phones will be locked for at least a year and that each customer will have to request an unlock instead of getting it automatically.

The “new” TracFone policy is basically a return to the yearlong locking it imposed before Verizon bought the company in 2021. TracFone first agreed to provide unlocking in a 2015 settlement with the Obama-era FCC, which alleged that TracFone failed to comply with a commitment to unlock phones for customers enrolled in the Lifeline subsidy program. TracFone later shortened the locking period from a year to 60 days as a condition of the Verizon merger.

While a locked phone is tied to the network of one carrier, an unlocked phone can be switched to another carrier if the device is compatible with the other carrier’s network. But the new TracFone unlocking policy is stringent, requiring customers to pay for a full year of service before they can get a phone unlocked.

“For all cellphones Activated on or after January 20, 2026, the cellphone will be unlocked upon request after 365 days of paid and active service,” the policy says. A customer who doesn’t maintain an active service plan for the whole 12 months will thus have their unlocking eligibility date delayed.

Besides TracFone, the change applies to prepaid brands Straight Talk, Net10 Wireless, Clearway, Total Wireless, Simple Mobile, SafeLink Wireless, and Walmart Family Mobile. Customers who bought phones before today are still eligible for unlocks after 60 days.

As DroidLife points out, the Verizon-owned prepaid brand Visible is also requiring a year of paid service. The Visible policy updated today requires “at least 365 days of paid service” for an unlocking request. “If you stop paying for service, your progress toward the 365-day requirement pauses. It will resume once you reactivate your account and continue until you reach a total of 365 paid days of service,” the policy says.

The unlocking policy for Verizon-branded phones has not been updated since May 2025. The policy calls for phones to be unlocked automatically after 60 days of paid service, but it will probably be changed soon because of the FCC waiver.

Once updated, the primary Verizon policy will presumably match the TracFone subsidiary’s 365-day locking period, or at least require something longer than 60 days. It’s also likely to require customers to request an unlock since the FCC no longer requires Verizon to unlock phones automatically. We contacted Verizon about its plans today and will update this article if it provides a response.

AT&T’s policy allows unlocking of phones on postpaid plans after 60 days if the device has been paid in full, or after six months for phones on prepaid plans. T-Mobile’s policy allows unlocking of phones on postpaid plans after 40 days if the device has been paid in full, or after 365 days for phones on prepaid plans.

Verizon and FCC Chairman Brendan Carr have justified longer locking periods as a method of deterring fraud. When approving Verizon’s waiver request, the Carr FCC said the Verizon rule “required one wireless carrier to unlock their handsets well earlier than standard industry practice, thus creating an incentive for bad actors to steal those handsets for purposes of carrying out fraud and other illegal acts.”

Consumer advocacy groups disputed the argument, telling the FCC that “Verizon offers no specific evidence that a longer lock period would have prevented the fraudulent acquisition of the devices it identifies,” and that Verizon is capable of detecting and responding to fraud within 60 days of a phone’s activation. Consumers and small carriers will be hurt by the decision, the groups told the FCC, saying that automatic unlocking “facilitates the resale and reuse of mobile devices, reduces e-waste, and enables low-cost carriers and MVNOs to compete on a more level playing field.”

While the Biden-era FCC’s leadership criticized yearlong locking periods and proposed a 60-day unlocking requirement for all carriers, the Trump FCC appears likely to write a new industry-wide standard that would be welcomed by large mobile carriers. The FCC rejected a request to limit Verizon’s locking period to 180 days, and said the Verizon waiver will stay in effect until the agency “decides on an appropriate industry-wide approach for the unlocking of handsets.”</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">YouTubers have been increasingly frustrated with Google’s management of the platform, with disinformation welcomed back and an aggressive push for more AI (except where Google doesn’t like it). So it’s no surprise that creators have been up in arms over the suspicious removal of YouTube’s advanced SRV3 caption format. You don’t have to worry too much just yet—Google says this is only temporary, and it’s working on a fix for the underlying bug.

Google added support for this custom subtitle format around 2018, giving creators more customization options than with traditional captions. SRV3 (also known as YTT or YouTube Timed Text) allows for custom colors, transparency, animations, fonts, and precise positioning in videos. Uploaders using this format can color-code and position captions to help separate multiple speakers, create sing-along animations, or style them to match the video.

Over the last several days, creators who’ve become accustomed to this level of control have been dismayed to see that YouTube is no longer accepting videos with this Google-created format. Many worried Google had ditched the format entirely, which could be problematic for all those previously uploaded videos.

Google has now posted a brief statement and confirmed to Ars that it has not ended support for SRV3. However, all is not well. The company says it has temporarily limited the serving of SRV3 caption files because they may break playback for some users. That’s pretty vague, but it sounds like developers made a change to the platform without taking into account how it might interfere with SRV3 captions. Rather than allow those videos to be non-functional, it’s disabling most of the captions.

Google’s forum post says that while SRV3 is disabled, creators will not be able to upload new SRV3 captions. Videos that already have them may not show any captions until the feature is restored. However, Google notes most uploaders use other caption formats and are not affected by the playback bug.

Interestingly, Google also notes that the changes should be temporary for almost all videos. That implies some features of SRV3 may not be fully supported with whatever Google is doing on the back end. The company makes no promises about a timeline to re-enable SRV3—creators who have relied heavily on it may have to go back and re-create their captions in less capable formats or simply rely on AI-generated captions in the meantime.

Regardless of whether Google knew this would happen, it shouldn’t have left the community to stew about it for a week. This also suggests Google isn’t very serious about supporting its in-house CC format, which it has opted not to officially document. Creators should probably factor that into their future plans.</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued a health alert to clinicians Tuesday, warning that the savage, flesh-eating parasitic fly—the New World Screwworm—is not only approaching the Texas border, but also felling an increasing number of animals in the bordering Mexican state of Tamaulipas.

The advisory, released through the agency’s Health Alert Network, directs doctors, veterinarians, and other health workers to be on the lookout for patients with wounds teeming with ferocious maggots burrowing into their living flesh. The alert also provides guidance on what to do if any such festering wounds are encountered—namely, remove each and every maggot to prevent the patient from dying, and, under no circumstance allow any of the parasites to survive and escape.

The New World Screwworm (NWS) is a fly that lays its eggs—up to 400 at a time—in the wounds, orifices, and mucus membranes of any warm-blooded animal. The eggs hatch into flesh-eating maggots, which look and act much like screws, twisting and boring into their victims while eating them alive.

While the flies are indiscriminate killers, they’re particularly devastating to livestock and are estimated to cause hundreds of millions of dollars in damage each year. As such, the US Department of Agriculture has been leading the response to the threat, which had been held far at bay until recently. NWS used to be endemic in the US, causing heavy losses to cattle in the country. But, in the 1950s, US scientists developed a strategy to eliminate the flies by raising and releasing sterile male flies. The method exploits the fact that female flies mate only once in their 21-day lifespan. Thus, unproductive mating with a flood of sterile males can cause the population to crash.

With this strategy, screwworms were eradicated from the US around 1966 and, through coordinated efforts, cleared out from Central America in the subsequent decades. They were declared eradicated from Panama in 2006 and actively held at bay with continual sterile-fly releases along the Darién Gap, creating a biological barrier. But the barrier was breached in 2022 amid development and movement through and around the gap. Since then, the flies have quickly been marching north with the help of unregulated cattle movements.

Across Central America and Mexico, there have been 1,190 human cases of NWS reported and seven deaths. More than 148,000 animals have been affected.

In September, the USDA warned that an 8-month-old cow with an active NWS infection was found in a feedlot in the Mexican state of Nuevo León, just 70 miles from the border. The finding prompted Texas Agriculture Commissioner Sid Miller to step up warnings about the threat.

“The screwworm is dangerously close,” Miller said at the time. “It nearly wiped out our cattle industry before; we need to act forcefully now.”

According to the USDA’s latest data, Nuevo León has seen three cases in the outbreak, with none that are currently active. But, its neighboring state, Tamaulipas, is having a flare-up, with eight animal cases considered active. The Mexican state shares a border with the southern-most portion of Texas. Mexico overall has reported 24 hospitalizations among people and 601 animal cases.

For now, the NWS has not been detected in the US, and the CDC considers the risk to people to be low.

“However, given the potential for geographic spread, CDC is issuing this Health Advisory to increase awareness of the outbreak and to summarize CDC recommendations for clinicians and health departments in the United States on case identification and reporting, specimen collection, diagnosis, and treatment of NWS, as well as guidance for the public,” the agency said.

Generally, the agency advises being on the lookout for egg masses or fly larvae in wounds or infection sites, especially if there’s destruction of living tissue or feelings of movement. Once discovered, health care workers should report the case and promptly remove and kill all larvae and eggs, preferably by drowning in a sealed, leak-proof container of 70 percent ethanol. “Failure to kill and properly dispose of all larvae or eggs could result in the new introduction and spread of NWS in the local environment,” the CDC warns in bold. At least 10 dead larvae should then be sent to the CDC for confirmation.

The USDA is currently releasing 100 million sterile male flies per week in Mexico to try to establish a new biological barrier.

This isn’t the fly’s first attempt at a US comeback since the 1960s. In 2016, the flies were somehow reintroduced to the Florida Keys, where they viciously attacked Key Deer, an endangered species and the smallest of North America’s white-tailed deer. The flies were eliminated again in 2017 using the sterile fly method.</div>

            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-01-20</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2026/01/macaque-facial-gestures-are-more-than-just-a-reflex-study-finds/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Recent advances in brain-computer interfaces have made it possible to more accurately extract speech from neural signals in humans, but language is just one of the tools we use to communicate. “When my young nephew asks for ice cream before dinner and I say ‘no,’ the meaning is entirely dictated by whether the word is punctuated with a smirk or a stern frown,” says Geena Ianni, a neuroscientist at the University of Pennsylvania. That’s why in the future, she thinks, neural prostheses meant for patients with a stroke or paralysis will decode facial gestures from brain signals in the same way they decode speech.

To lay a foundation for these future facial gesture decoders, Ianni and her colleagues designed an experiment to find out how neural circuitry responsible for making faces really works. “Although in recent years neuroscience got a good handle on how the brain perceives facial expressions, we know relatively little about how they are generated,” Ianni says. And it turned out that a surprisingly large part of what neuroscientists assumed about facial gestures was wrong.

For a long time, neuroscientists thought facial gestures in primates stemmed from a neat division of labor in the brain. “Case reports of patients with brain lesions suggested some brain regions were responsible for certain types of emotional expressions while other regions were responsible for volitional movements like speech,” Ianni explains. We’ve developed a clearer picture of speech by tracing the origin of these movements down to the level of individual neurons. But we’ve not done the same for facial expressions. To fill this gap, Ianni and her team designed a study using macaques—social primates that share most of their complex facial musculature with humans.

The study started by putting the macaques in an fMRI scanner to monitor their brain activity while recording their faces with a high-resolution camera. The team then exposed their participants to various stimuli: videos with other macaques making faces at them, interactive avatars, or other live macaques. “This elicited socially meaningful facial expressions that are part of the subjects’ natural repertoire,” Ianni says.

Based on the video analysis, scientists identified three facial gestures they wanted to focus on: the lipsmack macaques use to signal receptivity or submission; the threat face they make when they want to challenge or chase off an adversary; and chewing, a non-social, volitional movement. Then, using the fMRI scans, the team located key brain areas involved in triggering these gestures. And when this was done, Ianni and her colleagues went deeper—quite literally.

“We targeted these brain areas with sub-millimeter precision for implantation of micro-electrode arrays,” Ianni explains. This, for the first time, allowed her team to simultaneously record the activity from many neurons spaced across the areas where the brain generates facial gestures. The electrodes went into the primary motor cortex, the ventral premotor cortex, the primary somatosensory cortex, and the cingulate motor cortex. When they were in, the team once again exposed the macaques to the same set of social stimuli, looking for neural signatures of the three selected facial gestures. And that’s when things took a surprising turn.

The researchers expected to see a clear division of responsibilities, one where the cingulate cortex governs social signals, while the motor cortex is specialized in chewing. Instead, they found that every single region was involved in every type of gesture. Whether the macaques were threatening a rival or simply enjoying a snack, all four brain areas were firing in a coordinated symphony.

This led Ianni’s team to the question of how the brain distinguished between social gestures and chewing, since it apparently wasn’t about where the brain processed the information. The answer was in different neural codes—different ways that neurons represent and transmit information in the brain over time.

By analyzing neural population dynamics, the team identified a temporal hierarchy across the cortex in macaques. The cingulate cortex used a static neural code. “The static means the firing pattern of neurons is persistent across both multiple repetitions of the same facial gesture and across time,” Ianni explains, and maintained their firing pattern till 0.8 seconds after that. “A single decoder which learns this pattern could be used at any timepoint or during any trial to read out the facial expression,” Ianni says.

The firing rates in the motor and somatosensory cortex, on the other hand, looked radically different. This suggests there is a dynamic neural code defined by rapidly changing firing rate relationships amongst the neural populations.

The team thinks this means that the cingulate cortex manages the social purpose and context of the facial gesture, which is relatively stable. This may be where the brain integrates sensory cues—like the look of another monkey’s expression—with its own internal state to produce the right facial gesture for the occasion.

The dynamic code areas implement this expression by driving individual muscles. “They’re driving the kinematics like ‘move this lip a millimeter to the left, now a millimeter to the right,’” Ianni explains. These constant miniscule movements of muscles are necessary because facial expressions are usually dynamic—macaques’ eyelids, lips, cheeks, and ears are constantly twitching and changing their position even if the end effect looks still from a distance.

But that’s just the beginning of a long journey.

“There have been such fabulous, impressive advances in the field of assistive communication devices even since I started this project,” Ianni says, and points to neural prostheses developed by Maitreyee Wairagkar’s team Ars covered in 2025 as one of the examples. Building a similar neural prosthesis for decoding facial gestures is unlikely to happen overnight, though. We’re a rather long way away from truly restoring the ability to communicate through facial gestures to patients who lost it.

Ianni’s study is the first that recorded neurons producing facial gestures with multi-electrode arrays. This means we’ve only just begun to build up base science on the neural mechanism behind making faces. This is the point where neural speech decoding technology was in the late 1990s, and we still can’t make that reliable enough for regular clinical products.

Still, Ianni remains hopeful. “I hope our work goes towards enabling the field, even the tiniest bit, towards more naturalistic and rich communication designs that will improve lives of patients after brain injury,” she says.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Wondering what your career looks like in our increasingly uncertain, AI-powered future? According to Palantir CEO Alex Karp, it’s going to involve less of the comfortable office work to which most people aspire, a more old fashioned grunt work with your hands.

Speaking at the World Economic Forum yesterday, Karp insisted that the future of work is vocational — not just for those already in manufacturing and the skilled trades, but for the majority of humanity.

In the age of AI, Karp told attendees at a forum, a strong formal education in any of the humanities will soon spell certain doom.

“You went to an elite school, and you studied philosophy; hopefully you have some other skill,” he warned, adding that AI “will destroy humanities jobs.”

Karp, who himself holds humanities degrees from the elite liberal arts institutions of Haverford College and Stanford Law, will presumably be alright. With a net worth of $15.5 billion — well within the top 0.1 percent of global wealth owners — the Palantir CEO has enough money and power to live like a feudal lord (and that’s before AI even takes over.)

The rest of us, he indicates, will be stuck on the assembly line, building whatever the tech companies require.

“If you’re a vocational technician, or like, we’re building batteries for a battery company… now you’re very valuable, if not irreplaceable,” Karp insisted. “I mean, y’know, not to divert to my usual political screeds, but there will be more than enough jobs for the citizens of your nation, especially those with vocational training.”

Now, there’s nothing wrong with vocational work or manufacturing. The global economy runs on these jobs. But in a theoretical world so fundamentally transformed by AI that intellectual labor essentially ceases to exist, it’s telling that tech billionaires like Karp see the rest of humanity as their worker bees.

It seems that the AI revolution never seems to threaten those who stand to profit the most from it — just the 99.9 percent of us building their batteries.

            <h2>Scientists Suddenly Discover That Cow Tools Are Real</h2>
            <p><strong>Futurism | 2026-01-20</strong></p>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">After more than forty years, a bizarre panel from “The Far Side” comic strip has finally become prophecy. The cartoon depicts a strangely eye-less, bipedal cow standing in front of a bench of oddly-shaped objects, with the caption “Cow tools,” and no further context.

The “joke” — that cows are too stupid to make practical tools? — landed so flat that the cartoonist Gary Larson issued a public statement explaining it after readers swamped newspapers with confused inquiries after it ran.

Larson probably couldn’t predict that “Cow tools” would become a cultish internet meme decades later, serving for those in the know as an endearing icon of anti-humor — with such a heavy emphasis on the “anti” part that it borders on avant-garde art.

Similarly, the storied cartoonist probably never anticipated that “Cow tools” would turn out to be a real phenomenon.

You heard that right. In a new study published in the journal Current Biology, scientists say they’ve documented the first ever verified case of a bovine using a tool, suggesting we’ve been seriously underestimating the intelligence of these gentle creatures.

In footage shared by the researchers, the cow named Veronika holds a lengthy broom handle in her mouth and manipulates it to scratch herself, displaying impressive dexterity as she reaches everywhere on her body from her stomach to her rear end.

The feat is clearly no fluke, and remarkably, Veronika had received no training.

“[Veronika] did not fashion tools like the cow in Gary Larson’s cartoon, but she selected, adjusted, and used one with notable dexterity and flexibility,” the researchers wrote in the study. “Perhaps the real absurdity lies not in imagining a tool-using cow, but in assuming such a thing could never exist.”

Cows itch, just like us. But Veronika the cow takes things into her own hands. Or rather: into her mouth.Scientists say it’s the first experimentally verified instance of cattle using a tool.  https://t.co/lnEEHQgVai pic.twitter.com/kxGEK4MWsH

The authors highlight how astonishingly little research has been done to explore the cognitive abilities of cows and other cattle. As author Alice Auersperg, a cognitive biologist at the University of Veterinary Medicine, Vienna, put it, the “findings highlight how assumptions about livestock intelligence may reflect gaps in observation rather than genuine cognitive limits,” she said in a statement about the work.

Veronika is a Swiss Brown cow and was raised by a farmer in Austria, who starting ten years ago began to notice that the creature would sometimes pick up sticks on her own to scratch herself. After a video taken of Veronika’s shrewd habits caught the researcher’s attention, they immediately traveled to the farm to study her closely, performing controlled trials in which they carefully observed and recorded her habits.

The findings were stunning. They found that Veronika would consistently target specific body parts, and that she generally preferred using the brush end of the stick to scratch herself — except when she scratched more sensitive regions of her body, when she instead favored the smooth end. In further evidence of the cow’s deliberate control, she used wide, forceful movements to scratch her upper body, while soothing her lower-body with slower and more controlled ones. This demonstrates “genuinely flexible tool use,” lead author Antonio Osuna-Mascaró, a researcher at the University of Veterinary Medicine, Vienna, said in the statement, as well as the ability to anticipate the “outcome of her actions and adjusting her grip and movements accordingly.”

Tool use was once considered the hallmark of human intelligence, but that notion has firmly been debunked, challenging a narrower understanding of what intelligence is. Some chimpanzees, for example, use sticks to extract termites from trees. Crows, too, are frequently observed using twigs to reach their grub.

That said, tool usage is rarely observed in the wild, and it’s even more rare to see it used in a “flexible,” multi-purpose manner.

“Because she is using the tool on her own body, this represents an egocentric form of tool use, which is generally considered less complex than tool use directed at external objects,” said Osuna-Mascaró. “At the same time, she faces clear physical constraints, as she must manipulate tools with her mouth.”

While Veronika’s skills are stunning, she probably isn’t an singularly intelligent cow — which is encouraging to scientists. “We know more about the tool use of exotic animals on remote islands than we do about the cows we live with,” Osuna-Mascaró told CNN in an interview. Now, at least, we’re “starting to be sensitive enough to observe them.”

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Last week, we broke down a major debacle unfolding in the health research space. To recap: over the past month, concerned researchers have been sounding the alarm about a reprehensible vaccine study which was to be funded by the United States Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to the tune of $1.6 million.

According to the trial protocols, obtained by Inside Medicine writer and physician Jeremy Faust from an anonymous American employee at the US Center for Disease Control (US CDC), the research would have followed 14,000 infants in the West African nation of Guinea-Bissau. The problem? Only 7,000 of those newborns would have received an urgently needed hepatitis B vaccine, in order to compare the two groups. On top of the flagrant ethics violations, the total cost of the research would have exceeded the cost to pay for “over a decade’s worth of Hepatitis B vaccine birth doses [for everyone] in Guinea-Bissau.”

In their interview with Faust, the unnamed CDC employee called it “another Tuskegee,” a reference to the Tuskegee syphilis study, in which hundreds of Black men with syphilis were studied by government researchers — who never informed them of their disease or made them aware of the treatment that had been discovered for it.

“I have read every word of the protocol dated January 14, 2026,” Faust told Futurism in an email. “It is wretched.”

At the time of our writing, the Guardian had reported that officials with the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention — the public health agency run by the African Union, not to be confused with the US CDC — stated that the trial had been halted, seemingly by Guinea-Bissau’s public health authorities.

This is where things get weird. In an email responding to our post about the situation, an official from the HHS press office declared that the vaccine trial was still on.

“To be clear, the trial will proceed as planned,” the spokesperson insisted. “Africa CDC, an organization with no affiliation to the US CDC, shared weeks-old communications unrelated to the trial as part of a public-relations campaign aimed to shape public perception rather than engaging with the scientific facts.”

The official also makes it clear that the HHS sees these infants more like lab rats than human beings.

“This research represents the world’s first, and potentially only, opportunity to rigorously evaluate the overall health effects of [hepatitis B],” they continued.

Those comments are astonishing enough. But in followup remarks that they insisted were “on background” — despite the fact that we’d agreed to no such arrangement — they went on to disparage their colleagues at the Africa CDC in coarse terms that were striking even by the standards of the notoriously churlish Trump administration.

“This is a powerless, fake organization attempting to manufacture credibility by repeating its claims publicly,” the spokesperson wrote. “It is not a reliable source, and its statements should be treated accordingly.”

The HHS didn’t respond to repeated requests to explain the outburst.

It’s a stunning comment about the Africa CDC, the official health agency of the African Union, which represents 55 African nations. This isn’t some fly-by-night shell operation — it’sa health organization that served as the COVID-19 testing hub for 48 African countries at the outbreak of the pandemic, and which has coordinated millions of emergency vaccines for infectious diseases ranging from malaria to mpox.

In October, the World Health Organization and the Africa CDC signed a landmark collaboration agreement to “consolidate their partnership” and “accelerate progress toward shared health goals.” Simply put, if there were any serious question of Africa CDC’s legitimacy, the WHO — a specialized agency of the United Nations — would not have signed off on this strategic agreement.

As for the HHS claiming the controversial study is still on, the Africa CDC tells us there’s a press conference this Thursday — so we’ll be watching.

            <h2>The CEO of Microsoft Suddenly Sounds Extremely Nervous About AI</h2>
            <p><strong>Futurism | 2026-01-20</strong></p>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">It sounds like Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella is already coming up with excuses in case the whole AI boom turns out to be a massive bust— which, by the way, he’s warning might come to pass.

Speaking at the World Economic Forum at Davos, Switzerland on Tuesday, Nadella pontificated about what would constitute such a speculative bubble, and said that the long-term success of AI tech hinges on it being used across a broad range of industries — as well as seeing an uptick in adoption in the developing world where it’s not as popular, the Financial Times reports. If AI fails, in other words, it’s everyone else’s fault for not using it.

Nadella explained the pitfalls the AI industry would need to avoid, perhaps betraying his own anxieties about its future.

“For this not to be a bubble by definition, it requires that the benefits of this are much more evenly spread,” Nadella said, as quoted by the FT. The “tell-tale sign of if it’s a bubble,” he added, would be if only tech companies were benefitting from the rise of AI. He gave the example of a pharmaceutical company using AI to accelerate drug trials; it doesn’t need to be used to discover the “magical molecule,” but provide some other tangible, less extraordinary benefit to developing the product.

Nadella is adamant that these kinds of boosts that AI provides will justify AI and carry the industry, stressing less spectacular and more practical applications of the tech.

“I’m much more confident that this is a technology that will, in fact, build on the rails of cloud and mobile, diffuse faster, and bend the productivity curve, and bring local surplus and economic growth all around the world,” he proclaimed.

Nadella’s anxiety-tinged and more mundane-sounding forecasts for AI’s future comes as he’s been notably defensive about AI lately, as Microsoft reaffirms its commitment to spend tens of billions more on data centers and other AI-related costs. Earlier this month, he begged the public to stop using the term “slop,” the rapidly accepted new lingo for describing the shoddy text, images, and videos churned out by AI models, which Merriam-Webster crowned word of the year. Nadella’s thesis seemed to be that we should stop being mean about AI as it refines its “jagged edges” — which could take a while, by his own admission.

He isn’t alone in tamping down his promises for AI as a cloud of uncertainty looms over the industry, with experts continuing to raise the specter of AI progress hitting a wall, and noting that years into the AI boom, the tech still hasn’t yielded meaningful gains in productivity. Many tech CEOs not named Elon Musk have tried to pretend that they haven’t been using the pursuit of building a fabled artificial general intelligence, or AGI, as the rallying cry for the industry this whole time, as the idea of creating such a system that surpasses human intelligence seems more and more far fetched in the immediate term.

Striking a similar tone, OpenAI CFO Sarah Friar declared that the company will focus on “practical adoption” of AI in 2026, and “how people, companies, and countries are using it day to day.” ChatGPT users will soon get a first hand look of what this pivot to practical economics looks like: last week, the company announced that free users will start being targeted with sponsored ads and content based on their conversations.

            <div id="article-text">Earlier this month, NASA announced that it had to cancel a scheduled spacewalk, citing a “medical situation” affecting a “single crew member who is stable” on board the International Space Station.

The mystery illness eventually led to the space agency staging the first medical evacuation in 25 years of continuous operation on board the aging orbital outpost, rushing four astronauts back to Earth in a move that brought the station’s number of occupants from seven to a skeleton crew of just three.

While the medical incident only affected a single astronaut, who has yet to be identified for privacy reasons, all four members of the Crew-11 mission cut their time on board the ISS short by weeks, safely splashing down off the coast of San Diego early Thursday morning.

The four astronauts were airlifted to the Scripps Memorial Hospital in San Diego via helicopter for a “planned overnight stay at a local medical facility for additional evaluation,” according to a January 16 statement. After being “released as expected,” they continued their journey to NASA’s Johnson Space Center in Houston, where they will “continue standard postflight reconditioning and evaluations.”

“All crew members remain stable,” the space agency reassured. “To protect the crew’s medical privacy, no specific details regarding the condition or individual will be shared.”

It’s an exceedingly rare event, highlighting the challenges inherent to providing healthcare in space. While hundreds of miles above the surface, specialized care is hard, if not impossible, to execute. While astronauts undergo rigorous EMT-level training so they can respond to emergencies on board the station, they aren’t full-blown medical professionals, and can only do so much under the direction of doctors back on Earth.

There’s a lot to still learn about providing care during medical emergencies, particularly when it comes to long-duration space exploration missions into deep space. According to a 2022 study, there still are plenty of “gaps in knowledge regarding the potential for unanticipated in-flight medical events to affect crew health and capacity, and potentially compromise mission success.”

As researchers from Northumbria University in Newcastle point out in a recent essay for The Conversation, medical emergencies are remarkably rare on the ISS, despite being expected to occur on average every three years. Studies have shown that the most common health issues astronauts experience are skin irritation, congestion, disruptions to sleep, and in-flight injuries — most of which are ironically caused by exercise, which is designed to protect astronauts’ long-term health.

Spending prolonged periods in a microgravity environment has also been shown to affect astronauts’ vision and blood pressure.

Now that there’s finally been a medical emergency on the station, though, it’s unclear whether the public — or even the broader medical community — will ever find out any details.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Anybody who’s regularly driven in winter conditions knows the importance of keeping windshield washer fluid topped up. Keeping the salty grime stuck to your windshield and rear window to a minimum is crucial for visibility, especially in inclement weather.

In the case of an autonomously operating vehicle, ensuring visibility for the vehicle’s sensors could similarly be a matter of life and death. That’s particularly true for Tesla’s Cybercab ride-hailing vehicles, which rely entirely on camera feeds. Recent sightings of an early prototype in Chicago — a city known for its harsh and long winters — suggest the EV maker is taking the matter seriously, opting to install a rear-facing camera washer to keep obstructions to a minimum.

Images of the salt-covered prototype show liquid — presumably windshield washing liquid or antifreeze — dripping down its rear bumper, almost as if it had a runny nose.

The Cybercab has a rear camera washer!This is a feature than many Tesla owners have been asking for, especially in snowy areas. Hope it makes it to the rest of the lineup. https://t.co/ufrUvrSnun pic.twitter.com/nueAsqz2YO

The design change suggests the Elon Musk-led company is taking active measures to ensure its Cybercabs can operate in actual winter outside of its home states of California and Texas.

Tesla is hoping to expand its autonomous Robotaxi system in cities across the country. In November, the company announced that Las Vegas, Phoenix, Dallas, Houston, and Miami are next. Why the cab was spotted in Chicago remains unclear.

However, others lamented the fact that the company’s EV lineup, which has since been seemingly relegated to the bottom of the company’s priority list, had yet to benefit from a similar washer system, despite being on sale for many years now. Rear camera washer systems are a common feature among many production vehicles from other carmakers.

“This is a feature that many Tesla owners have been asking for, especially in snowy areas,” tweeted automotive journalist Sawyer Merritt. “Hope it makes it to the rest of the lineup.”

Tesla first showed off its Cybercab during a flashy event in October 2024. The odd design sparked a heated discussion, with critics pointing out its diminutive size — it can only fit two passengers — as well as a possibly unrealistic target price, and plenty of far-reaching promises about wireless charging.

At the time, Musk promised that the vehicle would enter production in 2027. Then, during the company’s Q3 earnings call last year, he promised that volume production would instead be reached in 2026.

“At this point, I feel 100 percent confident that we can sell unsupervised full self-driving at a safety level much greater than human,” he told investors.

But given the state of the company’s EV software, which is still leading to plenty of collisions and near-misses even when the weather is playing along, the company has its work cut out to realize Musk’s ever-ambitious vision.

That’s particularly true when it comes to rolling out an autonomous ride-hailing service in places that experience extreme weather, from frozen-over roadways to a barrage of salt that can clog up vehicle sensors in a heartbeat.

Let’s hope Tesla is aware that keeping the antifreeze topped up will be far more mission-critical than one might think.

            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/21/language-learning-marketplace-preplys-unicorn-status-embodies-ukrainian-resilience/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Language learning marketplace Preply is now valued at $1.2 billion after raising a $150 million Series D round that marks a new chapter for the 14-year-old company, whose previous backers include Horizon Capital, Hoxton Ventures, Owl Ventures and Techstars Berlin.

While Preply has been connecting language learners with tutors since 2013, it has now been EBITDA profitable for twelve months. Not coincidentally, it has also ramped up AI integration to support its 100,000 tutors and continue scaling.

That’s a fine line — Duolingo faced backlash after declaring it would become an “AI-first company,” and tutors have been a key differentiator for Preply. The company is adamant it won’t replace them — but AI can also bring consistency to a model that relies on self-employed instructors. The future of learning “is going to be human-guided and amplified by AI,” Preply CEO Kirill Bigai told TechCrunch.

According to Bigai, Preply already applies AI to features such as lesson summaries and homework, but also to match learners to tutors that best fit their needs. To further develop these capabilities, he said Preply is now hiring AI talent across its four offices — Barcelona, London and New York but also Kyiv, which the company hasn’t left despite the Russian invasion.

Although Preply is headquartered in the U.S., where it got its first start, Bigai and his cofounders are Ukrainian and the company has been very actively supporting their home country. They have been doing that in several ways since the war started, including as an employer. “We are very committed [to the] Ukrainian office,” said Bigai.

Out of Preply’s 750 employees, approximately 150 people work from Kyiv, despite Russian strikes regularly forcing them into shelters and causing power outages that have made the current freezing winter particularly challenging. “Our office has different generators so we have electricity, Internet, and the office is warm and it’s open 24/7 so any Ukrainian team member can come to the office at any time,” Bigai said.

These employees may be grateful to Preply — but Bigai is grateful to them and has deep admiration for his people. “Ukrainians are going through very challenging times, and it builds a significant resilience and creativity,” he said. Having to adapt to the reality and uncertainty of war also transformed Preply. “I think the fact that the company went through this experience — and how so many people helped other people — made us stronger, more resilient, more creative,” he added.

With its new funding, the edtech company has now joined the growing cohort of unicorns with Ukrainian roots, including Fintech-IT Group and Grammarly. But it may also follow in the footsteps of Airbnb, whose former CFO Laurence Tosi led the Series D through his growth equity firm, WestCap. While Bigai said Preply has no timeline or concrete IPO plans yet, he noted WestCap’s “phenomenal experience in [taking] companies public, which is one of the things that we will continue to think about.”

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">India is a country of extremes when it comes to app usage. The country continues to top global app downloads, but doesn’t feature in the top 20 markets in terms of consumer spending, according to a new report by market intelligence firm Sensor Tower. India was one of the only markets in the top 10 to see downloads grow year-on-year in 2025, besides Pakistan, the report found.

After downloads declined in 2024 to 24.6 billion from 2023’s 25.9 billion, India bounced back in 2025 with 25.5 billion app downloads.

People were also more engaged, thanks to AI and microdrama apps, as time spent in apps rose from 1.13 trillion hours in 2024 to 1.23 trillion last year, according to the report.

When it comes to category growth, social media, social messenger, and security apps dipped. Meanwhile, AI assistants, microdrama apps, video editing apps, social discovery, and food and delivery apps rose (largely because of the rise of ultra-fast grocery delivery services).

Short drama app downloads grew by over 350 million in the country, and AI assistants grew by 346 million downloads, which is also reflective of the global trend.

Users in India downloaded generative AI apps 198 million times in 2024. Unsurprisingly, that figure jumped to 602 million in 2025.  First, companies like OpenAI and Google launched new image models that saw the demand for AI assistants grow exponentially in India.

Second, multiple AI companies started offering their premium plans for free to Indian users to gain market share.

ChatGPT was the top generative AI app in terms of downloads, followed by Google Gemini, Perplexity, and Grok. OpenAI’s assistant also gained rankings in overall downloads and was just behind Instagram in terms of downloads.

Microdrama was another category that rose in 2025, both globally and in India. Kuku TV, Story TV, QuickTV (by the makers of social network ShareChat and short video app Moj), and DashReels were first, third, fifth, and eighth in the video streaming category.

Kuku TV, whose parent company raised $85 million in a Series C round last fall led by Granite Asia, also got the fourth ranking in the category globally. In November, ShareChat co-founder Manohar Charan told CNBC that over 40 million users were watching microdrama content on its Quick TV platform. Industry experts have already predicted that India’s microdrama market could reach tens of billions of dollars by 2030.

A key indicator for the category’s rise was that after the third quarter of last year, users in India downloaded more short drama apps than OTT streaming apps like Netflix and JioHotstar.

In India, the domestic app industry seems to be rising as the share of downloads from local players rose from 33.91% to 36.52%. However, this rise could be due to people downloading more apps related to quick commerce, government services, and finance rather than entertainment and other digital products, as the share of revenue from in-app purchases for domestic publishers remained flat.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">In 2025, consumers spent more money on non-game mobile apps than they did on games for the first time, according to the findings from market intelligence firm Sensor Tower’s annual “State of Mobile” report. While this milestone had been seen in particular markets, like the U.S., or during certain quarters, 2025 marked the first time it occurred globally. Worldwide, consumers spent approximately $85 billion on apps last year, representing a 21% year-over-year increase. The figure was also nearly 2.8x the amount spent just five years ago.

Generative AI, a defining trend over the past year, led the revenue growth, as in-app purchase revenue in this category more than tripled to top $5 billion in 2025. Downloads of AI apps also grew, doubling year-over-year to reach 3.8 billion.

The segment’s growth can be attributed to several factors. For one, the popularity of AI assistants among consumers was a large driver, with all of the top 10 apps by downloads being AI assistants. This group was led by OpenAI’s ChatGPT, Google Gemini, and DeepSeek. ChatGPT alone generated $3.4 billion in global in-app purchase (IAP) revenue — a figure that we reported on late last year.

In 2025, consumers spent 48 billion hours in generative AI apps, or 3.6x the total time spent in 2024 and 10x the level seen in 2023. Session volume, meaning the number of times users opened and used an app, topped one trillion in 2025. Of note, this figure was growing faster than downloads, suggesting that existing users were deepening their engagement faster than the apps were adding new users.

Another factor driving AI app revenue and adoption is that big tech companies like Google, Microsoft, and X have been heavily investing in their AI assistants to challenge ChatGPT. Over the past year, they’ve been rolling out new capabilities at a rapid pace, improving in areas like coding assistance, content generation, reasoning, task execution, accuracy, and more. The report specifically called out improvements in image and video generation, like ChatGPT’s GPT-4o image generation model released in March, and Google’s Nano Banana.

Among the top AI publishers, OpenAI and DeepSeek accounted for nearly 50% of global downloads, up from 21% in 2024. Meanwhile, big tech publishers grew their share of the market from 14% to nearly 30% during this same time, crowding out earlier ChatGPT competitors like Nova, Codeway, and Chat Smith.

The report also highlighted the role that mobile plays in connecting users to generative AI services. Sensor Tower estimates that the total audience for AI assistants topped 200 million in the U.S. by year-end, and more than half (110M) were accessing the assistants exclusively on mobile devices. In 2024, for comparison, only around 13 million users were mobile-only.

Beyond assistants, other popular AI apps included the AI music generation app Suno; ByteDance’s text-to-video app, Jimeng AI; and AI companion apps like Character.ai and PolyBuzz.

However, AI wasn’t the only revenue driver last year, Sensor Tower found. Other apps, including those in categories like social media, video streaming, and productivity, also helped fuel the growth, the report noted. For instance, consumers spent an average of 90 minutes per day on social media apps, totaling nearly 2.5 trillion hours, up 5% year-over-year.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Days ahead of a scheduled trial, social media company Snap has settled a lawsuit accusing the platform of causing social media addiction, according to reports from multiple outlets.

According to the New York Times, the settlement was announced Tuesday in the California Superior Court in Los Angeles County. The lawsuit against Snap was brought by a 19-year-old known in court documents as K.G.M., accusing the social media app of designing algorithms and features that caused addiction and mental health issues.

The terms of the settlement were not disclosed.

The lawsuit also names other platforms, including Meta, YouTube, and TikTok. No settlement has been reached with these platforms. Notably, Snap is still a defendant in other similar social media addiction cases filed against it.

According to documents unveiled in the ongoing cases, Snap employees raised concerns around risks to the mental health of teens dating back at least nine years. The company has said these examples were “cherry-picked” and were taken out of context.

Plaintiffs in these cases are drawing parallels to Big Tobacco — referring to lawsuits in the 1990s against cigarette companies that concealed health risks — alleging that the platforms obscured information about potential harms from their users. They argue that features like infinite scroll, auto video play and algorithmic recommendations have tricked users into continuously using apps, leading to depression, eating disorders, and self-harm, according to NYT.

Snap CEO Evan Spiegel had been scheduled to testify in the trial, which would have marked the first time a social media company faces a jury in an addiction lawsuit — no platform has lost such a case at trial yet. The remaining case against Meta, TikTok, and YouTube is set to proceed with jury selection beginning next Monday, January 27, with Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg expected to take the witness stand.

If plaintiffs prevail, legal experts predict the cases could result in multibillion-dollar settlements and potentially force platforms to redesign their products. But the companies have so far defended themselves in part by arguing that those same design choices — like algorithmic recommendations, push notifications, and infinite scroll — are similar to a newspaper deciding what stories to publish and are protected speech under the First Amendment.

Snap did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/20/amagi-slides-in-india-debut-as-cloud-tv-software-firm-tests-investor-appetite/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Amagi Media Labs, a Bengaluru-headquartered company that sells cloud software used to run and monetize TV and streaming channels, saw its shares slide in its India market debut after raising ₹17.89 billion (about $196 million) in an IPO — a deal that stands out in a market still dominated by consumer companies going public.

Shares opened at ₹318 on Wednesday, a 12% discount to the ₹361 issue price, before climbing to ₹356.95 and later trading around ₹348.85, valuing Amagi at ₹75.44 billion (around $825.81 million), according to the National Stock Exchange. Amagi was last valued at $1.4 billion in a private funding round in November 2022, after a $100 million raise led by General Atlantic, and investors sought to buy more than 30 times the available shares.

The Bengaluru-headquartered company sells cloud software that helps TV networks and streaming services distribute and monetize video, and earns almost all of its revenue outside India — including around 73% from the U.S. and about 20% from Europe — CEO and co-founder Baskar Subramanian said in an interview, making it a rare export-first technology listing on Indian exchanges.

The $196 million IPO included a fresh issue of shares worth ₹8.16 billion (about $89.33 million), while existing investors sold about 26.9 million shares through an offer-for-sale. The deal was smaller than Amagi’s earlier plan, after the company trimmed the fresh issue and reduced the number of shares to be sold by existing backers from 34.2 million.

Norwest Venture Partners, Accel, and Premji Invest were among Amagi’s existing shareholders who sold shares in the IPO. Subramanian told TechCrunch the sales were only a “very small portion” of holdings, and said the company’s founders were not selling a single share.

“For us as an event, it’s a pit stop in a long journey,” he said.

Accel has particularly retained close to a 10% stake in Amagi after the IPO, even as the listing locks in a roughly 3.3x gain on shares it acquired at around ₹108 per share. “To make the IPO, we are reluctantly exiting as little as possible to make this happen,” said Shekhar Kirani, an Accel partner.

Founded in 2008 by Subramanian, Srividhya Srinivasan, and Arunachalam Srinivasan Karapattu, Amagi counts content companies such as Lionsgate Studios, Fox, and Sinclair Broadcast Group among its clients, as well as distributors including Roku, Vizio, Rakuten TV, and DirecTV, and advertising platforms such as The Trade Desk and Index Exchange.

Subramanian said Amagi is riding a shift as broadcasters and streamers move away from “big iron” hardware and satellite-based workflows toward cloud-based operations, arguing that only a small portion of the industry has completed the transition so far. The company has also begun pitching new automation and AI-driven tools to help media companies cut labor-heavy operating costs, he said.

The company’s revenue from operations rose 34.6% year-over-year to ₹7.05 billion (around $77.18 million) in the six months ended September 30, 2025, while net revenue retention was about 127% — meaning existing customers increased their spending by 27%, per its prospectus (PDF).

Amagi is betting that broadcast and live video are still in the early stages of moving to the cloud, Subramanian told TechCrunch, estimating that less than 10% of the industry has made the shift, leaving a long runway as media groups modernise infrastructure and expand ad-supported streaming.

The company’s appeal lies in being a “premium” and highly reliable platform for blue-chip customers, said Rachit Parekh, a partner at Accel, arguing that downtime during major live events can be highly costly for broadcasters and streamers. This dynamic has helped drive high customer retention and expansion.

Nonetheless, Amagi is also competing against legacy broadcast vendors that are racing to modernize their own offerings for the cloud, while its push into AI-driven automation will test whether Amagi can expand beyond infrastructure into software with better profit margins without rising cloud costs eating into profitability.

Amagi said it plans to plow most of the fresh proceeds into technology and cloud infrastructure, allocating ₹5.50 billion ($60.21 million) for that purpose, while also setting aside funds for potential acquisitions and general corporate use, per its prospectus.

Amagi’s debut comes as India’s IPO market has drawn a rising number of technology-led listings, supported by strong domestic investor demand even as late-stage startup funding remains subdued. The shift has positioned public markets as both a growth-financing option and a path to exits for early backers, a dynamic that has become more visible as private capital has turned more selective.

India’s tech sector recorded 42 IPOs in 2025, up from 36 in 2024, per market intelligence firm Tracxn. Several venture-backed startups, including consumer and fintech firms, are also widely expected to test public markets in 2026 as the pipeline builds.

            <p><strong>TechCrunch | 2026-01-21</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/20/bolna-nabs-6-3-million-from-general-catalyst-for-its-india-focused-voice-orchestration-platform/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Industry reports and the growth of voice model companies in the Indian market suggest that there is a growing demand for voice AI solutions in the country. Voice is a popular medium for communication among people and businesses in India. That’s why enterprises and startups are eager to use voice AI to be more efficient at customer support, sales, customer acquisition, hiring, and training.

But recognizing market demand is one thing — proving businesses will pay is another. Y Combinator rejected the application from Bolna, a voice orchestration startup built by Maitreya Wagh and Prateek Sachan, five times before finally accepting it into the fall 2025 batch, skeptical that the founders could turn interest into revenue.

“When we were applying for Y Combinator, the feedback we got was, ‘great to see that you have a product that can create realistic voice agents, but Indian enterprises are not going to pay, and you are not going to make money out of this,’” Wagh told TechCrunch.

The startup applied with the same idea for the fall batch but was able to show it had revenue of more than $25,000 coming in every month for the last few months. At that time, the company was running $100 pilots to help users build voice agents. Now the startup is pricing those pilots at $500.

The momentum has continued. The startup said on Tuesday that it has raised a $6.3 million seed round led by General Catalyst, with participation from Y Combinator, Blume Ventures, Orange Collective, Pioneer Fund, Transpose Capital, and Eight Capital. The round also includes individual investors, including Aarthi Ramamurthy, Arpan Sheth, Sriwatsan Krishnan, Ravi Iyer, and Taro Fukuyama.

Bolna is building an orchestration layer — essentially a platform that connects and manages different AI voice technologies — akin to startups like Vapi, LiveKit, and VoiceRun, to suit the idiosyncrasies of interactions in India, including noise cancellation, getting verification on the caller ID platform Truecaller, and handling mixed languages.

Feature-wise, the company has built specific nuances for Indian users, such as speaking numbers in English regardless of the core language, or allowing for keypad input for longer inputs.

Wagh noted that the key differentiation of Bolna is that it makes it easy for users to build voice agents by just describing them, even if they don’t know much about the underlying technology, and start using them for calls. The company said that 75% of its revenue is coming from self-serve customers.

He also said that because Bolna is an orchestration layer, it doesn’t depend on a single model, so enterprises can easily switch when there is a better model available.

“Our platform allows customers to switch models easily or even use different models for different locales to get the best out of them. An orchestration layer is necessary for enterprises to ensure they are getting the best models because one model can be better today and another one can be better tomorrow,” Wagh said.

The company has a range of clients, including car reselling platform Spinny, on-demand house-help startup Snabbit, beverage companies, and dating apps. Most of these are small to midsize businesses that use Bolna’s self-serve platform.

Separately, Bolna is pursuing large enterprise deals. For these large enterprises and custom implementations, Bolna has a team of forward-deployed engineers — specialists who work directly with clients on-site or closely with their teams. The startup has signed two large enterprises as paying customers and has four more in the pilot stage. Currently, Bolna employs nine forward-deployed engineers and is adding two to three people to that team every month to support this enterprise push.

Bolna has seen steady growth in both call volumes and revenue. It say it’s now handling over 200,000 calls per day and on the verge of crossing $700,000 in annual recurring revenue (ARR). The company noted that while 60% to 70% of call volume is in English or Hindi, other regional languages are steadily rising.

Akarsh Shrivastava, who is part of the investment team at General Catalyst, said that the firm found Bolna impressive because its orchestration layer is flexible for various kinds of customers.

“Bolna allows you the freedom to choose any model and has a stack behind it to mold it according to your requirement. It’s a good option for people who want to own some part of the stack, want flexibility in model picking, and want to be able to maintain those products themselves,” Shrivastava told TechCrunch over a call.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Franklin D. Roosevelt famously illustrated with a simple metaphor the need for a healthy transatlantic alliance. Justifying his decision to lend Great Britain warships and other military supplies in the early days of World War II, Roosevelt likened it to loaning a neighbor a garden hose to put out the fire consuming his house. Sure, Roosevelt charitably wanted to help a neighbor in need. But it was self-interested too; if the neighbor could extinguish the blaze, it wouldn’t spread to FDR’s home. The United States benefited from the friendship—and the buffer—that allies could provide.

Today, Donald Trump will fly to Europe. Ukraine is already ablaze. And now the president is ready to set a bunch of new houses on fire.

The president will speak at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, tomorrow, and he appears prepared to shatter the nearly 80-year-old NATO alliance in order to seize Greenland. In his quest to claim a strategically located island of ice and rock, Trump has turned against his nation’s most stalwart friends. He has antagonized and mocked panicked European leaders, threatened punishing tariffs on countries that object to his plans, and pointedly not ruled out using military force. Trump’s thirst for Greenland—even if he stops short of ordering an armed invasion—threatens to unravel the partnership born from the ashes of World War II that has, in the decades since, ensured the spread of peace, prosperity, and democracy on both sides of the Atlantic.

Today marks one year since Trump’s return to office, and in that time, he has fundamentally reshaped the United States’ relationship with the rest of the world. But nothing has upended the global order more than what would happen if he follows through on his threats toward Greenland. The island, of course, belongs to Denmark, which says that it is not available for the taking. Troops from Europe have been dispatched to the territory, and Greenland’s prime minister warned his populace to prepare for an invasion. If Trump were to persist, Denmark could trigger NATO’s Article 5 mutual-defense pact, and then the unthinkable could occur: American soldiers firing on Europeans while Russian President Vladimir Putin’s dream of NATO’s self-immolation is thoroughly realized.

The annual meetings in Davos, normally a clubby gathering of business titans and political leaders, have been consumed by talk of what Trump may or may not do. European leaders have found themselves scrambling on strategy—appeasement? Defiance? Compromise? Early this morning, Trump posted screenshots of text messages that revealed the dilemma facing those leaders. (Lesson to everyone: Be careful what you text the guy unless you want the world to see.)

In one message, Mark Rutte—the secretary general of NATO, who has prized warm relations with Trump—praised the president’s foreign policies, then vowed that he is “committed to finding a way forward on Greenland.” But in another, French President Emmanuel Macron, whose relationship with Trump has been turbulent, admitted: “I do not understand what you are doing on Greenland.” In fact, Trump couldn’t be more clear, as he demonstrated once again by circulating a pair of presumably AI-generated images on social media. In one, he’s planting an American flag in Greenland. In the other, he’s lecturing European leaders in the Oval Office with a map behind him that depicts Greenland as part of the United States. (Canada and Venezuela too.)

Trolling close U.S. allies has seemingly been an unofficial policy of Trump’s second administration since its first days, beginning with Vice President Vance lecturing Europe in Munich on the virtues of free speech. But this time feels different for those nervously waiting in snowy Switzerland. The president’s address to the forum tomorrow is poised to be a defining moment, and Trump plans to make the unequivocal case that the United States should have Greenland, a senior White House official told me. For now, the administration is focused on purchasing Greenland or offering economic incentives to its residents and to those in Denmark, aides told me. But they are not ruling out the use of military force or economic pressure. The senior official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to candidly discuss internal strategy, added that the White House is considering joint military exercises, withholding participation in NATO, and additional tariffs. (The Supreme Court has continued to delay its ruling on the legality of Trump’s tariffs, keeping that tool in play here.)

Yet even as the administration brandishes trade as a first-strike weapon, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent delivered this message in Davos today to European allies: “Sit back. Take a deep breath. Do not retaliate.” He added again: “Do not retaliate.” (Europe did not say that it would listen.) But Trump’s audacious power play won’t stop there: While in Davos, he’s also expected to lean on foreign leaders to join his fledgling Board of Peace, which includes a $1 billion price tag for permanent membership. A number of European heads of state expressed reservations about the board—including that it has a seat earmarked for Putin, who seemed to celebrate the invitation by launching a massive strike against Kyiv this morning. When Macron suggested that he would not join, Trump angrily threatened higher tariffs.

Read: Trump’s billion-dollar Board of Peace

And now he has a new grudge: After being denied the Nobel Peace Prize that he covets, Trump this week registered his bitter complaints with the prime minister of Norway, writing that because of the snub, “I no longer feel an obligation to think purely of Peace,” while incorrectly claiming that Denmark’s ownership of Greenland is not supported by “written documents, it’s only a boat that landed there hundreds of years ago.”

Some greeted the note with fact-checks and derision. But not the White House: Officials proudly distributed it for all to read.

Greenland is more than just ice and rock—and it has more strategic importance than looking really big on certain maps. Its location is key for Arctic defense and trade routes. It’s rich in minerals. And, yes, Trump has cited those factors as he has declared the island vital for U.S. national security. But Denmark has repeatedly counter-declared that it would happily grant many of Trump’s new demands. Want to build a new military base? Sure! Name it after yourself? Just ask! Yet Trump’s lust for Greenland goes beyond that, people close to him have told me. It’s about increasing American dominance in the Western Hemisphere and redrawing the maps of the world. The island is roughly 836,000 square miles, which would make it the largest territorial addition in U.S. history, eclipsing the Louisiana Purchase and the acquisition of Alaska. It would be something for the history books, the people close to him have said. And that’s what Trump is focused on.

Recent polls are clear: Americans strongly disapprove of an attempt to seize Greenland, especially by force. But Trump has been gazing past the midterms and toward his own legacy. A look back at his two previous appearances at Davos illustrates Trump’s evolution. In 2018, he was willing to be something of a deferential guest, shelving some of his nationalist ideology and even saying, “‘America First’ does not mean America alone.” He continued: “When the United States grows, so does the world.” (Hard to believe, I know.) And then, in early 2020, he offered a fairly standard campaign speech, boasting about American progress but evincing little care about what happens beyond the United States’ own borders. That is not the case in Trump 2.0.

At the one-year mark, Trump’s foreign policy has been defined by rampant interventionism. Although he has not ended as many conflicts as he claims (Trump’s count is eight and growing), the U.S. has played a mediator role in global hot spots, most notably in Gaza. After months of watching the violence, the president pressured both Israel and Hamas to reach a deal to release the hostages and implement a fragile cease-fire. But he’s also continued to erode the U.S.-led global order, instigating risky diplomatic and economic fights with allies. He has not consistently focused on the threat posed by China. His attention to the war in Ukraine has come and gone, but he continues to reflexively defer to Putin. Part of why European leaders were at first slow to challenge Trump’s Greenland rhetoric was that they didn’t want to provoke him into completely abandoning Kyiv, officials there have told me.

Trump has also fallen in love with the concept of one-and-done military interventions: the bombing of Iran’s nuclear facilities, the strikes on alleged terrorist targets in Syria and Nigeria, and, of course, the capture of the Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro earlier this month. Aides have boasted that the Caracas operation was a turning point for the presidency; after limping to the finish of 2025 amid a series of electoral defeats, poor polls, and scandals, Trump seems reinvigorated. He is unchecked domestically—Minneapolis is under siege by federal forces—and internationally. He has been emboldened and has shown a new willingness to use force. In the hours before Air Force One was scheduled to lift off for Switzerland today, Trump was asked by a reporter how far he’d “be willing to go” to obtain Greenland.

Meanwhile, Europe waits. And watches for smoke.</div>

            <div id="article-text">This is an edition of The Atlantic Daily, a newsletter that guides you through the biggest stories of the day, helps you discover new ideas, and recommends the best in culture. Sign up for it here.

Donald Trump retains the ability to shock; the day he loses that, he will, like the biblical Samson—another man notable for his coiffure—lose his power entirely. When Trump started his second term as president a year ago, however, I doubted whether there was much more to learn about how his mind works. Even before he’d entered politics, Trump was overexposed. Since then, he has become the most scrutinized person in the world. His tendencies and foibles are well known to voters, politicians, and world leaders.

Yet in breaking one of his most entrenched patterns, he has provided perhaps the biggest surprise of the past year. During his first term, Trump was defined by his tendency to back down in any negotiation or fight: As I put it in a May 2018 article, he almost always folded, agreeing to concessions whether he was negotiating on trade with China or a budget resolution with Senate Democrats. More recently, though, he’s been following through, no matter how aberrant his ideas. The exact reason for this is difficult to pin down, though it likely includes the fact that he has more experience under his belt, fewer prudent voices in his ear, and a lame duck’s liberation from having to worry about reelection. In any case, his new determination is forcing countries around the world to reassess how to deal with him.

Nowhere is this so clear right now as with Trump’s continued pressure to acquire Greenland. In the wee hours of this morning, Trump went on a social-media spree, posting (among other things) an illustration of himself, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, and J. D. Vance planting a U.S. flag in Greenland. European leaders seem to slowly be coming to the conclusion that this isn’t just a feint.

When the president began making noise about taking the Danish territory early last year, many observers were baffled but not necessarily all that concerned—an impulse reinforced when the matter receded from Trump’s attention in the months that followed. They also had a long track record to draw on. In May 2017, I wrote that “foreign leaders have realized Trump is a pushover.” This held true for adversaries (China) and allies (Taiwan, NATO) alike throughout his first term.

It was especially true for rivals such as Russia and North Korea. Trump talked a fierce game—promising “fire and fury” for Pyongyang, for example—but his counterparts understood that despite his insistence that he was a master dealmaker, all they needed was to get him to a negotiating table. “Faced with a tough decision, the president has consistently blinked, giving in to his opponents,” I wrote in my 2018 article.

This pattern was clear enough that when Trump refused to concede the 2020 election, even his allies were dismissive. “What is the downside for humoring him for this little bit of time?” a senior Republican official told The Washington Post in November 2020. “It’s not like he’s plotting how to prevent Joe Biden from taking power on January 20.” That was exactly what he was doing, however ham-handedly. The effort to subvert the election was also a warning of things to come.

Even so, Trump’s return to office initially suggested more of the same tendency to back down. This past May (why is it always May?), I wrote about Wall Street’s “TACO trade”—short for “Trump Always Chickens Out”—in which stock traders bet against the president following through on tariff threats and then profiting when he folded and markets went up. And they were right, to an extent: Although Trump did impose extensive tariffs, the eventual levels were much lower than initially announced, thanks in part to lobbying by foreign governments. Trump’s resolve remains weak in some areas; he’s swung wildly on Ukraine and Russia, his position shifting depending on whom he last spoke to.

But in other ways, the pattern has started to break. Just ask Nicolás Maduro, who reportedly rejected negotiated exile in Turkey, perhaps wagering that Trump would never actually launch a military strike on Venezuela to capture him. It was a bad bet. Now Trump seems energized and has turned his attention to Greenland. U.S. allies—or people who until recently thought of themselves as allies—are scrambling to figure out how to react. Can they draw things out long enough for Trump to lose interest? Can they appease him somehow? Or do they need, as Eliot Cohen argued in The Atlantic this past weekend, to show a willingness to resist the United States militarily?

Trump is acting emboldened domestically too. He is once again threatening to invoke the Insurrection Act to deploy troops to Minneapolis, where he seems determined to immiserate the entire city. Before his first term, Trump had threatened to prosecute political rivals, but he was stymied by his aides during his presidency. This time, he’s going through with it. In a New Yorker profile this week of Representative LaMonica McIver, a New Jersey Democrat charged with assault for a fracas at an ICE facility, Representative Lateefah Simon, a California Democrat, said, “Typically, we would say, ‘Oh, they’re just trying to scare her.’” But this is much more than fearmongering: “They’re actively litigating this case,” Simon noted. (McIver has pleaded not guilty.)

Signs of new resistance have started to emerge in parallel with Trump’s newfound resolve. Republican members of Congress have begun pushing back—far less than one would expect even in a normal presidency, but more than in Trump’s previous term or in the early days of this one. They were able to force his hand on the Epstein files, though whether they have the courage to hold him to account for slow-walking the files’ release is not yet clear. As my colleague Anne Applebaum wrote yesterday, Congress will need to do much more to halt any Greenland fiasco. Foreign leaders will need to take a harder line too. When Trump was a pushover, it was more understandable, if not wiser, to wonder, What is the downside of humoring him? Now the downsides are clear and dangerous.

Here are three new stories from The Atlantic:

Trump’s Golden Age of Culture Seems Pretty Sad So Far

Trump’s return to office was widely portrayed as christening a new definition of chic. Young voters and voters of color had swung in his direction, thanks partly to the influence of podcasts, livestreams, and other media formats that now compete with traditional news outlets and cultural institutions. The attendance of tech barons, comedians, and content creators at Trump’s inauguration indicated that the so-called alternative media was now the mainstream—and openly pro-Trump. Its touchstones appeared to be recently booming phenomena including country music, TikTok tradwives, and mixed martial arts.

Trump quickly began consolidating his cultural power by focusing on the old media that hadn’t fallen in line.

Get inspired. Exercise isn’t just a break from sitting at a desk—it also acts as an extra twist to open the tap of creativity, Bonnie Tsui argues.

            <div id="article-text">In Princeton, New Jersey, a short stroll from the university you have heard of, there lies a little campus home to the Institute for Advanced Study. It was founded in 1930 not to confer degrees nor—God forbid!—to make money, nor even to conduct research toward any end in particular. The institute proclaims that its purpose is “the pursuit of knowledge for its own sake.”

Founder Abraham Flexner reckoned that brilliant minds, once freed to pursue “useless satisfactions,” would stumble upon discoveries of “undreamed-of utility,” as he wrote in a magazine a few years into the institute’s work. It seems to have worked for Albert Einstein, who had an office there. J. Robert Oppenheimer, too.

Enjoy this week’s useless satisfactions. I look forward to your theory of everything the week after.

And by the way, did you know that throughout the history of the Nobel Prizes, there have been years so turbulent that the Peace Prize committee determined not to confer an award, even as other categories went on?

This happened in a few of the interwar years as Nazi Germany rearmed, Italy invaded Ethiopia, and peace generally disintegrated. It was also the case for the years of World War I, with the exception of 1917, when the committee recognized the Red Cross for its humanitarian aid. (All of the Nobel Prizes were suspended during the early years of World War II.)

The circumstances were a bit different in 1948, when the committee ruled that “there was no suitable living candidate.” The clear message was that the award—which by rule cannot be given posthumously—should have gone to Mahatma Gandhi, assassinated earlier that year.

            <h2>The Real Reason for the Drop in Fentanyl Overdoses</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-01-20</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/2026/01/opioid-overdose-decrease-fentanyl-china/685683/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">For two decades, the United States and Canada have struggled with a drug epidemic. From 2003 to 2022, annual overdose deaths in the United States rose from less than 26,000 to nearly 108,000—becoming the leading nonmedical cause of death, surpassing car accidents and gun violence combined. In Canada, overdose deaths increased almost tenfold in the same period. In both countries, the surge in deaths was supercharged by “synthetic” opioids such as fentanyl, the ultra-potent, lab-made narcotic that has come to dominate the supply of hard drugs.

Then, sometime in 2023, something miraculous happened: Death rates started dropping. In Canada, opioid-overdose deaths declined 17 percent in 2024, then continued falling sharply in the first six months of 2025 (the most recent months for which data are available). In America, preliminary data indicate that total drug deaths fell from their peak of just shy of 113,000 in the year ending August 2023 to about 73,000 in the year ending August 2025.

Although the numbers are still too high, the public-health community has responded to the decrease with jubilation—and confusion. Overdoses had been rising inexorably for 20 years. What changed?

A new paper, published earlier this month by a group of drug-policy scholars in the journal Science, presents a novel theory. The paper’s authors attribute the reversal not to any American or Canadian policy, but to a sudden fentanyl “drought,” which they say may have its causes not in North America, but in China.

Nick Miroff: Fentanyl doesn’t come through the Caribbean

If right, their conclusion implies a disheartening lesson amid the otherwise-welcome news. Nothing American or Canadian policy makers did—no amount of law enforcement, harm reduction, or opioid-settlement funds—made deaths start falling, the paper implies. America and Canada’s drug problem might be in China’s hands.

The paper’s authors draw on a variety of data—drug potency, law-enforcement actions, and, cleverly, social-media posts—to study the supply of fentanyl over time. Most of what drug dealers sell on the street isn’t 100 percent pure fentanyl. Instead, dealers usually adulterate their drugs, combining fentanyl with inert powders such as sugar and baby powder, or mixing in other drugs to stretch the active ingredient. Recent years, for example, have seen a major increase in adulteration with the horse tranquilizer xylazine, which knocks users out but doesn’t satisfy the opioid craving. Such adulteration happens because users expect to pay the same amount for their drugs every time; dealers vary how much fentanyl they get for their dollar depending on how available the drug is. When purity goes down, it means the availability of fentanyl has, too.

Using data from the Drug Enforcement Administration, the paper’s authors observe that when overdose deaths began falling in mid-2023, the measured purity of fentanyl sold on the street began falling roughly in tandem. By the end of 2024, the data show, both overdose deaths and powder purity had fallen by about 50 percent—a dramatic concurrence.

The authors also look at DEA data on law-enforcement seizures of fentanyl, finding that these also slowed in the third quarter of 2023. This, they argue, is less attributable to any sort of strategy or personnel change and more to the fact that there appears to have been less fentanyl for law enforcement to seize. The authors also say that Canadian data, to the extent they are available, are consistent with this trend.

To further explore the possibility that fentanyl supply was plummeting, the authors also decided to look to an unusual source of data: Reddit forums dedicated to drugs‚ such as r/fentanyl. From 2021 to early 2023, “droughts” were rarely mentioned at all. But beginning in late 2023, the term drought starts showing up in dozens of posts a month, an increase of as much as 1,900 percent. In other words: Users were noticing a supply crash, too.

Droughts have been known to reduce overdose deaths. For example, Australia experienced a significant “heroin drought” in 2001. According to a 2024 study, the drought cut opioid-overdose deaths by somewhere from 36 to 56 percent among a cohort of people using illicit opioids.

But if a fentanyl drought had come to North America, what was causing it? The paper’s authors suggest that the answer may be related to a 2023 China crackdown on fentanyl-precursor chemicals and the online platforms that sold them, itself following a summit between President Biden and Xi Jinping. That crackdown in turn may have made it harder for Mexican producers, who usually source their precursors from the Chinese gray market, to manufacture the drug. But that’s more of a speculation than a definitive answer, Jonathan Caulkins, a professor of public policy at Carnegie Mellon University and co-author of the paper, told me.

“I’m much more comfortable with the idea that supply has become less abundant,” Caulkins said, adding that he’s fundamentally “puzzled what it was that could have produced such a long-lasting reduction.”

Clearer than what caused the drought is what didn’t cause it. As deaths fell, many pointed to their preferred policies. Nora Volkow, the longtime director of the National Institute on Drug Abuse, attributed the decline to the increased availability of the overdose-reversing drug naloxone, as well as steps taken by Congress and the Biden administration to make opioid-addiction medication more available. The Biden DEA administrator Anne Milgram claimed law enforcement’s share of the credit, saying her agency had successfully put “pressure” on the cartels.

These explanations were never that convincing. Reducing drug deaths through enforcement is notoriously hard. Naloxone seems to have had no discernible effect on fentanyl deaths, though it has reduced deaths caused by other, less potent opioids. And a massive study that deployed both harm-reduction and treatment interventions across 67 communities from 2021 to 2022 yielded no statistically significant reduction in overdose deaths. These approaches all might make small differences, but they can’t explain the big drop.

Nor, the paper’s authors note, can they explain the glaring fact that overdose deaths went down in both the United States and Canada, which have very different drug-control-policy approaches. “Both countries, despite very different policies, seem to be riding the same wave of broad trends in supply and use,” Caulkins said. Which leaves American and Canadian policy makers with something of a disappointing victory: Deaths are down, but they may yet come back, and preventing that turn may be far beyond American and Canadian control.

Listen: A radical answer to the fentanyl crisis

Though we don’t know why the drought happened, it still offers opportunity. In 2019, a multiagency operation shut down a handful of drug gangs in Philadelphia’s Kensington drug market at once, effectively imposing a drought through policy. A rigorous study later concluded that overdose deaths fell as a result, and the use of addiction-treatment medication in the surrounding Delaware Valley—an area covering parts of three states—increased. When their supply dries up, some people get off drugs; now is a great time to help them.

But there are risks, too. An uncertain drug supply can drive some users to substitute other substances—xylazine, or the latest illicit tranquilizer, medetomidine—that are dangerous in their own right. And sudden drops in the availability of opioids can reduce chronic users’ tolerance, leading them to take too much and overdose when the drugs come back.

If we want to lock in the unexpected windfall from the drought, now is the time to focus on getting people clean. That’s a big lift, but the right combination of medication, therapy, and voluntary and involuntary treatment can make a difference. If we do nothing, though, then one day fentanyl will come back—and there will be little anyone can do.</div>

            <h2>America’s Would-Be Surgeon General Says to Trust Your ‘Heart Intelligence’</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-01-20</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/2026/01/casey-means-surgeon-general-religion-spirituality/685682/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">For the past year, the United States has gone without its doctor. Ever since Vivek Murthy resigned as surgeon general last January, the role has remained empty despite President Trump’s attempts to fill it. He first nominated the physician Janette Nesheiwat but withdrew her nomination in May after reports that she completed her M.D. not in Arkansas, as she had claimed, but in St. Maarten. In her place, Trump nominated Casey Means, whose background is odd, to say the least.

Means is a Stanford Medicine graduate who dropped out of her surgical residency and has since made a career infusing spiritual beliefs into her wellness company, social-media accounts, and best-selling book. The exact nature of her spirituality is hard to parse: Means adopts an anti-institutionalist, salad-bar approach. She might share Kabbalah or Buddhist teachings, or quote Rumi or the movie Moana. She has written about speaking to trees and participating in full-moon ceremonies, both of which drew ridicule by the conservative activist and unofficial Trump adviser Laura Loomer. Her belief in “the divine feminine” (which she doesn’t quite explain) seems to have led her to renounce hormonal birth-control pills for halting the “cyclical life-giving nature of women.”

Although months have passed since her nomination, Means has still not appeared before Congress—in part because she went into labor with her first child hours before her confirmation hearing was scheduled to begin. (Means did not respond to questions for this story. A spokesperson for Bill Cassidy, who chairs the relevant Senate committee, told me that “the hearing will be rescheduled in the future when Dr. Means is ready” but did not offer a more detailed timeline.) The United States’ year without a surgeon general raises questions about how necessary the role really is. But the surgeon general still serves as the government’s leading spokesperson on public health, and if Means is eventually confirmed, her theology will become rather consequential because it is deeply tied to her beliefs about health. In 2024, she declared in a Senate roundtable on chronic disease that “what we are dealing with here is so much more than a physical health crisis. This is a spiritual crisis.” Part of her solution to both of these crises is to reject experts and institutions in favor of something far more alluring: intuition.

Means wrote in 2024 that she grew up in the Catholic faith, but left the Church in college. She grew fascinated by lectures at the Self-Realization Fellowship Lake Shrine, a spiritual center in Pacific Palisades, California. SRF, the religious organization behind it, was founded in 1920 by Paramahansa Yogananda, the “father of yoga in the West,” whose image graced the album cover of Sgt. Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band. It accepts the teachings of Jesus and other spiritual masters and divinities, but nothing is seemingly as important as one’s personal relationship with God. Yogananda’s book, The Second Coming of Christ, posits that the Second Coming is not necessarily literal, but instead entails an awakening of the divine consciousness in ourselves.

SRF’s influence is apparent in Means’s advice that people follow their “heart intelligence” and “divine intuition” and avoid “blindly ‘trusting the science.’” In a newsletter sponsored by a probiotic-supplement company, she wrote that “applying the scientific method to health and disease has immense utility for helping us understand the natural world and live healthy, longer lives, but it feels increasingly like there is a campaign being enacted against our divine gifts of intuition and heart intelligence.” In another newsletter, she wrote about the role of divine intuition in deciding whether to drink raw milk: She wants to be free to look a local farmer in the eye, “pet his cow, and then decide if I feel safe to drink the milk from his farm.” (One could very well have a lovely experience with a farmer, Kevin Klatt, a registered dietitian and research scientist at UC Berkeley, told me, “but it isn’t going to change the fact that raw milk might give you listeria.”)

In the same newsletter championing bovine contact, Means laments a spiritual crisis of connection to nature. She frequently portrays nature as a force with humanity’s best interests at heart, nearly synonymous with God. In her book, she suggests that chronic stress and trauma can be treated by, among other things, spending time in nature and through “plant medicine”—specifically, psilocybin-assisted therapy. (Means has also written that psychedelics helped her be “one with the moon.”) In that sponsored newsletter, she warned of a prophecy she says was put forth by the Indigenous Kogi people of Colombia, in which humanity has only until 2026 to prove we want to right the wrongs we have foisted upon the Earth, or we will all die. “I use the Kogi prophecy metaphorically,” she wrote. “But I do feel we are on a road to disaster. I think we should take these messages seriously.” Natural disasters, she implied, are a “communication from God.”

Nature worship might be especially appealing at a time when trust in experts is declining and technology has become ever more inscrutable and overwhelming, Alan Levinovitz, a professor of religion at James Madison University and the author of Natural: How Faith in Nature’s Goodness Leads to Harmful Fads, Unjust Laws, and Flawed Science, told me. Means’s appeal to nature and intuition, he said, is empowering because it puts expertise back into everyday Americans’ hands.

The ambiguity of Means’s spiritual views strengthens her appeal—they can be interpreted to fit a wide array of belief systems. Her 2024 New York Times best seller, Good Energy, uses terms such as energy and life force, along with scientific-sounding descriptions of metabolic processes, to insinuate that the vibes are off in the American diet and lifestyle. (Means wrote Good Energy with her brother, Calley, who is now a close adviser to Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the secretary of Health and Human Services.) In her newsletter, she encourages her readers to “avoid conventionally grown foods at all costs,” and warns that buying nonorganic food is a vote to “diminish the life force on this planet” while the use of synthetic pesticides “is giving a poor signal to God (Source!) that we want this miracle to continue.” (Source insinuates a godlike or all-powerful entity.) “She’s drawing on lots of different ideas very freely and without much rigor in ways that feel good,” Joseph Baker, a sociologist specializing in religion at East Tennessee State University, told me. “That sort of allows her to seem like a visionary without having to specify anything.”

Emily Hilliard, a press secretary for the Department of Health and Human Services, wrote in an email that religious and spiritual beliefs should not be held against anyone who seeks a government job, and that Means’s “credentials, research background, and experience in public life give her the right insights to be the surgeon general who helps make sure America never again becomes the sickest nation on earth.” The surgeon general has little power to enforce policy, but can call on Congress to put warnings on products like the ones seen on cigarette packets, release guidelines and reports, and lend support to various initiatives. Means’s belief system—which Baker characterized as a “sacralization of the individual”—suggests that she will use that platform to invite Americans to master their own health. In Good Energy, Means writes of chronic conditions such as depression, anxiety, infertility, insomnia, heart disease, erectile dysfunction, and cancer, “The ability to prevent and reverse these conditions—and feel incredible today—is under your control and simpler than you think.”

That statement is one of many in which Means echoes elements of manifestation: the belief that thinking good thoughts and putting in effort begets good things, which Means says is real. She advocates “tapping into the abundance that is a sheer law of our universe” and calling on a higher power—“When was the last time you simply sat quietly and asked God/spirit/ancestors/nature to help show you the way and guide you to your highest purpose?” she wrote in her newsletter—but also putting in the hard, hard work.

Means goes beyond intuition and heart intelligence to offer concrete suggestions for labor (and spending) that will be divinely rewarded—essentially, a reimagined prosperity gospel. The nature of that work is detailed in the penultimate section of Good Energy. Means recommends eating minimally processed and mostly organic foods, and taking regular cold plunges or showers. (In her newsletter, she also advises Americans to grow the majority of their food; instead of pets, they could “raise chickens and goats and have abundant eggs and milk.”) She includes checklists upon checklists of habits and tests that “enable Good Energy” (and recommends getting a comprehensive lab panel from Function Health, of which she was an investor). She suggests buying a glucose monitor through her own company, Levels, and also recommends various personal-care apps, water filters, and trackers for sleep, food, and activity. Some of these items are sold by the wellness company True Medicine, which helps customers use their health savings account for a wide range of purchases, and in which Means has invested; her brother co-founded it. According to financial disclosures made public in September, Means has also received more than $275,000 from supplement companies. (Means has pledged to divest from True Medicine and other wellness interests if she is confirmed.)

Besides potentially boosting her own bottom line, Means’s embrace of individualism in health is wholly unrealistic. Americans work longer hours than people in many other developed nations, and many don’t have enough time to cook dinner, let alone raise goats. Many of the most important nutrition victories over the past century, such as the fortification of foods and the removal of trans fats, were communal and systemic, Klatt, the dietitian and UC Berkeley researcher, told me—the type of science-backed, population-level interventions that Means hasn’t demonstrated much interest in. A different prospective surgeon general might recommend repeated visits with a dietitian and fight for insurance to cover them, instead of “advocating for this kind of woo-woo stuff that has no data behind it,” Klatt said. Means, though, “is not an individual who seems to be wedded to the scientific process,” Timothy Caulfield, a professor and the research director at the Health Law Institute at the University of Alberta, told me. “This is someone who seems to pull things out of thin air and then look for sciencey-sounding rhetoric” to support them.

Perhaps Means’s eventual confirmation hearing will clarify what, exactly, she intends to do as the face of American public health. But even she may not be sure. “The future of medicine will be about light,” Means wrote to her newsletter subscribers last year, before admitting, “I don’t exactly know how yet.”</div>

            <h2>What Iranians Want From Trump</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-01-20</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/international/2026/01/trump-khamenei-iran-protests/685680/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">When Shahrzad went to demonstrate in the streets of Tehran on January 2, she was buoyed by one fact: The day before, President Trump had promised that if Iran killed protesters, “the United States of America will come to their rescue.”

“We were all so hopeful,” the 29-year-old woman, who left Iran a few days ago for a nearby country, told me. Like many of those I spoke with for this article, she used a pseudonym for fear of reprisals against her family. “But when Khamenei started threatening us the day after, we were shit-scared. What if they came to a deal with Trump over our heads?”

In the two weeks since, the Iranian regime has committed its biggest atrocity since the 1980s, killing at least 3,919 protesters, according to the U.S.-based Human Rights Activist News Agency. Trump has yet to act on his promises, though he has repeated them several times. Many hope he might still intervene. But Trump has also disheartened Iranians by downplaying the regime’s violence. On Friday, he puzzlingly thanked Iran’s leaders for allegedly halting their planned execution of 800 protesters.

Over the years, I’ve often sought the opinion of Iranians for or against foreign intervention. And it has long been a contentious question that’s sharply divided the opponents of the Islamic Republic. But posing this question to about a dozen Iranians in recent days has yielded answers that feel strikingly new. First, most of those I spoke with favored one form or another of intervention by the United States. Second, many favored what would have been unthinkable not long ago: for Trump to take out Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei.

Melika, a 21-year-old Iranian student in Europe who left Iran a few weeks ago, strongly opposed the Israeli-American attacks on Iran last year. A socialist feminist who took part in the “Women, Life, Freedom” protests of 2022–23, she is generally skeptical of foreign intervention. But faced with the regime’s brutal violence over the past two weeks, she now can’t help but favor some kind of action from the U.S., especially given that Trump promised it.

“I’d frankly like Trump to kill Khamenei,” she told me. “I am worried about a broader war that would hurt Iran’s infrastructure. I wouldn’t like for us to become an Iraq, happy that Saddam is gone but becoming worse. But the Islamic Republic has to pay a price.” She speculated that killing Khamenei could heighten the power struggle inside the regime and perhaps stanch the repression and killing of protesters.

Mahsa Alimardani: How doubt became a weapon in Iran

Shahrzad told me that many of those who protested with her agreed. “The people of Iran would like to see a Venezuela-style operation,” she said, “even if it seems like a strange demand for Iran.”

She struggled to maintain her composure as we spoke. Two of her friends were killed last week, along with nine others known to her broader friend circle.

The sentiments of these young activists are shared by some internationally renowned opponents of the Iranian regime several decades their senior. The Nobel Peace Prize laureate Shirin Ebadi, the celebrated filmmaker Mohsen Makhmalbaf, the scholar Mohammad Javad Akbarin, and four others issued an open letter calling for what they termed a “humanitarian intervention.”

Akbarin is a supporter of Mir Hossein Mousavi, the former prime minister of the Islamic Republic whose reformist candidacy for the presidency touched off the 2009 Green Movement. Mousavi has been under house arrest since 2011. Until a few years ago, for someone from his political corner to demand an American hit on Khamenei would have been unthinkable. But Akbarin, now based in London, told me: “Ali Khamenei’s elimination is a necessary condition for any change in Iran. If he stays in power, more people will be killed following the next protests.”

Akbarin opposes wider measures, such as striking the bases of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, as Israel did in June. But he believes that taking out Khamenei would open a path for change, preferably led by domestic elements in Iran. “It will help us enter the transition period,” he said.

Gal Beckerman: The silence of the Left on Iran

Mostafa Saber, a Vancouver-based leader of a prominent left-wing Iranian party, does not share many political views with Akbarin but agreed with him on this point. “Regardless of what I think, many people in Iran want support from Trump,” he told me by phone. “They’d like him to hit Khamenei. This is what the people want. And if he does, this can benefit the revolution.”

Saber, too, doubts the utility of American military engagement beyond such an operation. “A broader military attack will help the Islamic Republic and hurt the revolution,” he said. “We oppose such intervention. An all-out war will surely benefit the Islamic Republic. They will militarize the atmosphere.”

He pointed to this past summer’s 12-day war with the U.S. and Israel, which paused domestic actions, such as a nationwide truck-driver strike that was then under way. “But to take out Khamenei,” as Trump did with the IRGC leader Qassem Soleimani, “is a different matter,” he said. “Khamenei’s loss will take cohesion out of the Islamic Republic and will add to the people’s morale.”

Some activists have a different view of what sort of action Trump should take, however. Ali Vakili, an activist in New York City with extensive contacts in Iran, expressed reservations about an American hit on Khamenei. The supreme leader “shouldn’t be a martyr,” Vakili told me. “The people of Iran should decide his fate themselves.”

Vakili told me that he’d rather see the U.S. hit IRGC bases, and that “U.S. jets should remain in Iranian skies for a while” so that people might feel that the United States is really behind them. Maybe such a threat could force the regime to change its behavior—or even lead it to transition Khamenei and those close to him out of power in favor of more technocratic elements.

The consensus for foreign intervention among those I spoke with was wider spread and more politically diverse than ever before, in my experience, but it was by no means unanimous. Elahe Ejbari, a student activist who fled Iran in 2022, started a counterpetition to the one that Ebadi and Akbarin signed. Ejbari’s petition supports the people’s movement against the regime but declares that “tying the destiny of Iranian popular struggles to foreign intervention is dangerous and irresponsible.”

Arash Azizi: Change may be coming to Iran

“History shows us that foreign intervention in the global South will never lead to freedom,” she told me by phone from Germany. Even a direct hit on Khamenei, she said, “will only make the region more insecure.”

Another statement, signed by 14 luminaries including the popular journalist and scholar Alireza Rajaee, condemns both the regime’s violence and “any foreign intervention in our dear country Iran.” It warns that unless “fundamental peaceful change” is brought about by Iran’s rulers, “more difficult changes will become inevitable.”

Ultimately, Iran’s next chapter will be the outcome not only of what America does or does not do but also of the interactions among regional actors, protesters, and the regime’s web of factions. How these will unfold is all but impossible to predict.

But one thing is clear. Until a few years ago, millions of Iranians repeatedly voted in the country’s mostly unfree elections, hoping that regime insiders could pave a path for reform. They wouldn’t have dreamed of demanding change from American bombers or drones, or of asking the U.S. president to please kill the supreme leader for them.

Khamenei’s obstinate refusal to effect any meaningful change and his bloody massacre of civilians in droves have brought Iranians to this point. The grand ayatollah has brought them only death, disaster, and misery, and so they are desperately seeking a way out—by any means necessary.</div>

The farmers absolutely are selling the water, a truckload at a time to weed farmers.

We shouldn&#39;t allow them to sell it, but we also shouldn&#39;t force them to use it. We could just do neither thing!

California has a water surplus right now. We only use 8% of our water on residential. Last year we were letting the excess go out of our reservoirs because we had them topped off. This year will be the same. The snow pack is healthy and we just had several massive storms in rapid succession that set water fall records. And that&#39;s without a bunch of new things we&#39;re doing to maintain more of the rain instead of letting it go into the ocean. We currently have 10 years of capacity in case of a worst case scena

Actually, about half is used for &quot;environmental&quot; purposes, which is to say, it is allowed to flow out to the sea. Agriculture is the second biggest category, but there would be no shortage in our lifetimes without the &quot;environmental&quot; part.

There is no such thing as a tragedy of the commons.

It was invented by a eugenicist [craphound.com].

Someone [indiana.edu] looked at the facts regarding his claim, and it turns out that Garrett Hardin was wrong [investopedia.com].  Who would have thought.

It only becomes a tragedy as soon as someone puts a price on commons.  In other words, the problems start when the commons are privatised.  When they stop being commons.

but the concept of the &quot;global water&quot; anything is nonsense.That&#39;s right. water doesn&#39;t flow into the ocean and mix around then evaporate back into the air to repeat the cycle.

That&#39;s only what the woke DEI universities want you to think.
If you can drink saltwater and brackish water, then you don&#39;t have to worry.  But when people somewhere else can&#39;t drink the water there, some of them will come to where you are and overuse your fresh water.  Saudi Arabia banned the growing of food for cattle, and instead imports it from farms in Arizona.  China gets almonds from California.  Since global migration exists, and global food shipments exist, there is at some level a global market for fresh water.  There are thoughtful logical ways to take care of this, and if they are not extremely profitable for someone, they might never come to pass.

I learned that you&#39;re a pathetic Trump sycophant. Don&#39;t know how valuable (or new) that is.

Right now, no conversation about Greenland exists in a vacuum. That NYPost story was part of an effort to gin up some sort of rationale for Trump&#39;s obsession with Mercator projections, and you fucking fell for it.

The point of the ICWA note is that the Greenlanders are not going to to look to the US to save them from past Danish awfulness, because they are not stupid. They know that the US can be just as awful, and has

You’re wrong in your question.  Number one, Venezuela is a major source, and the reason why is the following – and I’ve seen a lot of this reporting, and it’s fake reporting and I’ll tell you why.

More like YOU do not know what you are talking about. Not a surprise, really. But here is the thing, willful ignorance does not solve problems.

But it&#39;s delivered as storms and floods, so making the situation even worse.

Funny story, most populations are shrinking. Even in places like China and India. Google China overcount of population for an eye opener.

Factor in the large data centers with their massive cooling requirements, water shortages will become even more severe. And that doesn&#39;t even address the electrical requirements to run these facilities which have their own needs. A number of them are currently being installed and planned for areas in the southwest where drought conditions have been in effect for years.

There is no &quot;collapse&quot;, because rainfall continues just fine. What we have - and this is nothing new - are populations pumping aquifers faster than rain refills them. Rivers being pumped dry.

In the US, this has been an issue for decades in the Southwest. It is the primary reason that some coral islands are in trouble - again, for decades now.

Polluted rivers - also a long-standing problem, especially in Asia, but also elsewhere.

So, yes, a real problem. But do we have to have clickbait? &quot;Global boiling&quot;

But do we have to have clickbait? &quot;Global boiling&quot;, &quot;Water bankruptcy&quot;, the world is ending tomorrow?Yes. We have to. Because it&#39;s not about crisis, it&#39;s about leading the charge (and getting rich doing it) against crisis. You can&#39;t lead the charge against crisis if there is no crisis. There will - literally - always be another crisis, 100% of the time. There&#39;s far too much money involved.

There will - literally - always be another crisis, 100% of the time. There&#39;s far too much money involved.

The question of water resources is a well known problem, referred to for as &quot;The Century of water&quot; (21th Century&#39;s major issue will be water access, wars and global migrations related to lack of water). Similar reports were all over the press in the early 2000s. The situation hasn&#39;t changed, only the urgency to act increased.

Water shortage is both a) obvious, b) fixable with restraint, and c) fixable with science.

A) It&#39;s not a new or argued problem, it is obvious.  There are no conspiracy idiots claiming it is a hoax.  We know about and politicians on all sides want to fix it.  For this reason there is already a massive amount of people working on the issue with little to no political issues.

B) The main reason for the water crisis is not really human population growth, but human greed.  We can cut back on the really stupid things like data center use and the thirsty crops in drought prone areas.  It is stupid to plant almonds in California and if things get really bad we can cut those trees down.   If we have to cut our alfalfa, cotton and sugarcane use, it will affect us but not wipe us out.  Rice is an issue - we really need it despite the water costs so that might cause some problems.

C) Finally, we are making huge strides in desalination.   In the past 30 years, the cost has dropped to about a third of what it used to be.  More importantly, it is both a electrical power intensive technology AND can be run in off hours.  We can easily co-locate solar power plants directly on top of desalination plants, turning seawater into drinkable water during sunny days and literally storing it for a rainy day.

This IS an issue.  We need to watch it.  But it is not a scary doomsday event.

70% of the planet us covered in it.It just needs to be desalinated.California recently had atmospheric rivers washing it away.The Thwaites Glacier is moving into the Southern Ocean and causing sea levels to rise.

It just needs to be desalinated.For variable values of &quot;just&quot;. You of simple minds always think everything you do not understand is easy to do. In actual reality that is rarely the case.

For variable values of &quot;just&quot;. You of simple minds always think everything you do not understand is easy to do. In actual reality that is rarely the case.

AI god is the only one who will make the Malthusian problems go away, human technology and fucks to give have hit their limit.

In western countries water is pumped from a source (wells or rivers, etc), pumped through pipes, and then fast tracked into the nearest body of water and ultimately the oceans. Treating it for reuse is what we need - itâ(TM)s basically reusable an infinite number of times. Rain runoff is also fast tracked into the nearest ocean - I wonder what role that plays in ground water depletion?

            <div id="article-text">If it&#39;s sensible, you&#39;ll probably get paid out. People would still do it.

Makes a lot more sense to put up a barrier to entry than to scrap the whole thing.

Indeed. A good dev will use AI to submit a better PR. A bad dev will use AI to submit more PRs. If the goal is getting a PR that hits the money ball, guess which strategy works better? If the boss isn&#39;t a programmer, guess which dev gets favored?

That&#39;s not what AI have been sold as. They have been sold on the premise that AIs are more intelligent than that.

No, the AI is capable of producing good results, but as it doesn&#39;t know anything, it doesn&#39;t know when it has done that. The problem is when the person who initiated the AI pushes the human review labor off onto some other person. If you&#39;re going to use an AI, you should have to review its output before some other human has to experience it.

No, the AI is capable of producing good results, but as it doesn&#39;t know anything, it doesn&#39;t know when it has done that.

You are indeed repeating my point. If the AI is not capable of judging the value of its own work, then what intelligence does the &quot;I&quot; refer to?

For example, I can go to my library and choose a book which contains a solution to a differential equation I want for some purpose. I must verify that the solution is suitable.

Is the book intelligent because it has a record of the solution? Clearly not. Did the book produce good work for me? No, since I did the work of checking the solution.

Is the library intelligent because I can &quot;ask&quot; it for the book, by scanning the titles in alphabetical order? Clearly not. Did the library produce good work because its books are in alphabetical order? No, since I did the work of checking the solution.

If I ask an &quot;artificial intelligence&quot; to solve a differential equation for some purpose, I should expect a suitable solution. If all I get is a page from a book and I have to check that the page is suitable for the stated purpose, then I am doing the work and the &quot;I&quot; in &quot;AI&quot; is a misnomer.

The intelligence would refer to how often it makes decent output based on the input.

It&#39;s obviously better at that than anything we&#39;ve had before, but even if it gives a qualitative result 90% of the times, that means it&#39;s completely not suited to tackle bigger problems without having a human constantly weed out those 10% of bad answers.

And not sure if you&#39;ve used AI for programming, but it does have some capabilities & &#39;creativity&#39;. In some way it obviously is a next generation, more natural, search eng

The problem is even more obvious: Every correct bug report created using AI can be created by the authors themselves. Why should a thirdparty know better how to run the AI on the code than the authors? Posting AI generated bugreports basically says &quot;I think the project members are too stupid to use AI&quot;.

can&#39;t they use captchas to prevent the AI bug reports or can AI solve those too now?

GPT-1 could bypass a Captcha faster than a human so no it wouldn&#39;t work.

No problem, curl surely implements wget:// somewhere.

If the motive of the sloppers is the bounty, this might stem the deluge.

But, I can think of other motives why people would want to impede cURL&#39;s security.

I&#39;m sure some of it for the reward money.

Now, to play devil&#39;s advocate: If I had a fat juiciy bug that I was using to start exploits, for sure I&#39;d try and tie up the project maintainers with AI bug reports. What better way to distract them? Keep them looking at the crap and hope it turns everyone&#39;s attention away from the real thing.

AI is just a tool. Like all tools is can be (a) used for good, (b) used for evil, (c) used to look at porn or (d) try and make money with little to no effort.

If you follow Daniel on Mastodon, you&#39;ve seen him talking about the avalanche of complete bogus AI-reports he gets and the ever increasing time he has to spend dealing with them.

Enshittification of bug bounty platforms - a decade ago when many of the big platforms were starting, there were promises of pre-screening and helping to organize the inflow of reports. I&#39;m guessing that&#39;s only for &quot;premium&quot; accounts only these days.

It&#39;s not a sustainable way to do application security testing.

Bad decision. They should have started charging a deposit for bug registration instead. Ideally, the deposit should be twice the cost of the analysis. If there is no bug, the deposit is taken, and a new deposit is required for the next bug registration. If there is a bug, the deposit is kept and a bonus is paid. In this case, the fake bug registrants will pay for the work of good programmers.

If they start taking monetary payments then they have to become a legal merchant with all the time, cost and hassle that entails.

That&#39;s not unusual, of course.But apparantly one of the original developers doesn&#39;t want it to die.

AFAIK Stadia is a greek unit of length, maybe once around the track in the original olympics?

Google Stadia controllers originally communicated directly to Stadia with wifi. When Google shut down the Stadia service, they published a tool for converting controllers to work over bluetooth as a normal controller device. This allows us to reuse these controllers instead of sending them to landfill.

The U.S. may have moved on to another immigration crisis, but Mahmoud Khalil, the Columbia University graduate student who was arrested last spring after participating in pro-Palestine protests, is still in the middle of his legal battle. Khalil was taken into custody in March, after Secretary of State Marco Rubio invoked a rarely used mechanism in federal immigration law that claimed that the student’s actions would have “potentially serious adverse foreign policy consequences for the United States.” The 30-year-old green-card holder was detained for three months, missing the birth of his first child, but was released in June. Last week, the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals issued a devastating blow to Khalil’s case: A three-judge panel dismissed his habeas corpus petition challenging the federal government’s attempts to detain and deport him.

In a 2–1 decision, the court ruled that the lower district court of New Jersey—which had ordered Khalil to be released from immigration detention in June—did not have jurisdiction to consider his habeas petition. The panel’s majority declared that these petitions challenging a final order of removal can be heard only in immigration court, a system overseen by the attorney general, who also handpicks immigration judges.

Khalil essentially has one option left before being forced to go through immigration court: request a rehearing en banc. If that is approved, all 14 judges on the 3rd Circuit would hear Khalil’s case. But not only does the current makeup of this particular court lean conservative; it received a notable new member last year—Emil Bove. A former defense attorney for President Donald Trump and the former deputy attorney general, Bove has been mired in controversy throughout his tenure in the second Trump administration.

To make sense of Khalil’s options, I spoke with Elora Mukherjee. A professor at Columbia Law School and director of the school’s Immigrants’ Rights Clinic, Mukherjee submitted an amicus brief in defense of Khalil, along with other students, scholars, and professors who have been charged under the same foreign-policy deportability ground that Khalil currently faces. Our conversation has been edited and condensed for clarity.

Shirin Ali: Before we get into the 3rd Circuit’s latest opinion, can you bring us up to speed on how exactly Khalil’s case ended up there?

Elora Mukherjee: On the night that Khalil was wrongly arrested, detained, and targeted for his speech—peaceful speech that should be protected by the First Amendment—he was initially detained at his apartment in graduate student housing at Columbia University. That night, his lawyers immediately filed a federal habeas petition for him with the Southern District of New York.

But by the time that petition was formally filed in federal court, Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents had already transferred Khalil to a detention center in northern New Jersey. For that reason, the initial federal judge assigned to Khalil’s case in SDNY found that he didn’t have jurisdiction to hear the habeas petition. Instead, he transferred it to the New Jersey federal district court. That transfer was done over the objection of the federal government, which argued that because Khalil was detained in Louisiana, the case should be either dismissed outright or transferred to the federal district court for the Western District of Louisiana.

The federal government again tried to get Khalil’s case transferred to Louisiana by filing a motion with the New Jersey district court but was denied. Eventually, the question [of who should hear the case] landed with the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.

And what do you make of the circuit court’s latest opinion?

The decision is wrong. It was a split decision with two judges in the majority and one judge in the dissent. Judges Thomas Hardiman and Stephanos Bibas were in the majority—President George W. Bush appointed Hardiman, and Trump appointed Bibas during his first term. The majority interprets provisions of immigration law that were introduced with the 1996 Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act as stripping federal courts of jurisdiction to hear the constitutional claims of individuals like Khalil, who are alleging that their rights are being irreparably harmed.

According to these two judges, Khalil is not eligible to file a federal habeas petition. The only recourse available to him is to raise any defenses that he has, first in his immigration court proceedings before the Board of Immigration Appeals, then to the federal circuit court that has jurisdiction over the immigration court that initially heard his removal proceedings—in this case, the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals.

This is exactly what the Trump administration wants. The government has claimed that the jurisdiction stripping provisions of the IIRAIRA are broad in cases over the years, but that position has consistently been rejected in federal courts—including, most recently, in the U.S. Supreme Court, in Jennings v. Rodriguez, a case from 2018. In the Jennings case and in similar cases, the Supreme Court and other federal courts have consistently affirmed that federal courts have jurisdiction to hear habeas claims.

If the right to habeas corpus is enshrined in the U.S. Constitution, how can the 3rd Circuit essentially take that away from Khalil?

This is what much of this litigation has been about. The Trump administration’s position is that there should be only one proceeding, and the only proceeding that Khalil is entitled to contest is in Louisiana immigration court. Once he loses in immigration court, he can appeal that to the Board of Immigration Appeals. Once he loses at the BIA, he can appeal that to the relevant federal circuit court, which for him, the administration would argue, is the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals. That would be the administration’s position because Khalil was detained for the longest period of time in the Western District of Louisiana, and Louisiana is where the immigration judge issued the removal order against him.

In my view, and the position of reasonable people across party lines who care about the rule of law, is that federal habeas proceedings must be available to individuals who are targeted by the executive branch in violation of basic constitutional protections. There is a doctrine that allows for people to go to federal court and file habeas petitions when their constitutional rights have been violated, and it doesn’t require waiting months or years to first exhaust the immigration court proceedings, waiting again for the BIA to rule, and finally getting to a federal circuit court of appeals. By that point in time, Khalil could have been detained for months or years, during which time he would have suffered irreparable harm because of the Trump administration’s violation of his First Amendment rights.

The quick summary of this doctrine is this: If a person is suffering irreparable harm affecting their constitutional rights, then they should be able to seek relief through federal habeas court proceedings without first needing to wait months or years for their immigration proceedings to be exhausted.

Can Khalil appeal the 3rd Circuit’s decision? What options does he have now?

He can request a rehearing en banc with the 3rd Circuit, which is an opportunity for all the judges on the court to rehear his case. The full en banc panel could request a new briefing on these issues from both sides, asking what they think about the panel decision that was issued last week, and it would be extremely likely to have oral arguments. All the judges on the court would have a chance to weigh in on the en banc court’s final opinion, or opinions, as there would likely be a split decision from the 3rd Circuit, given the makeup of that court.

Through the Biden administration, the 3rd Circuit was considered a swing court, in that its makeup was about half appointees from Democratic presidents and about half appointees by Republican presidents. In the last year or so of the Biden administration, there was an opportunity to appoint a judge to the circuit that would result in the court being composed of a slight majority of federal judges appointed by Democratic presidents. Unfortunately, as the Biden administration ended, it left a vacant seat on the 3rd Circuit, and last year that seat was filled by Emil Bove.

If the en banc’s majority also ends up ruling against Khalil, at that point he would have the option of appealing to the U.S. Supreme Court. If the Supreme Court grants cert in Khalil’s case and issues an opinion, it would likely have consequences for other noncitizen students and scholars who have spoken out against the Trump administration. It also could have broader consequences for noncitizens who are trying to seek habeas relief after they have been wrongly arrested and detained by the executive branch.

While this case has been unfolding, Khalil has had a separate legal challenge active in Louisiana’s immigration court. What’s going on with that one?

This is very confusing, because there are multiple proceedings taking place simultaneously. So there is a proceeding in immigration court in Louisiana, and that is taking place before an agency called the Executive Office for Immigration Review. It’s housed within the Department of Justice and is presided over by an immigration judge. This is one track that was proceeding at the same time the federal habeas proceedings were going forward in the District of New Jersey.

My understanding is that his case is currently pending before the Board of Immigration Appeals. I don’t know what the briefing schedule is, but it’s worth mentioning that over the past year the Trump administration has fired or reassigned all the reasonable members of the BIA. In 2025, I believe, with one exception, dozens and dozens of cases and opinions issued by the board almost uniformly narrowed the protections available to noncitizens. So there are real questions about whether the BIA is still a meaningful administrative appellate body.

Immigration judges here are also hired by the attorney general, but over the past year, more than 100 immigration judges who didn’t toe the administration’s party line have been fired—they don’t have any of the protections, such as life tenure, that one expects of federal judges. And in hiring announcements for what has historically been called immigration judges, the administration is now calling them deportation judges. The Trump administration is very clear about what it wants these administrative law officers to do. Lastly, the federal district court in the Western District of Louisiana has, the last time I checked, the lowest grant rate for federal habeas petitions in the country. Plus, the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals is known for being the least likely federal appeals court to protect people’s civil rights.

Five years ago, and to his enduring credit, Louisiana Sen. Bill Cassidy voted to convict Donald Trump on an impeachment charge of “incitement of insurrection.” In a brief statement afterward, Cassidy said, “I voted to convict Trump because he is guilty.”

Cassidy, representing a deep-red state and at the time still ascending toward a committee chairmanship and a meaningful tenure in the Senate, had the most to lose politically of the seven Republicans who voted to convict Trump. He had, however, just won reelection in 2020. He may have bet that Trump would simply disappear into the shadows of American political life before Cassidy had to stand before voters again.

As we are all more aware with each passing minute, that bet was wrong. And lest anyone think that Trump might forgive something like an impeachment vote against him, he quashed that over the weekend when he prospectively endorsed GOP Rep. Julia Letlow in a primary against Cassidy, urging, “RUN, JULIA, RUN!!!,” on his social media account.

Letlow announced her candidacy Tuesday morning. The key lines of her launch video, which features a great many photos of Trump, or of herself with Trump: “A state as conservative as ours? We shouldn’t have to wonder how our senator will vote when the pressure is on.”

Cassidy, in a statement Tuesday, said that Letlow had called him before her announcement and “said she respected me and that I had done a good job.”

He added, “I will continue to do a good job when I win re-election.”

His confidence may not be well placed. Cassidy, who entered the Senate in 2015, was censured by his party following his Trump conviction vote. A Trump endorsement in a GOP primary, in a very red state, means the world, and Letlow is not a gadfly candidate. If Cassidy still wants to have a meaningful tenure in the Senate, he should treat this year as his last. Because there’s a great chance it is.

The senator, who also failed to endorse Trump in 2024, has since done everything he can to win the president’s favor—or at least his indifference. That included absorbing oceans of criticism for his role in supporting one of Trump’s key nominees with whom Cassidy was plainly uncomfortable. Trump must have enjoyed watching him twist in the wind this way for the past year just as much as he enjoys turning on those just as they get their hopes up that he won’t. It’s another warning to anyone who ever might think they’re safe from a change in Trump’s mood.

Those familiar with his campaign-rally routines will know Trump’s many recitations of “The Snake,” something he refers to as a poem but is really a song from the 1960s. The lyrics are about a woman who takes a snake into her home and is then bit by it, to which the snake says, “You knew damn well I was a snake before you took me in.” Trump has long used this as a metaphor against lax immigration policies, while everyone else observes that it’s a form of projection and a warning to those who put their trust in Trump.

Cassidy seemed to believe that he could get over the hurdle with Trump in the first year of Trump’s second presidency and at least win his neutrality in a GOP Senate primary. Most notably, Cassidy, despite being a physician who was visibly disgusted with vaccine conspiracy theorist Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s nomination to head the Department of Health and Human Services, cast the key vote to confirm Kennedy in the Senate Finance Committee last year. Cassidy did so after receiving a variety of “assurances” from Kennedy that he wouldn’t make all sorts of ruptures to mainstream public health, which Kennedy has gone on to do anyway.

And while Cassidy has been more and more critical of Kennedy over the past year—to no apparent avail—he’s otherwise moved in lockstep with Trump. The pinned posts on both his official and personal X accounts show him beside the president in the Oval Office as Trump signs a MAGA hat for him. You will not see him entertaining defecting Trump on any floor votes or criticizing episodes of executive imperialism. Even for the one issue on which he has spent some capital—criticizing Kennedy—he does it by trying to drive a wedge between Kennedy and Trump. He noted in a September hearing with Kennedy, for instance, that Kennedy has been sharply critical of COVID vaccines, whereas Trump should win the Nobel Peace Prize for his role in their development.

On a surface level, Cassidy’s sucking up appeared to be paying dividends. Months came and went without Trump endorsing an opponent. Politico asserted, first in an article in September, that things were “looking up” for Cassidy and again, just last week, that Trump was not expected to make an endorsement in either the Louisiana or Texas GOP Senate primaries.

This may have all been a ruse to get through the peak governing season in Trump’s first two years, as the president needed Cassidy as an ally on major nominations and legislation. The New York Times reported over the weekend that Trump first met with Letlow last March and told her that she would have his support if she challenged Cassidy. “But,” the Times added, “he said he would have to lie low for the time being to avoid a repeat of Mr. Trump’s clashes with former Senator Mitt Romney of Utah, who routinely broke with the president, including on his vote to remove him from office.”

Cassidy gave the suck-up routine the old college try, but ultimately, the snake did its snake thing. Cassidy now has the choice to either try to out-Trump the Trump-endorsed candidate in the race or accept Trump’s rationale in endorsing Letlow—now that he doesn’t need Cassidy’s help in Congress anymore—and stop offering it.

Cassidy ought to take a look at North Carolina’s Thom Tillis, one of his fellow GOP senators from the 2015 freshman class, and note how much more enlivened and central to the discussion he is now that he’s unshackled from electoral considerations. The country is in a dangerous place right now. The Senate could use another adult voice.

The Supreme Court heard arguments over state-level bans on trans athletes competing in public schools last week. Though it’s hard to imagine the conservative-majority court calling the bans “discriminatory,” trans athletes and allies have reason to hope for a narrow ruling, rather than an expansion of the existing laws.

Over the past week, the Trump administration has escalated its attacks on Minnesota officials and protesters who oppose its immigration crackdown in the Twin Cities. Federal officials have claimed that Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey are terrorists, and lobbed the same charge against slain protester Renee Good. Donald Trump’s Justice Department has also opened an investigation into Walz and Frey, issuing subpoenas to Democratic officials on Tuesday. The expanding probe appears to lay the groundwork for potential criminal charges against both men for obstructing federal immigration enforcement. It follows Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche’s declaration last week that Walz and Frey are engaged in outright “terrorism,” promising to stop it “by any means necessary.”

On this week’s episode of Amicus, Mark Joseph Stern spoke with Julia Gegenheimer about the rapidly expanding definition of terrorism, obstruction, and other charges that the government is weaponizing against political opponents. Gegenheimer is special litigation counsel at Georgetown Law’s Institute for Constitutional Advocacy and Protection and previously served at the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division. An excerpt from their conversation, below, has been edited for length and clarity.

Mark Joseph Stern: You spent years working on cases involving domestic terrorism and extremist violence. Is this what happens when almost anyone can be classified as a “terrorist” and any opposition to the government, including protected First Amendment activities, can be classified as “terrorism”?

Julia Gegenheimer: I think it’s important here, when we talk about domestic terrorism, to take a step back and look at what we actually mean when we use that term. It’s being thrown around a lot in common parlance to stand in for people who are opposed to this administration or its policies, or who are protesting this administration, or who seek to hold it accountable. But federal law actually defines domestic terrorism. Under the law, domestic terrorism involves activities that are “dangerous to human life,” that are in violation of federal criminal law—and, on top of that, have the intent to intimidate a population, or to affect the “conduct” or “policy” of a government by “intimidation or coercion.”

Even then, domestic terrorism is not itself a federal crime. You have to have an underlying federal criminal violation, then these additional layers of motivation or intent stack on top of it. So the impact of throwing this term around very loosely is to threaten criminal punishment for conduct that falls far, far short of what federal law would actually look at as domestic terrorism.

We’ve seen the president and his allies calling these protesters “terrorists.” We’ve seen the government treating protesters like Renee Good much as they treated the fishermen in international waters, whom they bombed without any semblance of due process. It feels to me like an escalation to then accuse elected local and state leaders of terrorism.

It is profoundly disturbing. And the reason why this feels different to you is that it is a bit of a different flavor. It’s pitting the federal government against the states and creating tension where it doesn’t need to be. And frankly, it’s implicitly encouraging acts of political violence against these elected officials by turning them into the enemy.

So we have the Trump administration falsely accusing state and local leaders of encouraging political violence—and, in the process, actually encouraging political violence against the people they’re defaming.

Sure. We’ve seen this throughout history, even recent history: When you put people in opposition like that—when you portray them as the enemy, when you describe them as kind of threatening a person’s way of life or things that they hold dear—that creates the conditions under which people are more likely to resort to political violence, and it becomes more and more the norm.

It feels very much of a piece with the Trump administration treating blue states as the enemy of the federal government and even the American people. The administration is shutting off federal funds to blue states, canceling projects within blue states, trying to suppress the votes of blue state residents. It’s direct hostility and antagonism toward the half of the country that didn’t vote for Trump. It’s also a refusal to acknowledge the legitimacy of whom those people did vote for, including Tim Walz.

It seems to me that it leads to a really dark place when the federal government can almost declare war on a state because it didn’t go for him in the most recent election. Then occupy that state with federal agents who are actively hostile and in fact violent toward the local community.

Officials in this administration have been explicit that they are targeting blue states. We’ve seen the surges in Minnesota, Chicago, and Washington, D.C. The reasoning behind that has been that these are traditionally blue states or Democratic areas. It doesn’t take too much reading between the lines to see that that’s what’s going on.

In his address to Minnesotans, Gov. Tim Walz urged residents to bear witness and help to create a record. That record, of course, will be vital in prosecutions, should they ever happen. But at the same time, the Trump administration is telling citizens that following or recording ICE officers is a federal crime and maybe even domestic terrorism. That it’s an obstruction of law enforcement to follow federal agents and to document what they are doing. Is that true?

No. The act of observing and recording officers from a safe distance, including when they are making an arrest, is something that has been long- and well-recognized as protected by the First Amendment.

Could you explain why? There’s a wrinkle here because smartphones are 21st-century technology that the Framers couldn’t possibly have conceived of. But it does seem like this is bedrock First Amendment stuff, right? The First Amendment isn’t just billionaires buying an election. I would think that in a democracy, regular people have a right, if not a duty, to document what public officials are doing on the job, very much including armed agents of the state. Is that something the law bears out?

Yes. Cellphone recordings of ICE activity connect back to these really fundamental principles that the First Amendment was designed to protect. They’re connected to the idea that people have a right to know what their government is doing so they can express views on what their government is doing and protest peacefully against it.

            <div id="article-text">All weekend long, the headlines out of Minneapolis have captured a moment that is by turns alarming and bizarre.

For instance, in the wake of the killing of Renee Good by Immigration and Customs Enforcement, protesters have been gathering at a federal building out by the airport in the bitter cold. Police have greeted them with chemical irritants.

Meanwhile, downtown, a pardoned Jan. 6 rioter tried to stage a protest in support of the Trump administration. But his small group was quickly overwhelmed—and pelted with water balloons. Locals blasted music from the movie Frozen and carried signs reading “ICE out of Minnesota.”

Around the time that Jan. 6–er was getting soaked, What Next host Mary Harris hopped on a call with Keith Ellison, the state’s attorney general. On a recent episode of What Next, the two discussed the challenging situation in Minneapolis, why it may take time to bring charges over Good’s killing, and how Ellison is standing up to President Donald Trump. This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.

Mary Harris: I want to talk about what your office has been doing in the wake of the killing of Renee Good. You’re working with a local prosecutor to beseech the public to send you evidence in this case, and evidence more generally of how immigration enforcement is going down in the state of Minnesota?

Keith Ellison: Yeah, two different portals. One is through the Hennepin County attorney’s office for evidence concerning the death of Good, and the other one is just general information on what ICE is doing, what they’re up to. And they’re for two separate reasons. One is going to help us determine whether it would be appropriate to file charges against Jonathan Ross, and that decision has not been made yet. And I don’t want people to worry. It is the practice for criminal investigations to first investigate, then make a charging decision.

It’s been days since Renee Good was killed. Many people have seen the video of her death through multiple angles, multiple different videos. Can you explain to me as a lawyer why the evidence I’ve seen is not sufficient to at least impanel a grand jury to consider charges against the officer who shot her?

The reason is very simple. Evidence is being gathered as quickly as possible. The final autopsy is not even done yet, and it might not be done in the normal course of events yet. But also, the local FBI, under the direction of the federal government, has been told to deny the state access to the car, which includes the windows that could show the trajectory of bullets, the shell casings, and the gun.

Wouldn’t bringing charges mean that you had to have access to that evidence? Maybe a judge would say you have to?

Well, look, you want to have the best case before you file charges. You may still need to do some discovery demands.

You mentioned this other portal, the fact that you’re also seeking information about how immigration enforcement is behaving in general in Minneapolis and in Minnesota. And I have to say that over the past week, I’ve seen so much troubling information coming out of Minneapolis. I’ve seen reports of protestors talking about being thrown in cars, being groped by ICE agents, being called names. There are people being told: “Didn’t you see what happened to that woman?” Are you seeing prosecutable behavior when you see these things?

Yeah—they say it in the most disgusting terms, by the way. It’s not just “Didn’t you see what happened to that woman?” It’s “Didn’t you see what happened to that effing …,” then there’s an expletive about her sexual orientation. It’s just the nastiest, most revolting, insulting way possible. We’ve seen all of that and more.

But one of the challenges we have right now is that prosecutors do not do investigations; police do them. And, quite frankly, it’s simply outside the experience and culture of police to arrest federal agents, because usually federal agents are doing what the statute says they’re supposed to do, reasonably connected to their legal obligation. They might not do it the way you would do it, and they might violate the rights of people. But more or less, they’re doing what the law says to do. Now, this is very different. I mean, you mentioned throwing people in cars. They’re ripping people out of cars too. They’re smashing their windows. They’re throwing smoke bombs and chemical irritants under the car. There was an infant who stopped breathing and needed CPR by the parents. They’ve been at high schools—saturating high schools, terrorizing kids. There’s been a wide range of crazy behavior.

A federal judge just issued an injunction barring ICE agents from retaliating against protesters in Minnesota. I wonder if you think the federal agents will be abiding by that order, and what that order includes.

Well, let me tell you this: It is a good thing that Judge Kate Menendez issued that very thoughtful order. Before we race ahead and say, “Oh my God, this order could have a problem,” let’s just say that the judge considered the evidence and found that the agency was violating people’s rights and she needed to issue an order to protect them.

What have you learned from seeing how the Trump administration and immigration enforcement have operated in other cities before they came to your region? Are there lessons you took from that? Or do you feel that there are critical differences in how the agents are behaving now that they’re in Minneapolis?

There’s both. The caper they pulled in Chicago, where they descended upon the apartment building, where they’re kicking in doors indiscriminately, that was sort of an indication that we’re dealing with people who have absolutely no sense of legality, propriety, or decency. They will harm anyone they want. People analogize it to the Gestapo. And those analogies are very appropriate. We saw that behavior. Me and my fellow attorneys general talk about this stuff all the time. We’ve been in touch. Of course, the Minnesota one is the biggest surge they’ve done, so nobody really could prepare us for what we’ve seen. But talking to the folks from Oregon, they taught us a lot about using humor. You’ll remember the frog suits and stuff like that.

I would say that we’ve learned a lot from our colleagues, but this one has been the biggest and most severe and most aggressive surge. And so, because of that, we are dealing from no playbook here. But we do have a playbook. It’s called the U.S. Constitution, and we’re going to enforce it.

Republicans say they’re going after your state because there’s a big undocumented population (that’s a lie) and that the Somali community has been engaged in fraud, and that fraud has not been taken seriously by the local leaders. What do you say to that?

Well, if Trump wanted to help us deal with fraud, he would have sent us accountants. Instead, he sent us armed paramilitaries wearing masks, kicking in doors, grabbing whoever. Now, how is that rationally related to white-collar-crime reduction? It’s just ridiculous.

Do you think there’s anything leaders in Minnesota could have done to prevent this? Some would say taking the fraud more seriously would have prevented the most aggressive action.

First, we take fraud very seriously. My office has prosecuted over 300 people for Medicaid fraud and convicted them. And some have gone to prison, and they’ve all been held accountable. This is not about fraud. And if Trump was so concerned about fraud, why would he be pardoning fraudsters who have been committing fraud all over the country? He himself has Trump University fraud. He himself has been convicted civilly. He’s had a civil liability for defrauding the assessment of his buildings and in his taxes.

It’s not about fraud. You’re never going to see somebody doing something wicked and evil and bad saying it. It’s never happened in the history of humanity. Even Hitler said, “I was protecting the homeland and my people.” Mussolini had a reason. Franco had a reason. They all have a reason for the wickedness that they do.

If and when the Department of Justice opens an investigation into you, I wonder if you have a game plan.

I got a lawyer. That’s my game plan. Here’s the thing: Your question is a good one, because what wrong was Tish James doing? None. What wrong was James Comey doing? None. It doesn’t matter whether you’ve committed a crime or acted in violation of the law. What matters is if you’ve offended the king.

It doesn’t sound as if you have any problem offending the king.

I would have no problem giving credit where credit is due if any was due. I just haven’t seen any. This is a president who has taken onto himself the power to tax—that’s what a tariff is—which is Congress’ job. He’s taken onto himself the power to spend. He’s taken onto himself the power to adjudicate what the outcome of a particular controversy should be. That’s the judiciary’s job. He is collapsing the functions of the three levels of government into himself. And then the other element of federalism, which is the balance between the state and the central government, he’s trying to convert states into lesser bodies of sovereignty than we are. And so what do we do with that? Stand around and hope for the best? At some point, just trying to be polite isn’t going to work. And there’s no amount of sucking up that’s going to win you favor from this guy.

            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2026/01/21/nadella_ai_sovereignty_wef/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella says datacenter location is &quot;the least important thing&quot; for AI sovereignty.

In a chat with BlackRock CEO Larry Fink at the Davos World Economic Forum, SatNad argued that corporate AI sovereignty hinges on control over models trained on proprietary knowledge, not the physcial infrastructure location.

&quot;If you&#39;re not able to embed the tacit knowledge of the firm in a set of weights in a model that you control, by definition you have no sovereignty. That means you&#39;re leaking enterprise value to some model somewhere.&quot;

He added: &quot;In fact, the datacenter, where it runs, is the least important thing.&quot;

&quot;In the AI era, the topic that&#39;s least talked about, but I feel will be most talked about in this calendar year, will be the sovereignty of a firm,&quot; Nadella continued.

The reframing follows Microsoft&#39;s struggles with traditional data sovereignty. The software and cloud biz&#39;s EU data boundary – intended to assuage European customers&#39; concerns over dependency on a US-owned entity – cannot guarantee protection against US government access demands.

So it is better to advance the conversation to sovereignty in the AI era, where – according to Nadella – datacenter location is the least of an enterprise&#39;s worries. He said encryption would address sovereignty concerns with only the speed of light constraining datacenters placements.

That assumes sovereignty in the AI era is somehow different from digital sovereignty. A paper published yesterday by the World Economic Forum described AI sovereignty as &quot;the ability of economies to shape, deploy, and govern AI ecosystems in accordance with their own values, whilst ensuring strategic and operational control, flexibility, and, ultimately, resilience through a combination of localized investment and trusted international collaboration.&quot;

Nadella, however, moved beyond national needs and onto the sovereignty of a corporation, regardless of where it is sited. &quot;There is comparative advantage in countries. There is comparative advantage in firms,&quot; he said.

&quot;That needs to be preserved, even in the AI era. That&#39;s what&#39;ll give you real sovereignty.&quot;

Elsewhere in his discussion with Fink, Nadella delved into AI market dynamics and tackled the B word. He said a bubble would exist &quot;if all we are talking about are the tech firms,&quot; noting the technology &quot;depends on demand all over the world.&quot;

Weeks ago, the exec claimed it was time for the next stage of AI acceptance following the &quot;initial phase of discovery.&quot; Microsoft has bet big on AI, via multibillion-dollar investments in OpenAI, squeezing generative AI into every part of its portfolio, and spending hundreds of billions on heavy-duty datacenter infrastructure. It has skin in this game. ®

            <h2>MX Linux 25.1 brings back switchable init systems</h2>
            <p><strong>The Register | 2026-01-21</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2026/01/21/mx_25_1_init_diversity/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">MX Linux 25.1 restores the ability to switch init systems – the killer feature of MX Linux of old.

The update follows a very short beta period – 25.1 beta 1 appeared a week earlier. Then again, this is no ordinary bug-fix point release. As the beta announcement said:

We normally do not produce beta images for &quot;point release&quot; updates, but in this case we thought it was prudent because, as of 25.1, dual-init is now once again possible, and we are including both systemd and sysvinit on the same ISO. This both drastically cuts the number of builds we do and also brings back a feature that was uniquely MX.

In other words, 25.1 restores one of the most distinctive and useful features of MX Linux: the ability to choose your init system as the computer boots. The MX Linux 25 release back in November last year made you choose before installation, and the KDE Plasma edition was only available with systemd.

MX Linux 25.1 with the default Xfce, with start menu at bottom left – and sysvinit

This unfortunate change was looking likely for months – we warned it was likely back in August 2025. This had a couple of drawbacks. On one hand, it meant an unavoidable proliferation of MX Linux 25 editions. As we mentioned when looking at the beta in September, it meant no less than seven different editions. On the other hand, it made Lennart Poettering&#39;s controversial systemd init system harder to avoid. For instance, it&#39;s part of both the MX Linux-based AV Linux distros that we looked at in December.

What&#39;s a little unexpected is that rather than an updated or fixed version of the previous systemd-shim tool, this ability has returned due to a new init-switching system called init-diversity. This comes from an alternate spin of one of MX&#39;s progenitor distros, antiX Linux – we looked at version 23 of this when its Debian 12-based release came out. The newer Debian 13-based release is still in its second beta.

The most recent version of this upstream spin, antiX-23.2 – init-diversity – 2025 remaster edition, offers a choice of six different init systems: sysvinit, s6-rc, s6-66, OpenRC, dinit and runit. For now, MX Linux 25.1 offers just two: the classic sysvinit, or the protean shoggoth that is systemd.

The attractively themed GRUB menu offers a choice of init systems on the Advanced menu

Upgrading MX Linux is a little tricky as it is – we upgraded our spare MX Linux 23 partition to 25, and while the OS works perfectly, the handy MX Tools no longer do. With something as critical as an init system, the developers are playing it safe: updating MX Linux 25 to 25.1 will not install the init-diversity tools. If you want to be able to choose your init, the project has a page describing how to enable it – and it includes uninstallation instructions too.

Our thanks to reader Mike R who tipped us off and sent us a link to the MX Linux Forum thread where this change was discussed earlier this month. ®

            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2026/01/21/uk_social_media_ban/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The UK government&#39;s proposed ban on under-16s using social media would amount to building a mass age-verification system for the entire internet, creating &quot;serious risks to privacy, data protection, and freedom of expression,&quot; digital rights advocates have warned.

The government has opened a public consultation on ways to &quot;drive action to improve children&#39;s relationship with mobile phones and social media,&quot; a broad-brush initiative that goes well beyond a simple age limit. Ministers are asking whether to restrict addictive platform features like infinite scroll, raise the digital age of consent, tighten enforcement of school phone bans, and, yes, consider blocking under-16s from major social platforms.

That consultation comes after weeks of increasingly loud calls in Westminster to tackle children&#39;s screen time with something more dramatic than another set of guidance notes. A group of 61 Labour backbench MPs published an open letter supporting a ban similar to the one in Australia on Monday, and Prime Minister Keir Starmer has signaled that, when it comes to online safety, &quot;no option is off the table.&quot;

But that is precisely the angle that alarms the Open Rights Group (ORG). The civil liberties organization has warned that a ban would require platforms to verify age at scale, with all the privacy and security downsides that entails. Age gating at this level, ORG says, would drag millions of adults and older teens into proving their identity to private corporations simply to post, message, or read online, multiplying the data collection risks that already plague Big Tech.

&quot;We already know these systems are risky,&quot; said James Baker, Platform Power and Free Expression programme manager at Open Rights Group. He pointed to last year&#39;s breach of sensitive age-verification data collected by Discord, a cautionary tale of how personal information can be exposed, misused, or repurposed.

Age-assurance technology is still lightly regulated in the UK, despite repeated warnings from rights groups. These systems often rely on identity documents, facial analysis, or inferred profiling that can have long-term consequences for privacy and security once collected, ORG argues. Even strong data protection laws offer little solace when the premise of a system is to gather more personal data, not less.

One of the Lords&#39; amendments to the Children&#39;s Wellbeing and Schools Bill would push the idea further than some ministers might have intended, potentially banning under-16s from social functions in online games, messaging services like WhatsApp, and even collaborative platforms like Wikipedia. &quot;This goes far beyond Australia&#39;s experiment in banning under-16s from social media,&quot; ORG warned.

The government insists that it&#39;s not rushing to block kids from social media outright. Instead, the consultation sweeps up everything from endless scroll and school phone rules to a possible rethink of digital consent, with ministers repeatedly pointing back to the Online Safety Act.

For digital rights campaigners, that misses the point. They argue that the problem isn&#39;t young people existing online, but platforms designed to keep them hooked – and that banning under-16s risks hard-wiring surveillance into everyday internet use. ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Students at an Arizona school have built a full-scale replica of ENIAC, marking 80 years since the dedication of the computer at the University of Pennsylvania.

ENIAC (Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer) was the first general-purpose, programmable electronic computer. Conceived during the Second World War, construction began in 1944 and finished in 1945. Weighing 30 short tons (about 27 metric tons), it was formally accepted by the US Army Ordnance Corps - which had financed it - in 1946.

While other computing devices existed, including Britain&#39;s Colossus, ENIAC&#39;s general-purpose design set it apart from specialized machines like code-breakers.

The original is long gone, dismantled as obsolete and its components distributed to museums and universities. However, students at PS Academy Arizona have put together a 500-square-foot replica consisting of 45 individual units using original archival documents and historical references. The recreation is of ENIAC as it was first commissioned, marking the machine&#39;s 80th anniversary.

Technology instructor Tom Burick calls it &quot;a full-scale, historically accurate structural replica,&quot; though it is not functional. Assembling the almost 18,000 vacuum tubes needed by the real thing would be impractical.

&quot;All electronic components are visually simulated, not electrically active,&quot; he said.

&quot;Vacuum tubes were recreated using paper printed elements that match the size, spacing, and density of the originals... Cabling paths and plugboard interfaces were recreated visually and spatially so students could understand how dense, repetitive, and precise the machine was.&quot;

Burick told The Reg that approximately 80 students labored for six months on the replica, first on design and ensuring it would be accurate at scale, and then on the tedious, repetitive work of creating and assembling the elements.

&quot;That repetition is historically appropriate,&quot; said Burick. &quot;The original ENIAC required the same kind of patient, precise labor, just with soldering irons instead of hot glue.&quot;

Instead of large steel panels full of wiring and electronics, the 1:1 panels are made from layered cardboard and wood, with a smattering of LED lighting. &quot;Every major unit, accumulators, function tables, initiator, master programmer, is present and placed exactly where it was on the original machine,&quot; said Burick.

There are several decent ENIAC simulators out there, but the approach of Burick and the students is more about understanding how the original ENIAC engineers solved problems and grasping the logic and workflow of early computing.

&quot;This project was never intended to recreate a working ENIAC,&quot; said Burick. &quot;It was designed to recreate the experience, scale, and structure of ENIAC – so students and the public can understand what early computing really looked like and what it demanded of the people who built and operated it.&quot; ®

            <div id="article-text">Bork!Bork!Bork! Sometimes technology is made of sterner stuff than we give credit for, such as this ATM, which has clung on to life – and power – despite the indignities heaped upon it.

Spotted by Register commenter Toonie, today&#39;s entry in the pantheon of public borks is notable not for its ancient operating system, or state of undress, but for the fact that it is functioning at all despite having clearly lived a very tough life.

Our reader spotted the distressed device in 2025 while strolling through the city of Liverpool, England. It has been vandalized and was long out of use, yet, on closer inspection, the CRT was still glowing and stating the admittedly obvious &quot;SORRY OUT OF SERVICE.&quot; Just below, picked out in yellow, is the text &quot;ON-LINE.&quot;

The text looks a little crooked, but let&#39;s face it: someone has had a go at the poor machine with extreme prejudice, and the fitment of the bezel can hardly be called square. So we can forgive the askew letters this time.

The &quot;ON-LINE&quot; text must mean that somewhere a management console is reporting that the ATM is still connected to the network, even though it is unlikely to fulfill its design purpose without substantial reconditioning.

Our reader checked a popular street view service and found that the ATM had been out of service at least as far back as March 2023, although it looked in better condition then.

They also pondered: &quot;Who is paying the electricity bill for this?&quot; The ATM itself is in the wall of an abandoned retail unit, its screen still glowing like part of some dystopian video game or depressingly likely science-fiction flick.

Still, in an age where a computer or phone might suddenly stop working if looked at a bit funny or left outside on a typically drizzly day in the UK, it&#39;s reassuring to note that some technology is made of sterner stuff, with a newfound purpose of simply staying alive rather than merely dispensing cash to Liverpool&#39;s multitudes. ®

            <div id="article-text">The maintainer of popular open-source data transfer tool cURL has ended the project’s bug bounty program after maintainers struggled to assess a flood of AI-generated contributions.

Curler-in-chief Daniel Stenberg last week lodged a GitHub commit named “BUG-BOUNTY.md: we stop the bug-bounty end of Jan 2026”.

Readers may recall that Stenberg started complaining about AI-generated bug reports in early 2024, and by mid-2025 contemplated killing the project’s bug bounty program. After receiving some strong bug reports that a developer found with help from AI, Stenberg acknowledged that AI can be a fine bug-hunting aid.

Stenberg addressed his decision in a mailing message that opened with news that last week the project’s bug bounty scheme generated seven submissions and that while some identified bugs, none described a vulnerability.

He then expressed his hope that ending the bug bounty program will “remove the incentive for people to submit crap and non-well researched reports to us. AI generated or not.”

“The current torrent of submissions put a high load on the curl security team and this is an attempt to reduce the noise.”

Stenberg’s post also expresses his hope that developers continue to send reports of “actual security vulnerabilities … even if we do not pay for them.”

“The future will tell,” he added, and perhaps reveal not just whether developers will share bug reports, but also if they are willing to risk public criticism if their submissions don’t meet Stenberg’s standards.

Stenberg explained his stance in a section of the post that considers his policy of publicly shaming those who submit “silly AI-generated submissions” to the bounty program.

In that section, he reveals a recent discussion with one of the people he criticized.

“It was useful for me to make me remember that oftentimes these people are just ordinary misled humans and they might actually learn from this and perhaps even change,” he wrote.

But Stenberg reserved the right to rage in public.

“This is a balance of course, but I also continue to believe that exposing, discussing and ridiculing the ones who waste our time is one of the better ways to get the message through: you should NEVER report a bug or a vulnerability unless you actually understand it – and can reproduce it.”

“If you still do, I believe I am in the right to make fun of – and be angry at – the person doing it,” he added, before conceding that he also needs to restrain himself on some occasions.

“The person might be a teenage kid who did a single one-time mistake and will then move on in life and make excellent stuff in the future,” he wrote. ®

            <div id="article-text">﻿Zipline’s airborne delivery service is making fans in Texas, with more locales coming soon.

﻿Zipline’s airborne delivery service is making fans in Texas, with more locales coming soon.

On a blustery afternoon late last year, on the lawn just outside City Hall in Rowlett, Texas, a strange-looking craft cleared the trees just before me. It hovered overhead for a moment before lowering a second craft on a thin rope all the way to a parched patch of grass. The little, white thing deposited a brown paper payload, then rode its tether back up to its waiting mothership, which turned and left. The experience lasted less than 30 seconds.

This wasn’t some UFO experience. This was a Zipline drone delivery, out in the real world, and that payload was my lunch. It was just one of the two million such deliveries this company has made since 2016, carrying everything from household supplies in rural America to lifesaving vaccines in remote Africa. And soon, those drone deliveries will be coming to even more places.

Zipline is a California-based company that has only been slinging burritos and other items in the Lone Star State since 2025, but has been proving itself elsewhere in the world for nearly a decade now.

The company first started operations in Rwanda in 2016, delivering medical supplies in minutes to remote locations. Independent studies have shown the lifesaving nature of Zipline’s deliveries, making this the rare startup with a genuine feel-good story at its core.

In Africa, Zipline operates what it calls Platform 1, or P1, aircraft, fixed-wing, uncrewed machines that look like bigger versions of the toys your grandpa built out of balsa in the basement. Workers load four-pound payloads into the belly of these planes, then launch them into the sky via giant slingshot.

Once in the air, the P1s plot their own courses, up to 120 miles round-trip, reading weather data along the route and finding their own way around storms. They then deploy the payload via parachute before returning home for a cargo reload and a battery swap.

The delivery machines used in the US are rather more sophisticated but are likewise autonomous. Called P2, they rely on five motors and can transition midair from hovering to traditional, horizontal flight. This means they can launch and land vertically, or hover over a drop zone. What they give up in efficiency from the P1 (max range here is 24 miles) they gain in flexibility, making them better suited for the sorts of suburban areas Zipline is currently targeting.

The hallmark of the P2 is its tethered buddy, called a Zip. Each Zip has a single motor of its own plus room for an eight-pound payload roughly the size of a breadbox. Its propeller is there in case it needs to fight the wind as it’s lowered from the P2 aircraft hovering above.

The P2 is loaded with redundant sensors, even able to monitor nearby aircraft transponders. The bevy of sensors and smarts onboard means it’s an uncrewed aircraft capable of flying safely even in busy, urban airspace beyond the line of sight, or BVLOS in FAA-speak.

The capabilities of Zipline’s aircraft is proven through a strong safety record with over 125 million miles flown. That’s reassuring, but I was curious how Texans have been responding to this whole thing. After all, this is a state full of people you wouldn’t think would appreciate automated, sensor-laden aircraft hovering over their homes.

“Generally speaking, compared to some things that we picture in our community, there was not as much opposition as you might expect,” Rowlett Mayor Jeff Winget told me. “I think most people were really pretty excited about it.”

Winget told me the approval and permitting process took about five months, helped by Zipline working to keep its footprint minimal.

After receiving my lunch, I swung by one of Zipline’s so-called Zipping Points, where bundles are loaded for delivery. This one happened to be in a Wendy’s parking lot, but they can be quickly and easily deployed wherever pickups are needed.

The Zipping Points are curious contraptions, odd white kiosks with a pair of metal arms reaching for the sky. In theory, these enable retail workers to load in a delivery and walk away. The P2 then hovers overhead, drops its little Zip buddy to retrieve the payload, and then wings off to its hungry recipient.

I say “in theory” because, when I was watching, some deliveries needed a bit of manual help from a small team of Zipline employees dashing between retailers to ensure pickups went smoothly. Some pickups needed a few attempts, but all were on their way quickly enough.

And, crucially, even on a blustery day when drones are typically at their loudest as they fight the wind, the traffic overhead made less noise than the nearby intersection. The P2 hovers high enough overhead while receiving or delivering parcels that it’s honestly hard to hear, far less noticeable than your average consumer drone.

While Mayor Winget said the feedback he receives from constituents is incredibly positive, the relatively low noise pollution should help keep everything copacetic as the service continues to expand. Still, there have been some less positive reactions to the rollout.

John Erik Ege, the state director of the Texas branch of the Mutual UFO Network (MUFON), said there have been a few reports from concerned citizens since Zipline began operating in Texas. One, filed in September, described a strange hovering object that lowered something that traveled straight down, then “re-docked” before disappearing.

He also told me of someone else who reported a similar “mother ship” deploying a smaller object straight down. “She was frustrated that folks at work and friends ridiculed her. This is unfortunate. She did actually witness something,” Ege said.

That something, of course, was a delivery drone. This is hardly a repeat of last year’s New Jersey drone scare, but MUFON representatives in Houston and Phoenix would do well to prepare. Those two cities will be next to receive Zipline service over the next few months.

And how was my lunch? I must confess, it was fresher and hotter than any burrito delivery I’ve ever received, a noticeable step above what I’m used to from myriad terrestrial food delivery services. Ordering through the Zipline app was no more complicated than Uber Eats. My burrito had a delivery fee of $0.99, plus a 20-percent service fee (that’s capped at $6). And no, you don’t need to tip the drone. If you’re not feeling Chipotle, you can currently place orders through Blaze Pizza, Buffalo Wild Wings, Crumbl, Little Caesars, Walmart, and Wendy’s.

In the retail drone delivery space, Zipline’s primary competitor is Alphabet’s Wing, which also works with Walmart. While Wing has managed an impressive 750,000 deliveries, that’s fewer than half of Zipline’s tally. Amazon Prime Air, meanwhile, recently suspended its testing after a pair of crashes. For the moment, nobody looks set to challenge Zipline’s early lead, especially as it expands into Houston and Phoenix. That lead just netted the company a $7.6 billion valuation in its most recent $600 million raise.

Yes, this is yet another attack by robots on human jobs, but honestly it’s one I can get behind. In a town like Rowlett, if you get food delivered, it’s going to come to you by car, and the idea of a human being driving a 4,000-pound vehicle to carry a burrito in a paper bag is just a bit excessive.

            <h2>What a Sony and TCL partnership means for the future of TVs</h2>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">It’s still over a year off, and might not even happen, but a Sony and TCL partnership has wide-spanning implications.

It’s still over a year off, and might not even happen, but a Sony and TCL partnership has wide-spanning implications.

I’m not sure anyone saw this news coming, but the TV landscape as we know it could change considerably over the next year or two. Sony, the storied Japanese TV brand, has announced that it has signed a memorandum of understanding with its Chinese competitor TCL. This potential partnership — with TCL set to hold a 51 percent stake and Sony 49 percent — has prompted speculation across the internet and I’m sure many meetings at a couple of other TV companies in South Korea.

Before we get too apocalyptic and proclaim the end of Sony TVs, it’s important to understand that this isn’t a done deal. The memorandum of understanding indicates that the two companies are in discussions to potentially establish a partnership. There’s still a couple of months before any binding agreements will be drawn up, and then there will need to be regulatory approvals made of those agreements. So there’s still a chance everything could fall apart and nothing comes of yesterday’s announcement. Even if we do hear of a binding contract by the end of March, the new company won’t be fully in effect until April of next year, meaning we likely won’t see any physical products until late in 2027.

As of today, Sony already relies on different manufacturing partners to create its TV lineup. While display panel manufacturers never reveal who they sell panels to, Sony is likely already using panels for its LCD TVs from TCL China Star Optoelectronics Technology (CSOT), in addition to OLED panels from LG Display and Samsung Display. With this deal, a relationship between Sony and TCL CSOT LCD panels is guaranteed (although I doubt this would affect CSOT selling panels to other manufacturers). And with TCL CSOT building a new OLED facility, there’s a potential future in which Sony OLEDs will also get panels from TCL. Although I should point out that we’re not sure yet if the new facility will have the ability to make TV-sized OLED panels, at least to start.

So what does Sony get out of this deal? For one, it gets access to the production capabilities of TCL. The Chinese company has long promoted the fact that it controls the whole chain of its TV manufacturing process, allowing it to more easily dictate technological development and pricing. If we consider the X11L, it has two important improvements to blue mini-LED tech: newly reformulated quantum dots and an improved color filter. Other companies that use quantum dots could purchase the new QDs and implement them.

But without a new color filter, a TV can’t fully take advantage of the new quantum dots. And since color filters are incorporated into the mother glass during manufacturing, changing a color filter involves stopping panel production to update machinery. It’s a big investment for another panel manufacturer to do that for one of its TV manufacturing customers. That’s where TCL has an advantage with its control over the end-to-end production of TVs. The other huge benefit to controlling production at that level is being able to keep overall costs down. With this potential partnership, Sony gains access to that manufacturing infrastructure.

For TCL, it gets majority control over the production of Sony TVs, but also access to the technology within those TVs. What makes a Sony TV a Sony TV isn’t the way that it’s put together, but its SoC (System on a Chip) and picture processing capabilities. Sony has long been the leader in picture processing, setting its TV performance apart from competitors — the Bravia 8 II is special because of the processing and not because of the QD-OLED panel from (presumably) Samsung Display.

Ultimately for those of us considering the purchase of a Sony TV, the combination of TCL’s manufacturing pipeline and Sony’s excellent picture processing could lead to even better Sony Bravia TVs at more accessible prices.

It would take a lot for Sony to completely step aside and allow another company to slap its name on an inferior product

There’s some concern from fans that this could lead to a Sharp, Toshiba, or Pioneer situation where the names are licensed and the TVs produced are a shell of what the brands used to represent. I don’t see this happening with Sony. While the electronics side of the business hasn’t been as strong as in the past, Sony — and Bravia — is still a storied brand. It would take a lot for Sony to completely step aside and allow another company to slap its name on an inferior product. And based on TCL’s growth and technological improvements over the past few years, and the shrinking gap between premium and midrange TVs, I don’t expect Sony TVs will suffer from a partnership with TCL.

A few key things are still up in the air based on the announcement. How much of Sony’s processing prowess is going to flow into TCL TVs? The release from Sony mentions the new company will combine Sony’s picture and audio technology with TCL’s manufacturing while retaining the Sony and Bravia name, but there’s no mention if TCL gains access to the Sony tech for its own TCL-branded TVs. Could Sony continue to offer premium TVs while TCL focuses on midrange and entry? It’s possible, but I think it’s more likely that we’ll see some midrange overlap between the brands and that there will still be a distinct design difference between a Sony TV and a TCL TV.

The release had a brief mention about Sony’s audio technology and home audio equipment. It sounds like this new Sony/TCL entity will take over Sony products including soundbars, speakers, and maybe even AVRs and turntables. (I don’t think headphones will be included, as Sony previously separated them into a Personal Audio division.) Both companies have been behind competitors — particularly Samsung and its Harman properties — so joining forces could give them the lift they need.

No matter the rampant speculation, it’s clear we’re a couple years away from seeing the products that come out of this partnership (assuming it officially happens in a few months). Both Sony and TCL will continue to release the TVs and audio products they have both been developing in 2026 and into 2027. In my opinion, this potential deal demonstrates the home entertainment powerhouse that TCL has become.

But, more importantly, I don’t believe this signals the end of Sony. Instead, it might be the beginning of a new phase that could return it to relevance for the majority of TV buyers — and not just the premium enthusiasts that populate videophile forums.

‘We’re being good neighbors,’ the ChatGPT maker said.

OpenAI says it will minimize water use and pay for energy infrastructure upgrades needed to power its data centers. “We’re being good neighbors,” the company said, directly addressing the growing opposition to AI projects amid rising utility bills.

“We commit to paying our own way on energy, so that our operations don’t increase your electricity prices,” OpenAI said. The company promised to work with local communities to minimize the impact of its Stargate data centers. OpenAI was not specific but said plans could involve securing its own energy supplies or paying for local grid upgrades.

OpenAI also highlighted the vast amounts of water — often potable — used to cool data centers, a concern that drives opposition to projects. Impact could be minimized by “innovations in cooling water systems” and AI design, the company said.

OpenAI’s announcement comes on the heels of a similar community pledge from Microsoft designed to address mounting frustration on the ground in communities around data centers. The pushback is becoming a growing issue for tech companies striving to build out AI infrastructure, even leading to scrubbed projects in some cases.

New safeguards for underage users aim to reduce exposure to sensitive content.

OpenAI has added age prediction features to ChatGPT, meant to identify and bolster protections for underage users. These age detection plans were announced in December alongside updated guidelines for interacting with teens and follow a rise in similar age-gating efforts from online platforms, including Instagram, YouTube, TikTok, and Roblox.

ChatGPT’s age prediction model works by examining behavioral and account-level signals, including a user’s stated age, how old the account is, when the user is active, and usage patterns over time. Additional protections will then be applied to persons that ChatGPT estimates are under the age of 18, restricting exposure to sensitive content, such as:

Adult users who are incorrectly placed in the under-18 experience can restore their unrestricted access by verifying their age with a selfie. Age prediction is rolling out globally, except in the EU, where OpenAI says it will “roll out in the coming weeks to account for regional requirements.”

These age prediction features and additional safeguards come after ChatGPT was the focus of a teen suicide lawsuit and a Senate panel discussing chatbots’ potential harm to minors.

﻿The tech CEOs were supposed to be Trump’s “supplicants”. Now, they’ve broken the populists’ chokehold on him.

Welcome to Regulator, a newsletter for Verge subscribers about the technology and the tech bros upending American politics and the Trump administration. If you’re not a subscriber yet, and you’re interested in Silicon Valley’s adventures in sausage-making, you should do so here! It’s Q1! Surely the corporate budget will allow for it.

Precisely one year ago, Steve Bannon, the powerful, populist MAGA podcaster, was thrilled at the sight of the Big Tech CEOs swarming around Donald Trump. In the days before his inauguration, the major players were visiting Mar-a-Lago, signing checks, even showing up to sit quietly behind him during his second inauguration. For years, Bannon told ABC’s Jonathan Karl in an interview, Big Tech had undermined Trump: Jeff Bezos’ Washington Post had reported on him critically, for instance, while Meta and Alphabet’s subsidiaries had purportedly silenced his online presence. Now, Bannon said, they were “supplicants” to Trump, who’d hired MAGA regulators ready to tear apart those companies at any given moment. “Most people in our movement look at this as President Trump broke the oligarchs,” he bragged.

One year later, it looks like the oligarchs have broken MAGA’s hold on Trump, one ballroom donation at a time.

The push to break up Big Tech, which seemed to be one of MAGA’s biggest goals at the beginning of the term? Kind of not really happening anymore. The push to get an American company to purchase TikTok, the app that MAGA had once considered cultural poison? Supposedly happening, but not without Trump embracing the platform in defiance of MAGA values. The push to prevent AI companies from stomping over states’ rights, conservative values, and AI-driven job loss? Overrun by the relentless lobbying by billionaire David Sacks, who convinced Trump to sign an executive order that would crush states trying to write or enforce their own AI laws, despite severe backlash from conservatives.

Even smaller pivots from firm MAGA positions in favor of the tech industry, and the response from said base, are telling. Last November, Trump sparked outrage from the right by defending the existence of H1-B visas for high-skilled foreign tech workers, going so far as to say that US workers lacked “certain talents” that prevented Big Tech from hiring domestically. Although Trump ended up radically overhauling the immigration lottery system in a more nativist favor, the continued existence of the H1-B visa program itself sparked a massive rift within the MAGAsphere: how could Trump let in any foreign workers, much less imply that they were better than American workers? What sort of “America First” was that?

For decades, even as a businessman, Trump’s had one consistent organizational principle: people and factions must constantly fight each other for his attention and favor. It happened all the time during Trump’s first term, when New York financiers, the Republican establishment, the career officials, Trump’s children, and the proto-MAGA wing were all fighting each other inside the West Wing. But by the time Trump returned to the campaign trail in 2024, the New Yorkers were exhausted and went home, the Republican establishment had caved to Trump, and the career officials were all about to be purged. MAGA populism had won, and they believed, to paraphrase Trump, that they would win so much that they would become tired of winning. It’s not like the populists haven’t claimed territory in Trump’s second administration. The Department of Justice is conducting lawfare against Trump’s critics, the Department of Homeland Security has given ICE a broadly terrifying mandate, and the Department of Defense (sorry, War) kidnapped a foreign head of state for the LOLs.

But honestly, I would not have expected a year ago, as I watched the tech CEOs applaud Trump in the Rotunda, that these “supplicants” would eventually sway Trump to their ways. I’m not sure how the next year looks for internal drama coming out of the White House. I will say, however, that it is very, very telling that Bannon, who once bragged that there was a plan in place for Trump to run for an unconstitutional third term, is reportedly eyeing a presidential run himself.

Well, in the sense of the Senate being on a one-week recess, during which I will be following the drama of Coinbase derailing the CLARITY Act over interest rates, before the Senate Banking Committee reconvenes. To my great regret, I am not at Davos, where CEO Brian Armstrong is and where most of the negotiations seem to be happening. So if you are in some private Swiss meeting with other tech overlords and have some insight into whether there will be an actual market structure bill passed in the upcoming year, please email me at tina@theverge.com, or over Signal at tina_nguyen.19.

In the meantime, please do not get duped like the billionaires in this Bloomberg report:

With four different models to pick between, here’s how to land on the right AirPods for you.

If you buy something from a Verge link, Vox Media may earn a commission. See our ethics statement.

Whether you’re buying your first pair of AirPods or replacing a well-used older pair, it’s easy to understand why so many iPhone owners prefer Apple’s earbuds and headphones over other options. Apple has spent years gradually adding new features that work best — and sometimes only work at all — with the company’s own devices. These convenient tricks include audio sharing, automatic switching between Apple’s various devices, live translation, Apple TV integration, and more.

There are currently four AirPods models to choose from, each with its own distinct appeal and upside. You likely already know whether you’re more interested in earbuds or over-ear headphones, so that’s the first divide. In the case of over-ear headphones, your only choice is the AirPods Max. But in the earbuds category, Apple offers three options: the AirPods Pro 3, the AirPods 4 with Active Noise Cancellation, and the plain old AirPods 4.

We spend dozens of hours using AirPods products for our initial reviews, and that testing extends for weeks and months afterward. That’s where we assess sound quality, mic performance, and overall reliability. Where applicable, we test the active noise cancellation across a wide range of environments and have put the hearing protection of the AirPods Pro through the paces at concerts. We also closely examine ecosystem benefits and how the AirPods and Apple’s other products work together.

Improved ANC and soundLonger batteryStandalone workout trackingLive translationSame priceIP57Better fitCamera remote control is handy!

If you’re hoping for traditional foam ear tips, this isn’t that

Noise cancellation: Yes / Battery life: 8 hours (ANC on) / Water resistance: IP57 / Bluetooth codecs: AAC, SBC / Multipoint: No / Works best with: iOS, Windows, macOS / Ear tips: Foam and silicone (XXS, XS, S, M, L)

The third-gen AirPods Pro are better than their predecessor in numerous ways, starting with the fit. Apple’s latest flagship earbuds feature a more angular design and a wider range of ear tip sizes — including an XXS option. Their “foam-infused” tips combine foam and silicone, so they expand slightly for better comfort and a tighter seal. If you’ve ever cursed at AirPods for falling out of your ears, the Pro 3’s improved fit alone might sell you.

They also deliver upgrades to noise cancellation, which allow them to rival even the AirPods Max. They’re noticeably better at dampening high-frequency sounds, like voices, than prior generations of AirPods Pro, and they can eliminate the low hum of an airplane engine. Sound quality has also been improved in ways that were surprisingly easy to pick out: bass is punchier, vocals are clearer, and you’ll notice new layers in your favorite tracks. Meanwhile, battery life will last you a full work day with ANC enabled before the buds need to go back into the charging case for a refill.

In addition to giving users the flexibility to use these earbuds as clinical-grade hearing aids — a feature Apple introduced in late 2024 — Apple has added a heart rate sensor to this model, allowing you to track workouts right from your ears. Add in IP57 water and dust resistance, stronger Find My capabilities, and a live translation feature, and it’s clear the AirPods Pro are Apple’s best wireless earbuds by a wide margin.

Not everyone likes the way ear tips feel. Even with venting and the other measures Apple has taken to improve comfort and reduce that clogged-up sensation in the AirPods Pro 3, some people just prefer the regular, one-size-fits-most AirPods. Their open design means you’re never totally cut off from the outside world. The AirPods Pro have an impressive transparency mode, but the AirPods 4 don’t need it.

Apple currently sells two versions of the AirPods 4. No matter which you choose, you’ll get the same good sound quality, microphone performance on voice calls, and IP54 water resistance. The more expensive pair has features that you might want, including active noise cancellation and a more advanced charging case (it supports Find My and wireless charging). You might be surprised by how well the noise cancellation works even with an unsealed design; it reduces office ambience and annoying hums, but louder sounds and voices still cut through the ANC, since these don’t use a sealed ear tip.

If you’re truly interested in noise-canceling earbuds, consider upgrading to the AirPods Pro 3. They offer much better audio quality, stronger ANC, and a better experience overall. I’d only steer you to the noise-canceling AirPods 4 if you’re really opposed to ear tips.

Noise cancellation: Yes / Battery life: 20 hours (ANC on) / Water resistance: No / Bluetooth codecs: AAC, SBC / Multipoint: No / Works best with: iOS, Windows, macOS

We’ve gone back and forth recommending Apple’s $549 AirPods Max over the last few years. They have a standout design, but the good looks and premium feel come at a high cost. Not just that, these headphones are considerably heavier than most competitors and can get fatiguing over extended use. But the fabric ear cups on the AirPods Max are much more pleasant in warm weather than the pleather you’ll find on Bose and Sony products, and probably won’t leave you with sweaty ears.

The AirPods Max provide impressive noise cancellation, and the transparency mode is clearer and more natural-sounding than any other set of headphones on the market. As for sound, Apple’s headphones have a pleasant sound signature that works well across a wide range of genres. They’re easy to listen to with an impressive soundstage for closed-back headphones.

You lose some features found in the AirPods Pro 3 and AirPods 4 with ANC — including conversation awareness and adaptive audio — because the AirPods Max use Apple’s older H1 chip. However, the company added lossless audio over USB-C in April, meaning these headphones offer the richest audio fidelity in Apple’s entire lineup.

With Apple’s fall hardware event in the rearview mirror, we’re at a point where the company’s lineup seems settled (for now). Apple doesn’t upgrade its entry-level AirPods line on an annual basis like some of its other products, and the Pro 3 just recently hit the market. Meanwhile, the AirPods Max have gone relatively unchanged since their release in 2020, with Apple adding a USB-C model and a new color in 2024. It’s possible that we’ll see a camera-equipped pair of AirPods with support for Apple Intelligence in the future — previous reporting has indicated as much — but it’s not likely to be anytime soon.

            <div id="article-text">This story first appeared in The Debrief, our subscriber-only newsletter about the biggest news in tech by Mat Honan, Editor in Chief. Subscribe to read the next edition as soon as it lands.

Hello from the World Economic Forum annual meeting in Davos, Switzerland. I’ve been here for two days now, attending meetings, speaking on panels, and basically trying to talk to anyone I can. And as far as I can tell, the only things anyone wants to talk about are AI, and Trump.

Davos is physically defined by the Congress Center, where the official WEF sessions take place, and the Promenade, a street running through the center of the town lined with various “houses”—mostly retailers that are temporarily converted into meeting hubs for various corporate or national sponsors. So there is a Ukraine House, a Brazil House, Saudi House, and yes, a USA House (more on that tomorrow). There are a handful of media houses from the likes of CNBC and The Wall Street Journal. Some houses are devoted to specific topics, for example there’s one for science and another for AI.

But like everything else in 2026, the Promenade is dominated by tech companies. At one point I realized that literally everything I could see, in a spot where the road bends a bit, was a tech company house. Palantir, Workday, Infosys, Cloudflare, C3.ai. Maybe this should go without saying, but their presence, both in the houses and on the various stages and parties and platforms here at the World Economic Forum, really drove home to me how utterly and completely tech has captured the global economy.

While the houses host events and serve as networking hubs, the big show is inside the Congress Center. On Tuesday morning, I kicked off my official Davos experience there by moderating a panel with the CEOs of Accenture, Aramco, Royal Philips and Visa. The topic was scaling up AI within organizations. All of these leaders represented companies that have gone from pilot projects to large internal implementations. It was, for me, a fascinating conversation. You can watch the whole thing here, but my takeaway was that while there are plenty of stories about AI being overhyped (including from us), it is certainly having substantive effects at large companies.

Aramco CEO Amin Nasser, for example, described how that company has found $3-5 billion in cost savings by improving the efficiency of its operations. Royal Philips CEO Roy Jakobs described how it was allowing healthcare practitioners to spend more time with patients by doing things such as automated note-taking. (This really resonated with me as my wife is a pediatrics nurse, and for decades now I’ve heard her talk about how much of her time is devoted to charting.) And Visa CEO Ryan McInerney talked about that company’s push into agentic commerce and the way that will play out for consumers, small businesses, and the global payments industry.

To elaborate a little on that point, McInerney painted a picture of commerce where agents won’t just shop for things you ask them to, which will be basically step one, but will eventually be able to shop for things based on your preferences and previous spending patterns. This could be your regular grocery shopping, or even a vacation getaway. That’s going to require a lot of trust and authentication to protect both merchants and consumers, but it is clear that the steps into agentic commerce we saw in 2025 were just baby ones. There are much bigger ones coming for 2026. (Coincidentally, I had a discussion with a senior executive from Mastercard on Monday, who made several of the same points.)

But the thing that really resonated with me from the panel was something Accenture CEO Julie Sweet—who has a view not only of her own large org but across a spectrum of companies—said: “It’s hard to trust something until you understand it.”

I felt like that neatly summed up where we are as a society with AI.

Clearly other people feel the same. Before the official start of the conference I was at AI House for a panel. The place was packed. There was a consistent, massive line to get in, and once inside I literally had to muscle my way through the crowd. Everyone wanted to get in. Everyone wanted to talk about AI.

(A quick aside on what I was doing there: I sat on a panel on “Creativity and Identity in the Age of Memes and Deepfakes” led by Atlantic CEO Nicholas Thompson, featuring the artist Emi Kusano who works with AI, and Duncan Crabtree-Ireland, the chief negotiator for SAG-AFTRA, who has been at the center over a lot of the debates about AI in the film and gaming industries. I’m not going to spend much time describing it because I’m already running long, but it was a rip-roarer of a panel. Check it out.)

The President is due here Wednesday, amid threats of seizing Greenland and fears that he’s about to permanently fracture the NATO alliance. While AI is all over the stages, Trump is dominating all the side conversations. There are lots of little jokes. Nervous laughter. Outright anger. Fear in the eyes. It’s wild.

These conversations are also starting to spill out into the public conversations. Just after my panel on Tuesday, I headed to a pavilion outside the main hall in the Congress Center. I saw someone coming down the stairs with a small entourage, who was suddenly mobbed by cameras and phones.

Moments earlier in the same spot, the press had been surrounding David Beckham, shouting questions at him. So I was primed for it to be another celebrity – after all captains of industry were everywhere you looked. I mean, I had just bumped into Eric Schmidt, who was literally standing in line in front of me at the coffee bar. Davos is weird.

But in fact, it was Gavin Newsom, the governor of California who is increasingly seen as the leading voice of the Democratic opposition to President Trump, and a likely contender, or even frontrunner, in the race to replace him. Because I live in San Francisco I’ve encountered Newsom many times, dating back to his early days as a city supervisor before he was even mayor. I’ve rarely, rarely, seen him quite so worked up as he was on Tuesday.

Among other things, he called Trump a narcissist who follows “the law of the jungle, the rule of Don” and compared him to a T-Rex, saying “you mate with him or he devours you.” And he was just as harsh on the world leaders, many of whom are gathered in Davos, calling them “pathetic” and saying he should have brought knee pads for them.

There was more of this sentiment, if in more measured tones, from Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney during his address at Davos. While I missed his remarks, they had people talking. “If we&#39;re not at the table, we&#39;re on the menu,” he argued.

Here are our picks for the advances to watch in the years ahead—and why we think they matter right now.

            <h2>Reimagining ERP for the agentic AI era</h2>
            <p><strong>MIT Technology Review | 2026-01-20</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2026/01/20/1129965/reimagining-erp-for-the-agentic-ai-era/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The story of enterprise resource planning (ERP) is really a story of businesses learning to organize themselves around the latest, greatest technology of the times. In the 1960s through the ’80s, mainframes, material requirements planning (MRP), and manufacturing resource planning (MRP II) brought core business data from file cabinets to centralized systems. Client-server architectures defined the ’80s and ’90s, taking digitization mainstream during the internet’s infancy. And in the 21st century, as work moved beyond the desktop, SaaS and cloud ushered in flexible access and elastic infrastructure.

The rise of composability and agentic AI marks yet another dawn—and an apt one for the nascent intelligence age. Composable architectures let organizations assemble capabilities from multiple systems in a mix-and-match fashion, so they can swap vendor gridlock for an à la carte portfolio of fit-for-purpose modules. On top of that architectural shift, agentic AI enables coordination across systems that weren’t originally designed to talk to one another.

Early indicators suggest that AI-enabled ERP will yield meaningful performance gains: One 2024 study found that organizations implementing AI-driven ERP solutions stand to gain around a 30% boost in user satisfaction and a 25% lift in productivity; another suggested that AI-driven ERP can lead to processing time savings of up to 45%, as well as improvements in decision accuracy to the tune of 60%.

These dual advancements address long-standing gaps that previous ERP eras fell short of delivering: freedom to innovate outside of vendor roadmaps, capacity for rapid iteration, and true interoperability across all critical functions. This shift signals the end of monolithic dependency as well as a once-in-a-generation opportunity for early movers to gain a competitive edge.

            <div id="article-text">AI agents are moving beyond coding assistants and customer service chatbots into the operational core of the enterprise. The ROI is promising, but autonomy without alignment is a recipe for chaos. Business leaders need to lay the essential foundations now.

Agents are independently handling end-to-end processes across lead generation, supply chain optimization, customer support, and financial reconciliation. A mid-sized organization could easily run 4,000 agents, each making decisions that affect revenue, compliance, and customer experience.

The transformation toward an agent-driven enterprise is inevitable. The economic benefits are too significant to ignore, and the potential is becoming a reality faster than most predicted. The problem? Most businesses and their underlying infrastructure are not prepared for this shift. Early adopters have found unlocking AI initiatives at scale to be extremely challenging.

Companies are investing heavily in AI, but the returns aren&#39;t materializing. According to recent research from Boston Consulting Group, 60% of companies report minimal revenue and cost gains despite substantial investment. However, the leaders reported they achieved five times the revenue increases and three times the cost reductions. Clearly, there is a massive premium for being a leader.

What separates the leaders from the pack isn&#39;t how much they&#39;re spending or which models they&#39;re using. Before scaling AI deployment, these “future-built” companies put critical data infrastructure capabilities in place. They invested in the foundational work that enables AI to function reliably.

To understand how and where enterprise AI can fail, consider four critical quadrants: models, tools, context, and governance.

Take a simple example: an agent that orders you pizza. The model interprets your request (&quot;get me a pizza&quot;). The tool executes the action (calling the Domino&#39;s or Pizza Hut API). Context provides personalization (you tend to order pepperoni on Friday nights at 7pm). Governance validates the outcome (did the pizza actually arrive?).

Each dimension represents a potential failure point:

This framework helps diagnose where reliability gaps emerge. When an enterprise agent fails, which quadrant is the problem? Is the model misunderstanding intent? Are the tools unavailable or broken? Is the context incomplete or contradictory? Or is there no mechanism to verify that the agent did what it was supposed to do?

The temptation is to think that reliability will simply improve as models improve. Yet, model capability is advancing exponentially. The cost of inference has dropped nearly 900 times in three years, hallucination rates are on the decline, and AI’s capacity to perform long tasks doubles every six months.

Tooling is also accelerating. Integration frameworks like the Model Context Protocol (MCP) make it dramatically easier to connect agents with enterprise systems and APIs.

If models are powerful and tools are maturing, then what is holding back adoption?

To borrow from James Carville, “It is the data, stupid.” The root cause of most misbehaving agents is misaligned, inconsistent, or incomplete data.

Enterprises have accumulated data debt over decades. Acquisitions, custom systems, departmental tools, and shadow IT have left data scattered across silos that rarely agree. Support systems do not match what is in marketing systems. Supplier data is duplicated across finance, procurement, and logistics. Locations have multiple representations depending on the source.

Drop a few agents into this environment, and they will perform wonderfully at first, because each one is given a curated set of systems to call. Add more agents and the cracks grow, as each one builds its own fragment of truth.

This dynamic has played out before. When business intelligence became self-serve, everyone started creating dashboards. Productivity soared, reports failed to match. Now imagine that phenomenon not in static dashboards, but in AI agents that can take action. With agents, data inconsistency produces real business consequences, not just debates among departments.

Companies that build unified context and robust governance can deploy thousands of agents with confidence, knowing they&#39;ll work together coherently and comply with business rules. Companies that skip this foundational work will watch their agents produce contradictory results, violate policies, and ultimately erode trust faster than they create value.

The question for enterprises centers on organizational readiness. Will your company prepare the data foundation needed to make agent transformation work? Or will you spend years debugging agents, one issue at a time, forever chasing problems that originate in infrastructure you never built?

Autonomous agents are already transforming how work gets done. But the enterprise will only experience the upside if those systems operate from the same truth. This ensures that when agents reason, plan, and act, they do so based on accurate, consistent, and up-to-date information.

The companies generating value from AI today have built on fit-for-purpose data foundations. They recognized early that in an agentic world, data functions as essential infrastructure. A solid data foundation is what turns experimentation into dependable operations.

At Reltio, the focus is on building that foundation. The Reltio data management platform unifies core data from across the enterprise, giving every agent immediate access to the same business context. This unified approach enables enterprises to move faster, act smarter, and unlock the full value of AI.

Agents will define the future of the enterprise. Context intelligence will determine who leads it.

            <h2>The UK government is backing AI that can run its own lab experiments</h2>
            <p><strong>MIT Technology Review | 2026-01-20</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2026/01/20/1131462/the-uk-government-is-backing-ai-scientists-that-can-run-their-own-experiments/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">A number of startups and university teams that are building “AI scientists” to design and run experiments in the lab, including robot biologists and chemists, have just won extra funding from the UK government agency that supports moonshot R&D. The competition, set up by ARIA (the Advanced Research and Invention Agency), gives a clear sense of how fast this technology is moving: The agency received 245 proposals from researchers who are already developing tools that can automate significant stretches of lab work.

ARIA defines an AI scientist as a system that can run an entire scientific workflow, coming up with hypotheses, designing and running experiments to test those hypotheses, and then analyzing the results. In many cases, the system may then feed those results back into itself and run the loop again and again. Human scientists become overseers, coming up with the initial research questions and then letting the AI scientist get on with the grunt work.

“There are better uses for a PhD student than waiting around in a lab until 3 a.m. to make sure an experiment is run to the end,” says Ant Rowstron, ARIA’s chief technology officer.

ARIA picked 12 projects to fund from the 245 proposals, doubling the amount of funding it had intended to allocate because of the large number and high quality of submissions. Half the teams are from the UK; the rest are from the US and Europe. Some of the teams are from universities, some from industry. Each will get around £500,000 (around $675,000) to cover nine months’ work. At the end of that time, they should be able to demonstrate that their AI scientist was able to come up with novel findings.

Winning teams include Lila Sciences, a US company that is building what it calls an AI nano-scientist—a system that will design and run experiments to discover the best ways to compose and process quantum dots, which are nanometer-scale semiconductor particles used in medical imaging, solar panels, and QLED TVs.

“We are using the funds and time to prove a point,” says Rafa Gómez-Bombarelli, chief science officer for physical sciences at Lila: “The grant lets us design a real AI robotics loop around a focused scientific problem, generate evidence that it works, and document the playbook so others can reproduce and extend it.”

Another team, from the University of Liverpool, UK, is building a robot chemist, which runs multiple experiments at once and uses a vision language model to help troubleshoot when the robot makes an error.

And a startup based in London, still in stealth mode, is developing an AI scientist called ThetaWorld, which is using LLMs to design experiments on the physical and chemical interactions that are important for the performance of batteries. Those experiments will then be run in an automated lab.

Compared with the £5 million projects spanning two or three years that ARIA usually funds, £500,000 is small change. But that was the idea, says Rowstron: It’s an experiment on ARIA’s part too. By funding a range of projects for a short amount of time, the agency is taking the temperature at the cutting edge to determine how the way science is done is changing, and how fast. What it learns will become the baseline for funding future large-scale projects.

Rowstron acknowledges there’s a lot of hype, especially now that most of the top AI companies have teams focused on science. When results are shared by press release and not peer review, it can be hard to know what the technology can and can’t do. “That’s always a challenge for a research agency trying to fund the frontier,” he says. “To do things at the frontier, we&#39;ve got to know what the frontier is.”

For now, the cutting edge involves agentic systems calling up other existing tools on the fly. “They’re running things like large language models to do the ideation, and then they use other models to do optimization and run experiments,” says Rowstron. “And then they feed the results back round.”

Rowstron sees the technology stacked in tiers. At the bottom are AI tools designed by humans for humans, such as AlphaFold. These tools let scientists leapfrog slow and painstaking parts of the scientific pipeline but can still require many months of lab work to verify results. The idea of an AI scientist is to automate that work too.

An AI scientist sits in a layer above those human-made tools and calls on them as needed, says Rowstron. “There’s a point in time—and I don’t think it’s a decade away—where that AI scientist layer says, ‘I need a tool and it doesn’t exist,’ and it will actually create an AlphaFold kind of tool just on the way to figuring out how to solve another problem. That whole bottom zone will just be automated.”

But we&#39;re not there yet, he says. All the projects ARIA is now funding involve systems that call on existing tools rather than spin up new ones.

There are also unsolved problems with agentic systems in general, which limits how long they can run by themselves without going off the rails and making errors. For example, a study, titled “Why LLMs aren’t scientists yet,” posted online last week by researchers at Lossfunk, an AI lab based in India, reports that in an experiment to get LLM agents to run a scientific workflow to completion, the system failed three out of four times. According to the researchers, the reasons the LLMs broke down included “deviation from original research specifications toward simpler, more familiar solutions” and “overexcitement that declares success despite obvious failures.”

“Obviously, at the moment these tools are still fairly early in their cycle and these things might plateau,” says Rowstron. “I’m not expecting them to win a Nobel Prize.”

“But there is a world where some of these tools will force us to operate so much quicker,” he continues. “And if we end up in that world, it’s super important for us to be ready.”

Nandan Nilekani can’t stop trying to push India into the future. He started nearly 30 years ago, masterminding an ongoing experiment in technological state capacity that started with Aadhaar—the world’s largest digital identity system.

Using Aadhaar as the bedrock, Nilekani and people working with him went on to build a sprawling collection of free, interoperating online tools that add up to nothing less than a digital infrastructure for society, covering government services, banking, and health care. They offer convenience and access that would be eye-popping in wealthy countries a tenth of India’s size.

At 70 years old, Nilekani should be retired. But he has a few more ideas. Read our profile to learn about what he’s set his sights on next.

Many Americans agree that it’s acceptable to screen embryos for severe genetic diseases. Far fewer say it’s okay to test for characteristics related to a future child’s appearance, behavior, or intelligence. But a few startups are now advertising what they claim is a way to do just that.

This new kind of testing—which can cost up to $50,000—is incredibly controversial. Nevertheless, the practice has grown popular in Silicon Valley, and it’s becoming more widely available to everyone. Read the full story.

On the outskirts of Charlottesville, Virginia, a new kind of sugar factory is taking shape. The facility is being developed by a startup called Bonumose. It uses a processed corn product called maltodextrin that is found in many junk foods and is calorically similar to table sugar (sucrose).

But for Bonumose, maltodextrin isn’t an ingredient—it’s a raw material. When it’s poured into the company’s bioreactors, what emerges is tagatose. Found naturally in small concentrations in fruit, some grains, and milk, it is nearly as sweet as sucrose but apparently with only around half the calories, and wider health benefits.

Bonumose’s process originated in a company spun out of the Virginia Tech lab of Yi-Heng “Percival” Zhang. When MIT Technology Review spoke to Zhang, he was sitting alone in an empty lab in Tianjin, China, after serving a two-year sentence of supervised release in Virginia for conspiracy to defraud the US government, making false statements, and obstruction of justice. If sugar is the new oil, the global battle to control it has already begun. Read the full story.

Just before Christmas the Trump administration dramatically escalated its war on digital rights by banning five people from entering the US. One of them, Josephine Ballon, is a director of HateAid, a small German nonprofit founded to support the victims of online harassment and violence. The organization is a strong advocate of EU tech regulations, and so finds itself attacked in campaigns from right-wing politicians and provocateurs who claim that it engages in censorship.

EU officials, freedom of speech experts, and the five people targeted all flatly reject these accusations. Ballon told us that their work is fundamentally about making people feel safer online. But their experiences over the past few weeks show just how politicized and besieged their work in online safety has become. Read the full story.

Chatbots are skilled at crafting sophisticated dialogue and mimicking empathetic behavior. They never get tired of chatting. It’s no wonder, then, that so many people now use them for companionship—forging friendships or even romantic relationships. 72% of US teenagers have used AI for companionship, according to a study from the nonprofit Common Sense Media. But while chatbots can provide much-needed emotional support and guidance for some people, they can exacerbate underlying problems in others—especially vulnerable people or those with mental health issues.

Although some early attempts to regulate this space are underway, AI companionship is going nowhere.

It’s a “complex and subtle emotion that elicits feelings of comfort, serenity, and a gentle sense of floating.” It’s peaceful, but more ephemeral and intangible than contentment. It might be evoked by the sight of a sunset or a moody, low-key album.

If you haven’t ever felt this sensation—or even heard of it—that’s not surprising. A Reddit user generated it with ChatGPT, along with advice on how to evoke the feeling. Don’t scoff: Researchers say more and more terms for these “neo-­emotions” are showing up online, describing new dimensions and aspects of feeling. Read our story to learn more about why.

Instead, he found himself trafficked into a business commonly known as “pig butchering”—a form of fraud in which scammers form close relationships with targets online and extract money from them. The Chinese crime syndicates behind the scams have netted billions of dollars, and they have used violence and coercion to force their workers, many of them trafficked like Gavesh, to carry out the frauds from large compounds, several of which operate openly in the quasi-lawless borderlands of Myanmar.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Berlin’s energy transition sector got a defining boost today as Cloover, a climate fintech based in Berlin, announced it has secured more than $1.2 billion in total capital commitments, combining Series A equity and a substantial debt facility to accelerate the rollout of its software and financing platform across Europe.

The financing package includes €18.8 million (approximately $22 million) in Series A equity, led by MMC Ventures and QED Investors, with participation from Lowercarbon Capital, BNVT Capital, Bosch Ventures, Centrotec, and Earthshot Ventures.

Alongside that, a €1.02 billion debt facility provided by a major European bank will be deployed directly as customer and installer financing through Cloover’s platform, backed by a €300 million guarantee from the European Investment Fund to support scalable, low-cost lending for clean energy projects.

For a company that only a few years ago was in seed-stage fundraising, the scale of these commitments marks a striking shift. The debt element is operational capital designed to help manufacturers, installers, and homeowners finance solar panels, batteries, heat pumps, and other distributed energy technologies under a single unified system.

Cloover was founded in 2023 by Jodok Betschart, Peder Broms, and Valentin Gönczy, who arrived at the idea after interviewing hundreds of installers across Europe and hearing the same frustrations: fragmented software stacks, manual processes, and limited access to project financing. They saw a structural gap in the energy transition; demand for decentralised power had surged, but the financing and platform infrastructure to scale it weren’t keeping pace.

That gap is what Cloover’s platform intends to close. At its core is an integrated operating system that combines workflow management, procurement, financing, energy optimisation, and risk analytics into one environment that serves all parts of the distributed energy value chain. Installers can offer financing at the point of sale, streamline operations, and reduce administrative drag.

Homeowners, in turn, gain access to installations with lower upfront costs and financing terms linked to projected energy savings rather than traditional credit scoring.

Some investors now call Cloover the “Shopify for energy”, a digital backbone that supports the entire process of deploying distributed energy systems at scale. The model is built around scalable capital deployment combined with end-to-end software automation, including AI-driven tools for underwriting and operations.
The timing of this financing is noteworthy.

Across Europe, demand for residential solar and decentralised energy solutions is accelerating as regulatory pressure, rising electricity prices, and broader electrification trends push households and businesses toward clean alternatives. Yet installers often struggle with financing bottlenecks. Cloover’s platform embeds capital directly into the sales workflow, turning financing from a hurdle into a built-in feature.

In a statement, CEO Jodok Betschart framed the new financing as a way to enable energy independence without the friction of upfront costs or complex loan applications, noting that the company’s AI operating system connects stakeholders across the value chain.

For European climate tech and energy markets, the scale of Cloover’s backing is remarkable. Few startups in this space have bridged software infrastructure and finance at this magnitude, and the size of the debt commitment signals deep lender confidence in distributed energy as a growth asset class.

It sets a potential precedent for how renewable energy projects can be financed and adopted more quickly across the region, something both policymakers and industry leaders have identified as essential to meeting the EU’s climate goals.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">To many readers, this may sound like a paradox: how can knowledge ever become invaluable?

In this article, I want to explore how corporate knowledge, when poorly structured and rigidly transferred, can slowly transform from an asset into a disadvantage. Not only for companies, but especially for employees. And over time, that disadvantage compounds.

The journey usually looks familiar. You apply for a job, speak with a recruiter, send your CV, go through interviews, and eventually receive the green-light email: “Congratulations, you’re hired.”

This moment takes us directly to the real turning point: the onboarding process.

Those first one, two, sometimes even three months when you are introduced to the people, the tools, the workflows, the strategies, and the “way things are done.” On paper, onboarding exists to accelerate integration and performance. In reality, in many corporations, it quietly becomes an indoctrination phase.

Relatable to anyone who has worked in large organizations, onboarding often shifts from enabling understanding to enforcing conformity. New hires are not only taught what the company knows, but also what the company no longer questions.

This is where corporate knowledge starts becoming invaluable.

Because instead of acting as a foundation to build on, it becomes a ceiling.

It tells you what to do, how to do it, and more importantly, what not to rethink. Over time, this “do according to the manual” culture doesn’t just standardize execution. It standardizes thinking. And standardized thinking is the natural enemy of innovation.

History shows us a consistent pattern: breakthroughs rarely come from the center of an industry. They come from the edges.

Elon Musk was not an automotive executive. He treated cars as computers on wheels and energy systems. The result? An entire industry forced to reset its assumptions.

Travis Kalanick and Garrett Camp were not transportation insiders. They were technologists. They saw GPS-enabled phones, invisible payments, and drivers that didn’t need to be owned. They reframed taxis not as a fleet problem, but as a software and trust problem. And the taxi industry, as it existed, effectively ended.

These examples point to a simple truth: transformative ideas usually emerge from new mental models, not from perfected manuals.

Yet most onboarding processes are designed to remove new mental models as quickly as possible.

They don’t ask: “What do you see that we no longer notice?”
 They ask: “How fast can you adapt to how we already work?”

Most programs teach tools, not systems. New hires learn where to click, not how to think. They are trained on CRMs, scripts, workflows, and reporting routines, but not on AI-assisted decision-making, signal-based prospecting, or how to design work alongside automated agents.

As a result, organizations scale activity instead of intelligence.

Even worse, onboarding still assumes that humans should work like software: following rigid processes, filling manual reports, executing predefined sequences. Instead of being taught how to orchestrate software, delegate to AI, and concentrate on judgment, creativity, and relationships.

Over time, this creates a paradoxical outcome: the more “knowledge” an organization accumulates, the harder it becomes for new ideas to survive inside it.

And when knowledge can no longer be challenged, recombined, or re-imagined, it stops being knowledge.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">In a Davos dominated by talk of tariffs, subsidies, and geopolitical risk, Europe used the stage to question its own economic limits. At the World Economic Forum, Ursula von der Leyen put forward one of the clearest signals yet that the European Union is preparing a structural shift in how it treats business, competitiveness, and economic power.

The phrase that stuck, “Europe Inc”, is not the name of a regulation, nor a new Brussels invention ready to roll out. It is a political framing for a shift that the European Commission wants to accelerate.

What Europe Inc actually refers to is an idea long discussed in EU policy circles and now pushed into the spotlight: the so-called 28th regime. An optional, EU-wide corporate framework that would sit alongside national systems and allow companies to operate across the bloc under a single legal structure.

The problem it is meant to solve is real and well-documented. Europe has a single market in theory, but in practice, companies still face 27 different company laws, registration processes, capital requirements, and administrative timelines. Startups incorporate in one country, then struggle to expand. Scaleups hit legal friction. Many leave.

The latest rumblings from the EU tech scene, a story from our wise ol&#39; founder Boris, and some questionable AI art. It&#39;s free, every week, in your inbox. Sign up now!

The Commission’s answer is simplification through centralisation. Under the proposed 28th regime, entrepreneurs would be able to set up a company digitally, once and use that structure across the EU. One registration, one legal form, one set of rules. The ambition presented at Davos goes further: company creation within 48 hours, fully online.

That figure matters. It is also where political ambition risks being read as immediate reality.

The 48-hour setup is not in force. It is a target attached to a proposal that still needs to be formally drafted, negotiated, and approved by both the European Parliament and member states. Nothing in current EU law allows this yet. What exists is intent, not implementation.

Von der Leyen was explicit about why this push is happening now. Global conditions have hardened. Trade is increasingly weaponised. Industrial policy has returned, unapologetically, in the US and China.

Supply chain shocks and energy crises exposed Europe’s vulnerabilities. In that environment, regulatory fragmentation stops being a technical issue and becomes a strategic one.

Europe Inc is Brussels admitting that rules alone do not build power. Scale does. There is also a political recalibration underway. The EU has traditionally defined itself as a regulator first, a market shaper second.

The message from Davos suggests a change in emphasis: competitiveness, capital mobilisation, and strategic autonomy are moving closer to the centre of EU policymaking.

Still, limits remain. The 28th regime, as currently described, would be optional. It would not harmonise taxation overnight. Labour law, insolvency rules, and social policy remain largely national domains. Europe Inc would coexist with national systems, not replace them.

That coexistence is both its strength and its risk. Optional frameworks can attract fast-growing companies, but they can also deepen a two-speed Europe if not carefully designed. This tension is not resolved yet.

What Davos revealed is not a finished Europe Inc, but a Commission willing to say openly that Europe’s economic model, as it stands, is too slow for the world it operates in. Whether Europe Inc becomes a meaningful tool or another unrealised promise will depend less on slogans and more on legislation, compromise, and political courage across 27 capitals.

For now, Europe Inc is best understood as a warning shot. Europe intends to compete as a bloc, not as a collection of administrative borders. The clock, as von der Leyen implied, is already running.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Belgian business software company Odoo, also a unicorn, has reached a fresh milestone. Growth investor General Atlantic has increased its stake in the firm, buying additional shares from regional backer Wallonie Entreprendre and pushing Odoo’s valuation to roughly €7 billion.

This move isn’t a typical funding round where a company raises new capital. Instead, it’s a secondary transaction: General Atlantic bought existing shares that were previously held by Wallonie Entreprendre, the investment arm of Belgium’s Walloon region. After the deal, Wallonie Entreprendre still holds about 3 % of the company.

Odoo was founded in 2002 in Belgium and has grown steadily from a small project into a global software platform. It offers an integrated suite of business applications used by small and medium-sized enterprises for everything from finance and sales to HR and marketing.

The software is built on an open-core model that encourages developers around the world to build add-on apps, creating a vast ecosystem of nearly 40,000 extensions.

Today, Odoo counts more than 170,000 paying customers in around 180 countries. That global footprint and the steady revenue growth it has delivered helped convince General Atlantic to deepen its involvement.

Since first investing in the company in 2023, the firm has supported Odoo’s expansion into new markets and helped refine its commercial strategy.

Part of what makes this update noteworthy is how Odoo has expanded its product offerings. Its newest versions include AI-infused features and automation tools that make the suite more attractive to businesses looking to replace outdated, fragmented systems with a single, unified digital platform.

For the European tech scene, this development highlights a shift in how successful software companies grow and attract capital. Rather than chasing quick exits or IPOs, some founders are choosing secondary share deals to let early investors realise gains while keeping strategic control.

That path can make it easier for companies to stay private longer and focus on building value over time.

I don’t know what is happening in Belgium or what they are having for breakfast, but the country itself has quietly become a place where software businesses can scale internationally.

Odoo is one of its standout success stories, showing that strong product focus, community-driven development, and global reach can win serious backing from major growth investors.

            <div id="article-text">For a long time, tech events were built around scale. The bigger the crowd, the stronger the perception of success. Attendance numbers became a proxy for impact, and festivals grew year after year because that was what the industry expected.

That model no longer fits how tech leaders work today.

Over the past years, I have spent time in conversations with founders, executives, and operators who carry real responsibility inside their organizations. As a community builder, I often speak with them before they commit to attending events. Their questions are direct. They want to know who will be in the room, how discussions are structured, and whether the environment allows honest exchange.

Almost none of them ask how many people will attend.

This is a meaningful signal. Leaders who run companies do not optimize for visibility. They already have it. They want rooms where time leads to insight, clarity, and decisions.

As CEO of Tekpon AI Summit, I have had a front row seat to how decision makers actually want to engage today. I have watched what happens on large stages. I have also watched what happens when ten relevant people sit around one table with no audience and no agenda beyond honest discussion.

The difference in outcome is hard to ignore. In small rooms, people speak openly. They share challenges they would never publish. They explore partnerships without formalities. They make decisions faster because trust forms naturally when everyone present has earned their place in the conversation.

In larger settings, the dynamic changes. Conversations stay cautious. Stories become polished. The real questions are postponed, usually for later. Later often disappears into busy schedules.

Large conferences still play a role. They introduce new voices to the ecosystem. They create energy. They give exposure to early-stage founders. That contribution remains valuable.

But they are no longer where serious business gets done.

The work that shapes companies happens in environments where attention is protected and trust forms quickly. Where people can speak without performing. Where context is shared. Where participants know that what is said in the room stays in the room. These conditions are difficult to build at a mass scale and natural in small, curated settings.

This has already changed how senior decision makers allocate their time. Many are reducing their presence at large events. They are choosing closed discussions, private dinners, and carefully selected gatherings where every participant has a reason to be there. They are not rejecting conferences. They are rejecting formats that do not respect their attention.

The industry is slow to react to this shift. Event strategies still chase attendance growth, sponsorship volume, and social media reach. Meanwhile, the people shaping companies are quietly changing their behavior. They are voting with their calendars.

This gap will continue to widen. Events that optimize for volume will struggle to attract senior leaders. Once you see this up close, it becomes hard to unsee. The criteria for choosing where to meet have changed. Not loudly, not publicly, but consistently.

Some will still chase scale. Others will keep building large festivals and broad platforms. There is nothing wrong with that. But the people shaping companies are already making different choices. They are selecting rooms where conversations move faster, trust forms naturally, and time feels respected.

That is where tech leaders now choose to meet.

            <a class="original-link" href="https://thenextweb.com/news/sequoia-joins-anthropics-25b-funding-round">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Venture capital powerhouse Sequoia Capital is preparing to invest in Anthropic, the AI startup best known for its Claude family of large language models, in one of the largest private funding rounds in tech this year. The deal is being led by Singapore’s GIC and U.S. investor Coatue, each contributing roughly $1.5 billion, as part of a planned raise of $25 billion or more at a staggering $350 billion valuation.

This move stands out for two reasons: the size and speed of the valuation surge and the fact that Sequoia, already an investor in rival AI builders such as OpenAI and Elon Musk’s xAI, is broadening its exposure across competing AI platforms.

Traditionally, top-tier VC firms have avoided backing direct competitors simultaneously. The logic was simple: protect information flows and avoid internal conflicts of interest. Sequoia’s willingness to back Anthropic despite existing stakes in other AI outfits signals a shift in how investors view the AI market. It reflects a belief that the sector is large enough to support multiple winners rather than requiring firms to choose a single champion.

Anthropic itself has grown quickly since its founding by former OpenAI researchers. Industry reporting shows the company has attracted significant talent from established AI labs and introduced advanced models and enterprise features, contributing to its rapid valuation climb over the past year.

A $350 billion valuation, even before a public listing, is eye-watering. It resets expectations for what private AI companies can command and puts pressure on competitors to secure equally large capital backing or risk falling behind. Analysts suggest that few AI firms may go public at these valuations, pointing instead to continued private rounds or alternative exit strategies if market sentiment shifts.

That dynamic is a symptom of a broader trend: a global AI capital rush that has persisted even amid concerns about a bust cycle or a funding slowdown in other tech segments. Investors remain convinced that AI will reshape industries from software to logistics, health care, and beyond, and are willing to deploy extraordinary sums to secure influence in that future.

For European markets and founders, the Sequoia-Anthropic deal carries both opportunities and warnings. Europe has strong academic AI talent, an active startup ecosystem, and deep expertise in areas like robotics, industrial automation, and data privacy.

Yet venture capital density still trails the U.S., and marquee AI funding rounds of this scale are rare on the continent.
This investment could accelerate European interest in AI startups, drawing more attention and potentially more capital into the region.

It reinforces the idea that global capital flows are not limited by geography and that talent mobility, not territory, increasingly defines the AI race. European AI talent has been moving among global hubs, and deals like this underline how strongly competitive pressures are shaping that movement.

At the same time, the concentration of huge capital in a few dominant players raises strategic questions for European policymakers and investors. If global valuations continue to centralise power and resources in U.S. and Asia-based AI giants, Europe’s AI initiatives may struggle to build regional champions with equivalent scale.

Efforts to foster AI ecosystems, from regulatory clarity to public funding mechanisms, will be tested in the face of such capital dynamics.

Sequoia’s bet on Anthropic, despite its exposure to rivals, underscores a fundamental truth about where the AI race is headed: talent and execution matter more than regional advantage.

For European startups, this means honing in on distinctive technical niches, enterprise traction, and real-world impact rather than simply following headline valuations.

The Anthropic round may be a moment of spectacle, but its lasting impact will be measured in how ecosystems evolve, how talent flows, and how global competition shapes opportunities for innovation across borders. European players can benefit from these trends, but only if they leverage their own strengths in research, ethics-led deployment, and deep industry partnerships.

In the end, this deal isn’t just about money; it’s a signal of where confidence lies in the next chapter of AI, and who stands to gain as a result.
