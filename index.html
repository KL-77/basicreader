            <h2>Core Ultra Series 3 launch may be hampered by chip shortages, says Intel</h2>
            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-01-23</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2026/01/core-ultra-series-3-launch-may-be-hampered-by-chip-shortages-says-intel/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Intel reported its earnings for the fourth quarter of 2025 yesterday, and the news both for the quarter and for the year was mixed: year-over-year revenue was down nearly imperceptibly, from $53.1 billion to $52.9 billion, while revenue for the quarter was down about four percent, from $14.3 billion last year to $13.7 billion this year. (That number was, nevertheless, on the high end of Intel’s guidance for the quarter, which ranged from $12.8 to $13.8 billion.)

Diving deeper into the numbers makes it clear exactly where money is being made and lost: Intel’s data center and AI products were up 9 percent for the quarter and 5 percent for the year, while its client computing group (which sells Core processors, Arc GPUs, and other consumer products) was down 7 percent for the quarter and 3 percent for the year.

That knowledge makes it slightly easier to understand the bind that company executives talked about on Intel’s earnings call (as transcribed by Investing.com). In short, Intel is having trouble making (and buying) enough chips to meet demand, and it makes more sense to allocate the chips it can make to the divisions that are actually making money—which means that we could see shortages of or higher prices for consumer processors, just as Intel is gearing up to launch the promising Core Ultra Series 3 processors (codenamed Panther Lake).

Intel CFO David Zinsner indicated that Intel is “prioritizing [its] internal wafer supply to data center” and having more of its consumer chips made externally. Substantial portions of the Core Ultra Series 3 processors are manufactured at Intel, after the company primarily used TSMC’s chip factories for the Core Ultra Series 2 designs.

“We can’t completely vacate the client market,” said Zinsner, but Intel is “shifting as much as we can over to data center to meet the high demand.”

Compounding this is that yields for the new 18A process—that is, the number of chips in a wafer with no defects that can work as designed—are still improving. Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan said that “while yields are in line with our internal plans, they are still below what I want them to be.”

Yields are currently improving by 7 or 8 percent every month, according to Intel. But that could be building on pretty low initial yields—reporting from last summer suggested that just 10 percent of the chips coming off of the 18A production lines were meeting Intel’s requirements at the time. Intel predicts that its supply will have ramped up enough within the next few months to help alleviate shortages.

“I do believe that the first quarter is the trough,” said Zinsner. “We will improve supply in the second quarter.”

When Intel can start making enough chips to meet its demand, it ought to help brighten the company’s earnings reports.

“We delivered [our Q4 2025] results despite supply constraints, which meaningfully limited our ability to capture all of the strengths in our underwriting markets,” said Tan. “We are working aggressively to address this and better support our customers’ needs going forward.”

Intel has been signaling for a while now that it was selling essentially all of the chips it could get its hands on. Intel investor relations VP John Pitzer said last month that Intel would be selling more of both its Lunar Lake and Arrow Lake Core Ultra Series 2 chips for consumers, as well as its Granite Rapids chips for data centers, if it could get more of them.

As Intel seeks to improve its position in the short term, the company also says that it’s still making progress on its future manufacturing nodes, including different versions of the 18A process and the upcoming 14A process. Intel is working to engage “potential external customers” who would use the 14A process to make their own chips. If these third parties decide to use Intel’s manufacturing facilities, Intel expects to know about it “starting in the second half of this year and extending into the first half of 2027,” and then it expects to build out manufacturing capacity based on the number of external customers it finds.

On the chip design side, Intel also expects to have its first next-generation Nova Lake chips ready “at the end of 2026.” We don’t know much about Nova Lake yet, but it should be Intel’s next architecture to cover both desktop and laptop processors, while Panther Lake chips are intended mainly for laptops. At least part of the chip will also be manufactured using the 18A process.</div>

            <h2>DHS keeps trying and failing to unmask anonymous ICE critics online</h2>
            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-01-23</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2026/01/instagram-ice-critic-wins-fight-to-stay-anonymous-as-dhs-backs-down/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has backed down from a fight to unmask the owners of Instagram and Facebook accounts monitoring Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) activity in Pennsylvania.

One of the anonymous account holders, John Doe, sued to block ICE from identifying him and other critics online through summonses to Meta that he claimed infringed on core First Amendment-protected activity.

DHS initially fought Doe’s motion to quash the summonses, arguing that the community watch groups endangered ICE agents by posting “pictures and videos of agents’ faces, license plates, and weapons, among other things.” This was akin to “threatening ICE agents to impede the performance of their duties,” DHS alleged. DHS’s arguments echoed DHS Secretary Kristi Noem, who has claimed that identifying ICE agents is a crime, even though Wired noted that ICE employees often post easily discoverable LinkedIn profiles.

To Doe, the agency seemed intent on testing the waters to see if it could seize authority to unmask all critics online by invoking a customs statute that allows agents to subpoena information on goods entering or leaving the US.

But then, on January 16, DHS abruptly reversed course, withdrawing its summonses from Meta.

A court filing confirmed that DHS dropped its requests for subscriber information last week, after initially demanding Doe’s “postal code, country, all email address(es) on file, date of account creation, registered telephone numbers, IP address at account signup, and logs showing IP address and date stamps for account accesses.”

The filing does not explain why DHS decided to withdraw its requests.

However, previously, DHS requested similar information from Meta about six Instagram community watch groups that shared information about ICE activity in Los Angeles and other locations. DHS withdrew those requests, too, after account holders defended their First Amendment rights and filed motions to quash their summonses, Doe’s court filing said.

To defeat DHS’ summonses, Doe shared all his group’s online posts with the court. An attorney representing Doe at the American Civil Liberties Union of Pennsylvania, Ariel Shapell, told Ars that Doe’s groups posted “pretty innocuous” content, like “information and resources about immigrant rights, due process rights, fundraising, and vigils.”

It’s possible DHS caved due to lack of evidence supporting claims that Doe’s groups’ posts carried implicit threats to “assault, kidnap, or murder any federal official,” as DHS had argued. But it’s also possible that DHS keeps trying and failing to unmask ICE critics due to strong First Amendment protections working to preserve the right to post anonymously online.

The attempt to unmask Doe’s accounts came as criticism of ICE is mounting nationwide, and a win could have given ICE broad authority to attack that growing base of critics if DHS had dug in and its defense actually held.

DHS’s withdrawal of the summonses could signal that the argument the agency tried to raise—weirdly using a statute tied to the “importation/exportation of merchandise” to seize “unlimited subpoena authority” of ICE critics online—is clearly not a winning one.

Meta did not immediately respond to Ars’ request for comment. But Meta did play a role in challenging DHS’ summonses, initially by seeking more information from the agency and then notifying account holders to provide an opportunity to quash the summonses before information was shared.

So far, the playbook for community watch groups on Facebook and Instagram has been to follow Meta’s advice in order to block identifying information from being shared. But it remains unclear if Meta may have complied with DHS’s requests if account holders were not able to legally fight to quash them, perhaps leaving a vulnerable gray area for community watch groups.

For Doe and any others involved in “MontCo Community Watch,” DHS’s withdrawal of the summonses likely comes as a relief. But this wasn’t the first time DHS tried and failed to unmask online critics, so it’s just as likely that fears remain that DHS will continue trying to identify groups that are posting footage to raise awareness of ICE’s most controversial moves.

ICE critics have used footage of tragic events—like Renee Good’s killing and eight other ICE shootings since September—to support calls to remove ICE from embattled communities and abolish ICE.

Tensions remain high as US citizens defend both their neighbors and their own constitutional rights. Most recently, shocking footage of ICE using a 5-year-old boy as bait to trap other family members intensified calls to defund ICE. Public backlash also raged after videos showed ICE removing a US citizen from his home in his underwear. That arrest happened while ICE was conducting a warrantless search that a whistleblower warned is becoming the new ICE norm after an internal memo said that agents can enter homes without a judicial warrant.

Some politicians are starting to take up the call to diminish ICE’s power. On Thursday, the majority of House Democrats voted to defund ICE, which Politico noted was a “remarkable shift from when dozens of them voted to expand the Trump administration’s immigration enforcement authority just one year ago.” Of course, the ICE budget bill passed anyway, since Republicans control the House, but with public approval of ICE tanking, any ongoing pushback could hurt Republicans in midterms and eventually even doom ICE if momentum is sustained.</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The Trump White House yesterday posted a manipulated photo of Nekima Levy Armstrong, a Minnesota civil rights attorney who was arrested after protesting in a church where a pastor is allegedly also an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) official.

Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem posted what seems to be the original photo of Armstrong being led away by an officer yesterday morning. A half hour later, the official White House X account posted an altered version in which Armstrong’s face was manipulated to make it appear that she was crying.

“The White House shared an AI-edited photo of Nekima, depicting her in tears and scared when, in actuality, she was poised, determined, and unafraid,” NAACP President and CEO Derrick Johnson said yesterday.

Reader-added context on X said, “This photo has been digitally altered to make Nekima Levy Armstrong appear to be in distress. The Director of DHS herself posted the unedited photo in an earlier announcement.” White House Deputy Communications Director Kaelan Dorr defended the post after criticism of the image manipulation.

“Enforcement of the law will continue. The memes will continue. Thank you for your attention to this matter,” Dorr wrote. The White House post with the manipulated image called Levy Armstrong a “far-left agitator” who “orchestrated[ed] church riots in Minnesota.”

A DHS press release about the arrest used the same image posted by Noem, without the alteration.

Jordan Kushner, an attorney for Levy Armstrong, said, “It is just so outrageous that the White House would make up stories about someone to try and discredit them. She was completely calm and composed and rational. There was no one crying. So this is just outrageous defamation.”

Speaking to The Associated Press, Kushner also said that the “video Levy Armstrong’s husband shot ‘dismantles what they claim’ and that the video would be released soon.”

Protesters disrupted services on Sunday at the Cities Church in St. Paul, chanting “ICE OUT” and “Justice for Renee Good.” The St. Paul Pioneer Press quoted Levy Armstrong as saying, “When you think about the federal government unleashing barbaric ICE agents upon our community and all the harm that they have caused, to have someone serving as a pastor who oversees these ICE agents is almost unfathomable to me.”

The church website lists David Easterwood as one of its pastors. Protesters said this is the same David Easterwood who is listed as a defendant in a lawsuit that Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison filed against Noem and other federal officials. The lawsuit lists Easterwood as a defendant “in his official capacity as Acting Director, Saint Paul Field Office, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.”

Levy Armstrong, who is also a former president of the NAACP’s Minneapolis branch, was arrested yesterday morning. Announcing the arrest, Attorney General Pam Bondi wrote, “WE DO NOT TOLERATE ATTACKS ON PLACES OF WORSHIP.” Bondi alleged that Levy Armstrong “played a key role in organizing the coordinated attack on Cities Church in St. Paul, Minnesota.”

Noem said Levy Armstrong “is being charged with a federal crime under 18 USC 241,” which prohibits “conspir[ing] to injure, oppress, threaten, or intimidate any person in any State, Territory, Commonwealth, Possession, or District in the free exercise or enjoyment of any right or privilege secured to him by the Constitution or laws of the United States.”

“Religious freedom is the bedrock of the United States—there is no first amendment right to obstruct someone from practicing their religion,” Noem wrote.

St. Paul School Board member Chauntyll Allen was also arrested. Attorneys for the Cities Church issued statements supporting the arrests and saying they “are exploring all legal options to protect the church and prevent further invasions.”

A federal magistrate judge initially ruled that Levy Armstrong and Allen could be released, but they were still being held last night after the government “made a motion to stay the release for further review, claiming they might be flight risks,” the Pioneer Press wrote.

Kushner called the arrests a “farce” and alleged that Bondi and Noem ordered the arrests only so they could celebrate them on social media, according to the Pioneer Press. “This doesn’t happen in a legitimate prosecution,” Kushner said. “These are officials making a political decision, and purposely making a political spectacle and a political circus out of the court system for their own purposes.”

Kushner also “said federal agents detained one of Armstrong’s friends two days [previously], using force to tackle her in a hotel lobby, under the mistaken impression she was Armstrong,” the Pioneer Press wrote.

Marques Armstrong, Levy Armstrong’s husband, said she offered to turn herself in after the mistaken detention of her friend.

“Initially they agreed and then a call came from up high and said, ‘No, we have to take her there (at the hotel).’ They wanted her in handcuffs,” he was quoted as saying. An “agent took photos and said it won’t go on social media. I knew it was a lie,” he also said.

The White House’s posting of a manipulated version of the arrest photo could be used in Levy Armstrong’s legal defense. As the New York Times wrote, her lawyer could argue that the post was an improper extrajudicial statement that may prejudice potential jurors and that it shows the Justice Department filed charges vindictively. We contacted Kushner about the manipulated photo and case today and will update this article if he provides any comment.

The NAACP called for the release of Levy Armstrong, Allen, and a third arrestee, William Kelly. “Their arrests violated their constitutional rights and NAACP demands their immediate release,” the NAACP said. “Ms. Armstrong and her fellow demonstrators gathered peacefully at a church over the pastor’s alleged leadership within the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). The protests follow the increase in ICE activity and the fatal shooting of Minneapolis resident Renee Nicole Good.”

The Justice Department also tried to bring charges against journalist Don Lemon, but a judge rejected the charges. Lemon was at the demonstration but said he was there as a journalist and not a protester.</div>

            <div id="article-text">Telly, a company that accepts advertising data instead of cash for its TVs, has reportedly had a hard time getting its “free” TVs into people’s homes.

Telly debuted in May 2023. Its dual-screen design can show ads, even when people aren’t watching. Although the smaller, secondary screen can be used for more helpful applications, like showing the weather or sports scores, its primary purpose is to serve as a billboard south of the 55-inch primary display. Owners cannot disable tracking or cover up the secondary screen (or they have to pay for the TV, which Telly claims is worth $1,000), and they must fill out a lengthy, detailed survey to get one.

When it debuted its TV, Telly said it expected to ship 500,000 devices that summer. In June 2023, the startup said 250,000 people signed up to get a Telly. In a 2024 press release, Telly said that it planned to ship “millions more in 2024.”

But a report from Lowpass this week, citing a “Q3 update sent to investors in November 2025,” said the startup had 35,000 TVs in people’s homes at that time. In Q2 2025, there were 28,000 Telly TVs in use, the note said, according to Lowpass.

The publication reported that the investor note suggests Telly will order 100,000 TVs from supplier Foxconn and increase deliveries soon.

Telly declined to comment to Lowpass and didn’t respond to Ars Technica’s requests for comment.

So what gives? Based on early registration numbers, it seems Telly has generated enough interest to ship more than 35,000 TVs.

One issue seems to be poor shipping. Per the investor note that Lowpass reviewed, Telly claimed that FedEx delivered 10 percent of its shipments of Telly TVs broken. Since moving to a different company—seemingly Samsung partner RXO, based on Reddit posts—fewer Tellys are arriving broken, the company reportedly said.

As Lowpass noted, dozens of online complaints claim that the free TVs, which ship directly from Telly, were broken upon arrival. The Verge also reported receiving a broken unit in September.

Today, the subreddit dedicated to Telly TVs seems to show numerous other technical difficulties Telly users are experiencing. Technical complaints are common on subreddits for tech gadgets, but the forum highlights the problems Telly owners might encounter.

Telly’s reported failure to meet its high shipment goals or even fulfill reported demand demonstrates the scaling complexities startups can face. While some companies struggle to get people interested in their product, Telly’s “free” pitch has been successful enough to lure thousands. But in its early stages, Telly has reportedly struggled with its direct-to-consumer model and smaller team compared to other TV makers.

Still, Telly’s ad-centric business model may be starting to show its value. The investor update reportedly said Telly made $22 million in annualized revenue in Q3 2025. This could equate to about $52 in advertising revenue per Telly in use per month ($22 million divided by 35,000 TVs divided by 12 months in a year is $52.38).

That’s notably more than what other TV companies report, as Lowpass pointed out. As a comparison to other budget TV brands that rely heavily on ads and user tracking, Roku reported an average revenue per user (ARPU) of $41.49 for 2024. Vizio, meanwhile, reported an ARPU of $37.17 in 2024.

The investor note reportedly said that Telly recently raised $350 million in debt funding over two rounds. The note didn’t specify when the funding occurred or how much equity Telly has raised overall.

As smart TVs at every price point increasingly rely on software-integrated advertisements and user tracking to offset declining hardware margins and rising competition, Telly argues that its premise is forward-thinking, not far-fetched. Some longtime Telly users point to the sets’ decent image and audio quality but question their reliance on an (included) streaming stick to access popular apps, their default AI-avatar home screen, and repetitive ads.

The Verge writer Emma Roth said her Telly showed her “three of the same ads in Spanish (which I don’t speak) in a row.” There’s also concern about potentially invasive uses of the TV’s integrated camera and mic.

As the leaked investor report highlights, there are plenty of other challenges standing in the way of free, ad-supported TVs. Still, Telly’s early ARPU figures are notable enough to keep the idea alive.</div>

            <h2>TikTok deal is done; Trump wants praise while users fear MAGA tweaks</h2>
            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-01-23</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2026/01/tiktok-finalizes-trump-deal-that-allows-bytedance-to-maintain-some-control/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The TikTok deal is done, and Donald Trump is claiming a win, although it remains unclear if the joint venture he arranged with ByteDance and the Chinese government actually resolves Congress’ national security concerns.

In a press release Thursday, TikTok announced the “TikTok USDS Joint Venture LLC,” an entity established to keep TikTok operating in the US.

Giving Americans majority ownership, ByteDance retains 19.9 percent of the joint venture, the release said, which has been valued at $14 billion. Three managing investors—Silver Lake, Oracle, and MGX—each hold 15 percent, while other investors, including Dell Technologies CEO Michael Dell’s investment firm, Dell Family Office, hold smaller, undisclosed stakes.

Americans will also have majority control over the joint venture’s seven-member board. TikTok CEO Shou Chew holds ByteDance’s only seat. Finalizing the deal was a “great move,” Chew told TikTok employees in an internal memo, The New York Times reported.

Two former TikTok employees will lead the joint venture. Adam Presser, who previously served as TikTok’s global head of Operations and Trust & Safety, has been named CEO. And Kim Farrell, TikTok’s former global head of Business Operations Protection, will serve as chief security officer.

Trump has claimed the deal meets requirements for “qualified divestiture” to avoid a TikTok ban otherwise required under the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act. However, questions remain, as lawmakers have not yet analyzed the terms of the deal to determine whether that’s true.

The law requires the divestment “to end any ‘operational relationship’ between ByteDance and TikTok in the United States,” critics told the NYT. That could be a problem, since TikTok’s release makes it clear that ByteDance will maintain some control over the TikTok US app’s operations.

For example, while the US owners will retrain the algorithm and manage data security, ByteDance owns the algorithm and “will manage global product interoperability and certain commercial activities, including e-commerce, advertising, and marketing.” The Trump administration seemingly agreed to these terms to ensure that the US TikTok isn’t cut off from the rest of the world on the app.

“Interoperability enables the Joint Venture to provide US users with a global TikTok experience, ensuring US creators can be discovered and businesses can operate on a global scale,” the release said.

Perhaps also concerning to Congress, Slate noted, while ByteDance may be a minority owner, it remains the largest individual shareholder.

Michael Sobolik, an expert on US-China policy and senior fellow at the right-leaning think tank the Hudson Institute, told the NYT that the Trump administration “may have saved TikTok, but the national security concerns are still going to continue.”

Some critics, including Republicans, have vowed to scrutinize the deal.

On Thursday, Senator Edward Markey (D-Mass.) complained that the White House had repeatedly denied requests for information about the deal. They’ve provided “virtually no details about this agreement, including whether TikTok’s algorithm is truly free of Chinese influence,” Markey said.

“This lack of transparency reeks,” Markey said. “Congress has a responsibility to investigate this deal, demand transparency, and ensure that any arrangement truly protects national security while keeping TikTok online.”

In December, Representative John Moolenaar (R-Mich.), chair of the House Select Committee on China, said that he wants to hold a hearing with TikTok leadership to discuss how the deal addresses national security concerns. On Thursday, Moolenaar said he “has two specific questions for TikTok’s new American owners,” Punchbowl News reported.

“Can we ensure that the algorithm is not influenced by the Chinese Communist Party?” Moolenaar said. “And two, can we ensure that the data of Americans is secure?”

Moolenaar may be satisfied by the terms, as the NYT suggested that China hawks in Washington appeared to trust that Trump’s arrangement is a qualified divestiture. TikTok’s release said that Oracle will protect US user data in a secure US cloud data environment that will regularly be audited by third-party cybersecurity experts. The algorithm will be licensed from ByteDance and retrained on US user data, the release said, and Vice President JD Vance has confirmed that the joint venture “will have control over how the algorithm pushes content to users.”

Last September, a spokesperson for the House China Committee told Politico that “any agreement must comply with the historic bipartisan law passed last year to protect the American people, including the complete divestment of ByteDance control and a fully decoupled algorithm.”

“I am so happy to have helped in saving TikTok!” Trump said on Truth Social after the deal was finalized. “It will now be owned by a group of Great American Patriots and Investors, the Biggest in the World, and will be an important Voice.”

However, it’s unclear to TikTokers how the app might change as Trump allies take control of the addictive algorithm that drew millions to the app. Lawmakers had feared the Chinese Communist Party could influence the algorithm to target US users with propaganda, and Trump’s deal was supposed to mitigate that.

Not only do critics worry that if ByteDance maintains ownership of the algorithm, it could allow the company to continue to influence content, but there is now concern that the app’s recommendations could take a right-leaning slant under US control.

Trump has already said that he’d like to see TikTok go “100 percent MAGA,” and his allies will now be in charge of “deciding which posts to leave up and which to take down,” the NYT noted. Anupam Chander, a law and technology professor at Georgetown University, told the NYT that the TikTok deal offered Trump and his allies “more theoretical room for one side’s views to get a greater airing.”

“My worry all along is that we may have traded fears of foreign propaganda for the reality of domestic propaganda,” Chander said.

For business owners who rely on the app, there’s also the potential that the app could be glitchy after US owners start porting data and retraining the algorithm.

Trump clearly hopes the deal will endear him to TikTok users. He sought praise on Truth Social, writing, “I only hope that long into the future I will be remembered by those who use and love TikTok.”

So far, the Chinese government has not commented on the deal’s finalization, but Trump thanked Chinese President Xi Jinping in his Truth Social post “for working with us and, ultimately, approving the Deal.”

“He could have gone the other way, but didn’t, and is appreciated for his decision,” Trump said.

Experts have suggested that China benefits from the deal by keeping the most lucrative part of TikTok while the world watches it export its technology to the US.

When Trump first announced the deal in September, critics immediately attacked him for letting China keep the algorithm. One US advisor close to the deal told the Financial Times that “Trump always chickens out,” noting that “after all this, China keeps the algorithm.”

On Thursday, Sobolik told Politico that Trump “got played” by Xi after taking “terrible advice from his staff” during trade negotiations that some critics said gave China the upper hand.

Trump sees things differently, writing on Truth Social that the TikTok deal came to “a very dramatic, final, and beautiful conclusion.”

Whether the deal is “dramatic,” “final,” or “beautiful” depends on who you ask, though, as it could face legal challenges and disrupt TikTok’s beloved content feeds. The NYT suggested that the deal took so long to finalize that TikTokers don’t even care anymore, while several outlets noted that Trump’s deal is very close to the Project Texas arrangement that Joe Biden pushed until it was deemed inadequate to address national security risks.

Through Project Texas, Oracle was supposed to oversee TikTok US user data, auditing for security risks while ByteDance controlled the code. The joint venture’s “USDS” “coinage even originated from Project Texas,” Slate noted.

Lindsay Gorman, a former senior advisor in the Biden administration, told NYT that “we’ve gone round and round and ended up not too far from where we started.”</div>

            <h2>Tesla kills Autopilot, locks lane-keeping behind $99/month fee</h2>
            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-01-23</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2026/01/tesla-wants-recurring-revenue-discontinues-autopilot-in-favor-of-fsd/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Love it or hate it, Tesla has been responsible for helping to shape the tastes of automotive consumers over the past decade-plus. Over-the-air updates that add more features, an all-touchscreen human-machine interface, large castings, and hands-free driver assists were all introduced or popularized by Tesla’s electric vehicles, prompting other automakers to copy them, mostly in the hopes of seeing the same stratospheric gains in their stock prices. But starting on Valentine’s Day, if you want your Tesla to steer itself, you’ll have to pay a $99 monthly subscription fee.

Tesla currently offers a pair of so-called “level 2” partially automated driver assist systems. Autopilot is the older of these, combining Tesla’s adaptive cruise control (Tesla calls this TACC) and lane-keeping assist (Tesla calls this Autosteer). FSD is the newer system, meant to be more capable and for use on surface streets and divided-lane highways. Although the company and Tesla CEO Elon Musk regularly tout these systems’ capabilities, both still require the human driver to provide situational awareness.

But Autopilot has been under fire from regulators and the courts. Multiple wrongful death lawsuits are in the works, and after a high-profile loss resulting in a $329 million judgment against Tesla, expect many of these suits to be settled. Both the federal government and California have investigated whether Tesla misled customers, and in December, an administrative law judge ruled that Tesla indeed engaged in deceptive marketing by implying that its cars could drive themselves. The judge suspended Tesla’s license to sell cars in California, a decision that the California Department of Motor Vehicles stayed for 60 days.

Tesla was told that if it couldn’t resolve the deceptive marketing within those 60 days, the sales suspension would take effect. That would be bad for the automaker, as California is far and away its largest market in the US, albeit one that is shrinking each quarter. Having to suspend sales entirely in the state would be disastrous. Some had speculated that Tesla could change Autopilot’s name to something less misleading, but the company chose a more drastic approach.

Now, if you want your new Tesla to steer itself—while you pay attention to the road—you will have to pay for FSD. Until the middle of February, that can be done for a one-time fee of $8,000. But starting on February 14, that option goes away, too, and the sole choice will be a $99/month FSD subscription.

But probably not for very long. Last night, Musk revealed on his social media platform that “the $99/month for supervised FSD will rise as FSD’s capabilities improve. The massive value jump is when you can be on your phone or sleeping for the entire ride (unsupervised FSD).”

The quest for recurring revenue streams is becoming something of a holy grail in the automotive industry as OEMs that previously treated their customers as a single sale now hope to make themselves more attractive to investors by encouraging customers to give them regular payouts.

This may have contributed to General Motors’ decision to drop Apple CarPlay and Android Automotive. BMW has also experimented with subscription services. Tesla’s stock price remains so high that such games are probably unnecessary here, but with falling profit margins, declining sales, and the loss of emissions credits to bolster the bottom line, one can see why regular cash infusions from Tesla drivers would be desirable.</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Elon Musk tried to pick a fight with a major airline CEO — who says thanks for all the additional business you’re bringing in with your public tantrum, sucker.

“We love these PR spats that drive bookings on Ryanair,” the budget airline’s chief Michael O’Leary said at a news conference in Dublin on Wednesday, as quoted by CNN. “And we want to thank him sincerely for the additional publicity.”

The trash talking began last week when the Irish airline, the largest in Europe, said it wouldn’t install its fleet with Starlink technology, a satellite-based internet service operated by Musk’s company SpaceX. O’Leary claimed that the Starlink antennas would add drag to the planes and drive up fuel costs.

Musk could barely hide the sting he felt from the snub. He initially responded by calling O’Leary “misinformed” and added that he doubted Ryanair “can even measure the difference in fuel use accurately.”

Smelling controversy, O’Leary went on a interview with the Irish radio station Newstalk to taunt the world’s richest man.

“I would pay no attention whatsoever to Elon Musk,” O’Leary said. “He’s an idiot. Very wealthy, but he’s still an idiot. What Elon Musk knows about flights and drag would be zero.”

Musk, naturally, took the bait. O’Leary was no longer merely “misinformed,” but a “retarded twat who needs to be fired,” he seethed in response to the official Ryanair X account joking that wifi on planes was a scam.

Musk even threatened to buy out the airliner and posted a poll asking his fans whether he should “restore Ryan as their rightful ruler” once he does. Clearly, Grok was not consulted before putting up the poll: the “Ryan” Musk is presumably referring to is the Irish billionaire Tony Ryan, who died in 2007.

O’Leary didn’t back down. Tagging Musk’s account, the Ryanair account announced that it was launching a “Great Idiots seat sale” dedicated to “Elon and any other idiots on ‘X,&#39;” and that O’Leary would be giving a press conference “to address (undress??)” Musk’s “latest Twitshit.” (Yes, they went there.)

“The insufferable, special needs chimp currently running Ryan Air is an accountant,” he fumed in response to the announcement. “Has no idea how airplanes even fly.”

Ryanair and its CEO, not unlike Musk, are no strangers to controversy and often actively court it. Musk, though, is being thoroughly outdone at his own shtick. At the Wednesday conference, O’Leary gloated about the success of the “Big Idiot Seat Sale” and said he wasn’t bothered by Musk’s tirades.

“As anybody with teenage children would know, you’re frequently called an idiot and a twat at home,” he said, per CNN. “I don’t need to go outside to be insulted.”

He also said that while only European citizens could own European airlines, Musk was welcome to pour money into the company. “We would think it’s a very good investment, certainly a significantly better investment than the financial returns he is earning on X.”

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">It’s an agonizing time for the labor market in the US, where unemployment is on the rise and wages are stagnant. Though there’s raging debate over what degree of blame AI holds for the sorry state of the job market, one thing’s for sure:workers are growing increasingly furious with the tech, which they perceive as undercutting what little job security they had.

Business leaders, as a result, are becoming anxious about the blowback — even as they rhapsodize about the coming AI revolution.

At the World Monetary Fund summit at Davos, for instance, International Monetary Fund managing director Kristalina Georgieva launched into a talk on AI by calling it a “major factor for economic growth.”

“We see potential to up of 0.8 percent boost to growth over the next years, but it is hitting the labor market like a tsunami, and most countries and most businesses are not prepared for it,” she fretted.

Her anxious comments come after a year of dramatic layoffs and hiring slowdowns, in which major firms have often pointed at AI. Salesforce CEO Mark Benioff, for example, said in September that he’d cut 4,000 customer support jobs because he “needs less heads” thanks to automation. In October, Amazon initiated its largest round of layoffs ever, slashing 14,000 office jobs while citing AI as a major factor.

It should come as no surprise to those same business leaders that John Q. Public is growing increasingly angry over the narrative that AI is taking its jobs.

In its Global Talent Trends 2026 report flagged by CNBC, the analytics firm Mercer found that shop-floor concerns about AI-fueled job loss have surged from 28 percent in 2024 to 40 percent in 2026.

The firm’s research also found that 62 percent of employees feel their leaders underestimate the psychological and emotional impact of AI. And why shouldn’t they? Executives have spent the last year bragging about the supposed AI revolution, rhetoric they’ve used to game enough investment dollars to fundamentally alter the US economy.

Workers, in turn, shouldn’t be blamed for taking their lead — though in today’s economy, it seems they’re the only ones expected to pay the price.

            <h2>There’s Reportedly a Car Secretly Following Every Tesla Robotaxi, and the Reason Why Is So Absurd You Aren’t Going to Believe It</h2>
            <p><strong>Futurism | 2026-01-23</strong></p>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">When Tesla launched its Robotaxi service last summer, it came with an embarrassing caveat. Sitting in the front of each of the vehicles were human “safety monitors” who stuck out like sore thumbs — contradicting CEO Elon Musk’s promises that the service would hit the road fully driverless. That the silent human employees sat in the front passenger seat, instead of the driver’s, only served to further underscore how Musk had speciously weaseled his way out being true to his word.

Now, over half a year into the service’s launch, Musk insists that Robotaxis will start giving rides in Austin, Texas “with no safety monitor in the car,” he announced on his website X on Thursday. This comes about a month after fans spotted several of the cabs driving around without any occupants, prompting Musk to confirm that fully driverless testing was underway.

But hold your horses and runaway self-driving cars, because this appears to be another bit of deception. The EV blog Electrek reports that instead of supervising from inside the vehicle, it now appears that the safety monitors are simply watching from a car that follows the Robotaxis throughout their entire trips — a Rube Goldberg-style workaround that illustrates the lengths Musk will go to keep up a charade of progress.

According to Electrek, this new operating procedure can be seen in a vlog shared by Tesla enthusiast Joe Tegtmeyer on Thursday, which shows two black Teslas conspicuously tailing the red Robotaxi. Tegtmeyer himself comments on it during the video, calling them a “chase car” that he suspects are there for “validation.”

Tesla has struggled to refine its self-driving technology, including its Robotaxi software. The driverless-but-not-quite-superviserless cabs have already gotten into numerous accidents, have been spotted ignoring speed limits and other traffic laws, on top of instances of driving dangerously or erratically. The human monitors have also been forced to make interventions to prevent a potential accident, and have even at times taken complete control of the vehicles.

Musk once said Tesla was being “paranoid” about Robotaxi safety, and the automaker is clearly caught in a tug of war in which it knows that its tech isn’t ready for primetime, but also has to show some semblance of keeping up with Musk’s promised timelines, which include claiming that the Robotaxi service would have over 1,000 cars in its fleet “within a few months” — it currently only has around 30 — and that over a million self-driving Teslas would be deployed across the US by the end of 2026.

His latest announcement only highlighted that there was “no safety monitor in the car” and made no mention of the tailing vehicles. While you can’t fault Tesla for going the safe route by still supervising its cabs, absurd as its new methods are, it’s clearly misleading its fans and investors into thinking it’s on the pathway to full autonomy. Having an extra vehicle tail every Robotaxi obviously can’t be scaled up if those promised thousands end up roaming cities across the country.

            <p><strong>Futurism | 2026-01-23</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://futurism.com/space/experts-warn-moon-rocket-nasa-heat-shield">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">In less than two weeks, NASA is scheduled to launch its Artemis 2 mission, the first crewed journey to the Moon in over half a century. The Space Launch Rocket has already been rolled out to the launch pad, setting the stage for a historic mission.

While the crew won’t be attempting to land on the lunar surface this time around — that milestone is reserved for Artemis 3 — it’s an extremely ambitious and highly complex mission.

And as CNN reports, some experts aren’t convinced of NASA’s reassurances that the Orion spacecraft that will carry the astronauts is safe to use.

Specifically, NASA has spent years since its successful uncrewed Artemis 1 mission studying how the extreme temperatures during reentry into the Earth’s atmosphere affect Orion’s heat shield.

The Orion capsule sustained major damage after making its return in 2022. It cracked and chipped as a result of the extreme conditions during reentry.

Over two years after the mission concluded, NASA said it had identified the root cause, with engineers determining that the “gases generated inside the heat shield’s ablative outer material called Avcoat were not able to vent and dissipate as expected.”

“This allowed pressure to build up and cracking to occur, causing some charred material to break off in several locations,” the agency wrote in a December 2024 statement.

Yet instead of making major material changes to the heat shield itself after the fact — the Artemis 2 heat shield was assembled and installed even before the Artemis 1 mission — NASA opted to adjust the Artemis 2 mission’s flight path instead, to ensure a gentler reentry.

“Based on the data, we have decided — NASA unanimously and our decision-makers — to move forward with the current Artemis II Orion capsule and heat shield, with a modified entry trajectory,” former NASA administrator Bill Nelson announced at the time.

But not everybody is convinced that the space agency has sufficiently addressed the issue ahead of its first crewed Moon mission.

“What they’re talking about doing is crazy,” former NASA astronaut and heat shield expert Charlie Camarda told CNN.

Camarda has since teamed up with several other NASA research scientists, calling on the agency to heed their warnings.

“We could have solved this problem way back when,” he told the broadcaster. “Instead, they keep kicking the can down the road.”

NASA made changes to the way it applied the special Avcoat material to the Orion capsule from a honeycomb-like structure, as applied during Apollo missions, to larger blocks in order to simplify manufacturing, testing and installing it.

The material is designed to char and erode during “skip reentry,” a maneuver that NASA uses in which the spacecraft skips over the atmosphere like a stone before diving in. However, when it dipped back in during Artemis 1, gases built up below the heat shield, causing it to crack and break off.

The space agency is adamant that its new reentry path for Artemis 2 won’t result in gases building up in a similar manner.

“We won’t go as high on that skip, it’ll just be a loft,” Artemis flight director Rick Henfling told CNN.

Still, Camarda and other former NASA astronauts and engineersare warning that there could still be danger.

“The reason this is such a big deal is that when the heat shield is spalling — or you have big chunks coming off — even if the vehicle isn’t destroyed, you’re right at the point of incipient failure now,” thermal protection materials expert and NASA veteran Dan Rasky told CNN. “It’s like you’re at the edge of the cliff on a foggy day.”

How much of a danger a cracked heat shield poses remains a subject of debate.

“Will the heat shield crack? Yes, it’s going to crack,” former NASA astronaut Danny Olivas, who worked on the heat shield investigation, told CNN.

Nonetheless, Olivas is convinced that NASA did enough. Even if it were to crack, he says, the space agency built in redundancies in the form of several layers of defense below the Avcoat layer that will keep astronauts safe.

“I think in my mind, there’s no flight that ever takes off where you don’t have a lingering doubt,” he added. “But NASA really does understand what they have. They know the importance of the heat shield to crew safety, and I do believe that they’ve done the job.”

NASA’s recently sworn-in administrator, Jared Isaacman, is equally convinced.

“We have modified our reentry profile,” he told CNN affiliate WESH last week. “We have regained margin to safety, and I feel very good about that with Artemis 2.”

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Last year saw the highest vinyl record sales since 1984, signaling a strong desire among music enthusiasts to return to a simpler time of physical media.

Even cassette tapes are making a comeback, with major artists including Billie Eilish and Taylor Swift releasing their material on the iconic plastic, four-inch audio reels.

Now, self-described “party slam” metal band Party Cannon is taking the nostalgia play — often framed as an act of defiance against greedy and AI-slop-infested streaming platforms — to a new level.

The Scottish outfit announced that its new EP, “Subjected to a Partying,” will launch on a Nintendo N64 cartridge. Inventory, however, will be limited to just 100 copies.

“We are going where no slamming death metal band has gone before — Nintendo 64,” the band wrote in a statement posted to Instagram. “That’s right, it’s time to get N or get out.”

“To celebrate Daryl ‘The Frogman’ Boyce’s first release as our new vocalist, we decided to make it something truly special, and there’s nothing more special than a console that’s lifespan ended in 2001,” the band wrote.

The band appears to have touched a nerve, selling out its US inventory of the unique cartridges in less than a day.

It’s not exactly an ideal format for a new music release. Nintendo’s 64 Game Pak can hold up to just 64 megabytes, and the earliest versions were limited to a paltry 12 megabytes. Besides, you’ll need an N64 console and a TV with the right input to play the record.

As a result of those technical limitations, Party Cannon had to get creative, limiting the cartridge release to just four songs, while the full release will feature eight, including live tracks and remixes. However, the ROMs will also feature live video of a recent festival appearance at an era-appropriate resolution of just 320 by 240 pixels.

“Load up your N64 and have an IQ-lowering blast from the past,” reads the band’s tongue-in-cheek description on their website.

The audio quality has also taken a hit, judging by the band’s colorful description.

“[Vocalist] The Frogman sounds like unfettered pressurized sewerage pouring all over these tracks, and we couldn’t be happier with how disgusting these vocals are, it’s a new era of Party Slam,” the band gloated in its announcement.

It’s not the first time the metal band has released its music on an outdated gaming system. Last year, the band released a single on the Sega Genesis cartridge, a 16-bit console that was discontinued in 1999.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Last week, a University of Alaska, Fairbanks undergraduate student was detained by police after ripping off pieces of AI-generated art that were hung up at a student art exhibit — and chewing them up in protest.

As the school’s student newspaper The Sun Star reported, undergraduate student Graham Granger was arrested for criminal mischief after masticating at least 57 of the 160 images that had been carefully arranged by fine arts student Nick Dwyer.

The incident was an eyebrow-raising illustration of the collective exhaustion with being surrounded by the outputs of generative AI, a fierce debate that has gripped the art world. Some, like Dwyer, see it as a powerful tool for self-expression. Others, like Granger, argue it’s quite the opposite, undermining human authorship and taking away from artists who don’t use AI for their work.

Now, in an interview with The Nation, Granger, a film and performing arts major, has spoken out about what motivated him to turn his teeth into weapons against the AI onslaught.

“It’s a protest against the school’s AI policy specifically and it’s performance art because I needed something that would elicit a reaction,” he told the publication. “So this could reach more people.”

It’s unclear which policy Granger was referring to exactly. The University of Alaska’s academic misconduct policy states that “work that is created by an artificial intelligence engine is covered by the student code of conduct.”

“Work submitted for credit that was created by AI-engines can be addressed using the academic misconduct portion of the student code of conduct,” the policy reads.

However, whether arts students are allowed or encouraged to make use of the tech remains unclear.

Granger also revealed that his act wasn’t premeditated, admitting that he didn’t even “know about the exhibit before that day.”

But once he spotted Dwyer’s work, a series of AI-generated images that explore “AI psychosis” and the crafting of false memories, he was appalled at what he saw, particularly when contrasted with other, non-AI art displayed at the exhibit.

“And then I saw the AI piece and it was just — as an artist myself, it was insulting to see something of such little effort alongside all these beautiful pieces in the gallery,” Granger told The Nation. “It shouldn’t be acceptable for this ‘art,’ if you will, to be put alongside these real great pieces.”

“It’s art that takes away from its own substance by not being made by the artist himself,” he argued.

“I think artificial intelligence is a very valuable tool,” Granger said. “I think that it has no place in the arts. It takes away a lot of the human effort that makes art.”

Dwyer appears to have a very different take on the matter. His defaced exhibit was meant to explore his own struggles with “AI psychosis,” a recently-coined term used by health professionals to describe the experience of people experiencing delusional episodes after using AI tools like ChatGPT.

Before they were chewed up by Granger, the pictures depicted Dwyer and his AI chatbot, which he says he fell in love with.

The incident left a bad taste in Dwyer’s mouth — sorry — comparing it in his remarks to The Nation to slashing someone’s tires to protest the oil industry.

However, Dwyer has since decided to drop the charges against Granger, admitting that he’s been trying to rely on generative AI less.

“I’m trying to wean myself off,” he told The Nation.

            <h2>Waymo probed by National Transportation Safety Board over illegal school bus behavior</h2>
            <p><strong>TechCrunch | 2026-01-23</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/23/waymo-probed-by-national-transportation-safety-board-over-illegal-school-bus-behavior/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The National Transportation Safety Board has opened an investigation into Waymo after its robotaxis have been spotted illegally passing stopped school buses numerous times in at least two states.

The NTSB is specifically focusing on the more-than-20 incidences that have occurred in Austin, Texas, it said in a post on X on Friday.

“Investigators will travel to Austin to gather information on a series of incidents in which the automated vehicles failed to stop for loading or unloading students,” the NTSB said in a statement to TechCrunch. A preliminary report is expected within 30 days, and the safety board will publish a more detailed final report in 12 to 24 months.

It’s the first time Waymo has been investigated by the NTSB, but it’s the second investigation launched into Waymo over its school bus problem. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration’s (NHTSA) Office of Defects Investigation opened a similar probe in October.

Waymo also issued a software recall in December to address the problem. But previous software updates have not been enough to stamp it out, and in Austin, Texas — where the bulk of incidents have been captured on camera — the school district has asked the company to suspend operations during pickup and drop-off times.

The new investigation comes as Waymo is in the middle of a rapid expansion around the United States. Just this week, the company started offering a robotaxi service in Miami, adding to its operations in Atlanta, Austin, Los Angeles, Phoenix, and the San Francisco Bay Area.

“We safely navigate thousands of school bus encounters weekly across the United States, and the Waymo Driver is continuously improving. There have been no collisions in the events in question, and we are confident that our safety performance around school buses is superior to human drivers,” Mauricio Peña, Waymo’s chief safety officer, said in a statement to TechCrunch. “We see this as an opportunity to provide the NTSB with transparent insights into our safety-first approach.”

The NTSB is different from the NHTSA in that it is not a federal regulatory agency. It cannot issue fines or penalties. Rather, the safety board usually performs deep investigations to identify root causes of problems in the transportation world. When an investigation is complete, the board often holds hearings and issues non-binding recommendations.

The first notable incident where a Waymo vehicle passed a stopped school bus happened last September in Atlanta, Georgia. The Waymo pulled out of a driveway and crossed perpendicularly in front of the school bus from the bus’ right side. The robotaxi then turned left and proceeded down the street while kids were getting off the bus.

Waymo said at the time that the vehicle was unable to see the stop sign or flashing lights, and has since said that it addressed this particular scenario with a software update.

But as Waymo patched the specific scenario it encountered in Atlanta, some of the company’s vehicles were caught passing stopped school buses in Austin, Texas. Local news outlet KXAN published videos it received from cameras mounted on school buses that showed Waymo vehicles making illegal maneuvers on multiple occasions.

“We continue to engage productively with the Austin Independent School District and applaud their reported success in reducing human-driven violations around school buses from 10,000+ a year,” Peña said.

Sean O’Kane is a reporter who has spent a decade covering the rapidly-evolving business and technology of the transportation industry, including Tesla and the many startups chasing Elon Musk. Most recently, he was a reporter at Bloomberg News where he helped break stories about some of the most notorious EV SPAC flops.

            <h2>The Rippling/Deel corporate spying scandal may have taken another wild turn</h2>
            <p><strong>TechCrunch | 2026-01-23</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/23/the-rippling-deel-corporate-spying-scandal-may-have-taken-another-wild-turn/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The Department of Justice has reportedly opened a criminal investigation into HR and payroll startup Deel over allegations that it hired a corporate spy to leak information on its biggest rival, Rippling, reports The Wall Street Journal.

In an emailed statement to TechCrunch, Deel says that it is “not aware of any investigation. We will always cooperate with the relevant authorities and provide any necessary information in response to valid inquiries.”

Deel’s statement then makes its own allegations against Rippling. It points to its own lawsuit that alleges its rival has been on a “smear campaign,” claiming it’s beating the competitor in the market, and adding, “the truth will win in court.” Rippling declined comment.

This is arguably the biggest drama between two HR startups ever.

To recap, Rippling sued Deel in May, and revised the suit in June, alleging that its rival planted a corporate spy. The Rippling employee was caught in a sting operation and confessed to being a paid spy for Deel in an Irish court via a sworn written statement that reads like a Hollywood movie. The employee testified that he took Rippling’s sales leads, product roadmaps, customer account info, names of superstar employees, whatever was asked for, and handed it over to Deel executives.

Rippling’s suit, which is ongoing, charged its rival with violations of the federal racketeering law (known as the RICO statute and typically used against organized crime) among other laws it cited. But despite using phrases like “criminal syndicate,” this was a civil suit, not a criminal prosecution.

Deel countersuited Rippling, also alleging spying by impersonating a customer, among other claims.

The man who confessed to spying agreed to testify in Rippling’s case, and Rippling agreed to pay him for legal and travel expenses, according to the man’s cooperation agreement released as a court document and seen by TechCrunch. Deel is now calling the man Rippling’s “paid witness.”

But the man also went back to court alleging that his family was living in terror because he believed men from Deel were following him. Deel’s lawyer initially denied this but later discovered that Deel did hire surveillance.

Rippling scored the most recent win, at the end of November, when it obtained bank records. The records indicated that Deel transferred funds into an account held by the wife of Deel’s COO, and 56 seconds later that account transferred the same amount to an account held by the confessed spy.

In the meantime, another court document shows that Deel’s founder and CEO Alexandre Bouaziz, who has been called “the mastermind” of the spying plot in Rippling’s lawsuit, has hired high-powered lawyer William Frentzen to represent him. Frentzen is a partner with Morrison Foerster’s white-collar defense group and was formerly the chief of the corporate and securities fraud unit of the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Northern District of California.

Rippling’s lawyer is none other than Alex Spiro of white-shoe law firm Quinn Emanuel. Spiro is a former prosecutor for the Manhattan District Attorney’s Office who is known for his big personality and long list of celeb clients, ranging from Elon Musk to Jay-Z.

So it’s all sounding like a plot from a John Grisham novel, with a sprinkle of the show “Suits” on top.

None of this has stopped investors from backing Deel or Rippling. In October, Deel announced it hit a $17.3 billion valuation after raising $300 million led by Ribbit Capital and Andreessen Horowitz. Rippling hit a $16.8 billion valuation in May after raising $450 million from investors like Elad Gil, Goldman Sachs Alternatives, and Y Combinator.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">​If you thought 2025 couldn’t get any crazier, the streaming world had one more surprise up its sleeve before the year ended.

Netflix, already the largest streaming platform with over 325 million subscribers, took a bold step by acquiring Warner Bros.’ film and television studios, as well as HBO, HBO Max, and other assets. The deal, announced in early December, will bring together some of the most legendary franchises, such as Game of Thrones, Harry Potter, and DC Comics properties, among others, all under one roof.

​The scale of this megadeal has stunned industry observers. Not only is it historic in its size, but it is also predicted to disrupt Hollywood as we know it.

We’re here to break down exactly what’s happening with the Netflix–WBD deal, including the latest developments, what’s at stake, and what could come next.

​This all started back in October when Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD) revealed it was exploring a potential sale after receiving unsolicited interest from several major players in the industry.

For years, WBD has struggled under the weight of billions of dollars in debt, compounded by declining cable viewership and fierce competition from streaming platforms. These financial pressures forced the company to consider major strategic changes, including selling its entertainment assets to one of its rivals.

​The bidding process quickly became competitive. Several major players saw the potential in acquiring the media giant. Paramount and Comcast emerged as serious contenders, with Paramount initially viewed as the frontrunner.

But ultimately, WBD’s board determined that Netflix’s offer was the most attractive, despite Paramount offering approximately $108 billion in cash. Paramount’s bid aimed to acquire the entire company, while Netflix’s offer focused specifically on the film, television, and streaming assets.

Additionally, Netflix recently amended its agreement to an all-cash offer at $27.75 per WBD share, further reassuring investors and paving the way for the deal to proceed. The deal is valued at approximately $82.7 billion.

Even after Netflix emerged as the preferred buyer, tensions with Paramount remained high, as the rival company continued to pursue Warner Bros.’ assets.

​Paramount persisted in its attempts to acquire WBD for several months. Still, the board repeatedly rejected its offers, citing concerns about Paramount’s heavy debt load and the increased risk associated with its proposal. The board noted that Paramount’s offer would have left the combined company burdened with $87 billion in debt, a risk they were unwilling to take.

Last week, Paramount filed a lawsuit seeking more information about the Netflix deal. The company continues to assert that its offer is far superior.

Given the unprecedented scale and market impact of the deal, regulatory scrutiny is intense and remains a significant obstacle to closing the transaction. Earlier this week, it was reported that Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos is scheduled to testify before a U.S. Senate committee about the deal, a move that highlights just how seriously lawmakers are taking these concerns.

In November, prominent lawmakers — Senators Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders, and Richard Blumenthal —  voiced their concerns to the Justice Department’s Antitrust Division, warning that such a massive merger could have serious consequences for consumers and the industry at large. The senators argue that the merger could give the new media giant excessive market power, enabling it to raise prices for consumers and stifle competition.

Should regulators block the acquisition, Netflix would be obligated to pay a $5.8 billion breakup fee. It remains unclear whether Warner Bros. would remain an independent company or revisit previous acquisition proposals.

​Reactions from the entertainment industry have been largely negative. The Writers Guild of America has been among the most vocal critics, demanding that the merger be blocked on antitrust grounds.

Additionally, insiders worry that the acquisition will squeeze independent creators and diverse voices out of the spotlight, ultimately narrowing the range of stories that get told. There are also widespread concerns about potential job losses and lower wages.

For creators and theaters, uncertainty remains around release windows. Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos has stated that all films planned for theatrical release through Warner Bros. will continue as scheduled. However, he also hinted that, over time, release windows may be shortened, with movies coming to streaming platforms sooner than before.

​What does all this mean if you’re a Netflix or HBO Max subscriber?

Netflix executives have reassured viewers that HBO’s operations will remain largely unchanged in the near term. At this stage, the company says it’s too early to make any definitive announcements about potential bundles or app integration.

Regarding pricing, Sarandos has stated that no immediate changes will occur during the regulatory approval period. However, subscribers should be aware that Netflix has historically raised subscription prices regularly, so price increases are possible once the acquisition is finalized. Netflix tends to hike its rates every year or two.

A WBD stockholder vote is expected around April, with the deal anticipated to close 12 to 18 months after that vote. However, regulatory approvals are still pending, and scrutiny could shape the final outcome.

            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/23/researchers-say-russian-government-hackers-were-behind-attempted-poland-power-outage/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">A failed December effort to bring down parts of Poland’s energy grid was the work of Russian government hackers known for causing past energy disruptions, according to a security research firm that investigated the incident.

Last week, Polish Energy Minister Milosz Motyka told reporters that the attempted cyberattack on December 29 and 30 saw hackers targeting two heat and power plants, as well as trying to disrupt the communication links between renewable installations, such as wind turbines and power distribution operators.

Motyka called the incident the “strongest attack” on Poland’s energy infrastructure in years, with the Polish government blaming Moscow for the attempt. Local media reported that the attacks could have knocked out heat and power for at least half a million homes across the country.

On Friday, cybersecurity firm ESET said it obtained a copy of the destructive malware, which it calls DynoWiper. This type of malware, known as “wiper” malware, is designed to irreversibly destroy data on computers to prevent them from working.

ESET attributed the malware with “medium confidence” to the hacking group known as Sandworm, a unit within Russia’s military intelligence agency GRU, based on a “strong overlap” with its previous research into Sandworm’s past malware, including the group’s use of destructive malware to target Ukraine’s energy sector.

Independent journalist Kim Zetter first reported the news.

As noted by Zetter, the cyberattacks targeting Poland come almost exactly a decade after Sandworm’s first-known cyberattack on Ukraine’s energy infrastructure in 2015, which caused power outages for more than 230,000 homes around Kyiv, the country’s capital. A similar cyberattack hit Ukraine’s energy systems a year later.

Following the attempted hack, Poland’s prime minister, Donald Tusk, said that the country’s cybersecurity defenses worked, and “at no point was critical infrastructure threatened.”

            <div id="article-text">The World Economic Forum’s annual meeting in Davos felt different this year, and not just because Meta and Salesforce took over storefronts on the main promenade. AI dominated the conversation in a way that overshadowed traditional topics like climate change and global poverty, and the CEOs weren’t holding back. There was public criticism of trade policy, warnings about AI bubbles popping, and a lot of talk about what comes next for the industry.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Google Photos will now let you make memes with your own images. On Thursday, Google introduced a new generative AI-powered feature called “Me Meme,” which will allow you to combine a photo template and an image of yourself to generate an image of the meme.

The new feature, which will be first available to U.S.-based users, was originally spotted in development last October by the blog Android Authority. It was formally announced by Google via its Photos Community site on Thursday.

The &quot;Me meme&quot; feature which I spotted back in October 2025 is finally announced by Google. This is an experimental feature which will be available first for users in US only 😐Here is the announcement forum posts- https://t.co/7P2JgJhoBk https://t.co/E60prcqcie pic.twitter.com/sFICxzVIPU

According to Google, the feature is experimental, so generated images “may not perfectly match the original photo.” It suggests uploading well-lit, focused, and front-facing photos to get the best results.

The addition is meant to just be a fun way to explore your photos and experiment with Google’s Gemini AI technology, and specifically Nano Banana. Google’s popular AI image model powers other AI features in the Google Photos app, like the ability to re-create images in new styles, such as cartoons or paintings.

Though a fairly unserious addition, all things considered, these types of features help remind users to return to the Photos app whenever they want to play around with AI tools, rather than going to a competitor’s product.

Plus, users tend to gravitate toward features that show themselves in AI edits, as OpenAI found with its successful launch of the Sora app, which lets you make AI videos that can include yourself and your friends.

“Me Meme” isn’t fully rolled out, so you may not see it in your updated Google Photos app just yet. When available, it will appear under the “Create” tab, Google says. A rep for Google told TechCrunch the feature will reach U.S. iOS and Android users over the “coming weeks.”

To use the feature, you’ll select a template or upload your own, then tap “add photo” and “Generate.” Google notes that more templates are being added over time. After the AI creates the image, you can save the photo, share it on other platforms, or tap “regenerate” to have it re-imagine the image a second time.

            <h2>Chinese Carmakers Are Closing In on America</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-01-23</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/2026/01/china-electric-cars-america/685734/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Two decades ago, a California company called Tesla Motors almost single-handedly created the electric vehicle as we now know it. Elon Musk’s company has dominated the industry across the globe ever since. But last year, for the first time in a long time, the world’s biggest seller of EVs wasn’t Tesla. It was the Chinese auto giant BYD.

The secret to BYD’s success is simple: The company makes high-tech electric and hybrid cars and sells them at incredible prices. The tiny BYD Seagull costs as little as $8,000 in China, and it’s a megahit in several countries. The Chinese car industry—not just BYD but also its many competitors that also make affordable cars—is quickly taking over the world. In Europe, Chinese models make up nearly 10 percent of new-car sales, in large part because they’re typically thousands of dollars cheaper than options from homegrown Volkswagen and Renault. And in Mexico, about 20 percent of new cars are made in China.

But you won’t find the Seagull or any other cheap Chinese models in the United States. The Biden administration levied steep 100 percent tariffs on Chinese EVs and then essentially banned them for reasons of national security. (U.S. officials have said that the cars could transmit sensitive data back to Beijing.) For its part, the Trump administration has continued to keep out Chinese imports and push American-made gas cars instead.

Recently, however, the wall around Chinese cars has started to crack. Earlier this month, in a speech at the Detroit Economic Club, President Trump expressed enthusiasm for letting Chinese automakers build their vehicles in the United States: “If they want to come in and build the plant and hire you and hire your friends and your neighbors, that’s great,” he said. Then, last week, Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney announced that his country would open the door to China’s cheap cars, slashing the tariff rate from 100 percent to just 6 percent. Canada’s car industry is deeply intertwined with America’s; those 100 percent tariffs were enacted in solidarity with Washington. If Chinese imports can gain a foothold in America’s neighbor to the north, then perhaps it is only a matter of time before they do so in the U.S. as well. “It’s the first step,” Dan Hearsch, an auto-industry analyst at the consulting firm AlixPartners, told me. “It’s an inevitability that Americans will buy Chinese cars.”

These developments don’t mean that a Xiaomi YU7 will be in millions of American driveways by the end of this year. But the road map for how Chinese cars could come to the U.S. has never been clearer. The deal to spin off TikTok, finalized just yesterday, proves that any cybersecurity concerns around Chinese EVs are surmountable if policy makers want the cars badly enough. Similar to how TikTok is now run by a U.S. entity, Chinese-designed cars could be manufactured in factories in Michigan or Ohio—even with American-made parts. And today, Reuters reported that the Trump administration has pushed out the Commerce Department official whose office spearheaded the ban on Chinese car tech. (The personnel change “should not be read that deeply into as reflective of broader Administration thinking or decision-making,” Kush Desai, a White House spokesperson, told me in an email.)

The global auto industry seems to think that the floodgates could open. At CES earlier this month, the Chinese auto giant Geely Auto previewed new SUVs and signaled that it might announce a U.S. debut in the next two or three years. (A Geely spokesperson told me in an email that the company “continues to monitor market opportunities in North America.”)

As the rest of the world gets behind the wheel of Chinese cars, it’s hard not to feel like Americans are missing out. And the upside to cheaper cars becomes harder to ignore as the average sticker price for a new car in America hovers around a staggering $50,000. Chinese EVs almost certainly wouldn’t cost $8,000 in the U.S.—especially if they’re made with American labor. But China’s advanced manufacturing techniques, or simply the companies’ desire to price these cars so they can entice buyers to try new brands, mean that they would almost certainly be cheaper than the competition. There is a long history of Americans going for foreign newcomers because they’re the cheaper and more efficient option: Volkswagen, Toyota, Honda, Hyundai, and Kia all got their start in the U.S. that way.

Read: The backlash against car prices is here

China’s automakers don’t always hit home runs right away. Nio, a luxury brand known for its battery-swapping EVs, largely fell flat in Europe with models priced similarly to those from BMW and Mercedes-Benz. But Chinese car companies are good at figuring out what the locals want. Take BYD: The auto giant has debuted a plug-in hybrid station wagon in Europe, a boxy electric micro-car in Japan, and a rugged hybrid truck in Mexico. The cars that Geely showcased at CES, in Las Vegas, were large SUVs with big wheels, opulent interiors, and three rows of seats—not unlike a Ford Explorer. When I saw them, the first thing I thought was that they looked like cars Americans would buy.

Chinese cars built in the U.S. could be a win-win, Hearsch said: Decades ago, when Toyota and Honda came to the U.S., “they created jobs, they brought the manufacturing here, and they raised the overall level of quality through competition.” China’s automakers, he added, “may have a similar effect.” Or at least that’s the rosy view. For the American car industry, competing against China is a terrifying proposition. Not only are Chinese automakers edging out traditional car companies elsewhere in the world, such as in Europe and Latin America, but they’re also what Chinese people now prefer to buy—meaning that Western companies can’t count on the massive profits they once scored in China. Ford’s CEO, Jim Farley, never misses an opportunity to warn of the threat that American automakers now face from China. “They’re really impressive companies, as I have said many times publicly,” he told me in an interview last week. Ford is now preparing some countermeasures. In August, the company announced that it would build a $30,000 electric pickup truck to try to keep up with Chinese automakers.

Efforts like that had better work out if Ford has any hopes of staying relevant. If Chinese EVs arrive here soon, U.S. automakers will have few defenses. The Trump administration spent much of last year rolling back policies meant to boost electric cars. Automakers have been all too happy to double down on what they know how to build, and build profitably: gas-powered cars. Just yesterday, General Motors announced that the revived $30,000 Chevrolet Bolt EV won’t stick around after next year, in order to free up factory space for gas-powered crossovers. Maybe Americans truly prefer gas cars—or maybe the EVs they’ve been offered have simply been too expensive or just not that great. It’s hard to imagine that Americans will want to keep buying $50,000 gas-guzzling SUVs if they have the option of buying high-tech Chinese EVs for half the price.

Read: The American car industry can’t go on like this

All of this could devastate an American auto industry that has already shrunk a lot over the decades. GM was the world’s largest private employer as late as the 1970s, but now its footprint is only a fraction of its former size. And Ford has largely thrown in the towel against Toyota and others on nearly everything but pickup trucks and SUVs. But at the rate the Chinese automakers are moving, even that might not be enough to guarantee a future.</div>

            <div id="article-text">Updated with new questions at 3:30 p.m. ET on January 23, 2026.

In Princeton, New Jersey, a short stroll from the university you have heard of, there lies a little campus home to the Institute for Advanced Study. It was founded in 1930 not to confer degrees nor—God forbid!—to make money, nor even to conduct research toward any end in particular. The institute proclaims that its purpose is “the pursuit of knowledge for its own sake.”

Founder Abraham Flexner reckoned that brilliant minds, once freed to pursue “useless satisfactions,” would stumble upon discoveries of “undreamed-of utility,” as he wrote in a magazine a few years into the institute’s work. It seems to have worked for Albert Einstein, who had an office there. J. Robert Oppenheimer, too.

Enjoy this week’s useless satisfactions. I look forward to your theory of everything the week after.

And by the way, did you know that the United States spent only $10,000 on the last land that it outright purchased? In 1944, the country bought Water Island, 500 volcanic acres in the Caribbean just south of St. Thomas; it had purchased the Virgin Islands (including St. Thomas) from Denmark a few decades earlier.

Water Island was not then owned by Denmark, but rather the Danish East Asiatic Company. By World War II, the United States wanted Water Island too, to support military operations on St. Thomas, so it scooped up the land for a bargain.

This, however, was not the last time the United States tried to purchase land, and not even that decade. Two years after the Water Island purchase, the Truman administration offered Denmark $100 million in gold to buy … Greenland.

How did you do? Come back next week for more questions, and if you think up a great question after reading an Atlantic story—or simply want to share a fact—send it my way at [email protected].

And by the way, did you know that the vaunted Athenians, inventors of democracy, most commonly selected their political officeholders by chance? Bronze tokens representing the adult men of Athens would be slotted into a carved-stone device called the kleroterion, then dice would be repeatedly dropped into the contraption to rule out tokens until only the number required to hold office remained.

The proper poli-sci term for this is sortition, which also applies to how the United States selects people for jury duty today. But imagine the rest of U.S. democracy working like that: You’re tossing out your junk mail when you notice a letter from the feds—congrats, the big government Plinko board has decided you’re serving one year in Congress. Good luck!

And by the way, did you know that—speaking of snow monsters—the U.S. State Department in 1959 issued guidance on yeti expeditions? It informed Americans who wished to hunt for the abominable snowman that they would have to comply with certain rules set by Nepal: They needed to pay for a permit, they had to share any photographic evidence they found, and they were allowed to capture the yeti alive but could kill it only “in an emergency arising out of self defence.”

Alas, this did not mean that State officials believed in the monster. Rather, they were trying to show their support for Nepalese sovereignty—and thus keep the country out of the clutches of a boogeyman that scared Americans even more than the yeti: communism.

And by the way, did you know that throughout the history of the Nobel Prizes, there have been years so turbulent that the Peace Prize committee determined not to confer an award, even as other categories went on?

This happened in a few of the interwar years as Nazi Germany rearmed, Italy invaded Ethiopia, and peace generally disintegrated. It was also the case for the years of World War I, with the exception of 1917, when the committee recognized the Red Cross for its humanitarian aid. (All of the Nobel Prizes were suspended during the early years of World War II.)

The circumstances were a bit different in 1948, when the committee ruled that “there was no suitable living candidate.” The clear message was that the award—which by rule cannot be given posthumously—should have gone to Mahatma Gandhi, assassinated earlier that year.</div>

            <h2>Teenagers Are Pushing Himmler’s Favorite Myth</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-01-23</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/2026/01/agartha-memes-youth-internet-nazi/685718/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Heinrich Himmler and other Third Reich occultists in the 1930s latched onto the strange idea that the Aryan race was not the product of evolution but descended from semidivine beings who left the heavens and established a secret civilization on Earth, possibly beneath Central Asia. Himmler, the head of the SS, was so enthralled by the possibility of what he considered celestial proof of the superiority of the white race that he provided funding for an SS expedition to Tibet in 1938 in the hope of locating his utopia, according to Black Sun, a 2001 history of Nazi occultism by the British historian Nicholas Goodrick-Clarke.

Almost a century later, this idea of a lost Aryan civilization, called Agartha, has caught on again, this time with teenagers posting memes online. If you’re older than 25, you likely missed it. But over the past year, memes about Agartha—a mystical, underground city in the center of the Earth full of flaxen-haired, blue-eyed people—kept going viral and have become a staple of the youth internet. If you search for Agartha on Instagram, you’ll find dozens of videos with view counts in the millions, and many more in the tens of thousands and hundreds of thousands. (Searches for hyperborea and vril, myths that overlap with Agartha, yield similar results.)

Before Christmas, the White House shared a Department of Homeland Security meme that has many of the attributes of the Agartha phenomenon but with a festive theme: Santa in front of a subterranean snowy workshop with Earth’s core in the background, overlaid with the text Christmas After Mass Deportations. Jon Lewis, a researcher at George Washington University’s Program on Extremism who has written about neo-Nazism, told me he saw the image as a clear reference to online Agartha content.

When I asked whether this was an Agartha reference, the White House press office responded by email that “4 people had to Google what Agartha is and we’re still not sure. What are you talking about?” and sent me a GIF of a character from the cartoon Bob’s Burgers, suggesting I was grasping at straws.

I then typed the prompt “show Santa in Agartha looking at his workshop” into ChatGPT, and got an image bearing a resemblance to the one sent out by the administration (on the left below). When I typed the prompt without the words in Agartha, ChatGPT created the image on the right.

Agartha memes usually feature supercuts—a video of short clips—comprising UFOs in the Antarctic, pyramid-laden civilizations, digitally altered images of Charlie Kirk with blond hair and chiseled features, stereotypical Nordic-looking people, and sugar-free Monster Energy drinks in white cans. The memes are almost always set to the same pulsing drum-and-bass electronic dance remix of the 1981 Men at Work song “Down Under.” Others feature the extremely anti-Semitic “happy merchant” depiction of a Jewish person. But all of the Agartha memes share in common the concept of the subterranean Aryan paradise that Himmler yearned for.

Many of the posters pushing the memes are avowedly racist and anti-Semitic. Others are not. The 25-year-old creator of an Agartha memecoin (a cryptocurrency with a fluctuating value that can correspond to a meme’s salience in culture) told me the images resonated with him because he is right-wing and likes “blonde aryan sigma vibes.” He declined to give me his real name, but said he was blond and white, and lives in Europe. (Sigma is a category of memes about successful loners who operate outside the concept of “alpha” and “beta” males.) When I asked him about Agartha’s far-right associations, he said, “I don’t think it’s that deep.” Still others, including a teenager I spoke with who runs an Instagram account that posts Agartha memes, told me that he thinks the memes are funny but not inherently a problem.

Whatever the motivation, the result is the same: Agartha memes and the bigotry they encode are spreading fast.

Agartha was first developed as a mythical fantasy by French writers in the late 1800s but had no far-right associations at the time. After Himmler co-opted Agartha, neo-Nazis carried it and other Third Reich racist myths into the postwar era by creating a new philosophy and value system called “esoteric Hitlerism,” a fusion of racialist ideology and wacky mysticism. In the early 2020s, white supremacists turned those myths into internet propaganda.

The memes have become so pervasive that some people online have started making their own Agartha-like posts to mock white supremacists. Others appear to have simply adopted the style to make their own memes about teachers at their high school or college. (Some are innocuous; some are not.) There are even accounts that post Agartha memes about college and professional football.

I reached out to more than a dozen Agartha social-media accounts. Outside of the Agartha-memecoin creator, only one other, “Westhoughton High Friends of Agartha”—a satirical meme page for a high school in the United Kingdom—responded. The person behind the account told me by direct message that they saw the content merely as “absurd brainrot humour,” and that they “can’t imagine many people take this seriously.” When I noted the Nazi associations of Agartha, they said that “It’s absurd humor 💀” and clarified that they themselves are “extremely left wing” and that they “hate all far right people.”

One way to read that is as a sign of the integration of Agartha content into mainstream culture, where its noxious antecedents are no longer meaningful. Who knows how many people sharing the word Agartha online are aware of its history? How many would care if they were? This sort of transformation has happened before. Pepe the Frog and Wojak (the bald, numb-looking cartoon character used to express ennui) were incubated in extremist circles on the image board 4chan. They eventually became ubiquitous on the wider internet, with little indication of their origins.

But another way to interpret the “Westhoughton High” Agartha account and others that might consider themselves harmless is as a cultural victory for the far right. Even if a viewer doesn’t understand the underlying ideology, the memes can lead to more, and more overt, neo-Nazi dreck.

“Now you have normies playing with what was fringe, esoteric Nazi memes,” George Washington University’s Lewis said. “It just broadened the aperture of people clicking on the video and the sound, who will consume even worse neo-Nazi content.”

The spread of Agartha memes is consistent with broader trends among young people. Recent polling found that 18 percent of 18-to-22-year-olds believe that Jewish people have a “negative” impact on the United States, a level 10 percentage points higher than the response among all age groups. The same poll found that 27 percent of 18-to-22-year-olds agree with the statement that “Jews in the United States have too much power,” compared with 16 percent of all age groups. As my colleague Yair Rosenberg recently wrote, “The research collectively suggests that America is becoming more anti-Semitic because its young people are becoming more anti-Semitic.”

At the same time, the word goy is becoming normalized in youth slang. Goy is a Hebrew and Yiddish term for “gentile,” but 4chan users co-opted it in the 2010s. Posters on the platform often used the term in anti-Semitic ways, such as in the terms goyslop (unhealthy foods that these conspiracy theorists believed were a Jewish plot to hinder gentiles) and goycattle (the unthinking masses who are constantly being manipulated by Jewish people). Like Agartha, such variations of goy have moved from the fringes of the internet in the past year, and posts using the term have accrued millions of views on TikTok and Instagram.

Nick Fuentes, the white-supremacist influencer, has also made a name for himself with anti-Semitic statements, including calling Jewish people a “transnational gang.” After operating on the fringes for years, his content now routinely collects millions of views across social media, and he casts a long shadow of influence over young right-wingers in politics. The ascent of Agartha memes and terms like goy suggests that anti-Semitic ideas now have purchase beyond Fuentes’s fellow travelers.

When I sought out and interacted with Agartha meme accounts, social-media algorithms started directing me to far-right accounts that posted other racist and anti-Semitic content. “What comes with Agartha is its provenance within a racist, anti-Semitic community,” Cody Zoschak, a researcher at the Institute for Strategic Dialogue Global, an anti-extremism think tank, told me. Zoschak, in his research, has observed that whenever he sees an Agartha meme, even from someone who isn’t obviously on the far right, he “can trace a line back to what is almost certainly a neo-Nazi community.”

White supremacists seem to think that this is a win for them. Lewis said that neo-Nazi and white-supremacist groups he monitors were elated after they saw the Trump administration sharing the Christmas Agartha meme: “They would write ‘Hail victory.’”

In November, Martin Sellner, an Austrian ethno-nationalist and prominent figure in far-right European politics, noticed that Agartha was going viral. In a later thread on X, Sellner called the memes a “metaphysical homeland for a ‘lost generation’ of isolated disenfranchised white boys.” Agartha, as depicted in memes, Sellner wrote, “is a place without immigrants, white guilt, a ‘white Wakanda,’ that symbolizes destiny and ancestral ties.” (Sellner added that he tried to make sure any illegal Nazi symbols were removed from Agartha meme examples in his thread, in compliance with German and Austrian law.)

Sellner positioned the memes as something that could be taken in jest. “Irony is the glue that holds this whole meme-universe together. Anyone who takes things deadly seriously or gets triggered has lost,” he wrote. This is the tone that a lot of people online have taken regarding the Agartha memes. No matter the underlying content, you’re not supposed to take the joke seriously, and if you do, the joke’s on you.

Read: The firewall against Nick Fuentes is crumbling

It’s a well-worn tactic, but also a common excuse used to launder noxious content. It’s not ironic or satirical for ethno-nationalists to joke about a mythical ethno-state when that fantasy is reflective of their extreme beliefs.

In November, a teenager set off bombs inside a mosque at a high school in Jakarta, injuring 96 people. The bomber was carrying a toy gun with neo-Nazi references written all over it, including the words For Agartha scrawled across the barrel, according to investigators. The Agartha reference looked like an example of “memetic radicalisation” according to a report from the Global Network on Extremism and Technology. In other words, the bomber may have been inspired by the memes of chaos, nihilism, and wanton destruction he saw online, even if he didn’t fully understand their origin or significance.

“There’s unfortunately no shortage of angry, largely white men who are looking for justifications to commit violence; we’ve seen anti-Semitism be that driver so many times,” Lewis said, recalling several mass shootings in the past decade—Buffalo, Charleston, Pittsburgh—that were carried out by white supremacists who had been at least partially radicalized online.

Nearly everyone posting about Agartha knows it’s not a real place. A certain subset, though, want Agartha to be more than a myth, as Himmler did, and for the United States to be the white ethno-state of their fantasies. Regardless of the politics of any individual poster, that’s the ultimate point—to finally make Agartha real.

In this episode of Galaxy Brain, host Charlie Warzel speaks with the reporter Ryan Broderick about how the internet’s fragmentation of attention and facts has bled into real-world political violence in Minneapolis this month. From the viral spread of a right-wing video about day-care fraud in Minnesota to the aggressive ICE activity in the region that followed, the episode charts how online content routinely shapes government action and public perception.

Broderick, who spent days in Minneapolis after the shooting of Renee Nicole Good, describes what he saw on the ground: how protesters and law enforcement are behaving differently this time around, especially with regard to filming and digital organizing. The conversation explores a novel and concerning feedback loop where what happens online spurs real-world interventions, which then generate more content for audiences elsewhere, compounding division and uncertainty about what’s true.

The following is a transcript of the episode:

Charlie Warzel: Going back to Renee Good, the idea that there was an ICE agent that was filming while involved in this life-or-death—you know, supposedly for him—situation, right? You’re claiming that, but at the same time you’re using your phone to document this.

Ryan Broderick: Yeah, I’ve never had a law-enforcement agent pull up their assumedly personal smartphone and film me. I’ve never seen that—to have them just, like, have a gun in one hand and a phone in the other blew my mind. And I just have to wonder, Where is that content going? Where are those photos and videos going?

Charlie Warzel: I’m Charlie Warzel. Welcome to Galaxy Brain. Around 2015, I started to do a lot of reporting on the ways that the internet was causing a societal rupture. It’s possible, I think, that for Americans—and maybe for everybody—that there’s never been a true shared reality. That we have always been living, in some respect, in filter bubbles of our own making, even before the internet.

But as the world really came online, and as our politics and our culture were uploaded to these social networks that are essentially built for viral advertising, the shreds of our monoculture were consumed by a constellation of content, much of it algorithmically fed to us, and that something changed in that moment. I wrote back in 2017 that it felt like that was the first year—in the first year of the [Donald] Trump presidency—where it just became obvious that Americans were effectively living in two universes, and each one was propped up by their own information ecosystems.

Around that time, too, I was also writing a lot about the ways that technology would continue to blur and make it harder to understand what was real and what wasn’t real. In 2018, I wrote this piece where I spoke to a number of researchers, including a man named Aviv Ovadya. And he specifically warned of this infocalypse, is what he called it—an information apocalypse—basically a future where AI tools and craven hyperpartisan actors on this algorithmic internet that’s completely fragmented and fractured and tech-powered would allow anyone to cast aspersions on any event or anything or any fact. People could just fake anything. And they argued that would eventually create this realm where, to borrow a phrase from the researcher Peter Pomerantsev, nothing is true, and everything is possible.

People, they said, would be radicalized. They’d be overwhelmed. They’d be hopelessly divided, and they’d be sad. But mostly it would get to the state where when you can’t figure out what’s true—when everything is just this information war—that eventually you just start to tune out. And this was all pre-pandemic. It felt very plausible, but the generative AI tools weren’t out yet. They were pretty crude. They were pretty bad.

So there was this feeling that it was plausible, but it still felt so futuristic.

But today, it kind of feels like we’re living in that future. Just in January, just this month, it feels to me—as someone who’s covered this for a long time—that we are living in a pretty straightforward depiction of what the worst-case, post-truth, information-apocalypse scenario was, of the people who were warning about it in the late 2010s. I mean, if you just think about this month, you have X and Grok and this major platform generating and distributing this AI nonconsensual sexual-abuse material. And having it viralized and weaponized to intimidate and harass minors and women. You have a terminally online government. And you have the officials marshaling the resources of the military in service of propaganda to perform for this imagined audience online. And that’s all happened with the U.S.’s military invasion and capture of [Nicolás] Maduro and all the content that has been posted alongside it. You have a YouTuber named Nick Shirley, who at the end of last year posted this video online alleging daycare fraud in Minnesota involving the state’s Somali population. That video exploded online and eventually led to a chain of events that led to the Trump administration deploying a higher level of enforcement of ICE en masse to the Twin Cities. This, of course, culminated in an increased amount of raids and ICE agents in the street in Minneapolis. And, ultimately, in an ICE agent shooting and killing Renee Good in her car. It was captured on video. That video quickly spread online, with people analyzing it from multiple angles There have been tons of protests in the ensuing weeks. So much of that has been captured online. Protesters filming ICE; ICE agents filming protesters. Incredible amounts of content on social networks of people being abducted or arrested or having tear gas deployed on them.

It is this situation where it feels like there’s this battle being fought through everyone’s phone. It feels a bit like a hinge point, and it feels like there is a—despite all of the political issues happening here—that there is a technological issue, that this is all a bit of a culmination of things that I’ve been following for a really long time. Somebody else who’s been following that in some cases alongside me is Ryan Broderick. Ryan Broderick writes the Garbage Day newsletter and is the host of the Panic World podcast. Ryan and I worked together at BuzzFeed during the 2010s for quite a while, covering the ways that the internet changes how we behave politically, and the way that it can impact some of these political movements. Ryan was someone whom BuzzFeed sent to cover all kinds of online and offline protests around the world. He’s been to 22 countries, reported from six continents. And he’s been on the ground for close to a dozen referendums and elections. Ryan recently came back from observing all the protesting in Minneapolis, and he joins me today to talk about what happened in Minnesota, what is happening, and the ways in which all of this can be linked and not linked to an extremely online society. He joins me now.

All right, Ryan Broderick, welcome to Galaxy Brain.

Ryan Broderick: Thank you for having me. I’m so excited. Congrats on becoming a podcaster. I’m really sorry that happened to you.

Warzel: I know. It’s everything I ever wanted—to just be mocked on YouTube and across multiplatforms. It’s lovely.

Broderick: That’s right. It’s about discovering new audiences that hate you. That’s what modern life is.

Warzel: That’s what we’re doing. Man. Well, I appreciate it. I want to talk to you about your reporting. You went to Minneapolis just a few days after an ICE agent killed Renee Good, and you were there for protests around the city and around the federal building. I want to start with—just tell me what it was like to be on the ground in Minneapolis for those few days.

Broderick: It’s very surreal. I’ve definitely come back with a profoundly different take on the seriousness, I would say, of the Trump administration. I think you and I have been having essentially one conversation for a decade. Which is like: How seriously should we be taking this stuff? Is this just like internet chatter, or is this a real existential threat to American democracy? And now that I’ve kind of seen the whole hyper object—you know, from internet content down to what is effectively an occupation of an American city—I think we need to take it very seriously. I’m pretty freaked out.

Warzel: Yeah. So give me a sense of, because you were kind of there in the beginning of this. I mean, things are still going on. There’s still people protesting. This is not a finished movement in terms of the raids in the Twin Cities. But since you were there in the beginning, tell me how you saw it evolve, in terms of both the protesters and ICE’s participation there.

Broderick: Yeah. So, we saw the news come across social that Renee Nicole Good had been killed in Minneapolis. And my producer, Grant, and I—we work on our show Panic World together—so we started talking to our partners on our podcast, which is Courier News. And I was like: “Look, I think this is big. We should do this.” And so we went. Basically, we were there 24 hours after she was killed, and we spent the weekend there. And, you know, if we had had the money and the resources, I’d still be there.

I think it is still unfolding and developing. But the point of our trip was not to—I keep stressing this in everywhere I talk about this—like, our point was not to re-report what people in Minnesota are already covering. They have a great local news scene. But there are specific questions that I think people like you and I ask of events like this, that local news doesn’t have the bandwidth or even the interest in asking, or know. And so it was really useful for me to just follow the action for four or five days and see how this community is using technology, how they’re responding to technology, how the internet is shaping the events on the ground. And I think we did that, but yeah, I think this is going to become just sort of like one of those long political quagmires that happens during Trump administration. Like, it’s just going to drag out.

Warzel: So give me a sense of the level of online-ness of these protests. Give me a sense of how the tech is shaping it. I think for the first, part of the question is: A lot of modern protest movements are very online organized, via social networks and different apps and things like that. This one seems to be, based off of the reporting I saw a little bit. You read that a little bit differently.

Broderick: Yeah. I mean, so—I was trying to think back of what was the last protest that I went to. And I went to a few during 2020. But the last sort of movement like this that I saw close was the Hong Kong democracy movement in 2019. And I was there for what would eventually be—I think no one knew at the time—but it was the last time they protested before China really cracked down. And that was totally online. Like, I watched a completely silent crowd moving in perfect sort of organization using Telegram. Which I was really like, freaky. lLike these Gen Z kids had figured out how to use these messaging apps in a way that I’d never seen before. Minnesota is not like There’s a hashtag, and we’re all spray-painting it around the city, and we’re wearing Guy Fawkes masks and shit. No, none of that. It is people who are, if they’re using apps, they’re using Signal. They’re using a walkie-talkie app; I think there’s a couple that they’re using to organize ICE monitoring. And they’re finding out about protests and demonstrations by just going to them. Like, we interviewed countless people who are like, I was on my way back from work, and I saw this, and I’m mad. So I came by. And we talked to people who’ve never been to a protest before in their lives. Like, you know, we’re talking like middle-aged people who are like, I don’t have any real political thoughts, and this is insane. And I’m going to come out, and I’m going to protest. So it was very different. And to compare that to the other side, which is extremely online, was a total inversion of everything I’ve seen in my career. Like, it really stopped me in my tracks.

Warzel: Let’s talk a little about that. Because something striking that I saw in your reporting, just like coming across on social media as you were like sharing in the moment, was—

Warzel: Well, I always read the posts, but in the moment.

Broderick: No, you just read the Bluesky post. See, I know. I get it. Yeah.

Warzel: I mean, you think I’m gonna pay for a subscription? I mean, come on.

Broderick: No, I wouldn’t. Yeah. Of course.

Warzel: Something that I saw, though, was you were videoing a couple of what seemed to be content creators, like stepping out of ICE vehicles. Or at least government or unmarked government-looking vehicles. Filming, and then like popping back and not addressing themselves. What did you see in terms of creators, influencers who were sort of either deployed by or administration adjacent? Or supported by the administration, you know, in some facets?

Broderick: So the specific incident you’re talking about, with the guy who jumps out of the ICE vehicle. Basically, this woman gets arrested by ICE because she punches their window as they drive by. Like, didn’t damage the window or whatever, if anyone cares. But they jump out of the cars, they pull up, and they just tackle her to the ground. And then right behind them—coming out of the same car—was a guy in plainclothes, like a nice suit. you know, like sunglasses. And he’s smiling, and he’s filming the whole thing.

And I am screaming at him, like, Who are you? Why aren’t you in uniform? Who are you with? Where’s that video going? I later find out that it’s a Fox News correspondent that was on a ride along with ICE. But there was also just like a ton of other right-wing networks that are around. Like, the Daily Wire was filming people. And OAN and NewsNation and all the baddies. There were also a group of YouTubers, livestreamers, content creators that were running around the city, harassing people. And they had a much less official connection to ICE. But obviously whenever they would rile up the crowd, the ICE agents would come out and protect them from the crowd.

And that culminated in last weekend with the leader of that group: Jake Lang, a January 6 insurrectionist. He tried to burn a Quran on the steps of the Minneapolis City Hall. And got his ass beat. And so it’s—that, to me, is much more connected to what we’ve already seen in Trump administrations. Like, the roving gangs of content creators that are just, you know, trying to antagonize leftists and make them look violent on stream. But the fact that ICE was so brutal to the protesters while also basically running defense for these content creators … they weren’t trying to hide it, in the way that you know, police forces were in the 2020 protests.

Warzel: Well, let’s talk a little bit about what you saw from ICE agents. Because there is this element, and I want to get into it in a second, of this content-creation spectacle. But in terms of you saying you came back from this, and it’s very obviously understandable why you would feel this way. Like, I’m freaked out about this. And the seriousness of what’s happening there and what the administration’s doing. But can you just describe for me—and for people, you know, who may not be mainlining this stuff on their phones—what you were seeing from ICE that was so disturbing, or the way that they were treating protesters.

Broderick: They don’t even seem to understand why they’re trying to control the crowd. They don’t, really. I’ve dealt with, you know, antagonistic police forces in protests before. And there’s a rhythm to it. There’s sort of like an assumption that like, If you do this, they won’t really hassle you. And, you know, we can get into the weeds of like how that breaks down as protests become more extreme.

But, like, there’s protocols. ICE does not have that. They don’t really care. They will scream at you. They’ll yell at you. They’ll kind of break kayfabe. They are also filming you. They are, like, very intent on filming you with their cell phones. And with telescopic lenses, that they have guys parked behind them in cars, filming through the window.

Warzel: And that feels very different, right?

Broderick: I’ve never seen that. I’ve never seen that.

Warzel: That’s not something I’ve … even going back to Renee Good, the idea that there was an ICE agent that was filming while involved in this, you know, life-or-death—supposedly for him—situation, right? You’re claiming that, but at the same time you’re using your phone to document this. That feels very unique. That feels like a very different form of, you know, enforcement tactics.

Broderick: Yeah, I’ve never seen it. I’ve never had a law-enforcement agent pull up their assumedly personal smartphone and film me. Like, I’ve never seen that. And I mean, obviously, like there are agencies that do surveillance on protest movements, and it happens. But to have them just, like, have a gun in one hand and a phone in the other blew my mind. And I just have to wonder, Where is that content going? Where are those photos and videos going?

Broderick: Yeah, And so, like the fact that these guys are just taking photos of people and either uploading them to some kind of database or sharing them with each other, like, my mind sort of goes to: Okay, then what? So these guys, let’s say they have dozens of photos and videos of random people in Minneapolis on their phones. Like, are they sending them to each other? Being like, Keep an eye out for this person, and like beat their ass if you see them? I don’t know. We will eventually, at some kind of trial, perhaps find out what these guys are doing on back channel. But yeah. It sort of adds to the idea that these guys are like, I don’t know, content creators first and a Gestapo second. Or something. It’s very surreal, very dystopian.

Warzel: Yeah, and the nonprofessionalization of all of it, right? There is a piece, I believe it was last week, could have been the week before, where a reporter, writing for Slate, applied to work for ICE. Had a military background, but certainly was like somebody who had been hypercritical of the Trump administration and immigration policy, enforcement policies, and ICE in general. And still got hired. The idea of being, like, the threshold is so low. Did it add to the anxiety knowing that you’re dealing with a sort of improvised force? Not only that the guys are out there filming—it seems like they wanna be creating some content—but also just this idea that, again, the standards of training might be totally different. Did that add to the sense of unease, in terms of the protesters and the people who are around?

Broderick: Yeah. I mean, you can’t really predict what they’re going to do. I remember on the Saturday we were there, there’s this massive protest in Minneapolis. Thousands, 5,000 people. Many of them immigrants. Like, many of them with immigrant-rights groups and stuff. And, you know, we’re going through these little side streets in Minneapolis. And I just kept thinking, like, What is stopping Trump from saying on Truth Social, “Hey, get them”?

And Greg Bovino and everybody, like, cordoning off two sides of the street and just kettling everybody? You know, that can happen. Like, the sort of general unease of the whole thing is that you’re not dealing with an accountable, a rational, an identifiable law-enforcement group. You’re dealing with guys in masks that are filming you that don’t really have any kind of protocol. And don’t really seem to care about anything other than quotas.

I read that they’re supposed to be getting, like, 3,000 arrests a day. And the other thing is like: When they do detain you, in a normal situation, a reporter gets apprehended at a protest. You might get thrown in jail for like a few hours; maybe the weekend. You might miss filing your story. And then, you go home. With the ICE detention facilities … like, they might just put you somewhere.

And so, if you’re a reporter, and you’re trying to cover this, they’ve already made filming their activities a possible crime. According to what is NPSM-7. If you film their activity—

Broderick: —they can charge you with terrorism. They can charge you with obstruction.

And there’s really no oversight for what they’re doing. So the risks are just a lot higher than any sort of protest movement I’ve ever seen. Yeah.

Warzel: And I believe, what is it? It’s an NSPM-7, right? National Security Presidential Memorandum 7.

Warzel: Is basically an executive order that is meant to dismantle left-wing terrorism and basically allowing the government to qualify people as “domestic terrorists” or “domestic terrorist organizations,” which allows for different standard of prosecution. And yeah, so that’s adding to all that confusion and chaos. So you saw this. You wrote, “We are all content for ICE.” It’s very clear that the Department of Homeland Security has basically transformed immigration arrests into this visual propaganda online. It’s very clear that there is a strategy here. There is a lot of pressure from the administration to have ICE really active in terms of a media campaign. What purpose do you think it is serving them to do that?

Broderick: I think everyone is trying to answer this question. And this might be an unfulfilling answer, but I think there’s a couple things happening simultaneously. I think, one, I think the Trump administration is full of genuinely xenophobic ideologues that want blood-and-soil nationalism. And they love this stuff. I think that Trump is a creature of the media, and he sort of understands that everything has to have a media component to it. And we’ve seen that … like, I don’t think that he’s playing four-dimensional chess. But I think he understands that everything he does has to have some kind of news cycle attached to feel like it matters for him.

Warzel: Well, I’ll just say: On January 20, which is Tuesday of this week, Donald Trump posts on Truth Social, like, We need more photos of people who we’re arresting in Minneapolis. We need more documentation of just how bad they are. Like it’s very clear that while he’s not playing four-dimensional chess that we know of, he is, as you said, just hyper-aware—

Warzel: —of the idea that this needs to be fed. People need to have this raw meat of “Our nation is under siege” in order to continue to support and to justify this.

Broderick: And I think the last part of this is: I think it is safe to assume that the Trump administration is inside of their own filter bubble. I think this is happening across culture en mass. And I think, based on the reports we have seen coming out of sort of the inner circle—you know, if you want to believe them—they were surprised that people were pissed about this. And I don’t think Trump is actually particularly online. I’ve never thought that. I’m like, I don’t think he knows what 4chan is—but I do think that he has surrounded himself with podcasters and posters. And I think that those people are super tapped into X.

And so, we haven’t actually talked about this dimension of what’s happening in Minneapolis yet, but I think it’s important context. So ICE has been in the state for months. All of this ratchets up after the YouTube documentary by the right-wing influencer Nick Shirley. Nick Shirley’s documentary alleges fraud at day cares in Minnesota. All of it had been reported before. It was even being investigated by the FBI already. Like, we’ve known about this. But the right-wingers who had never heard of this—because they don’t read real newspapers, and don’t have accurate information pipelines—were incensed.

So that, to me, points in the direction of: These people genuinely do not know things. And you can say it’s by design. You can say it’s because they’re all stupid. You can say it’s because they’re addicted to the internet. Could be a combination of the three. But that does inform their behavior. And we’ve seen this all year, all of last year. That they are—the administration is doing things because they see them online.

Warzel: Right. And also, think, too: There’s the other side of this. And you wrote about this. I can’t believe this was also in January, when the United States invaded Venezuela. But, you know, the idea of a content-first administration. But something you wrote—I’m going to quote you to yourself here. Which is always fun, I know. You said, “Politics—and political violence—is now something performed, first and foremost, for an online audience. It almost doesn’t matter what happens IRL if it makes noise online.”

And I think that, you know, that it’s not just what you’re saying—which is that there is this filter bubble. There’s this idea that this is acceptable, right? Like, ltheir whatever, Overton window or whatever you want to call it. Like: This is fine. We can do this. People won’t be mad if we act in this particular way. But there’s also the idea of that imagined audience, that maybe someone sees on X or some other place or whatever. But it’s this idea of almost one-upsmanship. It’s like, you do this video of what’s happening in Minneapolis, supposedly with day cares and Somalian refugees. And we’re going to basically perform fan service by sending a paramilitary force into that town. It seems like that level of the performance is really, really important here.

Broderick: Yeah. So once again—for people who are not like mainlining this stuff all day—and they’re sort of thinking like, okay, Trump too. It’s a little more in your face. It’s got like a fresh new attitude, but it’s like—basically it’s the same idea. And there’s, like, a core loop has changed. Trump: One, he wakes up in the morning; he watches Fox & Friends. He performs the day. He then finds out the next morning how Fox & Friends has, like, digested what he’s done. And he just keeps going. Right. So everything’s kind of performed for this TV channel that is then sort of synthesizing what he’s doing and then influencing what he’s doing.

So the difference, though, between that loop and this one is that the internet is inherently a two-way street. So it’s not just what was sort of downstream in the first administration—like, the internet lights up because Trump does something, because Trump saw it on TV. And then TV lights up, and then TV—like, the role of TV in that equation kind of organizes things in a way. Was like a rhythm, too; there’s a much more sort of reliable rhythm to it.

This is way more chaotic. Because, like, Nick Shirley: He’s making a video based off of what he’s already seeing on the internet. It then goes back into the internet, which then influences what’s happening in reality. Which then influences what’s happening on the internet.

And I was sort of trying to figure out: Okay, when did this this new loop start in earnest? And I think I have it, which is the playbook. The test drive for all of this was Springfield, Ohio, and the conspiracy theory about Haitian immigrants eating cats and dogs in the park.

That whole thing, though, is a perfect illustration of what is now happening everywhere all at once. And it’s happened, and I’ve even seen examples of it happening in Venezuela, happening in Greenland. Like, it’s this roving, kind of, internet-content machine that just sort of lands where you live and then turns everything that’s happening to you into this completely inexplicable content cycle. That, you know, for people on the ground, makes no sense—because it’s not really meant for them. And it comes with conspiracy theories and viral videos and racist memes and AI imagery and paramilitary violence. Like, it’s all kind of part of the same thing.

Warzel: It’s really interesting to think of it as almost like a storm system, that develops outside and just comes to your town. I have had trouble trying to get a sense of who this is helping; who this is hurting. Right? ’Cause on one hand, you have all of this documented evidence of what is essentially a paramilitary force drawing guns, you know, in public places on people. Deploying tear gas and pepper balls and all kinds of, you know, chemical sprays on citizens. Arresting people on whims, intimidating people, mocking them. And there’s obviously, of course, the video of an ICE agent shooting a woman in broad daylight.

And that all adds up, I think, in the eyes of people watching online or wherever. That is doing something right to people, and how they view the country. Their country. And then at the same time, these protests can also—as we’re noting—give the administration a little bit of what it wants, right? It gives them content in order to depict these cities as war zones.

And do you get a sense of if this is, like, serving ICE’s propaganda needs effectively right now? Or if this is in some ways just information that is radicalizing people? To get them to, you know, wake up to the political reality in the United States. Where do you see that balance? Or like, where that’s coming out at the moment?

Broderick: That’s like the million-dollar question, I think. I mean—

Warzel: Right. That’s all we ask here on Galaxy Brain, is the million-dollar questions.

Broderick: Thank you for asking me the most complicated question of our time. I think there’s a couple of ways to think about it. And they are—this is always my cop-out, but I do think in this case, if American monoculture ever did truly exist, we like to imagine it did, you know, pre-Facebook. But maybe it didn’t. Maybe, like, the TV and movies made it feel like it existed, and we could all sort of believe in that. But let’s assume things are different. I think there are vastly different realities happening simultaneously in America. So there are people who are just not going outside, and they are consuming all of this online. And they are being radicalized either for or against it. And that’s, like, one camp.

And then there are the people that it’s happening to directly. The ones I talked to are just the most average Americans you could possibly imagine. And they’re like, This is insanity. And do I have to, like, go to the federal building and blow whistles every day because these people won’t leave me alone? And I’ve met those people, and they are just like the most normal people you can imagine. And they are incensed. They’re furious.

And then I think that there are a lot of Americans who just really do not believe that this could happen to them. And those realities, like, don’t really line up anymore. Because we’re not all looking at the same feed of information. We’re not all looking at the same screen. And it adds to the chaos. It adds to the unpredictability of all this. Because, you know, there are a lot of, like, non-white immigrant Groypers that sit online all day talking about how they love Nick Fuentes and think the Holocaust didn’t happen. What happens when ICE breaks down one of their doors? Right? Like, there are a lot of these keyboard-warrior types who do not imagine this could ever happen to their town. And if it does happen in their town, it’s going to happen to the people who deserve it in their town. And yet, time and time again, for the last year, we’ve seen stories come out, being like: I didn’t think they’d take the good immigrant in my town, that I liked. You know?

And so there are—I don’t think the average American really is prepared for the severity of what’s happened. Like, of when it happens to them. And it is in, I think, the Trump administration’s best interest to flood the zone with images of this stuff. Because it does make it feel abstract. The average person watches and cares until it no longer looks like it could happen to you. And I think that does serve Trump’s interests. If Minneapolis looks like a completely unrecognizable war zone, that’s great. It just means that the person watching goes, Well, that doesn’t look like my backyard. So I should be fine.

Warzel: Mm-hmm. Right. And I was just really struck in your guys’ reporting for Panic World, which came out in a video-podcast form as well—which, people should go watch that. You know, some of the people you interviewed were like—and this has been documented elsewhere as well—the most Minnesota Nice. You know, like just sort of, Yeah, you know, I just came from my shift at school. Or whatever. It’s like when you see that and you feel that there is this way of just being. Like—I think it brings the sort of, it’s a great contrasted image with the paramilitary force. It’s like, anyone who’s drawing guns on this person? Like, we’ve totally lost the plot. It’s not that it’s justified when it happens to people who don’t, you know, maybe look like you. But just this idea of … it’s a strong visual image for people who are watching at home, is what I mean.

Broderick: I think it’s also a self-perpetuating machine. Because—forget who made this point. Maybe it was Wired. I think it was Wired last week, this week. They’re all blending together. But they were basically like: There’s no reason for the Proud Boys to exist anymore, because ICE exists. And so if you’re running … I mean, Trumpism doesn’t really have an ideological center, but if you had to try to define it, you’d say, Okay, it’s like grievance-based. It’s like the Trump supporters hate other people for various reasons, and we’re gonna make a big tent where all your different grievances kind of live in semi-harmony together. And we can hurt others.

And then if you open up a paramilitary force, that requires what? 4Forty-seven days of training to join, and they’re not even gonna like check if you’re a Slate reporter or not. Like, you can just go and hurt other people. And so, in a sense, almost, it almost makes logical sense that this would be the next step for Trumpism. Because you can’t sustain that, like, othering of Americans long-term, without some way to get people to sign up and do it. So it’s almost like we have to create this paramilitary force, and we have to start paying people to do this. Because if we don’t, that energy could dissipate. Or they might just find out that maybe we’re not also different after all.

Warzel: This was something that I was thinking about in different way. And it is a bit of a tangent. But I’ve—as you have been writing about, you know, MAGA influencers, and stuff like screeching online about “civil war” since like 2017 or whatever, right? Like, people who are just like, This is going to lead to some kind of, you know, massive crack-up type thing. T

Then so many people that I’ve talked to who are actually, you know, experts in this type of stuff and in conflicts are like: “You know, part of the reason why terms like civil war are like so unhelpful is because it’s incredibly difficult to imagine in certain places, especially a country as big as the United States, giving structure to a conflict like that.” This idea that’s like, so much of it would just be, you know, weird infighting. Or, you know, acts of almost seemingly random terrorism or whatnot. Right? And the thing that I have found so interesting and scary about the way that the Trump administration is not only using ICE, but the way that they are marketing it, right? This idea of all of this propaganda that’s very clearly aimed at white nationalists. “Defend the homeland” type of stuff.

The reason why I find that so bracing in the moment is that it feels like—and this is sort of, I think, what you’re saying—that it’s giving structure to a conflict, right? It is just sort of like a repository for, if you feel this way, like, about your country being under attack or invasion. Or you’ve been radicalized by some of these platforms to the point where, you know, posting just isn’t doing it for you anymore? Here’s a place to go, right? Sign up. And it becomes less of like—you can see, you know, in a sort of speculative way, this becoming a repository for a very specific type of person. And a force that actually does resemble what some of these militia-like organizations were, right? Except in this case, it has government funding. And, you know, according to both J. D. Vance and Stephen Miller, absolute immunity for your actions. And that feels like it is a completely different, or like a turn of the screw on this concern about infighting in this country.

Broderick: Yeah, no—I think that’s exactly right. If we take the reports at face value that morale is very bad inside of ICE, I do wonder how they deal with that. You know, like you, I’m always sort of saying, like, What’s next? Is this working? Is this not working? And if we say that, okay, those reports are correct. Like ICE agents are miserable. They join ICE. They’re all revved up on white-nationalist Facebook content. And then they hit the streets, and everyone’s like, “Get the fuck out of my city.” Like, “I hate you.”

I mean, I heard the heckling in Minneapolis. And they found out a bunch of their names, and they just kept chanting, So-and-so, quit your job; so-and-so, quit your job. And these people are becoming pariahs. So that, to me, is like, your filter bubble has lied to you. You’ve joined this federal agency for student-loan forgiveness or whatever it is. And now you’re in the middle of Minnesota in the middle of January, and everyone’s screaming that they hate you and spitting at you and stuff. You might quit. And that’s, like, a hopeful version.

And then there’s the scarier version. Which is like: What does the Trump administration do with that? Because we are dealing with like lots and lots of people who are getting revved up on stuff they’re seeing online, who maybe would have joined a militia and LARPed Confederate soldiers in the backyard for the next five years. But now they’re out with guns, and they’re like trying to struggle with the cognitive dissonance of The world online and the world in real life are not the same. You know, what does that do to a paramilitary force like ICE? Like, what is the next step? And I assume you’re right. Which is like: They just start dehumanizing us further and further with internet content.

Warzel: Yeah, I mean, as you’re giving the hopeful version, I’m like: Well, this just absolutely totally rhymes with everything that we have covered over the last, you know, whatever decade on the internet. Where it’s like: Yeah, there is this version in which everyone’s like, Okay, that was a fever dream. Like, whoa, like the cognitive dissonance hits, and you say, Okay, yeah, man, I was just totally wrong. Like, this is awful. This is a terrible way to live. Or what tends to happen online—and again, doesn’t always happen in the real world because there is more friction there—is this idea of doubling down, right? Well, why declare being wrong, when I could just simply make up a reality? Or make up something? Right. Exactly.

I want to ask you to try to put some of this into some context. And I’m going to do the wonderful thing where I quote you again. But I went back, and I read a story. We both used to work at BuzzFeed News. You wrote this back in late 2018. I think it was after [Jair] Bolsonaro won in Brazil. And I believe that you were there on the ground. I’m going to read this, which is you said, quote: “I’ve followed that dark revolution of internet culture ever since. I’ve had the privilege—or deeply strange curse—to chase the growth of global political warfare around the world. In the last four years, I’ve been to 22 countries, six continents, and been on the ground for close to a dozen referendums and elections. I was in London for the U.K.’s nervous breakdown over Brexit, in Barcelona for Catalonia’s failed attempts at a secession from Spain, in Sweden as neo-Nazis tried to march on the country’s largest book fair. And now, I’m in Brazil. But this era of being surprised at what the internet can and will do to us is ending. The damage is done. I’m trying to come to terms with the fact that I’ll probably spend the rest of my career covering the consequences.”

I have a few questions here. And the first is: Do you still feel like you can draw a straight line between all this? That was there, and all that has come after—from COVID to George Floyd to January 6 to Trump 2 to Minneapolis now. Like, did you feel like there’s a straight line here? Did it break off and shift in different directions?

Broderick: With the benefit of hindsight, I think the attitude in 2018 to say this is all because of internet platforms is a little simplistic. I think it’s a little ahistorical.

Looking at the whole picture—or at least the picture up to now—it seems clear that the sort of post–Cold War geopolitical order, this kind of neoliberal end-of-history idea, was deeply alienating and frustrating for people. The concept that we are all kind of done, and we’re just going to get incrementally better in progressive ways. Maybe we’ll have, like, a Republican come in and kind of calm things down, and then we’ll go back and forth. And that idea was extremely frustrating to people. And when social media appeared, it allowed people to communicate without arbiters for the first time.

So you start to see things like the Ron Paul presidential campaign in 2008, which I’ve gone back to several times because things are such a fascinating sort of prototype of everything since. Occupy Wall Street, Arab Spring, the very first Black Lives Matter stuff. And what I think you and I, and other people doing this work, we’re not really totally getting—because of the nature of the way we cover it. Which is not a problem. It’s just that no one can see the whole picture.

Is that like—the technology didn’t really create pathways that weren’t there. What it did was allow us to see them. And so, it’s why I said earlier in the episode that we don’t know if monoculture was as monolithic as we assume it was pre-internet. Could just be that we didn’t know. And so I think there is a straight line from, let’s say, the launch of message boards in the ’90s to now, and Facebook, and everything else along the way.

But it’s not like Facebook conjured up some kind of political environment that wasn’t there. It’s that it gave people like [Rodrigo] Duterte, like [Narendra] Modi, like Bolsonaro, like Trump, like Marine Le Pen—gotta catch them all. All these people, it gave them the ability to speak to an audience that was already alienated and already angry and already bored. And that dovetailed perfectly with the way internet technology has developed in that same timeframe.

So, you know, now we’re at a point where they are essentially the same thing. What is good for the internet is good for your populist far-right movement. And yeah, I think that will sound right. Five more years from now? I think, yeah, I don’t know.

Warzel: Ryan, I thank you for your reporting on this, for being in the pain, the emotional pain cave, the internet brain-damage Thunderdome with me for all these years. And thanks. Thanks for all your insights on this.

Broderick: Hey, I’ll see you in the gulag.

In a recent Atlantic article about Adam Morgan’s new book, A Danger to the Minds of Young Girls, Sophia Stewart poses a choice that many biographers struggle with: “what to do with the boring bits.” This feels like an apt dilemma to invoke while critiquing a book about an editor. Morgan’s subject, Margaret Anderson, was the first person to publish portions of James Joyce’s Ulysses in the United States—and was convicted on obscenity charges as a result. But as Stewart writes, Anderson, who founded The Little Review in 1914, was an editor for less than 10 years, and afterward she lived “the way most people do, somewhat aimlessly.” Because of this, Stewart believes, the biography falls short of its promise; Morgan fails to prove his argument that Anderson’s “greatest work” was “the life she had forged” after leaving her career. Perhaps, she suggests, he should have focused on the editing—and edited out the boring bits.

First, here are four stories from The Atlantic’s Books section:

Morgan’s book is the latest in a series of recent biographies that set out, as Stewart writes, to anoint editors including Malcolm Cowley, Judith Jones, and Bennett Cerf “as the unsung architects of the American literary canon.” The editor-biography I would most recommend is far older than the new crop, and it shows the benefits of a tight focus on the work—rather than the life—of its brilliant subject.

A. Scott Berg begins his 1978 biography, Max Perkins: Editor of Genius, by describing what Perkins, a legendary editor at Scribner, did for his authors: “He helped them structure their books, if help was needed; thought up titles, invented plots; he served as psychoanalyst, lovelorn advisor, marriage counselor, career manager, money-lender. Few editors before him had done so much work on manuscripts, yet he was always faithful to his credo, ‘The Book belongs to the author.’” Following through on this opening, Berg illustrates in minute detail the way Perkins managed to act in all these capacities, turning piles of paper into great American novels such as The Great Gatsby and A Farewell to Arms.

“Are biographers storytellers or annalists?” Stewart asks in her piece. “The best of them combine the two vocations.” Berg certainly does; his manner of focusing wasn’t to pare away information, but instead to dig deep into the archives. Because his subject was surrounded by colorful and often unpredictable characters—alcoholics, neurotics, and blowhards—Perkins’s self-effacing qualities make for a dramatic contrast and a wealth of wild stories. And because Perkins’s work was painstaking, Berg’s research was exhaustive. It took many interviews and manuscript analyses to emerge with a narrative that proves that Perkins didn’t only edit geniuses, but was one. And it’s rarely boring to watch a genius at work.

Berg did one more thing right. The first important choice a biographer must make is the same one an editor confronts: Pick the most promising project. This sometimes means an exciting or popular figure, but it can also mean an enigmatic character whose accomplishments (and associates) compel intense curiosity. Max Perkins, Berg’s first book, won a National Book Award. He went on to write biographies of Charles Lindbergh, Katharine Hepburn, and Woodrow Wilson; all these works were acclaimed, but none was as surprising as his debut.

A Champion of Modernism, in Literature and Life

Margaret C. Anderson was at the center of a notorious literary-obscenity trial. Then she was forgotten.

Some events unfold so quickly, and overturn the status quo so completely, that they seem preordained. The Iranian Revolution of 1979 transformed the country almost overnight into a fundamentalist theocracy. But as Anderson, a war correspondent who has covered conflicts in the Middle East and beyond, shows in this thrilling account, nothing about the final months of the reign of the shah appears settled or inevitable. Drawing on government communiqués and first-person accounts—including that of a cantankerous American diplomat who seems to have witnessed every pivotal moment—Anderson describes a failure that had many fathers: not just the imperious yet indecisive Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, or the ruthless Ayatollah Khomeini, but also the useful idiots who surrounded the cleric, along with President Jimmy Carter’s fractious and communism-obsessed foreign-policy team. A catastrophe that reshaped the world, Anderson suggests, was enabled by people who couldn’t imagine how the world might change.

📚 Beckomberga, by Sara Stridsberg; translated by Deborah Bragan-Turner

“The object of the museum is to acquire power,” announces a crusty old archaeologist in Penelope Fitzgerald’s 1977 satire, The Golden Child. It isn’t a goal he respects. He wants the museum where he’s settled into semiretirement to genuinely devote itself to educating its visitors. Instead, he correctly charges, its curators act like a pack of Gollums, hoarding “the art and treasures of the earth” for their own self-aggrandizement and pleasure.

            <h2>The Sports Conspiracy That’s Too Easy to Believe</h2>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The San Francisco 49ers will not be playing in the Super Bowl, because they lost to the Seattle Seahawks by a disgraceful score of 41 to 6 over the weekend. But of course, “someone wins, someone loses” is never the whole story in sports.

Some fans are now buying into the narrative that the team had no chance because it suffered a suspicious number of devastating injuries over the course of the season (as well as in recent past seasons). Any fan could rattle off a list—quarterback Brock Purdy has dealt with several injuries (coming off a torn UCL a couple of years ago), three key players tore their ACLs this season, and one also tore his MCL. While the team was getting demolished by the Seahawks, tight end Jake Tonges went down with a plantar-fascia injury. To explain this, some fans pointed to the fact that the team’s practice field and stadium are near an electrical substation and suggested that the electromagnetic waves emanating from it could be weakening players’ bodies, making them especially susceptible to soft-tissue injuries such as tendon tears and muscle strains.

“The 49ers absolutely should spend whatever it takes ($20 million?) to move the electrical substation away from their practice facility,” one viral post suggested during the game. Reporters are now asking team leadership about the issue; on Wednesday afternoon, the team’s general manager, John Lynch, said in a press conference that he’s actively looking into the situation. “We’ve been reaching out to anyone and everyone to see Does a study exist?” he said.

To be clear, the concerns are baseless. The United States has thousands of electrical substations; people live near them, and other sports teams practice next to them, too. Some scientists say that you can never totally rule out the possibility that this type of ambient electromagnetic exposure might cause harm, but they have also looked for decades without producing any convincing evidence of such harm. Geoffrey Kabat, an epidemiologist and the author of 2008’s Hyping Health Risks: Environmental Hazards in Daily Life and the Science of Epidemiology, was part of a group of scientists looking for a possible association between electromagnetic-field exposure and breast cancer in the 1990s. They didn’t find any. “We’re dealing with a very weak form of energy,” he told me. There is just no proven way for these weak fields to disrupt human cells, so long as their frequencies stay below the threshold that causes tissue heating (as happens in a microwave).

But fans believe what they believe. They are obligated to live in a state of unceasing anxiety, superstition, and fear of their team being cursed. The power-plant theory is an iteration of that tradition—a movement away from mystical explanations such as the Curse of the Billy Goat and toward shareable deep dives, investigations, and dot-connecting. With all the tools available to them in the digital age (reams of hard data, unlimited multimedia “evidence”), fans can explain their teams’ worst turns of bad luck by composing what can only be called conspiracy theories. Today’s fans will go down YouTube rabbit holes; conduct amateur, open-source investigations; and cut numbers this way and that until they reveal a startling pattern.

This particular theory is emerging during a time when alternative theories of science and medicine are central to American culture—Donald Trump’s EPA has indulged internet-y concern about chemtrails, and we’re back to bickering about conventional wisdom on some of the most basic questions of health and safety, including whether milk ought to be pasteurized. Why not take another look at electricity too, while we’re at it?

The substation theory seems to have been percolating for a while, but it blew up on social media in early January after a holistic-health influencer named Peter Cowan posted a lengthy, scientific-sounding explanation of how “low-frequency electromagnetic fields can degrade collagen, weaken tendons, and cause soft-tissue damage at levels regulators call ‘safe.’” He referred to the 49ers as a “real world case study,” and a faction of 49ers fans latched on. Chase Senior, a popular online commentator within 49ers fandom, shared parts of Cowan’s theory on X (leaving out some of its odder digressions, such as one about the Cold War), and contributed significantly to its spread.

“When it gets to the point where the team is so injured every single season, I think that it is fair to look into anything and everything to try to determine why they’ve been so hurt,” Senior told me. Initially, most people were hostile to the idea. They called him, he said, an “idiot.” Some people still call him that, and theorize that the injuries likely have something to do with the style of the team’s play or its approach to strength and conditioning or stretching and recovery. Many also pointed out that the 49ers are fairly old, as a team, and that they played on short rest a few times this season.

Indeed, the most obvious explanation for the 49ers’ problem is that football is a violent sport. The NFL has an injury epidemic, Matt Maiocco, a 49ers beat reporter for NBC Sports Bay Area, reminded me when I called to ask about the substation theory. “There’s three kinds of football players,” he said. “Guys who have been injured, guys who are already injured, and guys who will be injured.” The team has practiced in the same spot in Santa Clara for decades, he pointed out, and the substation has been there for much of that time. I asked him whether the 49ers really have had particularly bad luck with injuries the past few years. “It feels that way,” he said. “And I think the closer you are to something, the more it feels that way.” (Sports bloggers who crunch the numbers find that they are among the more injured teams—but to reiterate, all football teams are very injured.)

None of these explanations is very compelling to Senior, who has continued bringing the conspiracy theory up online, with increasing defensiveness. He says he noticed a shift during the postseason. “The Niners continued to get hurt,” he said. During the first round of the playoffs, on January 11, the 49ers beat the defending Super Bowl champions, the Philadelphia Eagles. But tight end George Kittle, one of their best players, went down early in the game with a torn Achilles tendon—the type of devastating injury that happens out of nowhere. With that, more fans and commentators grew intrigued, and others started to couch their disapproval of the theory. Even if odds are low that there’s anything to it, is it so hard for someone to check it out?

Some current and former football players have started talking about the substation theory and giving it credibility. The 49ers wide receiver Kendrick Bourne joked about the situation himself after the game against the Eagles. A reporter asked why his team was suffering so many injuries. “Yeah, it’s that power plant,” he said. “Nah, I’m just playing, I don’t know.” He went on with a more typical professional-athlete answer along the lines of how injuries are really unfortunate, but you have to have a next-man-up mentality and keep going, etc.

Now that a pattern has been proposed, it will become only more visible. Each time a 49er is injured, the power plant will come up again (mirroring the endless repeatability of the #DiedSuddenly anti-vaccine conspiracy theory, which was, for a time, invoked whenever someone died unexpectedly). But it also isn’t that serious. The reporter who asked Lynch about the substation seemed embarrassed to be talking about it, and most reasonable people clearly understand that the idea is far-fetched. Some fans are having fun with it and indulging in a little gallows humor to help them get over a disappointing end to their season.

The electromagnetic waves aren’t powerful enough to hurt an NFL player—the real question is whether the story about them is powerful enough to become a durable piece of 49ers lore. When I asked a friend of mine who grew up as a 49ers fan about the substation, she waved it off and proposed an alternative theory for the heartbreaking losses and horrifically timed injuries of the past 10 years. She said that she didn’t know anything about EMFs, but that this was something all true fans believe: The 49ers should never have left Candlestick Park, their beloved old home in San Francisco, where they reigned in their glory days, to go to Levi’s Stadium, their bland, uninspiring new one in Santa Clara, where they have seen nothing but suffering. When they did that, they offended the universe, the Earth, or God. That was serious.</div>

Oh ok, so a Japanese toilet company also happens to make tools necessary for semiconductor production. I guess that&#39;s why these 100-year-old Japanese companies still exist. They&#39;re good at diversification.

> Electrostatic chucks (&quot;e-chucks&quot;) provide the necessary stability and uniform clamping force to ensure accurate alignment and deposition of thin-film layers on glass substrates.

I guess the stocks are no longer in the toilet(s).

Aside from TV show jokes about overly complicated Japanese toilets [youtube.com], I&#39;ve literally never encountered a heated toilet seat actually in use anywhere in the US.  Heated car seats - yes, toilet - no.

Most homes here tend to have some sort of central heat (which I&#39;ve heard is still relatively uncommon in Japan, they tend to use space heaters to heat individual rooms separately), which mostly limits the ass freezing experience of winter toilet use.  And if you do have a bathroom that stays particularly cold, those &quot;handy heater&quot; mini ceramic space heaters that hang directly from an outlet tend to do the trick nicely (with the added benefit of warming the entire bathroom, not just the toilet seat, so you&#39;re not stepping out of the shower into a freezing room).

Heated car seats - yes, toilet - no.I bought a bidet during the Great Toilet Paper Famine of 2020.  It&#39;s more than a basic unit so it needs an electric outlet (for unlimited warm water), so you might as well have a heated seat at that point (and night lighting, both of which are welcome additions).  There are probably more of them out there than you think, people just don&#39;t tend to talk much about toilets.

I guess the AI toilet will recognize my ass and adapt automatically to my preferred water temperature and pressure in the future.

Why call it a 401(k)?   It&#39;s an Individual Retirement Account, aka an IRA.

It is clearly not already authorized by Section 401, subsection (k) of the 1978 version of the Internal Revenue Code.

It sounds like you can get some tax advantages that are specific to 401(k) if you, as a business, decide to do 100% unlimited matching for your you, as the employee, allowing you to get 401(k) advantages but with twice the effective limit.

Something like this. You can contribute. Your employer (you) can contribute a matching amount.

I&#39;ll have to check the details with my accountant. If she hasn&#39;t skipped to The Caymans with my savings account yet.

Nope. IRA has a much lower contribution limit and SEC places tighter regulations on what kind of assets you can hold in your portfolio. You can put practically any kind of investment into an IRA that you&#39;d otherwise have in a retail trading account.

It&#39;s in a bit of a weird place because your employer can contribute a much larger dollar figure into your 401k than you can. But if you&#39;re self-employed, you can do the same.

Most brokerage firms charge employers money for 401k plans, and the better ones aren&#39;t ch

The fact that the person can contribute as both the employer and employee isnâ(TM)t really where the win is.  The win is where the employer is actively trying to provide positive perks for the employee.  Many major tech companies have equally as good 401k provisions (where you can reach the statutory max) because they are trying to provide good perks without increasing salaries.  But at other companies, the 401k can have meager matches with annoying vesting provisions and terrible load funds.

One of many such quirks which are absolutely, definitely not intentional nor contributing to widening the economic class gaps or tax burden shouldered by those with the least.

You forgot South Korea. However Japanese manufacturing and its economy went down the toilet long before the current rise of china or korea. The electronics manufacturers outsourced to Taiwan, Hong kong (while still under british rule) and Indonesia. Now theyre just a sad shadow of themselves.

In Canada, this allowed quota as a percentage of vehicles sold in the country is in the low single digits. It&#39;s symbolic. But... the Canadian auto sector really does not like what it symbolizes. Neither will the US. Right now, Canada makes the cars of other countries - the US, Japan, and Germany. Now, in no way does this mean making Chinese cars is in the cards for Eastern Canada, but the long term chances of that go from zero to not-zero. And given the ongoing destruction of the American relationship, opening the door by just a crack is not a bad idea.

Really only Tesla (reminder to Trump: an American company owned by your friend who benefits from this) will really benefit from the drop in tariffs.  Tesla was importing approximately that many cars per year from China before the tariff. Also they are one of the few companies that can even sell cars in Canada from China because they already meet North American standards.  As for the flood of cheap chinese cars, it&#39;s not going to happen. Canada is way too small a market for Chinese companies to customize the

As for the flood of cheap chinese cars, it&#39;s not going to happen. Canada is way too small a market for Chinese companies to customize their offerings to meet safety crash test standards hereI would not bet on that. In the 50, 60, 70s lots of small European makes managed to sell in the American market, it was not about scale because they were still only doing 3 and 4 digit volumes. If in an era before CAD they could come up with US spec bumpers, different intakes and PCV systems to meet US emissions rules that came on in in the late 60s; BYD can slap whatever Canada needs in terms of bumper height, rear camera, etc and crank out enough parts for CA spec versions of their existing models.Carney

The most important technology product is the solar panel. If we can make that dirt cheap and plentiful, then everything else -- transportation, farming, mining, medical, elderly care, public safety, and robotics will fall into place.

Before the 100% tariff that Canada imposed, almost all Tesla vehicles sold in Canada were manufactured in China, so Tesla was the brand most impacted.  I believe that the new deal for 49,000 will end up allowing a lot of Tesla vehicles, and a few EVs that other existing brands make over in Chinese factories, and we&#39;re not going to see so many BYD vehicles, as I don&#39;t think it&#39;s worth setting up dealerships, etc.  I suppose BYD might create a partnership with another brand for a few years and use those dealerships.  In exchange for the EV deal, China agreed to lower tariffs on canola exports from Canada, which was a big deal for farmers in western Canada.

If China wants larger numbers of EVs, then I suspect the Canadian government will require that BYD or whoever setup a manufacturing plant in Canada as a stipulation.  That&#39;s similar to Japanese manufacturers.

As a Canadian I&#39;d prefer we avoid too many &quot;deals&quot; with China, but the fact is that the North American free trade agreement is probably not going to get renewed this year (even though Canada is the largest buyer of American-made cars and trucks by far), and we need to rapidly expand our trade with countries other than the US because the US has made it clear that they&#39;re going to use trade as leverage to exploit any country that trades with them.  That&#39;s they&#39;re choice, but it means countries are incentivized to diversify away from buying American.

Chinese companies like BYD are lying about exports for a variety of reasons, the majority of which revolve around scamming the CCP out of export incentives or covering up sales deficits to investors.

Why this is happening is anyone&#39;s guess.They probably said something unflattering about Trump - that&#39;s usually it.  I seriously doubt the current administration (or even the next one) is going to change their position on Chinese EVs.

If we go to war with China, we&#39;ll have to rely on companies like Anduril, not Raytheon, to supply our military.

Anduril and other startups focus on engineering systems and weapons that can be built with civilian factories, not highly specialized factories that can&#39;t scale.

BTW, that&#39;s how we won WWII. We didn&#39;t produce systems that were capability-at-any-cost. Engineers had to design systems that could be built at civilian factories because that&#39;s where the scalability has always been.

next time someone tells you this is a free market economy, you know they&#39;re an idiot and a republican ...

It is not clear that we will continue building them at the current pace once the bubble bursts. Also, considering that LLMS are something like 5 orders of magnitude more power hungry than the human brain for equivalent tasks, it seems like there&#39;s a lot of room for improvement in power efficiency. A couple of orders of magnitude more efficient and the power usage becomes pretty negligible. Of course, all of the investment into AI facilities also becomes an obsolete sunk cost that we are pretty much all guar

We already have greatly improved AI chips.Optical Processors like Chinas Tai Chi and Tai Chi II.

They roughly are a million times faster per Watt than conventional GPUs and TPUs.

It is not like EU couldn&#39;t make batteries. For example Finland  has several sand and water batteries. Instead of storing electricity, those batteries store heat. It works extremely well, because there are often windy days during the winter when extra wind power is produced. That electricity is used to heat sand or water which is then distributed later as a heat to the homes.

I think they are using quantum entangled sand so you don&#39;t have to actually move it.

You should nitpick when it makes sense ... and not when it does not.

We are talking about batteries, that store electricity. That was plain obvious, right? Autist?

If you enjoy nitpick, there is also Energy Dome from Italy, CO2 storage that can produce electricity.https://energydome.com/co2-bat... [energydome.com]

But it doesn&#39;t really matter that much do you store energy as electricity or heat in conditions similar to Finland, because heating consumes so much energy and energy demand is much higher during winter. So less (foreign) batteries are needed when heat storage is used.

We are still talking about electricity ... and batteries that store electricity :PHence the fear mongering about China and Raw Earth materials ...

A pile of sand is not imported from China, neither does it intentionally contain raw earth materials.

And in general (there are exceptions), it is not used to revert the heat into electricity again. However that would make sense, if the storage is big enough and hot enough.

I read about a few of those super hot sand storages, might be that was in Finland, too.

A turbine is something completely different than what we use/see as wind mills.Nevertheless no one complains about calling them wind turbines, despite the fact they aren&#39;t any turbines.So, why can you not cope with it, that we have no perfect fitting name, and some prefer to call them wind mill?

What you call a wind turbine, is technically not a turbine.

They extract work from a moving fluid. Theyâ(TM)re turbines.

A turbine has a compression stage, a expansion stage, usually a burning chamber, and the exhaust stage: where the actual energy is extracted. The whole thing is a turbine. Not a single rotor.

A single rotor is a rotor or a fan or a propeller, not a turbine.

That is not the definition of a turbine.Yes it is. Technically speaking even a water wheel is a turbine. You&#39;re talking about gas turbines, which are heat engines that just happen to have a turbine in them.

Yes it is. Technically speaking even a water wheel is a turbine. You&#39;re talking about gas turbines, which are heat engines that just happen to have a turbine in them.

Sorry, then the English usage of the term is different than the German and science usage.

What we put up as wind turbines, are rotors. A gas turbine does not happen to have turbines in it. It has a set of fans. Big difference. The whole thing is set of fans, not a set of turbines.

So &quot;technically&quot; you are wrong. It is just modern habit of speech to call them that. But alas speech/language is changing ...

There is no actual argument other than continuing to create a nationwide reality distortion field.

Renewable energy has to fail, it must, because to acknowledge it means that conservatives would have to implicitly admit that it&#39;s actually economically viable, that climate change might be a teeny bit real, that carbon might actually affect the atmosphere and that the liberals might have actually been right about something and they may have been wrong.

That cannot be allowed to happen no matter what is staring

Rare earths elements are required for magnets in wind power generators,  No they are not. We did not use rare earths for centuries in those magnets.It is just convenient to have them, as that makes the magnets stronger in relation to size/weight and in case of cars the engines more efficient.

I believe China has more than 60% of the production of rare earths elements. Depends on the chemical element. China is leading in refined minerals. But it imports most of the raw materials from Australia and Chile. I wond

Again: it is not required. You can do it without.

Your mine example is mostly about neodymium and dysprosium. Lithium however, they mostly import from Australia and Chile.

Of course you could call it &quot;required&quot; if your whole production process is focused on a certain set of &quot;things&quot; which you settled on long ago, and can not easy shift away from.

The EU has seen declining electricity generation since about 2021, and an end to increasing electricity production as of about 2008.

We need to have harsher and more rehabilitative penalties for violence but not be excessive on petty things which is totally useless, there&#39;s a price society pays when it is excessively cruel.

And how much have the airports and airlines improved?  Apparently its all theatre...

This week, the Department of Justice forged ahead with criminal investigations into Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey—just a few days after Minnesota filed suit against Homeland Security over its surge of federal agents in and around the Twin Cities. State Attorney General Keith Ellison and Hennepin County Attorney Mary Moriarty are also being roped in and face subpoenas. The federal government is considering whether to charge Minnesota officials with conspiracy to impede federal agents’ immigration enforcement duties, but the case is clearly doomed to the same failure that met President Donald Trump’s efforts to prosecute political adversaries New York Attorney General Letitia James and former FBI Director James Comey. While those cases fell on technicalities, the investigations of the Minneapolis officials look likely to topple on more straightforward grounds: An administration that postures as fierce defenders of First Amendment rights is targeting these officials purely for their speech. While this effort is destined to fail, it still has the power to inflict long-term damage.

“The government may not take action based on the viewpoint of the speaker. Period, full stop,” former U.S. Attorney and Deputy Assistant Attorney General Harry Litman explained to Slate. Litman hosts the Talking Feds podcast, and he explained that the DOJ appears to be going after Walz and Frey through a federal statute that makes it a crime for local officials to conspire to prevent, force, intimidate, or threaten an officer who is required to perform their duties.

In order to prove Walz and Frey conspired against federal agents, the DOJ is likely going to attempt to use their public comments against them. For instance, Walz called the deployment of federal agents in Minnesota “sensationalized operations” and also put out a public statement urging people to “speak out loudly, urgently, but also peacefully.” Frey, during a separate press conference, made national waves when he said, “To ICE: Get the fuck out of Minneapolis. We do not want you here.”

To almost anyone hearing those comments, Walz’s and Frey’s statements would not amount to a “conspiracy.” The obvious reality is that the Trump administration simply has beef with the public statements Walz and Frey have made and is trying to intimidate them and any other critics of ICE’s brutal—arguably murderous—recent tactics.

The issue for the DOJ in this case is that these statements don’t clear the bar of the federal statute it’s trying to invoke. “It has to be an agreement to use force, threat, or intimidation to impede federal officials,” Litman explained, and those threats have to produce imminent lawless action—known as the Brandenburg standard. Previous Supreme Court jurisprudence has confirmed this, with the court ruling that even speech where someone is calling for unlawful action is protected under the First Amendment, until and unless it actually results in a tangible crime. “The basic idea is that the First Amendment line is really robust and really extensive and it stops at the point, but only at the point, where some really bad shit is just about to go down because of your words,” Litman explained.

Another problematic element to the DOJ’s strategy is the fact that they have issued subpoenas to the state attorney general and the local prosecutor, both of whom have pledged to look into investigating Jonathan Ross, the ICE officer who shot and killed Renee Good. Litman said it’s highly irregular to subpoena a prosecutor, and particularly problematic in this instance when the federal statute the DOJ is using to investigate may not hold up to scrutiny in court. On top of that, grand jury rules dictate that prosecutors cannot just hand out subpoenas in order to dig around for new information or to harass someone; they must be in pursuit of a legitimate crime.

To Litman, the bottom line is that the president is clearly using the threat of criminal prosecution to further threaten our constitutional democracy. As he told me, the message to local officials across the country who are already experiencing federal agents in their cities and to those who may be next is: “If you argue with me politically, I’ll see your ass in court—and maybe in jail.”

This week, President Donald Trump suffered a string of defeats that exposed the real limits of his power at home and abroad. First, his Justice Department abandoned its efforts to illegally appoint Lindsey Halligan, his former personal lawyer, as U.S. attorney, yielding to a furious judicial rebuke of its dirty tactics. Then the president dropped his threat to seize Greenland through military force or ruinous tariffs in the face of stiff international resistance. At almost the same time, the Supreme Court threw cold water on his bid to fire Lisa Cook from the Federal Reserve. Meanwhile, Minneapolis residents continue to protest, thwart, and document his violent assault on immigrant communities.

On this week’s Slate Plus bonus episode of Amicus, co-hosts Dahlia Lithwick and Mark Joseph Stern discussed the vital lessons to be gleaned from these victories against the president’s abuses of power. A preview of their conversation, below, has been edited and condensed for clarity.

Dahlia Lithwick: This story feels symbolic of the theme we wanted to talk about this week, which is that sometimes standing up to Trump really works. In November, a federal judge ruled that the Trump administration had illegally installed Lindsey Halligan as interim U.S. attorney in Virginia and threw out her sloppy indictments of James Comey and Letitia James. But somehow Halligan refused to leave the office and kept claiming the title. When a different judge, David Novak, told her to stop, she filed this seething reply, with full backing from Pam Bondi’s DOJ, calling him a partisan hack. Tell us how he responded this week.

Mark Joseph Stern: This was one of the most incandescent judicial opinions I think I have ever seen. And, by the way, this is a Trump appointee; he’s not a flaming liberal. But Novak accused Halligan of wildly unprofessional conduct and openly breaking the law. This was a master class in dressing down the class clown. He wrote that her brief “contains a level of vitriol more appropriate for a cable news talk show and falls far beneath the level of advocacy expected from litigants in this Court, particularly the Department of Justice.”

Novak also pointed out that the chief judge of the 4th Circuit has made the ruling against Halligan’s appointment binding across the district, so Halligan was “simply flouting a judicial order because of a disagreement” by pretending to still hold the office. He wrote: “Ms. Halligan’s response asserts that she is free to act in an unlawful capacity, because she disagrees that she does so unlawfully. But that’s not how our legal system works.” And he went on: “The Eastern District of Virginia has long enjoyed the service of experienced prosecutors” who “shared an unwavering commitment to the Rule of Law, putting the interests of the citizens of the District before their own personal ambitions, as true public servants do. Unfortunately, it appears that this ethos has come to an end.”

Obviously, Novak was not backing down. He struck Halligan’s title as U.S. attorney from all relevant filings. And he said that while professional discipline—including potential disbarment—would have been appropriate, he would give Halligan “the benefit of the doubt” because of her unusual “inexperience” as a prosecutor. That was an extraordinary way to say: You are so unprofessional and inexperienced that I’m not even going to discipline you because you never had any business in this position in the first place.

The really important thing here is that, in a world in which these folks act as though they have boundless impunity to do what they want, it is incredibly important for judges to say no. It’s the cornerstone of how we think about the judicial role. That said, I have to read one more smackdown. Novak wrote: “No matter all of her machinations, Ms. Halligan has no legal basis to represent to this court that she holds the position. … This charade of Ms. Halligan masquerading as the United States Attorney for this District in direct defiance of binding court orders must come to an end.”

This is a historic dressing-down of somebody who thought they were made of Teflon. A few months ago, Halligan was asserting that she had the power to jail the president’s political foes on a pretext. And this humiliation is compounded by the fact that the chief judge of the district court posted a notice on Tuesday that the position of U.S. attorney was vacant—because even if Halligan had been appointed legally, her 120 days in the office were officially up. How did Halligan react to these slights?

She gave up, which is not what I expected. It was entirely possible that the Trump administration would attempt to reappoint her as interim U.S. attorney for another 120 days and try to fight this out till the end. Instead, it surrendered. Bondi announced on social media that Halligan would no longer seek to serve in the position. That is a victory for all the judges who stood up to this unlawful appointment. And it took me by surprise because the Justice Department’s filing earlier sounded like the opening salvo of a major battle over the limits of a president’s power to install his crony as top prosecutor. Then, when the DOJ got shot down and embarrassed and threatened with actual consequences, it just tucked in its tail and limped away.

There’s another topic I want to discuss in this same key. As late as Tuesday, America’s allies seem to be gearing up for a full-on confrontation with Trump over his deranged quest to seize Greenland. Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney gave a stem-winder of a speech at Davos promising to defend Greenland’s sovereignty and bemoaning Trump’s “rupture” of the rules-based international order. Then, on Wednesday, in the face of all this, Trump just rolled over and gave up?

He conceded defeat. He said he was not going to use military force to seize Greenland, which was the threat that he had been pushing for days—tanking the markets, terrifying the allies, forcing Denmark and Greenland to prepare for possible battle with the United States. He just said: Never mind, I’m not going to do that. Then he purported to secure a deal with NATO that would give the U.S. unlimited access to Greenland, something we already have under current agreements. So he didn’t do anything at all. He imperiled the entire world order to end up with the status quo.

When Carney gave that speech, and world leaders gave him a standing ovation, I was worried. I wondered: Is this the provocation? Is this the moment we truly become a rogue nation? Are the tanks going to be rolling into Greenland? And instead, Trump gave up, just as he did with Halligan. The truth is that he’s weak. He is not the muscular president he pretends to be on television. When someone says no, and uses tools at their disposal to enforce that boundary, he stands down, because he is terrified of being defeated in a way that he can’t spin as a secret victory.

That’s particularly salient in a week when so many horrors have befallen residents of Minnesota who are standing up to genuine tyranny. It may be tempting to slide into defeatism. But your point is that Donald Trump is a cartoon strongman’s idea of a strongman, right? He’s not actually very strong. If people and institutions and businesses and government stand up to him, he crumples.

Let’s braid into that a conversation we had earlier in the week about the Supreme Court arguments over Trump’s attempt to fire Lisa Cook from the Federal Reserve. The justices were like: What? You can’t do this. We can’t have the Fed at the mercy of a president who goes on pretextual fishing expeditions to go after people he doesn’t like. The point here seems to be: Don’t cede all this power to him. And maybe if SCOTUS would grow a spine, this could end tomorrow.

You observed on Wednesday that a lot of the justices sounded pissed. They were like: How did we get to this point? And it’s their own fault! They gave Trump so much leeway in all of these earlier cases to break the law. Then they seemed irked when he crossed the line that they had tried to draw in the sand over the Federal Reserve. They seemed to wonder: How could this happen? Well, look in the mirror. When you capitulate, you empower Trump to push further past your limits. That’s the lesson that the international community seems to have learned, and that our more courageous judges in the lower courts have learned. Let’s just hope that John Roberts, Brett Kavanaugh, and Amy Coney Barrett are learning it now, because it’s one of the few things that could turn around this catastrophe.

With Trump, you’ve got to hold the line, or else you just get bowled over. That is what everyone out in the streets in Minnesota is doing right now, and we are seeing the results. The average protester blowing a whistle on the streets of the Twin Cities has shown more courage than John Roberts has in maybe his entire career.

It’s remarkable how many times Donald Trump acts like Donald Trump, and people come away dazed and stupefied, as if they haven’t witnessed the spectacle over and over before.

It happened again this week at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. In his speech on Wednesday, our president doubled down on his odd obsession over Greenland, demanding U.S. ownership of the icy island, insisting that he needs it for national security, and telling European leaders, in the pose of a Mafia don, “You can say yes and we will be very appreciative, or you can say no and we will remember.”

Trump had threatened, a few days earlier, to impose 100 percent tariffs on European nations that opposed his takeover plans. It seemed, this time, he wasn’t going to back down from his own ruinous demands.

And then he backed down. Just a few hours after his speech, which was unusually hostile by even his standards, he emerged from a meeting with NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte, announced that they’d worked out the “framework of a future deal” on Greenland, so there’d be no need for an invasion or for any punitive tariffs. Asked about the details of this framework, Trump said, “We’ll have something in two weeks”—his usual timetable for putting off important decisions, or sometimes evading them altogether.

In other words, Trump the Godfather had once again transformed into the TACO Man—the derisive acronym for “Trump Always Chickens Out,” coined after the first couple of times he threatened tariffs, then backed off, early on in his second term as president.

But this time, the syndrome played out differently. The targets of the threat, in this case the leaders of European nations, were in the same room, watching in real time. They’d gathered earlier, to work out a unified stance, and they were energized by one of their own, Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney, whose speech, the day before Trump’s, laid out a clear path for how medium-sized countries, working together, can outmaneuver the dictates of large powers that abuse the rules they created for their own benefit. (Carney is no starry-eyed idealist, having once been the head of the Bank of England and the Bank of Canada.)

In short, the Europeans did something that Trump, with some reason, thought they would never do—they held firm. They threatened to invoke the Anti-Coercion Instrument (nicknamed “the Bazooka”), which allows the European Union to counter economic pressure from third nations with tariffs and penalties of its own. The bazooka was designed as a deterrent—and it seems to have deterred. It was a major reason why Trump backed down. The financial markets’ response to Trump’s speech probably also played a role; the S&P 500 plunged 2.5 percent, some bankers worried about a run on the dollar and a sell-off of Treasury notes. (The stock market recovered its losses, and financiers’ panic abated, after the president chickened out.)

Many European leaders—and probably some of Trump’s aides too—heaved a huge sigh of relief. For all the wishful talk of “strategic autonomy,” at least by some EU members, they prefer mutually productive relations with the United States. The dollar still reigns supreme in global transactions, and a reliable U.S. military presence is crucial to Europe’s security, at least for the next decade.

Yet under Trump, relations with the U.S.—for not just the Europeans but all of America’s traditional allies—are neither productive nor reliable. And his backpedaling on Greenland, while welcome, doesn’t alter this clear reality. In fact, in some ways, it intensifies the pervasive aura of insecurity. Trump came to Davos so insistent in his belligerence, so determined to pursue U.S. interests as he saw them (however misguided he was about what those interests really were)—then, within hours, shifted 180 degrees with no explanation and only the vaguest outline of an alternative plan. How, from now on, can anyone take seriously any threat or promise Trump makes? He is still, by default, the leader of the free world and, by constitutional powers, the commander in chief of the world’s most lethal military establishment—yet how can anyone rely on anything he says?

We have been creeping, for some time now, toward this crisis (crisis is not too strong a word for what we’re facing), but the summit in Davos dramatized it. It did so in two ways. First, Trump’s speech was so hostile and his subsequent retreat was so airheaded. (No one could convincingly claim, as some have in the wake of previous reversals, that Trump was playing some wizard’s game of four-dimensional chess.) Second, and more important, the leading allies publicly talked about his behavior and found in Carney’s speech—which they greeted with (a rarity at Davos) a roused standing ovation—a way of moving out of the old order’s grip.

It’s unclear whether they’ll be able to sustain this pivot toward a “third way.” The United States still has, as Trump likes to put it, lots of “cards” to play in tit-for-tat games of leverage. Still, the landscape is changing. China is exploiting the trans-Atlantic transition (or, as Carney described it, the “rupture”), moving into markets that had previously been closed; even before his Davos speech, Carney signed a high-profile trade deal with Beijing. The EU negotiated a similar deal with South American nations, similarly designed to bypass Washington’s control. Denmark announced that it would sell its stockpile of U.S. Treasury notes, valued at $100 million, at the end of the month. This isn’t as much as it may seem; the EU holds about $10 trillion in U.S. assets. Still, it’s an unusual gesture fraught with at least symbolic significance.

Trump has responded to the growing discontent with dismissive contempt. In his Davos speech, he bellowed that, without the United States, much of the world “wouldn’t be making anything”; that without his own efforts, “you wouldn’t have NATO,” which gives us “absolutely nothing” in return; and that if America hadn’t entered World War II, “you’d all be speaking German”—a bizarrely crude thing to say in Switzerland, where the most commonly spoken official language is German.

Yes, the U.S. holds a lot of cards. But Trump doesn’t realize that the game is changing and that, under the emerging set of new rules, his cards are slowly but steadily declining in value.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">This is part of a series of on-the-ground reports from Minneapolis.

Over the past few weeks, previously unthinkable horrors have unfolded in Minnesota as federal agents working for Immigration and Customs Enforcement have shot Renee Nicole Good in the head, killing her, and arrested a 5-year-old boy just as he was arriving home from school. Erin Maye Quade is a Minnesota state senator who has now witnessed countless instances of federal agents arresting and detaining her constituents. This week, Maye Quade decided it was time to put out a blunt warning for the rest of America in the form of a TikTok video: “There may be people outside of Minnesota who are thinking: When this comes to my state, I’m white, or a U.S. citizen, or I live in a suburb or rural area, or a neighborhood with few or no immigrants, and this is something I won’t experience or see,” the senator said. “I’m here to dispel that myth for you. That is not the case.”

Maye Quade, who lives in the Minneapolis suburb of Apple Valley, emphasized just how ubiquitous immigration enforcement has become across rural, suburban, and urban Minnesota. ICE presence is so large it surpasses the number of local law enforcement members in the state’s 10 largest metro areas combined. These agents are not working from an organized list of known immigrants living in the U.S. unlawfully, let alone a judicial warrant; instead they are operating at random. Maye Quade says she’s observed agents just driving around her town “looking for kidnappings of opportunity,” which she described as agents idling their cars and simply waiting for Black, brown, or Asian Americans to walk by, as they take out the trash, walk their dog, or run into a gas station. “They will swarm that person, kidnap them, and take them away.”

Maye Quade realized she should use what she has witnessed to warn her colleagues in other states, along with friends and family who don’t live in Minnesota. Her video has garnered more than 3 million views. “It sounds like a wartime diary,” Maye Quade said in an interview with Slate, but it wasn’t only that the senator gave a no-frills, boots-on-the-ground perspective that drew so much attention to her video. It was the fact that she simultaneously was offering advice on how to deal with federal immigration agents when they come to your town.

Two days after Maye Quade posted her TikTok, the Department of Homeland Security announced it had launched “Operation Catch of the Day” in Maine, the latest state to face an onslaught of federal agents. I asked Maye Quade what advice she would give residents there and across the country as they begin to deal with federal immigration agents.

“The first thing is to either put together your constitutional observer training now, or reach out to folks in Minnesota to get that training.”

That’s a reference to the Handbook for Constitutional Observers, a project by the advocacy groups Immigrant Defense Network and COPAL. It was created in response to Donald Trump’s second term in office and offers guidelines on how to legally observe and document law enforcement interactions and inform people about their civil rights and due process. Francisco Segovia, executive director of COPAL, explained that this training is specifically designed for folks who are not directly impacted by the Trump administration’s immigration enforcement, but who can still participate in helping educate people about their constitutional rights.

In Minnesota, Maye Quade explained that communities organized themselves by zones or regions, and established Signal chats to communicate about federal immigration activity. Participants were each assigned a role; some were in charge of vetting people who want to join the group, while others were assigned to commute around the community and report on any immigration enforcement activity. Local mutual aid networks were also stood up to ensure those impacted by federal agents’ immigration enforcement actions had food, medicine, rides to work and school, and safety patrols around them.

“DOPA forms—delegation of parental authority.”

This is a document that gives someone authority to take care of a child when their parents or guardians cannot, for up to one year. The designated adult can make decisions about a child’s care, custody, and medical treatment, but it does not give permission for adoption or marriage. The DOPA form does not take away a parent or guardian’s ability to make decisions for their child. Having this prepared in advance can ensure a child is taken care of in a worst-case scenario, as Maye Quade recounted instances of parents shouting out the names of their children and their school while being arrested by federal agents in hopes that someone will help them.

“Have whistles with you in your car and keep your cellphone charged.”

Maye Quade reaffirmed that it is not illegal to record a federal agent. However, if you do happen to encounter an arrest, it’s important to understand that agents don’t usually differentiate between protestors and observers. Anyone who happens to be around can be targeted, with the senator emphasizing that you should close your car vents and turn off the heat in case you are pepper-sprayed or tear-gassed. It’s also a good idea to keep water or saline spray with you, as both can help remove pepper spray from the eyes.

“Businesses should get very familiar with what their legal rights are.”

Businesses should understand when they have the legal authority to keep people off their private property and how they can enforce a code of conduct. Maye Quade also suggested businesses be prepared for an I-9 audit, when federal agents inspect whether a business has confirmed their workers’ identities and work authorizations. This process does not require a warrant, but agents have to give employers at least three days’ notice.

Here, Maye Quade also emphasized that businesses should become familiar with federal agents’ tactics. In one case, “they used a ruse of a pretend car crash in the parking lot to lure a day care worker out of her house,” she said, while in other instances federal agents have asked passersby for help outside businesses only to arrest them instead.

“The people that are being taken are like us.”

Despite the Trump administration’s insistence that federal agents are targeting “the worst of the worst,” immigrants who have committed crimes or are in the U.S. without permanent legal status, that is not what Maye Quade has witnessed in Minnesota. U.S. citizens, lawful permanent residents, and people who have been legally admitted into the country are all being targeted right now. “It’s literally just anyone who’s Black, brown, or Asian. Most of them have status and have broken no law,” she said.

            <h2>ICE Agents Detained Me for Eight Hours for Legally Observing Them. I Saw Exactly What They’re Up To.</h2>
            <p><strong>News and Politics - Slate Magazine | 2026-01-23</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2026/01/arrested-for-observing-ice-minnesota-lesson.html?via=rss">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">This is part of a series of on-the-ground reports from Minneapolis.

As masked men dressed for war surrounded the car my friend Patty and I sat in, all I could think about were the moments that had led to my neighbor Renee Good’s death. “I’m not mad at you,” she had told her killer. These agents, who I had to assume were from Immigration and Customs Enforcement (they never identified themselves), were already banging on our windows and recording us. Then they pepper-sprayed the intake vent of the car. They were definitely mad at us.

“You’re under arrest!” the agents yelled. Terrified, I thrust my hands in the air and waited for instruction. They did not give me any—instead, they shattered our windows and pulled me out. I was roughly handcuffed and shoved into the back of an unmarked Subaru.

I was a recent volunteer to the neighborhood group that had organized to observe and report ICE after Operation Metro Surge began here in Minnesota weeks ago. The efforts had only increased since Good’s killing. In community chats, suspected ICE sightings are reported, their license plates checked against a constantly updated public spreadsheet. If they are confirmed, people in cars drive to the scene to record what the agents are doing and warn people that ICE is in the area with car horns and whistles. Recording, a legally protected action, occurs on public streets.

Most of the time, commuting (as it’s known in activist circles) is boring. You typically drive in circles around familiar streets. Volunteer dispatchers will help coordinate where people should go, but usually they just recommend sticking around areas with lots of brown people: restaurants, community centers, the kinds of places that make Minneapolis vital. Commuting has become so popular as of late that it’s common to hear a dispatcher request that listeners “please leave the call if you are not actively commuting.” Signal calls have limited space.

Occasionally, though, commuting is terrifying. “Have y’all not learned?” an agent provocatively asks a legal observer in a video that’s been circulating among volunteers, two days after Good was killed. Her response, “What’s our lesson here?,” angers him, and he tries to snatch her phone. Agents have also been known to follow commuters to their homes to intimidate them, which means “He’s following me to my house” has become another common refrain on the Signal chat. One time, I suggested that a woman on a call drive to a nearby gas station to meet me because an ICE vehicle was idling outside her home and she was audibly terrified.

I ended up in ICE custody shortly after beginning a commute on Jan. 11. Someone in our neighborhood chat had reported that ICE vehicles were pepper-spraying an observer. Patty and I, not far away, drove there. I was keenly aware of Good’s death when we arrived on the scene—it had been just four days and was a six-minute drive from where she was killed. This was the first time I had ever seen ICE agents in my life (I wasn’t joking when I said some commuter shifts are boring), and that’s when they pepper-sprayed the interior of our car and hauled us out of it. By the time the agents shoved me into that unmarked SUV, three minutes and 30 seconds had elapsed. We didn’t understand why we were being taken in: We hadn’t blocked their cars or done anything beyond routine observing.

Patty, separated from me, was subject to humiliation on her drive in. They called her ugly, took pictures of her, and referred to Renee Good as “that lesbian bitch.” They took us both to the Whipple Federal Building, a place where, the day before, three local lawmakers had been denied access. They had been trying to ascertain the conditions within. As I was being processed, shackled, and led into a cell, I wondered if I would be able to report to the outside world what it was like in there.

In a bare yellow cell, I tried to sleep, but when I closed my eyes, I could hear screaming and crying from deeper inside the facility. My requests to use the bathroom or to drink water were routinely ignored, met only after I banged on the one-way glass in my cell and begged agents directly.

I saw other detainees only when I was finally able to go to the bathroom—presumably, they were the other people that ICE was here to hunt. The looks on their faces horrified me. Through observation glass, I saw more than a dozen people crammed into a cell, seemingly lacking energy. They stared at the ground or at the wall. They didn’t talk to one another. One man pushed his face up against the one-way glass, either trying to see out or just desperate for any kind of stimulation.

Elsewhere, I saw a woman, through an observation glass, using the bathroom. She wore a garment to preserve her modesty, but that could not protect her from three leering agents who stood watching her, making small talk and laughing. She cried on the toilet.

I was lucky—after the eight hours I spent in custody, I was released with no charges. It helped that I had a lawyer, Emanual Williams, whom my family contacted as they tried to piece together what had happened to me.

After I got out, I called Williams to thank him. I asked him if it was difficult to come speak with me. Legal counsel is supposed to always be allowed in the building, even when it’s closed. He told me that things are changing at Whipple. “We’ve started to see a process that’s more dangerous towards U.S. citizens being detained, receiving charges, and being transported to federal jails,” he said.

Often, whether someone in custody gets to see their lawyer simply depends on who is working that day. “Some people at the door have said it’s not possible to see someone unless someone has retained us,” Williams said. “One time, I drove up to the guard post outside of the Whipple building, and they told me it was closed. One of the postmen—I think they were part of the police team—approached my vehicle with pepper spray.”

A video of the arrest of my cellmate, a legal resident named Dennis, shows his body being bent forward into an unmarked van as two agents try to force him in. Dennis’ face is placid. A third agent, trying to be helpful, gropes for pepper spray on his tactical vest.

“Do you want me to spray you?” he demands, thrusting it an inch from Dennis’ eye.

“Don’t spray him, don’t fucking spray him,” the agent in the front of the car scolds his partner, swatting the pepper spray away from Dennis’ face.

“I told him, ‘Go ahead,’ ” Dennis had said to me in our cell, laughing.

Patty and I weren’t the only ones detained for trying to alert people to ICE’s presence and filming agents. We’ve since met four others who had similar experiences. I was never charged with a crime; I now assume that my detention was meant to stop me from recording ICE officers.

The effort to intimidate observers continues, but they haven’t been discouraged. Minneapolis is so organized in its observer responses that increasingly, the agency has spread its activities to the surrounding area, where there aren’t as many residents mobilized, alerted to their presence, and filming them. ICE officers don’t want people to see what they’re doing, which is why it’s more important than ever to document it. My arresting agent stole my whistle. After I got out, I bought a pack of 24 more.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">You&#39;ve got to keep your software updated. Some unknown miscreants are exploiting a critical VMware vCenter Server bug more than a year after Broadcom patched the flaw.

The vulnerability, tracked as CVE-2024-37079, is an out-of-bounds write flaw in vCenter Server&#39;s implementation of the DCERPC protocol that earned a 9.8 out of 10 CVSS rating. In other words: it&#39;s almost as bad as it gets.

DCERPC, which stands for Distributed Computing Environment/Remote Procedure Calls, allows software to invoke procedures and services on a remote system across a network. This bug can be abused by someone with network access to vCenter Server to send specially crafted network packets, potentially leading to remote code execution, and on Friday, both the vendor and the feds warned that this - or something along these lines - is happening.

&quot;Broadcom has information to suggest that exploitation of CVE-2024-37079 has occurred in the wild,&quot; the vendor warned in an update to its June 18, 2024 security advisory.

Also on Friday, the US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) added this critical security hole to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) Catalog. This means federal agencies must patch the flaw by February 13 - again, we must note that Broadcom issued a software update that fixes this CVE more than a year and a half ago, and June 2024 would have been the optimal time to deploy the patch.

CISA&#39;s KEV lists the bug&#39;s use in ransomware campaigns as &quot;unknown,&quot; and Broadcom didn&#39;t provide any details about the scope of exploitation, or respond to The Register&#39;s inquiries about CVE-2024-37079&#39;s abuse. We&#39;ll update this story as we learn more about who is abusing this flaw, and what they are doing with the illicit access to enterprises&#39; vCenter Servers.

VulnCheck VP of security research Caitlin Condon told The Register that virtualization infrastructure - including Broadcom&#39;s vCenter Server - is a favorite target for both government-backed hackers and financially motivated cybercriminals.

&quot;As an example, CVE-2023-34048, a prior vulnerability in vCenter Server&#39;s DCERPC protocol, was exploited by at least three known China-nexus threat actors (Fire Ant, Warp Panda, and UNC3886),&quot; Condon said.

Condon said she&#39;s not surprised to see the bug being exploited by attackers considering details about the vulnerability have been public for more than a year.

&quot;It&#39;s common to see threat actors - including state-sponsored groups - opportunistically leveraging even older public vulnerability information to conduct new attacks, so it&#39;s not terribly surprising that the vulnerability has seen exploitation in the wild,&quot; she said.

&quot;While there are no immediate details on threat actor attribution or attacker behavior, vCenter Server should never, ever be exposed to the public internet, so it&#39;s likely the adversary already had a foothold in the victim environment,&quot; Condon added. ®

            <h2>Surrender as a service: Microsoft unlocks BitLocker for feds</h2>
            <p><strong>The Register | 2026-01-23</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2026/01/23/surrender_as_a_service_microsoft/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">If you think using Microsoft&#39;s BitLocker encryption will keep your data 100 percent safe, think again. Last year, Redmond reportedly provided the FBI with encryption keys to unlock the laptops of Windows users charged in a fraud indictment.

The government case [PDF], which claims defendants in Guam fraudulently collected pandemic unemployment benefits, represents the first publicly known instance of Microsoft providing BitLocker keys, according to Forbes.

BitLocker is a Windows security system that can encrypt data on storage devices. It supports two modes: Device Encryption, a mode designed to simplify security, and BitLocker Drive Encryption, an advanced mode.

For either mode, Microsoft &quot;typically&quot; backs up BitLocker keys to its servers when the service gets set up from an active Microsoft account. &quot;If you use a Microsoft account, the BitLocker recovery key is typically attached to it, and you can access the recovery key online,&quot; the company explains in its documentation.

The situation is similar for managed devices. &quot;If you&#39;re using a device that&#39;s managed by your work or school, the BitLocker recovery key is typically backed up and managed by your organization&#39;s IT department,&quot; the company says.

Microsoft provides the option to store keys elsewhere. Instead of selecting &quot;Save to your Microsoft Account,&quot; customers can &quot;Save to a USB flash drive,&quot; &quot;Save to a file,&quot; or &quot;Print the recovery key.&quot;

But customers are encouraged to entrust keys to Microsoft because as long as they have access to the account online, they can recover the keys, effectively making Redmond their digital doorman. However, in such circumstances, customers no longer have total control over access to their data.

Apple offers a similar device encryption service called FileVault, complemented by its iCloud service. The iCloud service also offers an easy mode called &quot;Standard data protection&quot; and &quot;Advanced Data Protection for iCloud.&quot;

With Standard data protection, Apple holds the encryption keys for iCloud data, with some exceptions (e.g. Passwords and Keychain). With Advanced Data Protection, the company has the keys only to iCloud Mail, Contacts, and Calendar.

Both Apple and Microsoft, like other companies, comply with government information demands they determine to be lawful. But they can&#39;t provide keys they don&#39;t control.

Apple says as much in its guidelines [PDF] for law enforcement: &quot;All iCloud content data stored by Apple is additionally encrypted at the location of the server. For data Apple can decrypt, Apple retains the encryption keys in its US data centers. Apple does not receive or retain encryption keys for [a] customer&#39;s end-to-end encrypted data.&quot;

That&#39;s not the case with BitLocker, where Microsoft may have access to encryption keys for a customer&#39;s end-to-end encrypted data if the customer allowed that during setup.

Microsoft explains that it does not provide governments with its own encryption keys. But it does not make that commitment with regard to its customers.

&quot;We do not provide any government with our encryption keys or the ability to break our encryption,&quot; the company says in its law enforcement guidance. &quot;In most cases, our default is for Microsoft to securely store our customers&#39; encryption keys. Even our largest enterprise customers usually prefer we keep their keys to prevent accidental loss or theft. However, in many circumstances we also offer the option for consumers or enterprises to keep their own keys, in which case Microsoft does not maintain copies.&quot;

It&#39;s a clear message to activist organizations and law firms that Microsoft is not building their products for you.

According to Microsoft&#39;s most recent Government Requests for Customer Data Report, covering July 2024 through December 2024, the company received a total of 128 requests from law enforcement organizations around the world, 77 of which came from US authorities. Only four of the requests during that period, three in Brazil and one in Canada, led to the disclosure of content.

Microsoft did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The company told Forbes that it receives around 20 requests for BitLocker keys per year and that it cannot provide those keys if customers have not entrusted them to Microsoft for cloud storage.

&quot;Microsoft is making a tradeoff here between privacy and recoverability,&quot; said Erica Portnoy, senior staff technologist at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, in an email to The Register. &quot;At a guess, I&#39;d say that&#39;s because they&#39;re more focused on the business use case, where loss of data is much worse than Microsoft or governments getting access to that data. But by making that choice, they make their product less suitable for individuals and organizations with higher privacy needs. It&#39;s a clear message to activist organizations and law firms that Microsoft is not building their products for you.&quot; ®

            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2026/01/23/shinyhunters_claims_okta_customer_breaches/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">ShinyHunters has claimed responsibility for an Okta voice-phishing campaign during which the extortionist crew allegedly gained access to Crunchbase and Betterment.

On Friday, the criminals leaked data allegedly stolen from market-intel broker Crunchbase, streaming platform SoundCloud, and financial-tech firm Betterment, and confirmed to The Register that they gained access to two of the three - Crunchbase and Betterment - by voice-phishing Okta single-sign-on codes.

SoundCloud in December confirmed it had been breached and the crooks accessed data belonging to about 20 percent of its users, which translates to about 28 million people, based on the company&#39;s publicly available customer count.

When asked about ShinyHunters&#39; claims, a SoundCloud spokesperson told us that the streaming platform is &quot;aware that a threat actor group has published data online allegedly taken from our organization,&quot; and directed users to a January 13 blog update for more information. &quot;Please know that our security team - supported by leading third-party cybersecurity experts - is actively reviewing the claim and published data,&quot; the spokesperson said.

ShinyHunters wouldn&#39;t say how they accessed SoundCloud&#39;s data, but added that it wasn&#39;t through the streaming platform&#39;s Okta credentials. They also claimed to have broken into &quot;a lot more&quot; companies in the Okta campaign than the two they leaked on Friday, but declined to say how many more or name any of the alleged victims.

According to the group&#39;s Friday blog post, the Betterment and Crunchbase data dumps contain more than 20 million and 2 million records respectively, while the SoundCloud leak totals more than 30 million records, all with personally identifiable information (PII).

Neither Crunchbase nor Betterment immediately responded to The Register&#39;s inquiries. We will update this story if we hear back from either company.

Hudson Rock co-founder and CTO Alon Gal said on LinkedIn that he had downloaded the Crunchbase files and that they contained PII, signed contracts, and other corporate data.

On Thursday, Okta Threat Intelligence warned customers about criminals using voice-phishing kits and campaigns to target victim organizations&#39; Google, Microsoft, and Okta accounts. A spokesperson for the identity services provider on Friday declined to share any additional information about the campaign or ShinyHunters&#39; claims.

&quot;At this time, we have no indication that Google itself or its products are affected by this campaign,&quot; a Google spokesperson told The Register.

The Register also reached out to Microsoft, asking if they or their customers&#39; data had been stolen in similar social-engineering scams, and will update this story if we receive any responses.

Last year, this same crime crew stole data belonging to hundreds of Salesforce customers in a rash of similar attacks. ®

            <h2>China’s Deepin Linux gets a slick desktop - and, yes, built-in AI</h2>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Hands On Uniontech&#39;s Deepin 25.0.10 release shows that the Chinese desktop world isn&#39;t waiting on Western tech. It&#39;s modern and good-looking, and (pausing only to sigh deeply) has built-in &quot;AI&quot;.

Deepin 25.0.10 is the latest point release of Uniontech&#39;s free community desktop, following the debut of Deepin 25 in June 2025.

The original release of Deepin 25 followed about 10 months after we looked at Deepin 23 in August 2024, but the distro does not look and feel radically different from the previous version. It has the same Deepin Desktop Environment as before: the Deepin 25 announcement mentions it being DDE 7, but we couldn&#39;t immediately see much difference from before: the Settings program has been reorganized and the file manager revamped, but it&#39;s not radical.

Deepin 25 doesn&#39;t look much different: no Wayland or anything here. Under the hood, though, things are changing. - Click to enlarge

Deepin has a new Wayland compositor called Treeland in development, which uses the Qt toolkit as used in KDE and LXQt – but for now, this is merely a tech preview: the current release still uses X11.

The desktop layout resembles Windows 11, with the main app launchers centered, leaving the leftmost position for a launcher for Uniontech&#39;s LLM bot, &quot;UOS AI&quot;. We opened it, agreed that we were over 18 and that we understood that the English-language experience might not be perfect, and after a few moments, we were left with a box to type in our query.

We asked it &quot;what Linux distribution is Deepin 25 based on?&quot; The result was reams of text, in which the model repeatedly stated that its training data was from 2023 and it couldn&#39;t access the web. It repeated that older versions of Deepin were based on Debian, but that it could not speculate about versions unannounced at the time of its training data. On the first boot, a welcome video shows off some of the LLM-powered features for Chinese language users, such as automatic document and text-snippet translation, explanations, summaries, and local file search.

We remain unconvinced that this tech is going to change the world any time soon, but for those who want it, it&#39;s there, built-in, and fairly well-integrated. This is an important part of the sales pitch in 2026, we fear – even in China.

Deepin 25 has a partially-immutable OS layout, which the company calls Solid, which is based on OSTree tooling. It protects some system directories, so even for the root user, we found /bin, /lib, /lib64, /sbin and /usr were read-only. It doesn&#39;t seem to do whole-system snapshots, though, and there are commands to disable and re-enable immutability – functions we last saw in openSUSE back in 2024, and a very different approach to Red Hat&#39;s whole-OS approach.

This version also includes Uniontech&#39;s cross-platform packaging system Linglong. The command ll-cli list showed some 20 installed Linyaps packages, including the email client, calculator and so on.

It&#39;s notable that English is a little less visible in this release. The initial bootup screen is in Chinese, and only the word English is actually in English. There are various US English keyboard settings available, but no UK English – only a region, so at least dates aren&#39;t in confusing middle-least-most significance order. (Coercing everyone into what this vulture still thinks of as Xkcd order would be fine with us: that&#39;s the order that they&#39;re written in Chinese, but delimiters are the actual words for &quot;year&quot;, &quot;month&quot;, and &quot;day&quot;.)

Deepin strikes us as a relatively simple and pragmatic distribution. There&#39;s no choice of desktops: it has its own, Windows-like offering – no GNOME versus KDE battle here. It doesn&#39;t engage with the Flatpak versus Snap debate; it has its own Linyaps format. It freely uses bits of Debian and Red Hat tech, but avoids being totally locked down like most Western immutable distros.

It&#39;s Sinocentric but supports some other languages and character sets, international search engines, and so on. It&#39;s not especially lightweight, but it takes a modest enough 6.7 GB of disk and a gig of RAM. It is a little fussy about hardware: we had problems with both VMware Workstation and on the metal on our testbed ThinkPad T420, although the live medium ran very smoothly on a newer Dell XPS 13.

Deepin 25&#39;s Settings app has been simplified and reorganized, as has the file manager. - Click to enlarge

It&#39;s not profoundly technologically radical, but Deepin does the job while looking fresh and modern and attractive. If this is a showcase of the state of the art of Chinese domestic desktop Linux, it really is not bad at all. China has taken FOSS tech developed in the West and used it to create its own OSes with its own desktops and its own tools and apps – which run on its own processors, too.

As we noted last August, tech like this doesn&#39;t have to be world-beating: it merely has to be good enough that China can rely on its own software running on its own hardware for it to risk invading Taiwan, even if that means destroying the Taiwanese chip-making industry on which Western tech relies.

If you want to take a look for yourself, the downloads page offers editions for AMD64, ARM64, and Loong64, plus a preview version for RISC-V. Its system requirements on x86-64 are modest enough: 8 GB of RAM, a big screen (1920×1080 or higher recommended), and at least 64 GB of disk space. ®

            <div id="article-text">Unless you live in a Faraday cage, you&#39;re surrounded at all times by invisible radio signals, from Bluetooth and Wi-Fi to cellular traffic. French artist Théo Champion has found a way to make that wireless noise visible, with an intense piece of Raspberry Pi-driven art that turns nearby radio activity into light.

Champion, who goes by Rootkid online, created a piece he calls &quot;Spectrum Slit&quot; that turns radio signals within the 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz bands used by Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and other commonly-used technologies, into light displayed in a linear array of 64 LED filaments, each corresponding to a specific segment of the spectrum.

&quot;At moments of low network usage, the sculpture emits faint, intermittent light, reflecting the ambient background noise of an urban environment,&quot; Champion explained. &quot;As wireless activity increases, the filaments surge and saturate, forming dense bands of intense illumination.&quot;

Spectrum Slit all aglow with radio wave data - Click to enlarge

A video Champion published on YouTube Thursday showing the build process of the piece displays the intensity of the light in his Paris apartment after neighbors had returned home in the evening, and it gets bright.

&quot;For all my projects, the motivation is the same,&quot; Champion told The Register. &quot;We tend to look past the technology that surrounds us and shapes our lives. My work is about forcing us to look at it, and seeing the beauty in engineering.&quot;

The moment of introspection on our modern technological paradigm afforded by Champion&#39;s work didn&#39;t come easy, or cheaply, though.

As explained in the video and his write-up, Champion built the device using a HackRF One software-defined radio connected to a Raspberry Pi, which together sample wireless signals and convert them into data used to drive Spectrum Slit.

The simple electronics that make Spectrum Slit work - Click to enlarge

Champion wrote the software for the build using Python, but when it came to the sheet metal frame that makes up the bulk of the device, and the printed circuit boards he had to design to make the device work, those elements had to be outsourced to fabricators for a few hundred bucks a piece.

&quot;I work on these projects when I have time, [a] few hours here and there,&quot; Champion explained in an email conversation about how long this effort took. &quot;But I&#39;d say around 3 weeks of research/experimentation then a week for the actual build part.&quot;

As for the parts themselves, he estimates the whole build cost him around $1,000.

You have to hand it to him, though - the finished product is impressive. Paris residents who want to get a first-hand look will likely have the chance to see Spectrum Slit in person, as Champion told us that he&#39;s in discussions to get it and his other tech-inspired art pieces, like a device that fires up a dark web marketplace for stolen data if a user pushes its single button, or a RPi running a Llama LLM that reflects on its own existence until it runs out of memory and resets, placed on display.

Those interested in owning their own Spectrum Slit, take notice: When asked whether he&#39;d consider building additional copies of Spectrum Slit if commissioned, we&#39;re told it&#39;s possible.

&quot;I am open to the idea, yes,&quot; Champion told us. ®

            <div id="article-text">Good news for planet hunters – NASA&#39;s Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) is back online after a short flirtation with safe mode.

TESS entered safe mode after being slewed to point at a target. The spacecraft&#39;s solar panels did not rotate to remain pointed at the Sun, resulting in a slow discharge of TESS&#39;s batteries. A low-power condition was detected, and the spacecraft entered safe mode until ground controllers could address the issue.

Things returned to normal at the end of last week, and on January 23, NASA announced that science operations had resumed.

Safe mode was tripped on January 15 during a week of comet 3I/ATLAS observations.

TESS was launched atop a Falcon 9 on April 18, 2018, on a two-year mission to search for exoplanets. The mission, which detects exoplanets as they pass in front of their parent stars, was extended beyond its original two-year prime mission and is currently planned for operations into the latter half of the decade, with the spacecraft&#39;s orbit permitting observations through at least 2028.

Assuming, of course, the mission isn&#39;t ended by politicians. Had the proposed cuts to NASA&#39;s science budget gone ahead, TESS operations stood a good chance of being severely cut back or terminated altogether.

It&#39;s been almost two years since TESS previously dropped into safe mode following a reaction wheel problem. Engineers dealing with NASA&#39;s MAVEN orbiter - which failed to make expected contact during a Mars orbit - will likely envy the latest recovery.

NASA lost contact with the Mars Atmosphere and Volatile EvolutioN (MAVEN) orbiter at the start of December 2025. Tracking data from December 6 showed the spacecraft &quot;rotating in an unexpected manner&quot; when it emerged from behind Mars. Its altered trajectory suggests it attempted to enter safe mode behind the red planet or fired thrusters for another reason, but the operation failed.

Attempts to contact the spacecraft were suspended during the solar conjunction, when Earth and Mars are on opposite sides of the Sun, but were expected to resume after January 16. The Register understands that an update on the mission is expected soon.

It unclear how TESS ended up in a position where its solar arrays weren&#39;t gathering sufficient sunlight. We&#39;ve asked NASA for more information and will update this piece if the space agency responds. ®

            <div id="article-text">Trump’s TikTok deal leaves lawmakers with even more questions.

Trump’s TikTok deal leaves lawmakers with even more questions.

TikTok finally closed a deal meant to bring it into compliance with the law that should have banned it a year ago, and the lawmakers who passed that law still don’t seem to know what’s going on.

The company announced Tuesday that its US service is now part of the separate TikTok USDS Joint Venture LLC, with parent company ByteDance holding just a 19.9 percent stake in that new entity. The rest is owned by Oracle and investment firms Silver Lake and MGX, as well as smaller investors including Michael Dell’s family investment firm. Oracle will store US data and the joint venture will “retrain, test, and update the content recommendation algorithm on U.S. user data.” The new entity will also “have decision-making authority for trust and safety policies and content moderation.”

The sparse details in the press release shed little light on outstanding questions from the time that the deal was first announced, such as whether a licensing agreement for the algorithm can be crafted in a way that avoids the sort of relationship with ByteDance that would be prohibited by the law. Even lawmakers who supported the bill seem to be in the dark. “Does this deal ensure China does not have influence over the algorithm? Can the parties involved assure Americans their data is secure?” House Select Committee on China Chair John Moolenaar (R-MI) asked in a statement following the deal’s closure. “Those are questions that need to be answered as the Select Committee does oversight of this deal.”

Select Committee Ranking Member Ro Khanna (D-CA), one of the few lawmakers who opposed the initial bill and introduced another to repeal it, said in a statement that the deal “is once again causing uncertainty among many creators.” Khanna pledged to engage with people whose livelihoods depend on the app “to find the best way forward and to prevent changes that could disrupt the rapidly growing creator economy while prioritizing data security.”

Sen. Ed Markey (D-MA), who voted to approve the foreign aid package that included the divest-or-ban bill, later sought to create a legal extension for a deal to get done. President Donald Trump flouted the original bill’s deadlines anyway, and Markey later proposed calling off the ban legally. Now that a deal has been reached, Markey said in a statement, “this TikTok deal raises many more questions than answers.”

Trump has played a significant role in how the negotiations have played out, talking about the TikTok deal with China’s President Xi Jinping, and at one point bantering at a press conference with Oracle chairman Larry Ellison that they could “negotiate in front of the media” over the deal. Markey griped that the White House “has provided virtually no details about this agreement, including whether TikTok’s algorithm is truly free of Chinese influence,” despite repeated requests for details. The White House and TikTok did not immediately respond to requests for comment. “This lack of transparency reeks,” Markey said. “Congress has a responsibility to investigate this deal, demand transparency, and ensure that any arrangement truly protects national security while keeping TikTok online.”

Adding to the frustration for many Democrats is the fact that some of Trump’s close allies, like Ellison, stand to gain from the arrangement. “This ‘deal’ helps Trump’s rich friends get richer in exchange for turning TikTok into a propaganda machine for the White House,” Energy and Commerce Committee Ranking Member Frank Pallone (D-NJ), who supported the initial bill, wrote on X. “The sparse information provided doesn’t address serious concerns about compliance with the law or address the national security threat posed by Beijing’s continued control of the platform.”

            <div id="article-text">The company is developing a ‘new version’ of the characters that will offer a ‘better experience.’

The company is developing a ‘new version’ of the characters that will offer a ‘better experience.’

Meta is “temporarily pausing” the ability for teens to chat with its AI characters as it develops a “new version” of the characters that will offer a “better experience.” The company made the announcement in an update to a blog post from October where the company had detailed more parental controls for teen AI use. The change blocking teens from accessing the characters will go into effect “starting in the coming weeks.”

”Since we announced our plans to build parental controls for AI characters in October, we started developing a new iteration of AI characters generally (i.e. for both adults and teens),” spokesperson Sophie Vogel tells The Verge. “Rather than building the parental controls twice (for the current AI characters and the new iteration of AI characters) we’re pausing teen access to the current version while we focus on the new iteration. When that new iteration is available for teens, it will come with parental controls.”

According to TechCrunch, “Meta said that it heard from parents that they wanted more insights and control over their teens’ interactions with AI characters, which is why it decided to make these changes.”

In October, Meta announced that parents would be able to block their teens’ access to one-on-one conversations with its AI characters, block their teens from talking with specific AI characters, and share insights with parents on the topics their teens discuss with Meta’s AI characters and its AI assistant. The original plan was to roll out the blocking controls for the characters early this year. However, in Friday’s announcement, Meta says it is still working on how to share insights with parents about the conversations their teens are having with Meta’s AI assistant. That feature is “coming soon,” Vogel says.

Last year, also in October, Meta changed Instagram teen accounts to allow teens to be able to see content that’s reflective of what might be shown in a movie rated for people that are 13 or older.

Update, January 23rd: Added information from a Meta spokesperson.

Correction, January 23rd: Clarified that Meta is still working on how to share insights with parents about the conversations their teens are having with Meta’s AI assistant.

            <div id="article-text">The US version of TikTok is now under the control of Larry Ellison’s Oracle and a number of investment firms.

The US version of TikTok is now under the control of Larry Ellison’s Oracle and a number of investment firms.

TikTok is officially under new ownership in the US, and that could spell big changes for the video-sharing app. On January 22nd, ByteDance – TikTok’s Chinese parent company — and a group of investors closed a $14 billion deal to spin off the platform’s US operations, introducing a new slate of American executives.

The Silver Lake investment firm, Abu Dhabi’s MGX, and the cloud giant Oracle will each have 15 percent stakes in the new TikTok US Data Security (USDS) Joint Venture LLC. ByteDance will still hold a 19.9 percent stake in the company, in line with the divest-or-ban law that went into effect last year — though the deal was pushed through with help from President Donald Trump in persistent disregard of the law.

The most visible change so far has been a new terms of service, which is popping up for US-based users hopping onto TikTok. The new terms have some people worried, but some of the sections raising concerns aren’t actually new.

Here’s how the joint venture will impact the app and your feed.

Adam Presser, TikTok’s former global head of operations and trust and safety, will serve as the CEO of the US-based company, while Will Farrell, who previously worked as the head of security and privacy for TikTok’s US arm, will become the joint venture’s chief security officer.

Shou Zi Chew will remain the CEO of TikTok’s global operations under ByteDance, and will get a seat on the US-based joint venture’s board of directors, joined by six other Americans:

You don’t need to download a new app in order to gain access to the US version of the app; it should update automatically. The new app shouldn’t affect your ability to see content from other countries, at least according to TikTok’s USDS website.

The joint venture says the app will maintain “interoperability” with the TikTok used by the rest of the world, while providing users with a “global TikTok experience.” The same goes for US-based creators, as the site adds that TikTok US will ensure users can discover them “on a global scale.”

TikTok’s US arm will, however, use a new version of the platform’s algorithm that the joint venture will “retrain, test, and update” using US user data — a move meant to assuage fears that the Chinese government could push propaganda through it. Beyond that, we don’t know much else about how your For You feed will differ from those in other countries. We also don’t know how long the algorithm will take to retrain, and when it will launch.

One of the biggest changes to TikTok’s terms of service and privacy policy is that it will now collect your precise geolocation as opposed to just your approximate location — but only if you give the app permission to do so.

The updated terms also add a new section about collecting information from your AI interactions, “including prompts, questions, files, and other types of information that you submit to our AI-powered interfaces, as well as the responses they generate.” Though some users are calling attention to other areas of the agreement, the rest remains largely unchanged when compared to its previous policy, which was last updated on August 19th, 2024.

For example, text about TikTok collecting information that you provide about “your racial or ethnic origin, national origin, religious beliefs, mental or physical health diagnosis, sexual life or sexual orientation, status as transgender or nonbinary, citizenship or immigration status, or financial information” was also present in the previous terms. Both terms also say the app will collect your location information and the messages you send on the platform, and that TikTok could share your information in response to subpoenas, court orders, and law enforcement requests.

The deal puts Oracle in charge of TikTok’s security and data privacy in the US, as well as the algorithm. TikTok’s USDS website also says the newly formed company will “safeguard the U.S. content ecosystem and have decision-making authority for trust and safety policies and content moderation.”

With TikTok USDS in charge of what users see on the platform, some users have raised concerns about censorship, especially when it comes to content related to Palestine. Larry Ellison, who cofounded Oracle, has cozied up to President Donald Trump, joining a $500 billion initiative to build massive data centers in the US. Ellison also has ties to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and donated $16.6 million to the Friends of the Israel Defense Forces in 2017, as noted by The Intercept.

Though TikTok USDS doesn’t provide any specifics surrounding content moderation, multiple social media companies have modified their policies to be more Trump-friendly over the past year, and the company’s new leadership could change things too. With a Trump ally owning a large chunk of TikTok, the US-based company may take Trump’s enthusiasm for censorship and distaste for content moderation into consideration. TikTok’s existing community guidelines ban hate speech, misinformation, and content that may mislead voters or interfere with elections — all of which could be contentious under a Trump ally.

Many users say they are deleting TikTok after seeing the terms of service pop-up, with some citing the “fascist owners” and links to Ellison. (Hard data on whether people are actually leaving is tougher to come by.) TikTokers are concerned about the changes to the platform’s algorithm and the potential influence of the Trump administration. Some creators are even calling on others to block Oracle’s TikTok account, as well as informing users how to disable geotracking.

But perhaps the bigger question is how all of these changes will impact the tone of TikTok and the kinds of videos that succeed on the platform. The ingredients that make a video go viral now belong to a completely different party — whether they use that power to further an outside agenda remains to be seen.

Kate Ruane, the director of the Center for Democracy and Technology, urges TikTok’s new owners in the US to remain transparent about their plans. “This deal is concerning because it hands control over speech on TikTok to a new consortium of investors with their own motivations for shaping online discourse,” Ruane says. “Anyone who witnessed the change in ownership of Twitter, now X, knows that ownership matters.”

The joint venture is catching the attention of lawmakers, too, with Sen. Ed Markey (D-MA) saying the deal “raises more questions than answers.” Markey is also calling on Congress to investigate the deal and “ensure that any arrangement truly protects national security while keeping TikTok online.”

            <h2>Casio teased a retro gaming-inspired sampler</h2>
            <p><strong>The Verge | 2026-01-23</strong></p>

Unfortunately, there’s no word on when it will be available or how much it will cost.

Casio showed up to NAMM (CES for music gear nerds) this year with a prototype sampler called the SX-C1 that looks every bit the lovechild of a Game Boy and an SP-404. The top has a directional pad and four buttons just like you’d find on a game controller, flanking a 1.3-inch OLED screen. But at the bottom, there are 16 rubberized pads for triggering samples with crunchy pixelated number labels on them.

The device on display on the show floor was not fully finalized, so the specs are subject to change. Casio says that the final version will have 16 voice polyphony and record samples at 16-bit / 48kHz. It will also have 10 banks of samples, for 160 sample slots in total, spread over 64GB of internal storage. It will also come preloaded with samples harvested from classic Casio gear.

There are also two effects slots, as evidenced by the two thumbwheels labeled FX1 and FX2. What effects and exactly how they’ll be implemented is unknown right now, though a bitcrusher and a delay can clearly be heard in the demo clip below.

Similarly, there’s a grid-style step sequencer that’s giving serious TR-707 vibes. But again, there are no specs for the sequencer at this time. One thing we do know is that there will be proper sample trimming with a visible waveform like you get on the Roland SP-404MKII, the kind that isn’t available on more affordable and portable samplers like Teenage Engineering’s PO-33 or PO-133.

The SX-C1 will have a built-in mic and speaker and can be powered by AAAs for truly standalone operation. But it also has 1/8-inch line-in and line-out jacks, a headphone jack, and two USB-C ports. Those USB ports can be used for power and audio, so you could plug straight into your computer to sample your favorite YouTube clip.

This marks Casio’s return to the world of samplers after a very long absence. Its ‘80s models, including the FZ-1 and SK-1, were iconic, but things have been quiet since then. When the Casio SX-C1 sampler might be available, how much it will cost, and if it will ever even come to the US are all unknown at this time, but we’ve reached out to Casio for more details.

Even with the ability to take excellent photos with our phones and instantly share them across the world, there’s something magical about the old-school instant camera. With just a click of a button, you can capture a moment in a photo that you can see and touch almost immediately. Images captured by an instant camera aren’t as pristine or perfect as those produced by modern digital cameras, but their soft images and imperfections are often a big part of the allure.

Yet not all instant cameras are the same, and some of them are better suited for different needs and budgets. That’s why we tested some of the most popular instant cameras on the market from brands like Fujifilm, Polaroid, Leica, Canon, Kodak, and others.

All the models featured in our instant camera buying guide are enjoyable to use, but each offers a distinct set of features at a different price point. As a result, some are more appropriate for a child or budding photographer, while others are more advanced and provide added creative control (for a price). When it comes down to it, though, we consider print quality, ease of use, and affordability to be the hallmarks of a quality shooter. That’s why we picked Fujifilm’s Instax Mini 12 as the best instant camera for most people, as it ticks all three boxes wonderfully.

Typically, I try to spend at least a couple of weeks, if not months, testing each camera to get a sense of what it would be like to actually own one. I’ll use them to capture photos of loved ones while hanging out, as well as subjects and scenes I stumble across as I explore Los Angeles and its many beaches. I shoot indoors and outside, with and without the flash, allowing me to compare how each camera performs in both bright and low-light environments.I also ask friends and family — both young and old — for their input on image quality, and I have them take photos with the instant camera to get their thoughts on usability. If the camera comes with extra features, such as filters or support for a companion app, I’ll make sure to put them to the test in real-life situations. I note how easy it is to pull up and navigate the app, apply the effects, and, of course, how the results look.

Instant cameras aren’t known for producing high-quality, sharp photos, and most struggle in low-light conditions. However, the photos should at least be clear and bright enough that the subject is discernible and the picture looks relatively true to life.

How easy is it to set the instant camera up and take photos with it? Ease of use is a big part of what makes instant cameras fun and accessible to people of all ages. You shouldn’t need a professional photography background just to enjoy an instant camera.

Instant cameras come with different features at various price points. Generally, the more feature-rich cameras tend to be pricier, but do the extra capabilities justify the added cost? Some cameras, for example, pair with a companion app or feature a built-in selfie mirror, while others let you print images from your phone. None of these are essential, though the added niceties may be worth it for some people.

Some instant cameras aren’t as well-suited for certain situations and / or people as others. For example, there are instant cameras that print old-fashioned Polaroid photos that aren’t very clear. They frustrate me, but retro lovers might find them charming. Other cameras come with advanced creative modes that let you edit photos and even print smartphone photos, but a young child might find them difficult to use.

Each instant camera requires a different kind of film, which means that the sticker price of the camera isn’t the true price. This is something you should take into account before making a purchase, as the cost of film can quickly add up. Depending on the brand, you may have to pay anywhere between 50 cents and $2 a shot.It’s also important to take into account that some film is easier to find. The Instax Mini 12, for example, uses credit card-size Instax Mini film that’s sold at most major retailers. Other types of film, including the film needed for Kodak’s Mini Shot 3 Square Retro, are available on Amazon but aren’t sold by as many retailers.Finally, most instant camera brands sell films of varying quality in a range of styles. Some are decorated with colorful frames and patterns, while others are black and white. They also vary in shape and size, from small rectangular prints you can stick in your wallet to square-shaped ones. You can also buy wider prints, and some brands even sell film with an adhesive backing that allows you to use the resulting images as stickers.

If you’re looking for more creative control or features like filters, however, the Instax Mini Evo is our choice, one that boasts great image quality and allows you to choose which photos you’d like to print. Other instant cameras, like Kodak’s Mini Retro 3, also offer a variety of advanced creative modes for those who desire more.

Take a look at this list of our instant camera recommendations to find the best fit for you.

Produces relatively true-to-life photosTerrific ease of useVery affordable

Instax film can get priceyMinimal creative controlFlash can be overpowering

Film type: Fujifilm Instax Mini film (sold separately) / Film size: 2 x 3-inches / Weight: 306 grams / Charging method: AA batteries / Companion app: None / Other features: Built-in selfie mirror, film counter

If all you’re looking to do is just click a button and get a decent print for a reasonable price, we recommend Fujifilm’s Instax Mini 12. It’s a basic instant camera that’s similar to our former pick, the Instax Mini 11, but with some minor updates. It still takes less than five minutes to start shooting, but the setup process is easier since all you need to do is twist the lens to either “on” or “off.” Such ease of use, combined with the camera’s thinner build, makes it particularly well suited for kids and those new to photography.

For an instant camera, image quality is also better than most of the other cameras I tested, producing relatively true-to-life photos. Most of the cameras I tested struggled to capture low-light conditions well, and this one is no exception, but the built-in flash does help. Fujifilm claims the Mini 12 optimizes image quality in both dark and bright environments better than its predecessor, but I didn’t notice much of a difference. The flash — which you can’t disable — is also still overpowering in some instances, resulting in a few overexposed images. If anything, the photos actually seemed a little darker and less vivid than before.

However, at least the Instax Mini 12 captured my features and skin color more accurately when I used the included selfie feature — which is really just a small mirror mounted on the front of the camera.

You can also zoom in a little more easily thanks to a new lens structure, which you can twist to enter Close-Up Mode instead of pressing a button. When in this mode, you can take advantage of the camera’s new “Parallax Correction” feature, which is supposed to result in a more aligned photo. The lens was fun to play with and reminded me of a traditional point-and-shoot, but actually using it to take quality photos takes some time to figure out. As with the Mini 11, it’s still somewhat tricky to center your subject in the frame using this mode, even with the updated lens. Thankfully, it became easier to properly align photos after a couple of attempts (as well as some composition guidance from the manual).

The Mini 12 also offers a number of other niceties. I appreciated the larger-than-average viewfinder and the fact that the camera comes with a small counter that displays the remaining number of shots, which is a feature many of the other instant cameras I tested lacked. It’s easy to lose track of how many photos you’ve taken, especially when out for drinks or while sightseeing on vacation. Yet given each print costs about $1, it’s important to be mindful of how many shots you’ve got left.

All in all, the Instax Mini 12 is a basic camera that caters to all ages and experience levels and gets the job done — and done relatively well. It doesn’t feature Bluetooth or pair with a companion app that allows you to edit photos (only scan them), and it doesn’t offer advanced features like filters, lens options, or portrait modes. But if you’re looking for an instant camera that offers a great traditional analog experience, this is it.

Great use of dials and buttonsLots of printing flexibilityGood battery life

Internal storage is limitedMicro USB port is annoyingNo viewfinder

Film type: Fujifilm Instax Mini film (sold separately) / Film size: 2 x 3-inches / Weight: 285 grams / Charging method: USB-C (on newer models) / Companion app: Yes / Other features: LCD screen, smartphone printing

One of Fujifilm’s Instax Mini Evo was a favorite of my former colleague Becca Farcase — and it’s mine as well. A hybrid camera that bears a resemblance to Fujifilm’s more expensive Fujifilm X100 line of cameras, it looks good and boasts vintage dials and buttons so stylish that they even caught the attention of passersby as I walked around Los Angeles taking photos. I tested the black camera, but Fujifilm also sells a handsome brown version, as well as a newer pink model.

It’s easy to balk at its price tag, but this camera offers a level of flexibility that could save you money in the long run if you use it a lot. That’s because the Instax Mini Evo includes a full-color three-inch LCD screen that lets you preview and select which images you want to print, which can help you avoid wasting film on unwanted shots. The added flexibility gave me more room for creative experimentation, too, as I wasn’t worried about running out of film. I also loved using the Instax Mini Evo app to print photos from my smartphone. Plus, unlike the Instax Mini 12, the Evo now uses a USB-C port (though older black models still use the Micro USB port) for charging, so you don’t need to keep buying new batteries.

Unlike Fujifilm’s Instax Mini 12, the Mini Evo comes with a few extra features that can help you capture better photos. For example, you can actually turn off the flash on the Mini Evo and use the three-inch LCD screen as a viewfinder. You can also use the menu to adjust how bright you want the film to look when it’s printed, which was helpful given that neither the Evo nor the Mini 12 is particularly good at capturing dark environments.

Additionally, there are dials you can use to apply various lens options and filters, ranging from retro to monochrome shades, as well as a mirror lens, vignette, soft focus, and more. You can take app-based remote shots, too, which adds an extra element of photographic control that can help you take better selfie shots than the selfie mirror in the front.

Of course, it’s not a perfect device, and there are some downsides to consider outside the price. For instance, although you can add filters and make a few edits using Fujifilm’s companion app, it just isn’t as feature-rich as some of the apps for the other digital and hybrid instant cameras I tested. The Evo’s extensive menu system isn’t particularly easy to navigate, either, and it took me some time to figure out how to turn the flash on and off. Plus, if you rely solely on internal storage, you can only store 45 images before the device is full. Still, all of these are minor issues, and I was very happy overall with how portable the stylish camera is, as well as how easy it is to take good photos quickly.

Lets you print photos from your phoneEntertaining companion appComes with film

So-so image quality Unable to store imagesNot as stylish as the Instax Mini Evo

Film type: Kodak Instant Print 3 x 3-inch cartridge (included) / Film size: 3 x 3-inch square prints / Weight: 467 grams / Charging method: Micro USB / Companion app: Yes / Other features: LCD screen, smartphone printing

Whereas the Instax Mini Evo’s companion app is more functional, Kodak’s hybrid Mini Shot 3 Retro is all about fun. The camera’s accompanying mobile app lets you apply frames, stickers, filters, and a wide range of customization options to photos, making it great for scrapbooking. There’s even a beauty feature in the app to conceal blemishes, as well as a set of Snapchat-like filters you can use to add, say, dog ears, making it a fun instant camera to use as a mini photo booth of sorts at parties.

Like the Instax Mini Evo, Kodak’s Mini Shot 3 Retro comes with an LCD screen — albeit a much smaller one — that lets you decide whether to print a shot. It also supports Bluetooth, and you can use the Kodak Photo Printer app to upload photos to social media or print decent, relatively crisp photos from your smartphone. Unlike the Mini Evo, however, Kodak’s Mini Shot 3 Retro retails for around $170 and includes a pack of film (it’s also often on sale for a lot less). It also uses cheaper film; you can often pick up a 60-sheet cartridge for about $17.99, which equates to roughly $0.33 a shot. The fact that the film is cheaper arguably encourages play and creative experimentation, even if the large 3 x 3-inch square prints feel lower in quality and more flimsy than those from both Fujifilm and Polaroid.

However, there are notable drawbacks to the Kodak Mini Shot 3. My biggest issue is that the resulting prints of photos taken with the camera aren’t nearly as crisp or clear as those taken with a smartphone. Photo quality wasn’t consistently as good as the Mini Evo’s or Mini 12’s, nor, for the most part, as clear and sharp. The photos also sometimes had an excessive pink tint, which can affect quality. It doesn’t store images the way the Mini Evo does, either, which means you can’t decide whether you’d like to print them later. It’s also noticeably heavier than the Mini Evo and, frankly, nowhere near as stylish.

Nonetheless, if you don’t mind compromising on photo quality and want a relatively affordable hybrid camera with fun app features, the Kodak Mini Shot 3 Retro is a good choice.

Attractive, retro designPrints dreamy, vintage-style photos that are relatively sharp for a Polaroid photoSeveral creative modesUSB-C

Struggles in low lightFilm takes up to 15 minutes to developBulky and relatively heavy

Film type: Polaroid i-Type Color Film (sold separately) / Film size: 4.2 x 3.5-inch prints / Weight: 648 grams / Charging method: USB-C / Companion app: Yes / Other features: Flip-up lid, scene analysis feature

If you’re looking for an instant camera that offers the most old-fashioned, instant-film experience, the Polaroid Flip is the camera for you. It resembles vintage instant cameras like the Polaroid 600 more than any other camera on our list, thanks to its classic, retro-inspired design and flip-up lid. Its square I-Type film prints and iconic white frame give photos an authentically vintage look, while modern touches like Bluetooth, USB-C charging, and a beginner-friendly companion app add greater convenience and creative control.

Compared to the third-gen Polaroid Now Plus, my former retro pick, the Flip delivers clearer shots with fewer wasted photos, making the extra $50 worthwhile given that eight I-Type sheets are a spendy $18.99. The increased clarity can be attributed to several factors, including the Flip’s sonar autofocus and a four-lens hyperfocal system — which result in sharper, more focused images — along with its excellent flash. It’s the most powerful of any Polaroid camera, and while it can sometimes overexpose images, you can adjust exposure directly from the camera or app. The Scene Analysis feature also helps by warning if a shot is likely to be over- or underexposed, or if you’re too close to your subject. In my experience, the warnings didn’t always prevent overexposure, but they did leave me with shots that looked less blown than those from the Now Plus.

If there’s one thing the Polaroid Flip isn’t known for, it’s portability. Given it’s relatively heavy and awkwardly sized, it’s not the kind of instant camera you can easily slip into your purse or carry around. Additionally, it takes up to 15 minutes for prints to develop, and you must ensure they’re not exposed to light during this process. That’s quite an inconvenience if you’re out with friends, say, at the beach on a sunny day.

Low-light performance is another weak spot. Although it does a better job than the Now Plus, I still struggled to capture crisp indoor shots. Even in daylight, both contrast and color saturation levels are lower than with Instax film. Admittedly, this gave my pictures a more dreamy, vintage look that felt artistic, and you can use the Polaroid Lab to slightly adjust the saturation and exposure settings. However, doing so is time-consuming.

Truth be told, you could argue that many of these shortcomings are typical of a retro Polaroid-inspired instant camera and, thus, part of the experience. If that’s what you’re looking for, the Polaroid Flip is the perfect camera for you.

Tiny and lightweightPrints vintage-like photos just like the Polaroid FlipUSB-C charging

Struggles in low lightFilm takes up to 15 minutes to developNo Bluetooth support or companion app

Film type: Polaroid i-Type Color Film (sold separately) / Film size: 2.6 x 2.1-inch prints / Weight: 239 grams / Charging method: USB-C / Companion app: No / Other features: Self-timer, selfie mirror, film counter

Whereas the Polaroid Flip is huge, the second-gen Polaroid Go is tiny. It fits easily in the palm of my hand — which is saying a lot, given I’m petite and a little over five feet tall — making it the most portable instant camera on our list. It also produces the smallest prints of all the instant cameras I tested, which could be nice if you’re trying to save some space and want something more compact than Instax Mini prints.

Weighing just over a pound, the latest Polaroid Go is also the lightest instant camera I’ve ever held, and you can easily use it with one hand. That’s actually pretty convenient, given I sometimes struggled to take pictures with the heavier Polaroid Flip and, to a lesser extent, some of the other instant cameras I tested. In fact, if the images produced looked more true-to-life and didn’t require you to hide them from light for about 15 minutes while developing, I’d be tempted to call this the best instant camera for travel or small children.

At $89.99, the latest Polaroid Go is the most affordable Polaroid camera on the market, even with its recent $10 price increase. Its film also costs just a little more than Fujifilm’s Instax Mini shots (or about $21.99 for a 16-sheet pack). The camera also sports a few upgrades over the last-gen model, despite retailing for less. The most significant is USB-C support, which allows for faster charging and prevents you from having to buy AA batteries.

Polaroid also claims the camera produces clearer stills than its predecessor, but, truthfully, I didn’t see a significant difference between generations. The photos are a little brighter, but if anything, the original Polaroid Go produced warmer pictures that I thought were truer to life. Still, the photos are charming in the way only a Polaroid photo can be. Contrast and color saturation levels are still low, but in a way that exudes the vintage, almost dreamy look of the photos taken with the Flip.

Unlike the Flip, however, the Go lacks creative modes and more advanced features, although it does offer a helpful self-timer and a larger selfie mirror. There’s also no Bluetooth support and, thus, no fancy app that will allow you to add extra effects. Instead, it’s just a simple point-and-shoot camera, just like the Instax Mini 12, which makes it a little easier to use. In addition, as mentioned, the prints are smaller than those of the Instax Mini, which could be a drawback for those who prefer larger, more traditional Polaroid photos. While it produces similar vintage-style shots, design-wise, it doesn’t look anything like old-school Polaroid cameras, which could also take away from the retro experience some desire.

That said, none of the older Polaroid cameras came with an app, either. All in all, the Go’s simplicity makes it a suitable candidate for those seeking an easy-to-use camera that offers a more traditional instant film experience — one you can use just about anywhere for less than half the price of the Polaroid Flip.

In April, Fujifilm announced the $116.95 Instax Mini 41, the long-awaited follow-up to the Mini 40. The updated model retains the retro design found on the prior model but introduces parallax correction, a feature borrowed from the Instax Mini 12 to help users avoid off-center shots when taking close-ups.

It didn’t take long testing the Mini 41 for me to realize it’s simply the Mini 12 for adults. With its black-and-silver body and flatter, squarer edges, the Mini 41 looks sleeker and more stylish. The two cameras are nearly identical, aside from the design, with the same solid photo quality and feature set. Both battery-powered options turn on with a simple twist of the lens, and each comes equipped with a selfie mirror, a close-up mode, and a flash (which cannot be disabled).

There are a few subtle upgrades to the Mini 41, however. A textured grip in the front makes it easier to hold, and its shape makes shooting in landscape mode more comfortable. But those are small differences, and at their core, the cameras offer the same experience. Since the Instax Mini 12 retails for less, I ultimately believe it’s the better value; however, if a fashionable, mature look appeals to you, the Mini 41 is a great alternative, especially if you can find it on sale.

If you’re looking for an advanced analog instant camera, Fujifilm’s Instax Mini 99 is one to consider. At $234.95, Fujifilm’s latest instant camera is not as affordable as the Instax Mini 12 or the Mini 41, but it’s certainly a step up from the one-button point-and-click cameras given it has multiple brightness settings, focus zones, color effects, and even two shutter buttons for greater creative control. The camera even comes with a tripod socket, an aluminum extension column, and a Sports Mode designed to further reduce blur when capturing fast-moving subjects.

Thanks to the added level of customization, I was able to capture higher-quality photos that looked truer to life than those from the Instax Mini 12, Mini 41, and Mini Evo. Granted, the Mini 99 is an analog camera, not a hybrid like the Evo, so you shouldn’t buy it if you also want to print smartphone photos. The newer model is also less user-friendly than the Mini 12 and Mini 41, so I wouldn’t recommend it for young children. Still, for an advanced analog instant camera, it’s relatively easy to set up and use, rendering it as much fun for budding photographers as more experienced shooters.

The Kodak Smile Plus is another hybrid instant camera that allows you to print smartphone photos. It’s smaller and less expensive than Kodak’s Mini Shot 3 Retro 3 at $129.99, and it’s available in a variety of vibrant colors that should appeal to children. It also comes with a physical filter-changing lens and prints on Zinc paper, allowing you to use your photos as stickers.

However, it lacks a built-in display, so you can’t choose which images you want to print directly on the camera itself. This often results in more wasted shots, especially since image quality is so-so at best, even when compared to those of the Retro 3. Photos are nowhere near as clear as the Instax Mini 12’s, either, especially in areas that are either too bright or too dark.

That said, the Smile Plus does offer a microSD card slot, so you can store and view photos elsewhere. It pairs with an app similar to the Retro 3’s as well, and although the software isn’t as snappy or feature-rich, it still lets you add a variety of filters and frames. Ultimately, I’d recommend the Retro 3 since it’s often available for less than $120, but the Smile Plus is a good, budget-friendly alternative.

From photo quality to the lever you pull to print photos, Leica’s Sofort 2 is a terrific camera that’s remarkably similar to the Instax Mini Evo. In all of my tests, the photos I took with both looked identical. The two hybrid cameras also print smartphone photos via Instax Mini film and offer 10 film and lens effects, along with a macro mode for those who want more creative control. The Sofort 2’s minimalistic look is stylish, too, even if it’s not as charming as the retro-inspired Evo.

The drawback to the Sofort 2 is that it’s twice the price of the Evo. It’s challenging to recommend at $399, as most people would likely consider the differences between the two cameras relatively minor. The Leica user interface is easier to navigate, though, and I appreciate the included lens cap and extended two-year warranty. I also appreciate that it lets you print photos taken with other Leica cameras via the companion app — a nice perk for Leica fans. Nonetheless, I don’t think those perks are enough to justify spending nearly $200 more.

While it didn’t make the cut, the Instax Square SQ1 is also worth a brief mention. Like the Mini 12, the Square SQ1 produces good-quality shots, is easy to set up and use, and features a built-in selfie mirror. The reason we didn’t include it above, however, is that it costs nearly twice as much as the Mini 12 at $159.95, though we do sometimes see it on sale for $100.

That said, it might be worth a look if you prefer large 2.4 x 2.4-inch square prints and relatively true-to-life photos over vintage-looking stills. After all, the SQ1 is still cheaper than the Polaroid Flip and produces higher-quality images than the Kodak Mini Shot 3 Square Retro, which also prints similarly sized square shots.

Fujifilm also sells the newer Instax Square SQ40. It’s similar to the Instax Square SQ1 but with a vintage look that’s more visually striking, yet it’s also more expensive at $199.95. Given it produces similarly good-quality photos, I’d recommend the Instax Square SQ1 or the more capable Instax Mini Evo for $50 more.

Fujifilm’s Instax Wide Evo Hybrid is nearly identical to the Instax Mini Evo. You can use it to print photos directly from your smartphone, though the $409.95 camera also comes with a 15.67mm lens — the widest used on any Instax camera — for taking wide-format pictures.

Ultimately, I preferred the smaller, more travel-friendly Mini Evo, but if you’re into wide prints (and don’t mind spending twice as much), the Wide Evo Hybrid is rather fun. The photo quality is solid and on par with both the Instax Mini Evo and Instax Mini 12. The main difference is that the Wide Evo’s lens captures a broader field of view. It also offers a few additional lenses and film effects, giving users a bit more creative control. I especially liked the Degree Control feature, which lets you fine-tune the intensity of each lens effect applied to your image.

Plus, unlike the Wide 400, the Wide Evo Hybrid is a hybrid camera with an LCD screen — a helpful feature that can reduce wasted shots. However, at $409.95, it costs significantly more than both the Mini Evo and the Wide 400. My other main complaint is that there’s a slight delay between pressing the shutter and the photo being taken — something I didn’t notice with the Mini Evo. It’s not a dealbreaker, but it can be frustrating when trying to capture fast-moving subjects, such as a dog or hyperactive toddler.

If you’re into wide-format instant cameras but don’t want to spend $409.95 — or prefer a more traditional analog experience — the $175.95 Instax Wide 400 is a solid pick. The basic point-and-shoot produces similar stills to the Wide Evo, and in some ways, it’s easier to use, thanks to its stripped-down feature set. That simplicity, however, comes at the cost of customization, making it harder to capture the perfect shot. It also swaps an LCD display for a large viewfinder and is noticeably heavier than the Instax Mini Evo. Nonetheless, if you’re after wide prints at a more affordable price, it’s a worthwhile option.

Fujifilm’s new Instax Mini LiPlay Plus isn’t nearly as stylish as the Instax Mini Evo, but it’s worth considering if you take a lot of selfies. At $234.99, the hybrid camera costs the same as the Instax Mini Evo, but features a 3-inch LCD screen on the back, along with a second, rear-facing wide-angle lens designed specifically for self-portraits. That dedicated selfie camera, paired with the LCD, delivers some of the best — and most precise — selfies I’ve captured with an instant camera to date.

The LiPlay Plus also includes some fun extra features, such as a layered photo mode that combines images from both cameras into a single shot. It can also record short audio clips, which are saved as a QR code you can place in a corner of the printed photo. Both features are enjoyable to play with, though the layered photo mode can, admittedly, come off as gimmicky. You’re basically just dropping a selfie onto a background image with no way to reposition or resize it.

Update, January 23rd: Updated to reflect current pricing / availability, added the new Instax Mini LiPlus, and mentioned the Instax Mini Evo Cinema and Kodak Printomatic Plus.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">We’re still waiting for the first Trump Phone, but one of Trump Mobile’s execs claims a higher spec version is on the way.

We’re still waiting for the first Trump Phone, but one of Trump Mobile’s execs claims a higher spec version is on the way.

Where’s the Trump Phone? We’re going to keep talking about it every week. We’ve reached out, as usual, to ask about the Trump Phone’s whereabouts. As usual, we’re still waiting for a response. In the meantime, it turns out we might have two Trump Phones to worry about.

The Trump Phone may be no more than a whisper in the wind, but Trump Mobile is already planning a second. One of the company’s top executives revealed in an interview that a “T1 Ultra” is also in the works, though we know even less about it than we do about the first phone.

The unexpected comments were made by Don Hendrickson, one of the three executives Trump Mobile brought out on stage at the service’s launch, described then as its head of mobile operations. Last November, he spoke to trade publication Wireless Dealer Magazine in an interview that has so far gone largely unnoticed, but ends with a tantalizing tease of the company’s future hardware.

“Our next major step is the launch of the T1 Ultra.”

“We’re focused on evolving with our customers by offering even more powerful tools that fit their lives,” Hendrickson said. “Our next major step is the launch of the T1 Ultra — a premium device that builds on the success of the original T1 with enhanced performance, upgraded features, and the same bold, American-proud design.”

“The T1 Ultra will offer a top-tier user experience while staying true to our mission of combining value, functionality, and patriotic branding. As we expand, expect to see more integrated services, exclusive perks, and new product tiers — always centered around the same promise: delivering more than just wireless and doing it the Trump℠ Mobile way,” he added.

There’s a lot to unpack here. First is the claim to be building on “the success of the original T1,” a phone that is now five months late and counting, sparking Democratic lawmakers to write to the FTC asking it to investigate. Can an unlaunched phone really be a success? I suppose it depends how many $100 deposits the company has taken, though as I reported last week, we still don’t know what that figure looks like.

Unsurprisingly for a phone to be branded “Ultra,” the new handset will apparently have “enhanced performance” and “upgraded features,” though Hendrickson is vague on the details. The original T1 promises budget specs at a midrange price — though we still don’t know some core elements like what chipset it uses — so there’s plenty of room for an Ultra to improve on it.

The name, of course, echoes Samsung’s Galaxy S Ultra line, though similar branding has been adopted by the likes of Xiaomi, Vivo, Asus (RIP), Oppo, and Honor. For the most part, those phones feature the latest Qualcomm Snapdragon flagship chips, triple or quadruple rear cameras with advanced telephoto lenses, and cost north of $1,000. Anything similar would be a big jump from the $499 T1 Phone, though the promise of “new product tiers” suggests an ambition to hit other price points in the future too.

Then there’s the manufacturing. Having learned from Trump Mobile’s initial made-in-America walk back, Hendrickson only says the T1 Ultra will have “American-proud design,” the same wording currently used to describe the T1. We’ve yet to find out what exactly that means, or precisely how gold we should expect the T1 Ultra to be. Can American-proud design compete with the Chinese retail giant JD.com, apparently about to start selling pure gold iPhone cases for up to $16,000?

Still, there’s reason to doubt in the T1 Ultra, beyond the obvious. Hendrickson claims that “customers are drawn to… the exclusive T1 Ultra phone,” and “eager to buy into” it, an impossibility for a phone that hadn’t even been mentioned publicly before this interview was published. Were the T1 and the T1 Ultra getting muddled together, or was this a prewritten interview intended to go live after a full Ultra announcement that never took place?

“Delivering more than just wireless, and doing it the Trump℠ Mobile way.”

The Ultra isn’t the only interesting tidbit in Hendrickson’s interview. He also claims to have been the originator of the Trump Mobile idea, claiming he “approached [the Trumps] with the concept,” because “they know how to build movements, not just businesses.” So now we know who to thank for all this.

And if you’re wondering about the curious “Trump℠,” which you might have seen pop up before in places like the Trump Mobile website small print, it’s the symbol for a service mark — a variant on the trademark used for services, rather than physical products, and which indicates that the Trump trademark for the mobile industry has been applied for, but not yet approved. It’s yet another element of Trump Mobile that’s still more fiction than fact.

As ever, Trump Mobile didn’t reply to my request for comment.

            <div id="article-text">This is today&#39;s edition of The Download, our weekday newsletter that provides a daily dose of what&#39;s going on in the world of technology.

For the past two decades, there’s been a clear first step for anyone who starts experiencing new medical symptoms: Look them up online. The practice was so common that it gained the pejorative moniker “Dr. Google.” But times are changing, and many medical-information seekers are now using LLMs. According to OpenAI, 230 million people ask ChatGPT health-related queries each week.

That’s the context around the launch of OpenAI’s new ChatGPT Health product, which debuted earlier this month. The big question is: can the obvious risks of using AI for health-related queries be mitigated enough for them to be a net benefit? Read the full story.

In the final weeks of 2025, the battle over regulating artificial intelligence in the US reached boiling point. On December 11, after Congress failed twice to pass a law banning state AI laws, President Donald Trump signed a sweeping executive order seeking to handcuff states from regulating the booming industry.

Instead, he vowed to work with Congress to establish a “minimally burdensome” national AI policy. The move marked a victory for tech titans, who have been marshaling multimillion-dollar war chests to oppose AI regulations, arguing that a patchwork of state laws would stifle innovation.

In 2026, the battleground will shift to the courts. While some states might back down from passing AI laws, others will charge ahead. Read our story about what’s on the horizon.

This story is from MIT Technology Review’s What’s Next series of stories that look across industries, trends, and technologies to give you a first look at the future. You can read the rest of them here.

This week marked a rather unpleasant anniversary: It’s a year since Texas reported a case of measles—the start of a significant outbreak that ended up spreading across multiple states. Since the start of January 2025, there have been over 2,500 confirmed cases of measles in the US. Three people have died.

As vaccination rates drop and outbreaks continue, scientists have been experimenting with new ways to quickly identify new cases and prevent the disease from spreading. And they are starting to see some success with wastewater surveillance. Read the full story.

After falling steadily for decades, the prevalence of global hunger is now on the rise—nowhere more so than in sub-Saharan Africa.

Africa’s indigenous crops are often more nutritious and better suited to the hot and dry conditions that are becoming more prevalent, yet many have been neglected by science, which means they tend to be more vulnerable to diseases and pests and yield well below their theoretical potential.

Now the question is whether researchers, governments, and farmers can work together in a way that gets these crops onto plates and provides Africans from all walks of life with the energy and nutrition that they need to thrive, whatever climate change throws their way. Read the full story.

In the final weeks of 2025, the battle over regulating artificial intelligence in the US reached a boiling point. On December 11, after Congress failed twice to pass a law banning state AI laws, President Donald Trump signed a sweeping executive order seeking to handcuff states from regulating the booming industry. Instead, he vowed to work with Congress to establish a “minimally burdensome” national AI policy, one that would position the US to win the global AI race. The move marked a qualified victory for tech titans, who have been marshaling multimillion-dollar war chests to oppose AI regulations, arguing that a patchwork of state laws would stifle innovation.

In 2026, the battleground will shift to the courts. While some states might back down from passing AI laws, others will charge ahead, buoyed by mounting public pressure to protect children from chatbots and rein in power-hungry data centers. Meanwhile, dueling super PACs bankrolled by tech moguls and AI-safety advocates will pour tens of millions into congressional and state elections to seat lawmakers who champion their competing visions for AI regulation.

Trump’s executive order directs the Department of Justice to establish a task force that sues states whose AI laws clash with his vision for light-touch regulation. It also directs the Department of Commerce to starve states of federal broadband funding if their AI laws are “onerous.” In practice, the order may target a handful of laws in Democratic states, says James Grimmelmann, a law professor at Cornell Law School. “The executive order will be used to challenge a smaller number of provisions, mostly relating to transparency and bias in AI, which tend to be more liberal issues,” Grimmelmann says.

For now, many states aren’t flinching. On December 19, New York’s governor, Kathy Hochul, signed the Responsible AI Safety and Education (RAISE) Act, a landmark law requiring AI companies to publish the protocols used to ensure the safe development of their AI models and report critical safety incidents. On January 1, California debuted the nation’s first frontier AI safety law, SB 53—which the RAISE Act was modeled on—aimed at preventing catastrophic harms such as biological weapons or cyberattacks. While both laws were watered down from earlier iterations to survive bruising industry lobbying, they struck a rare, if fragile, compromise between tech giants and AI safety advocates.

If Trump targets these hard-won laws, Democratic states like California and New York will likely take the fight to court. Republican states like Florida with vocal champions for AI regulation might follow suit. Trump could face an uphill battle. “The Trump administration is stretching itself thin with some of its attempts to effectively preempt [legislation] via executive action,” says Margot Kaminski, a law professor at the University of Colorado Law School. “It’s on thin ice.”

But Republican states that are anxious to stay off Trump’s radar or can’t afford to lose federal broadband funding for their sprawling rural communities might retreat from passing or enforcing AI laws. Win or lose in court, the chaos and uncertainty could chill state lawmaking. Paradoxically, the Democratic states that Trump wants to rein in—armed with big budgets and emboldened by the optics of battling the administration—may be the least likely to budge.

In lieu of state laws, Trump promises to create a federal AI policy with Congress. But the gridlocked and polarized body won’t be delivering a bill this year. In July, the Senate killed a moratorium on state AI laws that had been inserted into a tax bill, and in November, the House scrapped an encore attempt in a defense bill. In fact, Trump’s bid to strong-arm Congress with an executive order may sour any appetite for a bipartisan deal.

The executive order “has made it harder to pass responsible AI policy by hardening a lot of positions, making it a much more partisan issue,” says Brad Carson, a former Democratic congressman from Oklahoma who is building a network of super PACs backing candidates who support AI regulation. “It hardened Democrats and created incredible fault lines among Republicans,” he says.

While AI accelerationists in Trump’s orbit—AI and crypto czar David Sacks among them—champion deregulation, populist MAGA firebrands like Steve Bannon warn of rogue superintelligence and mass unemployment. In response to Trump’s executive order, Republican state attorneys general signed a bipartisan letter urging the FCC not to supersede state AI laws.

With Americans increasingly anxious about how AI could harm mental health, jobs, and the environment, public demand for regulation is growing. If Congress stays paralyzed, states will be the only ones acting to keep the AI industry in check. In 2025, state legislators introduced more than 1,000 AI bills, and nearly 40 states enacted over 100 laws, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.

Efforts to protect children from chatbots may inspire rare consensus. On January 7, Google and Character Technologies, a startup behind the companion chatbot Character.AI, settled several lawsuits with families of teenagers who killed themselves after interacting with the bot. Just a day later, the Kentucky attorney general sued Character Technologies, alleging that the chatbots drove children to suicide and other forms of self-harm. OpenAI and Meta face a barrage of similar suits. Expect more to pile up this year. Without AI laws on the books, it remains to be seen how product liability laws and free speech doctrines apply to these novel dangers. “It’s an open question what the courts will do,” says Grimmelmann.

While litigation brews, states will move to pass child safety laws, which are exempt from Trump’s proposed ban on state AI laws. On January 9, OpenAI inked a deal with a former foe, the child-safety advocacy group Common Sense Media, to back a ballot initiative in California called the Parents & Kids Safe AI Act, setting guardrails around how chatbots interact with children. The measure proposes requiring AI companies to verify users’ age, offer parental controls, and undergo independent child-safety audits. If passed, it could be a blueprint for states across the country seeking to crack down on chatbots.

Fueled by widespread backlash against data centers, states will also try to regulate the resources needed to run AI. That means bills requiring data centers to report on their power and water use and foot their own electricity bills. If AI starts to displace jobs at scale, labor groups might float AI bans in specific professions. A few states concerned about the catastrophic risks posed by AI may pass safety bills mirroring SB 53 and the RAISE Act.

Meanwhile, tech titans will continue to use their deep pockets to crush AI regulations. Leading the Future, a super PAC backed by OpenAI president Greg Brockman and the venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz, will try to elect candidates who endorse unfettered AI development to Congress and state legislatures. They’ll follow the crypto industry’s playbook for electing allies and writing the rules. To counter this, super PACs funded by Public First, an organization run by Carson and former Republican congressman Chris Stewart of Utah, will back candidates advocating for AI regulation. We might even see a handful of candidates running on anti-AI populist platforms.

In 2026, the slow, messy process of American democracy will grind on. And the rules written in state capitals could decide how the most disruptive technology of our generation develops far beyond America’s borders, for years to come.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">This week marked a rather unpleasant anniversary: It’s a year since Texas reported a case of measles—the start of a significant outbreak that ended up spreading across multiple states. Since the start of January 2025, there have been over 2,500 confirmed cases of measles in the US. Three people have died.

As vaccination rates drop and outbreaks continue, scientists have been experimenting with new ways to quickly identify new cases and prevent the disease from spreading. And they are starting to see some success with wastewater surveillance.

After all, wastewater contains saliva, urine, feces, shed skin, and more. You could consider it a rich biological sample. Wastewater analysis helped scientists understand how covid was spreading during the pandemic. It’s early days, but it is starting to help us get a handle on measles.

Globally, there has been some progress toward eliminating measles, largely thanks to vaccination efforts. Such efforts led to an 88% drop in measles deaths between 2000 and 2024, according to the World Health Organization. It estimates that “nearly 59 million lives have been saved by the measles vaccine” since 2000.

Still, an estimated 95,000 people died from measles in 2024 alone—most of them young children. And cases are surging in Europe, Southeast Asia, and the Eastern Mediterranean region.

Last year, the US saw the highest levels of measles in decades. The country is on track to lose its measles elimination status—a sorry fate that met Canada in November after the country recorded over 5,000 cases in a little over a year.

Public health efforts to contain the spread of measles—which is incredibly contagious—typically involve clinical monitoring in health-care settings, along with vaccination campaigns. But scientists have started looking to wastewater, too.

Along with various bodily fluids, we all shed viruses and bacteria into wastewater, whether that’s through brushing our teeth, showering, or using the toilet. The idea of looking for these pathogens in wastewater to track diseases has been around for a while, but things really kicked into gear during the covid-19 pandemic, when scientists found that the coronavirus responsible for the disease was shed in feces.

This led Marlene Wolfe of Emory University and Alexandria Boehm of Stanford University to establish WastewaterSCAN, an academic-led program developed to analyze wastewater samples across the US. Covid was just the beginning, says Wolfe. “Over the years we have worked to expand what can be monitored,” she says.

Two years ago, for a previous edition of the Checkup, Wolfe told Cassandra Willyard that wastewater surveillance of measles was “absolutely possible,” as the virus is shed in urine. The hope was that this approach could shed light on measles outbreaks in a community, even if members of that community weren’t able to access health care and receive an official diagnosis. And that it could highlight when and where public health officials needed to act to prevent measles from spreading. Evidence that it worked as an effective public health measure was, at the time, scant.

Since then, she and her colleagues have developed a test to identify measles RNA. They trialed it at two wastewater treatment plants in Texas between December 2024 and May 2025. At each site, the team collected samples two or three times a week and tested them for measles RNA.

Over that period, the team found measles RNA in 10.5% of the samples they collected, as reported in a preprint paper published at medRxiv in July and currently under review at a peer-reviewed journal. The first detection came a week before the first case of measles was officially confirmed in the area. That’s promising—it suggests that wastewater surveillance might pick up measles cases early, giving public health officials a head start in efforts to limit any outbreaks.

There are more promising results from a team in Canada. Mike McKay and Ryland Corchis-Scott at the University of Windsor in Ontario and their colleagues have also been testing wastewater samples for measles RNA. Between February and November 2025, the team collected samples from a wastewater treatment facility serving over 30,000 people in Leamington, Ontario.

These wastewater tests are somewhat limited—even if they do pick up measles, they won’t tell you who has measles, where exactly infections are occurring, or even how many people are infected. McKay and his colleagues have begun to make some progress here. In addition to monitoring the large wastewater plant, the team used tampons to soak up wastewater from a hospital lateral sewer.

They then compared their measles test results with the number of clinical cases in that hospital. This gave them some idea of the virus’s “shedding rate.” When they applied this to the data collected from the Leamington wastewater treatment facility, the team got estimates of measles cases that were much higher than the figures officially reported.

Their findings track with the opinions of local health officials (who estimate that the true number of cases during the outbreak was around five to 10 times higher than the confirmed case count), the team members wrote in a paper published on medRxiv a couple of weeks ago.

There will always be limits to wastewater surveillance. “We’re looking at the pool of waste of an entire community, so it’s very hard to pull in information about individual infections,” says Corchis-Scott.

Wolfe also acknowledges that “we have a lot to learn about how we can best use the tools so they are useful.” But her team at WastewaterSCAN has been testing wastewater across the US for measles since May last year. And their findings are published online and shared with public health officials.

In some cases, the findings are already helping inform the response to measles. “We’ve seen public health departments act on this data,” says Wolfe. Some have issued alerts, or increased vaccination efforts in those areas, for example. “[We’re at] a point now where we really see public health departments, clinicians, [and] families using that information to help keep themselves and their communities safe,” she says.

McKay says his team has stopped testing for measles because the Ontario outbreak “has been declared over.” He says testing would restart if and when a single new case of measles is confirmed in the region, but he also thinks that his research makes a strong case for maintaining a wastewater surveillance system for measles.

McKay wonders if this approach might help Canada regain its measles elimination status. “It’s sort of like [we’re] a pariah now,” he says. If his approach can help limit measles outbreaks, it could be “a nice tool for public health in Canada to [show] we’ve got our act together.”

            <h2>“Dr. Google” had its issues. Can ChatGPT Health do better?</h2>
            <p><strong>MIT Technology Review | 2026-01-22</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2026/01/22/1131692/dr-google-had-its-issues-can-chatgpt-health-do-better/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">For the past two decades, there’s been a clear first step for anyone who starts experiencing new medical symptoms: Look them up online. The practice was so common that it gained the pejorative moniker “Dr. Google.” But times are changing, and many medical-information seekers are now using LLMs. According to OpenAI, 230 million people ask ChatGPT health-related queries each week.

That’s the context around the launch of OpenAI’s new ChatGPT Health product, which debuted earlier this month. It landed at an inauspicious time: Two days earlier, the news website SFGate had broken the story of Sam Nelson, a teenager who died of an overdose last year after extensive conversations with ChatGPT about how best to combine various drugs. In the wake of both pieces of news, multiple journalists questioned the wisdom of relying for medical advice on a tool that could cause such extreme harm.

Though ChatGPT Health lives in a separate sidebar tab from the rest of ChatGPT, it isn’t a new model. It’s more like a wrapper that provides one of OpenAI’s preexisting models with guidance and tools it can use to provide health advice—including some that allow it to access a user’s electronic medical records and fitness app data, if granted permission. There’s no doubt that ChatGPT and other large language models can make medical mistakes, and OpenAI emphasizes that ChatGPT Health is intended as an additional support, rather than a replacement for one’s doctor. But when doctors are unavailable or unable to help, people will turn to alternatives.

Some doctors see LLMs as a boon for medical literacy. The average patient might struggle to navigate the vast landscape of online medical information—and, in particular, to distinguish high-quality sources from polished but factually dubious websites—but LLMs can do that job for them, at least in theory. Treating patients who had searched for their symptoms on Google required “a lot of attacking patient anxiety [and] reducing misinformation,” says Marc Succi, an associate professor at Harvard Medical School and a practicing radiologist. But now, he says, “you see patients with a college education, a high school education, asking questions at the level of something an early med student might ask.”

The release of ChatGPT Health, and Anthropic’s subsequent announcement of new health integrations for Claude, indicate that the AI giants are increasingly willing to acknowledge and encourage health-related uses of their models. Such uses certainly come with risks, given LLMs’ well-documented tendencies to agree with users and make up information rather than admit ignorance.

But those risks also have to be weighed against potential benefits. There’s an analogy here to autonomous vehicles: When policymakers consider whether to allow Waymo in their city, the key metric is not whether its cars are ever involved in accidents but whether they cause less harm than the status quo of relying on human drivers. If Dr. ChatGPT is an improvement over Dr. Google—and early evidence suggests it may be—it could potentially lessen the enormous burden of medical misinformation and unnecessary health anxiety that the internet has created.

Pinning down the effectiveness of a chatbot such as ChatGPT or Claude for consumer health, however, is tricky. “It’s exceedingly difficult to evaluate an open-ended chatbot,” says Danielle Bitterman, the clinical lead for data science and AI at the Mass General Brigham health-care system. Large language models score well on medical licensing examinations, but those exams use multiple-choice questions that don’t reflect how people use chatbots to look up medical information.

Sirisha Rambhatla, an assistant professor of management science and engineering at the University of Waterloo, attempted to close that gap by evaluating how GPT-4o responded to licensing exam questions when it did not have access to a list of possible answers. Medical experts who evaluated the responses scored only about half of them as entirely correct. But multiple-choice exam questions are designed to be tricky enough that the answer options don’t give them entirely away, and they’re still a pretty distant approximation for the sort of thing that a user would type into ChatGPT.

A different study, which tested GPT-4o on more realistic prompts submitted by human volunteers, found that it answered medical questions correctly about 85% of the time. When I spoke with Amulya Yadav, an associate professor at Pennsylvania State University who runs the Responsible AI for Social Emancipation Lab and led the study, he made it clear that he wasn’t personally a fan of patient-facing medical LLMs. But he freely admits that, technically speaking, they seem up to the task—after all, he says, human doctors misdiagnose patients 10% to 15% of the time. “If I look at it dispassionately, it seems that the world is gonna change, whether I like it or not,” he says.

For people seeking medical information online, Yadav says, LLMs do seem to be a better choice than Google. Succi, the radiologist, also concluded that LLMs can be a better alternative to web search when he compared GPT-4’s responses to questions about common chronic medical conditions with the information presented in Google’s knowledge panel, the information box that sometimes appears on the right side of the search results.

Since Yadav’s and Succi’s studies appeared online, in the first half of 2025, OpenAI has released multiple new versions of GPT, and it’s reasonable to expect that GPT-5.2 would perform even better than its predecessors. But the studies do have important limitations: They focus on straightforward, factual questions, and they examine only brief interactions between users and chatbots or web search tools. Some of the weaknesses of LLMs—most notably their sycophancy and tendency to hallucinate—might be more likely to rear their heads in more extensive conversations and with people who are dealing with more complex problems. Reeva Lederman, a professor at the University of Melbourne who studies technology and health, notes that patients who don’t like the diagnosis or treatment recommendations that they receive from a doctor might seek out another opinion from an LLM—and the LLM, if it’s sycophantic, might encourage them to reject their doctor’s advice.

Some studies have found that LLMs will hallucinate and exhibit sycophancy in response to health-related prompts. For example, one study showed that GPT-4 and GPT-4o will happily accept and run with incorrect drug information included in a user’s question. In another, GPT-4o frequently concocted definitions for fake syndromes and lab tests mentioned in the user’s prompt. Given the abundance of medically dubious diagnoses and treatments floating around the internet, these patterns of LLM behavior could contribute to the spread of medical misinformation, particularly if people see LLMs as trustworthy.

OpenAI has reported that the GPT-5 series of models is markedly less sycophantic and prone to hallucination than their predecessors, so the results of these studies might not apply to ChatGPT Health. The company also evaluated the model that powers ChatGPT Health on its responses to health-specific questions, using their publicly available HeathBench benchmark. HealthBench rewards models that express uncertainty when appropriate, recommend that users seek medical attention when necessary, and refrain from causing users unnecessary stress by telling them their condition is more serious that it truly is. It’s reasonable to assume that the model underlying ChatGPT Health exhibited those behaviors in testing, though Bitterman notes that some of the prompts in HealthBench were generated by LLMs, not users, which could limit how well the benchmark translates into the real world.

An LLM that avoids alarmism seems like a clear improvement over systems that have people convincing themselves they have cancer after a few minutes of browsing. And as large language models, and the products built around them, continue to develop, whatever advantage Dr. ChatGPT has over Dr. Google will likely grow. The introduction of ChatGPT Health is certainly a move in that direction: By looking through your medical records, ChatGPT can potentially gain far more context about your specific health situation than could be included in any Google search, although numerous experts have cautioned against giving ChatGPT that access for privacy reasons.

Even if ChatGPT Health and other new tools do represent a meaningful improvement over Google searches, they could still conceivably have a negative effect on health overall. Much as automated vehicles, even if they are safer than human-driven cars, might still prove a net negative if they encourage people to use public transit less, LLMs could undermine users’ health if they induce people to rely on the internet instead of human doctors, even if they do increase the quality of health information available online.

Lederman says that this outcome is plausible. In her research, she has found that members of online communities centered on health tend to put their trust in users who express themselves well, regardless of the validity of the information they are sharing. Because ChatGPT communicates like an articulate person, some people might trust it too much, potentially to the exclusion of their doctor. But LLMs are certainly no replacement for a human doctor—at least not yet.

It’s supposed to be frigid in Davos this time of year. Part of the charm is seeing the world’s elite tromp through the streets in respectable suits and snow boots. But this year it’s positively balmy, with highs in the mid 30s, or a little over 1°C. The current conditions when I flew out of New York were colder, and definitely snowier. I’m told this is due to something called a föhn, a dry warm wind that’s been blowing across the Alps.

I’m no meteorologist, but it’s true that there is a lot of hot air here.

On Wednesday, President Donald Trump arrived in Davos to address the assembly, and held forth for more than 90 minutes, weaving his way through remarks about the economy, Greenland, windmills, Switzerland, Rolexes, Venezuela, and drug prices. It was a talk lousy with gripes, grievances and outright falsehoods.

One small example: Trump made a big deal of claiming that China, despite being the world leader in manufacturing windmill componentry, doesn’t actually use them for energy generation itself. In fact, it is the world leader in generation, as well.

I did not get to watch this spectacle from the room itself. Sad!

By the time I got to the Congress Hall where the address was taking place, there was already a massive scrum of people jostling to get in.

I had just wrapped up moderating a panel on “the intelligent co-worker,” ie: AI agents in the workplace. I was really excited for this one as the speakers represented a diverse cross-section of the AI ecosystem. Christoph Schweizer, CEO of BCG had the macro strategic view; Enrique Lores, HP CEO, could speak to both hardware and large enterprises, Workera CEO Kian Katanforoosh has the inside view on workforce training and transformation, Manjul Shah CEO of Hippocratic AI addressed working in the high stakes field of healthcare, and Kate Kallot CEO of Amini AI gave perspective on the global south and Africa in particular.

Interestingly, most of the panel shied away from using the term co-worker, and some even rejected the term agent. But the view they painted was definitely one of humans working alongside AI and augmenting what’s possible. Shah, for example, talked about having agents call 16,000 people in Texas during a heat wave to perform a health and safety check. It was a great discussion. You can watch the whole thing here.

But by the time it let out, the push of people outside the Congress Hall was already too thick for me to get in. In fact I couldn’t even get into a nearby overflow room. I did make it into a third overflow room, but getting in meant navigating my way through a mass of people, so jammed in tight together that it reminded me of being at a Turnstile concert.

The speech blew way past its allotted time, and I had to step out early to get to yet another discussion. Walking through the halls while Trump spoke was a truly surreal experience. He had truly captured the attention of the gathered global elite. I don’t think I saw a single person not starting at a laptop, or phone or iPad, all watching the same video.

Trump is speaking again on Thursday in a previously unscheduled address to announce his Board of Peace. As is (I heard) Elon Musk. So it’s shaping up to be another big day for elite attention capture.

I should say, though, there are elites, and then there are elites. And there are all sorts of ways of sorting out who is who. Your badge color is one of them. I have a white participant badge, because I was moderating panels. This gets you in pretty much anywhere and therefore is its own sort of status symbol. Where you are staying is another. I’m in Klosters, a neighboring town that’s a 40 minute train ride away from the Congress Centre. Not so elite.

There are more subtle ways of status sorting, too. Yesterday I learned that when people ask if this is your first time at Davos, it’s sometimes meant as a way of trying to figure out how important you are. If you’re any kind of big deal, you’ve probably been coming for years.

But the best one I’ve yet encountered happened when I made small talk with the woman sitting next to me as I changed back into my snow boots. It turned out that, like me, she lived in California–at least part time. “But I don’t think I’ll stay there much longer,” she said, “due to the new tax law.” This was just an ice cold flex.

Because California’s newly proposed tax legislation? It only targets billionaires.

Here are our picks for the advances to watch in the years ahead—and why we think they matter right now.

Four ways to think about this year&#39;s reckoning.

As early electric cars age out, hundreds of thousands of used batteries are flooding the market, fueling a gray recycling economy even as Beijing and big manufacturers scramble to build a more orderly system.

Yann LeCun is a Turing Award recipient and a top AI researcher, but he has long been a contrarian figure in the tech world. He believes that the industry’s current obsession with large language models is wrong-headed and will ultimately fail to solve many pressing problems.

Instead, he thinks we should be betting on world models—a different type of AI that accurately reflects the dynamics of the real world. Perhaps it’s no surprise, then, that he recently left Meta, where he had served as chief scientist for FAIR (Fundamental AI Research), the company&#39;s influential research lab that he founded.

LeCun sat down with MIT Technology Review in an exclusive online interview from his Paris apartment to discuss his new venture, life after Meta, the future of artificial intelligence, and why he thinks the industry is chasing the wrong ideas. Read the full interview.

In 2026, I’m going to be closely watching the price of lithium.

If you’re not in the habit of obsessively tracking commodity markets, I certainly don’t blame you. (Though the news lately definitely makes the case that minerals can have major implications for global politics and the economy.)

But lithium is worthy of a close look right now. The metal is crucial for lithium-ion batteries used in phones and laptops, electric vehicles, and large-scale energy storage arrays on the grid.

Prices have been on quite the roller coaster over the last few years, and they’re ticking up again.

Cement hides in plain sight—it’s used to build everything from roads and buildings to dams and basement floors. But it’s also a climate threat. Cement production accounts for more than 7% of global carbon dioxide emissions—more than sectors like aviation, shipping, or landfills.

One solution to this climate catastrophe might be coursing through the pipes at Sublime Systems. The startup is developing an entirely new way to make cement. Instead of heating crushed-up rocks in lava-hot kilns, Sublime’s technology zaps them in water with electricity, kicking off chemical reactions that form the main ingredients in its cement.

            <h2>How Flippa Is Removing the Language Barrier from Global Deal-Making</h2>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">For decades, access to high-quality deal flow and sophisticated M&A infrastructure has been largely designed for well-connected investors and industry giants. Small businesses and independent founders, particularly those operating outside English-speaking markets, may often find the barriers even higher. Language, geography, and limited access to networks could mean that opportunity stops at the border.

Amidst this trend, Flippa, a platform for buying and selling digital businesses, is rewriting the script and dismantling those barriers. Under the leadership of CEO Blake Hutchison, the company has connected buyers and sellers across continents, linguistic differences, and price points, closing deals from $100,000 up to $10 million. Now, with the launch of its AI-powered multi-language Deal Room, Flippa is addressing what it sees as one of the last major points of disadvantage in global business deals and M&A, calling it the “Language Tax.”

Founded in 2009, Flippa has grown into a global marketplace where entrepreneurs can buy and sell digital assets ranging from e-commerce stores and SaaS businesses to YouTube channels, online communities, and mobile applications. According to Hutchison, the platform supports users from 189 countries, attracting over 450,000 new buyers in the last two years alone. “Our internal data shows that cross-border transactions now account for approximately 85% of all deals completed on the platform,” Hutchison says. “That growth has been especially pronounced in Europe. As a highly fragmented market with high cross-border trade volume but multiple operating languages, I believe Europe often faces structural friction in cross-border dealmaking.”

He notes that European businesses are increasingly being acquired by international buyers, with US-based acquirers representing a significant share of demand. Yet, as deal volumes continue to decline, Hutchison believes that language barriers have historically slowed or derailed otherwise viable transactions.

Within the Deal Room, Hutchison notes that buyers and sellers can now negotiate and transact in their preferred languages. “For example, a French seller can communicate in French with an Italian or English-speaking buyer, who receives the message instantly translated into their own language,” he says, explaining how replies can be translated back in real time, while preserving the original message for verification and clarity.

Hutchison states, “Our goal is to make deal-making as efficient and approachable as possible. Whether you are a SaaS founder in Paris or an e-commerce operator in Berlin, you should be able to negotiate your exit in the language of your choice.”

Alongside the Deal Room translation tool, Flippa has also launched a fully localized French version of its platform, with Spanish scheduled to follow shortly. The expansion reflects the user demand and the reality that French and Spanish are not only widely spoken across Europe, but globally. Spanish is spoken by 550 million people globally, and is spoken widely across the US and Brazil. Similarly, French, being the 5th most widely spoken language in the world, has 321 million speakers, with 61.8% of those speakers living in parts of North Africa and Sub-Saharan Africa, significantly extending the global reach of European-founded businesses.

According to Hutchison, this shift comes as Europe’s M&A market continues to rise again, with an estimated USD412 billion in deal value, with mid-market and digital-first businesses representing one of the fastest-growing segments. Flippa’s role, according to Hutchison, has been to create infrastructure for businesses to source deals with greater reach than elite investment banks, but with a fraction of the cost.

“We often describe Flippa as the investment bank for the 99%,” Hutchison says. “The difference now is that geography and language no longer define who gets access. The demand for cross-border deals was already there. The technology simply needed to catch up.”

Flippa continues to integrate AI-driven discovery, valuation, and outreach tools through its proprietary LaurenAI engine. “The model is trained on more than 200,000 historical listings and transactions,” he explains. “The system then helps buyers identify opportunities, estimate enterprise value, and initiate conversations at scale.” It autonomously indexes the web to identify businesses across SaaS, e-commerce, apps, publishing, and next-generation media.

Human expertise remains embedded in the process, with certified brokers and M&A professionals supporting transactions once a match is made. As Hutchison puts it, “LaurenAI gives people the ability to access off-market deals and build pipelines the same way Wall Street players do, but without the barriers of capital or connections.”

He notes that entrepreneurs who may not feel confident negotiating complex deal terms in English can now access global liquidity without intermediaries or external advisors. At the same time, international buyers can gain visibility into high-quality European businesses that were previously difficult to source or engage.

As digital entrepreneurship continues to globalize, Flippa is positioning itself at the center of a more inclusive M&A ecosystem, one where language is no longer a tax on ambition and opportunities. Flippa’s multi-language Deal Room represents a structural shift in how global deal-making can be done. For founders and buyers alike, it signals a future where the next meaningful transaction can begin in any language, from anywhere in the world.

            <h2>French fintech Pennylane raises €175M</h2>
            <p><strong>The Next Web | 2026-01-23</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://thenextweb.com/news/french-fintech-pennylane-raises-e175m">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Paris-based fintech Pennylane has just pulled off one of Europe’s most noteworthy funding rounds of the year, announcing €175 million in new capital to accelerate its push into artificial intelligence and expand its footprint across the continent. 
The round was led by growth investor TCV, with participation from Blackstone Growth and a group of existing backers that includes Sequoia Capital, DST Global, CapitalG and Meritech Capital.

What makes this raise stand out isn’t just the size of the cheque, though €175 million is hard to ignore in a selective funding market, but the strategic timing and purpose behind it. Pennylane says it didn’t need the capital to survive; it chose to raise now to double down on AI product development and prepare for a phase of market consolidation in European financial software.

Since its founding in 2020, Pennylane has positioned itself as more than just an accounting tool. It has built what it calls a financial operating system for small and mid-sized businesses and the accountants who serve them, bringing invoicing, payments, bookkeeping, and cash-flow management into a shared platform.

That unified approach taps a persistent pain point in Europe’s SME economy, where many companies still stitch together separate systems to manage their finances.

The new funds will support expanded R&D, particularly in generative AI, with early efforts already focused on building intelligent assistants that help accountants interpret data, automate routine bookkeeping, and deliver richer insights to their clients.

The company is also gearing up for regulatory shifts, including electronic invoicing mandates rolling out across several EU countries and refining localisation for key markets like Germany.

Pennylane’s latest round reportedly values the company at about $4.25 billion (€3.6 billion), reinforcing its unicorn status and standing among Europe’s higher-valued fintech startups. That valuation reflects both investor confidence and the company’s growing footprint: Pennylane is used by thousands of accounting firms and hundreds of thousands of businesses across several European markets.

This deal also underscores a broader trend in European tech: AI is moving beyond buzzy chatbots and large language models into critical business infrastructure.

Fintech tools, compliance software, and productivity platforms are increasingly weaving machine learning and automation into once manual workflows. For accountants juggling multiple clients in different jurisdictions, AI isn’t a luxury; it’s a practical way to keep up with regulatory complexity and expectations for real-time financial insights.

Strategically, Pennylane’s timing matters. European financial software is under pressure to modernise rapidly as digital tax reporting and e-invoicing standards become the norm rather than the exception.

By raising capital now, even without immediate pressure,  Pennylane is planting a flag as these shifts accelerate. The presence of heavyweight global investors like TCV and Blackstone signals that international capital still sees promise in Europe’s SaaS and AI stack.

But there’s a deeper dynamic at play. In Europe, fintech innovation often means balancing diversification with consolidation. Investors backing Pennylane now are betting that the company can serve as a common platform for both accountants and SMEs across borders, a role that gets harder as local regulatory regimes and market expectations diverge.

Generative AI, if deployed thoughtfully, could be what ties all those variations together, letting the platform adapt to local tax rules or reporting needs without keeping teams chained to repetitive work.

From Berlin to Barcelona, founders and investors alike are watching to see whether this latest bet on AI financial tooling pays off. In a funding landscape where some sectors have tightened, and valuations have been scrutinised, Pennylane’s ability to attract major global backers while maintaining founder control and avoiding unnecessary dilution signals that Europe’s fintech scene still has room to grow.

For businesses and accountants alike, the surge in capital behind AI-first tools could translate into more seamless workflows, smarter insights, and faster decision-making.

And if Pennylane’s vision plays out, it might not just be a win for one French unicorn, but a sign that European software can innovate too, not by mimicking Silicon Valley, but by solving problems that are uniquely local, and increasingly global.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">In October 2021, the Beethoven Orchestra Bonn interpreted the first movement of Beethoven’s 10th unfinished symphony, which was completed with the use of artificial intelligence.

A team of computer scientists, music historians, musicologists, and composers developed the ‘Beethoven AI’ to analyze Beethoven’s music style and life, using the sketches he left behind of the 10th symphony, plus works from other composers that had a notable influence on his life, such as Johann Sebastian Bach, to generate pieces that reflect what he would have composed.

Beethoven AI, as others AI composition programs, produces music in the same way ChatGPT produces outcomes. It uses machine learning and algorithms to analyse musical data and patterns, and generative models to produce music based on inputted prompts.

Hence, the AI tool was trained by the team of experts and provided with all the necessary information for it to understand, be contextualized, and finally, be able to create something that Beethoven himself could have written.

This milestone raises an important question that becomes more relevant day by day: as technology becomes increasingly capable of initiating creativity, what remains distinctly human in the classical music world?

Can AI replace the sensitivity and humanity needed to compose, interpret, convey the emotions, or communicate the composer’s intended message?

Classical music has historically been a niche domain. It was born in the house of Jesus as the natural successor after choral music.

Whatsoever, only the most privileged ones, those of noble background or family with ties to music, could dedicate their lives to the study of an instrument or composition, and only those part of the aristocracy had the privilege to enjoy it.

Over time and thanks to globalization and the massive spread of information, classical music has expanded, allowing millions of people around the world to be delighted by it.

Digital platforms like Spotify and YouTube offer all audiences the opportunity to access an immense variety of compositions and recordings across history, democratizing classical music.

Simultaneously, social media allows traditional or innovative artists to showcase their interpretation of it, whether it is a classical performance of Campanella by Paganini or a modern version of The Four Seasons by Vivaldi, played as a trap variation.

The introduction of modern technologies has represented an opportunity for the classical music industry to find innovative ways to remain relevant in a fast-paced world.

The Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra has launched a digital concert hall, a streaming platform for users to access multiple recordings and content on demand. Similarly, the Philharmonia Orchestra uses Virtual Reality to create an immersive experience, allowing the audience to enjoy the concerts onstage, among the players.

However, the new technologies also symbolize a challenge and introduce concerns about the future of human creativity for the creative industries, including the classical music world.

AyseDeniz Gokcin, a Turkish pianist, uses AI to arrange pieces from iconic composers, adapting them to modern trends or to what they might have produced if they lived today, which risks displacing contemporary composers trying to establish their own voices.

From a symphony finished with AI, to the experience of listening to an orchestra being onstage with them, or to have the possibility of listening to your favorite composer in a modern, personalized style, technology brings clear advantages to the classical music industry.

A study in ‘Music Composition with AI’ made by the World Journal of Advanced Research and Reviews (WJARR) highlights how AI technologies can improve efficiency and accessibility, preserve and enhance historical pieces, and unlock new possibilities for innovation in performance and education. Y

et, it also challenges the role of human artistry and raises concerns about the lack of emotional depth, ethical and legal issues, and the livelihoods of today’s musicians and composers.

AI can be a powerful tool and ally for those who are willing to work with it as an extension of human creativity and as a means to explore new ways of expressing themselves.

While those who see it as a threat can focus on seeing AI as a digital instrument that will never replace the touch of mankind, since it depends on artists to create, replicate, and generate outcomes.

Lastly, it is on us, creators and audiences, to make a conscious choice in how we use new technologies and to preserve humanity in a rapidly evolving world.

            <div id="article-text">As Europe races into the AI era, its policymakers are laying new pipes for the continent’s digital future. The European Commission’s proposed Digital Networks Act (DNA) promises to rewire the EU’s telecom landscape, with big implications for artificial intelligence infrastructure, connectivity equity, and the startup ecosystem.

Exposed as part of a broader push to make Europe “fit for the Digital Age,” the draft law aims to modernize how networks are built and regulated, from 5G towers in rural villages to fiber links between data centers.

I have to say it’s a bold vision of a more connected, innovative Europe, but one that must navigate a thicket of competing interests and unanswered questions.

For years, EU leaders have urged the creation of a true single market for digital services. The DNA is a centerpiece of that strategy, aligning with Europe’s Digital Decade goals for universal high-speed internet by 2030.

TNW City Coworking space - Where your best work happens

A workspace designed for growth, collaboration, and endless networking opportunities in the heart of tech.

How can we translate this? Well, I think Brussels wants to turn the patchwork of 27 national telecom systems into one seamless network. The Act’s core objective is to “harmonise the EU connectivity sector by addressing delays, inconsistencies, and fragmentation”, removing barriers to cross-border operations and stimulating investment in very high-capacity networks.

This mirrors the logic behind earlier EU tech regulations;  just as the Digital Markets Act tackled Big Tech gatekeepers, the Digital Networks Act targets the digital plumbing beneath them.

This reform doesn’t come out of the blue.

A Commission white paper in 2024 warned that without cutting-edge digital infrastructure, Europe’s digital economy would stall. It painted vivid scenarios: doctors unable to perform remote surgery, smart farms and self-driving cars hamstrung by slow connections.

Secure and sustainable networks are one of the “cardinal points” of the EU’s 2030 digital agenda.

The DNA is Brussels’ attempt to meet those needs by boosting investment, standardizing rules, and making sure that every corner of Europe can plug into the opportunities of the digital age.

At its core, the Act hands telecom operators some long-sought gifts. One headline measure would grant carriers unlimited radio-spectrum licenses, ending the era of auctions that force telcos to periodically renew their rights.

For Europe’s big mobile providers, this change offers certainty: they can invest in 5G and future 6G networks without fearing their spectrum will expire.

Regulators argue this will “increase investment predictability” and accelerate network roll-out.

In theory, more cell towers could now reach remote areas, and companies might more freely trade or lease unused frequencies to new players.

The DNA couples permanent licenses with “use-it-or-share-it” obligations to prevent hoarding. If an incumbent isn’t using its spectrum in, say, a rural region, it could be forced to share it or lose it,  allowing a competitor or community network to serve that area.

It’s a nod to connectivity equity: Europe doesn’t want scarce wireless spectrum lying fallow while some communities remain underserved.

Broadband for all is the mantra, and long license tenures will come with accountability to deliver on coverage.

Another provision tightens the oversight of dominant firms. Under current plans, if a telecom operator holds significant market power (SMP) in one market (for example, fixed broadband), regulators could extend that designation to a closely related market (like mobile services).

In practice, this means big incumbents might face extra obligations, from transparency to price controls, across their range of services. The idea is to prevent giants from leveraging their dominance in one domain to squelch competition in another.

That could open space for smaller internet providers or innovative ISPs to compete, a boon for consumer choice and startup entrants.

A cohort of six member states,  including France, Germany and Italy, has pushed back, urging Brussels not to centralize control over frequencies and mergers.

Spectrum auctions have long been jealously guarded as national turf (they can fill state coffers, after all), and capitals are wary of one-size-fits-all rules emanating from the EU.

These governments also worry that encouraging pan-European telecom mergers (another idea floated in the reform) could reduce competition at home. In their joint memo, they caution that while a level playing field between telecoms and tech firms is a laudable goal, “this does not necessarily imply the same regulations should apply”to both sectors.

It’s a reminder that the DNA, for all its single-market ideals, must reckon with political realities: Europe’s telecom revolution won’t happen without consensus among very different national markets.

Perhaps the most contentious debate surrounding the Digital Networks Act has been over who pays for the next-generation networks. Telecom giants have spent years lobbying for a “fair share” contribution from Big Tech, arguing that bandwidth-hungry services like Netflix, YouTube, and cloud platforms should chip in to finance the infrastructure that carries their content.

The draft Act steers clear of any direct “network usage fee” on content providers. Instead, it reaffirms Europe’s commitment to net neutrality, the principle that all internet traffic must be treated equally by providers.

Any cooperation with Big Tech will rely on voluntary “best practice” discussions moderated by EU regulators, not on legally mandated payments.

This decision followed intense pushback from many sides. Over the summer, consumer groups and tech industry alliances publicly warned against reviving the “fair share” idea under any guise, noting it had been “clearly rejected in previous consultations” for threatening consumers, competition and innovation.

Even a U.S.–EU trade agreement in late 2025 extracted a pledge from Brussels “not [to] adopt or maintain network usage fees”, highlighting the geopolitical stakes of singling out mostly American tech firms.

On the other hand, startups and digital rights advocates breathed a sigh of relief at the Commission’s stance. Allied for Startups, a coalition of European entrepreneurs, argued that net neutrality is essential for startup growth, preventing a two-tier internet that would “favour dominant players” and raise barriers for newcomers.

In their view, a “traffic tax” isn’t just about Google or Amazon’s bottom line, it would set a harmful precedent that could box out the little guys who rely on affordable, equal-access bandwidth to innovate.

By keeping the DNA free of explicit network fees, Europe is signaling that the open internet won’t be collateral damage in the drive for better infrastructure.

Beyond telecom boardrooms and Silicon Valley balance sheets, the Digital Networks Act is ultimately about the kind of digital society Europe wants to build.

A major motivation is preparing for a future where artificial intelligence, cloud computing, and IoT devices are ubiquitous, and will demand unprecedented bandwidth and low latency.

The Commission’s own analysis stresses that only with the “highest performance” networks will transformative technologies like AI, autonomous vehicles, remote health care, and smart grids reach their potential.

In simple terms: if data is the new oil, Europe needs better pipes to pump it.

The Digital Networks Act sits alongside Europe’s broader tech push by focusing on the infrastructure AI needs to scale. Beyond regulating AI, the EU is investing in next-generation networks, from fiber to 5G and 6G, through initiatives such as the Smart Networks and Services Joint Undertaking.

Faster rollout of these networks would underpin everything from AI-driven industry to cloud services, all of which depend on high-capacity, cross-border connectivity.

The Act also addresses connectivity equity. While Europe’s digital goals assume universal gigabit access and widespread 5G, large parts of the continent still lag behind.

The proposal combines simpler deployment rules with tougher coverage obligations, while allowing flexibility where older networks cannot yet be switched off. The aim is to expand access without letting rigid deadlines slow progress.

Whether this works will depend on execution. Investment still favors dense urban markets, and rural coverage remains a challenge. If the Act can meaningfully lift fiber and 5G reach across Europe, it could help ensure the AI economy extends beyond major tech hubs to the rest of the continent.

From the perspective of Europe’s startups and innovators, the DNA is a double-edged sword that tilts promisingly toward opportunity. On one side, the Act’s push to harmonize telecom rules could tear down barriers that have long frustrated young companies.

Today, a cloud services startup or an IoT device maker in Europe must navigate a maze of national regulations when scaling up, from differing network standards to separate certification hoops in each country.

By creating a more unified framework (for instance, common rules on spectrum and infrastructure access), the DNA could make it easier for a startup in Portugal to expand its services to Poland or Finland without running into 27 different regulatory roadblocks.

Startups rely on an open and predictable internet, and on this front the Commission’s approach offers some reassurance. By preserving net neutrality and rejecting new network tolls, the Act allows young companies to reach users on equal terms, without the risk that deeper-pocketed rivals can buy preferential treatment.

For small fintech or AI startups, avoiding additional network costs matters, and under the current proposal they won’t be asked to shoulder them.

At the same time, founders are reading the fine print carefully. Proposals around a “level playing field” raise concerns that telecom-style regulation could spill over onto digital services, including smaller platforms.

The balance remains fragile: regulate too little and dominant players squeeze out challengers; regulate too broadly and compliance costs can smother the next generation of European tech companies.

As an ambitious blueprint for Europe’s digital infrastructure, the Digital Networks Act embodies a careful balancing act. It must entice telecom operators to spend the billions needed to upgrade networks for an AI-driven future, yet not at the expense of the open internet or new challengers.

It seeks to unify Europe’s connectivity market while respecting that one size may not fit all in a Union of 27. In the coming months, EU lawmakers and member states will debate and tweak the proposal, and the stakes are high.

The outcome will shape not just who foots the bill for Europe’s next-gen networks, but also who can innovate on those networks in the years ahead.

There will be bumps on this road, resistance from powerful telecom lobbies, wrangling between capitals and Brussels, and possibly even transatlantic frictions.

In the end, the Digital Networks Act is about Europe’s place in the digital world. A continent that pioneered GSM mobile standards and championed data privacy now wants to set the standard for equitable, innovation-friendly networks.

Striking a balance between investment and fairness, between scale and competition, won’t be easy. But it’s essential. If the EU succeeds, the reward could be a resilient digital backbone capable of supporting AI breakthroughs and economic growth across all its regions, without leaving its core values behind.

If it stumbles, Europe risks buffering on the sidelines while others surge ahead.

The coming debate will reveal whether Europe can indeed reshape its digital DNA for the better, or if old divides will slow down this grand connectivity project.

Either way, the world will be watching the EU’s next move in this high-stakes telecom reboot.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Berlin’s energy transition sector got a defining boost today as Cloover, a climate fintech based in Berlin, announced it has secured more than $1.2 billion in total capital commitments, combining Series A equity and a substantial debt facility to accelerate the rollout of its software and financing platform across Europe.

The financing package includes €18.8 million (approximately $22 million) in Series A equity, led by MMC Ventures and QED Investors, with participation from Lowercarbon Capital, BNVT Capital, Bosch Ventures, Centrotec, and Earthshot Ventures.

Alongside that, a €1.02 billion debt facility provided by a major European bank will be deployed directly as customer and installer financing through Cloover’s platform, backed by a €300 million guarantee from the European Investment Fund to support scalable, low-cost lending for clean energy projects.

For a company that only a few years ago was in seed-stage fundraising, the scale of these commitments marks a striking shift. The debt element is operational capital designed to help manufacturers, installers, and homeowners finance solar panels, batteries, heat pumps, and other distributed energy technologies under a single unified system.

Cloover was founded in 2023 by Jodok Betschart, Peder Broms, and Valentin Gönczy, who arrived at the idea after interviewing hundreds of installers across Europe and hearing the same frustrations: fragmented software stacks, manual processes, and limited access to project financing. They saw a structural gap in the energy transition; demand for decentralised power had surged, but the financing and platform infrastructure to scale it weren’t keeping pace.

That gap is what Cloover’s platform intends to close. At its core is an integrated operating system that combines workflow management, procurement, financing, energy optimisation, and risk analytics into one environment that serves all parts of the distributed energy value chain. Installers can offer financing at the point of sale, streamline operations, and reduce administrative drag.

Homeowners, in turn, gain access to installations with lower upfront costs and financing terms linked to projected energy savings rather than traditional credit scoring.

Some investors now call Cloover the “Shopify for energy”, a digital backbone that supports the entire process of deploying distributed energy systems at scale. The model is built around scalable capital deployment combined with end-to-end software automation, including AI-driven tools for underwriting and operations.
The timing of this financing is noteworthy.

Across Europe, demand for residential solar and decentralised energy solutions is accelerating as regulatory pressure, rising electricity prices, and broader electrification trends push households and businesses toward clean alternatives. Yet installers often struggle with financing bottlenecks. Cloover’s platform embeds capital directly into the sales workflow, turning financing from a hurdle into a built-in feature.

In a statement, CEO Jodok Betschart framed the new financing as a way to enable energy independence without the friction of upfront costs or complex loan applications, noting that the company’s AI operating system connects stakeholders across the value chain.

For European climate tech and energy markets, the scale of Cloover’s backing is remarkable. Few startups in this space have bridged software infrastructure and finance at this magnitude, and the size of the debt commitment signals deep lender confidence in distributed energy as a growth asset class.

It sets a potential precedent for how renewable energy projects can be financed and adopted more quickly across the region, something both policymakers and industry leaders have identified as essential to meeting the EU’s climate goals.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">To many readers, this may sound like a paradox: how can knowledge ever become invaluable?

In this article, I want to explore how corporate knowledge, when poorly structured and rigidly transferred, can slowly transform from an asset into a disadvantage. Not only for companies, but especially for employees. And over time, that disadvantage compounds.

The journey usually looks familiar. You apply for a job, speak with a recruiter, send your CV, go through interviews, and eventually receive the green-light email: “Congratulations, you’re hired.”

This moment takes us directly to the real turning point: the onboarding process.

The latest rumblings from the EU tech scene, a story from our wise ol&#39; founder Boris, and some questionable AI art. It&#39;s free, every week, in your inbox. Sign up now!

Those first one, two, sometimes even three months when you are introduced to the people, the tools, the workflows, the strategies, and the “way things are done.” On paper, onboarding exists to accelerate integration and performance. In reality, in many corporations, it quietly becomes an indoctrination phase.

Relatable to anyone who has worked in large organizations, onboarding often shifts from enabling understanding to enforcing conformity. New hires are not only taught what the company knows, but also what the company no longer questions.

This is where corporate knowledge starts becoming invaluable.

Because instead of acting as a foundation to build on, it becomes a ceiling.

It tells you what to do, how to do it, and more importantly, what not to rethink. Over time, this “do according to the manual” culture doesn’t just standardize execution. It standardizes thinking. And standardized thinking is the natural enemy of innovation.

History shows us a consistent pattern: breakthroughs rarely come from the center of an industry. They come from the edges.

Elon Musk was not an automotive executive. He treated cars as computers on wheels and energy systems. The result? An entire industry forced to reset its assumptions.

Travis Kalanick and Garrett Camp were not transportation insiders. They were technologists. They saw GPS-enabled phones, invisible payments, and drivers that didn’t need to be owned. They reframed taxis not as a fleet problem, but as a software and trust problem. And the taxi industry, as it existed, effectively ended.

These examples point to a simple truth: transformative ideas usually emerge from new mental models, not from perfected manuals.

Yet most onboarding processes are designed to remove new mental models as quickly as possible.

They don’t ask: “What do you see that we no longer notice?”
 They ask: “How fast can you adapt to how we already work?”

Most programs teach tools, not systems. New hires learn where to click, not how to think. They are trained on CRMs, scripts, workflows, and reporting routines, but not on AI-assisted decision-making, signal-based prospecting, or how to design work alongside automated agents.

As a result, organizations scale activity instead of intelligence.

Even worse, onboarding still assumes that humans should work like software: following rigid processes, filling manual reports, executing predefined sequences. Instead of being taught how to orchestrate software, delegate to AI, and concentrate on judgment, creativity, and relationships.

Over time, this creates a paradoxical outcome: the more “knowledge” an organization accumulates, the harder it becomes for new ideas to survive inside it.

And when knowledge can no longer be challenged, recombined, or re-imagined, it stops being knowledge.
