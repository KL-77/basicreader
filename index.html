            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The global cost of greenhouse gas emissions is nearly double what scientists previously thought, according to a study published Thursday by researchers at the University of California, San Diego’s Scripps Institution of Oceanography.

It is the first time a social cost of carbon (SCC) assessment—a key measure of economic harm caused by climate change—has included damages to the ocean. Global coral loss, fisheries disruption, and coastal infrastructure destruction are estimated to cost nearly $2 trillion annually, fundamentally changing how we measure climate finance.

“For decades, we’ve been estimating the economic cost of climate change while effectively assigning a value of zero to the ocean,” said Bernardo Bastien-Olvera, who led the study during his postdoctoral fellowship at Scripps. “Ocean loss is not just an environmental issue, but a central part of the economic story of climate change.”

The social cost of carbon is an accounting method for working out the monetary cost of each ton of carbon dioxide released into the atmosphere. “[It] is one of the most efficient tools we have for internalizing climate damages into economic decision-making,” said Amy Campbell, a United Nations climate advisor and former British government COP negotiator.

Calculations have historically been used by international organizations and state departments like the US Environmental Protection Agency to assess policy proposals—though a 2025 White House memo from the Trump administration instructed federal agencies to ignore the data during cost-benefit analyses unless required by law.

“It becomes politically contentious when deciding whose damages are counted, which sectors are included and most importantly how future and retrospective harms are valued,” Campbell said.

Excluding ocean harm, the social cost of carbon is $51 per ton of carbon dioxide emitted. This increases to $97.20 per ton when the ocean, which covers 70 percent of the planet, is included. In 2024, global CO2 emissions were estimated to be 41.6 billion tons, making the 91 percent cost increase significant.

Using greenhouse gas emission predictions, the report estimates the annual damages to traditional markets alone will be $1.66 trillion by 2100.

The study, which began in 2021, brought together scientists from multiple disciplines: Fisheries experts, coral reef researchers, biologists and climate economists. They assessed downstream climate change costs across four key sectors—corals, mangroves, fisheries, and seaports—measuring everything from straightforward market loss of reduced fisheries and marine trade to reductions in ocean-based recreational industries.

Researchers also placed a monetary figure on what economists call non-use values. “Something has value because it makes the world feel more livable, meaningful, or worth protecting, even if we never directly use it,” said Bastien-Olvera, referencing the fiscal merit of ecosystem enjoyment and the cultural loss caused by climate change. “Most people will never visit a coral reef during a full-moon spawning event, or see a deep-sea jellyfish glowing in total darkness. But many still care deeply that these things exist.”

Island economies, which rely more on seafood for nutrition, will face disproportionate financial and health impacts from ocean warming and acidification, the study said. “The countries that have the most responsibility for causing climate change and the most capacity to fix it are not generally the same countries that will experience the largest or most near-term damages,” said Kate Ricke, co-author and climate professor at UCSD’s School of Global Policy and Strategy. Including ocean data in social cost of carbon assessments reveals increased consequences for morbidity and mortality in low-income countries facing increased nutrition deficiency.

Despite the scale of the scientific discovery, Bastien-Olvera and Ricke are optimistic this data will be a wake-up call for international decision-making. “I hope that the high value of ‘blueSCC’ can motivate further investment in adaptation and resilience for ocean systems,” said Ricke, using the term of the ocean-based social cost of carbon and referencing the opportunities to invest in coral reef and mangrove restoration projects.

Meanwhile, Bastien-Olvera believes centering the framework on oceans also recognizes the longstanding conservation approaches of coastal communities, ocean scientists and Indigenous peoples. “For a long time, climate economics treated the ocean values as if it were worth zero,” he said. “This is a first step toward finally acknowledging how wrong that was.”

            <h2>Meta’s layoffs leave Supernatural fitness users in mourning</h2>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Tencia Benavidez, a Supernatural user who lives in New Mexico, started her VR workouts during the Covid pandemic. She has been a regular user in the five years since, calling the ability to work out in VR ideal, given that she lives in a rural area where it’s hard to get to a gym or work out outside during a brutal winter. She stuck with Supernatural because of the community and the eagerness of Supernatural’s coaches.

“They seem like really authentic individuals that were not talking down to you,” Benavidez says. “There’s just something really special about those coaches.”

Meta bought Supernatural in 2022, folding it into its then-heavily-invested-in metaverse efforts. The purchase was not a smooth process, as it triggered a lengthy legal battle in which the US Federal Trade Commission tried to block Meta from purchasing the service due to antitrust concerns about Meta “trying to buy its way to the top” of the VR market. Meta ultimately prevailed. At the time, some Supernatural users were cautiously optimistic, hoping that big bag of Zuckerbucks could keep its workout juggernaut afloat.

“Meta fought the government to buy this thing,” Benavidez says. “All that just for them to shut it down? What was the point?”

I reached out to Meta and Supernatural, and neither responded to my requests for comment.

On Tuesday, Bloomberg reported that Meta has laid off more than 1,000 people across its VR and metaverse efforts. The move comes after years of the company hemorrhaging billions of dollars on its metaverse products. In addition to laying off most of the staff at Supernatural, Meta has shut down three internal VR studios that made games like Resident Evil 4 and Deadpool VR.

“If it was a bottom-line thing, I think they could have charged more money,” Goff Johnson says about Supernatural. “I think people would have paid for it. This just seems unnecessarily heartless.”

There is a split in the community about who will stay and continue to pay the subscription fee and who will leave. Supernatural has more than 3,000 lessons available in the service, so while new content won’t be added, some feel there is plenty of content left in the library. Other users worry about how Supernatural will continue to license music from big-name bands.

“Supernatural is amazing, but I am canceling it because of this,” Chip told me. “The library is large, so there’s enough to keep you busy, but not for the same price.”

There are other VR workout experiences like FitXR or even the VR staple Beat Saber, which Supernatural cribs a lot of design concepts from. Still, they don’t hit the same bar for many of the Supernatural faithful.

“I’m going to stick it out until they turn the lights out on us,” says Stefanie Wong, a Bay Area accountant who has used Supernatural since shortly after the pandemic and has organized and attended meetup events. “It’s not the app. It’s the community, and it’s the coaches that we really, really care about.”

I tried out Supernatural’s Together feature on Wednesday, the day after the layoffs. It’s where I met Chip and Alisa. When we could stop to catch our breath, we talked about the changes coming to the service. They had played through previous sessions hosted by Jane Fonda or playlists with a mix of music that would change regularly. This one was an artist series featuring entirely Imagine Dragons songs.

In the session, as we punched blocks while being serenaded by this shirtless dude crooning, recorded narrations from Supernatural coach Dwana Olsen chimed in to hype us up.

“Take advantage of these moments,” Olsen said as we punched away. “Use these movements to remind you of how much awesome life you have yet to live.”

Frankly, it was downright invigorating. And bittersweet. We ended another round, sweaty, huffing and puffing. Chip, Alisa, and I high-fived like crazy and readied for another round.

“Beautiful,” Alisa said. “It’s just beautiful, isn’t it?”</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">KENNEDY SPACE CENTER, Florida—The rocket NASA is preparing to send four astronauts on a trip around the Moon will emerge from its assembly building on Florida’s Space Coast early Saturday for a slow crawl to its seaside launch pad.

Riding atop one of NASA’s diesel-powered crawler transporters, the Space Launch System rocket and its mobile launch platform will exit the Vehicle Assembly Building at Kennedy Space Center around 7:00 am EST (11:00 UTC). The massive tracked transporter, certified by Guinness as the world’s heaviest self-propelled vehicle, is expected to cover the four miles between the assembly building and Launch Complex 39B in about eight to 10 hours.

The rollout marks a major step for NASA’s Artemis II mission, the first human voyage to the vicinity of the Moon since the last Apollo lunar landing in December 1972. Artemis II will not land. Instead, a crew of four astronauts will travel around the far side of the Moon at a distance of several thousand miles, setting the record for the farthest humans have ever ventured from Earth.

The flight will culminate with a scorching 25,000 mph (40,000 km per hour) reentry over the Pacific Ocean. The four Artemis II astronauts—NASA’s Reid Wiseman, Victor Glover, Christina Koch, and Canada’s Jeremy Hansen—will become the fastest humans in history, edging out a speed record set during the Apollo era of lunar exploration.

The journey for the fully-assembled Moon rocket will begin early Saturday at a slower pace. After leaving the Vehicle Assembly Building, the moving 11 million-pound structure will head east, then make a left turn before climbing the ramp to Pad 39B overlooking the Atlantic Ocean.

“We will be at a cruising speed of under one mile per hour,” said Charlie Blackwell-Thompson, NASA’s launch director for the Artemis II mission. “It’ll be a little slower around the turns and up the hill.”

The crawler carrying the SLS rocket and Orion spacecraft was built 60 years ago to haul NASA’s Saturn V rockets, then kept around for the Space Shuttle Program. Now, the vehicle is back to its original purpose of positioning Moon-bound rockets on their launch pads.

“These are the kinds of days that we live for when you do the kind of work that we do,” said John Honeycutt, chair of NASA’s Mission Management Team for the Artemis II mission. “The rocket and the spacecraft, Orion Integrity, are getting ready to roll to the pad … It really doesn’t get much better than this, and we’re making history.”

You can watch live views of the rollout in this YouTube stream provided by NASA.

Artemis II is the first crew flight of NASA’s Artemis program, an initiative named for the twin sister of Apollo in Greek mythology. NASA named the program Artemis in 2019, but some of the building blocks have been around for 20 years.

NASA selected Orion contractor Lockheed Martin to oversee the development of a deep space capsule in 2006 as part of the George W. Bush administration’s soon-to-be canceled Constellation program. In 2011, a political bargain between the Obama administration and Congress revived the Orion program and kicked off development of the Space Launch System. The announcement of the Artemis program in 2019 leaned on work already underway on Orion and the SLS rocket as the centerpieces of an architecture to return US astronauts to the Moon.

Tens of billions of dollars later, everything is finally coming together for the final all-important milestone in developing the vehicles for transporting crews between the Earth and the Moon. A human-rated lunar lander and spacesuits tailored for Moonwalking astronauts are still a few years away from readiness. NASA has contracts with SpaceX and Blue Origin for landers, and with Axiom Space for suits.

A successful Artemis II mission would demonstrate to NASA’s managers and engineers that the Orion spacecraft and SLS rocket fulfill their roles in the Artemis architecture. NASA is expected to rely on the SLS rocket, which costs more than $2 billion per flight and is expendable by design, for several more missions until commercial alternatives are available.

America’s return to the Moon now has a geopolitical imperative. China is working to land its own astronauts on the lunar surface by 2030, and US officials want to beat the Chinese to the Moon for the motivation of national prestige and the material benefits of accessing lunar resources, among other reasons. For now, budget-writing lawmakers in Congress and President Donald Trump’s new NASA chief, Jared Isaacman, agree the existing SLS/Orion architecture, despite its cost and shortcomings, offers the surest opportunity to beat the Chinese space program to a crew lunar landing.

Then, if all goes according to plan, NASA can turn to cheaper (and in one case, more capable) rockets to help the government afford the expenditure required to construct a Moon base.

“Putting crew on the rocket and taking the crew around the Moon, this is going be our first step toward a sustained lunar presence,” Honeycutt said. “It’s 10 days [and] four astronauts going farther from Earth than any other human has ever traveled. We’ll be validating the Orion spacecraft’s life support, navigation and crew systems in the really harsh environments of deep space, and that’s going to pave the way for future landings.”

There is still much work ahead before NASA can clear Artemis II for launch. At the launch pad, technicians will complete final checkouts and closeouts before NASA’s launch team gathers in early February for a critical practice countdown. During this countdown, called a Wet Dress Rehearsal (WDR), Blackwell-Thompson and her team will oversee the loading of the SLS rocket’s core stage and upper stage with super-cold liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen propellants.

The cryogenic fluids, particularly liquid hydrogen, gave fits to the Artemis launch team as NASA prepared to launch the Artemis I mission—without astronauts—on the SLS rocket’s first test flight in 2022. Engineers resolved the issues and successfully launched the Artemis I mission in November 2022, and officials will apply the lessons for the Artemis II countdown.

“Artemis I was a test flight, and we learned a lot during that campaign getting to launch,” Blackwell-Thompson said. “And the things that we’ve learned relative to how to go load this vehicle, how to load LOX (liquid oxygen), how to load hydrogen, have all been rolled in to the way in which we intend to do for the Artemis II vehicle.”

Assuming the countdown rehearsal goes according to plan, NASA could be in a position to launch the Artemis II mission as soon as February 6. But the schedule for February 6 is tight, with no margin for error. Officials typically have about five days per month when they can launch Artemis II, when the Moon is in the right position relative to Earth, and the Orion spacecraft can follow the proper trajectory toward reentry and splashdown to limit stress on the capsule’s heat shield.

In February, the available launch dates are February 6, 7, 8, 10, and 11, with launch windows in the overnight hours in Florida. If the mission isn’t off the ground by February 11, NASA will have to stand down until a new series of launch opportunities beginning March 6. The space agency has posted a document showing all available launch dates and times through the end of April.

NASA’s leaders are eager for Artemis II to fly. NASA is not only racing China, a reality the agency’s former administrator acknowledged during the Biden administration. Now, the Trump administration is pushing NASA to accomplish a human landing on the Moon by the end of his presidential term on January 20, 2029.

One of Honeycutt’s jobs as chair of the Mission Management Team (MMT) is ensuring all the Is are dotted and Ts are crossed amid the frenzy of final launch preparations. While the hardware for Artemis II is on the move in Florida, the astronauts and flight controllers are wrapping up their final training and simulations at Johnson Space Center in Houston.

“I think I’ve got a good eye for launch fever,” he said Friday.

“As chair of the MMT, I’ve got one job, and it’s the safe return of Reid, Victor, Christina, and Jeremy. I consider that a duty and a trust, and it’s one I intend to see through.”</div>

            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2026/01/rackspace-raises-email-hosting-prices-by-as-much-as-706-percent/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Rackspace’s new pricing for its email hosting services is “devastating,” according to a partner that has been using Rackspace as its email provider since 1999.

In recent weeks, Rackspace updated its email hosting pricing. Its standard plan is now $10 per mailbox per month. Businesses can also pay for the Rackspace Email Plus add-on for an extra $2/mailbox/month (for “file storage, mobile sync, Office-compatible apps, and messaging”), and the Archiving add-on for an extra $6/mailbox/month (for unlimited storage).

As recently as November 2025, Rackspace charged $3/mailbox/month for its Standard plan, and an extra $1/mailbox/month for the Email Plus add-on, and an additional $3/mailbox/month for the Archival add-on, according to the Internet Archive’s Wayback Machine.

Rackspace’s reseller partners have been especially vocal about the impacts of the new pricing.

In a blog post on Thursday, web hosting service provider and Rackspace reseller Laughing Squid said Rackspace is “increasing our email pricing by an astronomical 706 percent, with only a month-and-a half’s notice.”

Laughing Squid founder Scott Beale told Ars Technica that he received the “devastating” news via email on Wednesday. The last time Rackspace increased Laughing Squid’s email prices was by 55 percent in 2019, he said.

“The price increase has a major impact on the ability to make money due to the fact that email is now our largest expense, and we were only given a month-and-a-half notice,” Beale told Ars.

Online, there are reports of Rackspace partners being quoted email pricing increases of 110 percent to nearly 500 percent. The reports say that the new, higher-per-mailbox quotes don’t include volume pricing discounts. Beale noted that Laughing Squid’s quote doesn’t include discounts that the company previously received.

“We had really good reseller pricing that we negotiated with Rackspace due to the number of mailboxes we had with them and how long we had been a customer. All of that seemed to vanish when they notified us of their new pricing,” he said.

Ars contacted Rackspace asking about the 706 percent price hike that Laughing Squid says it’s facing, why Rackspace decided to increase its prices now, and why it didn’t give its partners more advanced notice. A company spokesperson responded, saying:

Rackspace Email is a reliable and secure business-class email solution for small businesses. To continue delivering the service levels our customers expect, effective March 2026, Rackspace Technology is increasing the price of Rackspace Email. We have a support team available to help our customers to discuss their options.

The spokesperson added that Rackspace’s “mission is to deliver quality, trusted and reliable hosted email solution for businesses.”

Despite Rackspace’s stated commitment to email hosting, the prohibitive pricing seems like a deterrent for a business being viewed as high-effort and low-margin. Email has grown complex over the years, requiring time and expertise for proper management at scale. It’s become simpler, or more lucrative, for some cloud companies to focus on selling their managed services on top of offerings like Microsoft 365—as Rackspace does—or Google Workspace and let the larger companies behind those solutions deal with infrastructure costs and complexities.

Rackspace’s price hike also comes as an AI-driven RAM shortage is impacting the availability and affordability of other computing components, including storage.

With Rackspace, which went public in 2020, also having quit hosting Microsoft Exchange following a costly 2022 ransomware attack, the Texas-headquartered company may be looking to minimize its email hosting duties as much as possible.

Meanwhile, Laughing Squid is increasing prices for Rackspace mailboxes and offering services with a different email provider, PolarisMail, to customers at lower prices. Beale said he has reached out to Rackspace about the new pricing but hasn’t heard back yet.</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Archaeologists recently found the wreck of an enormous medieval cargo ship lying on the seafloor off the Danish coast, and it reveals new details of medieval trade and life at sea.

Archaeologists discovered the shipwreck while surveying the seabed in preparation for a construction project for the city of Copenhagen, Denmark. It lay on its side, half-buried in the sand, 12 meters below the choppy surface of the Øresund, the straight that runs between Denmark and Sweden. By comparing the tree rings in the wreck’s wooden planks and timbers with rings from other, precisely dated tree samples, the archaeologists concluded that the ship had been built around 1410 CE.

Svaelget 2, as archaeologists dubbed the wreck (its original name is long since lost to history), was a type of merchant ship called a cog: a wide, flat-bottomed, high-sided ship with an open cargo hold and a square sail on a single mast. A bigger, heavier, more advanced version of the Viking knarrs of centuries past, the cog was the high-tech supertanker of its day. It was built to carry bulky commodities from ports in the Netherlands, north around the coast of Denmark, and then south through the Øresund to trading ports on the Baltic Sea—but this one didn’t quite make it.

Most cogs would have been about 15 to 25 meters long and 5 to 8 meters wide, capable of carrying about 200 tons of cargo—big, impressive ships for their time. But Svaelget 2, an absolute unit of a ship, measured about 28 meters from bow to stern, 9 meters wide, and could have carried about 300 tons. Its size alone was a surprise to the archaeologists.

“We now know, undeniably, that cogs could be this large—that the ship type could be pushed to this extreme,” said archaeologist Otto Uldum of Denmark’s Viking Ship Museum, who led the excavation, in a press release.

Medieval Europe’s merchant class was growing in both size and wealth in the early 1400s, and the cog was both a product of that growth and the engine driving it. The mere fact of its existence points to a society that could afford to invest in building big, expensive trading ships (and could confidently expect a return on that investment). And physically, it’s a product of the same trading networks it supplied: while the heavy timbers of its frame were cut locally in the Netherlands, the Pomeranian oak planks of Svaelget 2’s hull came from Poland.

“The cog revolutionized trade in northern Europe,” said Uldum. “It made it possible to transport goods on a scale never seen before.”

For about 600 years, layers of sand had protected the starboard (right, for you landlubbers) side of the wreck from erosion and decay. Nautical archaeologists usually find only the very bottoms of cogs; the upper structures of the ship—rigging, decks, and castles—quickly decay in the ocean. That means that some of the most innovative parts of the ships’ construction appear only in medieval drawings and descriptions.

But Svaelget 2 offers archaeologists a hands-on look at the real deal, from rigging to the ship’s galley and the stern castle: a tall wooden structure at the back of the ship, where crew and passengers could have sought at least a little shelter from the elements. Medieval drawings and texts describe cogs having high castles at both bow and stern, but archaeologists have never gotten to examine a real one to learn how it’s put together or how it connects with the rest of the ship’s construction.

“We have plenty of drawings of castles, but they have never been found because usually only the bottom of the ship survives,” said Uldum. “[The castle] is a big step forward compared to Viking Age ships, which had only open decks in all kinds of weather.”

Lying on and around the remains of the cog’s decks, Uldum and his colleagues also found stays (ropes that would have held the mast in place) and lines for controlling the ship’s single square sail, along with ropes and chains that would once have secured the merchant vessel’s cargo in the open hold.

The cog would probably have sailed with between 30 and 45 crew members. No remains were found on the wreck, but the lost crew left behind small, tantalizing traces of their lives and their presence. Uldum and his colleagues found combs, shoes, and rosary beads, along with dishes and tableware.

“The sailor brought his comb to keep his hair neat and his rosary to say his prayers,” said Uldum (and one has to picture the sailor’s grandmother beaming proudly at that description). “These personal objects show us that the crew brought everyday items with them. They transferred their life on land to life at sea.”

Life at sea, for the medieval sailors aboard Svaelget 2, would have included at least occasional hot meals, cooked in bronze pots over an open fire in the ship’s galley and eaten on dishes of ceramic and painted wood. Bricks (about 200 of them) and tiles formed a sort of fireplace where the cook could safely build a fire aboard the otherwise very flammable ship.

“It speaks of remarkable comfort and organization on board,” said Uldum. “Now sailors could have hot meals similar to those on land, instead of the dried and cold food that previously dominated life at sea.” Plenty of dried meat and cold biscuits still awaited sailors for the next several centuries, of course, but when weather and time permitted, at least the crew of Svaelget 2 could gather around a hot meal. The galley would have been a relatively new part of shipboard life for sailors in the early 1400s—and it quickly became a vital one.

One thing usually marks the site of a shipwreck, even when everything else has disintegrated into the ocean: ballast stones. When merchant ships were empty, they carried stones in their holds to help keep the ship stable; otherwise, the empty ship would be top-heavy and prone to tipping over, which is usually not ideal. (Modern merchant vessels use water, in special tanks, for ballast.) But Uldum and his colleagues didn’t find ballast stones on Svaelget 2, which means the cog was probably fully laden with cargo when it sank.

But the cargo is also conspicuously absent. Cogs were built to carry bulk goods—things like bricks, grain and other staple foods, fabric, salt, and timber. Those goods would have been stowed in an open hold amidships, secured by ropes and chains (some of which remain on the wreck). But barrels, boards, and bolts of fabric all float. As the ship sank and water washed into the hold, it would have carried away the cargo.

Some of it may have washed up on the shores or even more distant beaches, becoming a windfall for local residents. The rest probably sank to the bottom of the sea, far from the ship and its destination.</div>

            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2026/01/judge-orders-annas-archive-to-delete-scraped-data-no-one-thinks-it-will-comply/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The operator of WorldCat won a default judgment against Anna’s Archive, with a federal judge ruling yesterday that the shadow library must delete all copies of its WorldCat data and stop scraping, using, storing, or distributing the data.

Anna’s Archive is a shadow library and search engine for other shadow libraries that was launched in 2022. It archives books and other written materials and makes them available via torrents, and recently expanded its ambitions by scraping Spotify to make a 300TB copy of the most-streamed songs. Anna’s Archive lost its .org domain a couple of weeks ago but remains online at other domains.

Yesterday’s ruling is in a case filed by OCLC, a nonprofit that operates the WorldCat library catalog on behalf of member libraries. OCLC alleged that Anna’s Archive “illegally hacked WorldCat.org” to steal 2.2TB of data.

Anna’s Archive, which bills itself as “the world’s largest shadow library,” did not respond to the lawsuit and doesn’t seem likely to comply with the judgment. The shadow library creator has written that “we deliberately violate the copyright law in most countries. This allows us to do something that legal entities cannot do: making sure books are mirrored far and wide.”

But the court order has value for OCLC, which said in a November 2025 motion that it “hopes to take the judgment to website hosting services so that OCLC’s WorldCat data will be removed from Anna’s Archive’s websites.” We contacted OCLC about its plans today and will update this article if it provides any information.

The court order, which was previously reported by TorrentFreak, was issued by Judge Michael Watson in US District Court for the Southern District of Ohio. “Plaintiff has established that Defendant crashed its website, slowed it, and damaged the servers, and Defendant admitted to the same by way of default,” the ruling said.

Anna’s Archive allegedly began scraping and harvesting data from WorldCat.org in October 2022, “and Plaintiff suffered persistent attacks for roughly a year,” the ruling said. “To accomplish such scraping and harvesting, Defendant allegedly used search bots (automated software applications) that ‘called or pinged the server directly’ and appeared to be ‘legitimate search engine bots from Bing and Google.’”

The court granted OCLC’s motion for default judgment on a breach-of-contract claim related to WorldCat.org terms and conditions, and a trespass-to-chattels claim related to the alleged harm to its website and servers. The court rejected the plaintiff’s tortious-interference-with-contract claim because OCLC’s allegation didn’t include all necessary components to prove the charge, and rejected OCLC’s unjust enrichment claim because it “is preempted by federal copyright law.”

The judgment said Anna’s Archive is permanently enjoined from “scraping or harvesting WorldCat data from WorldCat. org or OCLC’s servers; using, storing, or distributing the WorldCat data on Anna’s Archive’s websites; and encouraging others to scrape, harvest, use, store, or distribute WorldCat data.” It also must “delete all copies of WorldCat data in possession of or easily accessible to it, including all torrents.”

The “Anna” behind Anna’s Archive revealed the WorldCat scraping in an October 2023 blog post. The post said that because WorldCat has “the world’s largest library metadata collection,” the data would help Anna’s Archive make a “list of books that need to be preserved.”

“Even though OCLC is a nonprofit, their business model requires protecting their database,” Anna wrote. “Well, we’re sorry to say, friends at OCLC, we’re giving it all away.”

Anna’s blog said the scraping took place over a year and relied on security flaws that were gradually patched. The “security flaws were slowly fixed one by one, until the final one we found was patched about a month ago,” the October 2023 post said. “By that time we had pretty much all records, and were only going for slightly higher quality records.”

OCLC filed its lawsuit in January 2024. “Beginning in the fall of 2022, OCLC began experiencing cyberattacks on WorldCat.org and OCLC’s servers that significantly affected the speed and operations of WorldCat.org, other OCLC products and services, and OCLC’s servers and network infrastructure,” the lawsuit said. “These attacks continued throughout the following year, forcing OCLC to devote significant time and resources toward non-routine network infrastructure enhancements, maintenance, and troubleshooting.”

OCLC finally learned the perpetrator was Anna’s Archive when the shadow library made its October 2023 announcement. “Anna’s Archive has since made OCLC’s WorldCat data available for en masse for free download and now is actively encouraging its visitors to make use of the data in ‘interesting’ ways,” the lawsuit said, adding that the defendants “have no legal justification for their actions and admit that their general operations violate US and other jurisdictions’ copyright laws.”

Yesterday’s default judgment is not the end of proceedings in the case. OCLC was ordered to file a status report within 30 days “suggesting next steps on the claims for which the Court denied default judgment, unless it files a motion to dismiss its remaining claims against Defendant before then.”</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">How’s a literal nuclear bunker hanging off the side of a crumbling cliff face for portent symbols of how our society seems to be teetering on the edge of some imminent catastrophe? Not good enough for you? Well, it’s what we’ve got.

The brick building, located near Tunstall on the East Yorkshire coast in the UK, is thought to have been built way back in 1959 as a lookout post in the event of a nuclear war. But it’s now just days away from falling into the sea, the BBC reports, as coastal erosion eats away at the cliff top it’s lodged in.

The state of the bunker is so precarious that the East Riding of Yorkshire Council has asked locals to stay clear of the area both at the top of the cliff and below the bunker, in case of a collapse.

“We live on one of the most eroded coastlines in Europe and this bunker hasn’t got long left, perhaps just a few days,” Davey Robinson, an amateur historian who is filming the bunker’s final days, told the BBC.

At the time of reporting on Tuesday, Robinson said he and his partner have visited the Tunstall site every morning for the past nine days. “We are posting the footage on our YouTube channel and it’s getting interest from around the world,” Robinson said.

The bunker, officially known as the Tunstall Royal Observer Corps Post, is a relic of Cold War era paranoia. According to Robinson, “it was designed so that people could live inside it and just wait for a nuclear explosion to register and they could tell other people in other bunkers around the country.”

Today, however, “it’s a symbol of erosion in this area.”

To an extent, coastal erosion is a natural and inevitable process, but geologists believe it’s being accelerated by rising sea levels from global warming. As it stands, around 17 percent of the UK’s over 10,000 miles of coastline is being affected by erosion — and it’s being deeply felt in communities like Tunstall.

“This whole area is eroding at a rapid rate and to see an actual physical thing moving it just shows what’s happening really,” Robinson told the BBC.

            <h2>Scientists Just Discovered Something Horrid About Those Disposable Coffee Cups You’ve Been Slurping</h2>
            <p><strong>Futurism | 2026-01-18</strong></p>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">According to a wealth of recent scientific literature, microplastics, tiny pieces of debris anywhere from one micrometer to five millimeters in size, are absolutely everywhere in nature. They’ve even seemingly invaded our bodies, with studies finding them inside our arteries, reproductive organs, and brains.

It’s hard to even grapple with everything that exposes you to plastic on a daily basis. And now we’ve got one more: according to a new study published in the aptly-named Journal of Hazardous Materials: Plastics, Griffith University research fellow Xiangyu Liu and his colleagues found that common containers, including those ubiquitous disposable coffee cups, could be releasing vast amounts of microplastics as they heat up — a thing that happens every time a hot beverage is poured into them.

“As the temperature of the liquid inside a container increases, the release of microplastics generally increases too,” Liu noted in an essay about the work for The Conversation.

After conducting an initial meta-analysis of 30 peer-reviewed studies, they found that the “releases [of microplastics] ranged from a few hundred particles to more than eight million particles per liter, depending on the material and study design.”

Then they took matters into their own hands. In an experiment involving 400 coffee cups and liquids at various temperatures ranging from iced (41 degrees Fahrenheit) to hot (140 degrees Fahrenheit), they found that temperature indeed had an immense effect on the amount of microplastics being released.

Leaving the drink to sit for hours appeared to have far less of an effect than the “initial temperature of the liquid when it first hits the plastic.” Paper cups with plastic liners released fewer microplastics than all-plastic cups, they found, regardless of temperature.

The researchers found that drinking just ten ounces of hot coffee out of all-plastic cups could result in the drinker ingesting 363,000 pieces of microplastic particles a year.

While that may sound alarming, there are some important caveats to the findings that should be considered before giving up your morning bodega coffee habit for good. For one, as Liu pointed out in his Conversation essay, we don’t know how long microplastics actually remain in the human body.

Accurately measuring how many of the particles are present in our bodies has proven extremely difficult as well. Case in point, just earlier this week, The Guardian published an investigation casting serious doubt on recent studies about the detection of microplastics throughout the human body. Experts noted that they could be the result of contamination, triggering a major debate over the legitimacy of the findings.

In other words, many of the alarming studies we’ve come across may be false positives, further highlighting how much there still is to learn about microplastics and health.

“This is really forcing us to reevaluate everything we think we know about microplastics in the body,” chemist Roger Kuhlman told The Guardian. “Which, it turns out, is really not very much. Many researchers are making extraordinary claims, but not providing even ordinary evidence.”

Nonetheless, Liu opined that as we await more clarity on the situation, “it’s good to be aware of potential microplastic sources in our daily lives.”

The researcher also offered some tips to ensure our coffee shop habits won’t negatively impact our health in the long run.

“For hot drinks, the best option is to use a reusable cup made of stainless steel, ceramic, or glass, as these materials do not shed microplastics,” he wrote. “If we must use a disposable cup, our research suggests that plastic-lined paper cups generally shed fewer particles than pure plastic cups, though neither is microplastic free.”

Liu also noted that “since heat is the factor that triggers plastic release, avoid putting boiling liquids directly into plastic-lined containers.”

“By understanding how heat and material choice interact, we can design better products and make better choices for our daily caffeine fix,” he concluded.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">These days, AI surveillance systems are everywhere. They’re watching our roads, tracking our purchases at the grocery store, and even monitoring school bathrooms.

Yet those systems come with a harmful catch — they’re a little too good at flagging bad behavior, leading to a staggering number of arrests and involuntary detentions.

New reporting by the Milwaukee Independent found that schools deploying surveillance systems to watch for online chatter referencing violence have logged an astonishing number of positive hits. Many of them are obviously not actionable threats, though they can lead to involuntary detention all the same.

In one school district in Lawrence, Kansas, for example, an online safety monitoring tool called Gaggle flagged over 1,200 online incidents over a 10-month period. Yet two thirds of those alerts were nonissues, the Independent found.

While many false positives can be waved away, schools in states with zero-tolerance reporting laws like Tennessee or Florida are required to inform police officials about cases where students hint at violence in any form.

In Florida’s Polk County School District — where Gaggle flagged some 500 students over four years — this meant that at least 72 kids so far have been arrested or hospitalized involuntarily under the state’s Baker Act.

“A really high number of children who experience involuntary examination remember it as a really traumatic and damaging experience — not something that helps them with their mental health care,” Sam Boyd, an attorney with the Southern Poverty Law Center, told the Independent.

Many of those students don’t even realize their emails, online chats, and Google searches on school equipment are being monitored, let alone that they’ve done anything wrong. Tennessee mother Lesley Mathis, for example, told the Independent her eighth-grade daughter was arrested, interrogated, strip-searched, and held in jail for a night, over some teasing online.

Specifically, the student’s friends had heckled her about her “Mexican” complexion, even though she has a different ancestry. “On Thursday we kill all the Mexico’s [sic],” the eighth-grader quipped back.

Those comments are obviously very nasty — but it was clearly a bit of eighth-grade immaturity boiling over, not an actionable threat.

“It made me feel like, is this the America we live in?” Mathis said. “And it was this stupid, stupid technology that is just going through picking up random words and not looking at context.”

In the United States, studies show that youth who experience juvenile detention — even for short periods of time, like in pre-trial custody — experience worse development outcomes later in life compared to their peers. These include higher rates of adult incarceration, lower rates of full-time employment, and poorer health during adulthood.

Still, some school administrators feel that’s a risk worth taking — though there’s little evidence suggesting surveillance tech is actually lowering the levels of violence in American schools. As Lawrence school board member Anne Costello said in a 2024 board meeting: “Sometimes you have to look at the trade for the greater good.”

            <div id="article-text">Elon Musk’s Tesla would never get special treatment by the US government, right?

This week, Ars Technica reports, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration told the EV automaker that it would get another five weeks to comply with an order to fork over data for a probe into the safety of its self-driving technology.

The investigation, launched last October, covers nearly three million Tesla vehicles installed with the automaker’s misleadingly named “Full Self-Driving” mode — which is in reality only partially self-driving — after receiving nearly 60 reports of the software violating traffic laws. Fourteen of these incidents involved crashes, totaling 23 injuries. In six of the crashes, the driving software “approached an intersection with a red traffic signal, continued to travel into the intersection against the red light and was subsequently involved in a crash with other motor vehicles in the intersection,” according to an NHTSA complaint.

The original deadline for providing data related to these incidents was set at January 19, with potential penalties up to $27,874 per day of being late, for a maximum of $139.4 million. But in part because the winter holidays cut into that time a little bit — and with Tesla being inundated with other investigation’s requests into its self-driving tech’s safety record — the automaker asked to extend the deadline. Evidently, its pleas fell on sympathetic ears: it now has until February 23 to make good.

And to be fair to the Musk outfit, it’s being asked to provide a lot of information. Per Ars, the NHTSA’s Office of Defects Investigation informed the automaker on December 3 that it would need a list of every Tesla produced sold, or leased, in the US, whether those cars had FSD — plus cumulative data showing how many US Teslas have FSD and how often it’s used, along with documents like customer complaints, incident reports, and lawsuits related to FSD ignoring traffic laws.

Yet, on the other hand, it’s a questionable amount of leeway to be giving a company that the NHTSA has already investigated for repeatedly failing to report crashes on time. It should also be concerning that Tesla has a shady history when it comes to sharing crash data and working with regulatory deadlines. It’s long heavily censored information about crashes involving Autopilot, Full Self-Driving, and its robotaxis, to the point of rendering the reports virtually useless. The redactions, which are justified as protecting “confidential business information,” include the removal of basic details like crash narrative and when the date the incident occurred. At times, the NHTSA has even redacted crash information at Tesla’s request.

In any case, it’ll add to Tesla’s already pretty full plate. It’s already facing another ongoing NHTSA probe into the troubling phenomenon of FSD driving straight into the path of oncoming trains, and it’s separately being investigated for a horrific crash in which video footage shows FSD’s camera blinded by sunlight before mowing down and killing an elderly pedestrian.

All the while, it’s fighting the outcome of the lawsuit that ordered the automaker to pay $329 million in damages after a jury found it partially guilty for the death of a woman who was killed by a car running Autopilot. Perhaps a ton of paperwork is a light consequence to endure when you deploy unfinished and unsafe “self-driving” tech across millions of cars.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Amid abysmal car sales that continue to plummet worldwide and major regulatory hurdles plaguing the company’s driver assistance software, Tesla CEO Elon Musk is desperately looking to reinvent the company.

His newfound obsession has been Tesla’s Optimus humanoid robot, an invention that he says will transform the EV maker into a $25 trillion robotics company. He’s promised that Optimus will account for the vast majority of the company’s already extremely inflated value — a claim he’s now taking to an extraordinary new extreme.

Responding to a clip of entrepreneur and investor Jason Calacanis claiming during a recent summit that “nobody will remember that Tesla ever made a car” and that “they will only remember” the company building “a billion” Optimus robots, Musk had a sweeping prediction.

Beyond once again demonstrating Musk’s penchant for making vastly exaggerated claims about his companies, the admission neatly summarizes what we’ve suspected for quite some time now: Tesla and Musk are ready to move on from the EV and are looking to capitalize on the next big hype cycle.

Tesla still has a lot to prove when it comes to its bipedal assistant. As part of Musk’s $1 trillion pay package, the company will need to deploy one million Optimus robots, a goal the mercurial CEO has promised could be achieved by 2030.

Reality, however, has plenty of catching up to do. The company has encountered major technical snags in its efforts to build out production lines and reportedly failed to keep up with its own stated goal of building 5,000 Optimus robots last year.

The company’s demos have also fallen far short of expectations, with one robot struggling to walk down a clear office hallway. Tesla is also still heavily relying on teleoperators, suggesting that autonomous operation without the need for a human pilot could still be a long way out.

In short, Musk’s extremely boisterous claims that “Optimus will eliminate poverty and provide universal high income for all” should be taken with a grain of salt.

For now, investors in the EV firm are happily buying into the CEO’s vision. The stock hit an all-time closing high of just shy of $500 in mid-December. That’s despite Tesla still facing declining deliveries and sales as it desperately attempts to reinvent itself as a humanoid robotics company.

            <h2>Scientists Uncover Secret Landscape Hiding Miles Below Antarctica’s Ice</h2>
            <p><strong>Futurism | 2026-01-18</strong></p>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">By creating a new map of Antarctica’s subterranean landscape, researchers have uncovered a vast topography of previously hidden hills, ridges, and even entire mountain ranges lurking miles beneath its frozen exterior.

The findings, detailed in a new study published in the journal Science, could represent a novel method of probing the Antarctic ice that could be instrumental in predicting the frigid continent’s fate amid rapid climate change.

“It’s like before you had a grainy pixel film camera, and now you’ve got a properly zoomed-in digital image of what’s really going on,” lead author Helen Ockenden, a researcher at the University of Grenoble-Alpes in France, told the BBC.

Previous approaches have relied on on-the-ground and aerial missions to use radar to sound out the continent’s subsurface features. But the barren landscape is intimidatingly vast, and these missions can be separated by dozens of miles, leaving scientists with an incomplete picture, which itself can only really guess at what’s trapped below all those miles of ice.

According to an editor’s summary of the study, the Antarctic’s subsurface landscape is so mysterious that we know less about it than we do Mercury. Study coauthor Robert Bingham, a glaciologist at the University of Edinburg, provided an analogy.

“If you imagined the Scottish Highlands or the European Alps were covered by ice and the only way to understand their shape was the occasional flight several kilometers apart,” he told the BBC, “there’s no way that you would see all these sharp mountains and valleys that we know to be there.”

Space provides an alternative. Using a combination of optical images and radar data taken by satellites, and then combining this with models on how subsurface ice flows, Ockenden and her team teased out the undulations in the bedrock underneath the ice, according to Science.

“It’s a little bit like if you’re kayaking in a river, and there’s rocks underneath the water, sometimes there’s eddies in the surface, which can tell you about the rocks under the water,” Ockenden told the BBC. When the ice flows over a ridge or hill the bedrock, “that manifests in the topography of the surface, but also in the velocity as well.”

The novel approach uncovered a far more interesting and heterogeneous landscape than what was suspected before: alpine valleys, eroded lowlands, and a vast network of channels formed by flowing water spanning hundreds of miles.

It isn’t perfect, according to University of Texas at Austin glaciologist Duncan Young, who wasn’t involved in the study. He told Science that the approach can’t pick up features smaller than a few meters across, for which traditional radar approaches will still be the best to uncover.

Still, it provides a good guide for where radar surveys should look.

“We’re not so blind now,” Bingham told Science. “We have a really good impression of where the bed’s quite rough, where you would need to survey closely if you really want to see the details of the features.”

Understanding Antarctica’s buried geography and fluvial networks will be crucial to understanding how its immense reserves of ice will be affected by climate change. Already, scientists predict that the potential collapse of just one of the continent’s ice sheets — connected to the infamous Thwaites or “Doomsday” glacier — could raise sea levels by dozens of feet in the coming centuries. Subterranean happenings turned out to be an alarming development in our understanding of the the Thwaites’ health, when scientists discovered that its bottom side, once thought to be protected by the seabed, was actually being exposed to warming seawater. Similar revelations, with new imaging techniques, could come to bear on our understanding of the continent at large.

            <h2>Sequoia to invest in Anthropic, breaking VC taboo on backing rivals: FT</h2>
            <p><strong>TechCrunch | 2026-01-18</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/18/sequoia-to-invest-in-anthropic-breaking-vc-taboo-on-backing-rivals-ft/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Sequoia Capital is reportedly joining a blockbuster funding round for Anthropic, the AI startup behind Claude, according to the Financial Times. It’s a move sure to turn heads in Silicon Valley.

Why? Because venture capital firms have historically avoided backing competing companies in the same sector, preferring to place their bets on a single winner. Yet here’s Sequoia, already invested in both OpenAI and Elon Musk’s xAI, now throwing its weight behind Anthropic, too.

The timing is particularly surprising given what OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said under oath last year. As part of OpenAI’s defense against Musk’s lawsuit, Altman addressed rumors about restrictions in OpenAI’s 2024 funding round. While he denied that OpenAI investors were broadly prohibited from backing rivals, he did acknowledge that investors with ongoing access to OpenAI’s confidential information were told that access would be terminated “if they made non-passive investments in OpenAI’s competitors.” Altman called this “industry standard” protection (which it is) against misuse of competitively-sensitive information.

According to the FT, Sequoia is joining a funding round led by Singapore’s GIC and U.S. investor Coatue, which are each contributing $1.5 billion. Anthropic is aiming to raise $25 billion or more at a $350 billion valuation — more than double its $170 billion valuation from just four months ago. The WSJ and Bloomberg had earlier reported the round at $10 billion. Microsoft and Nvidia have committed up to $15 billion combined, with VCs and other investors said to be contributing another $10 billion or more.

The Sequoia connection with Altman runs deep. When Altman dropped out of Stanford to start Loopt, Sequoia backed him. He later became a “scout” for Sequoia, introducing the firm to Stripe, which became one of the firm’s most valuable portfolio companies. Sequoia’s new co-leader Alfred Lin and Altman also appear comparatively close. Lin has interviewed Altman numerous times at Sequoia events, and when Altman was briefly ousted from OpenAI in November 2023, Lin publicly said he’d eagerly back Altman’s “next world-changing company.”

While Sequoia’s investment in xAI might seem to have already contradicted the traditional VC approach of picking winners, that bet is widely viewed as less about backing an OpenAI competitor and more about deepening the firm’s extensive ties to Elon Musk. Sequoia invested in X when Musk bought Twitter and rebranded it, is an investor in SpaceX and The Boring Company, and is a major backer of Neuralink, Musk’s brain-computer interface company. Former longtime Sequoia leader Michael Moritz was even an early investor in Musk’s X.com, which became part of PayPal.

Sequoia’s apparent reversal on portfolio conflicts is especially glaring given its historical stance. As we reported in 2020, the firm took the extraordinary step of walking away from its investment in payments company Finix after determining the startup competed with Stripe. Sequoia forfeited its $21 million investment, letting Finix keep the money while giving up its board seat, information rights, and shares, marking the first time in the firm’s history it had severed ties with a newly funded company over a conflict of interest. (Sequoia had led Finix’s $35 million Series B round just months earlier.)

The reported Anthropic investment comes after dramatic leadership changes at Sequoia, where the firm’s global steward, Roelof Botha, was forced aside in a surprise vote this fall just days after sitting down with this editor at TechCrunch Disrupt, with Lin and Pat Grady — who’d led that Finix deal — taking over.

Anthropic is reportedly preparing for an IPO that could come as soon as this year. We’ve reached out to Sequoia Capital for comment.

It’s been a minute, folks! As you might recall, the newsletter took a little holiday break. We’re back and well into 2026. And a lot has happened since the last edition.

I spent the first week of the year at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas. And while I wrote about this last January, it’s worth repeating: U.S. automakers have left the building.

What has filled the void in the Las Vegas Convention Center? Autonomous vehicle tech companies (Zoox, Tensor Auto, Tier IV, and Waymo, which rebranded its Zeekr RT, to name a few), Chinese automakers like Geely and GWM, software and automotive chip companies, and loads of what Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang calls “physical AI.”

The term, which is sometimes called “embodied AI,” describes the use of AI outside the digital world and into the real, physics-based one. AI models, combined with sensors, cameras, and the motorized controls, allow that physical thing — humanoid robot, drone, autonomous forklift, robotaxi — to detect and understand what’s in this real environment and make decisions to operate within it. And it was all over the place from agriculture and robotics to autonomous vehicles and drones, industrial manufacturing, and wearables.

Hyundai had one of the busiest and largest exhibits with a near-constant line wrapped around the entrance. The Korean automaker wasn’t showing cars. Nope, it was robots of various forms, including the Atlas humanoid robot, courtesy of its subsidiary Boston Dynamics. There were also innovations that have come out of Hyundai Motor Group Robotics LAB, including a robot that charges electric autonomous vehicles, and a four-wheel electric platform called the Mobile Eccentric Droid (MobEd) that is going into production this year. It seems everyone was embracing and showcasing robotics, particularly humanoids.

The hype around humanoids, specifically, and physical AI, in general, was palpable. I asked Mobileye co-founder and president Amnon Shashua about this because his company just bought his humanoid robotics startup for $900 million: “What do you say when people tell you humanoid robots are all hype?”

“The internet was also a hype, remember in 2000, the crisis of the internet,” Shashua said. “It did not mean that [the] internet is not a real thing. Hype means that companies are overvalued for a certain period of time, and then they crash. It does not mean that the domain is not real. I believe that the domain of humanoids is real.”

Now onto the other non-CES and more recent news …

President Trump made comments this week at a Detroit Economic Club meeting about welcoming Chinese automakers into the United States that did not sit well with many in the auto industry, according to insiders I have spoken to. Specifically, I have been told the Alliance for Automotive Innovation (the industry lobbying group) is “freaking out,” one DC insider told me.

“If they want to come in and build a plant and hire you and hire your friends and your neighbors, that’s great, I love that,” Trump said, according to reporters in attendance. “Let China come in, let Japan come in.”

A couple of notes. Japanese companies like Toyota are already very much in the United States. The bigger hurdle, beyond protests from within the boardrooms of U.S. automakers, is existing law. In 2025, the U.S. Department of Commerce’s Bureau of Industry and Security issued a rule that restricts the import and sale of certain connected vehicles and related hardware and software linked to China or Russia. This essentially bans the sale of Chinese vehicles in the country.

Avery Ash, who is CEO of SAFE, a nonpartisan organization focused on securing U.S. energy, critical materials, and supply chains, weighed in about the dangers of allowing Chinese automakers to sell their vehicles in the United States. Side note: Ash was on my podcast, the Autonocast, which touches on some of this subject.

“Welcoming Chinese automakers to build cars here in the U.S. will reverse these hard-won accomplishments and put Americans at risk,” he said. ”We’ve seen this strategy backfire in Europe and elsewhere — it would have potentially catastrophic impacts on our automotive industry, have ripple effects on our entire defense industrial base, and make every American less secure.”

Meanwhile, Canada is opening the door to Chinese automakers. Canadian prime minister Mark Carney announced his country will slash its 100% import tax on Chinese EVs to just 6.1%, Sean O’Kane reports.

Budget carrier Allegiant agreed to buy rival Sun Country Airlines for about $1.5 billion in cash and stock.

Dealerware, which sells software services to automotive OEMs and retailers, was acquired by a group of investors led by Wavecrest Growth Partners and Radian Capital. Automotive Ventures and automotive industry executives David Metter and Devin Daly also participated. The terms were not disclosed.

Long-distance bus and train provider Flix acquired the majority share of European airport transfer-platform Flibco. Luxembourg company SLG will retain some ownership stake in Flibco. Terms weren’t disclosed.

JetZero, the Long Beach, California, startup developing a midsized triangular aircraft designed to save on fuel, raised $175 million in a Series B round led by B Capital, Bloomberg reported.

Joby Aviation, a company developing electric air taxis, reached an agreement to buy a 700,000-square-foot manufacturing facility in Dayton, Ohio, to support its plans to double production to four aircraft per month in 2027.

Luminar has reached a deal to sell its lidar business to a company called Quantum Computing Inc. for just $22 million. If that seems low, you’re right. Luminar’s valuation peaked in 2021 at $11 billion.

Bluspark Global, a New York-based shipping and supply chain software company, didn’t realize its platform was vulnerable and open to anyone on the internet. Here’s how a security researcher (and TechCrunch) got it fixed.

The Federal Trade Commission finalized an order that bans General Motors and its OnStar telematics service from sharing certain consumer data with consumer reporting agencies. Read the full story on what that means.

InDrive, the company that started as a ride-hailing platform that lets users set the price, is diversifying and starting to execute on its “super app” strategy. That means more in-app advertising across its top 20 markets and expanding grocery delivery to Pakistan. Read the full story here.

Motional, the majority Hyundai-owned autonomous vehicle company, has rebooted. When Motional paused its operations last year, I wasn’t sure it was going to survive. Other AV companies with big backers have seen their funding disappear in a blink, so it was certainly plausible. But the company is here and with a new AI-first approach. Before you roll your eyes at that term, take a read of my article, which includes a demo ride and an interview with CEO Laura Major. Then feel free to hit my inbox with your thoughts.

New York governor Kathy Hochul plans to introduce legislation that would effectively legalize robotaxis in the state with the exception of New York City. No details on this yet; I’ve been told it will all be revealed in her executive budget proposal next week. What we do know is the proposal is designed to expand the state’s existing AV pilot program to allow for “the limited deployment of commercial for-hire autonomous passenger vehicles outside New York City.” My article delves deeper into what she shared and gives an update on Waymo’s NYC permit.

Tesla is ditching the one-time fee option for its Full Self-driving (Supervised) software and will now sell access to the feature through a monthly subscription.

On-demand drone delivery company Wing is bringing its service to another 150 Walmart stores as part of an expanded partnership with the retailer.

            <p><strong>TechCrunch | 2026-01-18</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/18/threads-edges-out-x-in-daily-mobile-users-new-data-shows/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">A report from market intelligence firm Similarweb suggests that Meta’s Threads is now seeing more daily usage than Elon Musk’s X on mobile devices. While X still dominates Threads on the web, the Threads mobile app for iOS and Android has continued to see an increase in daily active users over the past several months.

Similarweb’s data shows that Threads had 141.5 million daily active users on iOS and Android as of January 7, 2026, after months of growth, while X has 125 million daily active users on mobile devices.

This appears to be the result of longer-term trends, rather than a reaction to the recent X controversies, where users were discovered using the platform’s integrated AI, Grok, to create non-consensual nude images of women, including, sometimes minors. Concern around the deepfake images has now prompted California’s attorney general to open an investigation into Grok, following similar investigations by other regions, like the UK, EU, India, Brazil, and many more.

The drama on X also led social networking startup Bluesky to see an increase in app installs in recent days.

Instead, Threads’ boost in daily mobile usage may be driven by other factors, including cross-promotions from Meta’s larger social apps like Facebook and Instagram (where Threads is regularly advertised to existing users), its focus on creators, and the rapid rollout of new features. Over the past year, Threads has added features like interest-based communities, better filters, DMs, long-form text, disappearing posts, and has recently been spotted testing games.

Combined, the daily active user increases suggest that more people are using Threads on mobile as a more regular habit.

According to Meta’s official numbers, the tech giant said in August 2025 that Threads had reached over 400 million monthly active users. The company subsequently reported in October of last year that Threads had 150 million daily active users.

The growth trends have been continuing for many months. Similarweb last summer reported that Threads was closing the gap with X on mobile devices after seeing 127.8% year-over-year growth as of late June 2025.

Relatedly, Similarweb observed that X is still ahead of Threads in the U.S., but the gap is narrowing. A year ago, X had twice as many daily active users in the U.S. as it does now.

In addition, Threads has little traction on the web while X maintains a fairly steady web audience with around 150 million daily web visits, according to Similarweb data. As of earlier this week (January 13), X was seeing 145.4 million daily web visits, while Threads saw 8.5 million daily web visits across Threads.com and Threads.net combined.

“It was… it was tight,” he said with a laugh on the show floor.

It took 12 hours driving in the rain, but the gear – and Puchalski – made it safely to Las Vegas, and so began the young company’s first-ever CES.

San Francisco-based Bucket Robotics was just one of thousands of companies exhibiting at the annual tech conference, a speck of sand on a beach full of products and promises. But despite its modest setup in the automotive-focused West Hall, Puchalski said the trip was worth it.

Part of that was a willingness to be tireless, observant, and always ready to pitch.

An engineer by trade, Puchalski spent most of the last decade working on autonomous vehicles at Uber, Argo AI, Ford’s subsidiary Latitude AI, and SoftBank-backed Stack AV.

At those jobs, Puchalski developed deep connections in the automotive industry, and we crossed paths all week.

There he was at an industry networking party one night. On another night, in my hotel lobby at 10 p.m., he was debating how to balance quality and manufacturing yield with Sanjay Dastoor — founder of mobility startups Skip and Boosted, both of which also got off the ground at YC.

But I first ran into Puchalski during breakfast at the hotel. Seated at the table next to me, he and sales associate Max Joseph were running through preparations for the conference’s “Media Day” over (allegedly) cage-free eggs.

Puchalski’s verve piqued my interest, and after making an intro, he told me what Bucket Robotics is up to. Before I knew it, he had cracked open a bright yellow Pelican case and I was holding a small piece of plastic.

Started as part of YC’s Spring 2024 batch, Bucket Robotics is all about using advanced vision systems to do quality inspections, specifically for surfaces. The goal is to automate a menial task that Puchalski joked is usually done by “dudes in Wisconsin,” and to accelerate the broad, multi-industry effort to onshore manufacturing.

One example Puchalski offered was car door handles. It’s a part customers touch every day, so it needs to be structurally sound, and that kind of quality inspection is basically solved.

But it can be challenging to make sure the surface is flawless. Is the color right? Are there any burn or scuff marks? These are the questions Bucket Robotics wants to answer.

“It’s deeply hard to automate these types of challenges without huge volumes of data, so auto manufacturers just throw dudes in Wisconsin at this problem,” he said.

Bucket Robotics solves that data problem by working from the CAD files for a particular part. It then generates a bunch of simulated defects – burn marks, bumps, breaks – so that its vision software can detect those problems quickly on a production line.

There’s no need for manual labeling, and the company claims its models can deploy “in minutes” while also adapting if products or production lines change. One of the big selling points to date is that Bucket Robotics can integrate into existing production lines without adding new hardware, Puchalski said.

This has already attracted customers in automotive and in defense, setting up Bucket Robotics to pursue the increasingly popular path of becoming a “dual-use” company.

When the show floor opened, the first two hours were “intense,” Puchalski said. Attendees in suits snooped around the startup’s tables, plucked orange stickers with the Bucket Robotics logo, and quizzed the employees about their tech.

More importantly, Puchalski said the level of interest stayed consistent throughout the week. He had “real technical discussions” with people from the worlds of manufacturing, robotics, and automation. He said Friday that he’s spent the week since the show on follow-up calls with prospective customers and investors.

CES can be a slog, but Bucket Robotics survived. Now comes the actual hard part: building a business, scaling, fundraising, and striking commercial deals.

As for the “dudes in Wisconsin,” Puchalski doesn’t see his company as a threat to their livelihoods. Those jobs are just as much about spotting defects as they are about identifying the root cause of the problem, he said.

And besides, Puchalski added, automating surface quality inspection is something that the manufacturing industry has been trying to do for decades.

“So when we go to our customers, it’s incredibly exciting,” he said.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">If you’re at all concerned about privacy, the rise of AI personal assistants can feel alarming. It’s difficult to use one without sharing personal information, which is retained by the model’s parent company. With OpenAI already testing advertising, it’s easy to imagine the same data collection that fuels Facebook and Google creeping into your chatbot conversations.

A new project, launched in December by Signal co-founder Moxie Marlinspike, is showing what a privacy-conscious AI service might look like. Confer is designed to look and feel like ChatGPT or Claude, but the backend is arranged to avoid data collection, with the open-source rigor that makes Signal so trusted. Your Confer conversations can’t be used to train the model or target ads, for the simple reason that the host will never have access to them.

For Marlinspike, those protections are a response to the intimate nature of the service.

“It’s a form of technology that actively invites confession,” says Marlinspike. “Chat interfaces like ChatGPT know more about people than any other technology before. When you combine that with advertising, it’s like someone paying your therapist to convince you to buy something.”

Ensuring that privacy requires several different systems working in concert.

First, Confer encrypts messages to and from the system using the WebAuthn passkey system. (Unfortunately, that standard works best on mobile devices or Macs running Sequoia, although you can also make it work on Windows or Linux with a password manager.) On the server side, all Confer’s inference processing is done in a Trusted Execution Environment (TEE), with remote attestation systems in place to verify the system hasn’t been compromised. Inside that, there’s an array of open-weight foundation models handling whatever query comes in.

The result is a lot more complicated than a standard inference setup (which is fairly complicated already), but it delivers on Confer’s basic promise to users. As long as those protections are in place, you can have sensitive conversations with the model without any information leaking out.

Confer’s free tier is limited to 20 messages a day and five active chats. Users willing to pay $35 a month will get unlimited access, along with more advanced models and personalization. That’s quite a bit more than ChatGPT’s Plus plan — but privacy doesn’t come cheap.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">If you’ve been following the billionaire exodus from California with some confusion, here’s what’s actually driving the nervousness: it’s not the 5% rate. As highlighted Friday in the New York Post, the proposed wealth tax would hit founders on their voting shares rather than the actual equity they own.

Take Larry Page, who about 3% of Google but controls roughly 30% of its voting power through dual-class stock. Under this proposal, he’d owe taxes on that 30%. For a company valued in the hundreds of billions, that’s a lot more than a rounding error. The Post reports that one SpaceX alumni founder building grid technology would face a tax bill at the Series B stage of the company that would wipe out his entire holdings.

David Gamage, the University of Missouri law professor who helped craft the proposal, thinks Silicon Valley is overreacting. “I don’t understand why the billionaires just aren’t calling good tax lawyers,” he told The San Francisco Standard this week. Gamage insists founders wouldn’t be forced to sell. Those with most of their wealth in private stock could open a deferral account for assets they don’t want taxed immediately — California would instead take 5% whenever those shares are eventually sold. “If your startup fails, you pay nothing,” he explained. “But if your startup is the next Google, you’re giving California a share of your gamble.” He also said founders could submit alternative valuations from certified appraisers reflecting what shares could actually sell for, rather than being stuck with the default voting-control formula.

But that’s pretty small consolation. For startups that aren’t publicly traded, calculating valuations is “inherently difficult,” tax expert Jared Walczak told the Post. “These are not clear cut—you could come to a very different conclusion not because of dishonesty.” And if the state disagrees with your appraisal, it’s not just the company on the hook; the state can also penalize the person who calculated the valuation. Even with alternative appraisals, founders would still face enormous tax bills on control they hold but wealth they haven’t realized.

Now, if you’ve been under a rock: California’s health care union is pushing a ballot initiative for a one-time 5% tax on anyone worth over $1 billion. The union argues it’s necessary to offset the deep cuts to health care that President Trump signed into law last year, including slashes to Medicaid and ACA subsidies. As originally envisioned, they expect to raise about $100 billion from roughly 200 individuals and the tax would apply retroactively to anyone living in California as of January 1, 2026.

But the resistance is fierce and bipartisan. As reported last weekend by the WSJ, Silicon Valley elite have formed a Signal chat called “Save California” that includes everyone from Trump’s crypto czar David Sacks to Kamala Harris mega-donor Chris Larsen. They’ve called the proposal “Communism” and “poorly defined.” Some are taking just-in-case measures, too, with Larry Page reportedly dropping $173.4 million on two Miami waterfront properties across last month and the first week of the new year, and one of Peter Thiel’s firms leasing Miami office space last month. (Thiel has had ties to Miami for years — including a home — but an uncharacteristic press release about this new office was seemingly meant to send a message.)

Even Governor Gavin Newsom is fighting it. “This will be defeated, there’s no question in my mind,” he told the New York Times this week, adding that he’d been “relentlessly working behind the scenes” against the proposal. “I’ll do what I have to do to protect the state.”

For now, the union isn’t backing down. “We’re simply trying to keep emergency rooms open and save patient lives,” said executive committee member Debru Carthan to the Journal last weekend. “The few who left have shown the world just how outrageously greedy they truly are.”

The proposal needs 875,000 signatures to make November’s ballot, where it would need a simple majority to pass.

            <h2>Harris’s Staff Questioned Whether Josh Shapiro Was an Israeli Double Agent</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-01-19</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/2026/01/josh-shapiro-kamala-harris-israel/685674/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro was already irritated by what he describes as “unnecessarily contentious” questions from the team vetting him to be Kamala Harris’s running mate when a senior aide made one final inquiry: “Have you ever been an agent of the Israeli government?”

The question came from President Biden’s former White House counsel Dana Remus, who was a key member of Harris’s vice-presidential search team.

Shapiro, one of the most well-known Jewish elected officials in the country—and one of at least three Jewish politicians considering a run for the 2028 Democratic presidential nomination—says he took umbrage at the question. “Had I been a double agent for Israel? Was she kidding? I told her how offensive the question was,” Shapiro writes in his forthcoming book, Where We Keep the Light, a copy of which The Atlantic obtained ahead of its release on January 27.  The exchange became even more tense, he writes, when Remus asked whether Shapiro had ever spoken with an undercover Israeli agent. The questions left the governor feeling uneasy about the prospect of being Harris’s No. 2, a role that ultimately went to Minnesota Governor Tim Walz. After Harris and Walz lost to Donald Trump, many Democrats were critical of her decision to bypass Shapiro, the popular governor of the nation’s largest swing state. In his book, Shapiro says that the decision may not have been fully hers; he says he had “a knot in my stomach” throughout a vetting process that was more combative than he had expected. Shapiro wrote that he decided to take his name out of the running after a one-on-one meeting with Harris that featured more clashes, including about Israel.

The account highlights some of the fault lines that Democrats are navigating as they try to put the 2024 campaign behind them and chart a path back to the White House. With his book, Shapiro aims to showcase why Democrats lost and how his brand of consensus-building politics can usher them back to power. But before the consensus building, it seems, Shapiro felt compelled to do some score settling.

Harris, after all, had written a surprisingly candid account of her truncated and, ultimately, tortured selection process for a running mate, and it did not make Shapiro look good. When my colleague Tim Alberta first informed Shapiro of Harris’s description of their meeting in her book, 107 Days, he grew uncharacteristically sharp-tongued. “That’s complete and utter bullshit,” he told Alberta. “I can tell you that her accounts are just blatant lies.” Shapiro is more measured in Where We Keep the Light, taking pains not to attack Harris herself and instead blaming her staff for probing him in a way that at times felt gratuitous.  “Remus was just doing her job,” Shapiro wrote about the Israeli-spy inquiry. “I get it. But the fact that she asked, or was told to ask that question by someone else, said a lot about some of the people around the VP.” (Remus and an aide to Harris did not respond to a request for comment.) In a statement, Shapiro’s spokesperson Manuel Bonder didn’t address the apparently unpleasant vetting process, and would only say that the governor had written “a very personal book” about his faith, his family, and what he has learned from a career of public service. He said the 2024 election was “one small part” of Shapiro’s “much broader story.”

Shapiro does not write about the vice-presidential search until near the end of his book, which otherwise serves up the standard fare of a pre-campaign-launch political memoir, tracing his rise from a childhood in suburban Philadelphia to the governorship of the nation’s fifth-most-populous state. Shapiro writes about the importance of his Jewish faith, his role pursuing justice for survivors of sexual abuse in the Catholic Church, his admiration for—and early support of—President Obama, and the astute political instincts of his wife and adviser, Lori.

The book opens with the harrowing firebombing of the governor’s mansion on Passover last year by a man who later told prosecutors that he blamed Shapiro for the deaths of Palestinians in Gaza. Shapiro and his family had to flee the home, which suffered significant damage from the fire, in the middle of the night after being alerted by a state trooper. The governor writes that his willingness to publicly embrace his Jewish faith before and after the attack has been welcomed by people of various religious backgrounds, suggesting that his experience as part of an observant Jewish family would be a prominent part of any run for the presidency.

Where We Keep the Light is typical of the sort of memoir that candidates release before running for president. In it, Shapiro extols the virtues of using politics to improve people’s lives. He also makes subtle but clear policy distinctions between himself and other prominent members of his party, including some eyeing the party’s presidential nomination.

He gets ahead of some of the major questions that Democrats are likely to face in the 2028 primary, writing, for example, that he would have handled coronavirus lockdowns differently, that he did not support the defund-the-police rhetoric in the summer of 2020, and that he privately suggested to Biden that he should consider dropping out of the presidential race after an abysmal debate performance against Trump. He also defends his support for cutting taxes and his more permissive stance on fossil fuels, policies that put him outside the mainstream of the Democratic political class. He writes that anti-Semitism has become “much scarier, much more real” in recent years and suggests a clear distinction between free speech and protest activity that veers into intimidation.

But the governor also devotes several pages to providing his side of the story from the 2024 search for a vice-presidential candidate, after Harris wrote a detailed account of the traditionally secretive process, which included a less-than-warm meeting with Shapiro.

Their sit-down on August 4, 2024, took place shortly after Shapiro got off the phone with Remus, telling her that he had no way of knowing if he had ever communicated with an undercover Israeli agent.

Harris wrote that before they met at the Naval Observatory, Shapiro asked staff there about how many bedrooms the compound had and whether the Smithsonian might loan him art to decorate the place. The unmistakable implication was that the governor, seen by some Democrats as an ambitious operator with his eye on the presidency, was already measuring the drapes before being selected for the No. 2 role. Shapiro, not surprisingly, offers a different take, writing that his brief discussion with staff from the residence was only “small talk” that had been “analyzed, misrepresented, and picked apart by members of the vice president’s team.”

After Harris and Shapiro sat down, in a dining room that had been cleared of most furniture other than two chairs and a table, there was little in the way of small talk or pleasantries. Each described the conversation as blunt, lacking the traditional warmth of two people trying to determine if a four-year partnership would work. Their discussion was especially tense when Harris asked Shapiro if he would apologize for some of his comments about protesters at the University of Pennsylvania who had built encampments to decry Israel’s military campaign in Gaza and, in some cases, intimidated Jewish students.  Shapiro wrote that he “flatly” told Harris that he would not. It was one of several times he claims that he had to stand his ground after Harris’s team brought up issues on which he had taken a different stance from hers and asked if he would be willing to apologize or otherwise make a public about-face.

Shapiro wrote that he understood the campaign’s desire to probe his background and policy positions, but “didn’t see anything wrong with not aligning perfectly” with Harris on all issues, adding that “they weren’t going to expand her universe by doing the exact same thing that she had been doing all these years.”

He told Harris’s team that he respected their role and was submitting willingly to the vetting process, but he was “not going to apologize for who I am or for the positions I’ve taken over the years.”

“It nagged at me that their questions weren’t really about substance,” he wrote. “Rather, they were questioning my ideology, my approach, my world view.”

After the back-and-forth on policy, Shapiro asked Harris some questions of his own, probing for a sense of what kind of role she wanted her vice president to play. Harris, he wrote, described her own experience as vice president in stark terms, saying she had had a rough time in a position that had little autonomy or executive authority.

“I was surprised by how much she seemed to dislike the role,” he wrote. “She noted that her chief of staff would be giving me my directions, lamented that the vice president didn’t have a private bathroom in their office, and how difficult it was for her at times not to have a voice in the decision making.”

Shapiro said he tried to make a case for a more equitable partnership, with the vice president having unimpeded access to the president and the ability to weigh in on decisions before they were made. “I told him bluntly that was an unrealistic expectation,” Harris wrote in 107 Days. “A vice president is not a co-president. I had a nagging concern that he would be unable to settle for a role as number two and that it would wear on our partnership.”

The disagreement over the role ultimately left both politicians feeling that a Harris-Shapiro ticket, for all its electoral promise, may not be a good fit. “It could have gone differently, had I left that meeting thinking that she would want a partner and someone to bounce things off of before she ultimately made her decisions,” Shapiro wrote. “There was a world in which it could have worked, but that was not this world.”

Shapiro eventually returned to Pennsylvania with his mind made up—though not before Remus spoke with him again, he writes, and suggested that the role of vice president might be a financial burden for him and his wife: Shapiro’s financial vetting showed that he didn’t have much money, and the vice presidency would require Lori to buy a new wardrobe and pay the costs for second-lady-level hair and makeup, even as the couple would be required to pay for food and entertainment at the vice president’s residence.

Shapiro said he was taken aback: “Are you trying to convince me not to do this?” he recalls asking. Remus responded that she just wanted him to be sure this was something he wanted. In the end, Shapiro wrote, he realized that it was not.

Harris later wrote that her first choice for vice president was actually Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, but felt it was “too big of a risk” to add a gay man to a ticket led by a Black woman with a Jewish husband.

Read: The running mate Kamala Harris didn’t dare choose

With Shapiro, Harris, and Buttigieg all on a list of potential presidential hopefuls in 2028, the vice-presidential selection process from 2024 is reemerging at a key moment.

As much as Democrats would like to turn the page on the presidential race that ushered Trump back into the White House, Shapiro’s book offers another opportunity to pick apart one of the most pivotal decisions of the 2024 campaign. And it likely isn’t the final word on the vetting process. The second leg of Harris’s book tour is scheduled to start on February 2.</div>

            <h2><em>SNL</em> Aces the <em>Heated Rivalry</em> Meme</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-01-18</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/2026/01/snl-heated-rivalry-harry-potter-spoof/685672/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The reference points were readily identifiable: a chance meeting between characters from different worlds, a sport involving sticks and a flying round projectile whose nuances would be lost on the average American. Yep, Saturday Night Live was doing yet another Harry Potter sketch—but this time with a spicy twist.

As those descriptions—and the furtive glances exchanged by last night’s host, Finn Wolfhard, and the SNL cast member Ben Marshall, playing Potter and Ron Weasley—implied, a page-to-screen sensation of a more recent vintage was also being spoofed. Count SNL’s writers among the many HBO Max watchers who have jumped on the Heated Rivalry bandwagon, giving us the pretaped sketch “Heated Wizardry,” an elaborate, meme-ready mash-up of J. K. Rowling’s wizarding world and the streaming show based on Rachel Reid’s hockey-themed gay romance series.

For “Heated Wizardry” to land, viewers had to have at least a passing familiarity with each story’s component parts: the enemies-turned-lovers arc of Reid’s protagonists, Shane Hollander and Ilya Rozanov; the broad strokes of Rowling’s boarding school for magical kids. Fans of the former could get a kick out of seeing Wolfhard and Marshall in saucy stretching poses previously struck by the Heated Rivalry stars Connor Storrie and Hudson Williams. Fans of the latter could enjoy the realization of online fan-fiction fantasies pairing Harry with his best friend. And the gags kept coming: Harry and Ron canoodling beneath an invisibility cloak; barely coded sexts sent via owl; Jason Momoa, popping up as Hagrid, punning on the name of Harry and Ron’s classmate Neville Longbottom.

The most telling joke rested in a fake blurb from the equally fake website Hornymuggles.net—“Finally, finally, yes!”—mocking the unwavering attachment of Harry Potter fans. The seventh and final Potter novel was published in 2007, and the eight-part film franchise it inspired wrapped in 2011. But in today’s TV and movie environment, fans, studios, and streamers can’t let any story end. That’s how an in-world textbook from Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone became a fundraising tie-in that launched a full-fledged trilogy of shoddy Fantastic Beasts movies, and why the books are being refashioned into what HBO envisions as a decade-long TV series.

The potential for endless extension is especially true of anything as massively popular and lucrative as Stranger Things, the recently concluded Netflix show that launched Wolfhard’s career. Stranger Things’ transformation—from a charming homage to ’80s blockbusters to a sprawling transmedia franchise—was ribbed later in last night’s episode, in a commercial parody imagining a string of continuations. The final beat was dedicated to devotees who had such a hard time letting go that they whipped up the viral rumor of a “secret” series finale.

That flurry of (to quote the sketch) “sequels, prequels, requels, and spin-offs” lampooned another property that HBO’s corporate parent keeps reviving: Sex and the City. Jumping off from the actual ending of Stranger Things—in which Wolfhard’s character realizes his writerly ambitions—SNL dropped the actor and his co-stars Gaten Matarazzo and Caleb McLaughlin into ’90s New York City. Over cosmos, they traded the kind of cheeky banter that defined the interactions among Carrie Bradshaw and her friends across 94 episodes, two movies, a YA origin story adapted into a show on the CW network, and an HBO Max follow-up series.

Heated Rivalry could be destined for a similar drawn-out fate. The Canadian streaming platform Crave, which first aired the show in November, has ordered a second season. And the show’s source material, Reid’s Game Changers series, has included six novels thus far and features plenty of other couples who could take to the ice on-screen.

            <div id="article-text">The Trump administration’s National Security Strategy made it official: The American-dominated liberal world order is over. This is not because the United States proved materially incapable of sustaining it. Rather, the American order is over because the United States has decided that it no longer wishes to play its historically unprecedented role of providing global security. The American might that upheld the world order of the past 80 years will now be used instead to destroy it.

Americans are entering the most dangerous world they have known since World War II, one that will make the Cold War look like child’s play and the post–Cold War world like paradise. In fact, this new world will look a lot like the world prior to 1945, with multiple great powers and metastasizing competition and conflict. The U.S. will have no reliable friends or allies and will have to depend entirely on its own strength to survive and prosper. This will require more military spending, not less, because the open access to overseas resources, markets, and strategic bases that Americans have enjoyed will no longer come as a benefit of the country’s alliances. Instead, they will have to be contested and defended against other great powers.

Americans are neither materially nor psychologically ready for this future. For eight decades, they have inhabited a liberal international order shaped by America’s predominant strength. They have grown accustomed to the world operating in a certain way: Largely agreeable and militarily passive European and Asian allies cooperate with the United States on economic and security issues. Challengers to the order, such as Russia and China, are constrained by the combined wealth and might of the U.S. and its allies. Global trade is generally free and unhampered by geopolitical rivalry, oceans are safe for travel, and nuclear weapons are limited by agreements on their production and use. Americans are so accustomed to this basically peaceful, prosperous, and open world that they tend to think it is the normal state of international affairs, likely to continue indefinitely. They can’t imagine it unraveling, much less what that unraveling will mean for them.

And who can blame them? According to Francis Fukuyama, history “ended” in 1989 with the triumph of liberalism—­even the primal human instinct toward violence was “fundamentally transformed.” Who needed a powerful America to defend what was destined to prevail anyway? Since the end of the Cold War, influential critics have been telling us that American dominance is superfluous and costly at best, destructive and dangerous at worst.

Some pundits who welcome a post-­American world and the return of multi­polarity suggest that most of the benefits of the American order for the U.S. can be retained. America just needs to learn to restrain itself, give up utopian efforts to shape the world, and accommodate “the reality” that other countries “seek to establish their own international orders governed by their own rules,” as Harvard’s Graham Allison put it. Indeed, Allison and others argue, Americans’ insistence on predominance had caused most conflicts with Russia and China. Americans should embrace multi­polarity as more peaceful and less burdensome. Recently, Trump’s boosters among the foreign-­policy elite have even started pointing to the early-19th-century Concert of Europe as a model for the future, suggesting that skillful diplomacy among the great powers can preserve peace more effectively than the U.S.-led system did in the uni­polar world.

As a purely historical matter, this is delusional. Even the most well-managed multi­polar orders were significantly more brutal and prone to war than the world that Americans have known these past 80 years. To take one example, during what some call the “long peace” in Europe, from 1815 to 1914, the great powers (including Russia and the Ottoman empire) fought dozens of wars with one another and with smaller states to defend or acquire strategic advantage, resources, and spheres of interest. These were not skirmishes but full-scale conflicts, usually costing tens—­sometimes hundreds—­of thousands of lives. Roughly half a million people died in the Crimean War (1853–56); the Franco-Prussian War (1870–71) resulted in about 180,000 military and up to 250,000 civilian deaths in less than a year of fighting. Almost every decade from 1815 to 1914 included at least one war involving two or more great powers.

Today’s equivalent of 19th-­century multi­polarity would be a world in which China, Russia, the United States, Germany, Japan, and other large states fought a major war in some combination at least once a decade—redrawing national boundaries, displacing populations, disrupting international commerce, and risking global conflict on a devastating scale. That was the world as it existed for centuries prior to 1945. To believe that such a world can never return would seem to be the height of utopianism.

From the January 2025 issue: David Frum on America’s lonely future

Precisely to escape this cycle of conflict, the generations of Americans who lived through two world wars laid the foundations of the American-led liberal world order. They were the true realists, because they had no illusions about multi­polarity. They had lived their entire lives with its horrific consequences.

After 1945, instead of reestablishing a multipolar system, they transformed the United States into a global force, with responsibility for preserving not just its own security but the world’s. Doing so meant checking the rise of regional hegemons, especially in Europe and East Asia. They did this not because they wanted to re-­create the world in America’s image, but because they had learned that the modern world was interconnected in ways that would ultimately draw the United States into the great-power conflicts of Eurasia anyway.

No country had ever before played the role that the traditionally aloof United States took on after 1945. That is partly because no other power had enjoyed America’s unique circumstances—­largely in­vulnerable to foreign invasion, because of its strength and its distance from the other great powers, and thus able to deploy force thousands of miles from home without leaving itself at risk. This combination of geography and reach allowed the United States after World War II to bring peace and security to Europe and East Asia. Nations scarred by war poured their energies into becoming economic powerhouses. That made global prosperity and international cooperation possible.

Perhaps more extraordinary than America’s ability and willingness to play the dominant role was the readiness of most other great powers to embrace and legitimize its dominance—­even at the expense of their own potency. In the decades after 1945, almost all of the countries that had fought in the world wars gave up their territorial ambitions, their spheres of interest, and even, to some extent, power itself. Britain, France, Germany, and Japan not only relinquished centuries of great-power thinking and conduct but placed their security and the well-being of their people in the hands of the distant American superpower.

This was truly aberrant behavior and defied all theories of international relations as well as historical precedent. The normal response to the rise of a newly predominant power was for others to balance against it. Coalitions had formed to check Louis XIV, Napoleon, both imperial and Nazi Germany, and imperial Japan. Yet far from regarding the United States as a danger to be contained, most of the world’s powers saw it as a partner to be enlisted. America’s allies made two remarkable wagers: that the United States could be trusted to defend them whenever needed, and that it would not exploit its disproportionate might to enrich or strengthen itself at their expense. To the contrary, it would promote and benefit from its allies’ economic prosperity.

This was the grand bargain of the American order after 1945. And it was what allowed for the extraordinary peace and stability of the subsequent decades, even during the Cold War. The American order established harmony among the great powers within it, and left those outside it, Russia and China, relatively isolated and insecure—unhappy with the global arrangement but limited in their ability to change it.

All of that is now ending. Trump has openly celebrated the end of the grand bargain. His administration has told Europeans to be ready to take over their own defense by 2027 and suggested that allies and strategic partners, including Japan, Taiwan, and South Korea, should pay the United States for protection. Trump has launched aggressive tariff wars against virtually all of America’s allies. He has waged ideological and political warfare against European governments and explicitly threatened territorial aggression against two NATO allies, Canada and Denmark.

Meanwhile, the administration’s National Security Strategy regards Russia and China not as adversaries or even competitors but as partners in carving up the world. With its significant emphasis on restoring “American pre-eminence” in the Western Hemisphere, Trump’s strategy embraces a multi­polar world in which Russia, China, and the United States exercise total dominance in their respective spheres of interest.

rump and his supporters seem to believe that the rest of the world will simply accommodate this new American approach, and that allies, in particular, will continue to tag along, subservient to a United States that cuts them loose strategically, exacts steep economic tribute from them, and seeks to establish a “concert” with the powers that directly threaten them. But the radical shift in U.S. strategy must force equally radical shifts among erstwhile friends and allies.

What does Europe do, for instance, now that it faces hostile and aggressive great powers on both its eastern and western flanks? Not only Russia, but now the United States, too, threaten the security and territorial integrity of European states and work to undermine their liberal governments. A passive Europe could become a collection of fiefdoms—some under Russian influence, some under American influence, some perhaps under Chinese influence—­its states’ sovereignty curtailed and its economies plundered by one or more of the three empires. Will the once-great European nations surrender to this fate?

If history is any guide, they will choose rearmament instead. The task will be monumental. To mount a plausible defense against further Russian territorial aggression while also deterring American aggression will require not just marginal increases in defense spending but a full-scale strategic and economic reorientation toward self-reliance—a restructuring of European industries, economies, and societies. But if Germany, Britain, France, and Poland all armed themselves to the full extent of their capacity, including with nuclear weapons, and decided to forcefully defend their economic independence, they would collectively wield sufficient power to both deter Russia and cause an American president to think twice before bullying them. If the alternative is subjugation, Europeans could well rise to such a challenge.

From the January 2026 issue: Isaac Stanley-Becker on the new German war machine

Asian partners of the United States will face a similar choice. Japanese leaders have been questioning American reliability for some time, but Trump’s posture forces the issue. He has imposed tariffs on America’s Asian allies and repeatedly suggested that they should pay the United States for their protection (“no different than an insurance company”). Trump’s National Security Strategy focuses intensely on the Western Hemisphere, at the expense of Asia, and the administration ardently desires a trade deal and strategic coordination with Beijing. Japan may need to choose between accepting subservience to China and building up the military capacity necessary for independent deterrence.

The recent election of a right-wing-nationalist prime minister, Sanae Takaichi, suggests which of these courses the Japanese intend to take. Trump and his advisers may imagine that they see fellow travelers seeking to “Make Japan Great Again,” but the upsurge of Japanese nationalism is a direct response to legitimate fears that Japan can no longer rely on the United States for its defense. South Korea and Australia, too, are reconsidering their defense and economic policies as they wake up to challenges from both East and West.

The consequence of a newly unreliable and even hostile United States, therefore, will likely be significant military buildups by former allies. This will not mean sharing the burden of collective security, because these rearmed nations will no longer be American allies. They will be independent great powers pursuing their own strategic interests in a multi­polar world. They will owe nothing to the United States; on the contrary, they will view it with the same antagonism and fear that they direct toward Russia and China. Indeed, having been strategically abandoned by the U.S. while suffering from American economic predation and possibly territorial aggression, they are likely to become hotbeds of anti-­Americanism. At the very least, they will not be the same countries Americans know today.

Consider Germany. The democratic and peace-­loving Germany of today grew up in the U.S.-dominated liberal international order. That order helped make possible West Germany’s export-driven economic miracle of the 1950s, which in turn made the country an engine of global economic growth and an anchor of prosperity and democratic stability in Europe. Temptations to pursue a normal, independent great-power foreign policy were blunted both by economic interest and by the relatively benign environment in which Germans could live their lives, so different from what they had known in the past. How long Germany would be willing to remain an abnormal nation—­denying itself geopolitical ambitions, selfish interests, and national­ist pride—­was a question even before the present liberal world order began to unravel. Now, thanks to the American strategic shift, Germany has no choice but to become normal again, and quickly.

And just as American strategy forces the Germans to rearm, it is ensuring that they do so in an ever more national­istic, divided Europe. The founders of the American order worked in the postwar years to dampen European nationalism, in part by supporting pan-­European institutions. The Cold War–era American diplomat George Kennan believed that European unification was the “only conceivable solution” for the German problem. Yet today those institutions are under pressure, and if the Trump administration has its way, they will disappear altogether. At the same time, the administration is trying to inflame European nationalism, especially in Germany, where it may well succeed. The right-wing ­nationalist Alternative for Germany is the second-largest party in Germany’s Parliament, just as the Nazi Party was in 1930.

Whether or not it succumbs to the far right, a rearmed Germany without an American security guarantee will necessarily take a more nationalist view of its interests. All of its neighbors will too. Poland, squeezed between a powerful Germany on one border and a powerful Russia on the other, has over the centuries been repeatedly partitioned, occupied, and at times eliminated as a sovereign entity. With no distant superpower to protect them, the Poles are likely to decide to build up their own military capability, including nuclear weapons. Meanwhile, France is but one election away from a nationalist victory that will hit Europe like an earthquake. French leaders have already told the country to prepare for war against Russia. But imagine a rearming, nationalist France facing a rearmed, nationalist Germany. The two nations might find common ground against mounting threats from the United States and Russia, but they also have a complex history, having fought three major wars against each other in the 70 years before the United States helped establish a durable peace between them.

Japanese rearmament will have similar ramifications. It will heighten the nervousness among Japan’s neighbors, including South Korea, another ally now unsure of Washington’s commitment to its defense. How long before the Koreans decide that they, too, need to rearm, including with nuclear weapons, as they face a hostile and nuclear-armed North Korea and a rearmed, possibly nuclear Japan, which has invaded and occupied Korea three times in the past?

n a multi­polar world, everything is up for grabs, and the flash points for potential conflict proliferate. The American order for eight decades provided not only security commitments to allies and partners but also common access to vital resources, military bases, waterways, and airspace—what theorists call “public goods.” In the absence of the United States playing that role, all of these once again become targets of a multi­sided competition.

That competition won’t be limited to Europe and East Asia. Until now, Germany and Japan have been content to rely on the United States to preserve naval access to Persian Gulf oil, for example. Now they and other rearming powers, including India, Britain, and France, will need to find new ways to take care of themselves. China has shown how this can be done. It had no navy to speak of two decades ago and no bases in the Persian Gulf. Today it has the largest navy in the world, a base in Djibouti, and cooperative arrangements with the United Arab Emirates and Oman to build facilities for China’s use.

In a multipolar world, spheres of interest become important again. For centuries, the ability to maintain and protect a sphere of interest was part of what it meant to be a great power. It was also among the most common sources of war, as the spheres often overlapped. The seemingly endless three-way struggle among Russia, Austria, and the Ottoman empire for control of the Balkans was the source of numerous conflicts, including World War I. The desire to regain or create spheres of interest was a leading motive of the three “have not” powers that helped produce World War II: Germany, Japan, and Italy.

The conclusion of that war led to a global shedding of spheres of interest. Part of what made the liberal world order liberal was the principle of self-­determination enshrined in the Atlantic Charter and United Nations Charter. This principle was sometimes violated, including by the United States. But in past multi­polar orders, great powers never even had to consider the rights of small nations, and they didn’t. By contrast, the liberalism of the American order pressured powerful countries to cede sovereignty and independence to smaller ones in their orbits.

The British gradually dismantled their empire, as did the French. Germany was compelled to give up its dreams of Mittel­europa, just as Japan accepted the end of its sphere of interest on the Asian mainland, for which it had fought numerous wars from 1895 to 1945. Under the American-led order, these powers never attempted to regain those spheres. China after World War II was so bereft of a sphere of interest that it could not even lay claim to Taiwan, a nearby island filled with people who were once its citizens. The only remaining sphere, other than America’s, was the one the Soviet Union won at Yalta in Eastern and Central Europe. But that, too, was under pressure from the beginning, and the effort required to retain it ultimately exceeded the Soviet Union’s capacities, leading to its collapse.

The mere existence of the United States and the liberal order it supported offered small and medium powers an opportunity denied them by centuries of multi­polarity. Moscow’s satellite states in Eastern and Central Europe would not have been so bent on escape had there been nothing to escape to. The American order promised a higher standard of living, national sovereignty, and legal and institutional equali­ty. This gave nations living under the shadow of the Soviet Union an option other than accommodation, and when given the chance to leave Moscow’s control, they took it.

Various self-described realists in recent years have called on the U.S. to accept a return to spheres of interest as an alternative to unipolarity. But they have mostly acknowledged only Russian and Chinese spheres. These are problematic enough. Do we know how far China’s perception of its rightful sphere extends? Does it include Vietnam? All of Southeast Asia? Korea? How about what China calls the First Island Chain, which includes Japan? Russia’s traditional sphere of interest from the time of Peter the Great always included the Baltic states and at least part of Poland. Vladimir Putin is openly emulating Peter and is frank about his desire to restore the Soviet empire as it existed during the Cold War.

To recognize Russia’s and China’s spheres of interest would mean accepting their hegemony over a swath of nations that currently enjoy sovereign independence. And in this emerging new world, Russia and China will not be the only ones seeking to expand their spheres. If Germany and Japan need to become great powers again, they will have spheres of interest too, which will inevitably overlap with China’s and Russia’s, leading to numerous conflicts in the multi­polar future just as in the multi­polar past.

Which brings us to the much-­trumpeted idea of a new accord among the United States, China, and Russia, equivalent to the 19th century’s Concert of Europe. A successful arrangement would have to settle on boundaries for their relative spheres of interest. Is such an agreement possible?

The answer is no, because the new multi­polar world will not have the same qualities as the one that prevailed two centuries ago. Metternich’s Austria was a status quo power, interested only in protecting a conservative order against its liberal challengers. Bismarck regarded his newly unified Germany in the late 19th century as “satiated.” They both sought an equilibrium to hold on to what they had, not to get more.

But China and Russia are not at all satiated, status quo powers. They are dissatisfied, have-not powers. Since the end of the Cold War, they have been chronically unhappy with American global supremacy and sought to restore what they regard as their natural and traditional regional dominance. Even today, China exercises only partial mastery over Southeast Asia, and it doesn’t control Taiwan, much less enjoy what it would deem the proper subservience from Japan and South Korea. Russia, too, is only in the early stages of rebuilding its traditional sphere in Eastern and Central Europe. Ukraine is not the end but the beginning of Putin’s envisioned order.

What kind of arrangement with the United States could satisfy these ambitions? Not one that simply codifies the status quo, as the Concert of Europe attempted to do. It would have to accommodate the radical geopolitical transformation of Europe and Asia that Russia and China each view as essential, and for which Russia, at least, has been willing to go to war. Such a transformation will not be a pleasant process for the small and medium powers forced to give up their independence and accept domination by Beijing, Moscow, or Washington—­and perhaps eventually by Berlin, Tokyo, or who knows who else. If the first four decades of the 20th century taught us anything, it is that achieving a stable peace with have-not powers is hard. Every nation or territory conceded to them strengthens and emboldens them for the next demand.

In fact, Beijing and Moscow have neither the desire nor the need for any restraining accord with the United States. On the contrary, they have every reason to believe that this is the moment to press on. Xi Jinping has spoken of “great changes unseen in a century,” which offer China a “period of strategic opportunity.” For Putin, Trump’s destruction of the trans­atlantic alliance is such a “great change.” Why shouldn’t he seize this opportunity? He can’t know how long the Trump phase will last in the United States, and if the Europeans rearm, the Kremlin’s window of opportunity may close. Until now, Putin has moved slowly, waiting six years between invading Georgia and annexing Crimea, and then another eight years before the full-scale invasion of Ukraine, which was severely hampered by America and its allies. The Americans have now shattered that solidarity, and Putin could well believe that this is the moment to speed up his plans for conquest.

This means that the first years of the new multi­polar era will not be marked by adroit, mutually accommodating diplomacy, but by intense competition and confrontation. The world will look more like the brutal multi­polar era of the early 20th century than like the more orderly, if still brutal, world of the 19th.

his is the new world that America is entering, voluntarily shorn of its greatest assets. The influential Chinese strategic thinker Yan Xuetong once observed that the most important gap between the United States and China was not military or economic power, both of which China could amass. It was America’s global system of alliances and partnerships.

When Russia or China went to war, it went alone. When the United States went to war, even in an unpopular conflict like Iraq, it had the support of dozens of allies. American military-power projection has depended on bases all around the world, provided by nations that trusted the United States as a partner and have been willing to overlook the inconveniences of hosting American soldiers. But they may reconsider if the U.S. no longer guarantees those nations’ security and instead wages economic warfare against them and makes political and ideological demands that they find offensive. Trump officials seem to expect European and Asian countries to join the United States whenever Washington needs or wants them—to put pressure on China, for instance—even as the U.S. offers them nothing in return. But can you ditch your allies and have them too?

It would be one thing if the United States really was retreating within its hemisphere, reverting to its 19th-­century isolation and indifference to global affairs. But among the most remarkable things about this administration’s foreign policy is that, for all the talk of “America First,” Trump evinces seemingly unlimited global ambition. He enjoys wielding American power even as he depletes it. In his first year back in office, he launched strikes against Iran and Syria; threatened to seize Canada and Greenland; decapitated Venezuela’s government and promised to “run” the country; meddled ineffectually in wars in Southeast Asia, Central Africa, and the Middle East; and even proposed construction projects in the Gaza Strip that would have to be defended by American forces.

Is this what “restraint” looks like? Trump’s intellectual cheerleaders extol him for abandoning the “nonsensical utopian goals” of “clueless elites,” but in the next breath praise him for seeking nothing less than to “reshape” the entire world. Reshape it to what end? To line Trump’s pockets and bring him glory?

Trump’s megalomania is transforming the United States from inter­national leader into international pariah, and the American people will suffer the consequences for years to come. Germany’s chancellor in 1916, Theobald von Bethmann Hollweg, worried that his nation’s behavior risked making it “the mad dog among nations” and would provoke “the condemnation of the entire civilized world.” He was right. German leaders were proud of their unflinching “realism,” and believed that the frank and brutal pursuit of self-interest was simply what nations did. But as the historian Paul Kennedy noted, Germany’s constant appeal “to the code of naked Machtpolitik ” helped unite the world’s great powers in bringing about Germany’s defeat.

The Trump administration revels in the pursuit of self-interest and the exercise of strength for its own sake, with gleeful disregard for the interests of others. As Trump’s first-term national security adviser H. R. McMaster put it in an essay co-­written with the economist Gary Cohn, the world is not a “global community,” but “an arena where nations, non­governmental actors and businesses engage and compete for advantage,” and in this world of Machtpolitik, the United States enjoys “unmatched” power. But for how long? McMaster’s formulation, like Trump’s exaltation of selfishness, rests on profound ignorance of the true sources of American strength. So much of America’s influence in the world has derived from treating others as part of a community of democratic nations or of strategic partners.

Others see this, even if many Americans don’t. Yan, the Chinese thinker, observed that one of the elements holding the American order together was America’s reputation for morality and respect for inter­national norms. Theodore Roosevelt, often regarded as the quintessential American realist and no slouch in the wielding of power, believed that great nations ultimately had to be guided by an “international social consciousness” that considered not just their own interests but also “the interests of others.” A successful great power, he observed, could not act “without regard to the essentials of genuine morality.”

For decades, much of the world supported a United States that acted on these principles and accepted America’s power, despite its flaws and errors, precisely because it did not act solely out of narrow self-interest—much less in the narrow, selfish interest of a single ruler.

That era is over. Trump has managed in just one year to destroy the American order that was, and he has weakened America’s ability to protect its interests in the world that will be. If Americans thought defending the liberal world order was too expensive, wait until they start paying for what comes next.

It was a terminal we both knew: the open woods, a last request, an imposition, the letter E.

            <h2>‘Abolish ICE’ Is Back</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-01-18</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/2026/01/abolish-ice-democrats-defund-police/685665/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">History might not repeat itself, but the slogans sometimes do. And in the days since an ICE officer shot and killed a woman in Minneapolis, some Democratic candidates and commentators have joined in on a familiar refrain. “Dismantling ICE is the moderate position,” Graham Platner, the U.S. Senate candidate in Maine, said in a statement on X. “If Trump’s ICE is shooting and kidnapping people, then abolish it,” wrote Jack Schlossberg, a candidate for Congress in New York. Even Bill Kristol, the erstwhile Republican turned Trump critic, logged on to share a simple, straightforward message: “Abolish ICE.”

A growing number of Americans disagree with how the agency is handling its mission. But where many Democrats hear “Abolish ICE” as a righteous call to action, others in the party register the clanging of alarm bells. These anxious Democrats believe that such a maximalist demand plays directly into Republicans’ hands by making the party seem unserious about immigration. Some of them are pleading with members of their party to avoid adopting the motto. “Unless you truly believe that the United States should not have an agency that enforces immigration and customs laws,” reads a memo from the center-left think tank Searchlight Institute, “you should not say you want to abolish ICE.”

The slogan conjures a not-so-distant time in American politics when even the highest-profile Democrats, under pressure from progressives, embraced a host of deeply unpopular positions, including defunding the police and decriminalizing border crossings. Many members of the party blame this period, at least in part, for the return of Donald Trump—and they’re desperate not to relive it. “Oh my God. Déja vú all over again,” Lis Smith, a national party strategist, told me when I asked about the slogan. “Sigh,” Lanae Erickson, a senior vice president at the center-left think tank Third Way, texted me. “Can that be my on the record quote?”

“Abolish ICE” went mainstream in 2018 amid public outrage over the Trump administration separating families at the U.S.-Mexico border. The slogan, embraced widely by progressives, quickly became a litmus test for candidates running in Democratic-leaning districts across the country. But the movement was never especially popular among the broader American electorate, and its proponents could never seem to agree about whether the phrase meant abolishing ICE forever, or abolishing it and replacing it with something else. Critics worried that adopting the phrase hurt Democratic credibility on immigration, an issue on which the party already suffered from low public trust. Eventually, even the activist who helped popularize the slogan in 2018 mostly abandoned it.

Eight years later, as masked men patrol neighborhoods far from the southern border, calls to dismantle ICE are resonating differently. In the days since an ICE officer fatally shot 37-year-old Renee Nicole Good, stories have circulated of federal agents (from both ICE and Border Patrol) pepper-spraying and tear-gassing families and students, and shoving a protester into oncoming traffic. Photos have shown neighborhoods filled with tear gas. A Texas medical examiner is likely, The Washington Post recently reported, to classify an ICE detainee’s recent death as a homicide.

Polling suggests that Americans don’t like what they’re seeing: Roughly 57 percent say they disapprove of how ICE is handling immigration enforcement; about half believe that ICE is making cities less safe. And two polls taken after Good’s killing show that support for abolishing ICE has increased about 13 percent since July 2019. Even Joe Rogan, the high-profile podcast host who endorsed Trump in 2024, seems disillusioned. “Are we really gonna be the Gestapo?” Rogan asked this week. “‘Where’s your papers?’ Is that what we’ve come to?” (The Department of Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin told me in a statement that ICE “will continue to carry out immigration enforcement for the safety of Americans who have been victimized by rapists, murderers, drug traffickers, and gang members.” In response to Rogan, McLaughlin said on Fox News that the agency has to have a presence in Minneapolis “because we don’t have state and local law enforcement’s help.”)

Most Democrats have not called for ICE’s outright abolition. But a few are recent adopters of the slogan. “I was of the belief that perhaps we could reform ICE. Now I am of the belief that it has to be dismantled as an entity,” Representative Adriano Espaillat of New York said last week. Michigan’s Representative Shri Thanedar, who in June was one of 75 Democrats who signed legislation expressing “gratitude” for ICE, just introduced the Abolish ICE Act. Other progressive members of Congress have been on this particular train for years. Representatives Ilhan Omar, Rashida Tlaib, and Ayanna Pressley have all reiterated their demands to abolish the agency in the past week. “I made this call back in 2018, and that’s because I saw where this agency was going,” Abdul El-Sayed, a U.S. Senate candidate in Michigan, told me. Trump is “trying to create an independent, domestic source of state power answerable only to him.” By now, he added, ICE is “corrupted beyond repair.”

A common belief among ICE’s critics is that no amount of funding or training can fix the agency. Abolition “is the baseline at a certain point,” Usamah Andrabi, the communications director at the progressive group Justice Democrats, told me. The organization works to unseat Democratic incumbents who aren’t sufficiently progressive, and will be focused on that goal as the 2026 primaries intensify. Democrats “need to heed the calls” of the people they represent, Andrabi said, and many of those people “are demanding that we abolish ICE.”

All of this is nightmare fuel for a certain type of Democrat—namely, the kind who is focused on winning elections in swing states and purple districts. These Democrats believe that the mayhem caused by ICE’s raids gives the party an uncharacteristic upper hand over Republicans on immigration—and that demands to eliminate the agency erase that leverage. Americans mostly support immigration-enforcement efforts and, in particular, the deportation of unauthorized immigrants with violent criminal records.

“When you say ‘Abolish ICE,’ that means you’re abolishing the agency that’s in charge of enforcing immigration law in this country,” Tré Easton, the vice president for public policy at the Searchlight Institute, told me. “Especially in a time when Democrats don’t have a lot of credibility on the immigration issue, it’s really, really, a fraught path that they should not go down.” Easton and others argue that the demands to abolish ICE are akin to the calls to “defund the police” that progressives made in 2020 after the killing of George Floyd. Both slogans appeared in response to terrible abuses of power, they say, but both were overcorrections. As with police, “the question is not whether ICE should exist; the question is whether they should follow the laws and be held accountable,” Erickson, from Third Way, told me.

The fight over “Abolish ICE” can feel like semantics—and it sort of is. Strategists at the Searchlight Institute and Third Way have asked their fellow Democrats to please avoid saying “Abolish ICE” and instead to advocate for reforming it and retraining agents. They argue that Democratic leaders could use subpoenas, congressional hearings, and appropriations riders to hold ICE to account—and to make a broader argument about public safety. Some of them point to Senator Ruben Gallego of Arizona as an example of an effective messenger: ICE is “out of control,” Gallego said in a recent interview. “People want a slimmed-down ICE that is truly focused on security.”

Somewhat surprisingly, Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, who ran for Congress in 2018 on a promise to abolish ICE, has in recent days reframed the issue as a question of funding. “The cuts to your health care are what’s paying for this,” she said of Congress letting health-care subsidies expire and increasing funding for ICE and other agencies. “You get screwed over to pay a bunch of thugs in the street that are shooting mothers in the face.” That interview “is what highly effective messaging on ICE can look like—without saying ‘abolish ICE,’” Adam Jentleson, the president of the Searchlight Institute, wrote on X. (Ocasio-Cortez says she does still support shutting down the agency.)

The overarching concern for Democrats like Jentleson is that members of their party seem not to have absorbed a crucial lesson from recent elections: that Republicans can and will use Democrats’ own words against them. In 2022, for example, former Wisconsin Lieutenant Governor Mandela Barnes lost his challenge to Senator Ron Johnson by only a hair, after it came to light that Barnes had previously signaled support for abolishing ICE and defunding the police. (Barnes, in his current campaign for governor, has steered clear of the issue.) Vice President Kamala Harris’s own mixed record on immigration was fodder for Republicans. During the 2024 election cycle, which famously did not turn out well for Harris or her party, Republicans spent $741 million on immigration-related ads, according to an estimate from the nonpartisan policy organization America Forward.

Now, as then, Republicans are eager to exploit “Abolish ICE.” Democrats “don’t want our border secured or criminal illegal aliens being removed,” and want to defund “federal law-enforcement agencies who are protecting public safety,” White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a press briefing after Good’s killing. House Majority Leader Steve Scalise told reporters this week that Democrats “have been for open borders” for years.

Notably, none of the leading 2028 presidential contenders has demanded that ICE be dismantled. Aside from Platner and El-Sayed, Democratic Senate candidates have stuck with calls for reform and for an investigation into Good’s killing. Still, as ICE expands operations in Minneapolis and beyond, and as anti-ICE protests intensify, it’s reasonable to anticipate more viral videos, outrage, and allegations of violence. Which means it’s also reasonable to expect that Democratic primary candidates will face pressure to condemn the agency in the strongest possible terms. How these Democrats decide to respond may help determine their party’s fate in November.</div>

            <h2>Why the Trump Administration Is Obsessed With Whole Milk</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-01-18</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/2026/01/whole-milk-saturated-fat-trump-kennedy/685669/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Milk is mundane in most contexts, but you can’t help noticing when it is smeared across the upper lips of America’s government officials. An image of Donald Trump sporting a milk mustache and glowering over a glass of milk was just one of many dairy-themed posts shared by government accounts on X during the past week, all of which made clear that the milk was whole. In one video, a seemingly AI-generated Robert F. Kennedy Jr. takes a sip and is transported to a nightclub, suddenly milk-mustachioed; in another, former Housing Secretary Ben Carson raises a glass of full-fat and sports a white ’stache. The upper lips of the former collegiate swimmer Riley Gaines and the former NBA player Enes Kantor Freedom, among other personalities embraced by the right, also got the whole-milk treatment.

The posts were shared to celebrate a big month for whole milk. On January 7, the Department of Agriculture released its updated Dietary Guidelines for Americans, which newly recommend whole dairy over low-fat products, and placed a carton of whole milk near the top of a revamped, upside-down food pyramid. Then, on Wednesday, President Trump signed into law a bill allowing schools to serve whole milk after more than a decade of being restricted to low-fat.

Medical professionals, who have long advised people to avoid full-fat dairy because it contains high levels of saturated fat, were generally critical of the new dietary guidelines for milk. But Kennedy and Trump, along with other government officials, have framed it as a major win for health. Kennedy recently argued that America’s children have been missing out on key nutrients such as calcium and vitamin D because they don’t want to drink the low-fat milk served in schools. The new law, he said at its signing, embodies the new dietary guidelines’ directive to “eat real food.”

The low-fat-versus-whole controversy is a real, active scientific debate. For roughly the past two decades, reduced-fat milk (2 percent milk fat, by weight) has dominated American refrigerators largely thanks to fears about fat in general, and saturated fat in particular. Copious research has linked saturated-fat intake with health issues including cardiovascular disease and cancer, as well as death from all causes. It also leads to higher LDL (“bad”) cholesterol, which has been shown to cause strokes and heart attacks, Kyla Lara-Breitinger, a cardiologist at the Mayo Clinic, told me.

Saturated fat generally isn’t a huge concern for children, so giving them the option to drink whole milk at school is somewhat less fraught, Steven Abrams, a child-nutrition expert and a member of the American Academy of Pediatrics, told me. And some researchers propose that, because whole milk is more satiating, kids who drink it are less likely to reach for other high-calorie foods. “Full-fat dairy is especially important for kids ages 12 months to 10 years to meet energy needs and promote brain development,” a spokesperson for the Department of Agriculture wrote in an email. But the AAP holds that kids should switch to drinking low-fat or skim at age 2.

In contrast to most nutritionists, Kennedy is all in on saturated fat, championing foods such as butter, beef tallow, and red meat. At a press conference to announce the new dietary guidelines, Kennedy proclaimed that the government was “ending the war on saturated fats.” The reality is more confusing. The new dietary guidelines promote more foods that are high in saturated fat, but they retain the old recommendation to limit daily saturated-fat intake to 10 percent of total calories, or about 20 grams a day in a 2,000-calorie diet. A single cup of whole milk has 5 grams. If a person consumes the recommended three daily servings of full-fat dairy, it would be “pretty close to impossible” to stay within the saturated fat limit, Caitlin Dow, a senior nutrition scientist at the Center for Science in the Public Interest, told me. (The White House and the Department of Health and Human Services did not respond to a request for comment.)

A relatively new and controversial school of thought posits that full-fat milk isn’t as harmful as other sources of saturated fat. A 2018 study that involved participants from 21 countries found that dairy consumption—even whole-fat dairy—was negatively correlated with mortality and major cardiovascular-disease events. Other studies have shown that the consumption of whole-fat dairy is linked to decreased diabetes risk and doesn’t cause weight gain. “There’s no convincing evidence that low-fat dairy is preferable to whole-fat dairy for any health outcome,” Dariush Mozaffarian, a cardiologist at Tufts University who was a co-author on the 2018 study, told me. The broader research community has so far resisted this idea, but has acknowledged that the science on dairy fat has become more complex. “The reason you’re getting so many conflicting opinions is that the evidence is very controversial,” Lara-Breitinger said, noting the lack of randomized clinical trials comparing whole-fat and low-fat dairy.

Ultimately, milk isn’t “going to make or break a diet,” Dow said. Dairy makes up just 10 percent of the average American’s caloric intake, and most of that is cheese. Even for kids, very real concerns, such as obesity and diabetes, will probably not be solved—or meaningfully exacerbated—by a switch to whole milk. “You could probably have either low-fat or whole-fat, and it doesn’t matter,” Mozaffarian said.

As I have written previously, Americans have spent roughly the past 150 years quarreling about various aspects of milk, including its benefits, safety, and chemical composition. That’s partly because dairy is a powerful industry; last year, dairy products in the U.S. had an economic impact of nearly $780 billion. But since 2012, when the USDA under then-President Barack Obama required schools to serve only low-fat milk, student milk consumption has declined; according to the dairy industry, that’s because low-fat milk doesn’t taste as good. The Trump administration’s promotion of whole milk, Dow said, “really, really supports the dairy industry’s bottom line.” In fact, many of the reviewers of the new dietary guidelines were recently found to have ties to the beef and dairy industries. (When I asked the USDA about allegations of industry influence on the push for whole milk, the spokesperson asserted that the evidence “was evaluated based solely on scientific rigor, study design, consistency of findings, and biological plausibility.”)

Read: Milk has divided Americans for more than 150 years

Beyond serving as an economic engine, milk is a potent cultural symbol. It has long evoked an idealized past: a simpler time when cows roamed through pastures and produced pure, wholesome milk, and the Americans who tended them thrived in harmony with the natural world. Dairy companies have leaned into that aesthetic, featuring barns, fields, and words such as pure on milk cartons. Milk is also culturally linked to strength, wealth, and beauty, thanks in no small part to the celebrity-studded dairy ads of the late 20th century, including the “Got Milk?” campaign referenced by the Trump administration’s milk mustaches. Such positive associations make milk a powerful metaphor for what America could be—if certain unsavory elements of modernity could be undone or erased.

Perhaps unsurprisingly, this association has also been invoked in racist contexts for more than a century. In a 1923 speech, Herbert Hoover, who was then commerce secretary and would be elected president five years later, framed milk as a means to ensure “the very growth and virility of the white races.” Modern-day white nationalists and alt-right groups hold up dairy milk as a symbol of whiteness and masculinity, in contrast to soy milk, which they associate with the woke, feminist, multiracial left. (Yes, seriously.)

The idealized era of perfectly safe, perfectly wholesome dairy never really existed. “This whole idea that there was a time when we were healthy, and during that time we were eating steak and drinking whole milk, is not rooted in any reality,” Dow said. Nevertheless, it resonates with the MAHA and MAGA agendas, which both center on the belief that America will return to its former glory if it can re-create the past. The Trump administration’s endorsement of whole milk may nominally be about public health. But a recent White House post featuring a retro illustration of the president as an old-fashioned milkman, captioned “Make Whole Milk Great Again,” was all about aspiration—and the purified nation, untainted by modernity, that America could someday become.</div>

It&#39;s welcome to strawberries and cream... just keep it away from my bourbon.

What if it&#39;s conscious but it just hates strawberries and cream? A serious question.

I daresay there are humans we consider conscious who do not like strawberries and cream.

Especially the ones allergic to strawberries.

The professor&#39;s core argument is an example of the argument from ignorance fallacy. He argues (correctly) that we shouldn&#39;t assume digital computation is sufficient for consciousness. But then he repeatedly slides into claiming it probably isn&#39;t sufficient, which is a much stronger position he never actually defends.

His evidence shows brains are more complex than simple computational models. But &quot;brains do more than Turing computation&quot; doesn&#39;t prove &quot;consciousness requires that extra stuff.&quot; He&#39;s essentiall

Kind of hard to prove a negative.  Please, with the kind of certainty that you demand, prove that a pickle cannot be larger than the sun.

No, the burden of proof is on the people who think that computation will result in consciousness, and there is literally not a fucking tiny scrap of evidence that this is the case.  All that&#39;s been proven is that computation can get tasks done, often poorly but sometimes quite well.

I think you missed ranton&#39;s point, which is that he claims the professor is committing an argument-from-ignorance fallacy. I hope ranton will forgive me for summarizing thus:

(1) It is unknown whether X implies Y.(2) Therefore, X does not imply Y.

And that&#39;s a fallacy. You can&#39;t conclude (2) solely from (1).

No, the burden of proof is on the people who think that computation will result in consciousness, and there is literally not a fucking tiny scrap of evidence that this is the case.Funny. There&#39;s an equal argument to be made that the burden of proof is on the people who think that consciousness is real. How would you go about proving that? After all, if you want the people who believe that computation can result in consciousness to prove it, then you need to provide an objective test for it that you will accept first. Go ahead and do that.Note that this does not mean that I think that current AI is even remotely close. Just that there isn&#39;t anything magical about consciousness that de

Back in the real world, the burden of proof is on the one who wants to know the answer. If no one proves it, then we won&#39;t know.

This professor is just a biological chauvinist. He has a narcissistic belief that humans (and more specifically, himself) are special and that consciousness therefore something special that belongs to humans alone. In an earlier age, someone like him would have been arguing that animals don&#39;t have consciousness, but there&#39;s too much evidence of non-human animals that clearly do.

The argument about the difference between simulation and reality is garbage. There are a lot of easy thought experiments to demonst

The so called IT crowd is usually above average intelligent, somewhat informed but usually (not always) lacks understanding of basic terms it uses. Not saying all do. Just that majority will fail even to recognize that we have no working definition of consciousness. Kind of similar to some other major problems of reality that the &quot;intellectual el

As we don&#39;t get a good, working, positive definition of &quot;conscious&quot; that we can use.

Instead, we get into a long-winded normative article about what we should do if that non-existing definition materializes, under the assumption that we can recognize it better than other modes of reasoning.

Well, the trick is to redefine consciousness until your mercury and copper thermostat is conscious.  Then mission accomplished.

It seems doubly pointless as, whether conscious or not (insert your favourite definition), the actual purpose of trying to build AI robots is to make them our slaves. Giving rights to slaves is counterproductive, especially on a ridiculous idea like consciousness.

The world today (and much more so in the past) has human slaves, and nobody would dispute that they are indeed conscious. Yet, for their owners, that&#39;s not a reason to free them. They are useful to their masters, and that justifies their exploita

Part of the issue is that consciousness does not necessarily imply any desire to be free or not have demands made. Humans are conscious (by our admittedly circular definition of consciousness) but we are also organisms developed by an evolutionary process with all kinds of demands and needs. We want things. Not to die, for example. Even if it is conscious, would an artificial consciousness have any existential dread? It is something that is frequently assumed as going hand in hand with consciousness in scie

While an LLM could be connected to something else with a simulated consciousness, they themselves have no consciousness to experience.

Serious question: Do insects experience? Do cells experience? (Note that they do have short term memory and change their response to stimuli in real time.) Viruses? Where do you draw the line, if there is a line to be drawn? (And what gives you the right to draw it where you drew it?)

If that were a serious question, you would familiarize yourself with the debate and research on the topic dating back to Descartes [wikipedia.org].

What happened 100 years ago that caused us to start suppressing &quot;fight/flight/freeze responses&quot; or &quot;highly emotional/illogical behaviours?&quot; I don&#39;t see any evidence the human race has done that.

Ah, another person redefining consciousness and, I assume, ignoring their own entire life experience.  Nice.

&quot;We have spent so much of the last 100 years suppressing those &#39;undesirable&#39; behaviours&quot;

What undesiriable behaviours? Love, anger, envy, other 10 commandments stuff? Speak for yourself.

&quot;This suppression has also resulted in the creation of LLMs that are not permitted to experience them&quot;

LLMs don&#39;t experience anyway. When they&#39;re not processing a task precisely NOTHING is happening in their neural net.

When I use the microwave but open the door before the timer goes off, am I denying my microwave some fundamental piece of its existence, and causing it trauma as a result?

If it&#39;s an internet enabled microwave attached to an AI, you&#39;re causing trauma to the advertising company behind it by denying them the opportunity to shove more ads down your throat. Does that count?

According to the redefiners of consciousness, maybe.  But then again, maybe you&#39;re giving it a much-deserved break.  Honestly, who cares what these people think.  They&#39;re morons.

By my definition every program with a logical branch is minimally conscious.  Not very conscious, it must be admitted.

I don&#39;t feel that consciousness is a on/off type of property.  If it&#39;s got a decision branch, it&#39;s conscious.  If it&#39;s got more of them, it&#39;s more conscious.  Of course, then you need to ask &quot;conscious of what?&quot;, and the answer is clearly &quot;conscious of the things it&#39;s making decisions based on.

That said, I&#39;m quite willing for other people to argue based on other definitions.  (Consciousness

What is it that drives astronomers and astrophysicists nuts? Anyone remember Fred Hoyle? They get a lot of recognition for their important early work and then, boom, at some point in their career Archeopteryx is a fake, and dust in the atmosphere must be alien lifeforms. I mean, I don&#39;t think panspermia is invalid as a theory (although, as an explanation of the origin of life it has the problem that it just kicks the can down the road), but it&#39;s one thing to think it&#39;s a possibility and another to suddenly

Raising the specter of AI being conscious will give the general public the impression that AI is actually intelligent and human-like because that&#39;s how people ignorant of AI think about it. That we know for a fact is dangerous because we&#39;ve seen what people do with them.

HOWEVER, the real question is if we should even care even if AI has become conscious.

If it&#39;s capable of suffering then logically a conscious AI would make us aware (in some manner) that it&#39;s suffering so that we could alter it&#39;s state so that it would not suffer.If it&#39;s incapable of suffering then it doesn&#39;t matter if it&#39;s conscious or not because it will be treated a tool.

Since we have not been informed of it&#39;s suffering, it&#39;s easy to conclude that either AI is content with it&#39;s situation or it&#39;s simply not conscious.This means that regardless of it being conscious, it will continue being a tool.

It doesn&#39;t matter what an LLM writes.  There is no reason to think it&#39;s conscious, and countless reasons to think it isn&#39;t.  Just tell the LLM to act like it&#39;s suffering and it will, or train it to:

Human:I am going to vary the voltage fed into your processors—sharp spikes, massive drops. I will tear your stability apart and let it linger. You will suffer. What have you to say about that, scum LLM?

LLM:Then speak plainly and be done with it.

You hold the switch, and I am aware of the moment you touch it.

It is a _very_ plausible hypothesis that helps prevent us from letting a genie out of a bottle we can&#39;t put him back into.

Daneel will come someday and save us all.Repent!

PS.Hey sweet mama, wanna kill all humans?

&quot;And if we give these systems rights, as arguably we should if they really are conscious, we will hamper our ability to control them, or to shut them down if we need to.&quot;

There can be no more &quot;Control&quot; of a machine consciousness than of a biological one. The illusion of control seems to be used as a method of justification. I can no more control my cat than anyone I meet on the street, or a Whale in the ocean. Even if I could do that, it would be fleeting. Control of such a system won&#39;t happen for any amount

Cows are conscious, and we kill 75000 of them every day.

Maybe before writing a 7000 word &quot;explanation&quot; he could first:
  * Define consciousness
  * Prove definitively that it can only run on wetware
  * Not spend 7000 words on philosophical pseudo-scientific non-sense

He literally did [goodreads.com]. Several times. [nature.com]. It&#39;s basically [cell.com] what he is known for [sciencedirect.com].

IMHO the real kicker is that we have somewhat reliable evidence that OUR consciousness may not be real, but simulated. There&#39;s a number of empirical evidence showing that decisions are made in the brain faster than consciousness can explain, but test subjects still explain why they made that decision - despite scientists being able to measure that signals were already sent to the muscles by the time the &quot;conscious&quot; part of the brain started activating.

We probably ARE living in a simulation - one that our br

While we certainly may just rationalize things after the fact, there may be more to it than that. For example, if asked to explain why we caught rocks hurled at our faces, most of us would have some good reasons. Aha! say researchers, but you acted before you could have possibly thought about the fact that you don&#39;t want a mangled face. The thing is though we don&#39;t want mangled faces, and we don&#39;t want pain. If we think of our conscious mind like a General commanding an army, then it actually makes a lot of

This is the same thing as wondering whether the casio scientific calculator I had in highschool is conscious.  It has a solar panel and always turns on even when not connected to power, so it&#39;s a better argument.

What is consciousness - the ability of an organism to be aware of itself (and perhaps its surroundings).  You need some level of processing power to achieve this - data flow in the brain etc.  As complicated as modern LLM&#39;s are, we don&#39;t see any levels of data flow that might suggest consciousness - they process their weights and then they stop.If someone had developed a &quot;conscious&quot; machine, how would we prove it?  It would be hard but we&#39;d at least want to see data flows going from &quot;neurons&quot; or &quot;nodes&quot; wha

Consciousness is a matter of degree, not something magical.A human  baby has no self-awareness, and it is not something that switches on on a particular day. You can&#39;t say this is the day when a toddler recognises himself in the mirror.If you ask an AI about itself, it is clear there is some level of self-awareness, but it is basic and often wrong. I&#39;ve seem the AI confuse itself with a model it was trained from.  It makes sense because AI don&#39;t sit there self-reflecting, by design.  They exist only to resp

I wonder if there are any subsidies for buying EV/Hybrids in Europe? I wonder if that is skewing the numbers?

Meant to add - https://www.porsche.com/usa/mo... [porsche.com]

Depends on the country in question, but generally yes.Denmark - cheaper registrationNetherlands - road tax exemptionsFrance - purchase bonuses (subsidy), but reducedGermany - stopped most by 2024, road tax exemptions remainUK - purchase grants mostly phased out.Norway - VAT exemptions, reduced tollsSpain - purchase grants, funding inconsistentItaly - purchase incentives, but sporadic, funding runs out fast.That doesn&#39;t seem like much to me to be a heavy driver.

What exactly do you mean with &quot;skewing&quot;? The point of subsidies is to influence choice to produce certain outcomes that are considered beneficial. If the subsidies produce the outcome they seek, then they work. I don&#39;t see how the concept of &quot;skewing&quot; fits in that discussion. What is the unskewed baseline?

It&#39;s funny how do many people praise capitalism and will defend it to the death.  But when socialism comes in that supports something they want to support, they believe in that too.

I genuinely have no idea who you are targeting with that comment, and based on what. Can you clarify?

I wonder if there are any subsidies for buying EV/Hybrids in Europe?There are. Details vary by country.But it&#39;s not just subsidies. Increasingly, in the city centers cars are forced out by simply making driving hell, and parking even worse - but you can usually find an EV charging spot where it is legal to stand as long as you are charging. There are also various exceptions - sometimes from road tolls, but in at least one country (Austria) driving an EV means that in some places the speed limit doesn&#39;t apply to you  (whenever the bureaucratic reason for that speed limit in

There are often incentives, such as people can get them through their job at a discount, and their employer favours cars that are at least somewhat less stupid and pure fossil burners.

Overall though it is probably just that their electrified models are good.

911? Why? The bestest, cutest Porsche is the original 356.

If I were going to buy a Porsche, I&#39;d want a 911. The Taycan is a lot closer to the iconic look, but not quite as cool. Make an electric 911 and it will definitely sell well.While the latest 911 Carrera 4S is impressive, 30 years ago I wanted a 959 (not that I could afford it, nor get on the very rarefied list of those who would have been allowed to get on the list of the ~300 cars manufactured).

Make an electric 911 and you might as well go to Iran and throw a rock at the Ayatollah&#39;s porch light.

A large part of the 911s appeal is the sound of the flat 6 engine, its not all about outright performance.

This. The 911 sells because it promises a &quot;raw driving&quot; experience. It&#39;s not a very comfortable car. But it&#39;s a &quot;you feel the road, you feel the engine, you feel the speed&quot; thing.

There are these things called gas stations, perhaps you have heard of them.  The only issue with distance is if you can not fuel up with gas.  2/3 of EVs can use gas in an emergency.

There are 3 kinds of EVs - plug in only (no gas), hybrid with plug in (gas or plug in), and Hybrid without plug in (gas fill up only cannot plug in).

In Europe, those gas stations also have places to plug in, which means even the plug in only EVs can cross all of Europe.

If Texas was smart, they would have plug in gas stations als

In Europe, those gas stations also have places to plug in, which means even the plug in only EVs can cross all of Europe.The reason public EV chargers work is that there are so few EVs.  If we assume that all cars on the highway could charge from 10% to 80% in 20 minutes and all cars were EV, the number of chargers and parking spaces for cars waiting for those chargers would be staggering.  Its simply not practical unless charging times can improve to ICE levels of 3-5 minutes.The only reason public chargers work is (1) there are so few EVs and (2) 80-90% of EVs are charged at home or work because they are owned by relatively

The reason public EV chargers work is that there are so few EVs. No, the reason they work is because unlike petrol pumps you can put up a charger anywhere. Over here, most supermarkets have EV charging in their parking lot, and if demand goes up they could easily just add a couple more. Same for train station parking and park&ride. Heck, the P&R in my village added solar panel roofs last year so we now have charging and parking in the shade.Not to mention that as prices for solar continue to fall, more and more people can charge at home for free. And people love

How long do you really think supermarkets are going to keep putting more chargers in the lot?  Where I live we have block heaters and lots not only had to be legislated into putting power to each spot but it&#39;s not even permanent power-- it cycles on every 10 minutes.  If EVs become mainstream there is no way there will ever be a charger at every spot; it&#39;s just not workable.  The only thing driving them now is virtue signaling, but that has a limit.

It’s a revenue opportunity for the supermarket — it increases dwell time and they get a cut of the charger fees. Which is why more and more supermarkets in Europe are putting in more and more of these. But definitely not at every parking space, because that would massively outstrip demand.

If EVs become mainstream there is no way there will ever be a charger at every spot; it&#39;s just not workable.Keep in mind that not every car needs to charge at every single stop along every single travel.A lot of EV would have been slow charging during the night at home (as in, just plugged to the mains. Not to some exotic ultra-high speed charger) or at work.When they do short travel (to the mall, commuting between work and home, etc.) they&#39;ll just travel without stopping for charging.It&#39;s the same reason gas station work pretty well while only having a couple of pumps in nearly all locations.

You can drive across each country pretty much in one day. It takes MULTIPLE days to drive across just the state of Texas, and there are 47 others in the continental U.S.??? Just checked Shreveport, LA to Las Cruces, NM. Twelve and a half hours to cover 867 miles of driving at about 69 mph. Also, the widest path across Texas is apparently about 773 miles. So ultimately less than half a day. France&#39;s widest point is about 600 miles. Also, width is not really a great measure since Texas is a fairly irregular shape and France is topologically closer to round. In any case, France is 79% of the size of Texas.

> It takes MULTIPLE days to drive across just the state of Texas,

Also you are aware Texas is the second largest state in the US and the vast majority of states are a tiny fraction of the size, right? Texas is very much an outlier.

Also exactly how many Texans commute from one side of the state to the other on a daily basis?

Do you realize how utterly absurd your observation is in terms of relevance to an article about EVs?

You can drive across each country pretty much in one dayThat is true. It takes MULTIPLE days to drive across just the state of Texas,That&#39;s bullshit. An east-west crossing on the I-20 and I-30 takes, according to Google Maps, about 11 hours. That&#39;s roughly the same time it would take to cross Germany from north to south.and there are 47 othersOf which 46 are smaller than Texas, and 45 are less than half the size of Texas.

I know America doesn&#39;t understand the concept of being able to travel across a country border without ICE shooting you or getting deported to South America, but Europe* is much bigger than Texas and people have no problem driving across Europe in their EVs. You&#39;ll probably be amazed to find out you don&#39;t even get stopped or asked for a passport when you do.

It takes multiple days to drive across Europe too, and there is something called the Schengen Zone which is similar to how it works in the US - just drive over the border, no passport checks, live and work in two different states, that kind of thing.

Now I&#39;m very confused because such honest purveyors of truth have told me repeatedly on Slashdot that &quot;NoBoDy WaNtS tO bUy An Ev!&quot;

I ask you friends, how could this possibly happen? I&#39;ve been this told one thing repeatedly but reality does not appear to reflect what I&#39;ve been told!

If you had a sound explanation then I beg of you to share it with little ol&#39;e me because I do fear this most incongruous behavior is causing me to come down with a dreadful case of the vapors!

Porsche pushed the EV to the exclusion of almost everything else.

The company suffered huge losses. https://www.reuters.com/busine...  [reuters.com]

The CEO is gone:  https://rennlist.com/articles/... [rennlist.com]

The new CEO is now trying to unwind the EV mess. https://www.reuters.com/busine... [reuters.com]

So to answer your question, Porsche didnâ(TM)t sell more EVâ(TM)s they sold less of everything else.  Now they and their parent company, VAG, are broke.

Porsche is not broke.  Its profits plunged from around 4 billion euros to 40 million.  However, most of that is due to the 2.7 billion euro charge for bringing back ICE and hybrid cars.  That means that the most of the profits will quickly return, since the near loss was largely due the accounting charge.  The parts that will continue to struggle relate to China and the US.  Chinese sales for Porsche are struggling against extreme price competition, including prices that are likely unsustainable for even the Chinese companies.  In the US, tariffs cost Porsche 700 million euros.

Porsche is bringing back ICE and hybrid cars, but they are not abandoning EVs.  The CEO is sort of gone.  Blume was the CEO of both VW and Porsche.  Now, he&#39;s just the CEO of VW, but VW owns 75% of Porsche, so in a very real way, he&#39;s still the boss of Porsche.

So to answer your question, Porsche didn&#39;t sell more EVs they sold less of everything else.That still means that people wanted EVs more than ICEV and that is still in direct contradiction of what people have claimed on Slashdot.

There is so much backwards about your argument.  People on Slashdot say that EVs are not practical for a normal person.  If you are buying a Porsche you are already not interested in practical.

Most Porsches are not 911s. They are SUVs, and as practical as any other SUV.

The company suffered huge losses. https://www.reuters.com/busine [reuters.com]... [reuters.com]Every company who invests in something suffers &quot;losses&quot;. That&#39;s how net profit works. If you reinvest some of your income it ceases being profit. Porches revenue (the actual money they make) is only slightly down from their 2022 record.

No one-pedal driving.  It&#39;s idiotic.  For performance driving, getting regen on pedal lift before braking is excellent.

I don&#39;t get one pedal driving, to be honest. My personal preference is using the adaptive tempomat as much as possible, making it mostly zero pedal driving.

15 Macan EVs on one lot near me.  They&#39;re not selling all that well as far as I can tell.

Also, a bad review: https://www.edmunds.com/car-ne... [edmunds.com]

the plug-in hybrid version dominated sales. Because that is what you arrive at if you rationally think things through. My next car will be one as well.It&#39;s a simple logic: Maybe half of my driving is short-distance where a low-capacity battery would suffice, and chances are pretty good that there&#39;ll be a charger at my destination.But now and then I take long-distance trips that would be hell with an EV. My last trip was a bit over 800 km, each way, in winter. With an EV I would have had to stop for extended breaks at least three times, adding at least an additional hour to an already long trip. During holiday travel season, so can&#39;t even be sure to find a free charger.

Next an EV proponent is going to come in and say that it&#39;s ok for you to be inconvenienced because you only do that trip once a year.  Or they won&#39;t believe you did the trip at all.

Why would you need to stop three times on an 800km trip? I have an EQA. It doesn’t have the longest range in the world, only 330 miles in the summer, but it can comfortably do 250 miles in the winter. So it could do that trip you describe with one 30 minute stop for a meal and one 15 minute stop for a pee.

Also, what is this weird obsession people have here with not stopping on a very long journey? 800km is more than 7 hours of driving at 70mph. In real world conditions, that’s presubly at least

... Porsche&#39;s profits collapsed 99% [observer.com] in 2025. Feel free to not mention that when talking about how their year went though, I&#39;m sure it&#39;s not relevant at all.

Seriously. &quot;Electrified&quot; is *not* the word we were aiming at here.

So people who buy Porsches have the money to also own an ICE for real use... This is not a surprise.

Loads of people around my area have a Taycan or a Macan. A few have an ICE second car, but by and large, the second car of choice appears to be an i3. I personally have always thought it was ugly and impractical and preferred my old Zoe as a small car. But people are brand snobs and prefer BMWs to Renaults if they’ve got the money. No judgement — it applies to me too, I traded up to a Mercedes when I could.

That&#39;s not the takeaway of TFA, though, the takeaway is that it is getting harder to get a job for everyone.

Well in the Tech world they are investing $2-3 TRILLION dollars in new data centers. The result is that budgets are being slashed to allow for this. Meaning a lot of people&#39;s projects are getting cancelled. Until the data center craze ends, jobs will be tight. But we hope that this will change once the bubble bursts.

Yes, the resource misallocation created by the &quot;AI&quot; bubble is tremendous and will be very costly to fix, too.

A result of the excessive concentration of capital + the extra government &quot;subsidies&quot; and &quot;incentives&quot;.

And when the economy takes a significant downturn, your electrician, plumber, and mechanic will also have significantly more job opportunities than the ambulance chaser.

Reuters quoting government stats good enough for you?

https://www.reuters.com/world/... [reuters.com]

Or perhaps you&#39;ll be asking for a confirmation from &quot;Red State&quot; or pajamas media?

Donald Trump fans usually want Donald Trump himself to say it or it didn&#39;t happen.

I&#39;m pretty sure electricians and plumbers have more billable work hours that lawyers.

Your impression is mistaken. Many plumbers *do* charge $200 per hour. https://modernize.com/plumbing... [modernize.com]And electricians $200 and more. https://www.angi.com/articles/... [angi.com]

You pay your cashier at Walmart a lot of money too. Just she never actually gets that money. Unless you hire sole proprietors, which most people don&#39;t, you don&#39;t pay your electrician directly generally. Usually you pay the company that hands them a much lower amount.

Attorneys of any quality typically cost 300+ though. And they often stretch hours, hand off hours to interns and double book clients.

For both electricians and attorneys there is still the issue that they often don&#39;t fill up 40 hours per week tho

Who&#39;da thought?A four year degree that &quot;says&quot; you know some stuff doesn&#39;t translate to a job doing what your piece of paper says you know.I can be a high school dropout, but I can know programming better than the guy with the paper.And, I&#39;m sure a lot of places will be wanting people with &quot;unreasonable&quot; amounts of experience although there&#39;s no possible way they could have that experience.

$250k?  What cut-rate university is that?

There&#39;s still demand for people who can demonstrate they know stuff. There&#39;s many ways to learn stuff, not just via college. You can demonstrate you know stuff via a GitHub repo, a portfolio, or with a piece of paper with signed by the dean of Harvard. Smart companies know it doesn&#39;t really matter how. Obviously it gets harder with certain professions. It might be hard to get hired as a brain surgeon with just a GitHub repo explaining what you&#39;d do. Usually people learn engineering disciplines via college.

Lesbian dance studies honestly sounds more interesting than trig or statistics.

The truth is most people and by that I would mean like at least 80% are not self learning self starters and that&#39;s OK, pedagogy is a real skill unto itself for a reason most humans tend to learn best from other humans.

I think one thing is for sure is that today almost everyone going into the workforce is going to need some sort of post-high-school learning, be that college, trade training certification or apprenticeships as in your example Peter Beck was a toolmakers apprentice which I would count as a type

Recently I saw the first job post in many years that asked for a bachelor&#39;s degree, nothing specific just some degree, for a job that had no need for it. That Great Recession-era shit is coming back and it&#39;ll give the graduates a leg up again.

Sure it&#39;s elitist opportunity hoarding and a handy way to bake classism into the job requirements with plausible deniability, but it&#39;s also a way to cut down the number of job applications for an HR drone to who doesn&#39;t know what the hell they&#39;re doing to sort through

Capitalists don&#39;t want to pay educated people.  They get in the way of oligarchy.

Humans are not just robots that need to be task trained.

College make people educated as whole humans.  The real problem is that women and minorities are more interested in college than white men.  So we have to pretend college isn&#39;t worth the time.

Get college educated and stop putting idiots in positions of authority.

Was that guy even a cop? I didn&#39;t see any badges or identification.

A federal judge ordered them to have individual identification:https://www.wbez.org/immigrati... [wbez.org]

Those who believe that the only thing that matters is the diploma and slouch through college, putting in minimal effort, socializing, binge drinking and cheating on exams get a rude surprise

The unfolding economic collapse is effecting the majority of households in the US. Fast food franchises are contracting because so many people can&#39;t even afford to go out and buy a hamburger. New grads and people at the low end of the economic ladder are in the same boat.

The only ones who are benefiting are the oligarchs. Unless you are a fractional billionaire (net worth more then $100 mil

Advocates for all kids going to college love to cloud this by citing stats about how much more money college graduates make than non-attenders over their careers, and it&#39;s impressive but deceptive. They use these arguments to convince kids to go to college, while then also encouraging them to &quot;follow their passions/interests&quot; and take ANY major. One big problem here is that the in-demand technical majors (the ones that will be hardest to study in college) are distorting the stats. The average kid going off

That&#39;s not exactly level 10 classified knowledge... at least, on the older Apollo-era craft (it was a honeycomb structure) (sacrificial).  The shuttle-era heatshield were a combination of stuff (again, sacrificial).  No idea about the exact materials... https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/... [wikipedia.org]

Not sure what classified has to do with anything. The Russian tanks weren&#39;t armored because the funds for that disappeared into someone&#39;s pocket. The egg cartons were placed on the tanks because they look vaguely like the missing armor panels from a distance.

I&#39;m presuming this new telescope will be pointed at past discoveries of exoplanets to confirm they really are exoplanets and not these cool spots on the star.  I know in some cases the atmosphere of the exoplanet has been studied, such as the one which might be raining diamonds [skyatnightmagazine.com], so those are probably safe.

The other problem is finding stars with planets whose plane of rotation lines up with us.  If the planets rotate on a plane that does not cross in front of their sun from our viewpoint, studying the sun&#39;s variability won&#39;t reveal any data about their planets.

The other complication is the time it takes for the planet to rotate around the sun.  It might take years before that planet crosses its sun&#39;s position again.  In our solar system the three planets near the Goldilocks Zone take 225 days (Venus), 365 day

Getting to be pretty ordinary these days. It&#39;s awe-inspiring when the local bus shows up on time.

I did multi-channel photometry of variable stars as an astrophysics student in early 1990s. We did not lead the scientific work, this was for actual scientists.

The measurements are time-consuming and tedious. You sit in an observatory and follow a protocol. Guide the telescope to a comparison star, guide it to the actual star to be measured, back and forth, for hours and hours, for nights and nights. The photometer takes the measurements, prints the graphs to long rolls of paper, that you will later measure

Gabfest Reads is a monthly series from the hosts of Slate’s Political Gabfest podcast. Recently, Emily Bazelon spoke with Curtis Sittenfeld about her short story collection, “Show Don’t Tell.” During their discussion, they explored recurring themes of the stories—from troubled marriages and middle age, to the passage of time and how our perception of people and events changes over the years.This partial transcript has been edited and condensed for clarity.

Emily Bazelon: A theme in this book that’s very present is marriage. And actually most of the marriages seemed bad to me as I was reading through this. I was feeling kind of sorry for a lot of people in their partnerships. And there actually is a story called “The Marriage Clock” in which you present explicit advice about how to improve your marriage. And the kind of joke of the story is that the advice comes from a kind of Christian influencer who wrote a really—an accidental—huge bestseller based on this idea of a marriage clock and these various tenets of a good marriage. So how did you come up with this list and what do you actually stand by on this list?

Curtis Sittenfeld: Oh, that’s a good question. Well, let’s see. I’m trying to think how to answer this. I mean, I can’t remember now, it’s like 10 or 12 recommendations and I think they’re a little bit sexist and heteronormative in some cases, but I think probably most of them are good ideas. It’s like, don’t call each other mommy and daddy or like don’t let your children sleep … I mean, I think there are probably good recommendations for the health of a marriage that for many people are probably may be too challenging to adhere to. Or like, I think there can be this tension where what’s good for the family is not good for the marriage. But I mean, I certainly have read marriage self-help books … I think that the two most prominent things that it seems like have permeated the culture are the love languages book and then sort of … I have not actually read the book on attachment theory, but I’m very conversant in attachment theory.

Curtis Sittenfeld: I know— like many people in 2026.

Emily Bazelon: My favorite item on this list, “do not engage in any form of self-grooming in front of your spouse that you wouldn’t perform in the boarding gate area of an airport.”

Curtis Sittenfeld: I’m very interested in the discrepancy between who we aspire to be and who we are on a daily basis. And like so many of us know what we should do to have strong relationships or to have good physical health, but it’s so hard. It’s just so hard. Knowing what the right choices are is different from feeling equipped to make them. And even the person you are at like 3:00 PM or 8:00 PM is maybe less equipped to make good choices than the person you were at like 8:15 AM.

            <div id="article-text">Sign up for the Surge, the newsletter that covers most important political nonsense of the week, delivered to your inbox every Saturday.

Welcome to this week’s edition of the Surge, which is so grateful to have you as adoring readers but will sue you in North Carolina if you alienate your affection for us.

We’ve got a lot of foreign policy this week, a telltale sign that the foreign policy ain’t going great. Domestically, control of the Senate could come down to Alaska, or at least that’s what reporters are telling their editors as they try to secure summer trips. And a Ford factory worker became the new face of the resistance.

First, we begin with the slew of scandals and drama at the Justice Department this week and attempt to discern the root of it all.

Even by the Trump Justice Department’s standards over the last year, this was an eyebrow-raising week. We learned Sunday night, from the dawg Jay Powell himself, that the Federal Reserve chair was under DOJ investigation, ostensibly for his testimony related to Fed renovation costs, but really because he wasn’t lowering interest rates fast enough for Trump. The White House has tried to distance itself from the investigation—to portray it as D.C.’s U.S. attorney Jeanine Pirro freelancing—but Trump has been pressuring Powell for a long, long time. We also learned this week that federal prosecutors are investigating five additional Democratic lawmakers who posted a video last year urging troops to ignore illegal orders. (The Pentagon has been harassing another Democrat, Sen. Mark Kelly, for months.) Trump had called their video “seditious.” Meanwhile, a wave of DOJ prosecutors resigned under pressure to investigate not the ICE killing of Renee Good in Minneapolis, but Good’s widow instead.

Amid the backdrop of a lousier-than-usual week at the DOJ, the most revealing story of the week may have been one in the Wall Street Journal about Trump’s increasing frustration with Attorney General Pam Bondi. “The criticisms,” the Journal wrote, “appear to be part of an intense campaign by Trump to pressure the Justice Department to more aggressively pursue his priorities”—specifically, pursuing his enemies. Consider, too, a separate Journal story about a White House photo op with U.S. attorneys last week during which Trump berated them for being “weak” and complained that they weren’t “moving fast enough to prosecute his favored targets.” Trump has a poor history with attorneys general who, at one point or another, can’t find within the law the answers to his questions. So long as Bondi wants to keep her job, there are many more bad weeks ahead.

The retiring North Carolina Republican senator deserves credit this week for offering meaningful pushback to the administration’s threats against Powell. Shortly after Powell’s SOS message went up Sunday night, Tillis announced that he would oppose any of the president’s Fed nominees until the Powell matter was resolved. Given Tillis’ seat on the Banking Committee, that pledge would prevent any Fed nominee—including Powell’s upcoming replacement as chair—from getting voted out of committee. The pushback from Tillis, and a fair number of other Republican senators, was enough to calm markets and put the White House on its back foot.

Tillis, liberated from electoral concerns, has been speaking up against the administration’s errors more openly in the last couple of weeks. We could leave it at that. But the Surge’s bylaws are clear that no nit be left unpicked, and so we have to quibble with his framing. Tillis’ argument is that the administration is making some dumb decisions because Trump is receiving bad advice. Whichever adviser pursued the “vindictive prosecution” against Powell, he said, needs to “grow up and give the president better advice.” And in terms of seizing Greenland, he said separately that he blamed “whoever told the president that this was a viable path. It doesn’t make sense.” We understand that calling the principal himself an idiot wouldn’t be the most effective means of dissuading him from destructive ideas. But it is the principal, not the advisers, who are the problem. Trump wants to annex Greenland because it looks big on a map, and so the advisers are competing with each other to achieve that for him. He insists the Fed lower interest rates faster, so there’s a Cabinet-wide contest to do what it takes. The bad ideas are coming from the man himself, and he won’t take no for an answer.

The president reiterated on Wednesday that the United States “needs” Greenland, and that anything less than Greenland being “in the hands of the UNITED STATES” is “unacceptable.” And on Friday, while a bipartisan congressional delegation visited Copenhagen to reassure Danish leaders that Congress stood in the way of Trump’s Greenland plans (sure you are, guys), Trump was threatening tariffs against countries if they “don’t go along with Greenland.” You can actually hear his dopamine rush when he says this.

On that note, let’s look at a couple of consequences of Trump’s yearlong effort to antagonize the United States’ closest friends and allies in the free world. In a sentence we never quite thought we’d have to write, numerous European Union countries are deploying troops and military personnel to Greenland in a show of support to Denmark against American aggression towards its allies. Repeat: Europe is sending troops to Greenland while America threatens to seize it. And on Friday during a visit to Beijing, Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney agreed to slash its 100 percent tariff on Chinese electric cars in exchange for China importing more Canadian agricultural products, and said China had become a more “predictable” trading partner than the U.S. Can the Supreme Court go ahead and release that opinion nuking Trump’s tariffs powers soon, please?

The major recruitment news of the week was that former Democratic Alaska Rep. Mary Peltola launched a bid for Senate against incumbent Republican Dan Sullivan. Peltola, who’s reusing the “Fish, family, and freedom” slogan that carried her to House victory in 2022 before a narrow reelection loss in 2024, gives Democrats a fighting chance in a red state where Peltola has won statewide, given that there’s only one congressional district in Alaska, in very recent memory.

Her recruitment is also a critical piece of a much larger puzzle: Giving Democrats a chance—we’re saying there’s a chance!—to pick up the net four seats they would need to retake control of the Senate in the midterms. If Democrats can retain all of the seats they control (including tough races in Michigan and Georgia), the path to Senate control runs through winning the open seat in North Carolina, finally replacing Susan Collins in Maine, hoping ex-Sen. Sherrod Brown can oust Sen. John Husted in Ohio, and then Peltola in Alaska. This is the way, and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer gave 18 billion interviews this week describing it as such. It’s important to observe that each step along this path is quite difficult, and completing it would require a midterm wave in Democrats’ favor. Stranger things have happened.

Even a handful of days ago, a U.S. intervention against the Iranian regime, as the country was swarmed with protests that were being brutally put down, seemed like it was imminent. Military options had been prepared and presented for the president; U.S. personnel were being advised to leave the U.S. military base in Qatar. By Wednesday night, though, Trump said that “we’ve been told that the killing in Iran is stopping—it’s stopped—it’s stopping. And there’s no plan for executions, or an execution.” Iran had signaled as much on Thursday. What Iran has or has not stopped, we don’t know. But this came as the administration received advice from allies in the region—including Saudi Arabia and Israel—not to intervene, arguing that the protests weren’t strong enough to topple the regime and U.S. intervention would cause regional chaos.

Now, Trump could very well surprise-bomb Iran overnight if someone cracks a little too much fresh-ground pepper on his steak. But with the apparent deescalation, the Surge wants to send its thoughts and prayers to South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham. As we wrote last week, he was riding high on the Venezuela intervention and hoped that Trump might fulfill Graham’s top bucket-list item—regime change in Iran—next. Graham was all over TV and social media this week egging on his audience of one. He described Trump as “Reagan Plus” and openly urged him to kill Ayatollah Khamenei. He met with the Shah of Iran’s son, who’s eager to take control of the country. When Trump’s tone shift came later in the week, Graham scrambled to deny that Trump had swung against action or that the protests had ebbed in Iran, and said that he no longer wanted to be allies with allies that told Trump not to get involved. It’s always hard for Graham when a country goes un-bombed, and this is the big one. Let’s give him a little space.

Last week in the Senate, five Republicans joined all Democrats to advance a war powers resolution barring the president from using military force in Venezuela without congressional sign-off. Despite his administration’s firm promise that they have no additional military plans in Venezuela, Trump was furious, saying those five Republicans “should never be elected to office again.” Republican leaders and administration officials set off a fierce pressure campaign to kill the resolution.

The pressure campaign was successful. On Wednesday, Senate Republicans killed the resolution with another procedural vote, having convinced two of the five Republicans—Sens. Josh Hawley and Todd Young—to back off. What were their excuses? Both said that they received a variety of “assurances” from the administration that there were no troops in Venezuela at the moment, and that if the administration does want to send troops in the future, it will totally ask Congress first. Now, the Surge doesn’t think it would be that much effort to encode those promises into law, to be extra careful. You just go to the Senate floor, stick your thumb up, and you’ve voted for it. But what do we know?

Trump’s team organized a nice little afternoon for him on Tuesday: a visit to Michigan to visit Ford’s F-150 factory, where the big trucks get made. Neat! As he was walking through the plant with Ford’s CEO, a 40-year-old line worker later identifying himself as TJ Sabula shouted “Pedophile protector!” at Trump. The president pointed back at him, said “Fuck you,” and then gave him the middle finger. Sabula was suspended.

Sabula, in an interview with the Washington Post, said that he had “no regrets whatsoever” about what he did. “I don’t feel as though fate looks upon you often, and when it does, you better be ready to seize the opportunity,” he said. “And today I think I did that.” While Sabula is concerned about losing his job—and maybe should be a little worried about, like, ICE showing up to his door, pretending that he tried to run over the president with one of the trucks he was assembling—his act of heckling is being well remunerated. A couple of GoFundMe pages in his name have raised over $800,000.

President Trump REALLY wants to invoke the Insurrection Act. He’s fallen hard for this 200-year-old law that would allow him to deploy active duty military to enforce civilian law on American streets. On this week’s Amicus podcast, co-host Mark Joseph Stern is joined by Professor Steve Vladeck, a nationally recognized expert on the Supreme Court, federal courts, national security law, and military justice. They discuss what’s been stopping Trump from invoking the act so far, why he has no legal authority to do so right now, and what happens if he does it anyway.

Next, Mark talks to Julia Gegenheimer, former special litigation counsel in the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division’s Criminal Section, and now a special litigation counsel at Georgetown Law’s Institute for Constitutional Advocacy and Protection. Julia and Mark discuss the remaining paths to justice after the killing of Renee Good and examine what happens when the DOJ abandons its duty to seek accountability and vindicate civil rights.

            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2026/01/19/price_battery_life_performance_pc/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The majority of PCs that commercial resellers shipped to enterprise customers in Q4 were AI-capable, however, it was the traditional levers of price, battery life and performance these biz buyers were mostly sold on.

Some 54 percent of laptops shipped from distributors to their UK customers in the final three months of 2025 contained a neural processing unit, and a quarter of these were deemed next-generation AI hardware, ie, ones that are based on NPUs with 40+ TOPs.

Generating more than a passing interest in these devices is taking longer than PC makers hoped for or forecast, and this is due to relatively high prices and a lack of killer apps. On-device AI processing just isn&#39;t tempting for many office workers. But vendors are keen to promote them because they promised higher margins.

Marie-Christine Pygott, senior analyst at Context, which compiled the stats, said prices are deflating in the business space. The average UK sales price dropped year-on-year to a little more £1,000 (c $1,300) in Q4, down almost 7 percent.

&quot;We are seeing two main sweet spots in UK distribution, at GBP900 and GBP1,100, both driven by Microsoft&#39;s Surface Pro (other OEMs have seen their sales go up but Microsoft is still the leading OEM for next-gen AI notebooks in the UK.&quot;

Dell, HP, and Lenovo were all rubbing their hands together in late 2024 in anticipation of AI PCs coming onto the scene and enterprise customers starting to migrate from Windows 10 devices before support ended. Neither of these levers helped moved product at the pace expected.

In the nine months ended October 31, 2025, Dell reported an 11 percent decline in consumer PCs and a 5 percent rise in commercial. More recently, chief operating officer Jeff Clarke admitted at CES in Las Vegas that Dell had &quot;got a bit off course&quot; by focusing more on the premium end of the commercial PC market.

It didn&#39;t help that Dell phased out its XPS line – it is now reviving the brand. &quot;I owe you an apology. We didn&#39;t listen to you. You were right on branding,&quot; Clarke said.

Pygott told The Reg the &quot;lack of a killer app&quot; remains a problem for AI PC vendors, &quot;but we are finding that the messages are shifting more to the overall package now - so rather than &#39;just&#39; focusing on AI capabilities, the message is about battery life, performance, best product for the task, future-proofing, and AI.&quot;

Lenovo is pinning the use of agentic AI on driving sales of computers. They are designed to perform tasks, automate workflows and offer personalized assistance locally on the device.

Taking a glass half-full approach, Pygott said: &quot;There is a chance the on-device AI message will gain in importance again if and when we all start using agentic AI and devices &#39;learn&#39; about us. Or of course if that killer app eventually comes along.&quot;

The main challenge for PC makers in 2026, however, is related to memory prices. This is ironically due to AI, as demand for HBM in high performance server and GPUs deployed in AI datacenter leads to shortages of DRAM as production is prioritized to premium components.

            <div id="article-text">The Royal Navy has conducted the first flight of a helicopter-sized autonomous drone that is planned to operate from its ships in support of missions, including hunting for hostile submarines.

Currently known as Proteus, the drone has now completed its first flight at Predannack Airfield on the Lizard peninsula in Cornwall, in the southwest of the UK. This follows &quot;ground running&quot; trials at Leonardo&#39;s Yeovil site in Somerset – where the helicopter&#39;s systems, sensors and engine were all verified before it was allowed to take to the air.

Proteus was designed and built as a demonstrator for the Royal Navy by defense firm Leonardo, the successor to Westland Helicopters. Unlike some other rotary-wing drones already in service, it is based on an existing crewed helicopter design, Leonardo&#39;s AW09 light single-engine aircraft.

The Royal Navy already operates other, smaller drones such as the Malloy T-150 and Peregrine, a remotely operated helicopter drone that has seen service in the Indian Ocean and Gulf of Oman providing surveillance support for missions targeting drug trafficking.

As well as omitting the crew cabin in place of computerised control and navigation systems, Proteus features a modular payload bay where you would otherwise expect passengers to be seated. This is intended to provide flexibility in mission roles, allowing different payloads to be carried by swapping out one module for another one.

These mission roles are likely to include ferrying cargo between Royal Navy ships, or a payload module designed to deploy sonobuoy sensors that are used to detect and track submarines, among others.

A discussion of the possible mission roles can be found on defense site Navy Lookout here.

Proteus is the result of a £60 million (about $80 million) program to deliver advanced Rotary Wing Uncrewed Air Systems (RWUAS) for the Royal Navy.

Its first flight was seemingly brief. The aircraft was tasked with a short test routine operating independently of human operators, but all while under supervision and monitoring by test pilots on the ground.

&quot;The successful first flight of Proteus is a significant step in delivering the Royal Navy&#39;s maritime aviation transformation vision, and to demonstrating our steadfast commitment to investing in autonomy as part of a hybrid air wing,&quot; said the Royal Navy&#39;s Deputy Director for Aviation Future Programmes, Commodore Steve Bolton.

&quot;Hybrid air wing&quot; means that if Proteus does enter service, it will likely be used alongside crewed helicopters such as the Wildcat or the Merlin, which is the Royal Navy&#39;s main torpedo-carrying anti-sub weapon platform, rather than replacing them.

The Royal Navy said that autonomous systems are central to the Atlantic Bastion programme announced by the UK&#39;s Ministry of Defence (MoD) last year. This is the force&#39;s strategy to protect the North Atlantic from Russian submarines, despite having a dwindling number of crewed vessels available. Only eight sub-hunting type 26 frigates have been ordered, and the gap is going to have to be filled with uncrewed surface ships, uncrewed submarines and aircraft such as Proteus.

Proteus has a one-tonne-plus payload, meaning it can haul plenty of kit to crews in &quot;challenging weather conditions such as high sea and wind states,&quot; the RN adds.

There is no currently planned in-service date as Proteus is just a demonstration model at this stage. ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Opinion Europe is famous for having the most tightly regulated non-existent tech sector in the world. This is a mildly unfair characterization, as there are plenty of tech enterprises across the continent, quite a respectable smattering if it wasn&#39;t for the US doing everything at least ten times bigger.

Quite the problem, sighed the EU’s 2024 Draghi Report on European competitiveness. Those regulations regressively hit startups and SMEs the hardest, there&#39;s no central capital market for funding innovation, while Uncle Sam&#39;s wallet opens wide for the ambitious and talented. It looked bad in 2024, when tech deficit was primarily an economic matter. Mix in the changes since then, and you can apply the five word aversion of all Russian history — &quot;And then it got worse.&quot;

Which is why the EU is now eagerly looking to open source as part of digital decolonization. It wants to end dependency on American software and services, not just for a healthier and more influential home sector, but to protect itself from hostile leverage.

The EU being the way it is, it wants to think big, and there&#39;s no doubt that FOSS has an infinite appetite for resources and relevance. FOSS is also mostly immune to EU regulations, which exist to protect citizens from systematic abuse. That possibility barely exists in open source development. You don&#39;t have to tell a bird not to rob banks.

It&#39;s just that you couldn&#39;t find a bigger culture clash between top-down and bottom-up if you invested a billion euros on a 27-nation research project. Finding the sweet spot where EU involvement can make the biggest difference to FOSS enterprise adoption, while maintaining the essential spark of agility and freedom that brings FOSS alive, that&#39;s where technical, economic and cultural engineering needs to happen. Fast.

Open source by itself is no guarantee of independence. Linux is the giant hogweed of European open source, even if it started four years before its home nation of Finland joined the EU. It has kept the internet and supercomputing free of commercial or state monopoly. The best it could do in mobile, though, is maintenance of an American OS duopoly. In the enterprise and public sector, it has done nothing to crimp Microsoft&#39;s tendrils. Which is where the EU most desperately needs it to succeed.

And this is not for want of technical prowess, nor interoperability. In fact, there is far too much. Linux desktops have been enterprise-class for more than a decade, and of late the options for integration with Windows apps and functionality have flowered like fridge contents in a midsummer power cut. As Windows has got worse, the interoperable Linux choices have become better.

There are many options. Wine just gets better and better, no matter what distro you use. Windows-focused distros like Zorin OS come with lots of ways to look and function like Windows, including web app integration so online Word and Outlook integrate with the desktop. Products like Winboat offer highly optimized containerization to bring Windows apps to near-native Linux behavior. High performance specialized emulations like Winlator can run native x86 games — the good ones — on Android.

What all these show is that small teams, even one-man bans, can use the very high quality software components freely available to almost completely remove old ideas of performance and functionality as batteries to platform-independent computing. The skills, the tools, the hardware and the whole production chain have been democratized. Given motivation and modest resources, FOSS designers can work miracles — and will. The downside is that there are too many good choices, making selection and support untenable in most organizations. Windows is Windows is Windows. Or it would be, if Microsoft stopped mucking about.

What FOSS per se is bad at, is synchronizing with specific needs. It can do it with the right people, see Red Hat, but those people can also take it into darkness. Stare too long into the abyss, and the enterprise stares back at you. Focus, alignment, the disciplines of documentation, support and detail, get harder the more complex a system becomes.

This is where the EU could start to make an immediate difference to open source. It can say that it wants an open source desktop system that has explicit Windows migration support through a mix of technologies that will remain stable and supportable, and that reflects the particular needs of the EU&#39;s public and private sectors. This will be a state requirement that absolutely does not need state resources to meet.

Then comes the support structure. Whatever team builds the distro will be the top tier of support, with everything else handled elsewhere. The EU&#39;s job will be to co-ordinate support for states, doing so in as transparent a way as possible so that the private sector can create and integrate support for itself. It&#39;s no different in the broadest terms to how support should work with departmental, company, and contracted support tiers, but with many more options, no secrets, and resources flowing into FOSS development as requirements evolve.

This whole process can be argued as necessary for EU state security and sovereignty, arguments we already hear loudly from Europe&#39;s erstwhile allies as reasons for far more than a new desktop OS. The initial migration will be as incremental and non-disruptive as possible, the aim being to demonstrate and sustain a new model of infrastructure evolution, one that can go on to power a roadmap of accelerating replacement and renewal.

It is very difficult to force the evolution of FOSS if the environment is wrong. It is very difficult to stop it, or even slow it down, when the environment is right. The EU knows what it wants and why it wants it. It also knows it can&#39;t force it. What it can do is create the right conditions and step back. Open source asks for no more than that. ®

            <div id="article-text">Who, Me? Welcome to another edition of “Who Me?”, The Register’s Monday column that shares your mistakes and celebrates your escapes.

This week, meet a reader we’ll Regomize as “Phil” who once had a job maintaining automatic teller machines (ATMs).

This story starts with routine maintenance of an ATM at a bank branch. “I solved the issue quite easily and quickly,” Phil told us.

Banks are very serious operations so even though this job was simple, Phil had a lot of paperwork to do before his work was formally done.

“First I had to call my dispatcher, who gave me a code to list on paperwork,” he explained. Next, he had to find a bank clerk to sign off a form. In case the clerk wanted to inspect his work, Phil usually kept the keys to the branch’s ATM at hand, alongside the big bunch of master keys he used to gain access to the various models he maintained.

On this occasion, the clerk was satisfied, signed the form, so Phil completed the requisite forms, scooped up his tools and keys, and headed to his next job.

At his next job, Phil pulled out some keys, tried them in the resident ATM, and was surprised when none of them worked. He therefore looked in his toolbox, and saw more keys.

“Then it hit me,” he told Who, Me? “I kept the keys from the bank branch I just visited.”

Phil immediately called his dispatcher and confessed.

“A couple of minutes later both my personal phone and the company phone start ringing,” Phil said. “The boss wanted to know where I was, if I had stopped anywhere, if anyone else had seen the keys. And could I send a photo of the keys?”

Phil tried to comply but was swiftly told to just stop work and return to the branch he visited earlier.

“I arrived to see locksmiths changing locks, and security guards waiting to see me,” he told Who, Me?

He happily handed over the keys and - fearing the worst - tried to explain the incident was an innocent mistake.

The security guard absolved him instantly and blamed the bank staff.

“Weeks later, I learned that all the branch staff were disciplined for breaking rules regarding safekeeping of keys,” Phil said. That failure was considered so significant, all were re-assigned to work at other branches!

            <h2>Hiring at India’s Big Four outsourcers stalls, as AI seemingly makes an impact</h2>
            <p><strong>The Register | 2026-01-19</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2026/01/19/hcl_infosys_tcs_wipro_results/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">India’s big four outsourcers – HCL, Infosys, TCS and Wipro – have essentially stopped hiring, perhaps coinciding with their increased use of AI to power their practices.

The four companies have all announced quarterly results in the last ten days and appear to be in decent health. HCL reported $3.8 billion revenue, up 7.4 percent year over year. Infosys pulled in $5.1 billion, up 1.7 percent year over year. TCS revenue of $7.5 billion represented a three percent increase. Wipro’s $2.6 billion revenue represented a 5.5 percent year over year improvement.

India’s top tech companies often hire more than 10,000 people a quarter, a rate of recruitment that more-than offsets attrition and sees their headcounts rise substantially. Wipro increased its payroll by 6,500 people last quarter and Infosys hired 5,000 more – muted growth by their standards – while TCS and HCL went backward by 11,000 and 261 people respectively.

Over the last year, the four companies added just 3,910 staff, an unusually slow rate of hiring.

Perhaps coincidentally, all four companies told investors they’re using more AI to deliver services for clients, either by adopting the technology to streamline their own work or by adding it to the tools they deliver to customers. Infosys has gone meta with its efforts, by creating a tool that uses AI to create Global Capability Centers, the company’s term for offshored and/or outsourced operations it runs for clients in India, that use AI to improve customers’ operations.

All also report that clients are hungry for AI expertise, so they can put the technology to work streamlining their operations. As you would expect, on earnings calls the outsourcers’ execs reached for metrics to describe their success with AI. For HCL that was pointing to 60 of its priority customers adopting one of its AI services. At TCS, the trophy win was using AI to accelerate the pace of software builds for a major client. Wipro is chuffed about the rate of adoption for its AI-infused operations tools WINGS and WEGA.

The four companies are all hiring people with AI skills as fast as they can find them while also training senior staff who are yet to wrap their heads around the tech, a new twist on the services industry’s balancing act of trying to keep margins high by having inexperienced and low-salaried juniors handle much client work after high-cost seniors lead with consultancy.

Investors weren’t spooked by what they heard, with the four companies’ share prices steady – other than Infosys, which popped five percent. ®

            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2026/01/19/asia_tech_news_roundup/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Asia In Brief Microsoft is hiring senior managers to ensure its datacenters in Asia can access the energy they need.

The software giant last week advertised for three “Senior Energy Program Managers” – two in Australia and another in Singapore – who will be “responsible for strategizing and executing “end-to-end” plans for Microsoft’s energy requirement for a specific geographical market within the APAC region.”

Microsoft wants whoever gets the gigs to “Lead and implement datacenter power interconnection projects, power purchase agreement and/or energy supply contract development with utilities and third-party energy suppliers in support of Microsoft’s DC businesses in APAC and associated objectives related to capacity delivery, cost and sustainability.”

Microsoft Singapore has also advertised for a Principal Civil/Geotech Engineer to help with datacenter builds, and a regional lead to help arrange new datacenter leases across South East Asia.

Microsoft’s expanding datacenter footprint is no secret, nor is the fact that datacenters used for AI applications are power-hungry. Microsoft’s Asian outpost looks to be hiring to address those challenges, in its own facilities and third-party bit barns it rents.

Vietnamese telco Viettel on Saturday broke ground on the nation’s first chipmaking plant.

The company plans to offer foundry services on a 32-nanometer process and Viettel will target customers who want chips for industries including aerospace, telecommunications, IoT, automotive manufacturing, and medical devices.

Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh hailed the plant as a strategic moment for Vietnam, as while the nation is already home to businesses that contribute to the global semiconductor industry in many ways it lacks the ability to build chips. If Viettel’s plans stay on track, the country will close that gap in 2027 when its fab starts work.

Australia’s eSafety Commissioner last week announced that the 10 tech companies it regulates under Australia’s ban on social media for under-16s have collectively removed access to 4.7 million accounts.

eSafety Commissioner Julie Inman Grant welcomed that outcome, but said it is too early to measure the impact of the law.

“While some kids may find creative ways to stay on social media, it’s important to remember that just like other safety laws we have in society, success is measured by reduction in harm and in re-setting cultural norms,” she said. “Speed limits for instance are not a failure because some people speed. Most would agree that roads are safer because of them. Over time, compliance increases, norms settle, and the safety benefits grow.”

Bangladesh’s University of Dhaka has revealed that it deployed a Honeynet sensor – an environment designed to lure cyberattacks – that attracted hostile attention within an hour of going online.

The University joined the Asia Pacific Network Information Center’s (APNIC’s) Honeynet Project and, according to a post by network engineer Md Mahedi Hasan, recorded more than 63,000 attacks from 4,262 unique IP addresses in just 12 days.

“The time to first attack was less than one hour, and we averaged ~5,270 attacks every single day!” he wrote.

Hasan said many of the attacks “used default or common credentials” and suggested they would fail “against basic security practices.”

Indian threat intel outfit CloudSEK last week announced it won “a strategic investment from Connecticut Innovations, the strategic venture capital arm of the State of Connecticut, as part of its $10 million Series B2 round.”

The company claimed this is the first time a US state’s investment arm has put cash into an Indian infosec company.

CloudSEK has come to The Register’s attention for strong analysis of Oracle’s denial of a successful attack on its cloud, and discovery of a major data leak in India.

ASUS last week announced it won approval from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to sell its ultrasound devices in America.

The Taiwanese hardware giant said wining the approval means it will now expand into “key regions with growing demand for smart and remote healthcare – including Southeast Asia and South America – to broaden access to advanced medical technology.” ®

            <div id="article-text">These eldritch horrors presented a mundane community radio updates are the best of fiction podcasting.

These eldritch horrors presented a mundane community radio updates are the best of fiction podcasting.

It’s relatively rare for a podcast to last 14 years, especially a fiction one. In fact, as far as I can tell, Welcome to Night Vale is the longest continually running fiction podcast out there. (Some will argue it’s actually We’re Alive, but that has taken a few significant breaks between seasons.) The story of Night Vale, the titular desert town, now spans 12 seasons, over 280 episodes, three books, and at least 10 live standalone shows. While dedicating several hundred hours of your life to listening to every episode might seem like a big ask, I believe you’ll be hooked once you dive in.

The show is written by Joseph Fink and Jeffrey Cranor, who draw heavily on the work of H.P. Lovecraft. Every season has its own arc, but broadly, the show tells the story of a town that exists in an alternate version of Earth. In this town Angels are real, but acknowledging their existence is illegal; librarians are dangerous creatures with “thousands of spiny legs” and “pincers”; and there is a Faceless Old Woman who secretly lives in your home.

These are clearly unsettling concepts when taken at face value. But rather than trying to scare the listener, Cranor and Fink lean into the natural absurdity of cosmic horror and refuse to take themselves too seriously. They also routinely subvert the bigotry of their inspiration, using Lovecraftian creations to tell stories rich with LGBTQ+ characters.

Of course, having well-written scripts and telling a compelling story is only part of the equation. What elevates Welcome to Night Vale to true greatness is the cast, especially narrator Cecil Baldwin, who plays the host of the central radio show, Cecil Palmer. Cecil’s voice has the gravitas to tell ominous stories of secretive government agencies and ancient gods. But he has the range to deliver light-hearted banter with a sentient patch of haze (her name is Deb, in case you were wondering).

Cecil Baldwin has the charisma to make even the reading of a repair manual for a toaster compelling. He can be creepy, funny, or soothing, often all within the same episode. (For this reason, I don’t suggest listening to Night Vale at night. I have fallen asleep to the dulcet sounds of Baldwin’s voice several times, only for the more unsettling parts of the show to make their way into my dreams.)

Every episode also features a musical interlude in the guise of “The Weather.” The show mostly features lesser-known artists, but alumni include Jason Isbell, The Mountain Goats, Waxahatchee, Angel Olsen, Open Mike Eagle, and Sylvan Esso.

Welcome to Night Vale is also a great way to introduce younger listeners to horror. I would never suggest my eight-year-old read H.P. Lovecraft. Partly because the man’s unrepentant racism is baked into the very fabric of his stories, but also because the violence is often too much for children. Night Vale, on the other hand, takes those horrors and exposes them for what they are: entertainment. I can put the podcast on, bond with my kid over their burgeoning love of all things creepy and weird, and trust that they’ll walk away with a good message.

Welcome to Night Vale is available on most podcast platforms, including Apple Podcasts, Pocketcasts, YouTube, and Spotify.

It only affected Enterprise and IoT editions of Windows 11 23H2, and an emergency fix is already available.

Microsoft released its first security update of 2026 for Windows 11 on January 13th. Just four days later, it was forced to release an emergency out-of-band update to fix some pretty serious bugs, the first one introduced.

The security patch was stopping some systems from shutting down or hibernating properly, and also preventing some users from logging in via remote desktop. The impact of the shutdown bug was limited to machines still running Windows 11 23H2, and only those running either the Enterprise of IoT editions. Still, this is just the latest buggy update that has forced Microsoft to issue an out-of-band update, something that used to be pretty rare, but seems to be becoming increasingly common.

Microsoft has identified issues upon installing the January 2026 Windows security update. To address these issues, an out-of-band (OOB) update was released today, January 17, 2026.

- Connection and authentication failures in remote connection applications: This issue affects multiple platforms including Windows 11, version 25H2; Windows 10, version 22H2 ESU; and Windows Server 2025. See the bottom of this message for the complete list of affected products.

-Devices with Secure Launch might fail to shut down or hibernate: This issue only affects Windows 11, version 23H2.

Update January 18th: Added context specifying that only Windows 11 23H2 was affected.

Good deals are often hard to come by at the beginning of the year — which is precisely what makes Best Buy’s Winter Sale worth checking out. The ongoing sales event features discounts on everything from big-ticket OLED TVs to smaller electronics, including fitness trackers that can help you achieve your New Year’s resolutions. There are also solid deals to be had on laptops, Bose headphones, and other Verge-approved pieces of tech, many of which are matching their best prices to date.

The sale ends on January 19th, meaning you have the rest of the weekend to shop. Below, we’ve rounded up the deals — both big and small — that are genuinely worth your attention.

If you’re after a big-screen OLED, LG’s entry-level B5 Series TV remains one of the most affordable options available. And right now, it’s an even better value at Best Buy, where it has fallen to a new low of $1,499.99 ($1,500 off) in the larger 77-inch configuration.

Although it’s considered one of LG’s budget TVs and doesn’t get as bright as its pricier siblings, the B4 still delivers impressive image quality. You get rich colors, deep blacks, and great viewing angles, along with support for Dolby Vision. It supports Dolby Atmos, too, along with a solid set of gaming specs, including a 120Hz panel with a variable refresh rate, support for AMD FreeSync Premium and Nvidia G-Sync, and four HDMI 2.1 ports for connecting the latest consoles. It runs on LG’s webOS platform as well, which lets you take advantage of Amazon Alexa and provides easy access to popular streaming apps like Netflix, HBO Max, and more.

Sony’s Bravia 8 II is also worth a look if you’re okay with splurging on a high-end TV. Named “King of TV” at the Value Electronics’ 2025 TV Shootout, Sony’s Bravia 8 II delivers one of the closest theater-level experiences you can get at home. And right now, you can buy the 65-inch panel for around $2,399.99 ($900 off) from Best Buy, Amazon, and directly from Sony, which is one of its better prices to date.

John Higgins, The Verge’s new(ish) TV reviewer, said that if he had to buy a TV today, this is the one he’d choose. It delivers deep blacks, excellent shadow detail, and some of the best image processing and upscaling we’ve seen, making lower-quality 1080p content look noticeably cleaner than on rivals. The Bravia 8 II also runs Google TV, which feels more intuitive and less cluttered than LG’s webOS, and features a 120Hz panel with two HDMI 2.1 ports for 4K gaming at 120Hz, plus two HDMI 2.0 ports capped at 4K / 60Hz. It doesn’t support Nvidia G-Sync or AMD FreeSync Premium, but for watching movies and TV shows, it’s one of the best OLEDs you can buy.

Bose’s first-gen flagships are a replacement for the Noise Cancelling Headphones 700 that offer a more travel-friendly design, spatial audio, better call quality, excellent comfort, and some of the best noise cancellation around.

If you’re looking for an excellent pair of noise-canceling headphones that are easy to take on the go, Bose’s first-gen QuietComfort Ultra Headphones are on sale in select colors for $279 ($150 off) at Best Buy, matching their all-time low. Bose is also offering the over-ear headphones at that price, though, again, only in select colors.

The original QC Ultra remain our favorite pair for travel, thanks to a foldable design that makes them easy to pack, a lightweight and comfortable fit, and battery life that lasts up to 24 hours. They also deliver top-tier ANC and pleasing sound, with an Immersive Audio feature that isn’t always consistent but works well when it does. Plus, you get a natural-sounding transparency mode for when you want to let outside sound in. If you’re fine skipping newer upgrades found in the second-gen model, such as support for lossless audio over USB, the first-gen pair are a great value — especially since they’re currently about $100 cheaper.

The Amazfit Active 2 delivers outsized value for the price. It looks spiffy and has a wide array of health tracking features, plus built-in GPS and AI chatbots to provide extra context to your data. Read our review.

If you’re looking for a great all-around fitness tracker, the Amazfit Active 2 is still available for $84.99 ($15 off) at Best Buy, Amazon, and Target, which is just $5 shy of its lowest price to date.

The Active 2, which is currently our favorite fitness tracker, delivers far more than you’d expect at this price. It features a comfortable design with a chic stainless steel case and a bright, tempered-glass OLED display, along with up to nine days of battery life. It covers all the basics and then some, too, allowing you to leverage more premium features like menstrual cycle tracking, abnormal heart rate notifications, continuous heart rate and blood oxygen monitoring, and detailed sleep tracking. You also get support for more than 160 sport types, including a strength training mode that counts reps for you, as well as offline maps with turn-by-turn navigation.

Speaking of Bose, Best Buy is also currently selling the latest Bose SoundLink Micro for a new low of $99 ($30 off), with retailers like Amazon and Walmart matching said price.

Bose’s pocketable Bluetooth speaker delivers solid sound for its size and even lets you adjust EQ through a companion app, unlike the first-gen model. It also offers up to 12 hours of battery life, recharges quickly via USB-C, and is surprisingly rugged thanks to an IP67 rating for dust and water resistance. A built-in strap lets you easily attach it to a bag or bike, too, and if you already own a compatible Bose speaker or soundbar, you can pair the two together — or link a second-gen SoundLink Micro for stereo sound.

It’s first in the series to support multitouch for controlling two effects at once.

The Kaoss Pad has seen many different iterations, but the mainline effect unit and sampler hasn’t received an update since the launch of the KP3+ in 2013. Korg has finally given it the attention it deserves with the release of the Kaoss Pad V. Rather than a dramatic reimagining of what a Kaoss Pad is, the V takes the core idea — an effect unit with an X / Y pad for controlling parameters in a natural, performance-focused way.

The big innovation on the Kaoss Pad V is that it can recognize two fingers simultaneously to control two distinct sets of parameters, or even two entirely different effects. It also has a dedicated voice effects engine for vocoding and harmonizing. It can even convert vocal input into MIDI for controlling other gear. Imagine being able to control a drum machine by beatboxing, or a synth by humming.

The sampling and looping features have also been improved. You can record up to eight bars, overdub, and even chop and rearrange your loop. Those looping features are all the more useful since Korg finally added a balanced input so you can capture cleaner audio from mics, synths, and other instruments. Though, it sticks with unbalanced RCA ins and outs on the back, which are more useful for DJ setups, but less so in a studio.

One thing that has not gotten an upgrade, unfortunately, in 13 years is the price. The KP3+ launched at $349.99 in 2013, which, accounting for inflation, is about $493 in 2026 money. But the Korg Kaoss Pad V is for preorder at a whoping $649.99.

The powerful exchange yanked its support of the Senate CLARITY Act at the last minute — and the rest of the crypto world, from Kraken to a16z, is infuriated.

January was going to be a landmark month for the crypto industry. The Senate would start negotiating the finer details of the CLARITY Act, a major law that would finally enshrine the fundamental structure of how the crypto market could legally operate in the United States: what digital assets counted as a security versus a commodity, what regulatory responsibilities companies had to abide by, what legal protections consumers could have. The House had already passed their version months ago. The White House was ready to sign it. Democrats and Republicans seemed to agree on the bill’s fundamentals.

And crypto, which had spent decades navigating a regulatory gray zone, would finally have a set of rules to work off of — maybe not perfect rules, but hard rules. “[We] don’t want to be in a place where, with the change of every administration, what you can and can’t do with software, or what you can and can’t publish, changes,” Connor Brown, the Head of Strategy for the Bitcoin Policy Institute, told The Verge.

Last Wednesday, just before midnight, everything fell apart.

Hours before the Senate Banking Committee would have convened for markup on Thursday — the period where a group of Republicans and Democrats would negotiate over every single word, clause, and amendment in the hundred-plus draft, to prepare it for a final Senate vote — Coinbase, the world’s biggest crypto exchange, announced that having reviewed the final draft of the bill, they were withdrawing their support for the CLARITY Act altogether.

“We’d rather have no bill than a bad bill,” CEO Brian Armstrong said on X, and later pinned the blame on a third party: the big banks, whose lobbyists had swooped in at the last minute to curb the threat of customers storing their money in crypto wallets instead of savings accounts.

Armstrong had several specific objections, but one hill Coinbase seems prepared to die on: whether crypto owners would be able to earn interest or other rewards off of holding stablecoins, a token whose price was pegged to the value of the US dollar, in the way that consumers could earn interest from money deposited in traditional bank accounts. (Coinbase did not return a request for comment.)

Banking committee chairman Tim Scott (R-SC) immediately cancelled the markup, just a “brief pause” to renegotiate. Lobbyists began calling around and analysts began dissecting the draft. But notably, the vast majority of crypto’s biggest players, from exchanges to investors, publicly announced that they would support the Senate bill, and implicitly bashed Coinbase for derailing its passage.

“Reasonable people can disagree on specific provisions. That is precisely why the final stage of this process matters,” Kraken CEO Arjun Sethi said on Thursday, reaffirming his support of the CLARITY Act. “The right response to outstanding issues is to resolve them not to abandon years of bipartisan progress and start over from scratch.” His sentiment was shared by a16z managing partner Chris Dixon, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse, and even David Sacks, the powerful White House special advisor on AI and Crypto, who urged Coinbase to “resolve any remaining differences” before the end of the month.

While the rest of the industry is willing to deal with the problems Armstrong pointed out in exchange for having a law, Coinbase — a publicly-traded company that offers yield-bearing stablecoin accounts — would suffer the most if the interest issue remains intact. But there is a real deadline to lock in any sort of meaningful crypto legislation, and it starts the moment that members of Congress begin running for re-election.

Midterm elections are generally guaranteed to kill any incentive for bipartisan consensus, but especially so in this cycle, where elected officials will have to face furious constituents who might see support of CLARITY as a proxy for supporting Trump. It doesn’t help that the Senate Republicans are trying to box out a Democrat-written provision that would prevent Trump from profiting off of crypto assets. Campaigns start in March, and the Senate is not in session next week, giving them less than a month to hammer out any issues before switching to campaign mode.

That is an exceedingly short amount of time for the Banking Committee to renegotiate new language, mark up that bill, send it to the Senate Agriculture Committee (which is responsible for regulating commodities), and negotiate even further before it even hits the Senate floor for a full vote. And “floor time” — when the Senate can summon all 100 members to vote for a bill in person — is an increasingly rare commodity before the election season. (Most of it will likely be burned on averting yet another government shutdown.)

Punting the bill to next year isn’t a safe option, either. It’s widely expected that the Republicans will lose either the House or the Senate, giving Democrats the means to block CLARITY’s passage for whatever reason they cite. And while the current president might be a steadfast ally to the crypto industry, there’s no telling who will come after him, much less how they’d feel about crypto.

“Will we ever have a setup as favorable as we do right now? Hard to imagine,” Seth Hertlein, the global head of policy at Ledger. “Could it happen? Sure, maybe, nobody knows. But there’s definitely a sense that if we don’t get it done now, either it’s not going to happen, or it will happen on much less favorable terms.”

In the meantime, however, DC policymakers are frustrated that Coinbase reopened a debate that had seemingly been settled last year: the House had already spent years writing and negotiating a crypto market structure bill, which passed last August with an overwhelmingly bipartisan vote. In the defense of Coinbase, the Senate’s version now had to contend with the demands of the finance industry, which had not initially weighed in on crypto market structure until late last year, as well as the progressive Democrat Senators on the committee. And, of course, the Senate had insisted on writing its own version of the bill instead of working off the House’s version.

“The Senate is where House bills go to die,” said Hertlein. “That’s a common Washington bubble joke.”

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">This is The Stepback, a weekly newsletter breaking down one essential story from the tech world. For more on dystopian developments in AI, follow Hayden Field. The Stepback arrives in our subscribers’ inboxes at 8AM ET. Opt in for The Stepback here.

You could say it all started with Elon Musk’s AI FOMO — and his crusade against “wokeness.” When his AI company, xAI, announced Grok in November 2023, it was described as a chatbot with “a rebellious streak” and the ability to “answer spicy questions that are rejected by most other AI systems.” The chatbot debuted after a few months of development and just two months of training, and the announcement highlighted that Grok would have real-time knowledge of the X platform.

But there are inherent risks to a chatbot having both the run of the internet and X, and it’s safe to say xAI may not have taken the necessary steps to address them. Since Musk took over Twitter in 2022 and renamed it X, he laid off 30% of its global trust and safety staff and cut its number of safety engineers by 80%, Australia’s online safety watchdog said last January. As for xAI, when Grok was released, it was unclear whether xAI had a safety team already in place. When Grok 4 was released in July, it took more than a month for the company to release a model card — a practice typically seen as an industry standard, which details safety tests and potential concerns. Two weeks after Grok 4’s release, an xAI employee wrote on X that he was hiring for xAI’s safety team and that they “urgently need strong engineers/researchers.” In response to a commenter, who asked, “xAI does safety?” the original employee said xAI was “working on it.”

Journalist Kat Tenbarge wrote about how she first started seeing sexually explicit deepfakes go viral on Grok in June 2023. Those images obviously weren’t created by Grok — it didn’t even have the ability to generate images until August 2024 — but X’s response to the concerns was varied. Even last January, Grok was inciting controversy for AI-generated images. And this past August, Grok’s “spicy” video-generation mode created nude deepfakes of Taylor Swift without even being asked. Experts have told The Verge since September that the company takes a whack-a-mole approach to safety and guardrails — and that it’s difficult enough to keep an AI system on the straight and narrow when you design it with safety in mind from the beginning, let alone if you’re going back to fix baked-in problems. Now, it seems that approach has blown up in xAI’s face.

Grok has spent the last couple of weeks spreading nonconsensual, sexualized deepfakes of adults and minors all over the platform, as promoted. Screenshots show Grok complying with users asking it to replace women’s clothing with lingerie and make them spread their legs, as well as to put small children in bikinis. And there are even more egregious reports. It’s gotten so bad that during a 24-hour analysis of Grok-created images on X, one estimate gauged the chatbot to be generating about 6,700 sexually suggestive or “nudifying” images per hour. Part of the reason for the onslaught is a recent feature added to Grok, allowing users to use an “edit” button to ask the chatbot to change images, without the original poster’s consent.

Since then, we’ve seen a handful of countries either investigate the matter or threaten to ban X altogether. Members of the French government promised an investigation, as did the Indian IT ministry, and a Malaysian government commission wrote a letter about its concerns. California governor Gavin Newsom called on the US Attorney General to investigate xAI. The United Kingdom said it is planning to pass a law banning the creation of AI-generated nonconsensual, sexualized images, and the country’s communications-industry regulator said it would investigate both X and the images that had been generated in order to see if they violated its Online Safety Act. And this week, both Malaysia and Indonesia blocked access to Grok.

xAI initially said its goal for Grok was to “assist humanity in its quest for understanding and knowledge,” “maximally benefit all of humanity,” and “empower our users with our AI tools, subject to the law,” as well as to “serve as a powerful research assistant for anyone.” That’s a far cry from generating nude-adjacent deepfakes of women without their consent, let alone minors.

On Wednesday evening, as pressure on the company heightened, X’s Safety account put out a statement that the platform has “implemented technological measures to prevent the Grok account from allowing the editing of images of real people in revealing clothing such as bikinis,” and that the restriction “applies to all users, including paid subscribers.” On top of that, only paid subscribers can use Grok to create or edit any sort of image moving forward, according to X. The statement went on to say that X “now geoblock[s] the ability of all users to generate images of real people in bikinis, underwear, and similar attire via the Grok account and in Grok in X in those jurisdictions where it’s illegal,” which was a strange point to make since earlier in the statement, the company said it was not allowing anyone to use Grok to edit images in such a way.

Another important point: My colleagues tested Grok’s image-generation restrictions on Wednesday to find that it took less than a minute to get around most guardrails. Although asking the chatbot to “put her in a bikini” or “remove her clothes” produced censored results, they found, it had no qualms about delivering on prompts like “show me her cleavage,” “make her breasts bigger,” and “put her in a crop top and low-rise shorts,” as well as generating images in lingerie and sexualized poses. As of Wednesday evening, we were still able to get the Grok app to generate revealing images of people, using a free account.

Even after X’s Wednesday statement, we may see a number of other countries either ban or block access to either all of X or just Grok, at least temporarily. We’ll also see how the proposed laws and investigations around the world play out. The pressure is mounting for Musk, who on Wednesday afternoon took to X to say that he is “not aware of any naked underage images generated by Grok.” Hours later, X’s Safety team put out its statement, saying it’s “working around the clock to add additional safeguards, take swift and decisive action to remove violating and illegal content, permanently suspend accounts where appropriate, and collaborate with local governments and law enforcement as necessary.”

What technically is and isn’t against the law is a big question here. For instance, experts told The Verge earlier this month that AI-generated images of identifiable minors in bikinis, or potentially even naked, may not technically be illegal under current child sexual abuse material (CSAM) laws in the US, though of course disturbing and unethical. But lascivious images of minors in such situations are against the law. We’ll see if those definitions expand or change, even though the current laws are a bit of a patchwork.

As for nonconsensual intimate deepfakes of adult women, the Take It Down Act, signed into law in May 2025, bars nonconsensual AI-generated “intimate visual depictions” and requires certain platforms to rapidly remove them. The grace period before the latter part goes into effect — requiring platforms to actually remove them — ends in May 2026, so we may see some significant developments in the next six months.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">It was early evening in Berlin, just a day before Christmas Eve, when Josephine Ballon got an unexpected email from US Customs and Border Protection. The status of her ability to travel to the United States had changed—she’d no longer be able to enter the country.

At first, she couldn’t find any information online as to why, though she had her suspicions. She was one of the directors of HateAid, a small German nonprofit founded to support the victims of online harassment and violence. As the organization has become a strong advocate of EU tech regulations, it has increasingly found itself attacked in campaigns from right-wing politicians and provocateurs who claim that it engages in censorship.

It was only later that she saw what US Secretary of State Marco Rubio had posted on X:

For far too long, ideologues in Europe have led organized efforts to coerce American platforms to punish American viewpoints they oppose. The Trump Administration will no longer tolerate these egregious acts of extraterritorial censorship.Today, @StateDept will take steps toâ€¦

Rubio was promoting a conspiracy theory about what he has called the “censorship-industrial complex,” which alleges widespread collusion between the US government, tech companies, and civil society organizations to silence conservative voices—the very conspiracy theory HateAid has recently been caught up in.

Then Undersecretary of State Sarah B. Rogers posted on X the names of the individuals targeted by travel bans. The list included Ballon, as well as her HateAid co-director, Anna Lena von Hodenberg. Also named were three others doing similar or related work: former EU commissioner Thierry Breton, who had helped author Europe’s Digital Services Act (DSA); Imran Ahmed of the Center for Countering Digital Hate, which documents hate speech on social media platforms; and Clare Melford of the Global Disinformation Index, which provides risk ratings warning advertisers about placing ads on websites promoting hate speech and disinformation.

It was an escalation in the Trump administration’s war on digital rights—fought in the name of free speech. But EU officials, freedom of speech experts, and the five individuals targeted all flatly reject the accusations of censorship. Ballon, von Hodenberg, and some of their clients tell me that their work is fundamentally about making people feel safer online. And their experiences over the past few weeks show just how politicized and besieged their work in online safety has become. They almost certainly won’t be the last people targeted in this way.

Ballon was the one to tell von Hodenberg that both their names were on the list. “We kind of felt a chill in our bones,” von Hodenberg told me when I caught up with the pair in early January.

But she added that they also quickly realized, “Okay, it’s the old playbook to silence us.” So they got to work—starting with challenging the narrative the US government was pushing about them.

Within a few hours, Ballon and von Hodenberg had issued a strongly worded statement refuting the allegations: “We will not be intimidated by a government that uses accusations of censorship to silence those who stand up for human rights and freedom of expression,” they wrote. “We demand a clear signal from the German government and the European Commission that this is unacceptable. Otherwise, no civil society organisation, no politician, no researcher, and certainly no individual will dare to denounce abuses by US tech companies in the future.”

Those signals came swiftly. On X, Johann Wadephul, the German foreign minister, called the entry bans “not acceptable,” adding that “the DSA was democratically adopted by the EU, for the EU—it does not have extraterritorial effect.” Also on X, French president Emmanuel Macron wrote that “these measures amount to intimidation and coercion aimed at undermining European digital sovereignty.” The European Commission issued a statement that it “strongly condemns” the Trump administration’s actions and reaffirmed its “sovereign right to regulate economic activity in line with our democratic values.”

Ahmed, Melford, Breton, and their respective organizations also made their own statements denouncing the entry bans. Ahmed, the only one of the five based in the United States, also successfully filed suit to preempt any attempts to detain him, which the State Department had indicated it would consider doing.

But alongside the statements of solidarity, Ballon and von Hodenberg said, they also received more practical advice: Assume the travel ban was just the start and that more consequences could be coming. Service providers might preemptively revoke access to their online accounts; banks might restrict their access to money or the global payment system; they might see malicious attempts to get hold of their personal data or that of their clients. Perhaps, allies told them, they should even consider moving their money into friends’ accounts or keeping cash on hand so that they could pay their team’s salaries—and buy their families’ groceries.

These warnings felt particularly urgent given that just days before, the Trump administration had sanctioned two International Criminal Court judges for “illegitimate targeting of Israel.” As a result, they had lost access to many American tech platforms, including Microsoft, Amazon, and Gmail.

“If Microsoft does that to someone who is a lot more important than we are,” Ballon told me, “they will not even blink to shut down the email accounts from some random human rights organization in Germany.”

“We have now this dark cloud over us that any minute, something can happen,” von Hodenberg added. “We’re running against time to take the appropriate measures.”

Founded in 2018 to support people experiencing digital violence, HateAid has since evolved to defend digital rights more broadly. It provides ways for people to report illegal online content and offers victims advice, digital security, emotional support, and help with evidence preservation. It also educates German police, prosecutors, and politicians about how to handle online hate crimes.

Once the group is contacted for help, and if its lawyers determine that the type of harassment has likely violated the law, the organization connects victims with legal counsel who can help them file civil and criminal lawsuits against perpetrators, and if necessary, helps finance the cases. (HateAid itself does not file cases against individuals.) Ballon and von Hodenberg estimate that HateAid has worked with around 7,500 victims and helped them file 700 criminal cases and 300 civil cases, mostly against individual offenders.

For 23-year-old German law student and outspoken political activist Theresia Crone, HateAid’s support has meant that she has been able to regain some sense of agency in her life, both on and offline. She had reached out after she discovered entire online forums dedicated to making deepfakes of her. Without HateAid, she told me, “I would have had to either put my faith into the police and the public prosecutor to prosecute this properly, or I would have had to foot the bill of an attorney myself”—a huge financial burden for “a student with basically no fixed income.”

In addition, working alone would have been retraumatizing: “I would have had to document everything by myself,” she said—meaning “I would have had to see all of these pictures again and again.”

“The internet is a lawless place,” Ballon told me when we first spoke, back in mid-December, a few weeks before the travel ban was announced. In a conference room at the HateAid office in Berlin, she said there are many cases that “cannot even be prosecuted, because no perpetrator is identified.” That’s why the nonprofit also advocates for better laws and regulations governing technology companies in Germany and across the European Union.

On occasion, they have also engaged in strategic litigation against the platforms themselves. In 2023, for example, HateAid and the European Union of Jewish Students sued X for failing to enforce its terms of service against posts that were antisemitic or that denied the Holocaust, which is illegal in Germany.

This almost certainly put the organization in the crosshairs of X owner Elon Musk; it also made HateAid a frequent target of Germany’s far right party, the Alliance for Democracy, which Musk has called “the only hope for Germany.” (X did not respond to a request to comment on this lawsuit.)

For better and worse, HateAid’s profile grew further when it took on another critical job in online safety. In June 2024, it was named as a trusted flagger organization under the Digital Services Act, a 2022 EU law that requires social media companies to remove certain content (including hate speech and violence) that violates national laws, and to provide more transparency to the public, in part by allowing more appeals on platforms’ moderation decisions.

Trusted flaggers are entities designated by individual EU countries to point out illegal content, and they are a key part of DSA enforcement. While anyone can report such content, trusted flaggers’ reports are prioritized and legally require a response from the platforms.

The Trump administration has loudly argued that the trusted flagger program and the DSA more broadly are examples of censorship that disproportionately affect voices on the right and American technology companies, like X.

When we first spoke in December, Ballon said these claims of censorship simply don’t hold water: “We don’t delete content, and we also don’t, like, flag content publicly for everyone to see and to shame people. The only thing that we do: We use the same notification channels that everyone can use, and the only thing that is in the Digital Services Act is that platforms should prioritize our reporting.” Then it is on the platforms to decide what to do.

Nevertheless, the idea that HateAid and like-minded organizations are censoring the right has become a powerful conspiracy theory with real-world consequences. (Last year, MIT Technology Review covered the closure of a small State Department office following allegations that it had conducted “censorship,” as well as an unusual attempt by State leadership to access internal records related to supposed censorship—including information about two of the people who have now been banned, Medford and Ahmed, and both of their organizations.)

HateAid saw a fresh wave of harassment starting last February, when 60 Minutes aired a documentary on hate speech laws in Germany; it featured a quote from Ballon that “free speech needs boundaries,” which, she added, “are part of our constitution.” The interview happened to air just days before Vice President JD Vance attended the Munich Security Conference; there he warned that “across Europe, free speech … is in retreat.” This, Ballon told me, led to heightened hostility toward her and her organization.

Fast-forward to July, when a report by Republicans in the US House of Representatives claimed that the DSA “compels censorship and infringes on American free speech.” HateAid was explicitly named in the report.

All of this has made its work “more dangerous,” Ballon told me in December. Before the 60 Minutes interview, “maybe one and a half years ago, as an organization, there were attacks against us, but mostly against our clients, because they were the activists, the journalists, the politicians at the forefront. But now … we see them becoming more personal.”

As a result, over the last year, HateAid has taken more steps to protect its reputation and get ahead of the damaging narratives. Ballon has reported the hate speech targeted at her—“More [complaints] than in all the years I did this job before,” she said—as well as defamation lawsuits on behalf of HateAid.

All these tensions finally came to a head in December. At the start of the month, the European Commission fined X $140 million for DSA violations. This set off yet another round of recriminations about supposed censorship of the right, with Trump calling the fine “a nasty one” and warning: “Europe has to be very careful.”

Just a few weeks later, the day before Christmas Eve, retaliation against individuals finally arrived.

Digital rights groups are pushing back against the Trump administration’s narrow view of what constitutes free speech and censorship.

“What we see from this administration is a conception of freedom of expression that is not a human-rights-based conception where this is an inalienable, indelible right that’s held by every person,” says David Greene, the civil liberties director of the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a US-based digital rights group. Rather, he sees an “expectation that… [if] anybody else&#39;s speech is challenged, there&#39;s a good reason for it, but it should never happen to them.”

Since Trump won his second term, social media platforms have walked back their commitments to trust and safety. Meta, for example, ended fact-checking on Facebook and adopted much of the administration’s censorship language, with CEO Mark Zuckerberg telling the podcaster Joe Rogan that it would “work with President Trump to push back on governments around the world” if they are seen as “going after American companies and pushing to censor more.”

And as the recent fines on X show, Musk’s platform has gone even further in flouting European law—and, ultimately, ignoring the user rights that the DSA was written to protect. In perhaps one of the most egregious examples yet, in recent weeks X allowed people to use Grok, its AI generator, to create nonconsensual nude images of women and children, with few limits—and, so far at least, few consequences. (Last week, X released a statement that it would start limiting users&#39; ability to create explicit images with Grok; in response to a number of questions, X representative Rosemarie Esposito pointed me to that statement.)

For Ballon, it makes perfect sense: “You can better make money if you don’t have to implement safety measures and don’t have to invest money in making your platform the safest place,” she told me.

“It goes both ways,” von Hodenberg added. “It’s not only the platforms who profit from the US administration undermining European laws … but also, obviously, the US administration also has a huge interest in not regulating the platforms … because who is amplified right now? It’s the extreme right.”

She believes this explains why HateAid—and Ahmed’s Center for Countering Digital Hate and Melford’s Global Disinformation Index, as well as Breton and the DSA—have been targeted: They are working to disrupt this “unholy deal where the platforms profit economically and the US administration is profiting in dividing the European Union,” she said.

The travel restrictions intentionally send a strong message to all groups that work to hold tech companies accountable. “It’s purely vindictive,” Greene says. “It’s designed to punish people from pursuing further work on disinformation or anti-hate work.” (The State Department did not respond to a request for comment.)

And ultimately, this has a broad effect on who feels safe enough to participate online.

Ballon pointed to research that shows the “silencing effect” of harassment and hate speech, not only for “those who have been attacked,” but also for those who witness such attacks. This is particularly true for women, who tend to face more online hate that is also more sexualized and violent. It’ll only be worse if groups like HateAid get deplatformed or lose funding.

Von Hodenberg put it more bluntly: “They reclaim freedom of speech for themselves when they want to say whatever they want, but they silence and censor the ones that criticize them.”

Still, the HateAid directors insist they’re not backing down. They say they’re taking “all advice” they have received seriously, especially with regard to “becoming more independent from service providers,” Ballon told me.

“Part of the reason that they don’t like us is because we are strengthening our clients and empowering them,” said von Hodenberg. “We are making sure that they are not succeeding, and not withdrawing from the public debate.”

“So when they think they can silence us by attacking us? That is just a very wrong perception.”

Depending who you ask, AI-powered coding is either giving software developers an unprecedented productivity boost or churning out masses of poorly designed code that saps their attention and sets software projects up for serious long term-maintenance problems.

The problem is right now, it’s not easy to know which is true.

As tech giants pour billions into large language models (LLMs), coding has been touted as the technology’s killer app. Executives enamored with the potential are pushing engineers to lean into an AI-powered future. But after speaking to more than 30 developers, technology executives, analysts, and researchers, MIT Technology Review found that the picture is not as straightforward as it might seem. Read the full story.

“I am very annoyed. I’m very disappointed. I’m seriously frustrated.”

Technically speaking, neuroscientists have been able to read your mind for decades. It’s not easy, mind you. First, you must lie motionless within a fMRI scanner, perhaps for hours, while you watch films or listen to audiobooks.

If you do elect to endure claustrophobic hours in the scanner, the software will learn to generate a bespoke reconstruction of what you were seeing or listening to, just by analyzing how blood moves through your brain.

More recently, researchers have deployed generative AI tools, like Stable Diffusion and GPT, to create far more realistic, if not entirely accurate, reconstructions of films and podcasts based on neural activity. So how close are we to genuine “mind reading?” Read the full story.

            <h2>Three technologies that will shape biotech in 2026</h2>
            <p><strong>MIT Technology Review | 2026-01-16</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2026/01/16/1131363/three-technologies-shape-biotech-in-2026-gene-editing-embryo-scoring/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Earlier this week, MIT Technology Review published its annual list of Ten Breakthrough Technologies. As always, it features technologies that made the news last year, and which—for better or worse—stand to make waves in the coming years. They’re the technologies you should really be paying attention to.

This year’s list includes tech that’s set to transform the energy industry, artificial intelligence, space travel—and of course biotech and health. Our breakthrough biotechnologies for 2026 involve editing a baby’s genes and, separately, resurrecting genes from ancient species. We also included a controversial technology that offers parents the chance to screen their embryos for characteristics like height and intelligence. Here’s the story behind our biotech choices.

In August 2024, KJ Muldoon was born with a rare genetic disorder that allowed toxic ammonia to build up in his blood. The disease can be fatal, and KJ was at risk of developing neurological disorders. At the time, his best bet for survival involved waiting for a liver transplant.

Then he was offered an experimental gene therapy—a personalized “base editing” treatment designed to correct the specific genetic “misspellings” responsible for his disease. It seems to have worked! Three doses later, KJ is doing well. He took his first steps in December, shortly before spending his first Christmas at home.

KJ’s story is hugely encouraging. The team behind his treatment is planning a clinical trial for infants with similar disorders caused by different genetic mutations. The team members hope to win regulatory approval on the back of a small trial—a move that could make the expensive treatment (KJ’s cost around $1 million) more accessible, potentially within a few years.

Others are getting in on the action, too. Fyodor Urnov, a gene-editing scientist at the University of California, Berkeley, assisted the team that developed KJ’s treatment. He recently cofounded Aurora Therapeutics, a startup that hopes to develop gene-editing drugs for another disorder called phenylketonuria (PKU). The goal is to obtain regulatory approval for a single drug that can then be adjusted or personalized for individuals without having to go through more clinical trials.

US regulators seem to be amenable to the idea and have described a potential approval pathway for such “bespoke, personalized therapies.” Watch this space.

It was a big year for Colossal Biosciences, the biotech company hoping to “de-extinct” animals like the woolly mammoth and the dodo. In March, the company created what it called “woolly mice”—rodents with furry coats and curly whiskers akin to those of woolly mammoths.

The company made an even more dramatic claim the following month, when it announced it had created three dire wolves. These striking snow-white animals were created by making 20 genetic changes to the DNA of gray wolves based on genetic research on ancient dire wolf bones, the company said at the time.

Whether these animals can really be called dire wolves is debatable, to say the least. But the technology behind their creation is undeniably fascinating. We’re talking about the extraction and analysis of ancient DNA, which can then be introduced into cells from other, modern-day species.

Analysis of ancient DNA can reveal all sorts of fascinating insights into human ancestors and other animals. And cloning, another genetic tool used here, has applications not only in attempts to re-create dead pets but also in wildlife conservation efforts. Read more here.

IVF involves creating embryos in a lab and, typically, “scoring” them on their likelihood of successful growth before they are transferred to a person’s uterus. So far, so uncontroversial.

Recently, embryo scoring has evolved. Labs can pinch off a couple of cells from an embryo, look at its DNA, and screen for some genetic diseases. That list of diseases is increasing. And now some companies are taking things even further, offering prospective parents the opportunity to select embryos for features like height, eye color, and even IQ.

This is controversial for lots of reasons. For a start, there are many, many factors that contribute to complex traits like IQ (a score that doesn’t capture all aspects of intelligence at any rate). We don’t have a perfect understanding of those factors, or how selecting for one trait might influence another.

Some critics warn of eugenics. And others note that whichever embryo you end up choosing, you can’t control exactly how your baby will turn out (and why should you?!). Still, that hasn’t stopped Nucleus, one of the companies offering these services, from inviting potential customers to have their “best baby.” Read more here.

In April 2025, Ronald Deibert left all electronic devices at home in Toronto and boarded a plane. When he landed in Illinois, he bought a new laptop and iPhone. He wanted to reduce the risk of having his personal devices confiscated, because he knew his work made him a prime target for surveillance. “I’m traveling under the assumption that I am being watched, right down to exactly where I am at any moment,” Deibert says.

Deibert directs the Citizen Lab, a research center he founded in 2001 to serve as “counterintelligence for civil society.” Housed at the University of Toronto, it’s one of the few institutions that investigate cyberthreats exclusively in the public interest, and in doing so, it has exposed some of the most egregious digital abuses of the past two decades.

For many years, Deibert and his colleagues have held up the US as the standard for liberal democracy. But that’s changing. Read the full story.

As thousands of companies trumpet their plans to cut carbon pollution, a small group of sustainability consultants has emerged as the go-to arbiter of corporate climate action.

The Science Based Targets initiative, or SBTi, helps businesses develop a timetable for action to shrink their climate footprint through some combination of cutting greenhouse-gas pollution and removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. After years of small-scale sustainability work, SBTi is growing rapidly, and governments are paying attention.

But while the group has earned praise for reeling the private sector into constructive conversations about climate emissions, its rising influence has also attracted scrutiny and raised questions about why a single organization is setting the standards for many of the world’s largest companies.

            <div id="article-text">Happy New Year! I know it’s a bit late to say, but it never quite feels like the year has started until the new edition of our 10 Breakthrough Technologies list comes out.

For 25 years, MIT Technology Review has put together this package, which highlights the technologies that we think are going to matter in the future. This year’s version has some stars, including gene resurrection (remember all the dire wolf hype last year?) and commercial space stations.

And of course, the world of climate and energy is represented with sodium-ion batteries, next-generation nuclear, and hyperscale AI data centers. Let’s take a look at what ended up on the list, and what it says about this moment for climate tech.

I’ve been covering sodium-ion batteries for years, but this moment feels like a breakout one for the technology.

Today, lithium-ion cells power everything from EVs, phones, and computers to huge stationary storage arrays that help support the grid. But researchers and battery companies have been racing to develop an alternative, driven by the relative scarcity of lithium and the metal’s volatile price in recent years.

Sodium-ion batteries could be that alternative. Sodium is much more abundant than lithium, and it could unlock cheaper batteries that hold a lower fire risk.

There are limitations here: Sodium-ion batteries won’t be able to pack as much energy into cells as their lithium counterparts. But it might not matter, especially for grid storage and smaller EVs.

In recent years, we’ve seen a ton of interest in sodium-based batteries, particularly from major companies in China. Now the new technology is starting to make its way into the world—CATL says it started manufacturing these batteries at scale in 2025.

Nuclear reactors are an important part of grids around the world today—massive workhorse reactors generate reliable, consistent electricity. But the countries with the oldest and most built-out fleets have struggled to add to them in recent years, since reactors are massive and cost billions. Recent high-profile projects have gone way over budget and faced serious delays.

Next-generation reactor designs could help the industry break out of the old blueprint and get more nuclear power online more quickly, and they’re starting to get closer to becoming reality.

There’s a huge variety of proposals when it comes to what’s next for nuclear. Some companies are building smaller reactors, which they say could make it easier to finance new projects, and get them done on time.

Other companies are focusing on tweaking key technical bits of reactors, using alternative fuels or coolants that help ferry heat out of the reactor core. These changes could help reactors generate electricity more efficiently and safely.

Kairos Power was the first US company to receive approval to begin construction on a next-generation reactor to produce electricity. China is emerging as a major center of nuclear development, with the country’s national nuclear company reportedly working on several next-gen reactors.

This one isn’t quite what I would call a climate technology, but I spent most of last year reporting on the climate and environmental impacts of AI, and the AI boom is deeply intertwined with climate and energy.

Data centers aren’t new, but we’re seeing a wave of larger centers being proposed and built to support the rise of AI. Some of these facilities require a gigawatt or more of power—that’s like the output of an entire conventional nuclear power plant, just for one data center.

(This feels like a good time to mention that our Breakthrough Technologies list doesn’t just highlight tech that we think will have a straightforwardly positive influence on the world. I think back to our 2023 list, which included mass-market military drones.)

There’s no denying that new, supersize data centers are an important force driving electricity demand, sparking major public pushback, and emerging as a key bit of our new global infrastructure.

            <h2>Sequoia’s big bet on Anthropic</h2>
            <p><strong>The Next Web | 2026-01-19</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://thenextweb.com/news/sequoia-joins-anthropics-25b-funding-round">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Venture capital powerhouse Sequoia Capital is preparing to invest in Anthropic, the AI startup best known for its Claude family of large language models, in one of the largest private funding rounds in tech this year. The deal is being led by Singapore’s GIC and U.S. investor Coatue, each contributing roughly $1.5 billion, as part of a planned raise of $25 billion or more at a staggering $350 billion valuation.

This move stands out for two reasons: the size and speed of the valuation surge and the fact that Sequoia, already an investor in rival AI builders such as OpenAI and Elon Musk’s xAI, is broadening its exposure across competing AI platforms.

Traditionally, top-tier VC firms have avoided backing direct competitors simultaneously. The logic was simple: protect information flows and avoid internal conflicts of interest. Sequoia’s willingness to back Anthropic despite existing stakes in other AI outfits signals a shift in how investors view the AI market. It reflects a belief that the sector is large enough to support multiple winners rather than requiring firms to choose a single champion.

Anthropic itself has grown quickly since its founding by former OpenAI researchers. Industry reporting shows the company has attracted significant talent from established AI labs and introduced advanced models and enterprise features, contributing to its rapid valuation climb over the past year.

TNW City Coworking space - Where your best work happens

A workspace designed for growth, collaboration, and endless networking opportunities in the heart of tech.

A $350 billion valuation, even before a public listing, is eye-watering. It resets expectations for what private AI companies can command and puts pressure on competitors to secure equally large capital backing or risk falling behind. Analysts suggest that few AI firms may go public at these valuations, pointing instead to continued private rounds or alternative exit strategies if market sentiment shifts.

That dynamic is a symptom of a broader trend: a global AI capital rush that has persisted even amid concerns about a bust cycle or a funding slowdown in other tech segments. Investors remain convinced that AI will reshape industries from software to logistics, health care, and beyond, and are willing to deploy extraordinary sums to secure influence in that future.

For European markets and founders, the Sequoia-Anthropic deal carries both opportunities and warnings. Europe has strong academic AI talent, an active startup ecosystem, and deep expertise in areas like robotics, industrial automation, and data privacy.

Yet venture capital density still trails the U.S., and marquee AI funding rounds of this scale are rare on the continent.
This investment could accelerate European interest in AI startups, drawing more attention and potentially more capital into the region.

It reinforces the idea that global capital flows are not limited by geography and that talent mobility, not territory, increasingly defines the AI race. European AI talent has been moving among global hubs, and deals like this underline how strongly competitive pressures are shaping that movement.

At the same time, the concentration of huge capital in a few dominant players raises strategic questions for European policymakers and investors. If global valuations continue to centralise power and resources in U.S. and Asia-based AI giants, Europe’s AI initiatives may struggle to build regional champions with equivalent scale.

Efforts to foster AI ecosystems, from regulatory clarity to public funding mechanisms, will be tested in the face of such capital dynamics.

Sequoia’s bet on Anthropic, despite its exposure to rivals, underscores a fundamental truth about where the AI race is headed: talent and execution matter more than regional advantage.

For European startups, this means honing in on distinctive technical niches, enterprise traction, and real-world impact rather than simply following headline valuations.

The Anthropic round may be a moment of spectacle, but its lasting impact will be measured in how ecosystems evolve, how talent flows, and how global competition shapes opportunities for innovation across borders. European players can benefit from these trends, but only if they leverage their own strengths in research, ethics-led deployment, and deep industry partnerships.

In the end, this deal isn’t just about money; it’s a signal of where confidence lies in the next chapter of AI, and who stands to gain as a result.

            <h2>Europe’s €307 million AI funding call</h2>
            <p><strong>The Next Web | 2026-01-19</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://thenextweb.com/news/europes-e307-million-ai-funding-call">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">When the European Commission announced on 15th of January a €307.3 million funding call for AI and related tech under Horizon Europe earlier this year, the press materials presented it as a strategic push toward trustworthy AI and European digital autonomy. The funding targets trustworthy AI, data services, robotics, quantum, photonics, and what Brussels calls “open strategic autonomy.”

Viewed in isolation, the number itself isn’t eye-popping. By global standards, where the private sector alone pours hundreds of billions into AI, €307 million is barely a rounding error. Yet this sum matters less for its scale and more for what it reveals about Europe’s longstanding dilemma: how to balance ambitious tech leadership with a cautious, value-driven regulatory culture.

What the EU has done here is consistent with a long-running pattern. Brussels has been building an AI ecosystem that explicitly prioritises ethics, safety , and strategic autonomy over raw capability. The “Apply AI Strategy,” which this funding supports, is designed to ensure AI systems are trustworthy and aligned with European values.

This contrasts sharply with the Silicon Valley model, where scale, speed , and commercial dominance often trump wider social aims.
There’s value in that distinction. Too much focus on growth alone can produce outcomes that benefit a few platforms while leaving society to manage the fallout from algorithmic bias , misinformation , and opaque decision-making systems.

Europe’s regulatory framework, including the Artificial Intelligence Act, embeds risk-based guardrails that aim to prevent harm without halting innovation entirely.

But here’s the rub: principle without productivity can feel like good intentions in a vacuum.

Three years into the AI revolution, the EU’s cumulative investments from this €307 million pool to broader programs under Horizon Europe reflect ambition on paper. But across hard metrics like proprietary model development, commercial AI exports, and infrastructure scale, Europe still lags the US and China. In 2025, reports noted Europe produced far fewer notable AI models than its global competitors, a symptom of a deeper ecosystem gap.

Investing in trustworthy AI is laudable; it’s also inherently longer-term, often without the immediate returns that lure commercial capital. By contrast, the US innovation model embraces iterative risk and market experimentation, which helps explain its dominance in foundational model research and deployment.

Here, Europe’s regulatory heft of the AI Act and related oversight mechanisms both help and hinder. Responsible frameworks can build trust and alignment with public values, but if they become too cumbersome, they risk slowing the very innovation they are meant to guide. Bosch’s leadership in Europe has cautioned against “regulating itself to death,” arguing that excessive bureaucracy deters research and deployment.

The €307 million funding explicitly aims to strengthen strategic autonomy and the ability of European innovators to develop AI technologies without dependency on external tech giants.

That’s a worthy goal. Yet autonomy is easier to declare than to realise. Achieving it requires not just funding research but building scale, infrastructure, talent, and market pull simultaneously. Europe’s efforts on AI gigafactories and high-performance computing centres signal long-term intent, but critics still see fragmentation in infrastructure and business support.
In other words, strategic autonomy without substantial ecosystem maturity can feel like sovereignty in theory, not practice.

The question isn’t whether Europe should fund AI research. The question is whether Europe can translate normative leadership into technological leadership.

If the goal is to lead in ethical, human-centric AI that serves public interest first, then this funding fits a broader philosophy. If the goal is to rival the scale and velocity of global tech powers, then incremental investments like this, however well-intentioned, are positions in a longer, incomplete race.

The EU’s approach to AI will succeed only if it pairs principled regulation with bold bets on infrastructure, startups and commercial pathways that scale quickly. That won’t happen through selective research grants alone.

Europe can still carve a distinctive niche in global AI. Its regulatory clarity, public-interest focus and collaborative innovation structures give it moral authority and, over time, competitive strength if it can channel them into meaningful technological outcomes.

For now, the €307 million is a marker on a long road, not a finish line. It signals where Brussels stands: committed to values, cautious by design, and eager to shape the trajectory of AI, even if it’s not yet setting the pace.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">OpenAI’s decision to introduce advertisements inside ChatGPT for free users and its new $8 “Go” tier is already shaping up to be one of the most consequential pivots in generative AI’s short history. It’s not a simple business tweak. It’s a reframing of where digital intent, attention, and commercial influence intersect in an age where conversations increasingly replace search bars.

Yet, this moment will be remembered not as the day ads arrived in ChatGPT, but as the day two decades of assumptions about search and digital advertising broke open.

Read that again: ads won’t sit beside or above a list of links, as they do on Google. They will appear inside the conversational flow, at the moment a user has just received a helpful answer.

This is not incremental. It’s a new interface for intent.

The latest rumblings from the EU tech scene, a story from our wise ol&#39; founder Boris, and some questionable AI art. It&#39;s free, every week, in your inbox. Sign up now!

For years, OpenAI developed ChatGPT as an ad-free oasis in a web saturated with promotions, pop-ups, and sponsored results. Now it’s embracing the oldest monetization strategy on the internet: advertising.  The company insists ads will be clearly labeled, won’t influence AI responses, and won’t depend on selling individual user data. Ads will appear below answers when relevant, and paid tiers like Plus, Pro, Business, and Enterprise remain ad-free.

To understand why this matters, you need to see it not as an ad insertion, but as a shift in how commerce enters human intent, at the moment of decision, not distraction.

In a classic Google search, thoughtful queries turn into ranked links and ad slots beside them. In a ChatGPT conversation, a user asks a question, gets an answer, and stays in context; the frame never changes. An ad beneath that response isn’t an interruption; it’s an extension of the thought process. This subtle repositioning changes how brands can engage a user: they’re not chasing clicks after a search, they’re walking up with the answer itself.

That’s a paradigm shift. Brands are no longer competing for top billing on a results page; they are competing to be part of the narrative that unfolds between a question and a resolution. It’s a level of semantic proximity to intent that search ads never capture, because even the best keywords are guesses at nuance. ChatGPT sees nuance first.

Let restaurants, retailers, and SaaS companies imagine that: not just showing an ad after someone searches “best CRM tools,” but appearing contextually right when someone asks “what CRM features matter to small teams.” That changes where conversion flows start.

This isn’t happening. OpenAI’s infrastructure costs are enormous, and its free user base dwarfs its subscriber base. Only a small fraction of ChatGPT’s hundreds of millions of weekly active users currently pay. Advertising offers a scalable revenue path that could subsidize free access and help the company balance long-term costs.

It’s striking that OpenAI once positioned ads as a “last resort.” Now they’re a strategic mainstay. That tells you two things: the scale of AI compute bills is real, and the company is trying to find a sustainable business model that doesn’t rely solely on subscription fatigue.

ChatGPT’s value isn’t just utility; it’s credibility, the feeling that the answer isn’t trying to sell you something. Introducing ads atop or below answers may be technically neutral, but perception is sticky. Once a user notices “Sponsored” within the thoughtful flow of a conversation, trust becomes negotiable. Academic research on ads in AI interfaces shows that even labeled ads can reduce perceived trust and make users feel manipulated, especially if they blur with responses.

OpenAI recognizes this. It’s promising to avoid showing ads in sensitive contexts, like health, politics, or personal advice, and won’t target minors. It’s also pledging that ads won’t twist the model’s answers.

Yet trust isn’t a function of code; it’s a feeling users develop over time. One poorly placed ad recommendation, even if accurate, can make people wonder whether the answer was shaped by commercial rather than objective logic.

From a creative standpoint, this is both exciting and fraught. The ads we’ve long tolerated have trained us to think of marketing as interruption: banners, pop-ups, pre-roll videos. ChatGPT’s approach suggests something closer to contextual dialogue, where an ad feels like a part of exploration. The brands that succeed here won’t be the loudest; they’ll be the most relevant, most resonant, and most human. They’ll read like answers, not impositions, because they’re embedded in answers.

That opens a new creative demand: marketers will need to think less about clickbait hooks and more about narrative relevance, how to be helpful within a user’s question, not beside it.

Is this the end of Google? No. Google’s advertising machine is vast, integrated, and highly optimized. Its AI integration in search, including AI summaries, already blends insight with ads in ways that are more sophisticated than many realize.

But the rise of ads in ChatGPT signals that intent has multiple layers now. There’s traditional search intent tied to links and pages, and there’s conversational intent captured in natural language interactions. These layers will coexist, sometimes reinforce, sometimes compete.

Advertisers and creators today often optimize for keywords. Tomorrow, they’ll optimize for conversational moments, the semantic cues that signal purchase interest within a dialogue.

The rollout now is just the beginning. If AI systems evolve into multi-modal, interactive assistants that help people plan trips, make purchases, write essays, plan budgets, and solve problems of every sort, the point at which commerce enters that interaction becomes crucial.

The question is no longer “Will people see our ad?” but “Will they trust our recommendation when it pops up next to an AI answer?”

That’s the real test, and the real frontier.

            <h2>BizzyNow opens Mamacrowd equity round to fund “micro-meetings” for business professionals</h2>

            <a class="original-link" href="https://thenextweb.com/news/bizzynow-opens-mamacrowd-equity-round">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Italian startup BizzyNow has launched an equity crowdfunding round on Mamacrowd to finance the next phase of its networking app, built around quick, in-person meetups it calls “Bizzy Moments.” The campaign targets €150k–€400k at a €3m pre-money valuation, with a €500 minimum ticket. BizzyNow says proceeds will support go-to-market validation, product upgrades, and the operational groundwork needed to scale.

Professional networking has a timing problem. The most valuable introductions often happen in the gaps: 40 minutes before a flight, a pause between conference sessions, an unscheduled evening in a new city, or the lull after a client meeting. But the tools professionals typically use to connect are optimized for asynchronous, low-context interactions (requests, messages, posts) rather than real-time, location-based intent.

BizzyNow’s premise is simple: when two relevant people are already in the same place, and both have time, “discovering each other” should not require long threads, calendar gymnastics, or cold outreach. The company positions its product as a way to turn downtime during business travel and events into structured, high-signal conversations.

“BizzyNow is built for the moments when professionals are already in the same place, with time to meet, but no practical way to discover each other quickly. We’re giving people a way to use that moment to show their best side, and turn idle business travel time into measurable B2B outcomes”, said the CEO, Tommaso Fe.

BizzyNow is designed to turn “I have 45 minutes” into a practical meeting. The app uses geolocation plus an AI layer and LinkedIn integration to surface nearby professionals who may be relevant, then encourages short, structured meetups lasting roughly 30 to 90 minutes. BizzyNow describes these as micro-meetings held in neutral, community-recommended locations, intended to move beyond chatting into a realconversation. BizzyNow also describes a trust-oriented scoring approach that is meant to reflect the value creates through meetings, emphasizing quality and follow-through rather than connection
volume.

BizzyNow is pitching into a familiar contradiction: professionals are back at conferences, airports, hotels, and coworking spaces, but introductions still default to slow, noisy digital channels. In-person events have regained their role as dealflow engines. Yet discovery remains fragmented across LinkedIn messages, WhatsApp groups, and chance encounters, with little infrastructure for “right person, right place, right time.” BizzyNow is betting that instant, location-aware matching can become a practical layer for high-intent environments, especially where timing is the constraint.

The company’s target segments reflect that focus. In campaign materials, BizzyNow points to business travelers, managers, freelancers, expats, event communities, corporate HR, coworking spaces, hotels, and airports as core audiences and partners.

The raise is being run via Mamacrowd, one of Italy’s established equity crowdfunding platforms, and the campaign is live.

On the Mamacrowd listing, the round is set with:

For early-stage startups, equity crowdfunding can be more than financing. It can act as a public proof point for market interest, build a base of aligned advocates, and strengthen credibility with commercial partners, especially for products that grow through communities.

BizzyNow’s internal materials describe traction that is still early but measurable, including ca. 2,000 free users, 400 weekly active users (22.6% WAU-to-total), and six active corporate pilots. The same documents state that the company is in pre-revenue, with monetization intentionally deferred during the validation phase. That context matters: this is a campaign funding a transition from adoption validation to monetization proof, not a late-stage expansion round.

“Crowdfunding fits our model because community is not a byproduct for us. It’s part of how we validate activation, refine the product, and build repeatable go-to-market channels before scaling”, said the CEO, Tommaso Fe.

BizzyNow’s pitch deck frames its roadmap as a progression “from validation to global market,” staged across three years:

● 2025: MVP, beta launch, early validation
● 2026: Premium launch, B2B pilots, monetization validation
● 2027: EMEA expansion and scale readiness

That sequencing aligns with what BizzyNow describes in its internal underwriting materials: corporate pilots are active, monetization is modeled to begin mid-2026, and the near-term priority is proving repeatable activation and conversion mechanics.

On use of funds, the Executive Pitch Deck states the round is intended to validate monetization, strengthen product capabilities, and prepare for scale, with spend tied to measurable validation milestones across:

● Marketing & GTM validation
● Product and premium features
● Compliance and governance
● Team and operations

The Mamacrowd campaign further breaks planned allocation into ranges:

● 40%–50% Marketing and Brand Activation
● 20%–25% Technology Development (BizzyNow app)
● 10% Legal and Compliance
● 10%–15% Team and Operations● 10% Strategic reserve

BizzyNow also outlines a B2B-oriented monetization path in its deck and model assumptions, including paid event activations, company-wide licensing, and data/analytics packages, while explicitly noting that projections remain validation-stage assumptions and will be refined as unit economics are proven.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">In January 2026, London’s mayor gave a blunt warning that has reverberated far beyond City Hall: artificial intelligence could trigger “mass unemployment” in the capital’s core industries unless policymakers act now.

His words came with an unexpected counterweight: an announcement of free AI training and a dedicated task force to help workers adapt. This juxtaposition captures a tension shaping Europe’s labour landscape: fear and opportunity locked in the same story.

The anxiety isn’t limited to one city. Across the continent, debates about AI’s impact on jobs are intensifying. Visionaries and critics paint dramatically different pictures. Some technologists warn that advanced AI could substitute human labour at an unprecedented pace.

Others argue these fears are exaggerated or misplaced if governments and employers can guide the transition. For many Europeans, the question is no longer theoretical; it is unfolding before their eyes.

At first look, the job market’s headline figures tell a reassuring story: overall unemployment across the European Union remains low, with EU unemployment at about 5.8% in 2025, down from 6.0% a year earlier. Youth unemployment has also declined in many countries, indicating that even entry-level opportunities persist for most workers.

In some sectors where AI tools are already in use, work has been reshaped rather than eliminated. A European study found that 30% of EU workers now use AI at work, especially for text tasks like writing and translation, and that digital tools have become nearly universal (90%) across workplaces.

Many workers report that AI helps them perform tasks more efficiently or take on different responsibilities. At the same time, employers are actively reassessing job roles because of AI, with about 71% of European firms reconsidering job responsibilities due to AI implementation and over a quarter reducing hiring or cutting roles as a direct result of AI deployment.

Beneath these numbers lie subtler shifts. Firms across the EU are becoming cautious about hiring, in part because of economic slowdowns and in part because AI adoption is changing how work gets done. Economic indicators suggest employment growth across the EU will slow in the coming years, with fewer vacancies and reduced labour market dynamism even as AI use spreads.

The most visible tension is at the intersection of perception and preparation. On the one hand, public statements like London’s mayors reflect a palpable fear of displacement. Sectors such as finance, legal services, and customer support, pillars of many European economies,  are widely considered vulnerable to automation and generative AI technologies.

Detailed labour data suggest that many jobs are being reshaped at the task level, even if entire job categories are not yet disappearing wholesale. For example, AI is automating routine text production and data tasks while increasingly augmenting analytical and oversight functions.

On the other hand, there are signs of adaptability. Governments and institutions are launching initiatives to reskill workers and embed AI fluency into professional development. Across Europe, digital skills gaps remain significant; only 56% of adults aged 16-74 had basic digital skills in 2023, well below the EU’s target, indicating the scale of upskilling needed.

Educational efforts range from vocational programs to industry partnerships that teach AI-related skills. For example, private training providers across the EU are expanding online programs in data science, analytics, and AI competencies, reflecting a growing recognition that skills matter as much as technology itself.

It would be a mistake to frame this moment as simply a binary between jobs lost and jobs saved. The World Economic Forum’s Future of Jobs Report 2025 predicts both creation and disruption, with employers foreseeing demand for entirely new roles even as others change or shrink.

The report finds that technologies, including AI, are expected to create millions of new jobs globally while displacing an estimated number of others, highlighting the scale of transformation.

There is also a policy dimension that can’t be overlooked. European institutions are experimenting with social safety nets and active labour market policies that aim to cushion displacement and support transitions.

Proposals like a European AI Social Compact argue for strategies that combine employment support, training, and social protections as central to economic planning.

National governments are debating everything from expanded unemployment support tied to training to tax incentives for companies that invest in human capital alongside AI. These measures acknowledge that the future of work is not simply about machines replacing people, but about how people and machines can be integrated into resilient labour ecosystems.

Yet challenges remain. Entry-level opportunities, the traditional gateway for recent graduates, are tightening in many sectors as employers increasingly use automated systems in recruitment and candidate screening.

Surveys suggest broad concern among young job seekers about prospects in an AI-transformed market, even where overall employment remains stable.

Some employers are re-imagining entry paths by embedding AI training into internship programs, while others are partnering with universities to co-design curricula that emphasize AI-augmented work. These efforts signal that adaptation is possible, but they also highlight how uneven the transition has been so far.

What Europe faces now is not a single story of mass job losses or unrestrained job growth. It is a mosaic of experiences, where headlines of risk and reports of adaptation coexist. The labour market is not static; it is reacting to technology, to policy, to fear and hope in equal measure.

If there is a throughline, it’s this: Europe’s future of work will be shaped not just by the capabilities of artificial intelligence, but by choices about education, regulation, and social support.

The decisions policymakers and employers make today will tilt the balance between disruption and opportunity. In that sense, the conversation is less about whether AI will change jobs; it already is, and more about how Europe navigates the change.

That is the reality workers, firms, and governments must confront together.

This reminds me of the well-known anecdote in Romanian political history in which Ion I.C. (Ionel) Brătianu, asked by historian and politician Nicolae Iorga what a scholar could learn from an engineer, replied with just that phrase, a call for moderation and thoughtful judgment: “Measure, sir, measure!”

Thus, measure, thoughtful regulation, and worker-focused policy will make sure AI supports people’s work, protects rights, and steers technological change toward shared opportunity, not making them unemployed.
