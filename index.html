            <h2>How Europe’s new carbon tax on imported goods will change global trade</h2>
            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2025-12-20</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/12/how-europes-new-carbon-tax-on-imported-goods-will-change-global-trade/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">For people living in the European Union, the price of their next car, home renovation, and even local produce may soon reflect a climate policy that many have never even heard of. This new regulation, which comes fully into force on New Year’s Day, does not just target heavy industry—it affects everyday goods which now face an added carbon cost when they enter Europe.

The carbon border adjustment mechanism (CBAM) puts a carbon price on many imported goods—meaning that EU-based importers will pay for the greenhouse gases emitted during the production of certain carbon-intensive materials.

If goods come from countries with weaker climate rules, then the charge will be higher. To sell to the EU, producers will effectively need to show their goods aren’t too carbon-intensive.

The goal is to prevent companies from relocating their production to places with looser regulations, ensuring fair competition between EU and non-EU companies, while incentivising global decarbonisation.

After a trial phase, full payment obligations begin on January 1 2026, when importers will need to buy CBAM certificates to cover the embedded emissions in goods such as iron and steel, aluminium, cement, fertilisers, hydrogen and (eventually) electricity.

Although it is an EU climate policy, CBAM looks set to be a game-changer for global trade. Countries that rely on EU exports may need to make costly investments in cleaner technologies and better emissions tracking, or risk losing market share. The UK government plans to introduce its own version of CBAM in 2027—although how this links to the EU’s is yet to be decided.

A positive shift is already underway: more and more companies are now measuring and reporting their emissions accurately, responding to the growing demand for reliable carbon data. At the same time, an increasing number of countries are introducing their own carbon pricing systems to stay aligned with the EU and protect the competitiveness of their exports.

Morocco is a prominent example: its 2025 finance law gradually introduces a carbon tax from January 2026. As Moroccan firms will already pay a carbon price domestically, their exports are likely to avoid additional CBAM charges at the EU border, helping them remain competitive.

In many countries, CBAM is also accelerating interest in renewable energy and greener industrial processes. Some see it not as a threat, but an opportunity to attract investment and position themselves as low-carbon manufacturing hubs.

However, this mechanism is still controversial. For businesses, CBAM is complex and administratively heavy. Firms need robust systems to measure embedded emissions, collect data from suppliers, and produce environmental product declarations. Many will also need new renewable energy contracts to cut their carbon footprint.

Around the world, CBAM has faced strong criticism. India and China describe it as “green protectionism,” arguing that it puts unfair pressure on developing economies. At the same time, the EU has not yet created dedicated funding to help exporters in lower-income countries adapt. Without this support, the mechanism may not achieve the desired results.

Although CBAM is mainly aimed at industry, its ripple effects will reach consumers in the EU. Importers are unlikely to absorb the full additional cost, meaning prices are likely to rise—particularly for goods that rely heavily on steel, aluminium, or cement. This could mean Europe sees higher costs for cars, home appliances, electronics, building materials, and, indirectly, food production (through fertilizers).

At the same time, CBAM may bring more transparency. Because importers must report the emissions embedded in their goods, consumers may eventually have clearer information about the climate impact of what they buy.

The mechanism will also generate EU revenues from certificate sales. These are expected to support vulnerable households in many European countries, as well as funding clean technologies and improving energy efficiency. How the funds are used will be crucial to public acceptance of Europe’s new carbon tax.

Even before full implementation, CBAM is already reshaping supply chains and influencing government policies far beyond Europe’s borders. It may trigger trade disputes, push exporters to adopt carbon pricing, and highlight the need for more climate finance to support developing countries undergoing green industrial transitions.

For many European consumers, it’s likely to mean gradual price increases—and potentially, more climate-conscious purchasing decisions. Behind the scenes, it marks a significant shift in how global trade accounts for carbon—and how climate policy reaches into people’s everyday lives.

            <h2>Google lobs lawsuit at search result scraping firm SerpApi</h2>

            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/google/2025/12/google-lobs-lawsuit-at-search-result-scraping-firm-serpapi/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Google has filed a lawsuit to protect its search results, targeting a firm called SerpApi that has turned Google’s 10 blue links into a business. According to Google, SerpApi ignores established law and Google’s terms to scrape and resell its search engine results pages (SERPs). This is not the first action against SerpApi, but Google’s decision to go after a scraper could signal a new, more aggressive stance on protecting its search data.

SerpApi and similar firms do fulfill a need, but they sit in a legal gray area. Google does not provide an API for its search results, which are based on the world’s largest and most comprehensive web index. That makes Google’s SERPs especially valuable in the age of AI. A chatbot can’t summarize web links if it can’t find them, which has led companies like Perplexity to pay for SerpApi’s second-hand Google data. That prompted Reddit to file a lawsuit against SerpApi and Perplexity for grabbing its data from Google results.

Google is echoing many of the things Reddit said when it publicized its lawsuit earlier this year. The search giant claims it’s not just doing this to protect itself—it’s also about protecting the websites it indexes. In Google’s blog post on the legal action, it says SerpApi “violates the choices of websites and rightsholders about who should have access to their content.”

It’s worth noting that Google has a partnership with Reddit that pipes data directly into Gemini. As a result, you’ll often see Reddit pages cited in the chatbot’s outputs. As Google points out, it abides by “industry-standard crawling protocols” to collect the data that appears on its SERPs, but those sites didn’t agree to let SerpApi scrape their data from Google. So while you could reasonably argue that Google’s lawsuit helps protect the rights of web publishers, it also explicitly protects Google’s business interests.

The kind of data scraping that SerpApi uses is not new—Google has simply put up with it until now. However, the company claims that SerpApi’s deceptive behavior, like spoofing user agents and hammering sites with armies of bots, has increased significantly over the past year. That may have something to do with the ever-growing hunger for search data in the AI era.

Google is coming out of its antitrust cases relatively unscathed so far, which affects the availability of its data. It has avoided the harshest remedies, like the government’s demand that Google offer search data to competitors. That might have turned businesses like SerpApi legit, but with that no longer an option, Google may feel emboldened to unleash the lawyers.

While Google paints this as a benevolent action, it stands to benefit by stopping SERP scrapers. However, this may make some of Google’s competitors happy, too. Since the search giant doesn’t offer an official API for search (and the courts declined to force the issue), SERP scraping provides a way for companies to get Google’s search data on the down-low. This reduces demand for the handful of other web indexes that do have APIs, including Brave and Bing. Without illicit search APIs, chatbots may have to lean on official data sources.</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The trade-off between quality and quantity is a fundamental economic dilemma. Now, a team of British, American, and Japanese researchers describes how it applies to biology, as well. They have discovered that this dilemma most likely shaped the evolutionary trajectory of ants, one of Earth’s most successful groups of organisms.

Their study reveals that, as ant societies grew in complexity and numbers, they didn’t just make their workers smaller—they also made them cheaper.

In the insect world, the exoskeleton known as the cuticle serves as a protective barrier against predators, pathogens, and desiccation, while providing the structural framework for muscle attachment. But this protection comes at a price. Building a robust cuticle requires significant amounts of nitrogen and rare minerals like zinc and manganese. While skimping on armor for an individual insect may be a death sentence, the evolution of ants apparently found a way around it.

“There’s this question in biology of what happens to individuals as societies they are in get more complex?” said Evan Economo, an entomologist at the University of Maryland and co-author of the study. “For example, the individuals may themselves become simpler because tasks that a solitary organism would need to complete can be handled by a collective.”

Economo’s team hypothesized that the metabolic balance behind investing in cuticles in social insects like ants could favor the collective over the individual. The idea was that a colony of 10,000 workers could lose a few individuals to a predator without much consequence, so investing heavily in each worker’s defenses would seem like a waste of precious nutrients. To test this hypothesis, they examined whether ant lineages that maintain massive, specialized workforces reduce the investment in their individual workers’ exoskeletons.

To test this idea, the researchers needed to pull off a comparative study on the anatomy of ants at an unprecedented scale. “We worked with scans of ant specimens and species from all over the world to capture the global diversity of ants,” Economo says. The team used a massive database called Antscan, which contains three-dimensional X-ray microtomography imaging of ants from around the globe.

Microtomography works similarly to medical CT scans, but at a vastly higher resolution. Still, on its own, the technique could only generate lots of precise data—it still had to be interpreted. Parsing through 3D imagery of over 880 specimens, including workers, queens, and males belonging to over 500 different species, was another challenge. “The 3D scanning itself is a very advanced technology,” says Arthur Matte, a researcher at the University of Cambridge and lead author of the study. “But once you have the ants in three dimensions, it’s still very hard to segment manually every tissue you’re interested in.”

To solve this, Matte developed a computer vision algorithm for “unsupervised segmentation.” Because the cuticle is always the outermost tissue of an arthropod, the algorithm could automatically identify and measure the volume of the exoskeleton across all ants in the dataset.

The first thing scientists noticed when the results poured in was that cuticle investment varied wildly, ranging from 6 percent to 35 percent of an ant’s total body volume. So, the next thing they focused on was figuring out the reasons behind these variations.

The team started checking how factors like diet, temperature, humidity, and foraging style correlated with the size of the cuticle. To get a handle on this, segmented 3D scans were fed into evolutionary models. “One of the most insightful things we did was to individually remove such variables from the models to estimate their contributions to the final cuticle investment,” Matte explains. This way, scientists learned that temperature was responsible for just 12 percent of variation in cuticle size and diet—especially its nitrogen content—explained another 37 percent. But the factor that had the strongest impact on the model was the colony size.

Ants that invested less in their cuticle tended to have significantly larger colony sizes. More surprisingly, this reduction in cuticle investment and the resulting increase in colony size appeared to be associated with higher diversification rates. In biological terms, squishier ants could evolve to occupy new niches much faster than their heavily armored cousins. “Requiring less nitrogen could make these ants more versatile and able to conquer new environments,” Matte suggests. This efficiency may have allowed ants to transition from a diet of high-protein prey to more abundant but less nutritious liquid sugar sources, like honeydew or floral nectar.

“Ants reduce per-worker investment in one of the most nutritionally expensive tissues for the good of the collective,” Matte explains. “They’re shifting from self-investment toward a distributed workforce.”

The researchers think the pattern they observed in ants reflects a more universal trend in the evolution of societal complexity. The transition from solitary life to complex societies echoes the transition from single-celled organisms to multicellular ones.

In a single-celled organism, a cell must be a “jack-of-all-trades,” performing every function necessary for survival. In a multicellular animal, however, individual cells often become simpler and more specialized, relying on the collective for protection and resources.

“It’s a pattern that echoes the evolution of multicellularity, where cooperative units can be individually simpler than a solitary cell, yet collectively capable of far greater complexity,” says Matte. Still, the question of whether underinvesting in individuals to boost the collective makes sense for creatures other than ants remains open, and it most likely isn’t as much about nutritional economics as it is about sex.

The study focused on ants that already have a reproductive division of labor, one where workers do not reproduce. This social structure is likely the key prerequisite for the cheap worker strategy. For the team, this is the reason we haven’t, at least so far, found similar evolutionary patterns in more complex social organisms like wolves, which live in packs—or humans with their amazingly complex societies. Wolves and people are both social, but maintain a high degree of individual self-interest regarding reproduction. Ant workers could be made expendable because they don’t pass their own genes—they are essentially extensions of the queen’s reproductive strategy.

Before looking for signs of ant-like approaches to quality versus quantity dilemmas in other species, the team wants to take an even closer look at ants. Economo, Matte, and their colleagues seek to expand their analysis to other ant tissues, such as the nervous system and muscles, to see if the cheapening of individuals extends beyond the exoskeleton. They are also looking at ant genomes to see what genetic innovations allowed for the shift from quality to quantity.  “We still need a lot of work to understand ants’ evolution,” Matte says.

            <div id="article-text">Mysterious interstellar object 3I/ATLAS made its closest approach to Earth on December 19, coming within just 167 million miles.

Scientists have been closely monitoring the object — which is largely believed to be a natural comet and only the third of its kind to have been directly observed in the solar system — as it continued on its highly eccentric trajectory.

The encounter with Earth, however, turned out to be a bit of an anticlimax, as Harvard astronomer Avi Loeb, who has long championed the far-fetched theory that the object may be an alien spacecraft, lamented in a blog post titled “3I/ATLAS Ignores Earth.” Instead of doing something you might expect of aliens during their closest approach to Earth, it simply cruised on by.

While hopes that we were just visited by an alien race diminish even further, Loeb made an interesting pivot in a follow-up piece, proposing that other objects like 3I/ATLAS could be useful for our future attempts to explore beyond our solar system.

“The Voyager Golden Records, containing a time capsule of sounds, images, music, and messages from Earth, were attached to NASA’s Voyager 1 and 2 spacecraft, which are currently traveling out of the solar system,” he wrote. “These records serve as humanity’s message for any intelligent extraterrestrial life that might find them, essentially a ‘message in a bottle’ sent out to interstellar space.”

Thanks to their tremendous speeds, exotic visitors like the latest interstellar object could carry a human spacecraft out of the solar system on our behalf, Loeb argued.

By “riding 3I/ATLAS,” which is traveling at a speed of 37 miles a second, he argued that we could reach “interstellar space by the year ~10,000 CE instead of the year ~30,000 CE.”

Even though they launched almost half a century ago, Voyager 1 and Voyager 2 only recently reached the boundary of the heliosphere. To enter true interstellar space beyond the Oort Cloud, where objects are no longer bound to the gravitational effects of the Sun, it could take Voyager 1 another 28,000 years.

“The discovery of interstellar objects over the past decade offers new opportunities for humanity to send time capsules to interstellar space,” he concluded.

To attach the message to objects like 3I/ATLAS, Loeb proposed using a “high-power laser beam to engrave a message” or “design interceptor missions” to attach technological objects to their surface.

For its part, 3I/ATLAS is expected to get within just 33.3 million miles of Jupiter on March 16, 2026, offering us yet another opportunity to have a closer look using spacecraft positioned there.

Nobody knows when we’ll be able to observe the next interstellar object careening through our neck of the cosmic woods. But according to Loeb, we should seize the opportunity.

To “gain respect near the top of the food chain in the Milky Way galaxy,” Loeb argued that we must take matters into our own hands, and “endeavor to interstellar space.”

Loeb himself says he’d even jump to commit his own body to such a project.

He “would have loved to hitchhike 3I/ATLAS and let it carry my remains into interstellar space,” he wrote, “if offered the opportunity.”

            <h2>Waymos Cause Traffic Jams Across City During Power Outage</h2>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Neither snow nor rain nor heat nor gloom of night will stay these robotaxis of their appointed trips — but a power outage apparently will.

On Saturday evening, a blackout left nearly a third of San Francisco in the dark. But its most visible casualties were Waymo robocabs, which were left stranded on the city streets like large toys inconveniently discarded by a child.

Footage shared online shows numerous Waymos stalled in the middle of busy roads, blocking human motorists. Often, the self-driving cabs were gaggled together, serving to unintentionally cordon off city blocks, their emergency lights blinking in unison. In one video, at least five Waymo robotaxis can be seen piled up in the same intersection. It appeared that without traffic lights to guide them, the highly advanced cars were utterly rudderless.

“Somebody’s gonna set this thing on fire if it doesn’t move soon,” a pedestrian observed, as motorists honked their horns in vain at a frozen Waymo.

In short, it was a PR disaster. With its cabs going on strike of their own accord, Waymo simply made it official and suspended ride-hailing services that evening following the power outage. It’s now resumed rides as of Sunday afternoon.

“Yesterday’s power outage was a widespread event that caused gridlock across San Francisco, with non-functioning traffic signals and transit disruptions,” a Waymo spokesperson said in a statement, via CNBC. “While the failure of the utility infrastructure was significant, we are committed to ensuring our technology adjusts to traffic flow during such events.”

It was an edge case to be sure, but the episode will put a dent in Waymo’s image, and perhaps robotaxis at large. Though Waymo reports a stellar safety record, the cabs remain controversial with locals due to the disruptions they cause, a sentiment that has reached a boiling point over incidents such as when a Waymo struck and killed a beloved San Francisco bodega cat.

It’s fair to criticize the company for seemingly not having a contingency plan in place for an event like a power outage. Tesla CEO Elon Musk, whose self-driving cars have been involved in their fair share of blunders as well as deadly accidents, was quick to make this point by gloating about his own autonomous fleet.

“Tesla Robotaxis were unaffected by the SF power outage,” he tweeted.

We don’t know if Musk’s claim is actually true, but it shows that the Tesla-Waymo rivalry is still in full-swing, even if Musk’s automaker remains a distant second. Musk has used Waymo accidents and blunders to needle the company in the past, and has shown he wasn’t above some literal dick-measuring.

Still, this is far from the first time Waymos have disrupted traffic. The robotaxis have shown that they can be overwhelmed by events that fall outside their programming, like a parade or a police standoff. These aren’t easy things to account for — but you might demand better from a company that already has thousands of autonomous cabs operating across the country.

            <h2>Sam Altman Unhappy With Fate He’s Created for Himself</h2>
            <p><strong>Futurism | 2025-12-22</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://futurism.com/artificial-intelligence/sam-altman-unhappy-public-company-ceo">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Several major companies — including Elon Musk’s SpaceX, Sam Altman’s OpenAI, and competitor Anthropic — are eyeing enormous stock market debuts as soon as next year, all vying to attain an astronomical valuation north of $100 billion.

In late October, OpenAI was rumored to be laying the groundwork for a mammoth IPO that would boost its value to $1 trillion, further raising the stakes as the AI industry is starting to struggle to convince investors of the tech’s long-term value.

The mercurial Altman, though, is playing it all down. In a Thursday episode of tech journalist Alex Kantrowitz’s “Big Technology Podcast,” the billionaire didn’t even attempt to feign excitement over the prospect of far more scrutiny and regulatory oversight as an openly traded company.

“Am I excited to be a public company CEO?” he said. “Zero percent.”

“Am I excited for OpenAI to be a public company?” he added. “In some ways, I am, and in some ways I think it’d be really annoying.”

At the same time, the CEO stopped far short of revealing plans for a 2026 IPO.

“I don’t know,” he said cryptically. “We will be very late to go public.”

His comments, however, highlight lingering questions over the AI industry. Experts have long warned of an AI bubble that could be set to burst — potentially even taking down the rest of the economy with it.

Even as a privately-run company, OpenAI has already been under plenty of scrutiny, especially as competition continues to encroach on its early lead. Altman even recently declared a “code red” in a memo to employees, urging them to double down on improving ChatGPT at the cost of delaying other projects.

And according to the CEO, it certainly won’t be the last time, either.

“I think that it’s good to be paranoid and act quickly when a potential competitive threat emerges,” Altman told Kantrowitz. “My guess is we’ll be doing these once maybe twice a year for a long time, and that’s part of really just making sure that we win in our space.”

“I think Google is still a huge threat, you know,” Altman admitted. “Extremely powerful company.”

We can only speculate how markets will react when OpenAI goes public. But considering the sheer amount of pressure that’s on the company, it’s no wonder Altman is unhappy with the fate he has created for himself.

All eyes are already on the firm as the AI industry continues to shift and make wild swings as it attempts to justify its sky-high buzz — and going public will only crank up the pressure.

            <p><strong>TechCrunch | 2025-12-22</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/22/paramount-renews-bid-for-warner-bros-ensuring-40-billion-larry-ellison-backing/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The war for the future of Warner Brothers continues, as Paramount Skydance announced Monday an amended all-cash offer for the legacy movie studio. The offer includes an “irrevocable personal guarantee” from a major backer, Oracle billionaire Larry Ellison, to provide tens of billions in equity financing for the deal. It’s the latest move by Ellison’s son, David Ellison—the CEO of Paramount Skydance—to pry the potential acquisition loose from his competition, the streaming giant Netflix.

“Larry Ellison has agreed to provide an irrevocable personal guarantee of $40.4 billion of the equity financing for the offer and any damages claims against Paramount,” a Paramount press release published Monday states. The proposed equity financing had previously been included in Paramount’s offer, but the elder Ellison’s “personal guarantee” is new, the press release states.

The revamped offer comes a mere week after the WBD board rejected Paramount’s initial bid, favoring, instead, a previous deal with Netflix. That deal was announced on December 5th, outlining how the streamer would purchase the movie studio via a cash and stock option valued at $27.75 per WBD share, and a total enterprise value of $82.7 billion.

Three days after the Netflix deal was announced, Paramount launched a hostile bid valued at $108.4 billion, offering $30 per share. The WBD board rejected this offer, calling it “illusory” and claiming that Paramount had misled shareholders about the proposed deal’s financing. At the time of the rejection, the board noted that the deal with Netflix was “a binding agreement with enforceable commitments, with no need for any equity financing and robust debt commitments.”

Now, Paramount’s amended offer has been designed to “address WBD’s stated concerns regarding Paramount’s superior offer,” Paramount said. In October, CNBC reported that, prior to the Netflix deal, WBD had previously rejected three different takeover offers from Paramount.

“Paramount has repeatedly demonstrated its commitment to acquiring WBD,” said Paramount Skydance CEO David Ellison, in Monday’s press release. “Our $30 per share, fully financed all-cash offer was on December 4th, and continues to be, the superior option to maximize value for WBD shareholders. Because of our commitment to investment and growth, our acquisition will be superior for all WBD stakeholders, as a catalyst for greater content production, greater theatrical output, and more consumer choice.”

He added: “We expect the board of directors of WBD to take the necessary steps to secure this value-enhancing transaction and preserve and strengthen an iconic Hollywood treasure for the future.”

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">ChatGPT is releasing its own version of Spotify Wrapped. That is, the OpenAI-owned chatbot is now rolling out an annual review feature called “Your Year with ChatGPT” to eligible consumers in select markets, including the United States.

Other English-speaking markets with access to the new offering include Canada, the U.K., Australia, and New Zealand.

At launch, the feature will be offered to those with the free, Plus, and Pro plans who have the “reference saved memories” and “reference chat history” options turned on and have met a minimum conversation activity threshold, the company told TechCrunch via email.

Team, Enterprise, or Education accounts will not be able to use the “Your Year with ChatGPT” feature. In addition, the experience is meant to be “lightweight, privacy-forward, and user-controlled,” the company noted.

Similar to other annual reviews offered by consumer apps, “Your Year with ChatGPT” takes inspiration from the popular year-end look back, Spotify Wrapped. Like Spotify’s feature, OpenAI uses catchy graphics and personalizes the experience to the individual by giving out “awards” based on how you’ve used ChatGPT throughout the year.

For instance, you might be awarded with the “Creative Debugger” if you used the chatbot to come up with solutions to a problem or worked through a concept or idea.

The app also creates a poem and an image about your year focused on your topics of interest. (We’re wondering how this will look next year as ChatGPT embraces adult content in 2026.)

While the year-end wrap-up will be promoted on the ChatGPT app’s home screen, it won’t be forced on users or opened automatically.

It will be available on the ChatGPT web app and mobile app for iOS and Android, the company says.

You also can ask ChatGPT directly for “Your Year with ChatGPT” to trigger the experience.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The CEO of SpaceX rival United Launch Alliance, Tory Bruno, has resigned after 12 years on the job “to pursue another opportunity,” according to the company.

“We are grateful for Tory’s service to ULA and the country, and we thank him for his leadership,” United Launch Alliance (ULA) chairs Robert Lightfoot and Kay Sears said in a statement.

Bruno’s resignation comes at a time when newer private spaceflight companies are increasingly driving the launch market. Elon Musk’s SpaceX has dramatically upped its launch cadence in recent years, and Jeff Bezos’ Blue Origin is looking like a more serious player after the mostly successful inaugural missions of the New Glenn heavy-lift rocket.

Now 20 years old, ULA was created by combining the space launch businesses of defense contractors Boeing and Lockheed Martin. ULA was a main provider to both NASA and the Department of Defense until SpaceX came along and started winning contracts.

One of Bruno’s biggest projects during his time at ULA was overseeing the development of the joint venture’s next-generation rocket, Vulcan. That project had two main objectives: help ULA keep pace with SpaceX, and reduce the U.S. government’s reliance on Russian rockets to access space.

Vulcan leveraged a number of parts from prior ULA rocket programs like Atlas and Delta in an attempt to keep costs down, though it bet on Blue Origin to provide the engines. The project suffered numerous delays before it finally lifted off for the first time in 2024 — one whole decade after development began.

During that same time frame, SpaceX became the world’s most dominant space launch provider, winning government contracts and taking on numerous private missions.

ULA’s Vulcan rocket has found customers in Amazon (for its Leo internet satellites) and space startup Astrobotic. And the company is looking to make the rockets more reusable, or even fly upgraded versions that could theoretically take heavier payloads to space.

“It has been a great privilege to lead ULA through its transformation and to bring Vulcan into service. My work here is now complete and I will be cheering ULA on,” Bruno said in a post on X.

ULA has tapped its chief operating officer John Elbon to serve as interim CEO while the company looks for a permanent replacement.

Sean O’Kane is a reporter who has spent a decade covering the rapidly-evolving business and technology of the transportation industry, including Tesla and the many startups chasing Elon Musk. Most recently, he was a reporter at Bloomberg News where he helped break stories about some of the most notorious EV SPAC flops. He previously worked at The Verge, where he also covered consumer technology, hosted many short- and long-form videos, performed product and editorial photography, and once nearly passed out in a Red Bull Air Race plane.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The good news: We are saying “Merry Christmas” again. (It is now compulsory, or the FCC will come for your license.) The bad news: Christmas rationing is indeed in effect.

Please consider the following gifting instructions from our president, who is also tightening his belt this Christmas (only demolishing one wing of the White House to install a lavish ballroom instead of both).

For Grandma: A tariff! Did they not want tariffs? That’s what we got everyone. Sorry.

For Uncle Greg: A TINY CAR!!! (We’re making these now.)

For Her: A photoshoot with Vanity Fair. Nothing says “glamour” like Vanity Fair. Usually. But sometimes the picture they take of you comes out looking like Dorian Gray’s DMV photo—unflattering, but in a way that implies deep spiritual corruption. This gives a fun Russian-roulette aspect to the gift!

For the Man Who Has Everything: Surprise MRI for no reason! Donald Trump has everything and he keeps getting these, so they must be a fun, cool luxury item and not cause for any kind of alarm.

For the Historian: Piece of East Wing rubble, possibly haunted. Does someone in your life love history or respect White House traditions? Great! We have a bunch of junk to unload on a mark like her.

For the Frequent Flier: Air Force One, lightly used. We’ve just received a better plane from Qatar. If you fly private, you can wear whatever you want to the airport, even pajamas!

For the Vaccine-Skeptical: Measles. A special surprise from the Trump administration. Don’t know what to get your child? That might not be a problem next year.

For Everyone Else on Your List: AI Something? There’s demand for this, isn’t there? Please tell us there’s demand, or the whole economy is going to break.

For Your Uncle (You’ll Know Which One): This John McNaughton painting titled The Secret Service, which features Donald Trump and some angels.

For That Special Someone: A presidential pardon. Just because! You never know when one of these will come in handy. It’ll have everyone but the recipient saying “You shouldn’t have!,” especially when that special someone goes on to commit additional crimes.

For the Budding Artist in Your Life: One or two pencils. (“You can give up certain products … Every child [can’t] get 37 pencils. They only need one or two. They don’t need that many,” President Trump explained a few months ago.) We understand that this raises a question: Who was buying 37 pencils before? Are these colored pencils or just standard No. 2 Ticonderogas? We don’t know! Good luck with this oddly specific presidential instruction.

For Your Daughter: One doll, or, perhaps, if you are feeling indulgent, two! (“Two or three is nice. You don’t need 37 dolls.”  — the president, again.) Indeed, apply this guidance generally. Instead of a box full of crayons, consider one or two loose crayons! Instead of an advent calendar full of toys, consider an advent calendar empty of toys! Instead of a candy cane, consider no candy mobility aids at all, which reek of accessibility and imply concessions to Tiny Tim.

Remember, there’s nothing more disappointing than a tree that has too many presents under it. Then you can’t properly see the tree. Also remember that not having a job will build resilience. Donald Trump briefly did not have a job and now look at him. He’s King of the United States!

If you’re still feeling the pinch, consider culling your list. Don’t give any gifts to adults, unless that adult is Border Czar Tom Homan, in which case you can give him $50,000 cash in a discreet CAVA bag. There are two ways to remove people from your list: through attrition and through measles (see above).

If you’re still at a loss, maybe just get everyone one big egg (Large, Grade A). Or some coal!

Coal can be an amazing gift. Timeless. Classic. She is the moment, to quote something the Department of Energy actually posted on X.

Before buying, be sure to check where your gifts were manufactured! Gifts produced at the North Pole are unfortunately subject to tariffs, just as with the islands-uninhabited-except-by-penguins situation. Those penguins know what they did.</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">“There is no single anecdote,” Jen Percy writes in the opening sentence of Girls Play Dead, her riveting, heartrending analysis of what sexual assault does to women. “What I’m talking about is an accumulation.” She lists a few of her own encounters with harassment and rape culture: the man who rubbed his crotch while staring at Percy and her friend; the man working a cash register who asked to touch her breasts; the man who asked to photograph her when she was 16, showing her an album of naked women. The point isn’t to interrogate the men who supposedly did these things, or whether they happened. (With regard to veracity, I have my own accumulation of similar anecdotes; I’m guessing most women do.) More useful is to consider what Percy did in response, what so many do when faced with sexually threatening behavior: nothing.

Girls are socialized to be pleasant. To be passive. To neutralize conflict rather than spark it. They learn to prioritize others’ feelings over their own. In 1988, the feminist legal scholar Robin West argued that these habits and behaviors help foster intimacy and community, but that they also diminish women’s protection under the law. If someone’s instinct is to preserve relationships and stability as a matter of survival, what do they do when they’re violently or sexually threatened? Not always something that might be construed as logical, or that might convince a jury that they have been gravely violated. The majority of women who are sexually assaulted don’t fight back, Percy notes. (In addition to “fight or flight” responses to danger, advocacy groups indicate that other common responses to rape include “freeze,” “flop,” and “friend,” or trying to placate one’s attacker.) She compiles a list of accounts from her reporting of things women have done after they were raped. “I made him chicken soup,” one woman tells her. “I comforted him because he was crying,” another says. Still another: “I told him I couldn’t wait to do it again.”

Girls Play Dead began as a feature Percy wrote in The New York Times Magazine about the phenomenon of “tonic immobility,” a self-preservation mechanism that leads people to freeze or become paralyzed when under attack. In the animal kingdom, mammals play dead so that a predator will lose interest in them; some female dragonflies do it to avoid mating. Percy encounters so many women who describe freezing as their response to sexual assault that she pronounces it a kind of “lingua franca.” (Men freeze too, she notes; her focus is largely but not exclusively on women.) “I just froze,” Lady Gaga said in an episode of the series The Me You Can’t See, while recalling the time she was raped at 19. “I just absolutely froze,” Brooke Shields said of her own rape in the documentary Pretty Baby. While I was reading Girls Play Dead, I watched a BBC documentary in which a woman, recounting being raped by her own boyfriend, said, “The fact that I froze—it’s a feeling that absolutely takes over your body. You can’t move.” Tonic immobility, Percy writes, is an “extreme response to a threat” that “renders victims unable to scream or move their limbs.” Its evolutionary benefit, she notes, is that by simultaneously numbing the body, it might—in the animal world at least—“alleviate the agony and horror of being eaten alive.”

Percy’s subject is brutal, but her writing allays some of the impact by being almost impossibly beautiful: crisp, vulnerable, lyrical. Her mother, a naturalist, raised her partly in the wilderness, where hills “were painted with belts of ochre, orange, brick-red sand.” Sometimes the pair slept in a trailer, “with its stale formaldehyde smell, lacquer table, and tiny fridge that gasped as if afraid.” She has a miniaturist’s eye for detail and a raw compassion in her analysis. Girls Play Dead isn’t a manifesto, or a call to action. It’s more like a scientist’s collection of samples from a field trip, arranged by genus. Percy observes and bears witness. She interviews women in prison for murdering their abusers, after describing their biographies at harrowing, hard-to-read length. She interviews self-professed sex and love addicts who experienced childhood abuse and whose understanding of emotional connection got distorted. (“Abuse, neglect, or drama—it was all mistaken for intimacy,” Percy writes.)

On first reading, some of Percy’s stories seemed strange or incongruous, like the man she profiles who’s utterly obsessed with a woman he broke up with a decade ago. But I came to understand that woven into her line of inquiry are the nature and significance of storytelling itself. Police investigations and criminal trials demand clear narratives: They tend to expect evidence to be neat, behavior to be logical, and stories to be linear. The questions that rape victims tend to face don’t allow for the kind of messiness that accompanies violation. Often survivors themselves try to make sense of what has happened by reinterpreting it. “Self-preservation doesn’t always look like what we imagine it does,” Percy notes. She describes once going home with a man while studying abroad in Spain, and all of the times she said no, until she finally stopped, because “I was tired and I didn’t want to be rude.” Later, she went to Paris with him. Illogical, maybe, but commonplace all the same, because occasionally our coping mechanisms require transforming an abuse into something wanted, or at least something not so bad.

Read: Unbelievable is TV’s most humane show

In a court of law, though, irrational reactions—such as a sustained relationship with an abuser—can fatally undermine a victim’s credibility. Defense lawyers, Percy writes, have a pronounced tendency “to portray the normal behavior of women, both during and after their experiences, as ‘unusual’ or ‘inconsistent.’” During the trial of Harvey Weinstein, his defense lawyers put significant emphasis on the fact that two of his accusers had continued friendly communication with him after their alleged attacks, and had even gone on to have consensual sex with him. “Many individuals may not understand why I had hoped that attempting human connection with the man who was sexually abusing me, humiliating me, using me, and pumping me into his world where he always controlled the script—was a long exhausting form of survival,” one accuser, Jessica Mann, read in a statement to the court during Weinstein’s sentencing hearing, by way of response. We are, as a culture, deeply uncomfortable with the idea of victimhood. (Consider the idiom “playing the victim.”) “Claiming victimhood,” Kate Manne writes in her book Down Girl, “effectively involves placing oneself at the center of the story.” And women who foreground themselves in any capacity are often perceived to be self-important drama queens, or narcissists.

Perhaps sensing this, Percy turns victims into a collective instead. Her stories, woven together, become something like a fabric, a totality. Messiness is the defining feature, in a way that becomes clarifying. Chronic stress damages the prefrontal cortex, she writes in one chapter, explaining how trauma can impair the brain so that her later accounts of women found guilty for acts of self-defense seem even more profoundly unjust. Girls Play Dead illuminates how stories can trap people, how the impulse to rewrite a violation or rescue an abuser leads us away from the truth. But Percy also seems to feel that showing us the texture and shared features of human experience might be the crucial thing that can make a difference. The law often renders women unprotected, maligned, and misunderstood. The only countermechanism, as Robin West wrote in 1988, “is to tell true stories of women’s lives,” in such breadth and definition that the justice system finally has to acknowledge what it’s been obscuring. Girls Play Dead is a vital continuation of this effort.

&quot;The human eye perceives somewhere between 30 and 60 FPS&quot;

This is absolute bullshit. Humans can track significantly faster than this, its just that at around 24 frames a second (assuming proper motion smoothing from captured footage), things START to appear animated rather than a series of stills.

There is a reason why 240Hz monitors exist. Check out Blur Busters tests, such as https://testufo.com/ [testufo.com] - on a 240Hz OLED panel there is a distinct difference between 120Hz and 240Hz. And now we&#39;re pushing monitor tech well beyond this level of refresh rate.

There have also been countless tests done to show that higher framerates in fast paced games has a measurable impact on human processing latency.

It&#39;s not bullshit, it&#39;s just imprecise. Your fovea sees higher frame rates on a very small point your are directly looking at, but the wider picture frame rate does start to become very difficult for the vast majority of people to see the difference at around 60 fps.

I saw the first Avatar movie and thought it was pretty good.

Just recently, I watched the second Avatar movie and I could not enjoy it because the whole thing seemed artificial. The CGI was rampant and it was bordering cartoonish.

I read recently that the third film as filmed at the same time as the second, so I presume that it looks as bad or worse than the seconds. I won&#39;t be in any hurry to watch it.

do all projectors deal with that mode swtich fine or do they fall back into an more basic mode for the rest of the movie?

3D viewing isn&#39;t eye strain but &quot;brain strain,&quot; caused when parallax-sensitive neurons struggle to process jumping vertical edges. Higher frame rates smooth this out. When critics questioned the approach, Cameron was characteristically blunt. &quot;I think $2.3 billion says you might be wrong on that,&quot; he told DiscussingFilm, referencing The Way of Water&#39;s box office.
So... Cameron&#39;s saying people flocked to it for the frame rate, not the story? :-)

The average Joe or Jane doesnt want to do research on Linux support. Things just work on windows and Mac.

hahaha, you are clueless and wrong.  Half the people at work use macs and I have family member at home.  One needs to research Mac support before buying a printer/copier//scanner, for many models if you can&#39;t airprint you might be screwed or get janky results.

The real limitation is familiar software and ease of using things like printers. I don&#39;t know what you use but CUPS has unified and simplified printing across Linux and Unix platforms since the early 2000s. Windows printing unfortunately can be a mess as it relies on drivers from manufacturers. Case in point, I had a Samsung printer/scanner/copier. It ran fine in Linux, MacOS, and Windows. Then HP acquired the Samsung print business. Drivers became buggy. Drivers tries to install unnecessary applications like HP Smart App as some functions simply do not work without it.

What Linux needs is users, a lot more - and to get those users they need to have support from major software vendors, and that support needs to be publicized widely.

Why would an open source OS challenge Windows?Perhaps a few like to, but I think it&#39;s a misconception that most OS/distros are in it to challenge Windows. This creating of a non-existent conflict is so old.

I agree.The point of OSS is to have an alternative for people to choose.There are many arguments about the &quot;best&quot; OS.Some people investigate and choose Linux.I&#39;m happy that there are a lot of people who just go with the crowd and leave my Linux alone.I am happy with the greater security and functionality of a less popular OS.

This is the solution needed to get Linux onto the desktop. Yes Linux is a hobby project. Businesses do not want millions of daily value running on something without commercial support. People want software thats easy to use. People know windows and Mac and so find it easy.

argues that the proliferation of Linux desktops -- more than a dozen significant interfaces exist today, and DistroWatch lists &quot;upwards of a hundred&quot; -- makes it nearly impossible for ordinary users to know where to start.

Thank you...  

I worked in a Unix shop in the 1990s and I know almost nothing about how to choose / install /administer Linux today.  The choices may as well be infinite, and by definition an amateur can&#39;t deal with its features via a simple GUI, so he&#39;s lost without exerting nerdy effort.  I get it, *nix is powerful, but most users don&#39;t need nearly that.  Since there&#39;s no path toward standardization and hobbyists can&#39;t leave well enough alone (not to mention the bugs created by changes), I think it&#39;ll simply remain where it is when it comes to general user acceptance.  Too bad...

nonsense.  the distro war has been won, by Ubuntu and things that are Ubuntu with lipstick that can run the same .deb

Plenty of people have popped in a Linux Mint (for example) install media and run with it, no tech knowledge needed if there is a network with dhcp and/or SLAAC

If you use some fringe distro and struggle with it that&#39;s on you.  You&#39;re easily distracted.

What the Linux Desktop Really Needs To Challenge Windows
Arbitrary unnecessary hardware &quot;requirements&quot; and forced cloud accounts to install ... ? 
Or did you mean challenge in a good way? ;-)

The above two things are why I&#39;m switching to Linux (Mint) full time rather than &quot;upgrading&quot; to Windows 11, I don&#39;t really need more reasons.

I use command-line Linux every day. Last month I tried to get my 2015 MacBook running a Linux desktop. Turns out a kernel regression broke the video driver I need. After I worked through that, by disabling the video driver, I found that standby was not triggered by a lid closure. I also found that after manually invoking standby it was impossible to resume. And finally, changes in charging status, like hitting fully charged, would cause the system to turn on. So even if I was ok with a full boot every time I used the system, the act of charging the system would leave the system fully powered up at the crypt screen with the lid closed.

Similar experience as my past experiences in the mid 90s and mid 00s.

is it isn&#39;t easy to use for the average user. The reason why people like apple is because anybody&#39;s grandma can use it. The reason why people like windows is you don&#39;t have to understand a command line do run windows. The UI&#39;s are polished. Linux and FOSS can&#39;t figure out that good software has polish. Not many FOSS wants to do this and can&#39;t afford it, commercial can. Not many programmers want to spend time polishing up a program, they want to code and create new features. And I&#39;m going out on a limb, but I&#39;m willing to bet that many projects do not have dedicated UI people that gather feedback and do product testing.The average user doesn&#39;t want to look at a readme.txt, they want to push a button and have software that is easy and intuitive to use. Do programmers care about that? Not really, they can go and re-write the software themselves.

The last problem is that software is not available for Linux but that is less of an issue in recent years.

If Linux wants to be usable they need to fix those issues.

You don&#39;t have to use a command line to run desktop Linux.

The Linux desktop needs apps, polish and hardware support. Apps the most.

It&#39;s a real operating system, not just a group of projects bolted together by a team of people from Google. Same with ChromeOS.

The best path forward for &quot;desktop Linux,&quot; IMHO, is for KDE to formally enter the OS market via a rebranded Neon that is highly opinionated about ABI compatibility, Snap vs FlatPak/etc. and stuff like that. KDE is by far the DE most ready to go toe to toe with Windows both with users and developers because Qt is night and day more robust than its competition AFAICT.

&quot;DEB and RPM do not scale for the desktop&quot;. That is the most bullshit line I have heard in a very very long time. It is not that they don&#39;t scale for the desktop. DEB and RPM are much better for the health of the desktop than any atomic package manager like SNAP, appimage or flatpak. Atomic package managers are just because of laziness. Just an extension of the same problem as application bloat in other ways. It is nothing more than devs not wanting to put in the time to optimize their installers. They alwa

If MS Office were available on Linux and games had direct support (not just interpretative engines) then Linux would take off. MS office on MacOS is partly why MacOS is a viable OS platform.

I&#39;ll buy that assertion.  Although, I&#39;ve recently switched from Office (2010 to using LibreOffice - in preparation for switching from Windows 10 to Linux Mint full-time - and found the latter acceptable, though some tweaking and re-work was needed, especially for the spreadsheets.  My Publisher files (mostly greeting cards) are another matter and even using Scribus will be a bunch of work to migrate.  Having Office on Linux would make things much easier.

We had this discussion in 2023. And in 2021. 2020, 2019, 2017, 2015, 2013, 2011, 2009, 2008, 2007 and I think 2005. Or so.

Oh dear, poor users don&#39;t know where to start. I&#39;m sure that is the one and only thing that stops the entire world from switching to Linux. Certainly not the lack of games, business applications or compelling reasons to switch from the shit that they currently run and know is shit but at least they know that shit.

Linux has won the server OS wars. When&#39;s the last time anyone had a serious discussion of using whatever the last windows server OS version is for anything critical? When&#39;s the last time you logged into a Solaris machine?

The desktop is a different game, always has been, always will be. It&#39;s a game run not by technical excellent. I mean, exhibit A: DOS and Windows, who were never, ever, the best OS - just the most popular one. But on the desktop, what matters is if the users can use it (it&#39;s right there in the word) and that hinges on two things: a) familiarity and b) availability of applications.

a) is a lot more serious than most of us nerds realize. Think about any random corporation. Let&#39;s say 5000 office employees currently using Windows. Re-training them to use Linux instead might take just a few hours for the tech-savvy ones, and let&#39;s say a day for the less so. Add twice that as a period where productivity is at least somewhat hampered by them having to look up again or ask a colleague how to do X. Suddenly you&#39;re looking at something like 30-50 thousand hours of lost productivity. And these are not minimum-wage people. So your bill is what, half a million?

b) this is the applications the business actually uses, not some Open Source alternative. If the graphics designers use Photoshop, they need that, not Gimp. Tons and tons of enterprise software is windows-only. And there we are with the chicken-and-egg problem.

Seriously, &quot;the Linux desktop is too fragmented&quot; is bullshit. All things considered, that&#39;s the least worry of anyone. And one of the greatest strengths. I know that I would&#39;ve given up completely on Linux a lot sooner than I actually did if there had only been KDE and Gnome, and not Enlightenment and other interesting options pushing the boundary of the possible. Heck, E would still run circles around almost all UIs today.

Linux desktop remains hamstrung by the same fragmentation that killed Unix decades ago. Steven J. Vaughan-Nichols, writing in The Register, argues that the proliferation of Linux desktops -- more than a dozen significant interfaces exist today, and DistroWatch lists &quot;upwards of a hundred&quot; -- makes it nearly impossible for ordinary users to know where to start  [theregister.com].
I don&#39;t buy the &quot;The Paradox of Choice&quot; argument here.  Yes, there are a *bunch* of distros - probably too many - but to each their own.  Unless you have a super specific need or want, any of the top 5 or 10 will almost certainly work for you.  Just pick one.

Linux desktop remains hamstrung by the same fragmentation that killed Unix decades ago. Steven J.

I don&#39;t buy the &quot;The Paradox of Choice&quot; argument here.  Yes, there are a *bunch* of distros - probably too many - but to each their own.

Earlier this month, shortly after a series of Democratic wins in off-year elections, in the government shutdown, and in nosediving polls for President Donald Trump, a number of key Democrats made some unusual choices. First, New Jersey Democratic Rep. Josh Gottheimer began once again hawking the “Porch Pirates Act,” a bill that nobody seemed to have asked for and which could come back to haunt his party if passed. Then, this week, the Democratic National Committee announced it would not release its highly anticipated 2024 autopsy report.

Why, amid its first signs of life since the devastating 2024 election results, is the party seemingly determined to take multiple steps backward?

Let’s start with Gottheimer and porch pirates. Standing proud at a podium set up in his home district on Dec. 1, Gottheimer preached how private companies like Amazon, United Parcel Service, and FedEx should receive even greater protections than the federal agency the United States Postal Service. Currently, it’s a federal crime to steal mail out of any USPS post office, letter box, or mail receptacle, with violators facing a fine and prison time of no more than five years. The Porch Pirates Act would expand on this, adding Americans’ porches to the protected mail space, and it would make stealing a package from a private porch a federal crime with punishment of up to 10 years in prison and $250,000 in fines.

The legislation would also give the Federal Bureau of Investigations, Justice Department, and federal task forces the authority to “fully investigate porch theft.” There are already laws on the books that cover these sorts of thefts and any potential greater conspiracies that might be involved in them. The Porch Pirates Act is not only redundant, it is excessively punitive, especially when Democrats have spent multiple general election cycles in a row battling the image among younger voters of having boosted mass incarceration during the 1990s. It seems unwise to reopen this fight.

The Porch Pirates Act was first introduced back in 2022, but has since seen basically no movement in Congress. Last year, Democrat Dean Phillips, a former representative and sponsor of the bill, went so far as to film a video where he shadowed a UPS driver who seemed amused at best to be sharing his route with a congressman. The final product looks and sounds alarmingly like a paid UPS commercial rather than a genuine explanation for why the Porch Pirates Act is necessary. Now, it seems like Gottheimer is taking a stab at attempting to push the legislation forward.

Let’s be clear, out of all the problems American consumers are currently facing, like the impending explosion of health care costs, stubbornly high inflation on everyday goods, and rising unemployment, why do some Democrats view package theft as among voters’ top concerns? (A previous version of the bill had 17 Democratic co-sponsors, though it’s unclear how many this one has.)

Besides the irrelevant nature of the Porch Pirates Act, it also stands to significantly contribute to the country’s mass incarceration problem. Penalizing thieves for stealing some Amazon packages with prison time and fines in the hundreds of thousands would drag an already overburdened criminal justice system down even further, inevitably also increasing the cost of running state and federal prisons. It’s well documented that mass incarceration leads to poor physical, psychological, and economic outcomes for people who experience imprisonment, which ends up hurting all American communities.

The USPS Office of Inspector General even published a white paper earlier this year acknowledging the pesky problem of package theft, and recommended collaborative strategies—not criminal penalties. “Offering and making use of flexible and secure delivery options, leveraging technology for enhanced tracking and theft prevention, [and] utilizing discreet packaging and package delivery placement” were among the recommended solutions.

The Porch Pirates Act also threatens to be a repeat of the infamous crime bill of the 1990s that led to a consistent rise in incarceration rates for the following decade, and which Democrats paid for dearly. The party surely does not want to be responsible for adding yet another pathway to prison.

Unfortunately, it appears Democrats are keen to end 2025 on the wrong foot. Instead of acknowledging its faults and reckoning with its consistently low approval ratings this year, the Democratic National Committee decided to continue ignoring its problems by scrapping the public release of its 2024 autopsy report. Claiming it would simply distract and divide the party, the lack of accountability now sets the stage for Democrats to repeat the same grave mistakes in the 2026 midterms and beyond. Party establishment gets to continue its iron grip, no fundamental changes will be made to Democrats’ platform, but hey, at least they can say they fought for Americans’ porches.

Ever since he returned to the White House, President Donald Trump has taken a sledgehammer to the federal workforce, attempting to purge tens of thousands of civil servants and shutter entire agencies. The Supreme Court has largely rubber-stamped these mass layoffs, even when they frustrated congressional commands expressly intended to direct, structure, and constrain the executive branch. Last month, however, Congress struck back in a little-noticed move that shifted power away from the Trump administration by outlawing further illegal firings and reversing those already underway. And on Wednesday, U.S. District Judge Susan Illston issued an injunction enforcing the new law, rejecting the government’s brazen attempt to defy it.

On this week’s Slate Plus bonus episode of Amicus, co-hosts Dahlia Lithwick and Mark Joseph Stern discuss the ruling and its encouraging implications for the separation of powers and a bolstered Congress subject to a president who refuses to acknowledge most limits on his authority. Their conversation has been edited and condensed for clarity.

Dahlia Lithwick: Judge Susan Illston has been battling the administration over these layoffs for months now. Why was this latest round different?

Mark Joseph Stern: Because Congress did something that was long overdue—it wrote a statute that tightly constrains the executive branch. And Illston actually enforced it as written against the Trump administration.

Recall that during the shutdown, the president moved forward with mass layoffs across a bunch of federal agencies. They were euphemistically called “reductions in force.” People lost their jobs, their paychecks, their housing, even overseas postings. It was a disaster. And Trump claimed that the shutdown gave him broader leeway to purge the civil and foreign service and also to use those layoffs to inflict pain on Democrats because they were refusing to capitulate and reopen the government.

When Congress finally did end the shutdown on Nov. 12 and reopened the government, the funding bill that it passed included a provision that directly reversed Trump’s layoffs in two ways. First, the bill declared that “no federal funds may be used to initiate, carry out, implement, or otherwise notice a reduction in force” through late January, when funding expires again. That language clearly bars any further steps to lay off federal employees through the end of next month. Second, the bill said that any reduction in force “proposed, noticed, initiated, executed, implemented, or otherwise taken” during the shutdown “shall have no force or effect.” That language clearly reinstates any federal employee who was either told they’d be laid off during the shutdown or actually laid off.

To no one’s surprise, the administration immediately tried to repeal that language by reinterpreting it to mean almost nothing. Russell Vought—a Project 2025 author and now the director of the Office of Management and Budget—decreed that the first provision barred the government only from sending additional RIF notices through January but would allow it to complete the many, many layoffs that had already been initiated. Vought then said that the second provision applied only if a layoff notice went out during the shutdown. He claimed that if the employee had been warned earlier in the year that they were going to be fired and the actual firing happened during the shutdown, then the layoff was still lawful. The Trump administration tried to exploit that ridiculous interpretation by rescinding layoff notices that had been sent during the shutdown and immediately reissuing them to say: You have a new notice that came after the shutdown, so we can legally fire you.

On Wednesday, Illston shut this down. First, she said that there can be no layoffs through January, period. The bill announced that no federal funds can be used to carry out or implement RIFs. That means what it says. It does not allow the administration to fire people who previously received a notice that they’d be fired. Second, the judge ordered the reinstatement of everyone who was either told they’d be fired or actually fired during the shutdown. Remember, Congress reversed any RIF that was “noticed,” “executed,” or “implemented” during the shutdown. That covers everybody who was subject to any aspect of the RIF process. So, thanks to Illston’s order, all of those people now get their jobs back. That covers hundreds of employees right now, and possibly thousands more in the coming month, given the plans that Vought was developing for another round of the purges that Congress had outlawed.

How is it that congressional Republicans allowed this language? Did it just escape their notice? Were they secretly opposed to the RIFs as well?

No—this was a bargain struck by Senate Democrats. Republicans needed their help to end the shutdown, and a group of Democrats conditioned their votes on statutory language that would halt the RIFs. All Illston is doing here is enforcing that language in the face of the Trump administration brazenly defying Congress. I know that her decision will prompt another round of allegations that Illston is a “resistance judge”—especially since she tried to halt the RIFs earlier this year and the Supreme Court reversed her on the shadow docket. But there’s a difference between what happened in July and what’s happening now: The law has changed! Democrats in Congress saw that the existing law gave too much discretion to the executive branch. And they decided that if they were going to end the shutdown, they would at least force Congress to reassert its power and end that discretion.

That was, I think, a hugely successful move, not just for the Democratic Party and the civil service, but for Congress’ standing as a coordinate branch of government. We have been waiting for this since Trump came back into the White House. Congress has ceded the field to the presidency for nearly 11 months. It has handed over all of these powers to Trump, and the Supreme Court has overturned almost any judge who tries to kind of protect Congress’ prerogatives. Here, finally, we have Congress saying, in the most explicit language possible: We have the power of the purse. The money that we are appropriating may not be used by the Trump administration to purge the civil service. That gives me the first glimmer of hope I’ve had in a very long time that Democrats will be able to use their leverage to reassert Congress’ primacy over funding, rein in some of the White House’s abuses of power, and give SCOTUS no choice but to enforce the laws that they enact against him.

In one sense, this is a preliminary injunction from a single judge in a blue state that some will write off as “Trump derangement syndrome.” But for you, this is a masterclass in what Democrats can do—from the minority—when they theoretically have no power. This is, as you say, a flex for Congress. It’s a flex for text and statutory language. It’s a flex for using negotiations to leverage congressional prerogatives that have just been ceded to the executive branch.

And let’s also take a step back: Senate Democrats shouldn’t have been in this position in the first place. Trump’s mass layoffs were illegal. Congress did not allow him to dismantle these agencies by purging their workers. The courts should have been able to stop that. But the Supreme Court consistently stepped in and reversed them on the shadow docket, seemingly on the grounds that the executive branch has a lot of discretion and the statutes don’t tell us exactly what Congress wanted.

So the problem wasn’t just Trump abusing his power. It was also SCOTUS taking advantage of ambiguous statutory language and gaps that nobody had previously thought to exploit in the law. Congressional Democrats correctly identified that as one of the foundational issues here: not just Trump’s abuses, but the way the court was able to green-light those abuses. So they wrote language that would explicitly block Trump from misusing his power and force the courts, including SCOTUS, to implement congressional prerogatives. I do think that Illston will be upheld on appeal; I’m not even sure that the administration will try to appeal this to the Supreme Court. This is cut-and-dried, because Democrats in Congress saw the gaps that needed to be plugged and plugged them.

            <div id="article-text">Interview &quot;In my past life, it would take us 360 days to develop an amazing zero day,&quot; Zafran Security CEO Sanaz Yashar said.

She&#39;s talking about the 15 years she spent working as a spy - she prefers &quot;hacking architect&quot; - inside the Israel Defense Forces&#39; elite cyber group, Unit 8200.

&quot;Now, the volume and speed is changing so much that for the first time ever, we have a negative time-to-exploit, meaning it takes less than a day to see vulnerabilities being exploited, being weaponized before they were patched,&quot; Yashar told The Register. &quot;That is not something you used to see.&quot;

The reason: AI. This technology isn&#39;t helping criminals develop novel or more sophisticated attack chains entirely without humans in the loop, she said. &quot;But AI is helping the threat actors do more, and faster,&quot; according to Yashar - and the more and faster is what worries her.

As a teen, Yashar&#39;s family moved from Tehran to Israel, and the Israeli military intelligence corps recruited her while she was working as a research assistant at Tel Aviv University.

In 2022, Yashar co-founded Zafran, which uses AI to help companies map and manage their cyber-threat exposure. But before heading up her own security startup, she led threat intelligence at Cybereason and worked as a manager at Google&#39;s incident response and threat intel biz, Mandiant.

AI is helping the threat actors do more, and faster

She&#39;s citing Mandiant&#39;s recent analysis that found the average time-to-exploit (TTE) in 2024 hit -1. This is how Google and Mandiant define the average number of days it takes attackers to exploit a bug before or after the vendor issues a patch, and this is the first time ever the security analysts have seen a negative TTE. Crims are getting to exploit bugs a day before they&#39;re patched now.

&quot;And we saw 78 percent of the vulnerabilities being weaponized by LLMs and AI,&quot; Yashar said.

In addition to attackers using AI to improve the speed and efficiency of breaches, organizations&#39; increasing use of this same technology - in some cases, just stuffing AI into every product and process - expands the attack surface.

This includes attackers misusing corporate AI systems through things like prompt injection and tricking AI agents into bypassing safety guardrails to develop exploit chains, or access data they&#39;re not supposed to.

Plus, there&#39;s also software vulnerabilities within the AI systems and frameworks themselves, and Yashar worries about the &quot;collateral damage&quot; caused from exploiting these bugs, especially if they fall into the hands of &quot;junior&quot; hackers: the Scattered Spider, ShinyHunters-type cybercrime collectives or governments just beginning to develop or buy a cyber-weapons arsenal or experimenting with agentic AI.

&quot;Sometimes the ones that don&#39;t understand what they are doing are more dangerous than Russia, Iran, Israel, US, China - they understand what can happen if something goes wrong,&quot; she explained. &quot;Even if they do bad things, there is a decision they understand.&quot;

&quot;The new threat actors are going to utilize these vulnerabilities, not understanding that they can shut down half of the world,&quot; Yashar said. &quot;And the collateral damage is going to be something that we cannot expect and we cannot deal with. I do think the WannaCry of AI has not yet happened. It&#39;s going to happen. I don&#39;t know where it&#39;s going to come from, but it&#39;s going to happen. The question is, how are you going to mitigate - because you cannot remediate it - so how you&#39;re going to mitigate your own risk?&quot;

WannaCry, which took place in May 2017, was one of the largest worldwide ransomware attacks, hitting hundreds of thousands of computers and causing untold damage that&#39;s estimated to be in the hundreds of millions or billions.

The answer, according to Yashar, is also AI. Not coincidentally, Zafran has developed a threat-exposure management platform that uses AI to find and remediate exploitable vulnerabilities and perform proactive threat hunting.

&quot;The way we do security is going to completely change,&quot; she said. &quot;Companies that just show you insight wouldn&#39;t be enough. They have to get the job done. And to get the job done, you need to use agents, even with human intel.&quot;

AI agents will investigate and triage threats, and develop an action plan for an organization to mitigate them. &quot;The AI is going to build those packages according to your risk appetite, and there&#39;s going to be a human to make sure that you want to do this action according to your risk appetite,&quot; Yashar said.

Humans, she adds, will remain in the loop for the foreseeable future because &quot;human behaviour changes slower than technology,&quot; and when it comes to completely turning over the reins to AI agents, we&#39;re not there yet. ®

Citing persons familiar with the matter, Reuters reports that initial orders will be fulfilled using existing stock with between 5,000 and 10,000 HGX boards totaling 40,000 to 80,000 GPUs up for grabs.

This suggests that Nvidia will be prioritizing the more powerful SXM variant of the H200, which is better suited for training applications than its PCIe-based NVL cards.

Nvidia recently received the go-ahead from the Trump administration to begin selling its older H200 accelerators to the Middle Kingdom for the first time. The decision marked a significant reversal of long-standing trade policy earlier this month. In exchange, Nvidia will cut Uncle Sam in on 25 percent of the revenues from the sale. Nvidia&#39;s most powerful Blackwell-based chips remain unobtainium in the Chinese market, with little indication that&#39;ll change any time soon.

The Trump administration had previously proposed a 15 percent sales tax to restore sales of H20s, a nerfed version of the H200, in China back in July. Despite this, Hopper sales have fallen off considerably over the past year, accounting for $2 billion in sales in Q3. Of that, H20 sales only account for $50 million, with CFO Colette Kress placing the blame on &quot;geopolitical issues and the increasingly competitive market in China.&quot;

According to Reuters, Nvidia has warned its customers that the timing of shipments will depend heavily on approval by authorities in Beijing.

The Middle Kingdom has become increasingly hostile towards Nvidia in recent months, with government authorities reportedly pressuring hyperscalers to drop Nvidia in favor of domestic alternatives. The nation has also moved to block state-funded datacenters from deploying foreign AI chips.

But if these hurdles can be overcome, the Chinese market represents a massive opportunity for Nvidia. On the company&#39;s Q2 earnings call, CEO Jensen Huang estimated that China would have been a $50 billion market in 2025 if it&#39;d been allowed to sell competitive products in the region.

If Nvidia is successful in convincing China to approve H200 shipments, Reuters reports that production of Hopper GPUs could resume at foundry partner TSMC with additional capacity available starting in the second half of 2026.

“We continuously manage our supply chain. Licensed sales of the H200 to authorized customers in China will have no impact on our ability to supply customers in the United States,” a Nvidia spokesperson told The Register. ®

            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2025/12/22/hacktivists_scrape_songs_spotify/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">What would happen to the world&#39;s music collections if streaming services disappeared? One hacktivist group says it has a solution: scrape around 300 terabytes of music and metadata from Spotify and offer it up for free as what it calls the world’s first “fully open” music preservation archive.

The scraping appears to have been carried out by people associated with Anna&#39;s Archive, a shadow-library site that focuses on preserving media - traditionally books and academic papers - by aggregating metadata and distributing large datasets rather than directly hosting copyrighted works. In practice, Anna&#39;s Archive functions more like a metadata search engine, allowing users to find the content they want and connecting them with downloads, usually via torrent, from other sources to reduce legal liability.

In a Saturday blog post, the group said it couldn&#39;t pass up an opportunity &quot;outside of text&quot; to scrape Spotify at scale, claiming to have archived roughly 86 million music files, which it says account for about 99.6 percent of listens on the platform.

&quot;A while ago, we discovered a way to scrape Spotify at scale,&quot; Anna&#39;s Archive said. &quot;We saw a role for us here to build a music archive primarily aimed at preservation.&quot;

Anna&#39;s Archive justified its Spotify scraping by describing it as a &quot;humble attempt to start a &#39;preservation archive&#39; for music&quot; in order to protect &quot;humanity&#39;s musical heritage&quot; from &quot;destruction by natural disasters, wars, budget cuts, and other catastrophes.&quot;

In particular, the Anna&#39;s Archive team said that it wants to get around some of the most common problems in other music preservation initiatives, namely an &quot;over-focus on the most popular artists,&quot; an &quot;over-focus on the highest possible quality&quot; and a lack of authoritative torrent lists representing &quot;all music ever produced.&quot;

Those noble claims fall apart quickly upon further reading of Anna&#39;s Archive&#39;s blog post, though.

While 300 TB comprising roughly 86 million music files, which the group claims represent about 99.6 percent of Spotify’s listens, is a vast amount of audio, it falls well short of the platform’s full catalog. Anna’s Archive says Spotify contains around 256 million tracks in total, meaning the audio files it archived cover only about a third of the catalog, with the remaining tracks represented only in metadata rather than preserved as music files.

By not bothering with all the musical chaff in Spotify&#39;s catalog, the Anna&#39;s Archive team is apparently content to let those less popular songs languish despite their claim to want to avoid focusing on just the most popular artists.

It&#39;s not clear how the Archive intends to break up the 300 TB worth of music into torrent files, or if it intends to release one massive file (we reached out to the team but didn&#39;t hear back), but the blog notes that it&#39;s only going to be making it available via &quot;a torrents-only archive aimed at preservation&quot; that &quot;can easily be mirrored by anyone with enough disk space.&quot;

In short, the archival goal is one that butts up against letting users simply download the individual Spotify tracks they want, as that would just be plain old piracy.

As with its broader preservation rhetoric, Anna&#39;s Archive&#39;s claim of benevolence in releasing the collection strictly for archival purposes is undercut later in the blog post.

&quot;If there is enough interest, we could add downloading of individual files to Anna&#39;s Archive,&quot; volunteer member &quot;ez&quot; wrote on the blog. &quot;Please let us know if you&#39;d like this.&quot;

If Anna&#39;s Archive intended to return to the Spotify servers to scrape the remaining songs, it appears they might be too late, according to a Spotify spokesperson&#39;s comment to The Register.

&quot;Spotify has identified and disabled the nefarious user accounts that engaged in unlawful scraping,&quot; the company told us. &quot;We&#39;ve implemented new safeguards for these types of anti-copyright attacks and are actively monitoring for suspicious behavior.&quot;

No mention was made by either Spotify or Anna&#39;s Archive of how the scrapers managed to bypass Spotify&#39;s digital rights management software.

While Spotify didn&#39;t respond to questions about Anna&#39;s Archive&#39;s supposed preservation motivations, the company did note that it views the theft of tens of millions of pieces of intellectual property from its servers as a simple act of piracy, regardless of whether Spotify itself is a bit of an IP pirate that doesn&#39;t fairly pay its artists.

&quot;Since day one, we have stood with the artist community against piracy, and we are actively working with our industry partners to protect creators and defend their rights,&quot; Spotify said.

For now, metadata covering nearly all of Spotify&#39;s roughly 256 million tracks is available to download from Anna&#39;s Archive. The music files themselves aren&#39;t out yet, but the Archive claims that it&#39;s planning to release them - in order of popularity - sometime in the future. ®

            <div id="article-text">Bitcoin tried to evade the Feds. Now it wants to share a beer with them.

Bitcoin tried to evade the Feds. Now it wants to share a beer with them.

Bitcoin culture, by nature, is anarchical and chaotic. It has to be, given the nature of Bitcoin itself and the people who adopted it: free-market libertarians who’ve gone all in on turning computer code into a form of money divorced from central banks, government intervention, and traceability. In short, it’s the exact opposite culture of Washington, DC, home of the federal government, where everyone agrees that the American dollar exists and is worth X amount because the government says so.

So it was a bizarre shock to K Street, the corporate lobbying heart of the nation’s capital, when it was announced that Pubkey, a Bitcoin-themed dive bar from New York City, would open its second location in downtown DC — smack dab in expense-card restaurant territory. And that’s to say nothing of the local city news sites. “Raise your hand if you plan to never set foot in there,” wrote a commenter on PoPville, a popular Washington blog that chronicles local news and had broken the news of Pubkey’s opening.

Crypto has a highly controversial reputation in town, even apart from its general cultural reputation: the Biden administration had been aggressive in trying to curb the industry’s growth, claiming that several major corporations did not have sufficient anti-money laundering protections in place. President Donald Trump’s full-bore tilt in the opposite direction — dropping the Department of Justice’s efforts to prosecute crypto crimes, pardoning several crypto executives who’d been found guilty of various financial crimes, making his own meme coin — has turned the regulation of digital tokens into a deeply partisan issue.

“Our top priority is trying to figure out how to soften that [hostility],” Thomas Pacchia, the founder of Pubkey’s New York City location, told me. To hear Pacchia put it, Pubkey DC — located strategically in the heart of DC’s lobbying neighborhood and close enough to Capitol Hill — was going to be a vessel for the Bitcoin community’s political aspirations and influence. But rather than dump money into endless lobbying against the interests of much larger crypto behemoths (and to say nothing of traditional financial institutions), Pubkey was going to do it through soft power. Instead of policy white papers and government affairs work, they were going to invite people — Republican, Democrat, important people, not-important people — into their quirky, very nice, superchill world, full of Bitcoiners who wanted to work with the government rather than evade them at all costs.

First things first: hide the wonky policy stuff behind the bar — literally.

I’d heard through the lobbyist grapevine that Pubkey would also share a lease with the Bitcoin Policy Institute, a nonpartisan think tank researching the social impact of the coin. I have never seen a Washington think tank whose entrance was behind a bar. In fact, when I attended Pubkey’s VIP preview in November, I couldn’t tell that this massive bar and event space, filled with old Chesterfield sofas and layered with Armenian rugs the size of studio apartments, contained an honest-to-goodness think tank, unless you saw the glowing neon sign that said BITCOIN POLICY INSTITUTE at the very, very back of the venue.

Between me and the entrance to BPI were a hundred-plus VIP guests — elected officials, Washington power players, and staffers galore. I initially planned on taking notes of who was in attendance. I soon gave up, because there was so much other stuff to look at.

In the two hours I was at the event, I saw the following:

But the weirdest thing of all was how many people in the crowd were wearing suits.

This was exactly what Pacchia envisioned. “There are good dive bars and good hospitality in DC, for sure,” he told me later, wearing the Mario Kart bomber jacket that he’d worn in a photo with Secretary Bessent. “But the way the city operates, it’s very transient, depending on the administration: people coming and going, policymakers, staffers, the colleges and universities.” People, in other words, who could ultimately write the laws that regulate cryptocurrency like bitcoin.

The first part of that plan was to shape lawmakers’ understanding of Bitcoin, and to Pacchia, that meant bringing a curated version of Bitcoin’s oddball culture to DC: deeply nerdy protocol discussions set in a fun, affordable bar with a good burger and a secret chophouse and football and trivia and Mario Kart tournaments. But if young, broke staffers wanted to just get a post-work drink and not think about Bitcoin, other than the small sign behind the bar tracking the price of Bitcoin, that was fine too. “We wanted to cast a really wide net and just show people that the Bitcoin culture and the Bitcoin community is broadly misunderstood. We’re normal people, kind of nerdy, really into this thing. You can come here, and it’s not going to be a church.”

The advocacy part was definitely there, in the form of a giant event space behind the bar where Pubkey planned to host the evening events that make Washington run: fireside chats, summits, small conferences, and happy hours. There was even a large stage that could either be used for anything from panel discussions to live music. “DC’s more event driven,” said Pacchia, noting that the original Pubkey also hosts podcasts, panels, and get-togethers — just in a cramped Greenwich Village underground dive bar. “We wanted to combine all the different spaces that we have in New York, just with a lot more square footage to be able to host events.”

Loyal customers had been clamoring for Pubkeys in other cities, from San Francisco to Barcelona. Instead, Pubkey decided to go to a deeply partisan city where at least half of its residents loathed the concept of cryptocurrency. Sure, they had a few allies among the Democrats, such as Rep. Torres and Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY), but the majority of the party, led by Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) and Biden, are hostile. It didn’t help that Trump had visited the New York Pubkey during his 2024 presidential campaign, paying for his smashburgers in Bitcoin, and Kamala Harris didn’t. (Pacchia says that he extended invites to both the Biden and Harris campaigns, but never heard back.) And even some Republicans remain hostile: the previous restaurant had been a popular hangout for Republican staffers and the reporters who covered them, and when it closed in April, one could hear people yelling Fuck bitcoin! from the karaoke room in the basement.

The concept of Pubkey as Bitcoin cultural diplomacy that transcended partisanship — a cryptocurrency version of Barack Obama’s beer summit — does sound overly idealistic in DC, where the current political climate has exacerbated people’s tendency to separate into Republican and Democrat bars. Liberals frequently gather to protest outside Butterworth’s, a recently opened gastropub whose investors include several high-profile MAGA influencers. A recent attempt to open a bipartisan bar, Political Pattie’s, was widely mocked by Republicans and Democrats alike — so much that it closed within 75 days.

But at its core, Pubkey DC is a pro-Bitcoin interest group that happens to be inside a bar capturing those elusive yet attainable Cozy Vibes: an affordable menu, a lot of comfy couches, and enough TVs to air as many major sporting events as possible. (They are probably going to host a Super Bowl party.) And crucially, it’s edited out all the elements of a culture that would horrify politicians — the kind that would result in, say, fraudsters pulling multibillion-dollar scams while living in a Bermuda polycule, or shady actors ordering drugs and assassinations on the Silk Road, or wealthy people being kidnapped and held hostage for their crypto. (At least downtown DC is heavily policed.)

The venue already has a few high-profile cheerleaders — including Tammy Haddad, the founder of Haddad Media, whose name is synonymous with the concept of throwing huge parties and exclusive events full of Washington’s most influential people.

When I got on the phone with Haddad, she had just come from another Pubkey event, Crypto Christmas, where three leading Senators were in attendance — Cynthia Lummis, Bill Hagerty, and Tim Scott — and dozens of young Capitol Hill staffers. “Who would think Crypto Christmas would be on 7th Street?” she told The Verge in an interview. “Some people might think it would be at the Willard Hotel or the Four Seasons, but no.”

Haddad, also the founder of the Washington AI Network, compared Pubkey’s ethos to net neutrality’s grassroots approach to winning political capital. “Back then it was more astroturfing and in states. But this is right in the downtown community, not [just with] lobbyists, but everyone else that they can bring into the party. It’s an interesting idea. I would argue it’s a new kind of coalition building.”

As she viewed it, Bitcoin and crypto was now in the next stage of its yearslong plan to gain legitimacy: now that they had a handful of strong political allies in the states and inside Washington, they needed to play the long game by opening the discussion about Bitcoin’s future to anyone and everyone who could not score an invite to an exclusive event for policymakers at the Four Seasons. And, more importantly, they needed to show the political world that Bitcoin was not a coin solely defined by its extremely dark and checkered past.

“It’s not like Pubkey is just trying to sell drinks,” she said.

Spotify confirmed the incident and says it has disabled user accounts linked to it, but that won’t un-leak the music.

Spotify says it has launched new protections against “anti-copyright attacks” after the open-source library / pirate activist group Anna’s Archive announced it’s ripped 86 million songs from the platform that it plans to make available in torrents, as reported earlier by Billboard. According to the group, “We have archived around 86 million songs from Spotify, ordering by popularity descending. While this only represents 37 percent of songs, it represents around 99.6 percent of listens.”

The first torrent released says it contains metadata, such as album art, song title, and artist name, belonging to 99.9 percent of Spotify’s 256 million tracks. The group says it plans to make the 300TB worth of music files available at a later date.

Anna’s Archive, which describes itself as “the world’s largest shadow library,” says it “backed up Spotify” as part of an attempt to create a “preservation archive” for music using Spotify’s “popularity” metric to determine which tracks to download first. It says the metadata reveals information like which genre has the most tracks (Electronic/Dance, with 520,075), and that 120BPM is the most popular tempo.

Though Anna’s Archive primarily focuses on backing up books and research documents, its blog post says it “discovered a way to scrape Spotify at scale.” Last month, Google said it removed 749 million links to Anna’s Archive domains from its search engine due to copyright complaints, as reported by TorrentFreak.

In a statement to The Verge, Spotify spokesperson Laura Batey said the company “has identified and disabled the nefarious user accounts engaged in unlawful scraping.”

﻿It joins the new Birdfy Feeder Vista featuring a 360-degree 6K camera

Ahead of CES 2026 getting underway in early January, Birdfy has announced two new camera-equipped smart bird feeders that can identify and capture visitors in slow motion. The Birdfy Hum Bloom is specifically designed to attract and record hummingbirds using a nectar bulb that mimics flowers they’re naturally attracted to, while the Feeder Vista introduces a 360-degree camera and a bottom-up feeding system that doesn’t obstruct views. Both feeders are expected to be available in Q2 of 2026 but pricing hasn’t been announced.

The Birdfy Hum Bloom is built around an 8MP camera that can capture 4K video of hummingbirds at 20fps. Capturing 120fps slo-mo videos requires a drop in resolution to 1080P, but with hummingbirds flapping their wings around 50 to 80 times per second while hovering, you shouldn’t expect footage that will rival a National Geographic documentary.

The feeder is designed to hang from a tree branch or other support and features a hydraulic system to pump nectar into the feeding bulb that dangles in front of the camera so a hovering hummingbird is always perfectly framed. Sensors track nectar levels and send alerts to the Birdy mobile app when a refill is needed, while an “ant moat” above the feeder helps prevent the nectar-loving insects from swarming the feeder.

The Birdfy Feeder Vista features a pair of back-to-back cameras, similar to what you’ll find on the DJI Osmo 360 and the Insta360 X5, that can capture 14MP panoramic stills or 6K 360-degree videos at 30fps. Dropping the resolution to 2K enables slow-motion video recording at up to 120fps, and you have the option of viewing just a single camera at a time for a wide-angle view.

Unlike most smart birdfeeders that hide a gravity-powered seed dispenser behind their cameras, the Feeder Vista employs a unique air-powered piston to push seeds up into the feeder area from a sealed container below. This approach ensures the container is always out of frame in 360-degree images and videos, and it allows you to remotely control “feeding speed and portion size” using the Birdfy mobile app.

Both of the new feeders are capable of identifying and providing details about visiting birds using Birdfy’s LLM-powered OrniSense AI. While the Hum Bloom relies on traditional motion sensing to detect hummingbirds in flight, the Feeder Vista uses a new weight sensor that helps ensure only birds that land to feed are recorded. Animals, cars, or people moving through the frame are ignored. Knowing how much a bird weighs also allows the AI to estimate its size which improves its accuracy when identifying it.

            <p><strong>MIT Technology Review | 2025-12-22</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/12/22/1130153/geothermal-energy-carbon-capture-kenya-climate-solution/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The earth around Lake Naivasha, a shallow freshwater basin in south-central Kenya, does not seem to want to lie still.

Ash from nearby Mount Longonot, which erupted as recently as the 1860s, remains in the ground. Obsidian caves and jagged stone towers preside over the steam that spurts out of fissures in the soil and wafts from pools of boiling-hot water—produced by magma that, in some areas, sits just a few miles below the surface.

It’s a landscape born from violent geologic processes some 25 million years ago, when the Nubian and Somalian tectonic plates pulled apart. That rupture cut a depression in the earth some 4,000 miles long—from East Africa up through the Middle East—to create what’s now called the Great Rift Valley.

This volatility imbues the land with vast potential, much of it untapped. The area, no more than a few hours’ drive from Nairobi, is home to five geothermal power stations, which harness the clouds of steam to generate about a quarter of Kenya’s electricity. But some energy from this process escapes into the atmosphere, while even more remains underground for lack of demand.

In June, just north of the lake in the small but strategically located town of Gilgil, the startup began running a high-stakes test. It’s harnessing some of that excess energy to power four prototypes of a machine that promises to remove carbon dioxide from the air in a manner that the company says is efficient, affordable, and—crucially—scalable.

In the short term, the impact will be small—each device’s initial capacity is just 60 tons per year of CO2—but the immediate goal is simply to demonstrate that carbon removal here is possible. The longer-term vision is far more ambitious: to prove that direct air capture (DAC), as the process is known, can be a powerful tool to help the world keep temperatures from rising to ever more dangerous levels.

“We believe we are doing what we can here in Kenya to address climate change and lead the charge for positioning Kenya as a climate vanguard,” Specioser Mutheu, Octavia’s communications lead, told me when I visited the country last year.

The United Nations’ Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has stated that in order to keep the world from warming more than 1.5 °C over preindustrial levels (the threshold set out in the Paris Agreement), or even the more realistic but still difficult 2 °C, it will need to significantly reduce future fossil-fuel emissions—and also pull from the atmosphere billions of tons of carbon that have already been released.

Some argue that DAC, which uses mechanical and chemical processes to suck carbon dioxide from the air and store it in a stable form (usually underground), is the best way to do that. It’s a technology with immense promise, offering the possibility that human ingenuity and innovation can get us out of the same mess that development caused in the first place.

Last year, the world’s largest DAC plant, Mammoth, came online in Iceland, offering the eventual capacity to remove up to 36,000 tons of CO₂ per year—roughly equal to the emissions of 7,600 gas-powered cars. The idea is that DAC plants like this one will remove and permanently store carbon and create carbon credits that can be purchased by corporations, governments, and local industrial producers, which will collectively help keep the world from experiencing the most dangerous effects of climate change.

Now, Octavia and a growing number of other companies, politicians, and investors from Africa, the US, and Europe are betting that Kenya’s unique environment holds the keys to reaching this lofty goal—which is why they’re pushing a sweeping vision to remake the Great Rift Valley into the “Great Carbon Valley.” And they hope to do so in a way that provides a genuine economic boost for Kenya, while respecting the rights of the Indigenous people who live on this land. If they can do so, the project could not just give a needed jolt to the DAC industry—it could also provide proof of concept for DAC across the Global South, which is particularly vulnerable to the ravages of climate change despite bearing very little responsibility for it.

But DAC is also a controversial technology, unproven at scale and wildly expensive to operate. In May, an Icelandic news outlet published an investigation into Climeworks, which runs the Mammoth plant, finding that it didn’t even pull in enough carbon dioxide to offset its own emissions, let alone the emissions of other companies.

Critics also argue that the electricity DAC requires can be put to better use cleaning up our transportation systems, heating our homes, and powering other industries that still rely largely on fossil fuels. What’s more, they say that relying on DAC can give polluters an excuse to delay the transition to renewables indefinitely. And further complicating this picture is shrinking demand from governments and corporations that would be DAC’s main buyers, which has left some experts questioning whether the industry will even survive.

Carbon removal is a technology that seems always on the verge of kicking in but never does, says Fadhel Kaboub, a Tunisian economist and advocate for an equitable green transition. “You need billions of dollars of investment in it, and it’s not delivering, and it’s not going to deliver anytime soon. So why do we put the entire future of the planet in the hands of a few people and a technology that doesn’t deliver?”

Layered on top of concerns about the viability and wisdom of DAC is a long history of distrust from the Maasai people who have called the Great Rift Valley home for generations but have been displaced in waves by energy companies coming in to tap the land’s geothermal reserves. And many of those remaining don’t even have access to the electricity generated by these plants.

It’s an immensely complicated landscape to navigate. But if the project can indeed make it through, Benjamin Sovacool, an energy policy researcher and director of the Boston University Institute for Global Sustainability, sees immense potential for countries that have been historically marginalized from climate policy and green energy investment. Though he’s skeptical about DAC as a near-term climate solution, he says these nations could still see big benefits from what could be a multitrillion-dollar industry.

“[Of] all the technologies we have available to fight climate change, the idea of reversing it by sucking CO2 out of the air and storing it is really attractive. It’s something even an ordinary person can just get,” Sovacool says. “If we’re able to do DAC at scale, it could be the next huge energy transition.”

But first, of course, the Great Carbon Valley has to actually deliver.

The “Great Carbon Valley” is both a broad vision for the region and a company founded to shepherd that vision into reality.

Bilha Ndirangu, a 42-year-old MIT electrical engineering graduate who grew up in Nairobi, has long worried about the impacts of climate change on Kenya. But she doesn’t want the country to be a mere victim of rising temperatures, she tells me; she hopes to see it become a source of climate solutions. So in 2021, Ndirangu cofounded Jacob’s Ladder Africa, a nonprofit with the goal of preparing African workers for green industries.

She also began collaborating with the Kenyan entrepreneur James Irungu Mwangi, the CEO of Africa Climate Ventures, an investment firm focused on building and accelerating climate-smart businesses. He’d been working on an idea that spoke to their shared belief in the potential for the country’s vast geothermal capacity; the plan was to find buyers for Kenya’s extra geothermal energy in order to kick-start the development of even more renewable power. One energy-hungry, climate-positive industry stood out: direct air capture of carbon dioxide.

The Great Rift Valley was the key to this vision. The thinking was that it could provide the cheap energy needed to power affordable DAC at scale while offering an ideal geology to effectively store carbon deep underground after it was extracted from the air. And with nearly 90% of the country’s grid already powered by renewable energy, DAC wouldn’t be siphoning power away from other industries that need it. Instead, attracting DAC to Kenya could provide the boost needed for energy providers to build out their infrastructure and expand the grid—ideally connecting the roughly 25% of people in the country who lack electricity and reducing scenarios in which power has to be rationed.

“This push for renewable energy and the decarbonization of industries is providing us with a once-in-a-lifetime sort of opportunity,” Ndirangu tells me.

So in 2023, the pair founded Great Carbon Valley, a project development company whose mission is attracting DAC companies to the area, along with other energy-intensive industries looking for renewable power.

It has already brought on high-profile companies like the Belgian DAC startup Sirona Technologies, the French DAC company Yama, and Climeworks, the Swiss company that operates Mammoth and another DAC plant in Iceland (and was on MIT Technology Review’s 10 Breakthrough Technologies list in 2022, and the list of Climate Tech Companies to Watch in 2023). All are planning on launching pilot projects in Kenya in the coming years, with Climeworks announcing plans to complete its Kenyan DAC plant by 2028. GCV has also partnered with Cella, an American carbon-storage company that works with Octavia, and is facilitating permits for the Icelandic company Carbfix, which injects the carbon from Climeworks’ DAC facilities.

“Climate change is disproportionately impacting this part of the world, but it’s also changing the rules of the game all over the world,” Cella CEO and cofounder Corey Pattison tells me, explaining the draw of Mwangi and Ndirangu’s concept. “This is also an opportunity to be entrepreneurial and creative in our thinking, because there are all of these assets that places like Kenya have.”

Not only can the country offer cheap and abundant renewable energy, but supporters of Kenyan DAC hope that the young and educated local workforce can supply the engineers and scientists needed to build out this infrastructure. In turn, the business could open opportunities to the country’s roughly 6 million un- or under-employed youths.

“It’s not a one-off industry,” Ndirangu says, highlighting her faith in the idea that jobs will flow from green industrialization. Engineers will be needed to monitor the DAC facilities, and the additional demand for renewable power will create jobs in the energy sector, along with related services like water and hospitality.

“You’re developing a whole range of infrastructure to make this industry possible,” she adds. “That infrastructure is not just good for the industry—it’s also just good for the country.”

In June of last year, I walked up a dirt path to the HQ of Octavia Carbon, just off Nairobi’s Eastern Bypass Road, on the far outskirts of the city.

The staffers I met on my tour exuded the kind of boundless optimism that’s common in early-stage startups. “People used to write academic articles about the fact that no human will ever be able to run a marathon in less than two hours,” Octavia CEO Martin Freimüller told me that day. The Kenyan marathon runner Eliud Kipchoge broke that barrier in a race in 2019. A mural of him features prominently on the wall, along with the athlete’s slogan, “No human is limited.”

“It’s impossible, until Kenya does it,” Freimüller added.

Although not an official partner of Ndirangu’s Great Carbon Valley venture, Octavia aligns with the larger vision, he told me. The company got its start in 2022, when Freimüller, an Austrian development consultant, met Duncan Kariuki, an engineering graduate from the University of Nairobi, in the OpenAir Collective, an online forum devoted to carbon removal. Kariuki introduced Freimüller to his classmates Fiona Mugambi and Mike Bwondera, and the four began working on a DAC prototype, first in lab space borrowed from the university and later in an apartment. It didn’t take long for neighbors to complain about the noise, and within six months, the operation had moved to its current warehouse.

That same year, they announced their first prototype, affectionately called Thursday after the day it was unveiled at a Nairobi Climate Network event. Soon, Octavia was showing off its tech to high-profile visitors including King Charles III and President Joe Biden’s ambassador to Kenya, Meg Whitman.

Three years later, the team has more than 40 engineers and has built its 12th DAC unit: a metal cylinder about the size of a large washing machine, containing a chemical filter using an amine, an organic compound derived from ammonia. (Octavia declined to provide further details about the arrangement of the filter inside the machine because the company is awaiting approval of a patent for the design.)

Hannah Wanjau, an engineer at the company, explained how it works: Fans draw air from the outside across the filter, causing carbon dioxide (which is acidic) to react with the basic amine and form a carbonate salt. When that mixture is heated inside a vacuum to 80 to 100 °C, the CO2 is released, now as a gas, and collected in a special chamber, while the amine can be reused for the next round of carbon capture.

The amine absorption method has been used in other DAC plants around the world, including those operated by Climeworks, but Octavia’s project stands apart on several key fronts. Wanjau explained that its technology is tailored to suit the local climate; the company has adjusted the length of time for absorption and the temperature for CO2 release, making it a potential model for other countries in the tropics.

And then there’s its energy source: The device operates on more than 80% thermal energy, which in the field will consist of the extra geothermal energy that the power plants don’t convert into electricity. This energy is typically released into the atmosphere, but it will be channeled instead to Octavia’s machines. What’s more, the device’s modular design can fit inside a shipping container, allowing the company to easily deploy dozens of these units once the demand is there, Mutheu told me.

This technology is being tested in the field in Gilgil, where Mutheu told me the company is “continuing to capture and condition CO₂ as part of our ongoing operations and testing cycles.” (She declined to provide specific data or results at this stage.)

Once the CO2 is captured, it will be heated and pressurized. Then it will be pumped to a nearby storage facility operated by Cella, where the company will inject the gas into fissures underground. The region’s special geology again offers an advantage: Much of the rock found underground here is basalt, a volcanic mineral that contains high concentrations of calcium and magnesium ions. They react with carbon dioxide to form substances like calcite, dolomite, and magnesite, locking the carbon atoms away in the form of solid minerals.

This process is more durable than other forms of carbon storage, making it potentially more attractive to buyers of carbon credits, says Pattison, the Cella CEO. Non-geologic carbon mitigation methods, such as cookstove replacement programs or nature-based solutions like tree planting, have recently been rocked by revelations of fraud or exaggeration. The money for Cella’s pilot, which will see the injection of 200 tons of CO2 this year, has come mainly from the Frontier advance market commitment, under which a group of companies including Stripe, Google, Shopify, Meta, and others has collectively pledged to spend $1 billion on carbon removal by 2030.

These projects have already opened up possibilities for young Kenyans like Wanjau. She told me there were not a lot of opportunities for aspiring mechanical engineers like her to design and test their own devices; many of her classmates were working for construction or oil companies, or were unemployed. But almost immediately after graduation, Wanjau began working for Octavia.

“I’m happy that I’m trying to solve a problem that’s a real-world issue,” she told me. “Not many people in Africa get a chance to do that.”

Despite the vast enthusiasm from partners and investors, the Great Carbon Valley faces multiple challenges before Ndirangu and Mwangi’s vision can be fully realized.

Since its start, the venture has had to contend with “this perception that doing projects in Africa is risky,” says Ndirangu. Of the dozens of DAC facilities planned or in existence today, only a handful are in the Global South. Indeed, Octavia has described itself as the first DAC plant to be located there. “Even just selling Kenya as a destination for DAC was quite a challenge,” she says.

So Ndirangu played up Kenya’s experience developing geothermal resources, as well as local engineering talent and a lower cost of labor. GCV has also offered to work with the Kenyan government to help companies secure the proper permits to break ground as soon as possible.

Ndirangu says that she’s already seen “a real appetite” from power producers who want to build out more renewable-energy infrastructure, but at the same time they’re waiting for proof of demand. She envisions that once that power is in place, lots of other industries—from data centers to producers of green steel, green ammonia, and sustainable aviation fuels—will consider basing themselves in Kenya, attracting more than a dozen projects to the valley in the next few years.

But recent events could dampen demand (which some experts already worried was insufficient). Global governments are retreating from climate action, particularly in the US. The Trump administration has dramatically slashed funding for development related to climate change and renewable energy. The Department of Energy appears poised to terminate a $50 million grant to a proposed Louisiana DAC plant that would have been partially operated by Climeworks, and in May, not long after that announcement, the company said it was cutting 22% of its staff.

At the same time, many companies that would have likely been purchasers of carbon credits—and that a few years ago had voluntarily pledged to reduce or eliminate their carbon emissions—are quietly walking back their commitments. Over the long term, experts warn, there are limits to the amount of carbon removal that companies will ever voluntarily buy. They argue that governments will ultimately have to pay for it—or require polluters to do so.

Further compounding all these challenges are costs. Critics say DAC investments are a waste of time and money compared with other forms of carbon drawdown. As of mid-December, carbon removal credits in the European Union’s Emissions Trading System, one of the world’s largest carbon markets, were priced at around $84 per ton. The average price per DAC credit, for comparison, is nearly $450. Natural processes like reforestation absorb millions of tons of carbon annually and are far cheaper (though programs to harness them for carbon credits are beset with their own controversies). Ultimately, DAC continues to operate on a small scale, removing only about 10,000 metric tons of CO2 each year.

Even if DAC suppliers do manage to push past these obstacles, there are still thorny questions coming from inside Kenya. Groups like Power Shift Africa, a Nairobi-based think tank that advocates for climate action on the continent, have derided carbon credits as “pollution permits” and blamed them for delaying the move toward electrification.

“The ultimate goal of [carbon removal] is that you can say at the end, well, we can actually continue our emissions and just recapture them with this technology,” says Kaboub, the Tunisian economist, who has worked with Power Shift Africa. “So there&#39;s no need to end fossil fuels, which is why you get a lot of support from oil countries and companies.”

Another problem he sees is not limited to DAC but extends to the way that Kenya and other African nations are pursuing their goal of green industrialization. While Kenyan President William Ruto has courted international financial investment to turn Kenya into a green energy hub, his administration’s policies have deepened the country’s external debt, which in 2024 was equal to around 30% of its GDP. Geothermal energy development in Kenya has often been financed by loans from international institutions or other governments. As its debt has risen, the country has enacted national austerity measures that have sparked deadly protests.

Kenya may indeed have advantages over other countries, and DAC costs will most likely go down eventually. But some experts, such as Boston University’s Sovacool, aren’t quite sold on the idea that the Great Carbon Valley—or any DAC venture—can significantly mitigate climate change. Sovacool’s research has found that at best, DAC will be ready to deploy on the necessary scale by midcentury, much too late to make it a viable climate solution. And that’s if it can overcome additional costs—such as the losses associated with corruption in the energy sector, which Sovacool and others have found is a widespread problem in Kenya.

Nevertheless, others within the carbon removal industry remain more optimistic about DAC’s overall prospects and are particularly hopeful that Kenya can address some of the challenges the technology has encountered elsewhere. Cost is “not the most important thing,” says Erin Burns, executive director of Carbon180, a nonprofit that advocates for the removal and reuse of carbon dioxide. “There’s lots of things we pay for.” She notes that governments in Japan, Singapore, Canada, Australia, the European Union, and elsewhere are all looking at developing compliance markets for carbon, even though the US is stagnating on this front.

The Great Carbon Valley, she believes, stands poised to benefit from these developments. “It’s big. It’s visionary,” Burns says. “You’ve got to have some ambition here. This isn’t something that is like deploying a technology that’s widely deployed already. And that comes with an enormous potential for huge opportunity, huge gains.”

More than any external factor, the Great Carbon Valley’s future is perhaps most intimately intertwined with the restless earth on which it’s being built, and the community that has lived here for centuries.

To the Maasai people, nomadic pastoralists who inhabit swathes of Eastern Africa, including Kenya, this land around Lake Naivasha is “ol-karia,” meaning “ochre,” after the bright red clay found in abundance.

South of the lake is Hell’s Gate National Park, a 26-square-mile nature reserve where the region’s five geothermal power complexes—with a sixth under construction—churn on top of the numerous steam vents. The first geothermal power plant here was brought into service in 1981 by KenGen, a majority-state-owned electricity company; it was named Olkaria.

But for decades most of the Maasai haven’t had access to that electricity. And many of them have been forced off the land in a wave of evictions. In 2014, construction on a KenGen geothermal complex expelled more than 2,000 people and led to a number of legal complaints. At the same time, locals living near a different, privately owned geothermal complex 50 miles north of Naivasha have complained of noise and air pollution; in March, a Kenyan court revoked the operating license of one of the project’s three plants.

Neither Octavia or Cella is powered by output from these two geothermal producers, but activists have warned that similar environmental and social harms could resurface if demand for new geothermal infrastructure grows in Kenya—demand that could be driven by DAC.

Ndirangu says she believes some of the complaints about displacement are “exaggerated,” but she nonetheless acknowledges the need for stronger community engagement, as does Octavia. In the long term, Ndirangu says, she plans to provide job training to residents living near the affected areas and integrate them into the industry, although she also says those plans need to be realistic. “You don’t want to create the wrong expectation that you will hire everyone from the community,” she says.

That’s part of the problem for Maasai activists like Agnes Koilel, a teacher living near the Olkaria geothermal field. Despite past promises of employment at the power plants, the jobs that are offered are lower-paying positions in cleaning or security. “Maasai people are not [as] employed as they think,” she says.

DAC is a small industry, and it can’t do everything. But if it’s going to become as big as Ndirangu, Freimüller, and other proponents of the Great Carbon Valley hope it will be, creating jobs and driving Kenya’s green industrialization, communities like Koilel’s will be among those most directly affected—much as they are by climate change.

When I asked Koilel what she thought about DAC development near her home, she told me she had never heard of the Great Carbon Valley idea, or of carbon removal in general. She wasn’t necessarily against geothermal power development on principle, or opposed to any of the industries that might push it to expand. She just wants to see some benefits, like a health center for her community. She wants to reverse the evictions that have pushed her neighbors off their land. And she wants electricity—the same kind that would power the fans and pumps of future DAC hubs.

Power “is generated from these communities,” Koilel said. “But they themselves do not have that light.”

            <h2>This company is developing gene therapies for muscle growth, erectile dysfunction, and “radical longevity”</h2>
            <p><strong>MIT Technology Review | 2025-12-22</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/12/22/1130288/gene-therapies-muscle-growth-erectile-dysfunction-radical-longevity/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">At some point next month, a handful of volunteers will be injected with two experimental gene therapies as part of an unusual clinical trial. The drugs are potential longevity therapies, says Ivan Morgunov, the CEO of Unlimited Bio, the company behind the trial. His long-term goal: to achieve radical human life extension.

The 12 to 15 volunteers—who will be covering their own travel and treatment costs—will receive a series of injections in the muscles of their arms and legs. One of the therapies is designed to increase the blood supply to those muscles. The other is designed to support muscle growth. The company hopes to see improvements in strength, endurance, and recovery. It also plans to eventually trial similar therapies in the scalp (for baldness) and penis (for erectile dysfunction).

But some experts are concerned that the trial involves giving multiple gene therapies to small numbers of healthy people. It will be impossible to draw firm conclusions from such a small study, and the trial certainly won’t reveal anything about longevity, says Holly Fernandez Lynch, a lawyer and medical ethicist at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia.

Unlimited Bio’s muscle growth therapy is already accessible at clinics in Honduras and Mexico, says Morgunov—and the company is already getting some publicity. Khloe Kardashian tagged Unlimited Bio in a Facebook post about stem-cell treatments she and her sister Kim had received at the Eterna clinic in Mexico in August. And earlier this week, the biohacking influencer Dave Asprey posted an Instagram Reel of himself receiving one of the treatments in Mexico; it was shared with 1.3 million Instagram followers. In the video, Eterna’s CEO, Adeel Khan, says that the therapy can “help with vascular health systemically.” “I’m just upgrading my system for a little while to reduce my age and reduce my vascular risk,” Asprey said.

Gene therapies typically work by introducing new genetic code into the body’s cells. This code is then able to make proteins. Existing approved gene therapies have typically been developed for severe diseases in which the target proteins are either missing or mutated.

But several groups are exploring gene therapies for healthy people. One of these companies is Minicircle, which developed a gene therapy to increase production of follistatin, a protein found throughout the body that has many roles and is involved in muscle growth. The company says this treatment will increase muscle mass—and help people live longer. Minicircle is based in Próspera, a special economic zone in Honduras with its own bespoke regulatory system. Anyone can visit the local clinic and receive that therapy, for a reported price of $25,000. And many have, including the wealthy longevity influencer Bryan Johnson, who promoted the therapy in a Netflix documentary.

Unlimited Bio’s Morgunov, a Russian-Israeli computer scientist, was inspired by Minicircle’s story. He is also interested in longevity. Specifically, he’s committed to radical life extension and has said that he could be part of “the last generation throughout human history to die from old age.” He believes the biggest “bottleneck” slowing progress toward anti-aging or lifespan-extending therapies is drug regulation. So he, too, incorporated his own biotech company in Próspera.

“A company like ours couldn’t exist outside of Próspera,” says Unlimited Bio’s chief operating officer, Vladimir Leshko.

There, Morgunov and his colleagues are exploring two gene therapies. One of these is another follistatin therapy, which the team hopes will increase muscle mass. The other codes for a protein called vascular endothelial growth factor, or VEGF. This compound is known to encourage the growth of blood vessels. Morgunov and his colleagues hope the result will be increased muscle growth, enhanced muscle repair, and longer life. Neither treatment is designed to alter a recipient’s DNA, and therefore it won’t be inherited by future generations.

The combination of the two therapies could benefit healthy people and potentially help them live longer, says Leshko, a former electrical engineer and professional poker player who retrained in biomedical engineering. “We would say that it’s a preventive-slash-enhancing indication,” he says. “Potentially participants can experience faster recovery from exercise, more strength, and more endurance.”

Of the 12 to 15 volunteers who participate in the trial, half will receive only the VEGF therapy. The other half will receive both the VEGF and the follistatin therapies. The treatments will involve a series of injections throughout large muscles in the arms and legs, says Morgunov.

He is confident that the VEGF therapy is safe. It was approved in Russia over a decade ago to treat lower-limb ischemia—a condition that can cause pain, numbness, and painful ulcers in the legs and feet. Morgunov reckons that around 10,000 people in Russia have already had the drug, although he says he hasn’t “done deep fact-checking on that.”

VEGF is a powerful compound, says Seppo Ylä-Herttuala, a professor of molecular medicine at the University of Eastern Finland who has been studying VEGF and potential VEGF therapies for decades. He doesn’t know how many people have had VEGF gene therapy in Russia. But he does know that the safety of the therapy will depend on how much is administered and where. Previous attempts to inject the therapy into the heart, for example, have resulted in edema, a sometimes fatal buildup of fluid. Even if the therapy is injected elsewhere, VEGF can travel around the body, he says. If it gets to the eye, for example, it could cause blindness. Leshko counters that the VEGF should remain where it is injected, and any other circulation in the body, if it occurs, should be short-lived.

And while the therapy has been approved in Russia, there’s a reason it hasn’t been approved elsewhere, says Ylä-Herttuala: The clinical trials were not as rigorous as they could have been. While “it probably works in some patients,” he says, the evidence to support the use of this therapy is weak. At any rate, he adds, VEGF will only support the growth of blood vessels—it won’t tackle aging.  “VEGF is not a longevity drug,” he says.

Leshko points to a 2021 study in mice, which suggested that a lack of VEGF activity might drive aging in the rodents. “We’re convinced it qualifies as a potential longevity drug,” he says.

There is even less data about follistatin. Minicircle, the company selling another follistatin gene therapy, has not published any rigorous clinical trial data. So far, much of the evidence for follistatin’s effects comes from research in rodents, says Ylä-Herttuala.

Clinical trials like this one should gather more information, both about the therapies and about the methods used to get those therapies into the body. Unlimited Bio’s VEGF therapy will be delivered via a circular piece of genetic code called a plasmid. Its follistatin therapy, on the other hand, will be delivered via an adeno-associated virus (AAV). Plasmid therapies are easier to make, and they have a shorter lifespan in the body—only a matter of days. They are generally considered to be safer than AAV therapies. AAV therapies, on the other hand, tend to stick around for months, says Ylä-Herttuala. And they can trigger potentially dangerous immune reactions.

It’s debatable whether healthy people should be exposed to these risks, says Fernandez Lynch. The technology “still has serious questions about its safety and effectiveness,” even for people with life-threatening diseases, she says. “If you are a healthy person, the risk of harm is more substantial because it’ll be more impactful on your life.”

But Leshko is adamant. “Over 120,000 humans die DAILY from age-related causes,” he wrote in an email. “Building ‘ethical’ barriers around ‘healthy’ human (in fact, aging human) trials is unethical.” Morgunov did not respond to a request for comment.

Some people want to take those risks anyway. In his video, the biohacker influencer Asprey—who has publicly stated that he’s “going to live to 180”—described VEGF as a “longevity compound,” and Eterna’s CEO Khan, who delivered the treatment, described it as “the ultimate upgrade.” Neither Asprey nor Khan clinic responded to requests for comment.

Michael Gusmano, a professor of health policy at Lehigh University in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, worries that this messaging might give trial participants unrealistic expectations about how they might benefit. There is “huge potential for therapeutic misconception when you have some kind of celebrity online influencer touting something about which there is relatively sparse scientific evidence,” he says. In reality, he adds, “the only thing you can guarantee is that [the volunteers] will be contributing to our knowledge of how this intervention works.”

“I would certainly not recommend that anyone I know enter into such a trial,” says Gusmano.

The muscle study is only the first step. The Unlimited Bio team hopes to trial the VEGF therapy for baldness and erectile dysfunction, too. Leshko points to research in mice that links high VEGF levels to larger, denser hair follicles. He hopes to test a series of VEGF therapy injections into the scalps of volunteers. Morgunov, who is largely bald, has already started to self-experiment with the approach.

An erectile dysfunction trial may follow. “That one we think has great potential because injecting gene therapy into the penis sounds exciting,” says Leshko. A protocol for that trial has not yet been finalized, but he imagines it would involve “five to 10” injections.

Ylä-Herttuala isn’t optimistic about either approach. Hair growth is largely hormonal, he says. And injecting anything into a penis risks damaging it (although Leshko points out that a similar approach was taken by another company almost 20 years ago). Injecting a VEGF gene therapy into the penis would also risk edema there, Ylä-Herttuala adds.

And he points out that we already have some treatments for hair loss and erectile dysfunction. While they aren’t perfect, their existence does raise the bar for any potential future therapies—not only do they have to be safe and effective, but they must be safer or more effective than existing ones.

That doesn’t mean the trials will flop. No small trial can be definitive, but it could still provide some insight into how these drugs are working. It is possible that the therapies will increase muscle mass, at least, and that this could be beneficial to the healthy recipients, says Ylä-Herttuala.

Before our call, he had taken a look at Unlimited Bio’s website, which carries the tagline “The Most Advanced Rejuvenation Solution.” “They promise a lot,” he said. “I hope it’s true.”

China figured out how to sell EVs. Now it has to bury their batteries.

In the past decade, China has seen an EV boom, thanks in part to government support. Buying an electric car has gone from a novel decision to a routine one; by late 2025, nearly 60% of new cars sold were electric or plug-in hybrids.But as the batteries in China’s first wave of EVs reach the end of their useful life, early owners are starting to retire their cars, and the country is now under pressure to figure out what to do with those aging components.The issue is putting strain on China’s still-developing battery recycling industry and has given rise to a gray market that often cuts corners on safety and environmental standards. National regulators and commercial players are also stepping in, but so far these efforts have struggled to keep pace with the flood of batteries coming off the road.

It’s a weird time to be an AI doomer.This small but influential community believes, in the simplest terms, that AI could get so good it could be bad—very, very bad—for humanity.The doomer crowd has had some notable success over the past several years: including helping shape AI policy coming from the Biden administration. But a number of developments over the past six months have put them on the back foot. Talk of an AI bubble has overwhelmed the discourse as tech companies continue to invest in multiple Manhattan Projects’ worth of data centers without any certainty that future demand will match what they’re building.So where does this leave the doomers? We decided to ask some of the movement’s biggest names to see if the recent setbacks and general vibe shift had altered their views. See what they had to say in our story.—Garrison Lovely

Synthesia’s AI clones are more expressive than ever. Soon they’ll be able to talk back.

Earlier this summer, I visited the AI company Synthesia to create a hyperrealistic AI-generated avatar of me. The company’s avatars are a decent barometer of just how dizzying progress has been in AI over the past few years, so I was curious just how accurately its latest AI model, introduced last month, could replicate me.I found my avatar as unnerving as it is technically impressive. It’s slick enough to pass as a high-definition recording of a chirpy corporate speech, and if you didn’t know me, you’d probably think that’s exactly what it was.My avatar shows how it’s becoming ever-harder to distinguish the artificial from the real. And before long, these avatars will even be able to talk back to us. But how much better can they get? And what might interacting with AI clones do to us? Read the full story.

            <div id="article-text">Most engineering leaders cannot answer the one question their CFO is about to ask: “Can you prove this AI spend is changing outcomes, not just activity?”

Every December, roadmaps get locked, budgets get approved, and board decks are polished until everything looks precise and under control. Underneath, many CTOs and VPs are still working with partial visibility. They have a feel for their teams, but not a reliable view of how work moves through the system, how AI is really changing delivery, or where time and money actually go.

For a while, that was survivable. Experience, pattern recognition, and cheap capital covered the gaps. You could hire around bottlenecks, overstaff critical teams, or quietly pivot away from the messiest parts of the system. Then AI showed up and became the perfect distraction. Pilots, PoCs, Copilot seats, and “AI initiatives” created visible activity and bought time.

In 2026, that grace period ends. Boards and CFOs are shifting from “show me you are experimenting” to “show me measurable impact, this year.” Not because they stopped believing in AI, but because the market no longer rewards vague promises. Every AI dollar will need a traceable path to productivity, quality, or customer value.

TNW City Coworking space - Where your best work happens

A workspace designed for growth, collaboration, and endless networking opportunities in the heart of tech.

If you run engineering, you probably recognise this scene. You present a slide with AI highlights. Adoption is up. Developers say they like the tools. You share a few anecdotes about faster coding and smoother reviews. Then the CFO asks a simple question: “Exactly how is this budget changing output and outcomes?”

What is almost always missing is a clear breakdown of:

So the conversation slips back to learning curves, compounding benefits, and talent attraction. All true, but too soft for a tough budget review. That will not be enough.

AI vendors love task-level numbers. A coding task completed 55 percent faster looks impressive on a slide. But once you zoom out to teams and systems, the picture changes.

Large datasets across thousands of developers show a consistent pattern:

The problem is not the tools. It is the lack of a system for where the “extra” capacity goes.

Most organisations still frame AI productivity in terms of speed: more story points, more tickets, higher deployment frequency. That misses the bigger question:

How much of our engineering capacity goes to net new value versus maintenance, incidents, and rework, and is AI improving that mix?

High-level benchmarks are blunt but helpful. On average, about 45 percent of developer time is spent on maintenance, minor enhancements, and bug fixes rather than on genuinely new, customer-facing work. If AI helps you produce more code inside an unchanged system, you risk:

That is how you end up with impressive local metrics and a leadership team that still feels like engineering is slowing down.

If you want to walk into a 2026 budget conversation with objective evidence, you need to be deliberate about how AI-driven time savings are used. Two moves matter.

AI is already good at boilerplate, tests, documentation, and simple refactors. The trap is treating the saved time as unstructured “extra” capacity that disappears into the noise. Instead:

When teams systematically reduce technical debt and improve tests around critical flows, they cut future incidents and rework. Over a year, that frees more capacity for new work than shaving a few minutes off each ticket ever will.

2. Point AI at the ugly, high-friction work that commonly blows up roadmaps

The biggest productivity wins are not in everyday code generation. They are in:

These activities steal weeks or months of capacity and stall strategic initiatives. Using AI to understand legacy code faster, propose refactoring plans, generate migration scaffolding, and highlight recurring failure patterns can dramatically compress timelines for this work.

In parallel, there is real leverage upstream in the problem space. Teams that reach higher levels of AI adoption report better gains when they:

That reduces wasted builds and focuses effort on changes customers actually care about. The most significant gains do not come from replacing human creativity, but from amplifying it and aiming it at better-defined problems.

DORA metrics are not the enemy. Deployment frequency, lead time, MTTR, and change failure rate remain among the best signals we have for delivery performance. The risk is mistaking them for the whole picture.

Leading organisations are already expanding their scorecard to include:

In 2026, the question in the boardroom will shift from “Are we elite on DORA?” to “How much of our capacity is going into things customers notice, and is AI improving that mix or not?” To answer that cleanly, DORA is necessary but not sufficient. You need a way to connect AI usage, workflow, quality, and business outcomes across the system.

This is where engineering intelligence platforms move from a nice-to-have to mandatory. The organisations that win in 2026 will not do it with one more AI tool or one more disconnected dashboard. They will do it by pulling together data they already have but rarely use in one coherent view:

From there, leaders can answer the questions that actually matter:

Instead of defending AI spend with anecdotes, you walk in with:

That is the difference between “we believe in AI” and “here is how AI changed our delivery engine in measurable ways.”

To be ready for the more complex questions coming next year, use this planning cycle to do four things.

Do this, and you will not just have “AI activity” to show in 2026. You will have a credible, data-backed story from AI spend to business outcomes.

The leaders who thrive next year will not be the ones with the flashiest AI demos or the loudest “AI strategy” slide. They will be the ones who:

Engineering intelligence platforms is a key part of that shift. They give you the complex data to show where time and money go, how AI is really changing delivery, and whether your current pace is sustainable. The shift to data-backed engineering leadership is happening either way.

The gap in 2026 will be between teams still guessing and teams that can prove, in detail, how their engineering organisation works.

            <div id="article-text">Not long ago, like many of you, I read what I feared might be The Next Web’s final article. In late September, TNW’s co-founder announced that the tech conference and news site would be winding down, no more events, no new stories. It felt like the end of an era; the news hit hard!

Yet, just a few weeks ago, a twist arrived: the tech platform Tekpon acquired 100% of TNW’s media and events brand from the Financial Times, ensuring that this nearly two-decade legacy will continue to thrive.

While, myself, trying to read people’s opinions on this topic, I read this comment in one article, from one former TNW editor-in-chief that said: “The Next Web shaped my career, my life… it’s very sad to see it die”.

The latest rumblings from the EU tech scene, a story from our wise ol&#39; founder Boris, and some questionable AI art. It&#39;s free, every week, in your inbox. Sign up now!

I asked myself: Why do we always assume that just because one chapter ends, the whole story is over? Yes, taking over TNW is a heavy inheritance, especially with all eyes on us and expectations sky-high.

And I’ll admit, doubts crept in: Am I too small for this? Could someone more experienced do it better? Probably. But here I am, stepping up regardless. Because this isn’t just another blog or brand; TNW is a living ecosystem, a vital community. Its story deserves to continue, and I’m determined to help write the next chapter.

I also know some of you might be wondering: Who is she? What does she know? How many articles has she written? What recommends her?

Before reading all sorts of titles and, let me briefly introduce myself.

I’ve been writing since high school, with thousands of articles under my belt; covering everything from culture, art, and hip hop to design, politics, history, and food. I landed my first content writer job at 18, and alongside writing I pursued another passion: becoming a chef.

(Fun fact: I even made it to the semifinals of MasterChef, a journey that taught me about creativity under pressure and staying cool when the heat is on.)

Now, I channel my storytelling skills into helping businesses better understand technology and use it to their advantage. I help companies tell their stories, the real ones, finding meaning and flow in every word.

Over the years, I’ve specialized in blending creative storytelling with the technical precision of a chef’s knife. (My colleagues at Tekpon might say I can be as sharp as that knife – true to my values and quick to cut through the nonsense.) I am also the “No, we have to do it right” person in the team.

I’ve reviewed countless software products, interviewed founders, and explored how digital innovation can be a force for good in society. Or not. In other words, I’ve always cared about the why behind the tech, the real impact on people’s lives, not just the buzz. That perspective will be behind every story we will publish at TNW.

If there’s a place for those who still think stories written by humans matter, tell me where it is. I’m already on my way.

I’m not here to change TNW’s DNA; I’m here to reinforce it with fresh energy and a clear vision for the future.

To the loyal TNW readers, to the startup founders who looked to us for inspiration, to the healthy tech skeptics who counted on us for a reality check, and to our global audience spread across continents: we hear you.

We all know the world of tech news has changed dramatically. Today, everyone has a megaphone, social media overflows with hot takes, and AI algorithms can crank out content in seconds. It’s easy to feel overwhelmed by this sea of opinions and auto-generated articles. In such a world, the role of a publication like TNW is more critical than ever: to be a filter, not just another firehose of content.

We will focus on curation and clarity, distilling the noise so you don’t have to.

Here’s the good news: despite the deluge of AI-written text out there, readers are actively looking for authentic, human journalism. Every article we will publish will be created by a human writer who is accountable for the facts and who brings context, analysis, and yes, a bit of personality too.

Our mission isn’t to chase every trending headline algorithmically; it’s to help you understand which innovations actually matter, and why.

If a story is everywhere but lacks substance, we won’t regurgitate it; we’ll analyze it or debunk it. If a breakthrough is genuinely promising, we’ll explain why it’s important and how it impacts real people. Being a thoughtful filter in this age of information overload (and AI-generated noise) isn’t just a catchy slogan for us; it’s a responsibility we embrace.

You’ll also notice something different in our approach: an emphasis on storytelling and the human side of tech. Technology doesn’t exist in a vacuum; it’s built and used by people with dreams, dilemmas, and diverse backgrounds.

I believe, and I suspect many of you do too, that the best tech journalism zooms out from the gadgets and code to highlight those human stories. Practically speaking, expect to see more features, interviews, and narrative-driven pieces on TNW.

We’ll talk to founders about the messy, human journey of building a startup, not just the press releases or funding announcements. We’ll spotlight the engineers, designers, and thinkers who are trying to solve big problems (or even small ones that make a big difference). We’ll explore tech’s impact on society: the good, the bad, and the complicated.

This won’t be a place for recycled press releases or surface-level takes. It will be a place for conversation and insight.

Importantly, none of this focus on storytelling means we’ll skimp on rigor. Being engaging doesn’t mean sacrificing accuracy or depth. My team will continue to prioritize thorough research and fact-checking, those good old-school journalism values, even as we experiment with new formats and new voices. In short, we won’t publish anything we wouldn’t want to read ourselves.

Today, looking forward means acknowledging that how we cover tech is as important as what we cover. It means committing to journalism that cuts through the clutter, to storytelling that puts people first, and to a vision of tech’s future that is both hopeful and honest. That’s my vision for TNW as I step into this role, and I hope it resonates with you.

Now, I’d like to turn it over to you, our community. This is your TNW as much as it is ours. I invite you to join the conversation. Tell us what you want to see more of (or less of). Hold us accountable,if we ever fall short, let us know. Share your stories and perspectives with us, because they can inspire our coverage.

In the coming weeks, you’ll start to see this vision take shape on the site. You’ll see familiar faces and new voices. You’ll find articles that make you think, others that make you smile, and hopefully quite a few that make you proud to be a TNW reader.

Whether you’re a long-time follower who’s stuck with us through thick and thin, a startup founder looking for insight, a skeptic keeping us honest, or a curious mind tuning in from anywhere in the world – thank you. We do this for you, and we couldn’t do it without you.

The Next Web is back. We’re here to inform you, inspire you, challenge you, and occasionally even surprise you. I’m honored to have you with us on this journey. Here’s to the road ahead, to storytelling, to journalism (the real kind), and to making sense of the future together.

Thank you for reading, and welcome to TNW’s next chapter. Let’s build it, day by day, story by story, together.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">When OpenAI announced its new shopping search capabilities, I took the news with a grain of salt (perhaps the whole shaker).
For the past decade, we have watched the slow evolution of traditional search engines. What began as tools for pure information discovery gradually morphed into ecosystems dominated by SEO-optimized content and sponsored results. My initial fear with ChatGPT’s update was simple: Are we seeing the beginning of a similar shift? Is the purity of the “reasoning engine” being diluted by the necessity of commerce?
After testing the new shopping integration, the results suggest that we are at a pivotal moment in the user experience of Generative AI, one that requires an open discussion about what we actually want these tools to be.

The defining characteristic of Large Language Models (LLMs) is their ability to handle nuance. When we interact with ChatGPT, we expect a Socratic dialogue. We expect the AI to ask clarifying questions to narrow down our intent.
To test this, I entered a simple prompt: “I want to buy a vacuum.”
I anticipated a conversation, questions about my home’s square footage, my floor type, or my budget. Instead, the conversational nuance was replaced by a display that felt familiar: a grid of product photos, names, prices, and direct links to retailers.

While efficient, this experience felt like a regression. It mirrored the “keyword search” experience of Web 2.0 rather than the “intent-based” promise of GenAI. It replied to my prompt, but it stripped away the intelligence.

TNW City Coworking space - Where your best work happens

A workspace designed for growth, collaboration, and endless networking opportunities in the heart of tech.

Scrolling down, I engaged with the new feature in a call to action: “Research the best vacuums.”
This is where the user experience (UX) friction became most apparent. Rather than synthesizing data or comparing technical specifications in a chat format, the tool presented a polling interface designed to filter results.

The experience is oddly time-sensitive; pause too long to think or drink water, and the screens will skip forward, dumping you back into a list of product cards.
The interface presents products with a binary choice: “More like this” or “Not interested.” It offers brand names and price tags, but virtually no information to help the user actually make a choice.

For a user seeking genuine research, being presented with a list of brands and prices without deep comparative analysis feels like a missed opportunity.
It raises a question: If I wanted to filter products by price and brand, wouldn’t I use a traditional retailer? The value proposition of Gen AI should be synthesis, not just aggregation.

The Tension Between Reasoning and Revenue
This update highlights the inevitable tension facing major AI companies: the balance between user utility and business sustainability.
As OpenAI scales, the pressure to demonstrate revenue models to investors is natural. However, there is a risk in prioritizing transactional features before the core product, reasoning and logic, is fully matured. By introducing a shopping experience that feels closer to a “click-through” engine than a “knowledge” engine, the platform risks blurring its own identity.
Is ChatGPT a research partner that helps me think? Or is it a shopping assistant trying to speed me to checkout?

To be clear, I believe there is a place for shopping within AI. But the execution matters.
A truly Generative AI shopping experience shouldn’t just list products; it should understand the user. It should read between the lines of a prompt to understand that a user asking for a vacuum might actually be solving a problem about pet hair or allergies.

The current iteration feels like a beta test of a business model rather than an evolution of intelligence. As we move forward, the hope is that OpenAI will refine this tool to prioritize the “Chat” over the transaction. We don’t want it to be just another place to see ads. We need a better way to make decisions.
